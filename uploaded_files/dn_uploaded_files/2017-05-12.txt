Getabaru Raja Maha Viharaya tea ceremony  will be held annually
The new tea ceremony held at the sacred Getabaru Raja Maha Viharaya in Kotapola will be an annual event, Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake said.
Tea producers offered a portion of the first tea they produced after the Sinhala New Year to the temple at the festival, which was organised for the first time in this regard.
The Minister was addressing the gathering after making his offerings to the sacred temple last morning accompanied by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake.
Although 150 years have passed since the tea industry began in Sri Lanka, this is the first time that a ceremony like this is held. We should be thankful to Russia and China for purchasing more Ceylon tea as it has boosted the price of green tea to over Rs. 105 a kilo.
We hope that the price will go up to as much as Rs 150 per kilo within our tenure, he said.
Minister Sagala Rathnayaka said it was imperative that all tea plantations older than 20 years be replanted to increase production.
I do not use chemical fertilisers or pesticides in the sections I have replanted. Increasing the density of plants as recommended now, results in the automatic control of the growth of weeds. We should be able to add value to our produce. The price of tea fluctuates regularly and I believe that the present price will remain stable for some time, he said.
A large number of producers of tea in the Galle and the Matara Districts reached the Getabaru Raja Maha Viharaya in a procession to take part in the festival.
The ceremony was organised by the Sri Lanka Tea Board as part of the 150th anniversary celebrations of Ceylon Tea. The first commercial tea plantation in the country was established in 1867.

One who lives with the Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma: President at UN Vesak Week

President Maithripala Sirisena, addressing the inauguration of the UN Vesak week in Colombo said the solution to all ills was contained in the Dhamma.
As Buddhists we know that the solutions for the social, economic, political and cultural issues arisen both nationally and internationally are in the Buddhist philosophy. Dhammo Bhave Rakkhathi Dhamma Chari  One who lives with Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma, Najachcha Vasalo Hothi, Najachcha Hothi Brahmano  Not by birth is one an outcast, not by birth is one a Brahmana. By deed is one an outcast, by deed is one a Brahmana.
The importance of this message given in the Buddhist philosophy to find solutions to most conflicts, to make the society calm and to make the humans meritorious is immeasurable, the President said.
His message in full is reproduced below: I am pleased to speak at this noble ceremony, held under the patronage of honorable Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi to mark the commencement of the United Nations International Day of Vesak as part of the Vesak week celebrated in Sri Lanka.
We have no way of measuring Sri Lankas relationship with Buddhist philosophy and India (Maha Bharatha) for a long period of time in the history.
The friendship between India and Sri Lanka which is based on Buddhist philosophy is existing since ancient times.
As the leader of the Maha Bharatha the premier of India where the birth, enlightenment and mahanibbana of the Buddha occurred, visits us with rekindling the message of Vesak.
The Indian Prime Minister is refreshing the message of the Buddhist philosophy brought here by Arhath Mihinda Thero and Sanghamiththa Theri following the great Buddhist transformation initiated by Emperor Ashoka.
I extend my special thanks to Prime Minister Modi for participating in this event by accepting our invitation.
As Buddhists we know that the solutions for the social, economic, political and cultural issues arisen both nationally and internationally are in the Buddhist philosophy.
Dhammo Bhave Rakkhathi Dhamma Chari One who lives with Dhamma is protected by the Dhamma. Najachcha Vasalo Hothi  Najachcha Hothi Brahmano Not by birth is one an outcast, not by birth is one a Brahmana. By deed is one an outcast, by deed is one a Brahmana.
The importance of this message given in the Buddhist philosophy to find solutions to most conflicts, to make the society calm and to make the humans meritorious is immeasurable.
One of the significance of the activities today on the UN Vesak Day celebration is the fact that the whole world wonders why the Indian Prime Minister visits Sri Lanka Along with that the message of Vesak goes to the world.
When then late Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar during the period of Madam Chandrika Bandaranaike, suggested to declare Vesak Day as an International Day of Observance at the UN, the attention of the whole world was drawn towards the Vesak Day.
Particularly the attention of the non-Buddhist communities has drawn in this regard. They wonder, what is this Day of Vesak In that context they will tend to explore on Gautama Buddhas teachings and the Theravada Buddhist Philosophy.
Today, the western philosophers promote the Buddhist Philosophy to heal all the agitated minds, with a clear understanding of this philosophy.
Holding an International Vesak Day in Sri Lanka is not only important to us. It is a great endeavor for the whole world, as well as it will not only important to the Buddhist community, but also for the non-Buddhist communities.
We can learn lessons from the teaching of Buddhism to build a better society and to ensure the peace in the country while uniting us in a virtuous initiative like this. We have many things to study and to practice in Buddhism to build harmony among the communities as well as in creating a prosperous economy.
As a Buddhist country and as a centre for Theravada Buddhism, I wish strengthen and courage for all of us to be able to build a better society with better human hearts to heal our country as well as the world, through this noble effort.
I want to extend my thanks to the Maha Sangha, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the foreign representatives attending this UN Vesak Day event.
Theruwan Saranai.

Some do not understand importance of promoting reconciliation
Certain people do not fully understand the importance of promoting national reconciliation. Some blame me for supporting certain ethnic groups. Children all are alike despite their ethnicity and religion. They have a right for education, Dr. Pannila Sri Ananda Thera said.
The Thera was addressing the gathering after opening a fully completed Dhamma school for schoolchildren in Dabana recently as a part of an educational promotion programme implemented by the Thera.
The Chief Incumbent of the Huston Buddhist Temple in America, the Thera is the Chief Prelate of the Sri Arahantha Raja Maha Viharaya in Attanagalla as well.
The Vedda Chief Vannila Atto said at the handing over ceremony of the school that the Dhamma School would enable their children to be more committed to a pious life style. He pointed out the importance of Dhamma education in connection to their lifestyle and said the school will be a foundation for the children to improve their social and psychological well-being.
The programme will enhance the national reconciliation process. It also comes in as an answer to religious uneasiness. I have sponsored a three-storey building worth Rs. 20 million for Al Akbar Madya Maha Vidyalaya, an Islamic school in Thihariya and a two-storey building worth Rs. 20 million for St. Marys College in Veyangoda. Kirindiwela Sanghamitta Maha Vidyalaya received a Rs. 10 million worth building as a part of the programme. the Thera said.
An educated generation will despise racism and religious and otherwise discriminations.
They will make a better future for the country, the Thera said.

Buddhism and Politics

Lord Buddha had gone beyond all worldly affairs but still gave advice on good governance.
The Buddhist approach to political power is the moralization and the responsible use of public power. Lord Buddha preached non-violence and peace as a universal message. He did not approve of violence or the destruction of life, and declared that there is no such thing as a just war. He taught: The victor breeds hatred, the defeated lives in misery. He who renounces both victory and defeat is happy and peaceful. Not only did the Buddha teach non-violence and peace, He was perhaps the first and only religious teacher who went to the battlefield personally to prevent the outbreak of a war. He diffused tension between the Sakyas and the Koliyas who were about to wage war over distribution rights of the waters of Rohini. He also dissuaded King Ajatasattu from attacking the Kingdom of the Vajjis.
Lord Buddha discussed the importance and the prerequisites of a good government. He showed how the country could become corrupt, degenerate and unhappy when the head of the government becomes corrupt and unjust. He spoke against corruption and how a government should act based on humanitarian principles.
Lord Buddha once said: When the ruler of a country is just and good, the ministers become just and good, when the ministers are just and good, the higher officials become just and good, when the higher officials are just and good, the rank and file become just and good, when the rank and file become just and good, the people become just and good.
(ANGUTTARA NIKAYA)
In the CAKKAVATTI SIHANADA SUTTA, Lord Buddha said that immorality and crime, such as theft, falsehood, violence, hatred, cruelty, could arise from poverty. Kings and governments may try to suppress crime through punishment, but it is futile to eradicate crimes through force.
In the KUTADANTA SUTTA, Lord Buddha suggested economic development instead of force to reduce crime. The government should use the countrys resources to improve the economic conditions of the country. It could embark on agricultural and rural development, provide financial support to those who undertake an enterprise and business, provide adequate wages for workers to maintain a decent life with human dignity.
In the JATAKA stories, Lord Buddha gave 10 rules for Good Government, known as Dasa Raja Dharma. These ten rules can be applied even today by any government which wishes to rule the country peacefully. According to these rules a ruler must:
1. Be liberal and avoid selfishness,
2. Maintain a high moral character,
3. Be prepared to sacrifice his own pleasure for the well being of the subjects,
4. Be honest and maintain absolute integrity,
5. Be kind and gentle,
6. Lead a simple life for the subjects to emulate,
7. Be free from hatred of any kind,
8. Exercise non violence,
9. Practice patience, and
10. Respect public opinion to promote peace and harmony.
Regarding the behavior of rulers, He further advised:
1. A good ruler should act impartially and should not be biased and discriminate between one particular group of subjects against another.
2. A good ruler should not harbour any form of hatred against any of his subjects.
3. A good ruler should show no fear whatsoever in the enforcement of the law, if it is justifiable.
4. A good ruler must possess a clear understanding of the law to be enforced. It should not be enforced just because the ruler has the authority to enforce the law. It must be done in a reasonable manner and with common sense. (CAKKAVATTI SIHANADA SUTTA)
In the MILINDA PANHA, it is stated: If a man, who is unfit, incompetent, immoral, improper, unable and unworthy of kingship, has enthroned himself a king or a ruler with great authority, he is subject to a variety of punishment by the people, because, being unfit and unworthy, he has placed himself unrighteously in the seat of sovereignty. The ruler, like others who violate and transgress moral codes and basic rules of all social laws of mankind, is equally subject to punishment; and moreover, to be censured is the ruler who conducts himself as a robber of the public. In a Jataka story, it is mentioned that a ruler who punishes innocent people and does not punish the culprit is not suitable to rule a country.
The king always improves himself and carefully examines his own conduct in deeds, words and thoughts, trying to discover and listen to public opinion as to whether or not he had been guilty of any faults and mistakes in ruling the kingdom. If it is found that he rules unrighteously, the public will complain that they are ruined by the wicked ruler with unjust treatment, punishment, taxation, or other oppressions including corruption of any kind, and they will react against him in one way or another. On the contrary, if he rules righteously they will bless him: Long live His Majesty. (MAJJHIMA NIKAYA)

Buddhism's message of peace, the answer to growing arc of violence: Modi at UN Vesak Week [Video]

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told an audience of dignitaries at the inauguration of the UN Vesak Week in Colombo, he believed the Buddhist message of peace to be the answer to the growing arc of violence the world over.
The biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today may not be necessarily from conflict between the nation states. It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.
The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion. Sadly, these ideologies of hate and their proponents in our region are not open to dialogue and hence only open to causing death and destruction.
I firmly believe that Buddhism's message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world, the Indian Premier said.
The full speech is reproduced below:
Vesak is most sacred of days.
A day for humanity to revere the birth, the enlightenment and the Parinibbana of Lord Buddha, the "Tathagatha".
A day to rejoice in Buddha. A day to reflect on the supreme truth and timeless relevance of Dhamma, and the four noble truths.
A day to contemplate the ten perfections of <U+0926><U+093E><U+0928>(generosity); <U+0938><U+0940><U+0932>(proper conduct); <U+0928><U+0947><U+0916><U+094D><U+0916><U+094D><U+092E>(renunciation); <U+092A><U+093F><U+0902><U+0928><U+094D><U+092F><U+093E>(wisdom); <U+0935><U+0940><U+0930><U+093F>(energy); <U+0916><U+094D><U+0928><U+094D><U+0928><U+094D><U+0924><U+0940>(tolerance); <U+0938><U+091A><U+094D><U+091A>(truthfulness); <U+0905><U+0926><U+093F><U+0924><U+094D><U+0920><U+093E><U+0928>(determination); <U+092E><U+0947><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924><U+093E>(loving kindness) and <U+0909><U+092A><U+0947><U+0916><U+094D><U+0916><U+093E>(equanimity).
It is a day of enormous significance for you here in Sri Lanka, for us in India, and for Buddhists around the world. And, I am most grateful to Excellency President Maithripala Sirisena, Excellency Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the people of Sri Lanka for extending to me the honour to be the Chief Guest at the International Vesak Day festivities in Colombo.
On this auspicious occasion, I also bring with me the greetings of 1.25 billion people from the land of the Samyaksambuddha, the perfectly self-awakened one.
Excellencies, and Friends, Our region is blessed to have given to the world the invaluable gift of Buddha and his teachings.
Bodh Gaya in India, where Prince Siddhartha became the Buddha, is the sacred nucleus of the Buddhist universe. Lord Buddha's first sermon in Varanasi,which I have the honour to represent in the Parliament,set in motion the wheel of Dhamma.
Our key national symbols have taken inspiration from Buddhism. Buddhism and its various strands are deep seated in our governance, culture and philosophy.
The divine fragrance of Buddhism spread from India to all corners of the globe. Mahindra and Sanghamitra, the worthy children of King Ashoka made their journey from India to Sri Lankaas <U+0927><U+092E><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E><U+0926><U+0942><U+0924>to spread the biggest gift of <U+0927><U+092E><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E>.And, as Buddha had himself said: <U+0938><U+092C><U+094D><U+092C><U+094D><U+0926><U+093E><U+0928><U+093E><U+092E><U+0927><U+092E><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E><U+0926><U+093E><U+0928><U+0902><U+091C><U+0928><U+093E><U+0924><U+0940>, meaning, the gift of <U+0927><U+092E><U+094D><U+092E><U+093E>is the biggest gift of all.
Today, Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning. Centuries later, Anagarika Dharmapala undertook a similar journey, but this time, from Sri Lanka to India to revive the spirit of Buddha in the land of its origin.
In some way, you took us back to our own roots. The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage.
Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate this unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism. A heritage that connects our societies across generations and through centuries. Friends, The friendship between India and Sri Lanka was etched in time by the "Great Master".
Buddhism imparts an ever-present radiance to our relationship. As close neighbours, our relationship spreads across many layers. It draws its strength as much through our interconnected values of Buddhism as it does from the limitless possibilities of our shared future.
Ours is a friendship that lives in the hearts of our people and in the fabric of our societies. To honour and deepen our links of Buddhist heritage, I have the great pleasure to announce that from August this year,Air India will operate direct flights between Colombo and Varanasi.
This will ease travel to the land of Buddha for my brothers and sisters from Sri Lanka, and help you directly visit Sravasti, Kusinagar, Sankasa, Kaushambi and Sarnath.
My Tamil brothers and sisters will also be able to visit Varanasi, the land of Kashi Viswanath.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and Friends, I believe we are at a moment of great opportunity in our ties with Sri Lanka. An opportunity to achieve a quantum jump in our partnership across different fields. And, for us, the most relevant benchmark for the success of our friendship is your progress and success. We are committed to the economic prosperity of our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters.
We will continue to invest in driving positive change and economic growth to deepen our development cooperation. Our strength lies in sharing our knowledge, capacity and prosperity. In trade and investment, we are already significant partners.
We believe that free flow of trade, investments, technology, and ideas across our borders will be to our mutual benefit.
Indias rapid growth can bring dividends for the entire region, especially in Sri Lanka. In infrastructure and connectivity, transport and energy, we are poised to scale up our cooperation. Our development partnership stretches across nearly every sector of human activity such as agriculture, education, health, resettlement, transport, power, culture, water, shelter, sports, and human resources.
Today ,Indias development cooperation with Sri Lanka amounts to US Dollars 2.6 billion. And, its only aim is to support Sri Lanka in realizing a peaceful, prosperous and secure future for its people. Because, the economic and social well being of the people of Sri Lanka is linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians. Because, whether it is on land or in the waters of the Indian Ocean, the security of our societies is indivisible.
My conversations with President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have only reinforced our will to join hands in achieving our common goals.
As you make important choices for the harmony and progress of your society, you will find in India a friend and partner that will support your nation-building endeavours.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and Friends, Lord Buddhas message is as relevant in the twenty first century as it was two and a half millennia ago. The <U+092E><U+0927><U+094D><U+092F><U+092E><U+092A><U+094D><U+0930><U+0924><U+093F><U+092A><U+0926><U+093E>, the Middle Path shown by Buddha, speaks to all of us.
Its universality and evergreen nature is striking. It has been a unifying force among nations. The countries of South, Central, South East and East Asia are proud of their Buddhist links traced to the land of Buddha.
The themes of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace, chosen for the Vesak day, resonate deeply with Buddha's teachings. The themes may appear independent. But, they are both deeply interdependent and interconnected. The issue of Social justice is linked to conflict within and among communities.
This arises principally because of <U+0924><U+0928><U+094D><U+0939><U+093E>or (<U+0924><U+0943><U+0937><U+094D><U+0923><U+093E>in Sanskrit), the thirst, which in turn stems from greed . Greed has driven the mankind to dominate and degrade our natural habitat. Our desire to achieve all our wants has created income inequalities in communities and disturbed social harmony.
Similarly, the biggest challenge to Sustainable World Peace today may not be necessarily from conflict between the nation states. It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence.
The menace of terrorism in our region is a concrete manifestation of this destructive emotion.
Sadly, these ideologies of hate and their proponents in our region are not open to dialogue and hence only open to causing death and destruction.
I firmly believe that Buddhism's message of peace is the answer to growing arc of violence all over the world. And, not just a negative notion of peace defined by the absence of conflict. But, a positive peace where we all work to promote dialogue, harmony and justice, based on compassion and wisdom. As Buddha said,"<U+0928><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924><U+0940><U+0938><U+0902><U+0924><U+093F><U+092A><U+0930><U+0923><U+0938><U+0941><U+0916><U+0902>", "there is no higher bliss than peace".
On Vesak, my hope is that India and Sri Lanka will work together to uphold the ideals of Lord Buddha and promote values of peace, accommodation, inclusiveness, and compassion in the policies and conduct of our governments.
This is the true path to free individuals, families, societies, nations and the world at large from the three poisons of greed, hatred and ignorance.
Venerable Monks, Excellencies and friends, On the blessed day of Vesak, let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth. And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world.
As the verse 387 of Dhammapada says:
<U+0926><U+093F><U+0935><U+093E><U+0924><U+092A><U+0924><U+093F><U+0906><U+0926><U+093F><U+091A><U+094D><U+091A><U+094B>,<U+0930><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924><U+093F><U+0902><U+0917><U+0913><U+092D><U+093E><U+0924><U+093F><U+091A><U+0902><U+0926><U+093F><U+092E><U+093E>.<U+0938><U+0928><U+094D><U+0928><U+094D><U+0926><U+094D><U+0927><U+094B><U+0916><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924><U+093F><U+092F><U+094B><U+0924><U+092A><U+0924><U+093F>,<U+091D><U+093E><U+092F><U+0940><U+0924><U+092A><U+0924><U+093F><U+092C><U+094D><U+0930><U+093E><U+0939><U+094D><U+092E><U+0923><U+094B><U+0902>.<U+0905><U+0925><U+0938><U+092C><U+094D><U+092C><U+092E><U+0905><U+0939><U+094B><U+0930><U+0924><U+094D><U+0924><U+093F><U+0902><U+0917>,<U+092C><U+0941><U+0926><U+094D><U+0927><U+094B><U+0924><U+092A><U+0924><U+093F><U+0924><U+0947><U+091C><U+0938><U+093E>.
Meaning:
The sun shines by the day, The moon lights up the night, The warrior shines in his armour, The Brahmin shines in his meditation, But, the awakened one shines all day and night by his radiance. Thank you once again for the honour to be with you. I look forward to paying homage at the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, in Kandy today afternoon. May the Triple Gem of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha bless us all.
Thank you, Thank you very much.

Buddhist Contribution to World Peace and Sustainable Development
In this study, what the Buddha said about peace, justice, and freedom  is important to learn, especially in the context of our muchplagued modern world. The concept of peace is central to Buddhism. Therefore, the Buddha is called the Santiraja king of peace. Leading a Buddhist way of life, is to maintain harmonious, untroubled good life, which consists of samacariya, which literally means, a harmonious life or a peaceful way of living with ones fellow beings. It is this doctrine, which gives inward peace that allows externally to lead a harmonious or a righteous living (Dhammacariya). This is what the Buddha, for the first time in human history, made known to the entire world, when he set up the kingdom of righteousness(dhamma cakkam) literally the rule of righteousness.
The Buddha, with great compassion for the world, required his followers to practice the four boundless states (appamanna) of loving kindness (metta), of compassion (karuna), of sympathetic joy (mudita), and of equanimity (upekkha). This practice of metta or universal love, begins by suffusing ones own mind with universal love (metta) and then pervading it to ones family, then to the neighbors, then to the village, country and the four corners of the Universe.
The concept of peace is expressed with the word Santi in both the ancient and modern languages of India. As Santi is described as the ideal state of man in Buddhist literature, we can say that Buddhism has aimed at peace in its long history. Sakyamuni Gotama, the Buddha deplored that the peaceful life of common people was seriously damaged owing to the conflicts of various states, which occurred during the rising of Buddhism. In the Majjhimanikaya: people seek riches, and kings want to expand their territories (Majjhimanikaya, Vol.II. p.72). Elsewhere mentioned, is the desire for kings to begin war, and bring trouble to the common people with disasters and damage.
How Buddhist Teachings contribute to Peace Negotiation and World Peace:
Today, the nations of the world face many problems, especially in the areas of human security and peace. After World War II, nations agreed to create the United Nations to establish peace and solidarity among different nations to avoid war, terror, aggression and invasion. But unfortunately, such a noble objective still has not become true, as many parts of the world still continue terrible war, territorial disputes, religious, ethnic and political conflicts etc. Because of these unfortunate situations, peaceloving people, including political and religious leaders, look for urgent and effective solutions to establish peace for the planet. In this work, we find out some positive guidelines for world peace in the light of Buddhist teachings. In the Samyuttanikaya (Vol. I, p.26) and in the Chinese version of Samyuktagama (Vol.39. Taisho, Vol.II, p.88c), it clearly notes that the secular world advocates the ideal of realizing peace and politics should be advanced: without killing, without hurting, without conquering, without becoming sad, without making sadness, only complying with the Law of Dhamma. Early Buddhists made efforts so that wars would not occur, and persuaded other monarchs to that effect. When Ajatasattu, the King of Magadha wanted to attack the Vajjis neighboring country, and sought out the opinion of Sakyamuni, the Buddha through his wise minister Vassakara, the Buddha admonished him not to go for a war (Mahaparinibbanasuttanta).
The ideal of benevolence was emphasized in Buddhism and pacifism or peaceful environment was always advocated. In Buddhism, the ideal ruler should govern his country with modern policies and maintain peace without invading other countries. This idea was repeated in the Chinese Tripitaka (Taisho, vol.13, p.733a), mentioning that  A king should fulfil the duties of a king, which have been observed by his ancestors, cherish all the subjects in his country, guard his own country and not invade territories of others. The same Tripitaka gives additional information concerning the Cakravartin or Universal monarch and how one should conduct his policy visavis neighboring countries and rulers. The text says that Cakravartin, does not threaten people with force, gives up weapons, and does not hurt people. Then, people and rulers under his power do not move from heir own abodes. As a result of that, all countries surrender to him without being forced by means of weapons. In some other place,
there is a record stating that a pious and wise king should conquer the four quarters with virtues, and fulfill his duties. The Buddhacarita (Taisho, Vol. 17. p. 515a), notes that the King Suddhodana, father of Sakyamuni, is lauded as having defeated his enemies by good deeds, without war. To avoid engaging in war, a technique from the Dharmasamuccayasutra, proposes: even if an army of another country should invade and plunder, a king should know first whether his soldiers are brave or cowardly, and then conclude peace by means of expediency.
When maintaining peaceful negotiations between two territories, there is always something to work out. Such ideals need to be realized to some extent. An Indian monk known as Gunavarman visited China in the early days  a Chinese king asked him: When foreign armies are going to invade my country, what should I do If we fight, there must be many casualties. If we do not repulse them, my country will be imperiled. O master, please tell me what to do The monk answered: just entertain a compassionate mind, do not have hurtful mind. The king applied his advice. When the banners were going to be hoisted and the drums beaten, the enemies retreated (Taisho, vol.50, p. 340b). The above mentioned passage teaches us not to fight against enemies. They do not teach us to repulse them deliberately. But, when enemies invade into the country what should we do A king should observe the duty of protecting the country. Otherwise, the enemies take advantage of the peaceful attitude of the king. His subject may rebel.
The same text clearly explains the necessary expediency in details. It is the duty of a king to protect his country he must repel invading enemies. The text explains how to carry on a battle to save the people and the kingdom as follows: in the first place if the enemy is as powerful as his own army, the warfare will inflict damage for both armies. There is no benefit for any one, but may lose many human lives. If the enemy is more powerful than his army, then the army should abandon war and the king should look for a peace settlement through negotiations with good enemy officers' then, avoiding a possible war and the killing of innocent people. Secondly, in such cases, he should try to solve the conflict by showing generosity and giving anything the enemy required, then violence would be prevented. Thirdly, if the enemy seems to be more powerful, and his force is less powerful, he should try to solve the conflict by arousing astonishment in the mind of the enemy king by pretending his own army is a more powerful force. If these three ways fail, then he is allowed to take up arms, keeping the following thoughts: on account of the lack of mercy on the part of enemy, we engage in war and the killing of living beings. However, we hope that we will kill as few as possible. In the above three circumstances Buddhist teachings advise not to go to war but to negotiation to bring peace upon both parties.
A Buddhist Road Map for Sustainable Development of World Peace:
According to Buddhism, conflict, intolerance and disharmony arises out of desires, hatred and ignorance. To develop confidence, tolerance, and harmony it is extremely important to cultivate common values or universal ethics. Therefore, promotion of education, dialogue, social and economic development would lead for sustainable development of peace in the world. The Buddha welcomed teachers of other religions, but he never attempted to convert any or urged any one to change their beliefs, traditions or teachers. In this regards, we find evidence throughout the Pali Canon where wandering ascetics, sophists and philosophers come to meet the Buddha and discussed or exchanged their different views concerning the way of spiritual practice and liberation. In the Brahmajalasutta the Buddha summarizes the main ideas of his contemporary teachers by saying the following words:
You may remember this exposition as the net of aim, the net of doctrines, the supreme net  the net of religious - philosophic theories and the glorious victory in the war of ideologies (Dighanikaya, Brahmajalasutta).
Today, it has become an urgent necessity to provide avenues to build world peace through understanding different cultures and religions' because, the causes of religious and ethnic conflict in the world today have their roots in the misunderstanding religious beliefs and misinterpretation of sacred texts. Therefore, it is important to apply the wisdom of the Buddha to extend understanding through learning the religious beliefs of others through direct contact and dialogue. This approach in the modern world requires tolerance in a deeper understanding that all religions may have common ground on which bridges could be built to establish trust and acceptance, and therefore peace and harmony.
United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) at its 161st session of the Executive Board in 2001 examined a resolution on dialogue among civilizations, which states as follows:
Only dialogue ends war, and the dialogue of peace is very much a cultural dialogue as well. Many nations and peoples nurse memories of historic grievances and cultural slights. Dialogue alone brings these clearly into the open, where they may be assessed with full intellectual honesty and deep concern for one anothers merits. Only then can past wrongs be finally laid to rest. Cultural dialogue thus helps dispel the germs of war, and sows the seeds of peace and any chance for lasting, harmonious development. UNESCO is one of the worlds forums for such dialogue. The dialogue fostered is predicated upon universal acceptance and observance of basic human rights, as enshrined by the Universal Declaration of 1948, to which all the organizations members are committed. Within this broad moral framework, each culture knows that its voice is heard, weighed, and respected.
The Buddha, with his great compassion for the world required his followers to practice the four boundless states (appamanna) of loving kindness (metta), of compassion (karuna), of sympathetic joy (mudita), and of equanimity (upekkha). This practice of metta or universal love, begins by suffusing ones own mind with universal love (metta) and then pervading it to ones family, then to the neighbors, then to the village, country and the outer regions of the Universe.
The Buddhist doctrine of universal love and compassion was practiced by the Great Indian Emperor Asoka, with his mind pervading with loving kindness, said thus: All men are my children, and as I desire for my children that they obtain every kind of welfare and happiness, both in this world and the next world, so do I desire for all men.
The King Asokas Rock Edict XIII, states, that when he embraced Buddhism, he indulged in spiritual conquest saying that: the war drums are now replaced by the drum of the dharma. Some scholars say that the King Asoka, was trying to emulate the example of a righteous universal monarch (cakkavatti raja) as depicted in the Buddhist texts. Elsewhere, the Buddha said that: it was possible to rule a country in accordance with dharma without resorting to harsh punishment (S.I.116). The universal monarch who is called a king of righteousness governs his country as a model state in which there is both economic prosperity, as well as righteousness.
The concept of a just society is unthinkable today in our modern world, until and unless the people reduce their unlimited desire, hatred and ignorance.
A just society may be establish in the world, when the nations and rulers of the world stop the fabrication of arms of mass destruction, and use that wealth for mass construction, through social development and elimination of social injustice.
The international community has recognized, that social inequality leads to ethnic and political violence, theft, and other forms of crime. Revolutions, wars, and terrorism in general have as a root cause, an imbalance of: wealth distribution, political power, educational and professional opportunities. The Buddha viewed extreme poverty as a cause of violence. Therefore, the Buddha suggested in the Kutadanta Sutta, in the Digha Nikaya, the following solution to prevent violence:
Per chance His Majesty might think, I will soon put a stop to these scoundrels game by degradation and punishment, and fines and imprisonment and execution. But the criminal actions of bandits who pillage villages and towns and make roads unsafe cannot be satisfactorily put to a stop. The criminals left unpunished would still go on harassing the realm. Now there is one method to adopt to put a thorough end to this disorder' to those who keep cattle and cultivate farms, let the king give fodder and seedcorn. To those who trade, let the king give wages and food Then these people, following each ones own business, will no longer harass the realm. The kings revenue will go up and the realm will be quite and at peace. The populace, pleased with one another and happy, dancing with their children in their arms, will dwell with open doors.
Though, the Buddha took no interest in shaping political situations, he was directly involved with politically active people. He took advantage of every occasion to admonish such people to maintain moral standards, to act with responsibility and to work for peace within the country, and with the neighboring countries. The Mahaparinibbana Sutta provides and example of the Buddhas idea on statecraft, and even his sympathy for a republicform of government.
It is important to note that the Buddhas struggle was to establish a society, where all human beings could live with dignity, irrespective of their birth, caste, class, sex, and religion. Therefore, the Buddha repeatedly stood against unequal treatment of any human being. He wanted a society free from: violence, discrimination of ethnic, and with religious and professional opportunity. His vision for society, which existed in the 6th century BCE, is still valid to our modern society in the modern world. Whether deliberately or unknowingly, the United Nations is forging ahead with its noble mission to work for the betterment of humanity, with the same theme and same solutions that the Compassionate Buddha thought out during his time, 2500 years ago.

Fence the strikes
General Trade Union actions are a violation of the people's right of rule by an elected government.
A trade union should not have the right to strike on any demands other than matters that directly concern their vocation. The decision to strike itself should be made only after a secret ballot among the members and after a ruling by an independent Tribunal. The cause is genuinely related to a grievance of the particular Union members.
Such a clause should be included in the new constitution even if a public referendum is required. That will ensure public convenience at least to some extent. That will also keep business-minded people from manipulating the sacred professions such as the medical field.

A CLARION CALL TO ENGINEERS
I read a very interesting article by Priyal de Silva, retired General Manager, Sri Lanka Railways where he gives the history of Railway Signal System commencing from 1964 when the first Colour Light Signals were installed between Veyangoda and Panadura by our own railway engineers. In saying so he refers to the China Huge Signal Controller and this could have been handled by our railway engineers and technicians and generate encouragement, enthusiasm among locals to produce the necessary spares and equipment for the signaling systems, and skills for national development by saving scarce capital resources.
Most importantly, he says, minimize countrys foreign debt, the necessity to sell/lease national assets to settle debts and also maximize employment creation for our own labour and entrepreneurship, thereby economic growth. This reminds me of getting the Indian Company to relay the Northern Railway line which was destroyed during the LTTE uprising. Surely, this could have been done by our own Railway Way & Works Department.
Railway engineers and technicians
The work involved was laying of rails, sleepers, ballasting and strengthening bridges as the track itself was compact and sound.
The credibility and efficiency of our railway engineers and technicians could be judged, how they handled the wash away of the track during Tsunami and also if one can remember the 1947 floods where the line was washed off from Peradeniya to Gampola, the work was carried out expeditiously. If this work too was entrusted to our railway engineers, the work would have been completed at a lesser cost and quick time.
In fact what is happening now is that the country which provides the loan, does the work, using their men, materials and machinery, paying themselves from the loan, and we have to pay back the loan with interest.
The expressways and road construction work done by Chinese could have been easily handled by our civil engineers of the present Road Development Authority (RDA) at a lesser cost but as said earlier, the country which provided the loan, paid itself.
This brings to my mind and incident where the World Bank in the 1960s funded construction of (subject to correction) 12 bridges and one of the condition was that tenders should only be issued to member countries and the loan receiving country is not entitled to tender.
The then Chief Engineer (Bridges) M. Chandrasena, made a claim that the Public Works Department (PWD) be allowed as the Bridges department was well equipped and had a Pre-stressed Concrete Yard (a pet project of M. Chandrasena) I cannot remember whether this was allowed, but the fact remains that our engineers demonstrated their capabilities to match foreign experts.
Local expertise
Quite correctly and no ambiguity Priyal de Silva has concluded by saying It is their duty (Government) to implement public investment projects such as those that could use local labour, entrepreneurial and other physical inputs to the maximum extent, and be steered by local expertise, rather than investing in foreign procurements on a turnkey basis with foreign borrowings, which provides little or no benefit to the national economy or to the public at large. It is hoped, our engineers in all disciplines - civil, electrical, mechanical come forward to assure the governments of their unstinting support and pressurize the authorities to pay heed for the sake of nation building, and save the country of foreign debt burden.
The parting shot - of course is will our politicians concede to the request of engineers, keeping in mind the much hyped accusation of Lining their pockets.

Diversity calls for celebration not confrontation: Modi At Dickoya Hospital inauguration [Video]

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi today inaugurated the Dickoya Hospital that was built with Indian assistance.
Addressing the community of upcountry Tamils at the occasion he evoked the shared heritage between India and Sri Lanka.
You speak one of the oldest-surviving classical languages in the world. It is a matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala. Language is much more than a tool for communication. It defines a culture, forges relationships, joins communities and acts as a strong unifying force, the Indian Premier said.
There is no better sight than a multilingual society living in peace and harmony. Diversity calls for celebration; and not confrontation. Our past has always been harmoniously inter-woven. Several Buddhist texts including Jataka tales mention Saint Agastya, whom many consider to be the father of Tamil language.
The Sinhalese Nayak Kings of Kandy had matrimonial alliances with the Nayak Kings of Madurai and Tanjore. Sinhala and Tamil were the court languages. Hindu and Buddhist shrines were both respected and revered. We need to strengthen, not separate, these threads of unity and harmony, the Indian Premier said.
Excerpts of his speech are given below.
It is a great pleasure to be here today. And, I am most grateful for your warm and enthusiastic welcome.
It is a tremendous honour to be the first Indian Prime Minister ever to visit this beautiful region of Sri Lanka. But, it is a greater honour to have the opportunity to speak with you.
People the world over are familiar with famous Ceylon Tea that originates in this fertile land.
What is less known is that it is your sweat and toil that makes the Ceylon Tea the brew of choice for millions around the globe.
If Sri Lanka today is the third largest exporter of tea, it is because of your hard work.
It is your labour of love, which is instrumental in Sri Lanka meeting almost 17% of the worlds demand for tea, and earning more than 1.5 billion US dollars in foreign exchange.
You are that indispensable backbone of the thriving Sri Lankan tea industry that justly prides itself on its success and global reach today. Your contribution is deeply valued across Sri Lanka and beyond. I for one truly appreciate your hard work. You and I have something in common.
As some of you may have heard, I have a special association with tea. Chai pe Charcha, or discussions over tea, is not just a slogan. Rather, a mark of deep respect for the dignity and integrity of honest labour. Today, we remember your forefathers.
Those men and women of strong will and courage, who undertook the journey of their life from India to then Ceylon. Their journey may have been uphill and their struggles hard, but they never gave up. Today, we remember and salute that spirit.
Your generation also faced relentless hardships. You encountered the stiff challenge of making your own mark and identity in a newly independent nation. But, you faced them boldly; you fought for your rights, but you did so peacefully.
We will never forget leaders like Saumiyamurthy Thondaman, who worked hard for your rights, for your upliftment and economic prosperity.
Kaniyan Pungunranar, a Tamil Scholar had declared more than two millennia ago, Yaathum Oore; Yavarum Kelir, meaning Every town is hometown and all people are our kin. And, you have captured the true spirit of that saying. You have made Sri Lanka your home.
You are an intrinsic part of the warp and the weft of the social fabric of this beautiful nation.
You are the children of Tamil Thai.
You speak one of the oldest-surviving classical languages in the world. It is a matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala. And, language is much more than a tool for communication.
It defines a culture, forges relationships, joins communities and acts as a strong unifying force. There is no better sight than a multilingual society living in peace and harmony.
Diversity calls for celebration; and not confrontation. Our past has always been harmoniously inter-woven.
Several Buddhist texts including Jataka tales mention Saint Agastya, whom many consider to be the father of Tamil language. The Sinhalese Nayak Kings of Kandy had matrimonial alliances with the Nayak Kings of Madurai and Tanjore. Sinhala and Tamil were the court languages.
Hindu and Buddhist shrines were both respected and revered. We need to strengthen, not separate, these threads of unity and harmony. And, you are perhaps best placed to lead such efforts and make your contribution. I come from the State of Gujarat in India, the birth place of Mahatma Gandhi.
Almost 90 years ago, he visited this beautiful part of Sri Lanka, including Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Matale, Badulla, Bandarawela and Hatton. Gandhijis first and only visit to Sri Lanka was about spreading the message of socio-economic development.
In commemoration of that historic visit, the Mahatma Gandhi International Centre was set up with Government of India assistance at Matale in 2015.
Another national icon of India from later years, Puratchi Thalaivar MGR was born on this very soil, establishing a life-long connection. And, in more recent times, you have gifted to the world one of the finest spinners in cricket, Muthiah Muralitharan.
Your progress is our pride. We take much joy from your accomplishments in various walks of life. We rejoice in the success of the Indian-origin diaspora as they leave a mark across the world, near and far.
I look forward to many more shining successes. You form an important link between Indian and Sri Lankan people and government. We see you as part of seamless continuum of our ties with this beautiful country.
It is my Governments priority to nurture these links. And, shape our partnership and engagement in a manner that ultimately contributes to the progress of all Indians and all Sri Lankans, and also touches your lives. You have kept your bonds with India alive. You have friends and relatives in India.
You celebrate Indian festivals as your own. You have soaked our culture and made it your own. India beats in your hearts. And, I am here to tell you that India fully reciprocates the warmth of your sentiment. We will continue to work tirelessly for your socio-economic upliftment in all possible ways.
I am aware that the Government of Sri Lanka is taking active steps to improve your living conditions, including a 5-year National Plan of Action.
India will fully support their efforts in this direction. India has also undertaken many projects for your well-being, together with Sri Lankan Government, particularly in education, health and community development sectors.
The Ceylon Estate Workers Education Trust (CEWET) was set up way back in 1947 in order to encourage promising students to continue their studies. Under this, we offer around 700 scholarships annually to students for studying in Sri Lanka and India.
Your children have benefited from this. In the area of livelihood and capacity building, we have set up vocational training centres and 10 English language training centres and labs to help impart suitable skill sets.
Similarly, we have helped set up computer and science labs in plantation schools. We are also upgrading a number of plantation schools. Just a while ago, President Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and I dedicated to the people a new 150-bed hospital complex in Dickoya, which has been constructed with Indian assistance.
Its state-of-the-art facilities will cater to the health care needs of the region. I am also pleased to announce that we have decided to extend the 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service, currently in operation in Western and Southern Provinces, to all the other Provinces as well.
We are also happy to share with you India's holistic healthcare traditions such as Yoga and Ayurveda.
As we celebrate the International Day of Yoga next month, we look forward to your active participation in popularising its multiple benefits.
As part of the innovative Indian Housing Project in Sri Lanka, 4000 houses are being constructed in upcountry areas. I am happy that for the first time, beneficiaries are also being given ownership of the land on which the houses are being built.
To continue our commitment in this area, I am delighted to announce the construction of an additional ten thousand houses in upcountry areas under this project. Earlier today, I announced direct Air India flights from Colombo to Varanasi.
With this, you would be able to visit Varanasi with ease and seek the blessings of Lord Shiva. The Government and people of India are with you in your journey towards peace and greater prosperity. We will help you overcome the challenges of your past to realise the promise of your future. As the great poet Thiruvalluvar said, Wealth will find its own way to the man of unfailing energy and efforts.
I am confident that it will be a bright future that matches the dreams and potential of your children and your heritage.
Thank you, Nandri.
Thank you very much.

EU approves GSP+ application
Formalities of entry process to be finalised next week
Concession withdrawn in 2010 due to Lankas poor human rights record

The Council of Ministers of the European Union (Foreign and Trade Ministers) formally approved Sri Lankas Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus or GSP+ application yesterday, thereby making it official that the country will regain the coveted trade concession.
This completes all three procedural requirements for Sri Lanka to receive GSP Plus status. The European Commission and Parliament approved the application earlier.
This is the final hurdle the country had to overcome, and next week they will finalise the formalities of the entry process, Director General of the Government Information Department Dr.Ranga Kalansooriya said. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also confirmed the news.
The GSP+ concession was withdrawn in 2010 due to Sri Lankas poor human rights record, and it has resulted in the loss of hundreds of millions of euros in exports, according to Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha de Silva.
The trade concessions will result in the removal of between 9-10 percent tax for exports to the EU. The GSP+ covers about 6,600 products, but Sri Lanka exports only a few of these.
Exports made up 34% of the countrys GDP in 2000, but that they had dropped to just 13% of GDP by 2015. There has not been a discernable improvement in exports in the last two years.
This is a great turnaround for our exports. One of the main reasons our diversification into other areas has not improved is because we have not been able to compete with other countries which have had a better relationship with the EU, de Silva said at a news conference in late April at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The benefits of the GSP+ could be short lived, however, as the countrys per capita income increase could make Sri Lanka ineligible for the trade concession. Countries that achieve upper-middle income status (about $4,036 per capita, according to the World Bank) for three consecutive years lose their GSP+ certification.
De Silva has stated that Sri Lanka hopes to reach middle-income status by the end of 2017, so the country would have three more years to benefit from GSP+. After those three years, the country would have to negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the EU to maintain favourable trade status.

Expulsion, resignation of NCP minister wont affect Councils functions: CM
North Central Province(NCP) Chief Minister Peshala Jayarathna Bandara emphasised that the expelling of ministers and the resignation of ministers in the council would not affect the functions,political stability and the Provincial Councils administration at all.
The North Central Governor has on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena removed Provincial Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister K.H.Nandsena from his ministerial portfolio. M. Herath Banda has already been appointed to the vacant post.
This incident is not at all a matter of political or personal revenge. I have nothing to do with these changes. However I feel that the main cause for this would be the opposition expressed by former minister Nandasena to the Lower Malwathuoya Reservoir Project Resolution AT the Provincial Council session agenda on May 9, he said.
Provincial Cooperatives Minister S.M.Ranjith told the media that he would resign from his portfolio in objection to the expulsion of the Minister Nandasena. He was entitled to do so as he wished. I have no comment about it, But, he has not so far submitted any letter of resignation to the authorities. I take every possible action to go ahead with our development plans and proposals without allowing them to get jeopardised due to such changes, the North Central Province Chief Minister Bandara concluded. Former minister Nandasena said that he was not given any prior notice of his removal. He said that the decision to expel him was an injustice done to him and a blow to the party supporters and public. Nandasena stated that he would never forget the immense service rendered to the party and country by the former President and his (Nandasena) personal political agenda was based on his past politics.
Provincial Cooperatives Minister S.M.Ranjith said it was no surprise that such injustices and short sighted policies were taking place. He said further that due to such step motherly treatment meted out to personalities of the calibre of Nandasena, the fragmentation of the SLFP would be accelerated.
Former Cabinet Minister S.M.Chandrasena emphasised that his brother who recorded a landslide victory at the last Provincial Council elections was offered the Chief Ministry portfolio after he (Chandrasena) resigned from the Cabinet to allow his brother to serve the people.

FA bans several England supporters  over Dortmund misconduct
LONDON, : The Football Association (FA) has banned several members of the England Supporters Travel Club as part of an investigation into the fans' inappropriate conduct during the March 22 friendly against Germany at Dortmund.
The FA along with the UK Football Policing Unit are investigating England supporters after they sang songs about World War II and booed the German national anthem during the friendly.
"Firstly, we would like to thank all England Supporters Travel Club members who have taken the time to make contact to express their disappointment and dismay at what they witnessed in Dortmund..." the organisation said in a statement. "We have been working closely with the relevant authorities to identify a number of individuals, some of whom have already been suspended from the England supporters travel club and will now be pursued by the UK football policing unit and potentially be subject to a football banning order.
"To date, 34 members have been investigated for their behaviour by the FA..."
The FA investigation is still ongoing and further sanctions might be handed out.

Following CA order  against Geetha: SPC member to challenge  legal validity of entire 2015 candidates list

Southern Provincial Councilor Jayantha Jayaweera told the media that he was going to initiate legal action in the Court of Appeal challenging the legal validity of the entire list of candidates who contested the 2015 Parliamentary election under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance ticket inconsideration of the legal postulations following the Court of Appeal(CA) order issued on May 3 declaring that Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament.
According to the election law, in case of a candidate of a list is disqualified following a court order or any other lawful objection, the same directive applies all other contestants of the respective list. Hence, according to the Court of Appeal decree unseating Geetha Kumarasinghe from her Parliamentary membership the whole of the UPFA list under consideration is also legally invalid, Councilor Jayaweera argued.
In support of his argument, he further pointed out a number contemporary election history incidents including the rejection of the United National Party candidates list at the Colombo Municipal Council election in 2005. In that incident, one of the 58 names in the UNP list was a name of a candidate who was not over the 18 year age limit stipulated by a circular of the then Elections Commissioner based on the election law.
At present, I am consulting our lawyers regarding the matter and studying the finer legal points over the issue. However, our lawyers assured that there is enough favourable grounds for us to initiate legal proceedings regarding the matter, Jayaweera further said.
In the event of an order is delivered disqualifying the whole UPFA Galle district list of candidates that contested at the previous Parliamentary election according to the aggregates of votes obtained by each party,a number of UNP MPs will be increased up to 9 and the Janatha Vimukthti Peramuna will get one seat in Parliament.
In the 2017 General Election, the UPFA obtained 312,518 votes securing 50.07% of the total number of valid votes while the UNP received 265,180 votes which was 42.48% of the total number of registered voters.The JVP received only 37,778 votes with a voter percentage of 6.05. Accordingly, 6 members were elected to Parliament from UPFA together with four UNP members.

Heroin worth Rs. 2B seized
Around 200 kilogrammes of heroin worth Rs.2 billion was seized at the Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary in the Chilaw coastal area yesterday morning. A suspect and a Defender vehicle were also taken into Police custody, sources from the Puttalam DIGs office said.
This is the largest haul of heroin detected in Sri Lanka in the recent past,Police media sources said. The heroin was packed in 198 plastic bags.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara says that the master-mind behind this heroin smuggling racket is suspected to be the same individual behind the recent Piliyandala incident where officers of the Police Narcotic Bureu came under attack.
The 58-year-old suspect,a resident of Dehiwala was arrested while attempting to transport the heroin yesterday. The Puttalam Police made the arrest after a three month investigation.
Preliminary investigations reveal that the heroin was brought by ship from Pakistan into Sri Lankan waters and then into a multi-day vessel. The multi-day vessel had then transferred the haul of heroin to a day-fishing vessel which carried it to the Muthupanthiya beach to be handed over to the suspect, who was arrested later.
The suspect is reported to have spent the previous night at a lodge in Chilaw waiting for the heroin parcels to arrive. It is revealed that the suspect transported the heroin to Colombo from Chilaw in the same manner on several occasions.
The arrest was made by a Police team under the directions of North Central Senior DIG Ravi Wijegunawardena, Puttalama DIG Champika Siriwardena, ASP A.A. Chandrasena and Inteligence Division OIC Jayalath Sunil.
The team also included SI Edirisinghe and Aruna Shantha, Constables Wijesinghe, Piyadasa, Herath, Ratnayake, Molagoda, Deshapriya, Sri Lal and Police Constable driver Cruz.

History - Conferences of the United Nations Day of Vesak

The Day of Vesak marks the birth, the Enlightenment and the demise of the Buddha. His birth heralded mans deliverance from suffering. His enlightenment was the discovery of the Truth notably the Four Noble truths and the Law of Dependent Origination. His demise was wake-up for the Right Mindfulness.
The three major events in the life of the Buddha signal the birth of Buddhism, a great phenomenon in the history of mankind. For this reason many Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Laos observe the day.
The commemoration of the Day of Vesak by Buddhists everywhere in the world aims to worship and honor the Compassion, the Wisdom and the Purity of the Buddha who taught humanity to be kind and tolerant towards each other, qualities which foster world peace.
In November 1998, at the International Buddhist Conference in Colombo, Sri Lanka, all member countries unanimously expressed the intention to gain International Recognition for the Day of Vesak, a symbol of the birth of Buddhism.
United Nations representatives of the following Buddhist countries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Laos, Maldives, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand, proposed to the UN General Assembly to adopt the resolution for the international Recognition of the Day of Vesak.
On 15 December 1999, the Plenary Meeting of the UN General Assembly at its 54th session considered the agenda item 174 and adopted the draft resolution for the International Recognition of the Day of Vesak and for the appropriate arrangements for its observe\ance at the UN Headquaters and other offices of the UN. 34 countries sponsored the draft resolution.
Since the year 2000, on that most auspicious day the full-moon in the sixth lunar month of the Day of Vesak, Buddhist countries have joined in the commemorative event at the UN Headquarters. Sri Lanka took the lead to coordinate the event in 2000 and 2001, followed by Myanmar in 2202, India in 2003. Thailand had the honor of hosting the event in 2004.

Hope for improved China, South Korea relations after leaders speak

The election of South Korea's new president, Moon Jae-in, has given fresh hope of a thawing in relations with China, which have recently been strained due to the deployment of a controversial missile defence system in South Korea.
Chinese leader Xi Jinping called Moon Thursday to congratulate him for his electoral victory. During the 40-minute call, Xi stressed the importance of working together to achieve the common goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula - an aim dependent on resolving the thorny THAAD missile defence system issue.
Moon, a liberal who favours dialogue with North Korea,wonSouth Korea's elections on Wednesday, replacingimpeached President Park Geun-hye.
Tong Zhao, an associate fellow at the Carnegie Tsinghua Center for Global Policy, said while the two nations share a similar agenda, the THAAD issue is the number one problem between them.
Zhao said though the tone of the call showed progress, there were no real specifics at play and there's still a lot of uncertainty regarding how the two nations will move past the issue.
"I still believe Moon Jae-in faces major difficulties in reversing the THAAD deployment, or even making any kind of modifications," Zhao says.
In a press conference after the call, South Korea's chief of presidential public affairs, Yoon Young Chan, said South Korea is "well aware" of China's interest and concerns over THAAD, adding that Moon expressed a wish during his conversation with Xi for bilateral communication about the issue "as soon as possible."
Denuclearization
Xi during the call, also expressed China's commitment to achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through "dialogue," a statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said.
"This is in the common interest of China and South Korea as well as overall peace and stability in the region," Xi said, according to the statement.
According to Zhao, China's understanding on how to deal with North Korea is very much in line with the new South Korean president. First freeze North Korea's nuclear development, then engage with them economically before before working towards the ultimate goal of denuclearization.
"The new South Korean government will actively communicate with China on these issues and seek appropriate resolutions," the statement quoted Moon as saying.
"It's much more likely now that they can work together," says Zhao.
Feeling the pinch
Beijing's displeasure over THAAD has reportedly been felt by South Korean businesses, particularly Lotte, the South Korean conglomerate that signed off on a land swap deal with the government to provide a site for the THAAD launch systems in late February.
During the call, Moon told Xi that South Korean people and companies in China "are going through many difficulties," and said he hoped Xi could "pay special attention so the restrictions and sanctions could be smoothly resolved," Yoon said.
The South Korean government said last week it believed Chinese authorities had told travel agencies in Beijing to stop selling trips to South Korea, intensifying fears of a trade war between the neighbors.
The Chinese government, however, denied any knowledge of such an order.
China is South Korea's largest trading partner, with the latter exporting up to $142 billion each year to the country.

International Vesak Day Sri Lankas Contribution

Prof. G.P. Malalasekera
(8th November 1899  23rd April 1973)
Prof. Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera initiated and inspired a meeting of global Buddhists in 1950 CE (Buddhist Era 2493) in Sri Lanka resulting in the inauguration of the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) on the 25th May 1950 (2493BE) at the Temple of Tooth Relic in Kandy. This meeting was attended by 129 Buddhist delegates from 27 countries in Asia, Europe and America. At this meeting the Buddhist Flag was formally accepted and Ven. Piyaratana Thero recommended that Vesak Day should be accepted globally as a Buddhist celebration, a proposal which was accepted and followed by the Global Buddhist Fraternity. Buddhism during its existence over two millennia had developed into 3 schools  Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana, all disciples and believers of the Sakyamuni Buddha. Prof. G.P. Malalasekera could unite all three schools of Buddhism within the World Fellowship of Buddhism and became the first president of WFB from 1950 to 1958.
Lakshman Kadirgamar
(12th April 1932  12th August 2005)
Lakshman Kadirgamar, former Minister of Foreign Affairs tabled a proposal at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in 1999 requesting for the adaptation of Vesak Day on 23rd September 1999 and at the 79th Plenary Meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on 15th December 1999 this resolution was discussed as the Agenda Item 174 which was sponsored by Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Chile, Cyprus, Greece, Grenada, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iceland, Lao Peoples Democratic Republic, Lesotho, Maldives, Mauritius, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nepal, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Philippines, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Russian Federation, Seychelles, Slovakia, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United States.

JO will gain power in NCP: Chandrasena
Former Minister S. M. Chandrasena yesterday said that the Joint Opposition(JO) will gain power in the North Central Provincial Council in the next couple of weeks.
Addressing the media at his residence in Anuradhapura yesterday, Chandrasena said the removal of North Central Province Health Minister K.H Nandasena has created another crisis within the provincial council.
Following the removal of K.H Nandasena, former Chief Minister S.M Ranjith Samarakoon has resigned from his post.Several other Ministers will also decide their future course of action soon,he said.
During a discussion held between the SLFP and JO Provincial Council members recently, MP Chandrasena had stressed that the members should act independently.
The members have emphasised the need to appoint a new Chief Minister for the Provincial Council.
MP Chandrasena said that a Chief Minister should be accepted by the majority in the council.
According to the Constitution, a person accepted by the majority can only be appointed as Chief Minister or Member of Parliament. In many situations, the good governance government has been acting against the values of democracy,he alleged.
He further said if the government fails to give the Chief Ministers post as expected by the majority in the council, they would abolish the Provincial council and take the democratic power in their hands.
We would resort to action in another one week. All the Provincial council members requested that we need the Chief Ministers post, he said.
He further said that they have not yet decided who is going to be the Chief Minister and added that they would come to a decision after discussions with all the members.
The problem is not with the individual but the Chief Minsiter who should be accepted by the majority, he said.

Lankan couple caught in immigration  law limbo launches appeal
Taxi driver Nisreen Ahamed Mohamed Nilam fled Sri Lanka almost a decade ago and successfully claimed refugee status, but hes still waiting to become a full Canadian citizen because his case is snarled in a changes to immigration policy.
Nilam, 36, came to Vancouver during a raging civil war in his home country in 2008.
His lawyer says he followed the rules when he made two return trips home, but now that Canadas immigration laws have changed, hes caught in a legal limbo.
Hes a law-abiding refugee who is now being told to get lost, said Doug Cannon, who has filed for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, questioning whether or not refugees are equal to other immigrants.
The case could affect hundreds of other refugees impacted by legislative changes made by the Conservative government in 2012.
Those changes allow the government to revoke permanent residency status for settled refugees, if the person travels back to their home country, uses their old passport or applies for a new passport.
The rules are based on the fact that a refugee fleeing from a dangerous situation needs Canadas protection and cant return to their home.
Nilam fled fearing the persecution of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, flying to the US and crossing into BC on foot near the Peace Arch border crossing in 2008.
He says that when the civil war was over three years later, he returned home twice to visit his ailing mother and then to get married.
When he returned from his trip with his new wife, they dreamed of starting a family in Vancouver.
Border guards offered them good wishes as they entered Canada.
But in the meantime, changes to the law allowed officials to reopen asylum files.
Then Immigration Minister Jason Kenny promised this would help catch frauds and fakes.
But immigration experts say instead cessation applications create fear and clog the refugee hearing system.
Cannon says the focus on pushing people out suggests refugees really are just opportunists, or they are a constant burden on our society, and we should get rid of as many as we can.
Like that kind of stuff is just nonsense.
Nilam only learned he was being flagged for his earlier trips home after writing his citizenship tests in 2015 and awaiting word of the date for his swearing-in ceremony.
Cannon says immigration officials secretly set Nilams file aside.
When he came to me, he was baffled, said Cannon, describing his clients shock at being barred from citizenship.
Nilams wife, Fathima, 30, has obtained permanent residency status  but Nilam may now be deported, despite living in Vancouver, working as a taxi driver, paying taxes like a model citizen, says his lawyer.
Absurd law
New Democrat MP Jenny Kwan says the campaign to oust Nilam is ridiculous.
She says the cessation laws need to change, with 293 refugees stalled by this process as of late 2016.
This is an absurd law - lets get on with it, said Kwan.
Refugee Rights watchers say the majority of cases under the amended laws come out of B.C., driven by an aggressive Canada Border Service Agency team, in the wake of the arrival of the MV Sun Sea in 2010, when about 490 Tamil migrants arrived on the ship seeking refugee status.
Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, says, while cessation rules are common worldwide, Canadas version is flawed.-

Message from the United Nations Secretary-General

I send my warmest wishes to all those celebrating the Day of Vesak in honour of the birth of Lord Buddha. Everyone can draw inspiration from his journey. Born a sheltered prince, Shakyamuni went out into the world to confront and overcome human suffering. As one sutra states, Because all living beings are subject to illness, I am ill as well.
This message of compassion is timeless. In our interconnected world, there can be no peace as long as others are in peril; no security as long as others suffers deprivation; no sustainable future until all members of our human family enjoys their human rights. On this Day of Vesak, let us celebrate the wisdom of Lord Buddha by taking action for others with a strong spirit of solidarity.

Pakistan makes solid start in third Test
DOMINICA : An unbeaten 85 by Azhar Ali and 55 from Babar Azam put Pakistan in a solid position at 169 for two at stumps on a rain-shortened first day of the third and final Test against the West Indies at Windsor Park in Dominica on Wednesday.
Fresh from a workman-like first innings century despite defeat in the second Test, Ali was again a model of composure in progressing towards another significant innings after over five hours at the crease during which he faced 219 deliveries, stroking two sixes and seven fours.
His confidence dented after enduring the indignity of a "pair" in that loss in Barbados, Azam was less assured at the start of his innings and needed a generous slice of luck to get to his second half-century of the series. Leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo should have claimed his wicket but the right-hander, on 28, was badly missed by wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich just as play resumed in the early afternoon following the first of two stoppages for a steady, persistent drizzle.
That lapse added to the increasing list of costly errors in the field for the West Indies during this 2017 international season in the Caribbean as the pair extended their second-wicket partnership to 120 when Azam eventually departed in a long final session, offering a simple catch to Kieran Powell at first slip off Alzarri Joseph.
Younis Khan, who together with captain Misbah ul Haq is playing his farewell Test, will resume in partnership with Ali on the second morning, weather permitting.
Further compounding the home side's woes after Jason Holder won the toss and chose to bowl first in heavily overcast conditions was the lack of potency of his prime opening bowler, Shannon Gabriel.
Although economical, Gabriel could not recapture the hostility that wrecked Pakistan's second innings on the final day of the second Test in Barbados.
Sharing the new ball with Gabriel, Joseph was completely out of sorts in his first spell, prompting the introduction of Roston Chase's off-spin within the first hour's play.
That resulted in the visitors' only casualty of the morning. Shan Masood, playing his first match of the series in place of the unwell Ahmed Shehzad, reached nine off 30 deliveries and prodded indecisively at a delivery from Chase for Holder to take the straightforward catch at second slip.
Apart from the recall of Masood, Hasan Ali is making his debut at the expense of leg-spinner Shadab Khan, who struggled in his first appearance in the second Test.
Pakistan have never won a Test series in the Caribbean on seven previous tours while the West Indies are seeking a first Test series triumph in five years against a team ranked higher than themselves.

Real survive early Atletico onslaught to reach final
MADRID: Real Madrid survived an early Atletico Madrid onslaught to reach the Champions League final 4-2 on aggregate on Wednesday and set up a mouth-watering clash against Juventus.
Atletico roared into a two-goal lead in the semi-final second leg with a Saul Niguez header and Antoine Griezmanns penalty, but Isco notched in the 42nd minute for Real who saw out the game calmly to lose 2-1 on the night and ease into the final. Real, who won the first leg at home 3-0, have now eliminated Atletico from the competition in four consecutive seasons, including the 2014 and 2016 finals.
Zinedine Zidanes side can become the first team to retain the Champions League title when they face his former club Juventus in the final in Cardiff on June 3.
Its special, for sure, (Juventus) gave me everything, Zidane told reporters. But Im with Real Madrid, another club of my life. It will be a beautiful final.
Atletico's final European game at the Vicente Calderon before they move stadiums will be remembered for the fantastic atmosphere the supporters created as they tried to help their team overcome their arch-rivals. But Simeones men could not break their European curse against Real.
The first 20 minutes of this magic night at the Calderon will be remembered forever, the Atletico coach said. "We have to be proud of the players. They kept hope, showing we werent talking for the sake of talking but because we believed.
Driven on by the deafening Calderon, Atletico started well, creating more danger in the opening minutes than they managed in the entire first leg before Saul nodded home Kokes corner in the 12th minute.
When Raphael Varane brought down Fernando Torres four minutes later and Antoine Griezmann converted the penalty, the comeback seemed a real possibility.
But Real, who last failed to score 61 games ago, were not to be denied. Karim Benzemas sensational solo dribble on the left byline took out three Atletico defenders and he cut the ball back for Toni Kroos to drive a shot at goal.
Jan Oblak made an excellent save to keep the German at bay but Isco was on hand to poke home from close range and give Real a precious away goal.
Atletico continued to press but Navas pulled off a fine double save to deny Yannick Carrasco and Kevin Gameiro. Cristiano Ronaldo thought he had added a second for Real but it was harshly ruled out for offside and the visitors calmly kept possession in the closing minutes to stay on course for a 12th European Cup.

Royal London One-Day Cup: Jeevan Mendis cameo helps Derbyshire to win
Jeevan Mendis' excellent cameo right at the death helped Derbyshire seal a thrilling four-wicket victory over Warwickshire in their North Group Royal London One-Day Cup match played at Derby on Wednesday.
Mendis arrived at the crease with his side needing 58 off 39 deliveries with five wickets in hand while chasing 293. He then blasted 44 off just 23 balls as Derbyshire crossed the line with just two balls left in the chase. Openers Ben Slater and Billy Godleman set up the win with an 86-run partnership for the first wicket with the former going on to score 82.
In another match Gary Ballance smashed a 118-ball 152 before an all-round effort from the Yorkshire bowlers helped the visitors rise to the top of the North Group points table at Northampton. Asked to bat first, Yorkshire had a shaky start, that saw Adam Lyth (2), Joe Root (7) and Peter Handscomb (9) fall cheaply. Jonny Bairstow too didn't convert a good start, leaving Yorkshire on 73 for 4 in the 18th over. Ballance and Matthew Waite (43) added 105 runs off 121 balls, before the late flourish took the team to 300. Ballance, who smashed 19 fours and 3 sixes in his innings, added 121 runs in the last 12 overs with Adil Rashid (41 n.o. off 35 balls). In reply, Northamptonshire were bundled out for 136 in the 29th over. With this defeat, Northamptonshire are out of the tournament. An excellent century by Dane Vilas coupled with an all-round effort by Jordan Clark helped Lancashire register a thumping win over Worcestershire by 152 runs at Old Trafford in Manchester. Even though Lancashire lost half their side in the 32nd over while batting first, Vilas and Clark added 160 off just 113 balls with the former reaching a ton off 83 balls. Clark also remained unbeaten at the other end on 79 as Lancashire went past the 300-run mark.
Chris Liddle's magnificent spell in the middle overs helped Gloucestershire pull things back and register a narrow 11-run win over Kent at Bristol. At one stage Kent were cruising at 200 for 2 while chasing 276 but Liddle, who had already remove Joe Denly, managed to get rid of Daniel Bell-Drummond for 90. The hosts seized upon that opportunity to strike at regular intervals to completely overturn the momentum. Liddle went on to finish with a five-wicket haul.
Glamorgan wasted a fine start to eventually wilt in their run chase and lose by 16 runs to Middlesex in Radlett.
Rilee Rossouw's blistering ton helped Hampshire make light work of the 250-run target set by Somerset. Rossouw lit up Taunton with an 113-ball 156 that consisted of 24 fours and two sixes. Even though wickets kept falling at the other end, Rossouw ensured that Hampshire kept pace with the asking rate. Eventually, they won with 76 balls to spare.
Sussex's decision to bowl first worked wonders when Jerome Taylor stunned Essex with a hat-trick in the fifth over of the game. Varun Chopra, Tom Westley and Adam Wheater fell off consecutive deliveries to leave Sussex in a spot of bother but the seasoned Alastair Cook brought his expertise into play with a masterful ton. Cooks 109 included 12 fours and Ten Doeschate's 91-ball 102 ensured that his side finished with 295 for 7 - a total that seemed impossible when Essex were tottering at 19 for 3 in the fifth over.

RTC's historic  Governors Cup and Queens Cup Races
Deepthika Jayakody bagged it all as her horses dominated to win both prestigious races, the Governor's Cup and Queen's Cup when the Royal Turf Club (RTC) April 29 race day came to an end at the scenic Nuwara Eliya racing track.
The legendary horse Alcazaba rode by the Indian ace jockey Y.S. Srinath won Deepthika the top title of the day, the Governor's Cup, which she won back-to-back while Captain Haddock rode by jockey Irvan Singh won her the Queen's Cup.
The governor's Cup is considered as the Sri Lankas version of the Kentucky Derby in USA, Ascot Gold Cup in the UK, de l'Arc de Triomphe in France and the Turnbull Stakes in Australia.
The 2017 races made history when the Board of Stewards of the Royal Turf Club, opened the Governors cup, which was limited only to Class 1 horses and the Queens Cup which was limited only to Class 2 horses, to all horses of all classes without any restrictions, for the first time ever in over a hundred years. This historic decision was made on April 23 provided an equal opportunity to all horses and all owners to compete and win these two prestigious races on the 29th.
The day was opened by the 1070-meter Class 5 race, the HNB Grameen Cup, which was won by Krabi who jumped out and decided to play the waiting game, finally passing Augusta and Blazing Berry to confirm an astounding victory with a 3 length lead. Coming back to racing only in 2016 after RTC took over the race course, Owner Dhanawardene Guruge was to savour the sweet taste of victory after 2 decades.
Local Jockey Punithraj on his mount Vigorous, prevailed over Indian Ace Y S Srinath, in the 1070 Meter Hi Magazine Cup, beating both Stormont ridden by Y S Srinath and the usual contender Torpedo, proving the metal of Local riders and the excellence of the training provided by Sinclair Marshall, Deputy CEO, who is also the founder and Principle of Sri Lankas first ever Jockey training school. Owned by one of the oldest Horse owners Ajantha De Soyza of Monaro Stables, the 7-year-old Brown mare out of Lucifer Sam (USA) and Taxido proved that she is the better horse in no uncertain terms.
This was followed by the most exciting race of the day, when the 6-year-old Brown Mare Stormy Petrel, ridden by Ravi Kumar and trained by Madialagan, went in to almost a blanket finish with back to back winner Honorius was defeated by less than a neck in the Class 5, 1400 meter Blackpool Hotel Cup. Owned by Anjali Stables, Stormy Petrel proved that she is a horse to be watched out for.
Excitement mounted, as it has been for the last 97years, when the horses came out to the Paddock to run the Queens Cup 2017. The race was open to all horses, first time since the inception of the race in 1920. In the paddocks were Governors cup 2016 winner Roswald owned by Deepthika Jayakody, and Meheran owned by Hasanga Jayaratne who won the RTC Magic Millions in a major upset just 2 weeks before, beating legendary Alcazaba by a neck. Anura Delgodas response to the challenge Celestial Fire was among others. Arabian Gold owned by Mr. and Mrs. Rienzie Edwards also a serial winner of the Queens Cup had to be withdrawn at the last minute due to Veterinary grounds.
Initially Celestial Fire took the lead and beat Meheran convincingly with a half a length lead when Jockey Irvan Singh on Captain Haddock, owned by Deepthika Jayakody made short work of the race beating Celestial Fire by 1  Lengths and Meheran by a massive 2 lengths. In his first Major win in Sri Lanka, the 5-year-old dark brown horse out of Admiral of the Fleet (USA) and Belladee (IRE) who had won 6 Stakes in the 9 races he had run in India, emerged a force to reckon with in Sri Lanka as well.
Excitement and anticipation reached a peak on the course as the horses lined up for the Governors Cup 2017. The lineup saw a variety of horses from different classes due to the Board of Stewards opening this race to all horses for the first time in 150 years. This most historic and the most prestigious race for every owner started under starters orders exactly at 12.20pm. The Queen of Nuwara Eliya, the legendary Alcazaba was ridden in the most brilliant ride ever given to her by the Indian ace Y.S. Srinath. Srinath maintained Alcazaba in the 5th position till the last 600 meters allowing Santos, Silver Streak, Charlemagne and Kingston Town to dictate terms. Alcazaba shot through in between Charlemagne and Silver Streak like a bullet around 200 meters and took over the running to win the Prestigious Governors Cup for the second time in line for Deepthika Jayakody.
In form horse Kingston Town, owned by Hasanga Jayaratne, was showing lot of promise but he too had no answer for the Queen of Nuwara Eliya Alcazaba nor to the class 1 horse silver streak who finished 4 lengths behind the Queen of Nuwara Eliya. Finally, Kingston Town managed only to beat the pacemaker of the race Santos in the last 50 meters to gain the fourth position.
Renowned Fashion Designer Deepthika Jayakodys Fashion show grabbed all the attention of the stylish audience. RTC Fashion Parade is all about elegance, so the April 29 race day wear collection was inspired by the horse racing elements combined with elegance,' said Deepthika.
The chief guest, Highways and Higher Education minister Lakshman Kiriella and guest of honour Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayaka presented the Governor's Cup while the Deputy British High Commissioner Laura Davis handed over the Queen's Cup to winners.
Another Governors Cup race day finally drew to a close with Glittering ridden by Irvan Singh and owned by Mr. and Mrs. Rienzie Edwards winning the 1400-meter Highway and Higher Education Ministry Cup for Class 3 horses and Eye Touch ridden by A Dilan, winning the 1000-meter Pony Welfare Raffle Cup for  bred horses.
The next race dates for 2017 are billed to be August 6, September 2, November 4 and December 2.

Captain Haddock owned by Deepthika Jayakody, rode by Y.S.Srinath and trained by S.P.A.Raju winning the Queen's Cup race.

Significance of Vesak Festival
Vesak (Sinhalese), Vesakha (Pali), Vaisakha (Sanskrit) is the name used for the 2nd month in Sri Lankan traditional Moon calendar (Lunar calendar) which corresponds with the month of May in the Gregorian calendar (Solar calendar).
It was on the full moon day in the month of Vesak, Prince Siddharta was born, became enlightened and attained Mahaparinibbana. The full moon day of Vesak is celebrated by Buddhists honouring these three important occasions of the life of the Buddha.
The significance of Vesak lies with the Buddhas teaching of cessation of suffering and universal peace to all humankind. It is a message to urge followers to do that which is good and to turn away from evil. It is a message of peace and perfect harmony between human beings and nature.
Vesak is associated with three important locations of Buddhist history  Lumbini in Nepal, the birth place of Prince Siddharta, Bodh Gaya (Buddha Gaya) Bihar State in India where The Buddha attained the most exalted Enlightenment under a Bodhi Tree and Kushinagar (Kusinara) in Uttar Pradesh, India where The Buddha attained Mahaparinibbana.
These three incidents in the life of Buddha is known in Sri Lanka as Themagula or the three Buddhist auspicious events  Birth, Enlightenment and Mahaparinibbana of The Buddha and celebrated in large scale in Sri Lanka and other Buddhist countries.
The United Nations General Assembly accepted the importance of Vesak and in 1999 by its resolution 54/115 acknowledged that Buddhism as one of the oldest religions in the world contributing to the spirituality of humanity for over two and half millennia and is commemorated annually at the United Nations Headquarters and UN Offices.
In 2017, United Nations International Day of Vesak will be hosted by Sri Lanka under the theme Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace. The events include an International Buddhist Symposium the participation of over 400 delegates from 100 countries.
Celebrating Vesak
Vesak is celebrated as a Buddhist event in many Buddhist countries. In Sri Lanka, Vesak is celebrated on the full moon day in the month of Vesak and it is a two-day national holiday. The celebrations include religious activities such as observing the 8 percepts, listening to religious discussions, meditations, religious rituals in temples, etc. All Buddhists visit the temple dressed in white and make offerings of flowers, light and incense. Temple bells herald the times of rituals and all temples are filled with devotees.
During Vesak all Buddhist homes, public space, temples, etc., are illuminated with lanterns, lamps, Pandals (illuminated picture stories) of the life of Buddha and Jataka stories, etc., are created all over the island. Religious groups, neighbourhood groups, associations and societies provide Free Alms (Dansel) to people. These Free Alms include lunch, dinner, snacks, drinks, ice creams, and various other food types and offered to people. The night of the full moon day in the month of Vesak and the following day people travel to enjoy the lanterns, pandals and other Buddhist creative arts.
Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace
In the modern chaotic world, the discussion of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace is a timely topic not only for the Buddhist World but for the World at large. The multi-cultural, multi-lingual, multi-ethnic world of today, people are floundering in search of personal and universal peace and the Buddhist world view is relevant today as it was 2,600 years ago  all people are equal. The Metta Sutta of the Pali Canon explains the Buddhist concept of society, in the deepest ethical sense, includes all living things of the world  humans, fauna and flora. The Vasettha Sutta states that mankind is biologically the same and divisions in human society are mere conventional classifications. It further clarifies that it is a persons spiritual advancement which defines him or her as a high human being or a low human being and not birth. The Kanhakatthala Sutta states that when people are given equal opportunities irrespective of their caste, creed or other social parameters, they will perform equally well.
The Noble Eight-Fold Path (Right Thought, Right Concentration, Right Mindfulness, Right Vision, Right Livelihood, Right Speech, Right Action and Right Effort) is not only the path to emancipation from Suffering but sets out all important guidelines for every aspect of human conduct. It can be considered as one of the most comprehensive codes of human conduct to be compiled. These guidelines cover every aspect of human behavior, both short term and long term will prevail to bring Social Justice and World Peace.
In 2017, Sri Lanka is hosting the United Nations Vesak Day with the theme of Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace through the teachings of the Buddha.

Strays  unwanted
The number of stray dogs within the Sri Jayawardenapura University had got out of hand and in order to deal with the issue, the university authorities on April 8 and 9, contracted the company Ultra Kill to either kill or dump the 30 dogs which roamed the university at a different location. This measure taken by the University to control the dog menace raised many a protest among the general public and animal welfare activists even resorted to a vigil in support of the dogs.
The university however, is not alone in taking measures into its own hands and the lack of action taken by the authorities to deal with the stray dog population in the country has led to many resorting to such action.
The task of dealing with the dog menace comes under the purview of the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Faiszer Mustapha and in early 2016 he put forward a Cabinet paper with a plan to curb the crisis caused by stray dogs. He had also proposed that the anti-rabies vaccination programme and the sterilization programme be amalgamated. The implementation of this proposal however has seen several hurdles.
Initiatives taken to lessen the menace
In March this year, Minister Mustapha proposed that if a registered dog (a dog with an owner) was found to be straying, the owner was liable to a fine of up to Rs 25,000 and two years imprisonment. Cabinet approved this proposal and agreed to amend the Registration of Dogs Ordinance No 51 of 1901 to implement the proposal.
N. Madhusanka from Dehiwala meanwhile claimed that the proposed amendment to the Dog Registration Ordinance would lead to mass killing of dogs as people would resort to kill dogs in order to avoid paying fines.
Despite such worries, activists say that the Dog Registration Act needs to be amended.
The Dog Registration Act has to be amended and we have also proposed to establish Dog shelters to deal with the dogs that are a menace to the public. The Minister has also agreed to provide a land for such a place but we are yet to receive Cabinet approval for that, said Kandy Association for community Protection through Animal Welfare (KACPAW) Secretary Champa Fernando, who is a member of the Advisory Committee appointed by Minister Mustapha to provide a long term solution to manage the stray dogs menace.
Animal welfare organizations have shown keen interest in the stray dog issue and many over the years have worked closely with the government to introduce an extensive programme for vaccination and sterilization.
The organizations have stressed throughout that the solution to the problem lay in an effective sterilization programme while finding shelters for problematic dogs. These programmes though accepted by the government, have seen very little success when it comes to implementation and this issue becomes even more complicated when multiple departments and ministries get involved in the implementation process.
One such case was when a Cabinet decision was taken in 2016 to have the Rabies Eradication and Dog Sterilization programme handled by the Department of Animal Production and Health (DAPH) from 2017 onwards under one health concept.
Fernando however, alleged that these twin programmes were still being handled by the Ministry of Health and was not handed over to the DAPH to carry out the work.

All zoonotic diseases are handled by DAPH but rabies even though it is a zoonotic disease, is handled by the Health ministry. The Ministrys Public Health and Veterinary Services Unit is handling the eradication of rabies and human vaccination, she said.
Acting Director, Public Health and Veterinary Services Unit, Dr Ruwini Pimburage responded that discussions were still taking place on the handover of both the Rabies Eradication and Dog Sterilization programmes to the DAPH.
She explained that the handover was complicated as the Dog Sterilization Programme was done with the assistance of district and regional health officials, local government health officials along with regional epidemiology unit officials.
Rabies statistics
Dr Pimburage in the meantime, saw irresponsible pet ownership as the main cause for the rise in Rabies. While there are concerns over the rise in dog population which may be adding to an increase in cases of rabies, Colombo National Hospital Deputy Director Dr. Cyril de Silva said he could not confirm that Rabies was on the rise and said that he had to go through the data to comment on it.
The patients who come to hospital are not only as a result of dog bites. Rabies cases are reported for cats, squirrels and other animal bites as well, he said.
A senior official of the Health Ministry who wished to remain anonymous said that around 30,000 people were treated for rabies at the National Hospital alone last year.
The government is spending a huge amount of money to treat the victims. But, comparatively very fewer measures are being taken to prevent it, he said.
According to the health ministry data, seven deaths have been reported in the last four months while there were 20 deaths from rabies last year.
He further said that Gampaha and Galle districts have recorded the highest number of rabies cases.
The official meanwhile, said that reports of dog bites have risen to a record level of nearly 1,200 every day and added that among the rabies cases that are reported, 90 percent are as a result of dog bites.
He emphasized that as very fewer measures are taken by the relevant authorities to deal with the dog menace, sometimes people are forced to deal with it on their own. The consequences might lead to greater confusion similar to what happened at the Jayawardenepura University.
People cannot fully blame the Vice Chancellor, there would have been problems. There are many incidents where some people kill the dogs but they are not revealed to the outer world. The relevant authorities should take the whole issue in their hands to curb the crisis, he said.
Despite several attempts made by the Daily News to contact Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha, he was not available for a comment.
Yet, the Minister on several occasions previously had assured that the intention of the amendment is to stop people from dumping animals in public places and to make them more concerned about animals.
Fewer initiatives  Matters taken into their own hands
As the sterilization programme struggles to have an impact on the dog population, the disappearance of dogs from the Sri Jayawardenapura University premises has taken the dog issue to a different level, said Fernando.
Vice Chancellor of the Sri Jayawardenapura University was recently blamed for killing/ dumping the dogs with the help of a contracted company called Ultra Kill.
If the dogs are a real issue there are measures to deal with that, killing them is not the right decision. But, the Vice chancellor had said that he wanted the dogs to be removed not killed. Ultra kill is registered under the banner Pesticides and they are not for sterilization of dogs, she explained.
She further stressed that a survey needs to be done to check on the amount of the dogs in that area.
The Vice Chancellor of the University was not available for comment despite several attempts made by the Daily News to contact him.
What needs to be done
Fernando said that the Health Ministry in 2008, initiated the National Dog sterilization programme using the model that KACPAW provided.
Since 2008, more than one million dogs have been sterilized free of charge through the Health Ministry. It has helped to reduce the dog population as well as the cost of dog rabies and human rabies vaccinations, she explained.
She urged the authorities to engage veterinarians using the DAPHs organizational structure that would spread across the country.
Fernando noted that there are 328 DAPH Veterinary surgeons divisions in each of the nine provinces, covering the 25 districts.
She said that if the programme was not taken island wide, it would be impossible to see a long term solution to the problem.
It would be very easy for the pet owners across the country to get their dogs sterilized and vaccinated in their own home area, once the necessary manpower and resources are given to all 328 Veterinary surgeons divisions, she said.
Fernando however said that setting up of island wide DAPH Public Health Veterinary Units is not going to be an easy task.
As it is going to be a hard task that would take few years to fully establish them, we urge the Health Ministry to continue dog sterilizations through their MOH offices. And DAPH Public Health Veterinary Units will function around the country to prevent and eradicate rabies while providing dogs as well as human rabies vaccinations, she said.
Fernando warned that even a temporary stopping of the sterilization programme could result in the dog population growing again.
She said that the Wayamba veterinary surgeons in the South submitted proposals for a pilot project in their area but they were not given money to commence the project.
The Health Ministry is stopping this for some reason. They dont realize the need for more veterinary surgeons. Rabies eradication and dog sterilization has to go hand in hand, she added.
Dr. Pimburage in the meantime insisted that there are enough veterinary doctors in Sri Lanka and they were able to carry out the programme without any issues.
Preventing Rabies
She noted that their main focus was on preventing Rabies.
If the dogs are a problem to the public, they should inform the Municipal Councils or the Pradeshiya Sabhas. They have the authority to deal with that. The Health Ministrys responsibility is to sterilize dogs, vaccinate people and deal with dog bite victims, she said.
She alleged that People easily leave puppies on the roads failing to realize the consequences of it.
They should make sure that they are well taken care of. Sterilization has to be done properly to the dogs. The public are also very careless about dealing with these problems, she said.
Fernando meanwhile, said that their only hope is the drafted proposal to tackle the issue that has become an issue in urban as well as suburban areas in the country.
Kelum Dharmaratne a three wheel driver from Borella said dogs were a never ending issue in the area.
We sometimes do not know whom to inform. Many residents have asked me whether I can help them to take these dogs and put them in a different area. I think this is a growing issue. Borella is a very congested and busy place. It is not easy for dogs to roam around and with their increase in number, its a real menace to people, he said.
At present it all lies in the hands of Minister Faiszer Mustapha who is yet to present the proposal on dealing with the stray dog population to Cabinet. It is expected that it would happen within the next two weeks.

Animal Welfare organizations state that the proposal had been formulated by the Ministry with the support of Animal Welfare organizations to bring the issue under control but things are at a standstill with the Ministry not willing to dig its teeth into the matter.

Supreme Court issues stay order on Court of Appeal decision to disqualify Geetha
The Supreme Court today issued an Interim Order until May 15, staying the operation of the judgment made by Court of Appeal which declared that Geetha Kumarasinghe disqualified as Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold this office.
However, President's Counsel J.C. Weliamuna appearing on behalf of two Galle district residents informed Court that his clients and other respondents were yet to receive notices and thereby raised objections for any hearing into matter.
Through an appeal petition, Galle District UPFA MP Geetha Kumarasinghe sought an order to set aside the judgment dated May 3, 2017 by Court of Appeal.
A three-judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne decided to fixed the matter for support on May 15 and directed the respondent-petitioner to serve notices on respondents before next support date.
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for MP Geetha Kumarasinghe moved Court that an interim order be issued staying the operation of judgment made by Court of Appeal since this application is a matter of urgent necessity.
President's Counsel J.C. Weliamuna informed Court that his clients were yet to receive notices regarding the appeal and said he had just appeared in Courts following newspaper publications that this matter was to be taken up for support on May 12.
"We are yet to receive notices regarding the appeal and expecting to raise preliminary objections. This petition should not be heard today because, the papers have not been served on the respondents. The Court should not be given any privileges to this petitioner and should allow to follow nomal procedure. This application should not be taken up for any consideration as it is still ex-parte case," Weliamuna added.
He further submitted to Court that the petitioner Geetha Kumarasinghe had committed an offence tantamount to contempt of court following the Court of Appeal order. "By ignoring the Court of Appeal order, she attended in parliament sessions and enjoyed the parliamentary privileges". Weliamuna further said.
Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara with Pulasthi Rupasinghe appearing for UPFA General Secretary raised objections for any hearing into matter including a stay order in the absence of respondents.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Janak de Silva appearing on behalf of the Secretary General of Parliament informed Court that he just received instructions to appear on behalf of Secretary General of Parliament.
The petitioner had sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgment made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 362/2015 by Court of Appeal. This petition will be taken up for support on May 12.
In this petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe had cited N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L. Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, the Secretary General of Parliament and several others as respondents.
Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by five residents of Galle district, the Court of Appeal on March 3 held that in terms of the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the constitution, the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship of both Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
The Court of Appeal had further directed the Attorney General to take necessary steps to formulate a mechanism to recover the expenses caused to state by Geetha Kumarasinghe while she was functioning as a Parliamentarian to sit and vote in Parliament.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka the qualifications of a Parliamentarian had been challenged through a writ petition over a dual citizenship issue.
The Court of Appeal maintained that a report submitted by the Department of Immigration and Emigration by August 2015 had confirmed that the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe was holding dual citizenship.

Treasury Bond Issue: CB Governor has authority to change decisions by MOC
The Central Bank Governor has the authority to change decisions taken by the Market Operations Committee (MOC) and the Tender Board, Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe yesterday said.
One main allegation against former Governor Arjun Mahendran was that he had taken decisions regarding the Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015, which were contrary to what the Market Operations Committee and the Tender Board recommended regarding the matter.
Dr. Weerasinghe was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Weerasinghe answered in affirmative when legal counsel Chanaka de Silva asked him if it is his position that a Governors approval is sufficient to carry on with the decisions taken by the Market Operations Committee (MOC).
Dr. Weerasinghe said a Governor had the authority to agree with or change a decision taken by the Market Operations Committee.
Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardena asked on the same note, could Dr. Weerasinghe say the same on the Tender Board, which is on a similar level of authority as the MOC does.
So, does the Governor, whoever he is, have the authority to change a recommendation made by the Tender Board Justice Jayawardena asked, to which Dr. Weerasinghe answered in affirmative.
The answers came into being when legal counsel Chanaka de Silva questioned the decision making process of the MOC when Ajit Nivard Cabraal was the Governor of the Central Bank.
De Silva suggested that the MOC prior to 2015 has held Repo auctions without the approval of the Governor, to which Dr. Weerasinghe disagreed. He said all the decisions taken by the MOC came under the scrutiny of Governor Cabraal, De Silva pointed out the decisions of the MOC were only sent to the Governor after holding the auctions and not before.
At the same proceedings, when the Attorney Generals panel was questioning Dr. Weerasinghe regarding the February 27, 2015 MOC meeting, DG Weerasinghe expressed his concerns on former Governor Arjun Mahendran single handedly taking the decision to remove the 5 percent penal rate, which is argued as a decision that supports an alleged fraud.Dr. Weerasinghe refused to accept a statement made under oath by DG Ananda Silva to the first COPE subcommittee inquired into the Treasury bond issue. Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando quoting DG Ananda Silva read out a potion of a statement where DG Ananda Silva says, All three of us took the decision to take the Rs.10.5 billion'.
Dr.Weerasinghe initially responding to the quote said DG Silva only mentions about a three individual and there is no names mentioned. Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardena pointed out it is very obvious according to the evidence given before the Commission, that the mentioned three individuals are former Governor Mahendran, DG Ananda Silva, and DG Nandalaal Weerasinghe.
Then, Dr. Weerasinghe said he does not agree with DG Ananda Silvas statement and that the former Governor gave a firm direction regarding taking Rs. 10.5 billion.

Treasury Bond Issue: CB Governor has authority to change MOC decisions
The Central Bank Governor has the authority to change decisions taken by the Market Operations Committee (MOC) and the Tender Board, Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe yesterday said.
One main allegation against former Governor Arjun Mahendran was that he had taken decisions regarding the Treasury bond issuance on February 27, 2015, which were contrary to what the Market Operations Committee and the Tender Board recommended regarding the matter.
Dr. Weerasinghe was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
Central Bank Deputy Governor Dr. Weerasinghe answered in affirmative when legal counsel Chanaka de Silva asked him if it is his position that a Governors approval is sufficient to carry on with the decisions taken by the Market Operations Committee (MOC).
Dr. Weerasinghe said a Governor had the authority to agree with or change a decision taken by the Market Operations Committee.
Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P. Jayawardena asked on the same note, could Dr. Weerasinghe say the same on the Tender Board, which is on a similar level of authority as the MOC does.
So, does the Governor, whoever he is, have the authority to change a recommendation made by the Tender Board Justice Jayawardena asked, to which Dr. Weerasinghe answered in affirmative.

Trump urges Russia  to rein in Syrian ally
US: President Donald Trump brushed aside concerns over his wooing of Russia on Wednesday and laid on a White House welcome for Moscows top diplomat to seek help to end the war in Syria.
As Washington reeled at the dismissal of FBI chief James Comey, who had been probing Russias alleged interference in the US election, a beaming Trump met Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
Lavrovs American counterpart Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has admitted that US-Russian relations are at their lowest ebb since the Cold War and that there is almost no trust left.
Diplomats are working to thaw ties by resolving small issues, which officials told AFP includes day-to-day battles such as US complaints that its officials posted to Russia are subjected to low level covert harassment.
But Trump remains hopeful that Putin can be convinced to help end the Syrian civil war by reining in Russias ally President Bashar al-Assad and his other key foreign backer -- Iran.
Trump emphasized his desire to build a better relationship between the United States and Russia, the White House said.
Lavrov is the highest-ranking Russian official to visit Washington since Trump came to power in January, and earned a rare invitation to the Oval Office for a head-to-head.
This followed a similar visit last month by Tillerson to Moscow, where he was received at the Kremlin by Putin.
Before visiting the White House, Lavrov and Tillerson huddled to discuss the crises in Syria and Ukraine -- talks qualified by the veteran Russian diplomat as constructive.
We had a very, very good meeting Trump said shortly after seeing Lavrov. Were going to stop the killing and the death.
Trump, the White House said, told Lavrov Moscow should rein in the Assad regime, Iran and Iranian proxies. Lavrov said he had sought support for a plan to create safe zones in Syria. As active players in the diplomatic process regarding Syria, we are going to pursue these contacts together and with other key countries, especially those in the region, Lavrov said. Lavrov, who last set foot in Washington in August 2013, dismissed all claims of election meddling as fabrications -- echoing Trumps claim that they amount to fake news. President Trump clearly confirmed his interest in building mutually beneficial, business-like pragmatic relations, he told journalists.
In Moscow, Putin met with his security council to discuss US-Russian relations in the context of Lavrovs meeting with Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Relations between the two former Cold War foes soured under former president Barack Obama over Russias 2014 annexation of Crimea and its unyielding support for Assad.
Since March 2011, the Syrian conflict has caused more than 320,000 deaths and forced millions of refugees to flee.
Neither Washington, which backs the opposition, nor Moscow, a longtime ally of the Syrian regime, have managed to find a solution to the conflict.
Since the end of Obamas presidency in January, the United States has gradually withdrawn from the diplomatic process, leaving Russia to take the lead.
The US was not part of a deal by Damascus backers Russia and Iran, and rebel supporter Turkey, signed Thursday in the Kazakh capital Astana on establishing safe zones in Syria.
The agreement calls for the creation of four de-escalation zones to shore up a ceasefire, ban flights and allow for humanitarian aid deliveries.
Washington gave the deal a skeptical welcome, rejecting Tehrans proposed role as a guarantor even as it expressed hope the agreement could set the stage for a later settlement. We will look at the proposal, see if it can work, Pentagon chief Jim Mattis said Monday.
Several ceasefires have been agreed on since Syrias conflict broke out, but they have failed to stem the fighting.
After the talks, Lavrov and Tillerson set off for Alaska and a meeting of the Arctic Council, a forum for cooperation on the environment, oil and mining, shipping, fisheries and tourism.

Of truths, half-truths and untruths
Truth is often bitter and painful. Our Ministers and other ruling politicians are kind enough to remind us about it quite often. However, they are the very same people who sang sweet truths to our ears during election time.
Be that as it may, one has to remember that truth is always relative and not absolute. There is always a gap between relative and absolute truth. What one person sees as truth may be an untruth to another, depending on his location or vision. For example, the moon is closer viewed from the Earth but would be far away to an inhabitant of Mars. Or to take an example in which logicians are obsessed with a door half closed is also half open. That is there is more than one way of expressing fact. This gives rise to half-truths or imperfect truths.
Our intention now is not to dwell on philosophy but to focus our attention on much more mundane affairs of politics and life. Let us focus, for example, on what is termed as transitional justice to the victims of the fratricidal war that raged in our country for almost three decades. There are several key issues that torment them, particularly the people in the North and East.
First, they want to know the fate of the missing persons. It includes not only those that went missing during the war but more particularly those sons and daughters whom their parents themselves handed over to the authorities in response to their call after the end of fighting. In fact it is an untruth to say that the latter category of persons is missing. In fact, the authorities who received them from their parents have a duty to say what happened to them, whether they are dead or alive If dead, how did they die If living, where are they now
Office of Missing Persons (OMP)
Though Parliament has approved the setting up of an Office of Missing Persons (OMP) it has so far being not established. The government is dragging its feet while bragging about its human rights record.
Or take the question of returning to the people lands in the North and East that are currently occupied by or in the possession of the Armed Forces. Here truths, half-truths and untruths are all in circulation. It is true that a considerable quantity of lands has been returned to their former legitimate owners but many remains to be done. They are mostly not government lands but private lands taken over during the time of the war. Many lands are not occupied by the Armed Forces but are either lying waste or are being cultivated by them. There is no call for the closure of security forces camps.
As far as the question of releasing political prisoners or those that are in detention without charges and those convicted in Courts promises have been made but no action has been taken. It is a tragedy to keep them imprisoned for years and years without an end while hard-core leaders of the LTTE have been released and some are receiving state political patronage.
Even after seven years those displaced persons are still in refugee camps while those re-settled also need basic facilities to start a decent living. Here again the return of lands to the former owners would provide them with a means of livelihood and rejuvenate the economy of the North and East. Incidentally, the authorities are yet to provide a solution to the displaced Muslims who were evicted from the Jaffna peninsula by the LTTE several decades ago. Procrastination has become the hallmark of politicians.
International community
The government is yet to honour its pledges to the international community and do justice to the victims of the war by the establishment of a Truth Commission despite loud pronouncements about instituting one. Perhaps it has got cold feet in face of position by chauvinist forces in the South. This may also be a reflection of similar chauvinist tendencies within the government itself. It is apparent that certain fringe political parties in it are trying to prevent progress towards a democratic solution to the national question by threats and blackmail.

This brings us to the vexed question of Constitutional reform.
The public seem confused as to what the intention of the government when a part of the government opposes fundamental reforms such as abolition of the executive presidency and another part supports a new Constitution.
Unless the government takes a firm decision on what it wants to do, whatever pronouncements by its leaders have to be taken as half-truths or untruths. It should actually have no ambiguity on this issue as they have pledged a new Constitution that includes a democratic solution to the national question at subsequent elections.
Transitional justice is not the sole issue. People have almost lost faith that the government would fully investigate and punish those responsible for bribery, corruption and misuse of public property. The ineffectiveness of the bodies created for the purpose and their financial strangulation by depriving them of funds and resources does not leave room for any optimism among the people. Discriminatory treatment of those alleged with such crimes also worries the public. Actually certain persons seem to be especially protected by the powers that be.
It is also not pleasant for this column too to repeat over and over again the same deficiencies of allegations against the government but in the context of what is happening it is forced to do so.
This situation could be overcome only by a united and concerted effort by the civil society. The government must also drop its paternalistic role and take people into confidence and learn from them in a spirit of humility.

UN Day of Vesak: Focus on Buddhas  timeless message
Vesak is a significant national event in Sri Lanka every year, but this year it has gained added impetus due to two main reasons: Sri Lanka is hosting the United Nations (UN) Day of Vesak celebrations for the first time (previous celebrations were held only in Thailand and Vietnam) and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Sri Lanka for the associated events. This is no doubt a great honour for Sri Lanka as all eyes in the Buddhist world and beyond will be on our island.
The UN has been celebrating Vesak officially since 1999. That year, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in which it recognized the International Day to acknowledge the contribution that Buddhism, one of the oldest religions in the world, has made for over two and a half millennia and continues to make to the spirituality of humanity. The credit for gaining greater recognition for Buddhism and Vesak within the UN should go to the late Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar who spearheaded a campaign for making Vesak a UN holiday. In this endeavour, he received the support of not only Buddhist countries but also other Member States of the UN.
Observing the Day of Vesak, United Nations Secretary General Antnio Guterres has called on the global community to draw inspiration from the journey of the Buddha and embrace his message of compassion. Guterres also emphasized that in today's interconnected world, there can be no peace as long as others are in peril, no security as long as others suffer deprivation [and] no sustainable future until all members of our human family enjoy their human rights. On this Day of Vesak, let us celebrate the wisdom of the Buddha by taking action for others with a strong spirit of solidarity. Buddhism is indeed an ideal antidote for a world driven apart by violence.
An ardent admirer of Buddhism
Indian PM Narendra Modi is a statesman who understands the power of Buddhism to heal the worlds wounds. An ardent admirer of Buddhism, Modi is well-known for his spiritual knowledge. It is most appropriate that a world leader of his calibre with a deep understanding of Buddhism is in Sri Lanka for the UN Day of Vesak events. Before departing for Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Modi greeted Buddhists around the world on the occasion of Buddha Purnima (as Vesak is known in India) saying that Gautama Buddha inspires us to work towards a harmonious society.Buddha Purnima greetings to everyone. Today we remember the exemplary ideals of Gautama Buddha. His noble thoughts will continue to guide generations, Modi said in a statement.

Prime Minister Modi has described the Buddha as a great reformer who gave humanity a new world view and Buddhists all over the world will be eagerly waiting to hear his address to the International Buddhist Conference to be held in Colombo to mark the UN Day of Vesak. In fact, the very theme of the UN Day of Vesak this year reflects Prime Minister Modis views on Buddhism: Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace. This will also be the main theme for the conference which will also include an address by President Maithripala Sirisena. Over 400 delegates from 100 countries are attending this very important conference.

The presence of the Indian Premier for these events is appropriate from another perspective. Although the Buddha was not born in what is now modern India (Lumbini in what is now Nepal was his birthplace), the Buddha lived much of his life (80 years) in India. He travelled the length and breadth of India disseminating the Dhamma and also came to neighbouring Sri Lanka on three occasions. The Buddhas Enlightenment and Passing Away occurred in India and these sites are venerated by Buddhists from all corners of the world. In fact, a large number of pilgrims from Sri Lanka visit India (and Nepal) every year to venerate the sacred sites where the Buddha once trod.
This is an appropriate moment to recall that one of the first tasks of Prime Minister Modi after his assumption of office was relaxing Indian Visa regulations for Sri Lankans visiting India on pilgrimages, business and leisure. Earlier, pilgrims had to wait for days to get a visa, now it is a matter of getting an e-visa.
Buddhism is Indias greatest gift to Sri Lanka. It was King Asoka, later known as Dharmasoka, who was instrumental in propagating Buddhism in the island more than 2,000 years ago. He sent his son Arahat Mahinda to Sri Lanka with the message of Buddhism, where he met King Devanampiyatissa, who embraced Buddhism. The rest, as they say, is history. The Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura and the Scared Tooth Relic of the Buddha, now enshrined at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy, were conveyed to Sri Lanka from India. Buddhism became the very foundation of our history, heritage and culture and it is the main thread that holds our social fabric together.
Buddhist revival in India
While Buddhism thrived and grew in Sri Lanka, only around five million people follow Buddhism in India at present. Hinduism, now the majority religion in India and Buddhism have influenced each other. Modi has spearheaded a Buddhist revival in India, seeking inspiration from two great Indians who were themselves ardent champions of the Buddhist way of life  Hindu philosopher Swami Vivekananda and the author of the Indian Constitution and Indias first Minister of Law and Justice Bhim Rao Ambedkar.
Swami Vivekanada had this to say about the Buddha: At the time Buddha was born, India was in need of a great spiritual leader, a prophet. Buddha never bowed down to anything, neither Veda, nor caste, nor priest, nor custom. He fearlessly reasoned so far as reason could take him. Such a fearless search for truth and such love for every living thing the world has never seen. Buddha was more brave and sincere than any teacher. Buddha was the first human being to give to this world a complete system of morality. He was good for good's sake, he loved for love's sake. Buddha was the great preacher of equality. Every man and woman has the same right to attain spirituality  that was his teaching I would personally call India Buddhist India as it has imbibed all the values and virtues of the teachings of Buddha by their religious scholars incorporating them in their literature.
Ambedkar, a Dalit (Untouchable) himself, rose against the caste system and saw Buddhism as the only way to create an equitable society. He converted to Buddhism along with 500,000 others in October 1956. The social movement he created led to a deeper understanding of Buddhism among Indians that resonates to this day. His book The Buddha and his Dhamma is a seminal work that all Buddhists should read. Last month, on the 126th Birth Anniversary of Ambedkar, Prime Minister Modi visited Deekshabhoomi, the sacred Buddhist monument where Ambedkar converted to Buddhism.
Ambedkars call for the inclusion of Buddhist values in everyday life and education will live on through the Nalanda University, which is being revived as a Buddhist centre of learning. India and Sri Lanka, along with other leading Buddhist nations must ensure that the Buddhas timeless legacy lives on throughout the world. The UN Day of Vesak has laid a firm foundation for this timely endeavour.

Winds of change in South Korea
South Korea has been going through a tumultuous period as a result of several political developments. South Koreans will hope that the worst will be behind them with the ushering in of their newly elected President Moon Jae-in (64). Moon ascended to the presidential seat due to a series of scandals that ousted his predecessor Park Geun Hye, the countrys first female President.
In the early autumn of last year, allegations surfaced that Park, a conservative and daughter of a former president, had used her influence as president to help a longtime friend named Choi Soon Sil acquire millions in ill-gotten donations from corporations.
Park was also beset by allegations that she had given Choi, someone with no known professional background or skills, access to classified government materials and had allowed Choi to dictate her governments decisions.
The allegations spurred the most spirited protest movement South Korea has seen in decades. Large crowds flooded public squares across the country week after week calling for Park to step down. Park was removed from office in December 2016 and formally impeached by the Constitutional Court in March. She is currently in detention awaiting trial on bribery charges. Elections were inevitable once the countrys top court upheld the impeachment.
This was the most direct scenario that led to the election of Moon. While Park is the daughter of a former president, Moon is the son of a labourer and a former soldier turned human rights lawyer. Moon has a personal connection with North Korea, where his parents originally lived before fleeing during the Korean War in the early 1950s. Hence Moon has not concealed his intentions to forge a better relationship with the belligerent neighbour and if possible, to pay a visit across the border. North Korea has sent shockwaves around the world after conducting a series of nuclear and missile tests. If Moon can meet and drive reason into his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong Un, that will be a major triumph. The unification of the two Koreas is one of Moons ultimate goals, though no one can give a time period as peace looks a distant possibility right now.
Moon will also have to follow a carefully balanced foreign policy that takes into account the countrys special security relationship with the United States, while also being friendly with China, the countrys biggest trading partner accounting for US$ 131 billion of South Korean exports last year alone. After all, Chinas support is also essential for any solution vis--vis North Korea.
South Koreans are now used to Kim Jong Uns sabre-rattling and North Korea was actually not a very big issue at the polls. But South Korea is beset by a whole raft of other problems that are not easy to resolve. Corruption remains a prime concern, because it is very difficult to separate the South Korean economy from the performance of its top conglomerates or Chaebols, nearly all of which have been embroiled in mega corruption scandals.
High unemployment among the youth is one of the most pressing problems. Here too, a sluggish economy precipitated by the less-than-stellar performance of Chaebols has led to zero growth in employment opportunities. Moon, who has promised to rein in the Chaebols, will have his work cut out in dealing with this problem.
Moon has also pledged to make governance more transparent and less bureaucratic. Even small gestures can make a big difference to voters tired of political fortresses  Moons offer to move the presidential office from an isolated compound nestled into the mountains in Seoul, to Gwanghwamun Square, the heart of civic life in the capital where protests against Park took place, appealed to younger voters. In fact, one of Moons priorities will be building trust with the Korean voters fed up with corruption and bureaucracy. Voters are eager to see the back of the corrupt and elitist corporate and political culture that has dominated the country for many years and Moons political survival may depend on delivering this promise.
Moon will want to project a new image of South Korea to the world after all the bad news. There is no doubt that the traditionally strong ties between Sri Lanka and South Korea would become stronger under Moon who is keen to move closer to the rest of Asia. South Korea is one of the few countries that allocate a quota of jobs to Sri Lankan youth. It recently abolished a surety bond requirement for Sri Lankans seeking jobs, which will be a great boon. The Sri Lankan Government should negotiate with South Korean authorities for more jobs. Bilateral trade between the two nations amounts to around US$ 500 million but there is much room for improvement. South Korea is also a leading investor and aid provider. People-to-people contact too has been improved after Korean Air began direct flights to Colombo. We hope that both sides would keep this momentum going and take the bilateral relationship to a new level under Presidents Maithripala Sirisena and Moon Jae In.
