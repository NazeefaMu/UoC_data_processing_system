Sri Lanka has special place in Indians hearts
Indias High Commissioner in Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu on Friday said Sri Lanka has a "special place" in the hearts of Indians and congratulated the Government of Sri Lanka on the completion of three years in office.
He was speaking at a largely attended function in India House to mark India's Republic Day.
It was on January 26, 1950, that India adopted a republican constitution and ceased to be a British Dominion. And it was on January 9, 2015, that a new government was established in Sri Lanka with Maithripala Sirisena as President and Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister following Sirisena's victory in the January 8, 2015 Sri Lankan Presidential election.
High Commissioner Sandhu recalled the exceptionally high level bilateral visits, including the landmark visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Sri Lanka in May 2017 and enumerated the many landmarks in bilateral relations witnessed over the last year.
These include: the expansion of India-assisted 1990 Emergency Ambulance Service nationwide; completion of nearly 46,000 houses in the war-affected Northern and Eastern provinces and the ongoing construction of 14,000 houses in the plantation areas of Central Sri Lanka; a fresh assistance of US$ 318 million to develop Sri Lanka's Railways; and the allotment of US$ 45 million to renovate the Kankesanturai harbour in Jaffna.
The High Commissioner said Indias total development assistance to Sri Lanka stands at US$ 2.76 billion, with over US$545 million as outright grants.
The High Commissioner and his officials paid homage to the fallen soldiers of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) at a solemn ceremony at the IPKF Memorial in Batttaramulla in the outskirts of Colombo.
To commemorate Indias 69th Republic Day a special cultural event christened Bollywood and Beyond was held at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall here on January 17. The event featured an enthralling performance by Indian violin wizard Dr. L. Subramaniam and the renowned Bollywood singer Kavita Krishnamurthy accompanied by eminent musicians.
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, a number of Ministers, Members of Parliament, senior officials and diplomats participated in the event.
The Consulates General of India in Jaffna and Hambantota and the Assistant High Commission of India in Kandy also celebrated the 69th Republic Day by hoisting the Indian National Flag on Friday.

Lose seven wickets for 31 before clinging on for victory in U19 Cricket World Cup
Sri Lanka win Plate
CHRISTCHURCH, Sunday : Something must have been in the Gatorade. It's the only explanation for what happened following the final drinks break of the day, when Sri Lanka almost lost the unlosable, only to finally reach victory in the last over in the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup Plate final played at the Bert Sutcliffe Oval, Christchurch on unday.
If the water bottles were tampered with, there was something in the mix for both teams. Both were responsible for the fluctuation, Sri Lanka inexplicably panicking, and West Indies finding their mislaid spirit. At the stoppage, Sri Lanka were 203/0, needing 52 from 84 balls. Hasitha Boyagoda had passed his hundred, Dhananjaya Lakshan was nearing one of his own, and the result seemed a formality. And then it happened. Boyagoda spooned to Jarion Hoyte to Nyeem Young at mid off. Nishan Madushka was run out, then Jehan Daniel, and then Lakshan, trying to reach his hundred with a boundary and relieve some pressure, was caught at mid off as well.
Sri Lanka under 19 cricketers rejoice winning the Plate final against West Indies. 
All of a sudden a stroll had turned into a contest, and it was only made closer when Bhaskar Yadram bowled a double wicket maiden, removing Kamindu Mendis and Ashen Bandara. Runs were coming, but slowly, and the game tightened again when with six to win, Nawanidu Fernando tried to finish it in one blow and was well caught on the boundary.
A chipped four to end the 49th over left Sri Lanka one to win, and seemed to have settled the matter. Three dot balls to start the 50th unsettled it. And then a rushed single, and jubilant celebrations, and the inevitable result finally transpired.
The finish is why the game will be remembered, but it was set up by a trio of special performances that deserve not to be forgotten in the maelstrom. Hasitha Boyagoda was exceptional, once again, playing an innings that was at least the equal of his record breaking 191 against Kenya. Scoring all round the ground, with an array of sweeps and scoops allowing him to find space behind the wicket, he seemed entirely at ease until he was dismissed. He must have thought with the game won he had licence. He couldn't have known. And he was ably supported by Dhananjaya Lakshan, who almost joined him on two hundreds for the tournament, rotating the strike and allowing his more aggressive partner to have his way, while also chipping in himself with 12 fours and a six.
Then there was Alick Athanazes wonderful unbeaten hundred, his second of the tournament, which held the West Indies innings together.
Sri Lankan captain Kamindu Mendis won the toss and chose to bowl, and might have initially been regretting his decision as West Indies openers added 50 within seven overs. Bhaskar Yadram was particularly severe, taking five early boundaries, and though all were struck firmly, each was kept along the ground, and it was only when he tried to take the aerial route that his downfall came, picking out Ashen Bandara at mid on. His dismissal initiated a slide of 10/3 as Sri Lanka turned the screws, especially through slow bowler Praveen Jayawickrama, who claimed the wickets of Yadram and Kimani Melius on his way to figures of 2/33.
But West Indies recovered through Alick Athanaze who played the situation to perfection, realising that a counter-attack wasnt on and instead nudging singles and rotating the strike, doing so regularly enough to ensure his strike rate didnt suffer.
He received stodgy support from Kirstan Kallicharan and Emmanuel Stewart and Brad Barnes, though all three struggled to score freely, tied down by accurate bowling and energetic fielding, and bothe were dismissed by excellent catches. Even towards the end Athanaze was still struggling to find the boundary, and his innings contained just seven in total, making the fact that he finished scoring at a run a ball all the more remarkable.
There have been more eye-catching innings, quicker innings, bigger innings at the ICC U19 CWC, but this was one of the most impressive of the lot, a batsman reining himself in against disciplined bowling, on a tricky pitch, and dragging his side to a total that seemed decent at the break, and then wholly inadequate when Boyagoda and Lakshan were batting. In the end, it wasn't quite enough.

The Russian Centre in Colombo will present Russian Classical Ballet in Colombo- two days of dance-filled performances by an acclaimed troupe of Russian ballerinas- at Nelum Pokuna on March 30 and 31.
While engaging in enhancing the quality of society through cultural activities, the Cultural Section of the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Sri Lanka has been a well known organization of influence for the close-knit relationship between the two countries.
As a result, of this steady friendship, the Cultural Centre invites all citizens to join hands in celebrating the occasion of 60 Years of Diplomatic Relationship between Sri Lanka and Russia at Nelum Pokuna, in the midst of an array of performances that will be staged as fragments from some of the world famous Ballets; Swan Lake, Giselle, Corsair, Sylphide, Cinderella, along with romantic duets and choreographic miniatures like Sri Lanka has never witnessed before.
Dating back to the 18th century, Russia began to adapt to the art of Ballet with the formation of the Royal Danish Ballet and the Imperial Ballet of the Russian Empire. Since then, Ballet has been of paramount importance for Russian Culture.
While this form of dance entered Russia through the influence of Western culture, it was not until the realm of Empress Anna that Russian Ballet was founded by Jean-Baptiste Land, who was the ballet master at a military academy founded by her.
Enriching its society with the finest of art, Russia became home to some of the most notable Ballerinas in the history of theatre. The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Cinderella and the Sleeping Beauty are known to be some of the most momentous Russian Ballets in history.
Gaining an opportunity to witness the magical moves of these Ballerinas that leave you bewildered is an occasional fortuity, and Sri Lanka is once again fortunate to welcome the creative team of Russian Chamber Ballet under the direction of Natalia Permiakova to Colombo in the month of March.
Natalia Permiakova, the Head of the Classical Department of the Boris Eifman Academy of Dance in St. Petersburg is a graduate of the Academy of Russian Ballet and holds a Ph.D. in Pedagogical Sciences. She was the head choreographer of the classical Ballet, Gzhel at the Moscow State Academic Dance Theatre.
Natalia Permiakova, her devoted troupe of youngsters along with the Russian Centre cordially invite all readers to become a part of an enchanting experience that can be cherished for a lifetime as the ballerinas begin to dream on their feet, defying gravity and lifting the art of ballet to a whole new level, states the Russian Cultural Centre in a press release.

Super blue moon lunar eclipse after 152 years
For the first time since 1866, three lunar events - a blood moon total lunar eclipse, a super moon and a blue moon will be visible to us on January 31, 2018 at moon rise in the eastern horizon after 6.15 p.m, Colombo University Astronomy and Space Science Unit Director Prof. Chandana Jayaratne said. Professor Jayaratne also said that there would be somewhat of a high tide on that day due to the closeness of the moon.
He added that no earthquakes or other natural disasters have been reported in the past during similar occurrences, though there were rumours spreading about the onset of natural disasters such as earthquakes, Tsunamis, cyclones etc.
Prof. Jayaratne explained a total lunar eclipse is called a Blood Moon, because of the reddish colour of the Full Moon takes on when fully eclipsed. He further said that when a Full Moon takes place while the Moon is near its closest approach to Earth, in its elliptical shape orbit around the Earth, the moon is called a Super Full Moon or a Super Moon.
He added that however when two full moons fall in the same month, the second full moon is called the blue moon though it does not appear in blue in colour. He also added that these three lunar events take place on January 31 this year.
He said that the total lunar eclipse would be visible to Sri Lanka with the moon rising around 6.15 p.m. Prof.Jayaratne added that the eclipse begins at 4.21 p.m. Sri Lanka Standard Time and would last till 9.38 p.m. From the time the eclipse occurs during day time for Sri Lanka, only the latter part of this eclipse would be visible to us after sunset.
The total eclipse could be observed after 6.22 p.m with the moon completely entering into the umbra - the dark shadow of the Earth.

Tearful Federer wins Australian Open for 20th Slam title
MELBOURNE, Sunday: A tearful Roger Federer surged home to beat Marin Cilic in five riveting sets and win his sixth Australian Open and 20th Grand Slam title in Melbourne on Sunday.
The Swiss defending champion dropped his only sets of the tournament before completing a 6-2, 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 3-6, 6-1 win over the sixth seeded Croatian in 3hr 3min.
Federer, playing in his 30th Grand Slam final, joined Novak Djokovic and Australian great Roy Emerson as joint top for the most Australian Open men's titles.
"Im so happy its unbelievable. This is a dream come true, the fairytale continues for me," Federer said at the presentation.
"After the great year last year, its incredible," the 36-year-old added as he broke down in tears. "This is what you live for, to one day experience these moments.
"This one tonight reminded me more of 2006 here when I beat Marcos Baghdatis in the final and had a great run to the final and was a huge favourite going in," he later explained.
"I was keeping the composure and I was just so relieved when everything was said and done and I think I felt the same way tonight and that's why I couldn't speak, it was terrible."
Federer added to his already imposing win-loss record in Melbourne and is now 94-13. His overall his Grand Slam mark stands at 332-52. Despite his latest triumph, he will remain world No.2 behind Nadal, with Cilic moving to a career-high three.
"It was an amazing journey to come to the final. It could have been the best two weeks of my life, but Roger played a great fifth set," said Cilic, who was chasing his second major title after winning the 2014 US Open.
"I want to thank my team, youre unbelievable. We worked hard for this year, hopefully we will lift these trophies in the future."
Federer now leads Cilic 9-1 with his only defeat coming in the semi-finals of the 2014 US Open. The roof was closed over Rod Laver Arena as the tournament's heat policy was implemented amid enervating evening temperatures of 38 Celsius (100 Fahrenheit).
Federer broke Cilic's serve six times and lost his twice and hit a total of 24 aces to the Croat's 16. Cilic's serve came under immediate pressure with a whipping backhand return winner for break point which the Croatian followed with a smash into the net for a break in the opening game.
The Croat found it difficult to settle as he dropped serve again to trail 0-3. The Swiss star served out the set in just 24 minutes, capitalising on Cilic's shaky opening.
Cilic worked his way back into the match and in the second set tiebreaker he got to two set points when his forehand clipped the line before a winning smash levelled the match as Federer dropped his first set of the tournament.  AFP

Time to berate the state of being chronically late
We laid-back islanders, by and large, are a tardy lot. Yes, we lotus-eaters put more energy into being late than we ever put into our social, working and family lives.
Obviously, we Sri Lankans have a notorious reputation for chronic unpunctuality. Indeed many of us are responsible for throwing certain formal functions that are arranged with clock-work precision completely out of kilter because of our lateness. It is considered rude and boorish behaviour to keep your hosts or organisers and other guests cooling their heels for unacceptable periods of time.
But when one considers being on time for any function or meeting in this neck of the woods people take advantage of Sri Lankan Standard Time and extend it to Sri Lankan stretchable time. Okay it is sometimes acceptable to be late for an informal party where one does not have to stand on ceremony.
Of course many of us are sometimes late for such casual occasions. That is inevitable and pardonable. But I am not talking about the odd occasion of lateness. I am talking about people who are routinely late. In fact, I am focusing on those inconsiderate individuals who are never on time. You know who I am talking about!
Weve all been there. Your car has broken down. The train inexplicably failed to turn up on time. Your dog ate your alarm clock. And so on, and so forth.
While running late might not be ideal, it does happen, and sometimes its really, truly, legitimately not your fault. Sometimes that is. More often than not, however, tardiness isnt due to a random fault in the public transport system. Its a fault in the way we perceive the value of time - namely, other peoples.
Essentially, running late is very poor manners.
Are you the type who is early to a party or a function or do you arrive just on time. Possibly you may be the fashionably late type. Being late for anything - a business meeting, a luncheon, an appointment with a client - suggests a gross lack of reliability. So, being fashionably late is neither fashionable nor profitable. It is downright insensitive, discourteous and often, insulting.
Showing up late wastes other peoples time and increases their stress levels, especially at events where catering is involved. Those whose lives really are so full that they cannot be punctual should be and often are, courteous enough to let people know they will be late.
One thing that gets my gall is the impudence of certain professionals who keep you waiting while running behind schedule after making an appointment. Nothing can be more frustrating than medical specialists who subject their patients to interminably exasperating delays.
Waiting to see a medical specialist is a far different cry from waiting for a flight at an airport. You are often anxious about the appointment, uncomfortable, in pain, or worried. Medicine is different today and so are many of its practitioners. And many of them dont have the basic courtesy to apologise for being late. While there is always the possibility of a medical emergency having caused an unusual delay, most doctors seem pretty consistent with their tardiness.
But here is the bottom line: Expecting me to wait a long time in a doctors office tells me two things. First, I dont feel respected. And secondly, I wonder how committed the practice is to my comfort and to reducing my anxiety when they seem to be putting more emphasis on their needs rather than on mine.
In the world of business, phrases such as time is money are strewn around all day long. I dont care if those phrases, hackneyed as they are, become overused. But I do care when people fail to realise that time is the most valuable resource in any enterprise. It cannot be returned once it has expired. Its simply gone. The end product for lateness is lost revenue, lost business and demoralised employees. If you are the head honcho, dont ever be late. Set the example by being punctual.
The first step that you need to take, so as to improve your punctuality, is to understand the value of time. The majority of the people today take time for granted and do not realise that it is a very precious commodity. Basically it is a question of time management. The day you realise its importance, you will stop wasting it. So, before taking any other step, remind yourself about the value of time.
One of the common attributes of all successful people is that they view their time as a precious resource. When you are late for appointments with people who value their time, you will have wasted one of their most valuable assets and there is a good chance they will view you as rude, irresponsible and disrespectful. Is this how you want to brand yourself
Not only should you make every effort to be on time for business-related appointments, but you should also do your utmost to be on time for personal commitments. Valuing your friends time and earning their respect is an important part of your individual reputation.
Punctuality is a synonym for professionalism and respect. It is integrity in action. Such regularity is an important component of our personality and the lengthening shadow of a persons character is at the heart of every successful organisation or enterprise.
If a company head has no regard for punctuality, its a safe bet the organisations employees mirror the bosss bad habit. Time is money. Tardiness drains a companys funds. How many thousands of bucks are spent annually waiting for the meeting to start How many prospective clients have taken their business elsewhere after being angered by having to wait for you or one of your employees to show up at an important business meeting
But there are always extenuating circumstances that do arise and it wont always be possible to be on time. Still, if you are going to be late for an appointment, call as soon as you know you are going to be late. This allows others to plan their schedules accordingly. Mobile phones make this an easy thing to do.
To put it in a nutshell: Punctuality is important because it is polite to be on time. Being late leaves the impression that a person is irresponsible or unprofessional. This can have a detrimental impact on both your current work and future employment prospects. On a personal level chronic lateness can strain relationships and cause other people to have to readjust their schedules accordingly.
As a general rule, it is far better to show up 10 minutes early than it is to be even five minutes late. Punctual people are seen as trustworthy. Persistently late people are not.
And I dont care if I sound old-fashioned, because actually it has nothing to do with fashion or generation. It has got everything to do with basic good manners and respect for other people.

Trusting the coach paid dividends says Chandimal
MIRPUR: Sri Lankan skipper Dinesh Chandimal said that trusting their new head coach Chandika Hathurusingha paid dividends as it resulted in the team turning things around to clinch the tri-series in Bangladesh.
Sri Lanka were in dire straits before entering the tournament and began it in disastrous fashion before completing a remarkable turnaround.
Hathurusingha was the only new introduction in the Sri Lankan dressing room as he joined the Sri Lankan setup after relinquishing his post as Bangladesh's head coach. "We all know he is a really good coach. He gave confidence, to everyone. That's the main thing," said Chandimal after the win on Saturday.
"If you can trust your coach, good results will come. That's what he did. This is all about hard work from the players and the coach," he pointed out.
"He is the one who brought the team here, so credit goes to him also. It was a really happy moment to us. This is what we wanted, winning the series, we grabbed the opportunity with both hands. We are over the moon. This is all about hard work, especially after you lose the first two games, it is difficult to get back in this kind of tournament.
"The guys put their heart and soul in practice and then when they go to the middle they put their heart and soul. They had the plans and they executed it well, and credit goes to everyone who played the series," beamed Chandimal.
The skipper also credited Upul Tharanga and Niroshan Dickwella for their partnership which he believed changed the complexion of the game considering it was a difficult wicket to bat on.
"It was tough. I prayed before the toss, I need to win the toss. It was a dry wicket. Credit goes to Upul and Dickwella, they put on a 70-run partnership. That was the turning point," he said. "We knew after 20 overs that if we can get 220-230, that's a winning total for us."
Chandimal added that despite scoring a not so impressive total they were confident of winning as they believed they had some surprise to offer the hosts. It came in the form of right-arm pacer Shehan Madushanka who became the fourth bowler in history to claim a hat-trick on debut as Sri Lanka crushed Bangladesh by 79 runs.
Madushanka claimed Bangladesh's last three wickets as he finished with 3-26 to help Sri Lanka bowl out the Tigers for 142 runs in 41.1 overs after they were restricted to 221 runs.
Mashrafe, Gunathilaka guilty
Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza has been fined 20 per cent of his match fee, while Sri Lanka opener Danushka Gunathilaka has received an official reprimand for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during the final of the tri-series in Mirpur on Saturday.
Both the players were found to have breached Article 2.1.7 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.
In addition to this, one demerit point each has been added to the disciplinary records of the two players.
While this was Gunathilakas first offence, Mashrafe has been sanctioned for the second time since the introduction of the revised Code in September 2016. He had received one demerit point for breaching Article 2.1.7 in the ODI series against England on 10 October 2016. As such, he now has two demerit points against his name.
The incident involving Mashrafe happened in Sri Lankas sixth over when the captain ran close to Kusal Mendis after he fell to Mehidy Hasan while yelling loudly and looking directly at the opener in a manner that could have provoked an aggressive reaction.
The incident involving Gunathilaka happened in the sixth over of Bangladeshs innings when, following the dismissal of Tamim Iqbal, he yelled loudly at the departing batsman which prompted the opener to react by turning to face him. Both the players admitted the offences and accepted the sanctions proposed by David Boon of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charges were levelled by on-field umpires Chettithody Shamshuddin and Sharfuddoula, third umpire Bruce Oxenford and fourth umpire Anisur Rahman.
Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

According to the video footage a cleric known as Niyaz Maulavi is responsible for vitriolic and inflammatory criticism of womens involvement in politics and includes his use of profanities in this regard. He has released degrading statements tarnishing the reputation of female candidates thereby indicating that his objective is their withdrawal from the elections. Female candidates from the Puttlam district, the Northern and Eastern Provinces are targets. The cleric claims to be a member of the Jamiuththowheed also known as Thowheed Jamath, he said.
Consequent to the sentiments aroused by these videos, on January 19, an office of a female candidate in the area was set on fire. CMEV National Organiser Manjua Gajanayake said that those statements were totally against the Constitution.
He said a surprise raid was carried out on January 15 against a SLMC female candidate C A Rinuza Ilmas office based on a baseless complaint made to 119. He added that Renuka Damayanthi, an independent candidate for Wellawaya, was hospitalised as she sustained injuries in a conflict between supporters.
He added that the house of UNP female candidate for Ariyampathi electorate, K Jeyachandrikas, has been stoned on December 12. He added that there were several other incidents too.

A year among the boat my people
Every society is replete with the invisible. They are human beings of flesh and blood who live before our eyes and yet, as Ralph Ellisons protagonist in Invisible Man states, we refuse to see them. We hand them our credit cards at supermarket check-outs, fill our stomachs with vegetables that grow on their farms, wave at them in the street when we need a ride. We encounter them all the time, yet they remain invisible to us.
They become visible when the wall that separates us from them cracks open and we hear their voices roar across public space. Those moments are rare but memorable: invisible Americans enjoyed a moment in daylight when Barack Obama won the presidency, the invisible French when Nicolai Sarkozy lost the election, the invisible Egyptians when the world media turned their cameras on Tahrir square.
Political spectrum
Iran is no exception. To the middle class denizens of metropolitan areas in Iran, a large portion of the society is invisible. It doesnt matter how far left on the political spectrum you are, or how concerned you are with the rights of the underdog. That wall hardly cracks. And when it does, we respond in confusion: Who are these people Where have they been
We are occasionally bestowed brief glances, often thanks to mass uprisings, which tend to force faces onto TV screens that we would never see otherwise. For me, those encounters came about serendipitously: I got to spend a year with a small number of invisible Iranians an ocean away from home, in Australia.
I have been working for an NGO that helps out refugees, said Ali. I ran into him on the sixth floor of the school of Languages and Cultures at the University of Queensland in Australia. Ali and I were the only Iranians in the building. Every time we met we talked.
English enigma
People at the NGO are looking for a volunteer who has experience teaching English.
Im happy to help, I said, with that insincere mix of reluctance and politeness that dresses up evasion as acceptance.
It was early 2013. Id come to Australia a little more than a year before that. My nerves had reached a breaking point in Iran. I felt I had suffered my share of the worlds misery and deserved a break.
Ali got that and didnt insist. We parted ways but the conversation stayed with me.
The move to Australia had come as a huge relief, as if a great weight had lifted. But as is often the case when the pressures recede, I found there was something lacking in my life, a space that needed filling. Three years of working on a PhD thesis was not going to fill it. I needed more. Ali had offered me a clear way to retrieve my relevance in the world, and I had stupidly passed.
Later that same day I tracked him down. A week later, I was standing in front of a class of about 40 refugees, ready to start giving English lessons.
I was a reluctant immigrant to Australia.
Political immigrants
The categories of immigrants in the world are numerous and growing: internal immigrant, economic immigrant, political immigrants, refugees, etc. It wont hurt if I add one.
Reluctant immigrants, in my lexicon, land somewhere between refugees and deliberate immigrants. Reluctant immigrants would have stayed wherever they lived had they not been under enormous pressure. They have that in common with most refugees. Yet, unlike refugees, when push comes to shove, reluctant immigrants have access to enough resources to get a job offer or university admission from a western country.
They are privileged enough to obtain visas and purchase plane tickets. They dont have to take the risk of traveling by foot or on rickety boats. That part they share with deliberate immigrants.
As of the summer of 2009, I had never considered leaving Iran. I worked as an editor in a decent publishing house, wrote a weekly column in a newspaper people cared to read, had written a few books, had an apartment, many friends, one partner. Then hell broke loose. Middle East style.
Three days after the 2009 presidential election, three million people showed up in Azadi Street and held a silent march to protest the outcome of the election. That event marked the beginning of the Green Movement. Political unrest blew through the country like a hurricane. I was among the affected. The newspaper I wrote for was shut down. The publisher I worked for was shut down. Hardly a week passed without hearing that friends had been arrested, colleagues disappeared, acquaintances turned fugitive. Like thousands of other young Iranians at the time, I decided to leave.
I researched how to apply to university programs abroad, hastily put together a proposal and sent it off to a few places in Australia. My partner at the time had Australian citizenship, which made it easy to move between the two countries. The University of Queensland accepted the proposal. Within a few months, Id gone from someone certain about a future in Iran to a reluctant immigrant.

Griggs on fire again as Wigan stun West Ham in FA Cup
LONDON, Saturday - Wigan Athletic pulled off the big shock of the FA Cup fourth round on Saturday as the team from the third-tier of English football knocked out Premier League West Ham United 2-0 with a famous double from their cult hero Will Grigg.
West Ham were not the only top-flight side to flounder in Englands famous knock-out competition, however, as Liverpool lost 3-2 at Anfield to West Bromwich Albion in a game overshadowed by the theatre surrounding the new VAR technology.
On a day of typical FA Cup drama, Tottenham Hotspur were also eight minutes from tumbling out at League Two (fourth-tier) Newport County until a Harry Kane tap-in salvaged a 1-1 draw. The Premier Leagues bottom club Swansea City were also held to a 1-1 draw at League Two Notts County while Huddersfield Town drew 1-1 with Championship (second-tier) visitors Birmingham City.
Above all, it was David Moyess West Ham who suffered the sort of nightmare Cup afternoon the bigger clubs dread.
Wigans hero proved to be Northern Ireland striker Grigg, who again found himself the subject of the fans favourite chorus of Will Griggs On Fire as he headed home after seven minutes and converted a second-half penalty.
To compound their misery, the Hammers had to play for more than 40 minutes with 10 men after Arthur Masuaku was sent off soon after the break for spitting at Wigans Nick Powell.
League One leaders Wigan, who knocked out Premier League Bournemouth in the third round, have seen fortunes dip since lifting the Cup in 2013.
Yet their fans at the DW Stadium were again left celebrating when Grigg scored his second in the 62nd minute from the spot.
A Cup run is great. The extra games are no problem for us. If it is a top Premier League team next, we will take that, said a delighted Grigg.
FAVOURITES FALTER
Liverpool suffered their first defeat at Anfield this season, a double from Jay Rodriguez inspiring West Brom to triumph against all the odds - and VAR.
Rodriguezs brace in four minutes swiftly overturned Roberto Firminos fifth-minute goal before the video technology took centre stage.
First, it was used to rule out an early West Brom goal from Craig Dawson for offside.
Then referee Craig Pawson used his pitchside monitor at length - the first time the on-field review has occurred in the English game - to change his decision and award a penalty to Liverpool after a foul by Jake Livermore on Mohamed Salah.
Firmino, though, hit the bar with his spot-kick and Albion manager Alan Pardews angry features only changed once Joel Matip diverted a cross into his own net just before the break.
Salahs late strike, amid plenty of Liverpool pressure, proved not enough to save the Reds who were again let down by poor defending.
Newport were close to pulling off an authentic FA Cup sensation against a side 72 places above them in the league hierarchy as they led Spurs 1-0 through a first-half headed goal from Irishman Padraig Amond.
Yet the dream evening for Newport in front of a 10,000 sell-out crowd was ruined when Kane pounced after an 83rd-minute corner to notch his 30th goal of the season in all competitions.
Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino was unhappy with the commitment of his side, telling reporters he was relieved a lot and that the team didnt really show that they wanted to go through to the next round.
Swansea were also given an uncomfortable ride in a 1-1 draw at Meadow Lane after Luciano Narsinghs goal just before halftime was answered by another goal in the 62nd minute from Notts Countys 34-year-old forward Jon Stead who has scored in all four rounds of the Cup this season.
Leicester City won 5-1 at League One Peterborough thanks to two goals each from Fousseni Diabate on his debut and Kelechi Iheanacho. - Agencies

Joint Opposition (JO) Parliamentarians or Provincial Council Members canvassing for the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP, Pohottuwa) have not obtained membership in that party, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva said.
The Chief Minister was addressing an SLFP rally held at Vilegoda, Ambalangoda recently.
He said political leaders requesting people to join the SLPP were still holding SLFP membership. They had abandoned President Maithripala Sirisena and embraced Mahinda Rajapaksa since they could not join the former due to their tarnished political image.
He said President Sirisena acted democratically in decision-making in his capacity as the President of the SLFP Any political leader cannot match him. The President always makes decisions to benefit the party and the country, he said.

SL to deepen FTA with India, sign one with China soon
Sri Lanka will deepen the FTA with India towards a comprehensive economic and technology cooperation agreement and will also finalise a FTA with China during this year, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
This will be followed by FTAs with Thailand and Malaysia. This is in addition to the FTA Sri Lanka has with Pakistan, he said welcoming over 75 leading Japanese business leaders to Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka also signed one with Singapore few days ago during the visit of the Singaporean Prime Minister which is Sri Lankas first comprehensive FTA covering goods, services, investment, e-commerce, government procurement, telecommunications and financial services.
For a Japanese business looking for a credible and comfortable springboard to South Asia and beyond, there is no better place than Sri Lanka. With the new FTAs, investors can gain preferential market access to a market of nearly three billion people. Sri Lanka is probably one of the few countries in the world that can claim this!
With our excellent strategic location, we have also become attractive for Belt and Road projects from China, the Minister said.
Samarawickrama also said that Japan has been a steady and long-standing partner of Sri Lanka, in supporting infrastructure development, knowledge exchange, and technical cooperation.
Sri Lanka and Japan also have a trade and investment relationship dating back many decades. the two countries entered into a Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Treaty in 1982 and a Double Tax Avoidance Agreement back in 1967. The government is focusing on reform initiatives to catalyse growth and create better jobs for our people.
The focus of the government is to shift the economic growth model from one that was heavily dependent on debt-fuelled public infrastructure spending, to growth driven more by private enterprises, exports, and foreign direct investment, he said.

Anuradha Herath stars as CH ram Army from behind
A spectacular last minute try scored by former Peterite ruggerite cum CH winger Anuradha Herath off a superb off load by inspirational ex-Sri Lanka captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa and a stunning touch line conversion slotted in by St. Anthonys College Kandy star player Samuel Maduwantha seconds before the final whistle saw CH&FC come from behind to pull off a stunning 30-28 win over Army SC in their Dialog 'A' division inter-club league rugby second round match played at Havelock Park yesterday
CH scored their 30 points through 4 tries, 2 conversions and 2 penalties to Armys 28 that came off 4 tries, 1 conversion and 2 penalties. At half time CH trailed Army 15-17.
CH showed better control of the ball in perfect conditions and turned the match in their favour with a rousing game carried out in the second half.
CH were always sure of what to do, in contrast to the Army who only knew to run straight often into their opposite number and thereby lost the grip on the game and any hopes of winning due to the game they carried throughout the entire second half.
However the Army outfit staged a spirited performance in the first half by scoring three quick tries to lead the game and go into the breather with a two point lead.
But CH gave a superb brand of running rugby in the second half under the instructions of their head coach Tavita Thulagaese "Laga" where they enjoyed major share of possession from the scrums, line outs, set pieces and the break downs by putting up a sensational effort to topple Army and dared to run the ball and gain territory whenever a gap in the opponents defence was detected.
CH sealed the game by scoring a total of four tries through flanker Yoshitha Rajapaksa (one), crack centre Lee Keegal (one), flanker Kanchana Lakshitha (one) and Anuradha Herath (one). Fly half Samuel Maduwantha put over the two conversions and the two penalties.
Prop forward Nanayakkara, wing three quarters Bandara and Sudaraka Dikkumbura along with fly half Ashan Bandara scored one try apiece for Army. The solitary conversion and the two penalties were slotted in by their full back Gayan Salinda.
Referee Charlie Brown from Singapore had an excellent game with the whistle.

Prof. Sivapathasundaram Mageswaran
Mentor par excellence
Tears roll down my face whenever the thoughts of two persons come to my mind. Both lost their lives in their prime. One is my elder brother who was also my guardian and the other is Jaffna University Chemistry Department founder Head Professor Sivapathasundaram Mageswaranone of the pioneers of the University.
February 2, 2018, marks the 20th death anniversary of our beloved professor. This is an attempt to remember some aspects of his unique and remarkable life.
To me, Professor Mageswaran was the most inspiring teacher, a mentor par excellence, a reliable friend and an honest well-wisher. To have had Professor Mageswaran as my teacher and mentor was a gift from God.
The Jaffna University was initiated in the mid-1970's. Prof. Mageswaran joined it as one of its pioneers and served until his untimely death in 1998. He was the youngest among the pioneers and proved to be the most enthusiastic and energetic among the finest of them. He played a major role in shaping the institution into a strong academic entity.
As the founding Head of the Department of Chemistry, he worked tirelessly to produce graduates of outstanding quality. Initially, the department was housed in the undergraduate section of the Jaffna College and had to manage with very limited resources. He balanced these limitations through his hard work.
I was among the first batch of students admitted to the Chemistry department. Whenever we had a problem in our studies or in our personal life, he was there to listen. He gave us his time and inspiration generously.
It is a legend even today, how he oversaw the construction of the Chemistry building at the Thirunelveli premises of the University, while at the same time, attending to all his regular duties. Once the workers were adding cement, gravel, and sand in the concrete mixer, he was counting the number of sacks. When he noticed that the ratio was not the same as the standard one, he went to the site and stopped the work.
Since he took a keen interest in the good name of the University and the welfare of the students, all who worked with him also took a similar interest.
As a great leader, he showed the path by example and not by preaching. Anyone who places their self-interest first cannot make a lasting contribution to a public institution. Mageswaran's contributions to the University stand as proof to his selfless service.
Prof. Mageswaran functioned as the Head of the Department of Chemistry for a long time. He was twice elected as the Dean of the Faculty of Science. This was during one of the most difficult periods of war and he guided the department and the faculty with resolve, tact and caution. He also functioned as an elected member to the University Council and served on several boards and committees.
In all these positions, he left an indelible mark as a person who worked on principles and one never gave up on them. His principles were not founded merely on regulations or laws, but on the higher philosophies that guided the making of those laws and regulations.
He also made sure that any ambiguity in the interpretation of regulations did not lead to dilution of standards.
Professor Mageswaran was a man of unblemished record of integrity. He was frank in whatever he did. He fought to ensure that the University of Jaffna maintained high standards in education and administration although, at times, this earned him the annoyance of many.
The virtue of all achievement, in the words of A. J. Cronin, is victory over oneself. Professor Mageswaran knew of this victory and hence, there was no defeat for him. Generations to come will scarce believe that such a man as this one ever in flesh and blood, walked upon this Earth. These are the words of Albert Einstein about Mahatma Gandhi. The same words also fit to Professor Mageswaran.
Prof. Mageswaran had his secondary education at Kokuvil Hindu College. His classmates remember his as an exceptionally gifted, all-round student.
He played cricket and football. He was a talented spinner and had a big fan group for his batting. They recall how stadium would be filled with enthusiastic cries and applause whenever he appeared at the grounds.
Later, he entered the then University of Ceylon, Colombo, followed the Special Degree course in Chemistry, and in the final year, was transferred to Peradeniya. He passed out with Honours in 1966, and after serving in the University of Peradeniya as an Assistant Lecturer, left for UK in 1968.
He completed his MSc and PhD degrees at the Sheffield University. On his return, Professor Mageswaran served at the Peradeniya University for a few years before joining the Jaffna University. Professor Kumar, a longtime friend of Professor Mageswaran, lyrically described the circumstances under which Professor Mageswaran spent a major part of his working years in Jaffna:
He lived through the tensions of life in Jaffna through bombing, shelling, and uncertain atmosphere of guerilla war... The feeling that one will be unable to access hospitals in times, of need, the feeling that the hospital may not have a doctor who can treat one even if one gets there, the feeling that the hospital may not have the drugs the doctor prescribesthese have been everyday fears... There is no doubt that these conditions contributed to the deterioration of his health.
In 1997, he went to India for treatment. On his return, he told me that only 40 percent of his heart was functioning and that surgeons had informed him that they could not perform the necessary by-pass surgery. Nave may be, I never believed that a disease could take his life so soon. I was proved wrong to my profound sorrow.
He carried on for a few more months by his sheer determination and willpower. The end came on the February 2, 1998. His funeral was one of the biggest to be held in Jaffna.
Students carried the casket on their shoulders for several miles as hundreds of students, former students, staff, and admirers marched along in tears. It was a testimony to his life.
Dr. N. Sivapalan, Senior Chemistry Lecturer, University of Jaffna
M. D. Wimalasuriya
He was ahead of his time
My father, M. D. Wimalasuriya, who passed away on March 8, 1987, would have been 100 years old on January 27, 2018. Some of his students who have reached great heights in their chosen careers dominate the public service of Sri Lanka today. Their appreciation of my fathers true love of his profession as a teacher/principal, bear testimony to his dedication to his role as a teacher/principal of Dharmasoka College, many years ago
He was as much a dedicated father as he was a conscientious teacher/role model to his students.
To my father, his alma-mater was the place where he created dreams for his students. One such dream was the two-mile swim in the ocean, which he successfully executed in collaboration with Dr. Visvanathan.
As a loving father, he devoted his energy to his four children; three daughters and an only son.
I remember with a pang of pain, the weekly letters he wrote to me during my first year away from home, when I was in school in Colombo during the 1960's. Perhaphs both of us would have been nostalgic about home, but my father distracted me from my home-sickness with his letters. He instilled in me not only a sense of independence, but also a love of English language and literature.
If my father were alive today, he would no doubt be proud of his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. He would have spoken of his past misdemeanours and may have also mentioned the value of education and gender equality, which he believed at a time when the world was yet to talk about such topics.
Thaththa, you were ahead of your time.
My dearest Thaththa, I am ever so grateful to you for making me who I am today. The only way I can show my gratitude to you is to worship your wedding photograph that hangs on the wall in front of our bed as I wake up every morning. You look so handsometall, charismatic, and dignified in your double-breasted suit in the photo. You smile at me as if to say "Keep calm and score goals."

The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 12.68% (or LKR 0.51Bn) to the market driven by Cargills, Lion Brewery & Ceylon Tobacco which accounted for 86.66% of the sector turnover.

Printcare Plc(+13.7% W-o-W) and Swarnamahal Finance (+12.5% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers.
Agalawatte Plantations finance was the weeks highest price loser, declining 17.5% W-o-W to close at LKR18.80 while Amana Takaful (-14.3% Y-o-Y), AMF Co Ltd (-13.0% W-o-W) & Kahawatte(-12.5% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 1.35Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 0.34Bn (+292.67% W-o-W).
Total foreign purchases increased by 33.06% W-o-W to LKR 3.04Bn from last weeks value of LKR 2.88Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 1.69Bn relative to LKR 1.94Bn recorded last week (-12.86% W-o-W).
In terms of volume JKH & Commercial Bank led foreign purchases while Anilana Hotels & LOLC Finance led foreign sales.
In terms of value HNB & JKH led foreign purchases while Lion Brewery & Hayleys led foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets turned positive this week as markets reversed a 10-day losing streak to close the week on a positive note.
Since hitting an eight week high of 6540.5 during the 2nd week of trading in 2018, markets have recorded two consecutive weeks of profit-taking; this weeks positive momentum however, helped push the YTD gain on the Index up to 0.7% (cf. 0.5% last week and 2% in the 1st week of trading in 2018).
Market activity continued to be driven by stronger institutional and HNI activity for the 3rd consecutive week, with off-market crossings amounting to Rs. 2.6Bn or 65% of total market turnover.
Institutional and HNI participation so far this year has ranged at a high 60-65%, notably higher than the Q417 average of ~45%. Relative to last week, when significant interest in Banking counters drove investor appetite, this weeks crossings were driven largely by blue-chips and Banks, with JKH accounting for 45% of total crossings while COMB accounted for 14% of total crossings and HNB accounted for 19% of crossings.
Foreign inflows to the domestic equities meanwhile, rebounded sharply this week, reversing the slowing pace of foreign flows over the last two weeks.
Net inflows to the CSE rose to a notable Rs.1.4Bn this week, higher than the net inflows of Rs. 344Mn and Rs. 359Mn in the last two weeks but lower than the Rs. 1.9Bn inflow in the first week of trading.
Markets in the holiday-shortened trading week ahead are likely to move side-ways as further profit taking is likely to be off-set by continued buying interest.
Base effect pushes December inflation lower
NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation levels in the economy, continued to follow the declining trajectory exhibited since the early months of 2017.
NCPI Core inflation consequently fell to 2.7% Y-o-Y in Dec17, down from 2.8% Y-o-Y in Nov17 and 7% Y-o-Y at the end of Q117, and 4.1% Y-o-Y at the end of Q217.
Headline inflation levels during December meanwhile fell to 7.3% Y-o-Y down from 8.4% Y-o-Y in Nov17 due the high base that prevailed in December 2016.
The CPC import price of Crude oil during Q417 meanwhile, largely tracked the increasing trend in the global price of the commodity, with price increases primarily due to the weaker dollar, healthy world economic growth forecasts, OPEC-led production cuts and U.S. crude inventories declining for the 10th consecutive week.
Unexpected supply disruptions at the end of December meanwhile pushed Brent crude oil prices to new two-year highs and this uptrend has continued in Jan2018.
Mid-month Crude oil prices rose to a near 3-year high of $70 a barrel as the OPEC-led coalitions decision in November to extend their production limitation agreement beyond its previous deadline of March, generated further space for the end of the supply glut which caused a major dip in prices since 20141.
Global oil Analyst estimates expect Brent crude prices to remain within a range of $60  $66 a barrel in 2018 and the impact of these relatively higher global oil prices is likely to impact supply-side inflation levels in Sri Lanka.

Bruno Mars grabs (nearly) all the Grammys

Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar stole the show, and most of the awards, at the 2018 Grammys.
Mars provided the night's big upset, taking the album of the year trophy that most critics assumed would go to Lamar's rap tour de force, Damn.
In the end, voters found Mars's crowd-pleasing R&B more palatable, while Lamar dominated the rap categories.
Alessia Cara won best new artist - making her the only female artist to win a major prize.
Stars like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Lorde and SZA were overlooked, with only 17 awards (out of a total of 86) going to women or female-fronted bands.
The imbalance was particularly incongruous on a night that highlighted the #TimesUp and #MeToo campaigns.
Most performers arrived for the showwearing a white roseto symbolise their support for the movements, which address sexual harassment and inequality.
Pop star Kesha also gave a powerful, stirring performance of her single Praying, which addresses her own experience of surviving abuse.
She was backed by an all-star choir, including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello, who were dressed in white to reflect the white rose campaign.
"We come in peace but we mean business," said R&B star Janelle Monae, introducing the performance.
"To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time's Up.
"We say Time's Up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power."
"Let's work together, women and men, as a united music industry committed to creating more safe work environments, equal pay, and access for all women."
The night's other pivotal moment was a tribute to the music-loving victims of the tragedies in Manchester and Las Vegas.
Handwritten notes bearing the names of the dead were projected on the stage as country music stars Maren Morris, Eric Church and Brothers Osborne performed Eric Clapton's Tears In Heaven.
All three acts played at the Route 91 festival last October before a gunman opened fire on the audience, killing 58.
"All of country music was reminded in the most tragic way then connection we share with fans and the loving power that music will always provide," said Eric Church, choking back tears.
"We wanted to come together and honour the memory of the beautiful, music-loving souls so cruelly taken from us," added Morris.

Mars left with six trophies in all, including the three biggest prizes: Album of the year, song of the year and record of the year.
Speaking onstage, he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, saying: "You guys are the reason why I'm in the studio pulling my hair out".
He also told the story of how, as a 15-year-old in Hawaii, he performed in a show called The Magic of Polynesia, singing songs by R&B writers Babyface, Jam & Lewis and Terry Riley.
"I'll be honest, I was incredible at 15," he laughed, before explaining how he'd wanted to recapture the sounds of those 80s and 90s hits on his latest album.
"Those songs were written with nothing but joy... and that's all I wanted to bring with this album. Hopefully I could feel that again and see everybody dancing and everybody moving."
As well as the star's own prizes, his recording engineers won a further award for their work on the album.
His victory robbed Kendrick Lamar's more urgent, political album of the night's main prizes - but the Compton-born star still took home five trophies, including best rap album, best rap song and best rap performance.
He also opened the ceremony, in New York's Madison Square Gardens, with a provocative, politically-charged performance that featured contributions from U2 and Dave Chapelle.
"I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America," observed Chapelle in the middle of the segment.
Lamar's victories came at the expense of rap veteran Jay-Z and his soul-baring album 4:44.
Jay-Z won none of his eight nominations and chose not to perform at the three-hour show. But Lamar tipped his hat to the elder star, declaring "Jay for president!" as he collected the best rap album award.
The night also saw performances from Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Pink and Patti LuPone, who sang Evita's Don't Cry For Me Argentina as part of a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber.
Ed Sheeran, who could not attend the ceremony, won two prizes - best pop vocal performance for Shape Of You and best pop album for Divide.
There were also posthumous awards for Leonard Cohen and actress Carrie Fisher, who won best spoken word album for the audio version of her memoirs, The Princess Diarist.

Mobile phone bill payment with SPC funds
Case against Keheliya fixed for Feb. 2
The Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court yesterday fixed for February 2 to deliver its order on preliminary objections raised by former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman.
This is regarding a case for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs. 230,984 to the government after paying former Ministers mobile phone bill using SPC funds, while Rambukwella was functioning as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
The defence had raised preliminary objections regarding the maintainability of the charge sheet.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had induced the CPC chairman to pay his (minister's) mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012 to April 14, 2012 causing an unlawful loss to the government, while the minister was serving as the Mass Media Minister.
The Bribery Commission had named former (SPC) Chairman Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda as an accused for aiding and abetting to commit the offence. The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed this case against the former minister and former SPC Chairman under Section 70 of the Bribery Act on three counts.
Counsel Anuradha Siriwardena, the Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission, appeared for the prosecution. Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.

Power of apology
With the Sri Lankas 70th Independence Day on the horizon, it is an opportunity to look back at what we have achieved as a country since the British left in 1948. The country was born as one of the strongest democracies in the region. A vibrant economy that should have fuelled rapid development and an educated population with a universal franchise that should have taken the country from strength to strength. Yet we somehow squandered that opportunity, the golden moment, like so many other newly independent nations by chasing power and riches.
So the question now is how will we spend the next 70 years A country at peace, with equitable rights for all or a country, still disunited and haunted by its past What lies between our past and a future that all our children deserve is reconciliation. But what is reconciliation What does a reconciled country look like Does it happen through a new constitution An independent judicial system Maybe strengthened governance
The truth is reconciliation start in our heart. It is our ability to acknowledge the harm done to us, and done by us. Instead of seeking revenge or trying to forget, to be able to ask for forgiveness and give forgiveness. Learning to separate the harm from the harm-doer, and see the people we have learnt to hate and fear as brothers and sisters again.
It would send such a powerful message, if on the day of Independence, the President reached out to the Tamil community and say we dont know yet if it was 7,000 people or 40,000 people who died during those last few months of the war, but I am sorry we failed to protect you. Just a few simple words, which require an enormous moral courage which I believe the President has, might just begin the healing process. For acknowledging the harm done can sooth the deep pain so many in the country still face silently.
We have been at war with ourselves for so long that no one is innocent and everyone has become a victim. So reconciliation does not happen only through institutional restructuring and complicated political manoeuvring; it happens between us, as the people of this island, reaching out to each other again and unite as equal human beings with the same hopes and dreams. And asking and giving forgiveness. For we are only human through the humane way we treat each other and when we dehumanise the other, we dehumanise ourselves.

Cost of education
What is important in knowledge is not quantity, but quality. It is important to know what is significant, what is less so, and what is trivial.  Leo Tolstoy
Sri Lanka has a limited intake to state universities. Hence a majority of parents send their children to non-state higher education institutes. The development of a market economy has greatly affected the structural reform of education. One result is the establishment of non-state higher educational institutes.
In the non-state sector some institutes have signed Memorandum of Understandings (MOU) with foreign universities. Some foreign universities engage their agents or consultants in Sri Lanka in sending the children to foreign universities.
While obtaining the services of state sector academics and one time audit of foreign university many of the non-state institutes engage in providing higher education under the recognition obtained from UGC through the listing of the respective university in International Handbook of Universities published by International Association of Universities or in Commonwealth Universities Yearbook published by Association of Commonwealth Universities. These international publications have their own criteria in evaluating universities. This does not guarantee the quality of the provision of the local higher education by the local non-state institute.
Most of the non-state institutes are operating for merely commercial purpose except very few established for better student outcome in Sri Lanka. How are non-state institutes then nurture respect and understanding through such an initiative
University is a place to nurture mutual respect. Not all the institutes are better places for learning. Many of the non-state initiatives lack internal quality assurance units and systems and they are merely set up for generating income. There is no student feedback system to develop the student-oriented learning the culture and there is no either recreational facility for students, no libraries in the local institutes or study centres especially in Northern and Eastern provinces.
Global demand for higher education
By 2025, the projected global demand for higher education could reach 263 million students, which is an increase from a little less than 100 million students in 2000 (Karaim, 2011, p. 551). This could represent an increase of 163 million students in 25 years (Karaim, 2011). As the demand for quality education increases, there is a growing demand for quality assurance (QA) for international universities where there is increased mobility of students, faculty, programmes, and higher education institutions in global networks (Hou, 2012; Varonism, 2014). Quality assurance can be a driver for institutions to achieve excellence in higher education. However, ensuring that the quality of educational programmes meets local and international standards simultaneously has become a great challenge in many countries (OECD & World Bank, 2007). In such a circumstances setting up of local institutes need proper quality assurance mechanism rather offering degree programmes in an unorganised manner.
Most of the non-state initiatives are for a commercial purpose and there is no student-centred learning atmosphere at all. Many of the students depend on their opinion of the colleagues and peers when entering such institutes. Once they complete their degrees local students are not getting provisional certificates, transcripts or even the degree certificate on time. Rather many of the non-state local institutes provide a course completion letter which of low quality. Most of the students who complete their degree programmes through study centres in Northern, Eastern provinces face a very tragic situation. Many of the non-state higher education arrangements are merely centres in Northeastern provinces where student outcome of such study centres are questionable to date even though their university is a listed university in the International Handbook of Universities and Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU). There is no regulatory mechanism in Sri Lanka in such non-state initiatives.
Higher education in South Asian region
In contrary to the Sri Lankan initiatives India has a holistic view of the higher education including its administration. Indian universities are at the forefront of new research initiatives, and at the same time, face enormous challenges in meeting the growing demand for higher education among the youth population, having a large student community and a huge network of state and non-state universities. Therefore the Association of Commonwealth Universities (ACU) is committed to developing programmes within the region that meet the needs of the region. This collaboration will enable the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) to draw more closely on the experience and expertise of the ACU. Meanwhile, the AIU will help the ACU better represent and advocate for its growing numbers of member institutions in India.
They are providing joint funded proposal to establish a leadership training and capacity-building programme for senior administrators in Indian universities in meeting the growing demand for higher education among the youth population. India is an emerging economy with a population of 1.3 billion  almost half of the population of the Commonwealth. Over 50% of India's population, or around 600 million, is under 25 years; and within the next five years, India will have the largest Tertiary-age population in the world.
We need to understand that an educated young person is a person who is capable of protecting him or herself and who is a potential contributor to the process of building peace. Is it possible to produce such a personality through commercializing business entities which do not think about student recreational facilities, proper governance, financial viability, proper maintenance of ethics and code of practice in human resources Many of the Sri Lankan parents do not verify properly about such business entities they just want their children to follow any programme no matter whatever the outcome of the programme.
Training and capacity building of state and non-state administration is essential in order to address these emerging needs. Further, a common framework for a quality assurance in higher education in Sri Lanka is essential in order to address the issues in the state and non-state sector.

Daily dose of vitamin D eases agonising IBS
A daily dose of vitamin D may ease the agonising pain of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), new research suggests. The so-called sunshine supplement can return sufferers bowel habits to normal, which could even benefit their mental health, a US study review found. IBS has previously been linked to depression and anxiety.
Although the researchers did not speculate on how vitamin D lessens IBS, past research shows the nutrient is anti-inflammatory, which may ease discomfort in sufferers bowels.
IBS affects between 10 and 15 per cent of people in the UK. It occurs when sufferers experience symptoms, such as abdominal pain and a change in bowel habits, but there is no clear cause behind them.
Vitamin D may prevent inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, research suggested in November 2017.
The so-called sunshine supplement strengthens the immune system, which helps to prevent the body from attacking healthy cells and causing autoimmune conditions, like arthritis.
Rheumatoid arthritis, which causes joint swelling, may also benefit from vitamin Ds anti-inflammatory effects.
Yet, as the painful joint condition reduces a sufferers vitamin D sensitivity, patients may not benefit from taking such supplements once they have developed the disorder, or at least not at recommended doses, according to the researchers.
Study author Dr Louisa Jeffery from the University of Birmingham, said: Our research indicates that maintaining sufficient vitamin D may help to prevent the onset of inflammatory diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.
However, for patients who already have rheumatoid arthritis, simply providing vitamin D might not be enough. Instead much higher doses may be needed.
The researchers analysed blood and joint fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients.
Vitamin D restores normal bowel habits
Researchers from the University of Sheffield analysed seven studies investigating a link between IBS and vitamin D.One trial found a womans bowel habits returned to near normal after a high dose of vitamin D, which eased her depression and anxiety.
Another investigation analysed 1,000 IBS patients and found 75 per cent had insufficient vitamin D levels.Looking at 37 blogs of IBS sufferers revealed 70 per cent reported benefiting from taking vitamin D.
The findings were published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition.Supplement may prevent type 1 diabetes
This comes after research published in October last year suggested vitamin D in childhood prevents type 1 diabetes.
The sunshine supplement lowers susceptible individuals risk by strengthening their immune system, the study found. Lead author Dr Jill Norris from the University of
Colorado, said: For several years there has been controversy among scientists about whether vitamin D lowers the risk of developing type 1 diabetes.
The researchers analyzed 8,676 children from the US and Europe with an elevated type 1 diabetes risk.

## Title: Disabled soldiers as a political tool

Disabled soldiers as a political tool
The Army has quite rightly taken exception to certain politically motivated elements engaging disabled War Heroes, or, their family members in street protests on the pretext of these disabled soldiers not been granted their dues by the government. Such acts are not only a slur on the army as a whole, which is held in almost reverence today by the populous for its role in securing the territorial integrity of the country, but is also demeaning, in that soldiers are known for their sacrifices made on behalf of the country rather than being supplicants, expecting benefits from the state. Fighting for ones country is reward enough, most would argue, though soldiers too have got to live and deserve all largess that the state could shower on them.
Army Headquarters, issuing a statement, says that most of the issues raised at these demonstrations had, indeed, been resolved to a large extent and regretted that some politically motivated elements, with vested interests, are found to be behind regularly organised street protests featuring disable War Heroes or their families. The insinuation is quite clear and the target unmistakable. The Joint Opposition has been shamelessly using these disabled War Heroes in its political project to enthrone the Rajapaksas in the seats of power, once again, and, it would stop at nothing, including manipulating the plight of disabled soldiers to achieve its vile ends.
The JO stalwarts are well aware that disabled soldiers strike an emotive chord with the larger populace and is exploiting these sentiments to the hilt. Like the army says, if the majority of the issues confronting these disabled soldiers have been resolved, one can only come to the conclusion that these hapless individuals are dragged onto the streets for no other reasons than political. What the JO intends is provoke a retaliation from the police, as happened recently, when teargas was fired at a group of protesting disabled soldiers, resulting in one of them being injured in the eye. The JO seized on the opportunity to parade this victim before the media, and, accused the government of deliberately unleashing the police on the War Heroes. That, this is a politically motivated exercise is also clear by the fact that a disabled soldier who is also a lawyer, is acting as a front man, espousing the cause of his colleagues, in unmistakable anti-government tones. He is often seen in the company of JO worthies at press conferences spewing venom at the government.
There are also many disabled soldiers, in the lineup of candidates contesting the upcoming local government elections, from the pohottuwa. It is strange for the JO to field such individuals after claiming that the general state of decay and disarray in the towns and villages, and, the chief reasons for the spread of dengue due to garbage accumulation was the absence of able bodied local councillors to attend to these matters, due to the non-holding of LG elections. How disabled soldiers will fit the bill to shoulder these tasks, only the likes Gammanpila and Weerawansa will be able to explain.
With LG elections only two weeks away, one cannot discount another bout of street protests by the disabled War Heroes, masterminded by the Rajapaksas, with a view to provoking police retaliation. The government ought to be alive to these machinations and issue the necessary instructions to the police against precipitate action. This is just what the JO is banking upon, so that its personages could weep buckets for the War Heroes, never mind that the foremost War Hero among them was unceremoniously thrown in the slammer by the Rajapaksas, with nary whimper made by the pro-Rajapaksa bikkhu brigade, who have today gone bananas over War Heroes.
Besides, the war ended in 2009 and, thus, all the issues faced by these disabled soldiers had been left unattended in the intervening period. What were those, now accusing the government of neglecting the War Heroes, doing then Where were these good Samaritans when our War Heroes were forced to man vegetable stalls and sweep the streets in the city It is time someone in the government expose these hypocrites, lest their conduct go by default.
In no other country in the world, has the army been used as a political tool, as done in sunny Sri Lanka. Similarly, in no other country has the military been given a clean bill of health, even in the face of the worst villainy, as in Sri Lanka. For the Weerawansas and Gammnapilas, the members of the security forces could do no wrong. Today, the newspapers are full of accounts of serving, or, ex-soldiers being involved in serious crime, such as murder, robbery and rape. When arrests are made, this constitutes a witch-hunt against the War Heroes, in the book of JO personages. While the nation is indebted to the valiant men who fought the enemy on the battlefield, and, protected the countrys sovereignty, it need not be emphasized that the law should take its normal course and applies to the armed forces too - War Heroes or otherwise.

Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja, a revolutionary film director
The news of the passage of cinemas stalwart Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja impacted on most of us with a benumbing shock.
For some time now, he was ailing but when we heard of his farewell to life we could not help but be shaken, because of the seeming abruptness of the end.
The good part of his life, turning 74 years, was spent in making films and an illuminating people on media issues as a communication Don and a general style-setter. In the 71 year history of indigenous cinema, his contribution to the medium could very well claim a whole chapter.
For his cinematic debut title Sathuro (Enemies), a short film done in 1970, to his finale offering Swarupa of 2017, a film adapted from Kafka, Pathiraja has been a by-word for a revolutionary cinema creativity.
In most of his pioneering work as a film director he proved an articulate cinematic tongue, for the masses who have no public life. He primed his emerging communication talents at the Monash University, Australia.
In parallel to his film creations, he functioned as an old academic in cinema and related disciplines. He explored characters that inhabit the work-a-day world of the unemployed and those who earn precarious living at the edge of formal society.
His Ahas Gawwa, Bambaru Avith, Soldadu Unnehe, are all inspired by the living and pulsating reality of lives of those whose existence is always lest unsung and unrecognized.
His social consciousness is reflected in such works as Eya den loku lamayek (She is grown up now). The major work of his final stage of creativity his Sakkaran adapted from an impressive work of fiction by Chaminda Welagedara. The underline theme depicts Pathirajas philosophy which emphasizes the socially underprivileged.
He is perhaps the only Sinhala film director to create a Tamil language cinematic work titled Ponmani. It touches social areas that are acutely sensitive.
In Pathiraja, we had an exceptionally proliferate cinematic genius who had the daring to step out the beaten track and explore social areas that should receive mass attention.His body of cinematic creations as already won acclaim and accolade when we say farewell to him, all lovers of art and culture should make a pledge that we will not allow his praiseworthy contribution to pass away from mass memory in to a cynical limbo.

EC raises concern over Feb. 8 house session
The Elections Commission has raised its concerns with Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe over the convening of Parliament on February 8 to debate the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report.
Election Commission member Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole said Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya expressed these concerns to the Speaker and the Prime Minister on Saturday afternoon.
Prof. Hoole pointed out that the period of silence, that is a cessation of all electioneering during the two days preceding the day of voting; namely,from midnight of February 7 to 8 should be adhered to according to guidelines and directions published by the Commission through the authority given to it by the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance in Section 76A which empowers the Elections Commission to, by Order published in the Gazette, issue all such directions as they may consider necessary where difficulties arise over the conduct or the elections process.
According to Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole, the elections may have to be postponed if the debate is held as planned on February 8. Presenting his views on the issue, Prof. Hoole said that the Local Government Elections may be postponed to February 12, or a later date, if Parliament convenes on February 8.
A debate would run counter to the law and may necessitate the Commission having to consider postponing the elections, he said adding that such a postponement is certainly within the powers of the Commission under Section 76A.
According to Prof. Hoole whether the elections will be postponed or not will depend on what the government does about the debate, and, if they go ahead, what we three members of the Commission decide to do about it.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Saturday announced that Parliament will be convened on February 8 to debate the Bond Commission report and other reports on serious fraud and corruption.
The Premier made this announcement at a public rally held in Morawaka, Deniyaya on Saturday.
February 8 was deemed as a suitable date as the Ministers and Parliamentarians who are currently engaged in election campaign process, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. He said the letter requesting for the parliament to be convened will be issued today.
COMMISSION WILL CLOSELY EXAMINE SITUATION
Amali Mallawaarachchi
All three Election Commissioners will examine the situation that may arise if the Parliamentary debate on the Bond Commission report and PRECIFAC report falls on the silent days prior to the Local Government elections, Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said yesterday. The Commission needs to sit and talk about this matter, Deshapriya observed.
We are yet to arrive at any decision on this.The main issue in this situation is the debate falling on the silent days, or else the Election Commission has nothing to do with this debate.
There are no legal concerns arising from this matter. I do not think we have any sort of power to overrule a decision taken by the Parliament if there would be any. he pointed out. He also said that the Commission has not yet been officially informed about the date of the debate as well. However, he said he inquired about the matter from Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
Chairman Deshapriya made these observations at a press brief held at the Election Commission last evening. Deshapriya also said if the election is to be postponed it would be for three weeks or more.
Accordingly, the three Commissioners of the Election Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya, Prof.Ratnajeevan Hoole and Presidents Counsel Nalin Abeysekara will sit for a round of discussions on the matter. The Commission members were to conduct an initial discussion on the matter yesterday evening over Skype as Election Commissioner Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole was in Jaffna. According to Deshapriya, another meeting will follow either on February 1 or 2. He observed that a party leaders meeting will have to precede their discussion if they are to arrive at any decision.
The Election Commission will do its level best to solve this troubled situation without causing harm to any party involved in this matter, including the public, political parties, media and the Election Commission. We have high hopes that the Local Government election will be held on February 10, Deshapriya said.
In a lighter vein, Deshapriya observed that the Commission is in a difficult situation to recommend or propose any suggestions over the matter at the moment. Now we are at a Gedara giyoth abu nasi, Maga hitiyoth tho nasi situation which can be loosely translated as (If I go home, I will be a victim of my wife, if I stay on the roads, some harm may come to me).
Asked what decisions he could take regarding this difficult situation, he displayed of signing and submitting a letter of resignation. That could be one of the decisions, he said, followed by laughter from those who were present at the brief.
However, at a later point of the press brief, he said it was just a humorous act and nothing serious.I wont leave unless it is a natural cause. I will do my level best to hold this election. he claimed.

Governors help sought to stop Sevanagala Sugar privatisation
Sevanagala Sugar Company unions met with Uva Province Governor, Attorney M.P. Jayasinghe and urged him to intervene against the privatisation of the company. The unions had written to the President in this regard and the Governor had been instructed to investigate the matter and submit a report.
During the meeting held at the auditorium of the Governors office, the unions noted that the Sevanagala Sugar Company had recorded significant profits during the period it was a state company, but its production had suffered a setback subsequent to it being privatised, which had a negative impact on the countrys sugar production.
However, they said the current Chairman and board of directors were committed to the uplift of the company which had resulted in the production capacity of Sevanagala Sugar increasing from 800 tons to 1,200 tons. They said that the company could be made productive again and it was currently in the process of paying back debts owed to the government.
Union members further said that they had held discussions with Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and Fisheries Minister Mahinda Amaraweera in this regard and they had assured them that Sevanagala Sugar Company would not be privatized.
The unions further noted that there are 974 workers employed at Sevanagala Sugar Company, with 200 tractor owners and 4,500 farmers and 2,000 indirectly employed. The total workforce is almost 8,000 and if their employment is to be secured, Sevanagala should remain under the government, the unions said.Uva Governors Secretary H.M. Somatillake, Uva Province Agriculture Ministerial Assistant Secretary R.B.N.R. Priyashantha, Secretary of Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya L.A. Kokila Chaminda and several other union members participated.

GSP, Indian expansions help Teejay Group recorded strong profits
Teejay Group recorded strong profits coupled with a YoY growth in profit before tax of 7% for the quarter, thereby delivering a marked swing in profit trend compared to the prior few quarters.
Revenue for the Group saw an increase of 5% for the period ending December 31, 2017, coupled with a solid order book situation. During the period the Group reported Rs. 6.6 billion revenue compared to Rs. 6.3 billion last year.
GSP concessions and Teejay Lanka operating in optimal capacity, coupled with early added volumes being done in India through capacity expansion, contributed towards the growth in revenue for the Group. The Group continued to be strong and profitable, and recorded a Net Profit of Rs 497 million compared to Rs 473 million last year for the same quarter.
The overhead management and cost control across the entire Group still strongly persists where we saw distribution expenses reduce by 16%. Administration costs on the other hand increased by 17% as a result of the expansion related expenses and structural changes that were carried out.
Taxes within the group increased 21% from Rs 79 million to 95 million, as result of improved profits and deferred tax assets that were converted to liabilities during the quarter.
As a result of Indias new Capacity coming into full swing, the Group will soon drive regional Solutions to its Customers to secure Teejays long term growth trajectory. The strategic direction for the group continues to remain unchanged in general as a result, said its Chairman, Bill Lam.

Hate speech precedes violence: CaFFE
Highlighting that hate speech is only a prelude to physical attacks/violence, the Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) urged the authorities to take immediate action to end the systematic hate speech campaign against female Muslim candidates of the forthcoming local government elections.
The organisation has consulted with the Commission of Elections and will take action against certain Muslim clerics who have been carrying out the systematic campaign.
The CaFFE has been calling for a mandatory quota for female candidates since its inception, and we were extremely jubilant of the new laws enforcing this mandate. If immediate action is not taken against these reactionary elements, these laws will have no impact and efforts by numerous groups, for decades, will be for naught, CaFFE Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said.
He said that while the CaFFE opposes any efforts to discourage female political participation and in a number of Muslim majority countries, women hold a high proportion of seats in national parliaments. For example, 28 percent in Afghanistan, 26 percent in Algeria, 20 percent in Bangladesh, 20 percent in Indonesia and 21 percent in Pakistan. So someone cant just say its against the religion, he said.
This campaign against women have been brought to CaFFEs attention when the organisation was conducting workshops, seminars and training sessions for female candidates contesting for the February 10 Local Council Elections.
During our sessions in the North Western and Eastern Provinces, a number of female candidates, grass roots female activists and community leaders have informed us that there is a systematic campaign to demoralise, dehumanise and discredit female candidates by certain Muslim clerics attached to controversial organisations which are bent on damaging reconciliation and ethnic harmony, he said.
A number of female candidates have informed the CaFFE that these attacks, which aim to tarnish their reputations within the communities they live in, have greatly demoralised them and that they fear for their safety. The CaFFE informed these developments to political parties, the police and civil society organisations that work in these areas about these alarming developments.
The CaFFE has been monitoring Sri Lankan elections since 2008 and in our experience, verbal abuse/hate speech is only a prelude to physical attacks/violence. If female candidates, especially Muslim female candidates, are assaulted or are intimidated, no one except those from political families will come forth to contest in coming elections, he said.

How am I feeling Ask my house
Someday a health checkup may be as easy as switching on the living room light.
In early 2016, researchers from Kyoto Universitys Center of Innovation and Panasonic Corporation developed a radar-based device that could instantaneously and accurately measure the bodys vital signals - and now theyve made it even better.
The sensor combined a radar with signal analysis algorithms to measure how the body moves as the heart beats. Body movements vary considerably, so the software filters isolate just the hearts minute motions.
Measuring respiration and heart rate - without attaching cumbersome wires to the body - will greatly benefit modern medicine and home healthcare, explains Toru Sato, lead researcher and Kyoto University professor of communications and computer engineering.
Moreover, it will reduce stress by not subjecting the individual to a feeling of being monitored.
While the original technology showed promise, there was a major problem: the prototype was the size of a microwave oven. To improve prospects for implementation, the group shifted their focus toward refining the device.
After extensive testing we achieved great improvements, continues Sato. The device now utilizes the 79 GHz frequency band, instead of the previous 60 GHz. We also incorporated CMOS semiconductors. As a result, range and resolution improved, and its now only about one tenth the size - as big as a smoke detector.
Moreover, because of the new frequency band, the sensor can now measure the heart rates of multiple individuals in the same room, separated by as little as 7.5 cm (about 3 inches).
The team hopes that the improved specs will allow such sensors to be installed in a variety of household appliances - such as lighting - to safely monitor the vitals of residents.
This technology holds great promise for the future development of devices to monitor health remotely, concludes Sato.
We are currently considering test sites for observing the multiple applications of our sensor.

I want a government free of corruption: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said he wants a government free of bribery and corruption, and if all 96 members elected to Parliament from the SLFP led UPFA at the 2015 General Election stand by him, he was willing to form a SLFP government.
The President was addressing an election rally held at Ratnapura in support of UPFA candidates contesting the Local Government elections from the Ratnapura district.
"I am opposed to bribery, corruption and family bandyism. I will appoint commissions to probe bribery and corruption and take legal action against those found guilty irrespective of their standing or party affiliations," the President said.
The rally was organised under the directions of Labour, Trade Unions and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne.
The President said he appointed a commission to probe the Central Bank Bond issue from 2008 to 2016 and obtained a report. People involved both in the government and opposition made a hue and cry demanding the report be tabled in Parliament. But those demanded were maintaining stoic silence after it was tabled in Parliament. He would request them to reconvene Parliament and debate that report prior to the Local Government elections if possible.
He was certain that some of those clamouring for a debate would be stripped politically if the debate was taken up in Parliament.
The President said the question posed by many was what the government had done after assuming power three years ago. The government has accomplished many things, while there were also many things that ought to be done. The people were quite unaware that our country was relegated to the back seat by the International Community at the time the government assumed power, he said.
"Only a handful among the 194 nations in the United Nations supported us then. But today the government was able to make a complete turn around and win the confidence of the international world.
Today there are no talks on political platforms about the possibility of hauling our war heroes before the International Military Court and sending them to the electric chair if found guilty. Earlier there was a possibility of our country being subjected to economic sanctions," the President said.
The President said the country has no threats since the two major parties had joined hands to form a consensus government and take the country along a new path.
The government had abolished the draconian 18th Amendment by introducing the 19th Amendment paving the way for independent commissions, he said.
"Although some members of the opposition alleged that the government ill-treated War Heroes, it was they who caused grave injustice to War Heroes by selling the six acres of land in Colombo belonging to the Army Headquarters to a Chinese hotel chain to build a hotel. Today, the military headquarters and offices of the higher echelons of the Army were scattered in various places on rented buildings causing enormous cost to the government," the President said.
Who was responsible for giving out the Port City area on a 99-year lease to the Chinese the President asked.

India have retained the ICC Test Championship mace and have also won an award of $1million after their victory in the Johannesburg Test ensured that South Africa cannot move ahead of them in the MRF Tyres ICC Test Team Rankings at the 3 April cut-off date, even if they go on to win all four Tests against Australia in March.
India had arrived in South Africa on 124 points, with South Africa 13 points behind on 111 points. However, Virat Kohlis men will return on 121 points as opposed to South Africas 115 points, which will be good enough for them to keep possession of the prestigious ICC Test Championship mace for the second year in succession at the April cut-off.
Kohli will be presented with the mace, which is a symbol of excellence and a recognition of a sides outstanding performance in the purest format of the game, and a cheque of $1million in a presentation ceremony, the details of which will be announced in due course.
Kohli had become the 10th captain since 2002 to get his hands on the mace when he had received it from Sunil Gavaskar following the Indore Test against New Zealand in 2016.

Having triumphantly completed its first five years in the industry, Arpico Insurance has won the award for the Fastest Growing Life Insurance Company in Sri Lanka for 2017 in its sixth year of operations.
Arpico Insurance PLC was incorporated as a Public Limited Company in 2011, and received the license as a Life Insurer in the same year by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka primarily providing life insurances. The company reached a GWP of Rs. 100 mn within the first year of its commercial operations.
It was the Group Chairman, Dr. Sena Yaddehiges visionary leadership thinking that made the group venture into the insurance business in 2011. He saw life insurance as a social need and had the objective of offering an affordable insurance solution for Sri Lankans with living benefits, and making it accessible to a wider audience through a network of branches. With his guidance Arpico Insurance PLC has performed successfully in the insurance business and has been awarded outstanding titles.
"Our company is built on values which are its pillars of strength and the force behind its success. As a growing insurer, we believe that it's important to be unequivocally ethical and authentic in all our actions," said Acting Chairman Viville Perera as mentioned in the company's Annual Report 2016.

Just ONE egg a day for six months!
Feeding babies eggs boosts their brain development and function, new research suggests.
Just one egg a day for six months significantly increases youngsters levels of the nutrients choline and DHA, both of which are involved in brain health, a study found.
Previous research reveals feeding babies eggs improves their growth and prevents stunting.
Lead author Lora Iannotti from the Brown School at Washington University, said: Like milk or seeds, eggs are designed to support the early growth and development of an organism and are, therefore, dense in nutrient content.
Eggs provide essential fatty acids, proteins, choline, vitamins A and B12, selenium, and other critical nutrients at levels above or comparable to those found in other animal food products, but they are relatively more affordable.
The researchers analyzed 163 babies aged between six and nine months from Ecuador in 2015.
Of the infants, 80 were fed one egg a day for six months, while the remainder were given none.
Their vitamin and mineral levels were assessed via blood tests.
Results reveal babies who eat eggs have significantly higher levels of choline and DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, both of which play a vital role in brain development and function.
Iannotti said: Eggs have been consumed throughout human history, but the full potential of this nutritionally-complete food has yet to be recognized in many resource-poor settings around the world.

Kabul ambulance bomb kills over 100
AFGHANISTAN: An explosives-packed ambulance blew up in a crowded area of Kabul on Saturday, killing 103 people and wounding 235 others, officials said, in one of the biggest blasts to rock the war-torn city in recent years.
The Taliban-claimed assault -- the second carried out by the militant group in the Afghan capital in a week -- triggered chaotic scenes as terrified survivors fled the area scattered with body parts, blood and debris, and hospitals were overwhelmed by the large number of wounded.
It came as both the insurgents and the Islamic State group have escalated their attacks on Kabul, one of the deadliest places in Afghanistan for civilians.
An AFP reporter saw lots of dead and wounded civilians in the Jamuriate hospital, which is metres away from the blast and where medical staff struggled to treat the bloodied men, women and children lying on the floor in corridors.
Health ministry spokesman Waheed Majroh told AFP that the toll now stands at 95 dead, 158 wounded, shortly after the interior ministry warned that an earlier death toll of 63 could rise.
The blast happened in an area where several high-profile organisations, including the European Union, have offices. Members of the EU delegation in Kabul were in their safe room and there were no casualties, an official told AFP.
The force of the explosion shook windows of buildings at least two kilometres (more than a mile) away and caused some low-rise structures in the immediate vicinity to collapse.
The suicide bomber passed through at least one checkpoint in the ambulance, saying he was taking a patient to Jamuriate hospital, an interior ministry spokesman told AFP.
At the second checkpoint he was recognised and blew his explosive-laden car, Nasrat Rahimi said.
Rahimi told a news conference that most of the victims were civilians. He said the Taliban-affiliated Haqqani Network was responsible and four suspects had been arrested.
Twenty minutes before the blast an AFP reporter saw police checking ambulances several hundred metres from the scene of the explosion, as the drivers and patients stood on the street. Ambulances are rarely checked in the city.
The International Committee of the Red Cross in Afghanistan condemned the use of an ambulance in the bombing, saying on Twitter it was unacceptable and unjustifiable.
The Taliban used social media to claim responsibility for the attack, which comes exactly a week after its insurgents stormed Kabuls landmark Intercontinental hotel, killing at least 25 people, the majority foreigners.
Photos shared on social media purportedly of the blast -- the deadliest in Kabul since a truck bomb ripped through the citys diplomatic quarter on May 31, killing 150 people and wounding hundreds -- showed a huge plume of smoke rising into the sky.
Near the blast site civilians walked through debris-covered streets carrying wounded on their backs as others loaded several bodies at a time into ambulances and private cars to take them to medical facilities around the city.
The Italian NGO Emergency said 235 wounded had been taken to its hospital, with its coordinator Dejan Panic tweeting that it had been a massacre.
A photo posted on Emergencys Twitter account showed hospital staff treating injured people in an outdoor walkway next to a garden.
A man told Ariana TV he had taken his wounded brother to Jamuriate and Emergency hospitals but had been turned away.
They are asking people with non-life threatening wounds to go to other hospitals, he said.
Aminullah, whose stationery shop is just metres from where the explosion happened, said the force of the explosion shook the foundations of his building.
The building shook. All our windows broke.
The people are in shock in our market, he told AFP.
A man told Tolo News he was passing the area when the explosion happened.
I heard a big bang and I fainted, he said, outside the Emergency hospital.
There were dozens of people who were killed and wounded. There were pools of blood.
The attack was condemned by the presidential palace as a crime against humanity. There was international outcry too, with NATO, the US embassy in Kabul and British foreign minister Boris Johnson among those expressing horror at the latest attack.
The offices of the High Peace Council, charged with negotiating with the Taliban which has been waging a more than 16-year insurgency in the war-torn country, are also near the blast site.
It targeted our checkpoint. It was really huge -- all our windows are broken, Hassina Safi, a member of High Peace Council, told AFP.
So far we dont have any reports if any of our members are wounded or killed.
A security alert issued on Saturday morning had warned that the Islamic State group was planning to conduct aggressive attacks on supermarkets, shops and hotels frequented by foreigners. - AFP

Heavy gunfire and explosions have been heard at a military academy in the Afghan capital, Kabul.
The Marshal Fahim National Defense University came under attack early Monday morning, reports said.
It comes days after the deadliest bombing for months hit Kabulwhen an ambulance packed with explosives killed at least 100 people.
Islamic State and the Taliban have recently carried out attacks in the city.
Several explosions were heard, as well as small arms fire, as the attack began at about 05:00 local time (00:30 GMT), the BBC's Mahfouz Zubaide reported from Kabul.
Security forces have blocked off all roads in the area, Afghan media outlet Tolo said.
News agency AFP is citing a police spokesman confirming rocket and gunfire but saying it was now calm.
There have been no reports of casualties so far.
The ambulance attack on Saturday, took place just one week afteranother attack on a Kabul hotel killed 22 people - mostly foreigners. The Taliban said it had carried out both attacks.
Afghan military institutions are frequently targeted by militants.
In October 2017,15 military cadets were killed in an explosion outside the Marshal Fahim military academy, which is located west of the Kabul city centre.

Kohli hails India triumph as massive milestone
JOHANNESBURG, Saturday  Captain Virat Kohli described Saturdays 63-run win over South Africa in the third and final Test at the Wanderers as a massive milestone for Indian cricket.
This is one of our sweetest wins, he said. This day will be remembered for a long time for us as a team.
Kohli said India's performance on a pitch designed to help South Africa's fast bowlers showed they could win in any conditions.
We already had the belief but now we have the result to back that as well. He said belief in their own ability was crucial.
If we think about winning Test matches, yes, we will lose some but we will end up winning a lot as well.
Kohli added Saturday's win, achieved on the fourth afternoon after South Africa lost their last nine wickets for 53 runs, ranked as one of the finest he had been involved in as a player.
He compared it to a win under Mahendra Singh Dhonis captaincy against England at Lords in 2014. Lords was very special because we were playing on a similar sort of pitch, he said.
Asked whether he was concerned that South Africa were taking control during a second wicket stand of 119 between Dean Elgar and Hashim Amla, which took the hosts to within 117 runs of their victory target of 241, Kohli said: I dont think like people on the outside, adding that he knew that if one wicket fell it could lead to a collapse on a difficult pitch.
The win entrenched India as the world's number one Test team. If South Africa had completed a 3-0 series sweep they would have drawn level on points with Kohli's men. South Africa played better than us in the first two games so they deserved to win (the series) but we deserved to win this game. But at many moments in the first two games we put them under pressure, added Kohli. We are the number one team in the world and we certainly played like that today.
South Africa captain Faf du Plessis admitted that India had been the better team at the Wanderers but hailed the series win.
Its fantastic to win the series against a really good team. Credit to India for playing some really good cricket in all three Tests.
Du Plessis praised the effort of Elgar, who was struck on the helmet on Friday in an incident which led to the umpires and match referee deciding to call off play, leading to concerns that the match could become only the third Test ever to be abandoned.
Elgar battled for almost six hours, facing 240 balls, to make 86 not out. He became the first South African to carry his bat twice through a Test innings.
Hes our little bulldog, said Du Plessis.  AFP

Lanka records highest ever US$ 1.63 bn FDI in 2017
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Sri Lanka in 2017 increased to US$ 1.63 billion, doubling from the US$ 802 million achieved the previous year.
The Board of Investment (BOI), the agency tasked with promoting and facilitating FDI, reported that US$ 1.63 billion has been received in 2017, which is the highest ever surpassing the US$ 1.61 billion in 2014, with solid growth across key sectors.
Duminda Ariyasinghe
The strong growth is a direct consequence of the Governments reorientation of economic policy towards investment and export driven growth, rather than debt-funded public infrastructure spending. Among the highest growth sectors were export-oriented manufacturing (+27%) and services which included tourism, IT (+50%) and infrastructure (+190%). The highest FDI came from China, followed by Hong Kong, India and Singapore.
The BOI, under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, is the first point of contact for foreign investors into the country. The outstanding FDI results have been achieved due to the hard work, talent and dedication of our investment promotion and facilitation teams as well as the pro-investor policy framework of the government to support both local and foreign investors, BOI Director General Duminda Ariyasinghe said.
Over the past two years, the BOI has targeted both new investors, leveraging the countrys strengths and advantages, as well utilizing existing investors to increase reinvestments and to utilize their external networks to bring in new investors in sectors such as export-oriented manufacturing.
The agency has focused on fast and transparent decision-making utilizing two high level committees appointed by the Prime Minister that provides approvals as well as accelerated operational clearances.
Ariyasinghe said the BOI has embarked on several new initiatives including a virtual One Stop Shop for investment facilitation with 24 government agencies which will come into operation this year to strengthen the approval and executional mechanisms. The support and guidance from our Chairman and the Board of Directors has been a strength to us in achieving these strong results.
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama said that while Sri Lanka has achieved strong FDI results in 2017, the country has only scratched the surface of its full potential. This is not a time for complacency but renewed focus to use the momentum to strengthen reforms to improve our Ease of Doing Business ranking, and efforts to attract high-quality investors from countries we have renewed bilateral relationships with.
The Minister said the countrys target was to achieve US$ 5 billion in FDI by 2020. Samarawickrama said he was confident of achieving US$ 2.5 billion of FDI this year. In order to facilitate FDI, the new Inland Revenue Act provides accelerated investment allowances over and above normal depreciation until companies recover their total fixed investment. The foreign exchange regime too has been liberalized to improve the investment climate via the new Foreign Exchange Act.
The BOI has initiated work on developing several new export promotion zones including Milleniya, Bingiriya, Weligama and Mawatagama. These will be the first comprehensive BOI zones to be developed since 2000.

Farewell to dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja
But the legacy lives on
He has often been dubbed as a rebel with a cause and an enfant terrible during the height of his career in the 1970s. The pioneer of Sri Lankan cinemas second revolution film director and screenwriter Dr. Dharmasena Pathiraja, known fondly as Pathi among his contemporaries, passed away yesterday while undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Kandy. He was 74 at the time of his demise.
Pathiraja was renowned for the films he made during the 1970s - a particularly chaotic period for social change. He was one of the prominent figures in the arts scene who vied to challenge the existing social order via his medium  cinema.
Starting off his cinematic stint with the 10 minute short film Saturo in 1970, Pathiraja carved a niche for himself for making movies which focused on the realistic film realm  the alienation of underclass youth in post colonial political setting. One League Of Sky (Ahas Gawwa) followed four years after Sathuro. The film dealt with the urban lower class and was a typical of most commercial films of that period. It was critically well-received, sweeping the FCJAC Awards by winning the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor awards. It also clinched the Office Catholique Internationale Du Cinema (Sri Lanka) awards for Best Film and Best Director.
Pathiraja regards his films as social commentaries. They are critical of attitudes wrought by the social and political circumstances of the era. They are also sympathetic to the humanistic dilemmas that beset them. Since he has studied the cinema of radical activists like Jean-Luc Godard, Third Cinema filmmakers like Fernando Solanas and Glauber Rocha, and Asians like Mrinal Sen, Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak, Pathiraja was able to weave together visual, narrative and ideological motifs in a complex and extraordinary manner. He moved away from bourgeois idealism towards a socially engaged and critically humanist cinema. It is said that this approach influenced the next generation of filmmakers like Prasanna Vithanage and Asoka Handagama who lead the countrys third cinematic revolution.
Pathirajas Eya Dan Loku Lamayek was Sri Lankas entry at the ninth Moscow International Film Festival in 1975. It won a Special Diploma for Female Performance in 1976 and the Special award from the peace council of the USSR to be screened at the 18th Venice Film Festival in Bergamo, Italy.
Bambaru Avith is widely considered as his masterpiece. It represented Sri Lanka at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival and was screened at the Venice and Los Angeles Film Festivals. It won the Presidential Film Awards and the OCIC Awards for Best Director and Best Film. It was named the fourth best Sri Lankan film of all-time by a special council selected to celebrate 50 years of Sri Lankan cinema in 1997. Ponmani (A Tamil film-1977), Paara Dige (1980), Soldadu Unnehe (1981), Waasuli, Sira Kandaura, Shelton Haa Kanthi (Destroyed during ethnic riots in 1983), Swaroopa, Sakkarang and In Search of a Road (documentary - 2006) are some of his other cinematic creations. Ella Langa Walawwa, Maaya Mandira, Gangulen Egodata and Nadunana Putheku are some of his renowned teledramas.
An old boy of Dharmaraja College, Kandy, Pathiraja has graduated with an honours degree in Sinhala and Western Classical Culture at Peradeniya University in 1967. Later he completed his PhD in Bengali cinema from Monash University, Australia.
Pathiraja produced around 30 documentaries on professional Umatic and betacam formats for national and international organisations including the United Nations during his time. Some have won both national and international awards.
The 15-minute documentary Punaravarthana (Rejuvenation), made for the United Nations Environmental Program won the Bronze award at the 15th International Agricultural Film festival, West Berlin, in 1988.
He also directed the stage plays like The Lame and the Blind (Kora Saha Andhaya)  the first Sinhala play translated into French and published in L Avent Scene in 1975, Paris. Chairs (Putu) which won the State Award for Best Translation produced in 1971 State Drama Festival, and Birds (Kurullo) are two of his other stage dramas. He has also worked as a lecturer in Drama and Performing Arts for a span.

Liverpool knocked out of FA Cup by West Brom after VAR chaos
LIVERPOOL, Saturday - Jay Rodriguez scored twice as West Brom knocked Premier League rivals Liverpool out of the FA Cup with a 3-2 win at Anfield on Saturday in a tie overshadowed by the use of the Video Assistant Referee.
A remarkable first half on Merseyside saw West Brom go 2-1 up inside 11 minutes against seven-times FA Cup winners Liverpool only to have a goal chalked off by VAR before, in a subsequent incident on the stroke of half-time, the system confirmed they had gone 3-1 ahead via Joel Matip's own-goal.
In between, Liverpool were awarded a penalty after a prolonged VAR review only for Roberto Firmino's spot-kick to come back off the crossbar.
The build up to the penalty decision saw Craig Pawson become the first English referee to consult a pitchside replay, with players and fans angry over the four-minute delay from the time Mohamed Salah fell in the box to the award of a spot-kick.
Salah's first FA Cup goal, his 25th goal in just 32 appearances for the Reds, gave Liverpool hope of a comeback but the Baggies held on for a deserved fourth-round win that took them into the last 16.  AFP

Local government polls: a guide to the new electoral system
Handing out leaflets, knocking on doors, holding meetings and driving around in vans fitted with loudspeakers, announcing to the world why they alone need your vote. These have become a common sight as the local government elections get closer.
With the introduction of new electoral system for the polls, voters are confused with regard to how the system would work. The new mixed electoral system consisting of the proportional representation system and the first-past-the-post system has many ask the question of how this would translate onto a ballot paper.
New electoral system
The local government authority (LGA) is the most important institution which can cater to local needs according to the tastes of its people and thus it is an important start to any politicians career and thus February 10 will be a hard fought battle for all.
Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils' Legal Officer Gayani Premathilake said the new system would help voters appoint someone from their own ward and thus make government more familiar to the people.
She further said the new system would, to a great extent, ensure a corruption-free local government system.
At the time of gaining Independence in 1948, there were four types off local government institutions as municipal councils, urban councils, town councils and village councils and these were governed by a system known as the first-past-the-post system.
A preferential voting system with a proportional representation system was introduced by the 1978 Constitution. Thereafter, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was introduced to grant more powers to local bodies - this done under Indian influence was seen as a solution to the ethnic problem in the country. The constitutional change introduced the provincial council system.
As of November 2017, there are 341 local authorities (24 municipal councils, 41 urban councils, 276 divisional councils).
Law related to new system
The new election system was introduced by Local Government Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act No. 16 of 2017 and the total number of members of local authority at ward level was determined by the National Delimitation Commission (NDC).
It is expected to be the largest election in Sri Lankan history and will be the first time elections to all local authorities are held on the same day. These will also be the first elections under the mixed electoral system, whereby 60 percent of members represent single-member or multi-member wards and 40 percent are returned from a list called additional persons list without a ward-based continuance.
Two nomination papers have been submitted, one comprises the number of candidates equivalent to 60 percent of the total number of members of LGA and the other comprises the number of persons as equivalent to 40 percent of the total number of members of the local authority plus three additional names.
Candidates under the first nomination paper will contest and are entitled to be elected as members of local authority and persons under the second nomination paper are entitled to return as members of that LGA based on the number of seats their party wins.
In the meantime, the total number of members in local government has been increased from 4,486 to around 8,356 members. According to Section 27F of the Amendment, 25 percent of the total number of members in each local authority have to be women. Note that this does not mean that 25 percent of the elected members of every party must be women. This is an overall percentage for the LG body.
When contesting, the Local Authorities Elections (Amendment) Act passed on August 25, 2017, decreed that 10 percent of the members assigned to a ward be women and 50 percent of members on the additional persons list be women. The 50 percent on the additional list will only enter the LG body depending on the number of votes their respective party wins.
Counting votes
The voter, this time around, only needs to cast a single vote for his or her party of choice at the ward level. He or she will not be required to choose a candidate of choice.
At the conclusion of the elections, the Elections Commission will, through a complex system, determine how many seats each party should be allocated based on the votes cast.
Therefore, the Commissioner must first determine the number of votes required for entitlement of a member. This is computed by dividing the total number of votes received by all parties and independent groups by the prescribed number of members of each local authority (this number is gazetted). The total number of votes received by each political party or independent group is then divided by the number of votes required for entitlement of a member to ascertain the number of members elected by each party.
Explaining the division of number of members among political parties and independent groups, Premathilake said that the votes received by all political and independent groups (prescribed number of members for that LGA) is required to be entitled as a member of the Local Government Authority.
She further explained that the number of members that could be entitled would depend on the number of votes received by each party within that LGA.
In case a party has secured more wards than the number of members they are entitled to, there are provisions to elect those candidates also as members of that LGA. Law introduced to this situation is known as an overhang. And if the party has secured less wards than the number of members they are entitled to, those number of members (shortfalls) can be returned by the respective secretary of the recognized political party, she said.
Womens representation
The Commissioner of Elections is required to ensure 25 percent womens representation in terms of Section 27F and Sub Sections 3 and 4 of Section 65 AA of the act.
According to Head of Media Research at Verite Research, the bill perceived to have addressed two problems of the existing electoral system and they are the twin problems of discipline and diversity.
She said that the problem of discipline was expected to be addressed by reforming the electoral system with a mixed system and the problem of diversity was expected to be addressed by including womens representation to a minimum of 25 percent.
Premathilake said that the Local Government Act amendment in 2016 ensured 25 percent compulsory womens representation in LG bodies.
This election in a way has given the voter less of a choice, we cannot choose the candidate for our ward as we simply vote for the party, but it has also made it easier for those with fewer means to contest. Further it has removed intra-party competition, making the process more peaceful and less violent. Despite the laws and systems however, whether an electoral system works or not can only be discerned through experience and its impacts will only be felt as the nation wakes up to a new democracy on February 11.

Losing waters
Local authorities have warned its 4 million inhabitants that if they do not reduce consumption by day zero  April 12 they will have to queue at 200 standpipes for daily rations of 25 litres (6.6 US gallons) due to the worst drought to hit South Africas second city in almost a century.
Farmers have been asked to cut back on irrigation, car hire firms have stopped washing cars, hotels have restricted all uses of water, while tourists in self-catering accommodation have been asked to restrict personal washing. Discussions are under way with the South African armed forces to enable water to be stored on military bases.
The full impact of a major global city losing its piped potable water supply is unknown.
Reservoirs around Cape Town, in the grip of its worst drought for a century, have gone largely unreplenished for more than three years in the absence of significant rainfall and are about to run dry.
Queues are forming at natural springs around the city as residents seek to minimise main usage and build up emergency supplies.
Much of Southern Africa recovered from a drought induced by the El Nio weather phenomenon after heavy rain in the summer. But Cape Town receives most of its rain in the southern hemispheres winter  and scientists say there is no guarantee of a good rainy season.
Many of Cape Towns wealthier residents will be able to leave the city to stay with relatives or friends elsewhere, or even travel abroad.
No such option exists for the millions living in the citys sprawling poorer neighbourhoods.
A range of factors is thought to have aggravated the drought, including a surging population and economic development, poor long-term planning, limited investment in water management, and invasive thirsty species.
Cape Town is quite used to surviving dry years. Water restrictions get it through and then dams refill, thanks to the wet years that follow. But this time its different. Never in recorded history has Cape Town encountered a drought of such severity for three consecutive years.
What do long-term data reveal about Cape Towns water shortage
The origins of the settlement that became known as Cape Town are intimately tied to water.
As the areas indigenous inhabitants had undoubtedly done, main reasons for choosing this area to settle was the ample supply of fresh water, running from a network of springs and streams around Table Mountain.
It did not take long, however, before the settlement started experiencing water shortages and pollution problems. As early as 1655 instructions were broadcast to minimise the pollution of a water supply that was used both by residents and by ships calling at Table Bay.
By the 1850s, the first major interventions had been built in the form of two reservoirs, still in use, that can be seen in De Waal Park.
Looking back over the history of Cape Town and the surrounds, one can see a series of management interventions evolving into the modern-day intricate network of water supply called the Western Cape Water Supply System (WCWSS). Over time, the little VOC refreshment station with its network of grachts (canals) developed into a complex regional network that integrates the City of Cape Town, the West Coast District Municipality as well as the Swartland, Saldanha Bay, Bergrivier and Stellenbosch Local Municipalities.
On the demand side, it is estimated that approximately 70% of water in the WCWSS gets allocated to urban and industrial users and 30% to agriculture.
Relevance to Sri Lanka
This article shows the frightening consequences if a water shortage affects a major city. An honest assessment with recommendations for the establishment of a Water Security Council in Sri Lanka has been languishing for the past few years.
Weather patterns are changing around the world with catastrophic consequences.
Urbanization is rapid and on-going. We do not want a situation similar to that of Cape Town.
The remedy is at hand. We must act and with foresight in the manner set out for the Cabinet paper awaiting attention.

Missed you at Christmas
You were the morning star that touched my life.Innocent and trusting, creating joy of life.Full of love and lasting bondageTo what lay ahead which you announcedAnd became a decade that we both knewBuilt on pillars of strength 
You were the joyous melody of SPRINGAnd rays of glow in golden SUMMERWatched the falling leaves of AUTUMNAnd wiped the cruel bite of WINTER
Left alone, I dream day and nightEmpty vision merging restless nightsI hear your soft moans trailing meAs emptiness greet me everywherePrecious SCAMPI, you still are my worldWhere memories abide, now and ever.
Flowers keep blooming tho I am sadAs mist gives way to each new morn.The same birds chirp atop the treesLooked for their precious friendTo find a void benath the trees.As Christmas winds chilled the air.
I was richer with your abiding loveThat I found in your gentle tender eyes.They told me an amazing wondrous storyThat words could never write.But you are gone my precious childStealing happiness from my life.
The ache in my heart kept swellingAs joyous Christmas bells peeledAnd knew you were not there to hear them ring.And share the hymns of love and peace.Yet, your loving memories lingerAs fresh as the bright morning star
My world fall short of what I wish to sayHow sad and lonely I was on Christmas dayWhen joyful tidings spread upon the earthAnd you were not there to share it with meBut wherever you are my eternal friend,Happy Christmas: SCAMPI

More FDI should come to Jaffna - Minister Gamage
The Sri Lanka public sector is heavily loaded with unwanted staff and this is a huge burden to the State said Minister of Primary Industries Daya Gamage.
Speaking at the inauguration of the ninth edition of Jaffna International Trade Fair he said that when compared to India, which has one public servant for every 1,000 of its population, Sri Lanka has public servants which are one-fifth of its total population.
They include one million who were recruited during the previous regime, he noted.
Minister Gamage also appreciated the efforts by the Northern people to uplift their lives and said his Primary Industries Ministry has made many plans to develop Jaffna and other districts in the province.
State Minister however mentioned that the governments efforts have been insufficient, in getting private sector contributions towards starting enterprises in Jaffna. More FDI should come to Jaffna, he said.
The Minister said that his Ministry has launched several programs which include distribution of five million TEJC mango plants, ensuring a market for cinnamon, pepper, turmeric and other spices and assisting in the development of the fisheries sector.
He said that this year the exhibition organized by Lanka Exhibitors (LECS) has attracted a 72 member delegation from India and the Northern entrepreneurs should try to woo them to invest in the North- East and also look at sharing the Indian technology by way of joint ventures.
Technology and investments should be derived from Indian entrepreneurs visiting the event, he noted.
Gamage said the exhibition has also given an ideal opportunity for entrepreneurs to kick start their business in the North.

## Title: National Chamber calls for  strategy for labour shortage

National Chamber calls for  strategy for labour shortage
The National Chamber called for a strategy for labour shortage at the 59th AGM held recently in Colombo. Excerpts of the speech of reelected President of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, Sujeeve Samaraweera.
As per the World Bank assessments, Sri Lankas economic performance remained broadly satisfactory in 2016 and early 2017 although recent floods and drought adversely affected macroeconomic performance.
The government is more focused on bringing fiscal reforms, improving public financial management, increasing public and private investments, addressing infrastructure constraints and improving competitiveness which is admirable. New directions taken on green growth opportunities, environmental management and women inclusion will lead the country to internationally accepted norms.
Sri Lanka being a lower middle-income country with 21.2 million population with per capita GDP in 2016 of $3,835, the economy is transitioning from being predominantly rural-based to urbanized economy oriented around manufacturing and services. The economy has been growing at a moderate phase of around 4% during the last three years, where the expectations of the business community are at higher levels.
It is worth mentioning that in 2016 Sri Lanka was hit with the worst drought in four decades that continued into 2017. In May 2017, Sri Lanka experienced one of the worst floods in 14 years, where agri and industry sectors facing more difficulties.
As Sri Lanka aspires to become a higher middle-income country, it will need to adjust its development model and economic growth which will likely require continued structural changes towards greater diversification and productivity increases. Although Sri Lanka has excelled in overcoming human development challenges, typical to a low-income country, its service delivery systems in education, health and other areas must now adjust to face new and changing demands of a middle income country. To accommodate these increasing demands, the government needs to increase fiscal revenues in the medium term.
Country to transits to a more robust, competitive, and globally integrated economy and create better-paying private-sector jobs, we need to distribute the benefits of the countrys growth to all citizens and increase female labor force participation through education. Boosting Green Growth, Improving Environmental Management, and mitigating Natural Disasters and the Effect of Climate Change is also a priority.
SME Development 
Just like in other economies, in Sri Lanka the main driving force of the economy is considered to be SMEs. Approximately 75% of the enterprises in the country can be classified as SMEs and they provide approximately 40% of the employment in the country in diversified sectors ensuring inclusive growth. It is noted that many SMEs do not use latest technology and having limited access to finance due to collaterals not being available. Further, SMEs are not directly connected to markets especially in the case of exports.
Our chamber is very much involved in SME activities and carries out many programs to assist the small and medium entrepreneurs to develop their business and skills and knowledge.
Small and Medium Enterprises play a significant part and contribution to most of the economies of the world. There are ample opportunities and exposure for large corporates in Sri Lanka and outside. They have the capital, technology and markets to survive and sustain.
It is a prime requirement today to support small and medium enterprises, and we must not forget startups and micro businesses, they will eventually grow bigger. Chambers together, with government development agencies and financial institutions should have a common development strategy for micro, small and medium entrepreneurs. We should continue to encourage entrepreneurship in this country.
SMEs are facing many difficulties and challenges in accessing international markets. It is an internationally accepted norm that policy level corrections are needed to ensure SMEs enter and continue to be in international trade. SMEs find it difficult to deal with regulatory processes associated with trading goods across borders. Recent studies have confirmed that reduction of complex border procedures will encourage SMEs to partake in more and more export/import activities.
Through the National budget proposals the government is proposing to setup a Development Bank to support the financial needs of the SME Sector and a SME guarantee fund also to be established which is expected to expand borrowing capacity of SMEs.
The development projects proposed by the government for Kandy, Galle, Anuradhapura and Jaffna would bring in economic benefits for regions. It would provide much needed equal development opportunities for the regions and would help establish National Reconciliation in the country as well.Faster implementation of such proposals will bring benefits to the SMEs and economy at large, faster.
The National Chamber of Commerce is working hand in hand with provincial and District Chambers to address this situation. We conducted the Western Province Entrepreneurship Awards for the second time in 2017, on an invitation by the National Enterprise Development Authority under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. We will pave the way for MSMEs to come to National Level and compete with larger business ventures, through our flagship event of the Chamber - National Business Excellence Awards to conquer the Business world.
It is a known fact that private sector is the growth engine of the development of any economy. It is through Public Private Partnership that we could accomplish far reaching economic goals. In this context we would like to urge the government, international development agencies and private sector to come together.
The Export Development
The Export sector performance is very critical for an economy to progress. Initial steps have been taken by the authorities to prepare the National Export Strategy (NES) for Sri Lanka as a joint effort of public and private sector consultative process under the patronage of Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.
Main theme of the NES is decided as Sri Lanka  An Export Hub driven by Innovation and Investment  with key focus sectors that have been identified as, ICT, wellness and tourism, spice, boat building, Process food & beverages, electronic electrical and machinery. It is of utmost importance that National Export Strategy should be implemented as early as possible. We also feel that it should be revived at regular intervals enabling to bring in timely changes.
Trade support functions were also identified in the said process such as, National Quality Infrastructure, Innovation and R&D, Logistics and Trade Promotion. Potential and mature export products will be benefitted under these trade support functions.
Under the Blue Economy programme of the government, the encouragement extended for deep sea fishing and infrastructure facilities development proposals for Fisheries Sector is also appreciated. Sri Lanka being an island and having one of the biggest sea areas of 517,000 square kilometers, and having fish export ban lifted by EU, we should be able to do much better on fish exports.
Supporting the export industries by way of encouraging investments, offer them attractive terms to acquire latest technology, encourage them to invest in patents and branding in overseas markets, ensuring internationally accepted quality infrastructure and quality certification systems with in the country are vital for the developments of the sector
In an environment that we have regained GSP plus, on behalf of the business community we request authorities, early implementation of National Export Strategy, so the entire economy will be benefitted with a positive impact on employment generation and GDP and narrow the current account deficit.
We have seen the government is getting involved at very high levels on economic diplomacy in sorting out business issues, the recent Tea export ban in Russia can be taken as an example, business community appreciate the same expect continuation of such efforts.
It is vital to keep the cost of production as low as possible so that our products would be competitive in the international market specially competing with Asian countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Myanmar etc. It is a known fact that our utilities such as water electricity are higher in price in the region. India through their Foreign Trade Policy is supporting the export oriented manufacturing and services in an excessive magnitude and Malaysia is also doing the same to boost and encourage exports. We should look at these examples, analyze and should take constructive steps to improve our economy.
Shortages of skilled labour and unemployment
The report on labour demand survey done by Census and Statistics department reveals that 497,000 jobs are available but 380,000 are unemployed. 177,000 employees are needed by service sector, trading sector needs about 110,000, construction sector needs 20,000, for tourism 10,000, and plantation sector needs about 3,000. Shortages of skilled labour continue to be a hindrance across many businesses in manufacturing and services in Sri Lanka. The National Chamber statistics also demonstrate that there is a shortfall in all the industries.
Members at the AGM
In the recent past the government paid considerable attention to the matter and it is essential that Sri Lankan Government continues to focus on policies forming the much required skilled workforce for the industries, therefore it is vital for Sri Lanka to have policies aligned to increase skilled labor availability and to get these skilled labor employed on export related industries is also of paramount importance.
It is significant to understand that there should be a change of attitudes of young community to get in to skilled jobs, social acceptance for these jobs is at a minimum level. The government, private sector and media in this country at large have a great national responsibility to make this transformation happening.
Importance of trade facilitation 
In simple terms, trade facilitation can be recognized as, making it simpler and efficient for traders to move their goods across borders. Doing Business Index of World Bank is also taking Trading Across Borders as a significant evaluation criterion in ranking countries. Under this category, time to export with regard to documentation and border compliance, cost of exports in compliance with documentation and border procedures, importation time and cost related to border procedures and documentation are taken for detailed evaluation. This confirms the importance of cross border trading at every level.
On May 31, 2016 Sri Lankan government ratified the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement where it came to effect in February 2017. In April 2016, Cabinet nod was given to establish the National Trade Facilitation Committee which is chaired by Director General of Sri Lanka Customs and Director General of Department of Commerce as the co-chair, the government sector and the private sector is well represented in this committee ensuring well bonded Public Private Partnership, in achieving the ultimate goal of implementing TFA in Sri Lanka
Additionally, Sri Lankan government requested, the support of World Bank Group for the development and implementation of web based Trade Information Portal, to develop the blueprint of the National Single Window operation. It is with a positive note that we mention the movement has taken every possible step trade facilitating the business community greatly. The National Chamber is working very closely with the Ministry of National Policies and Economic affairs functioning under the Prime Minister, in sorting out business issues faced by the business community, with direction of Paskaralingam, Senior Advisor in the Ministry. It is a very practical way of facilitating trade, hence we would like to encourage such great efforts.
Necessity of having a National Trade Policy for the country 
Since Sri Lanka is negotiating many preferential- free trade agreements at the moment with larger and stronger economies, such as India, China and Singapore, the Cabinet has granted approval to go ahead with the Singapore FTA. The National Chamber is stressing the fact that it is an absolute necessity to have a National Trade Policy for Sri Lanka which will govern and provide directions to any trade agreements to be signed by Sri Lanka with any other country.
It is worth mentioning that India has well defined Foreign Trade Policy which is updated every five years where the current policy statement is applicable to the period of 2015 to 2020. This document provides framework agenda for exports and imports of India for the specified time period, keeping aligned with the vision of Made in India of the Indian government to support both manufacturing and services sectors.
Necessity of having anti-dumping and countervailing measures in Sri Lanka to protect local industries
We have stressed in the recent years, with the background of Sri Lanka entering in to three Free Trade Agreements with very strong economies, in the near future, it is vital to implement  anti-dumping regulations  in Sri Lanka. In other words a common mechanism to protect our domestic industries from unfair trade practices is a absolute necessity. Most of the  emerging economies like India, Brazil and China are already practicing Anti Dumping measures with the view of protecting their local industries. Over the past decade, China and India have rapidly increased their use of anti-dumping laws, the worlds most dominant form of trade protectionism, against their trading partners.
Women & Youth development 
Gender equality and women empowerment plays a key role in the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Positive signs are visible in number of women in decent employment and taking further steps to narrow these gaps are considered vital. Many women continue to work as family workers and informal workers with limited access to social protection mechanisms. We also appreciate the Government initiative of bringing 25% allocation for women participation in local government elections.
The National Chamber of Commerce firmly believes and committed to support women engagement in business and entrepreneurship. In fact the National Chamber had the First woman President of a Chamber in Sri Lanka. Chamber is engaged in supporting women entrepreneurship development at national level as well as provincial and district level. It is our belief that women can seriously contribute to the economic development of this country much more than they contribute at present. We need to see more and more ladies in board rooms in this country contributing to the business development. Youth entrepreneurship & leadership development is also much needed by our country at this juncture, we should train our younger generation to lead the businesses effectively. Creating next level business leaders and allowing them to take practical hands on experience in manufacturing, marketing, sales, financial aspects and entrepreneurship, will ensure the continuation of businesses in the long run.

The Nineteen-Twenties: An Interior
The Caf du Dme de Montparnasse was exactly like that; no American who was trying to be a writer in Paris in the 1920s could fail to recognize the truth of Nathan Aschs picture. Asch himself belonged to a somewhat later group than mine; he was one of the young men, mostly Midwesterners-though he was an exception, having been born in Poland and educated at Syracuse University-who gathered round that remarkable magazine edited by Ford Madox Ford, the Transatlantic Review.
Later he wrote a number of novels, beginning with The Office, that were well received by the critics and had a larger sale in Germany than in the United States; the Germans before Hitler thought that he was a better novelist than his father, Sholem Asch. The Second World War put a temporary stop to his career as a writer. Though overage he enlisted in the Air Force, and though assigned to Public Relations, he flew several combat missions over Germany; he wrote some wonderful letters about his experiences, but didnt publish a word.
That was a grave tactical error. When he got home and started writing again, he found that editors and publishers had forgotten his name, and his postwar work-which includes three novels and many stories-has largely remained in manuscript. Some of this unpublished work is extremely good, though it isnt fashionable.
First rate
This picture of a day at the Dme is a section of a novel, Paris Was Home. Hemingway, who might or might not be recognized as one of the characters in the section, read the novel and had some objections not connected with his own appearance or nonappearance in it. But he also said, when Nathan writes about the Dme at the end and when life was exciting and truly remembered because he was fighting then to be a writer ... it is absolutely first rate. It is. -Malcolm Cowley On the corner made by the boulevards Montparnasse and Raspail and the rue Delambre, across the street from the large and garish Caf de la Rotonde, during those earlier days, was the then smaller place called the Caf du Dme. The Rotonde had new soft benches and polished tables. On the walls it had paintings of nudes, and still-lives of fruit and flowers, and landscapes of Brittany and the south of France.
It had a fancy, spacious washroom with a woman in charge.
The Dme was smokestained and gloomy, and beyond the bar the seating part was circular and on different levels, so that if you were looking for somebody, you went up steps and around, glancing at both sides-in the daytime so little light came through that you almost had to lean over a table, peering, to recognize someone-and then down the steps and you were back at the bar.
The toilet was down a deep stairs, and at the bottom there were two doors. The Mens part was a narrow square where above a hole in the floor stood out two raised foot soles. You carefully stepped on those, twisted around, let your pants down. For toilet paper you used cut-out leaves of the city directory.
The Dme used to open at five-thirty in the morning. The bakery truck came, and a tray of crescent rolls was set on the counter, to surprise one with still-warmth when one took one to dip into the coffee. Outside in the street light stood a row of all night taxis, their meters covered, and inside, the chauffeurs fortified themselves for the ride home.
Early shift
Their voices were night-air-laden, and when an early worker came in to call out in a just-waked-up voice, Good day, they slowly turned their heads and did not answer. Beer pipes were being iced, racks of wine brought up, red wine and white wine and mineral water set for quick use under the counter. Even at this early hour some had a shot of wine mixed with mineral water for their breakfast.
If it was his early shift, Csar came in, in a worn black suit, stiff shirt and stained derby hat, stood at the counter for his coffee like anybody else, lifted the glass with shirking fingers and sipped carefully; then without his hat and jacket, polished bald head reflecting the light, and his stiff shirt but a dickey, went inside to sweep and mop.
A party of all night revelers arrived, filled the Dme with un-morning-like laughter, called for drinks.
When the angry Csar brought them, they did not drink, but their voices becoming languid and forced, ordered breakfast instead, did not eat it, sat in more silence, aware of Csars exasperated banging around them, tired in the midst of the brisk morning. The dawn was greying the street outside, dimming the lights inside.
The taxis had gone. At the counter stood clerks from neighborhood stores, concierges from nearby buildings, railroad men from the Montparnasse station, postmen, housewives, models, hardly dressed, hardly awake.
A meticulously dressed gentleman arrived, sat down with his back toward the window, placed his folded newspaper at the exact center of the table, waited while Csar tied on an apron, put on a very worn black jacket; and a napkin on his arm, shuffled to the counter to push through the crowd, brought the coffee pot and the pitcher of hot milk.

A postscript or prelude
"Below we revisit a review by Virginia Woolf of D. H. Lawrences novel The Lost Girl, published in the TLS of December 2, 1920.
Perhaps the verdicts of critics would read less preposterously and their opinions would carry greater weight if, in the first place, they bound themselves to declare the standard which they had in mind, and, in the second, confessed the course, bound, in the case of a book read for the first time, to be erratic, by which they reached their final decision. Our standard for Mr. Lawrence, then, is a high one.
Taking into account the fact, which is so constantly forgotten, that never in the course of the world will there be a second Meredith or a second Hardy, for the sufficient reason that there have already been a Meredith and a Hardy, why, we sometimes asked, should there not be a D. H. Lawrence By that we meant that we might have to allow him the praise, than which there is none higher, of being himself an original; for such of his work as came our way was disquieting, as the original work of a contemporary writer always is".
High standard
This was the standard which we had in mind when we opened The Lost Girl. We now go on to trace the strayings and stumblings of that mind as it came to the conclusion that The Lost Girl is not an original, or a book which touches the high standard which we have named. Together with our belief in Mr. Lawrences originality went, of course, some sort of forecast as to the direction which that originality was likely to take. We conceived him to be a writer, with an extraordinary sense of the physical world, of the colour and texture and shape of things, for whom the body was alive and the problems of the body insistent and important. It was plain that sex had for him a meaning which it was disquieting to think that we, too, might have to explore.
Sex, indeed, was the first red-herring that crossed our path in the new volume. The story is the story of Alvina Houghton, the daughter of a draper in Woodhouse, a mining town in the Midlands. It is all built up of solid fabric. If you want a truthful description of a drapers shop, evident knowledge of his stock, and a faithful and keen yet not satiric or sentimental description of James Houghton, Mrs. Houghton, Miss Frost, and Miss Pinnegar, here you have it.
Nor does this summary do any kind of justice to the variety of the cast and the number of events in which they play their parts. But, distracted by our preconception of what Mr. Lawrence was to give us, we turned many pages of very able writing in search for something else which must be there. Alvina seemed the most likely instrument to transmit Mr. Lawrences electric shock through the calicos, prints, and miners shirts by which she stood surrounded. We watched for signs of her development nervously, for we always dread originality, yet with the sense that once the shock was received we should rise braced and purified.
External forces
The signs we looked for were not lacking. For example, Married or unmarried, it was the same-the same anguish, realized in all its pain after the age of fifty-the loss in never having been able to relax, to submit. Again, She was returning to Woodhouse virgin as she had left it. In a measure she felt herself beaten. Why Who knows . . . Fate had been too strong for her and her desires. Fate which was not an external association of forces, but which was integral in her own nature.
Such phrases taken in conjunction with the fact that Alvina, having refused her first suitor, wilted and pined, and becoming a midwife mysteriously revived in the atmosphere of the Islington-road, confirmed us in our belief that sex was the magnet to which the myriad of separate details would adhere. We were wrong. Details accumulated; the picture of life in Woodhouse was built up; and sex disappeared. This detail, then this realism, must have another meaning than we had given them. Relieved, yet a trifle disappointed, for we want originality as much as we dread it, we adopted a fresh attitude and read Mr. Lawrence as one reads Mr. Bennett  for the facts, and for the story.
Mr. Lawrence shows indeed something of Mr. Bennetts power of displaying by means of immense industry and great ability a section of the hive beneath glass. Like all the other insects, Alvina runs in and out of other peoples lives, and it is the pattern of the whole that interests us rather than the fate of one of the individuals. And then, as we have long ceased to find in reading Mr. Bennett, suddenly the method seems to justify itself by a single phrase which we may liken to a glow or to a transparency, since to quote one apart from the context would give no idea of our meaning.
In other words, Mr. Lawrence occasionally and momentarily achieves that concentration which Tolstoy preserves sometimes for a chapter or more. And then again the laborious process continues of building up a model of life from saying how dyou do, and cutting the loaf, and knocking the cigarette ash into the ash tray, and standing the yellow bicycle against the wall. Little by little Alvina disappears beneath the heap of facts recorded about her, and the only sense in which we feel her to be lost is that we can no longer believe in her existence.
Momentary phrases
So, though the novel is probably better than any that will appear for the next six months, we are disappointed, and would write Mr. Lawrence off as one of the people who have determined to produce seaworthy books were it not for those momentary phrases and for a strong suspicion that the proper way to look at The Lost Girl is as a stepping stone in a writers progress. It is either a postscript or a prelude.

President reminds people of 'dark era' under MR
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday questioned the nation on whether they wished to go back to the dark era by voting in favour of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Pohottuwa of Prof.G.L. Peiris.
The President made these remarks at a television interview he had with the Sirasa channel yesterday. The President pointed out instances where the media was suppressed, journalists killed, abducted and media institutions set on fire, during the Rajapaksa regime.
Besides, billions of public wealth was looted and state properties sold including the six acre land on which the Army Headquarters was situated and the many acres of Port City project.
The President questioned whether people were ready to go back to the dark era once again by voting for the SLPP.
The President said that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should be strengthened at the forthcoming election so as to ensure a free and just society.
President Sirisena said Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated on three occasions by the people of the country but again he begs votes through the SLPP.
However, he is not a member of the SLPP. He should have a backbone to quit the SLFP, if he really wanted to back up any other political party, he said. The President admitted that there is a delay in taking action against fraud and corruption. But in future he will take measures to get the legal process against these frauds speeded up.
The President added that as an outcome of fruitful steps taken against the monetary misconducts, especially establishing the Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond Issue, unruly persons responsible for mega scale financial irregularities have created a broad alliance to fight corruption in the face of an emerging alliance that seeks to scuttle probes into acts of corruption. However the President stressed that the Government is determined to go ahead with the probes and punish those responsible with immediate effect aiming to establish a healthy and a just society.
The President said that the public are against the arbitrary acts of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
Everyone is duty bound to work for the progress of the country. Not only politicians but also all other persons are responsible to work for the betterment of the country, he noted.

Raising an emotionally healthy child
Continued from last week
Without treatment, many mental disorders can continue into adulthood and lead to problems in all areas of the persons adult life. People with untreated mental disorders are at high risk for many problems, including alcohol or drug abuse, and (depending on the type of disorder) violent or self-destructive behavior, even suicide
Schoolsand teachers have an important role in the recognition of mental health problems and in promoting mental wellbeing for all children
Teachers and Mental Health
Teachers have a lot of responsibilities: helping students progress academically, taking on community leadership roles, and maintaining a safe classroom environment, just to name a few. Yet perhaps nothing is as important in a teachers work as promoting the mental health of students. Students who are mentally healthy are more motivated, self-aware, and able to participate in a classroom community. Moreover, students struggling with mental issues benefit from teachers who are supportive and aware of the issues theyre facing. Lets learn about how you can promote your students mental well-being.
Ten simple strategies to promote positive behavior
1. Verbally acknowledge childrens efforts.
Tell your child/student(s) specifically what he/she did that you are proud of. For example, you can say You were so focused on your math homework tonight! Keep up the good work, That was so nice the way you helped your brother with his maths homework. When children get praised for doing the right thing, they want to do more of it. Virtually all children want to please adults (whether they show it or not) so for most children, praise makes a positive impact. Praise is also an easy way to give your child attention which many children so desperately crave.
2. Use positive body language to show approval for positive behavior.
Positive body language can include a smile, thumbs up, high-five, pat on the back, etc. Keep in mind that some children do not like to be touched and would respond better to something like a thumbs up than a pat on the back. Get to know your child/students to know what they like.
3. Use humor with your child/student(s).
Make jokes, listen to their jokes, smile often, say something silly, sing something you would normally say, or anything else that would make them smile/laugh (make sure it is age appropriate).
4. Show your child/student(s) that you are happy to see them.
Smile at them when they come into the room; for parentsput your arms out for a hug. Ask about their day, weekend, etc. and really listen when they talk.
5. Remind your child/student(s) that they should be proud of themselves
(e.g., You worked so hard on that science project. You should be so proud of yourself!). This helps build internal confidence in them, so they can learn to be proud of themselves for being persistent, working hard, being kind to others, etc. If they feel successful they will be successful.
6 Take an interest in your childs/students interests.
Ask them what they enjoy, get excited about their creations or accomplishments, ask them what they want to learn about, ask them their opinion about things, etc. Teacherstry to incorporate students interests in the classroom. Parentsdo activities with your children (academic or otherwise) that involve something they are interested in, even if it may not be your favorite activity. Let them choose topics of interest for certain activities.
7.Acknowledge your child/student(s) feelings with empathy.
Be understanding when they are nervous because they are trying something for the first time, frustrated because a writing assignment is difficult for them, disappointed because they didnt get invited to a birthday party, or embarrassed because other students laughed at them. Avoid saying things like Stop making a big deal about it, Youll get over it, or Why are you having such a hard time with this; its easy. Instead, make empathetic statements like, I understand that this assignment is frustrating for you or I understand that you are nervous, thats common when trying something new. Also, let them know that you are there to help in any way you can.
8. Be open minded and dont pass judgment on your children/student(s) if their thoughts, values, feelings, or ideas dont match yours.
Of course it is okay to share your opinion (and unsafe or hurtful behavior is unacceptable), but in general, dont make them wrong for their opinion. They need to feel like they can be open and be themselves around the adults in their lives. When children feel like they wont be judged or made wrong, they are more likely to talk to us when there is a real problem.
9. Be a role model for good behavior.
If you want your child to treat others with respect, you do the same. If you want your child to be an honest person, set an example of honesty for them.
10. Follow through on your promises and rules (barring unforeseen consequences) and stay away from empty threats.
If you tell your child/student(s) that they can pick a favorite book to read after they finish their math assignment, make sure you stick to your end of the bargain. If you tell your child that he can go on the computer after his sister has a turn, make sure he gets a chance to do that.
Have consistent rules that teach your children that they need to stick to their end of the bargain as well. For example, if you have a rule such as Homework first, then TV. stick to that rule by making sure your child completes homework before watching TV.
Definition
According to ayurvedic texts, a person is said to have good health or swasthya (in Sanskrit) when they enjoy a balance of physical and psychological elements (samadosha), of energies produced in the body (samagnischa), and of tissues in the organs (samadhatu) combined with proper elimination of wastes (malakriya), a happy soul (prasannatma), a happy, functioning mind (prasanna-manaha) and proper functioning of the five senses (sama-indriya).
To put it simply, allopathy treats specific symptoms with quick results, while ayurveda works on the premise that all disorders (whether physical or mental) result from an imbalance of one of more of the factors mentioned above. Effective treatment, practitioners believe, lies only in the holistic approach. It is this approach that leads psychiatrists to believe that ayurveda may hold the possibilities of a complementary, if not alternative treatment, for mental health issues.
Ayurveda, ayu (age) + veda (science) is the science of life. A science that encompasses the mind, body and soul with health. This ancient medicine has become the go-to treatment in several parts of Asian countries, because the absence of side effects. But while it is common knowledge that ayurveda is used to treat physical ailments, it is also being used as an alternative and complementary therapy in the treatment of mental health issues.
Ayurveda and mental health
Ayurveda produces significant results as a complementary treatment method to allopathy in disorders such as depression, anxiety and OCD. There have been studies conducted where the dependency on allopathic medicine was reduced with a simultaneous increase in the ayurvedic dosage, said Dr.LeenaIlleperuma MD (Ay), a consultant ayurvedic physician. She adds that there have also been cases where dependency on allopathic medication has been completely eliminated.
Ayurvedic drugs provide for a holistic change in the patient while allopathy deals with specific symptoms of the disorder. Ayurveda recommends traditional dietary and lifestyle habits along with yogic exercises and herbal treatment. It has proved to be an alternative form of treatment, which not only includes treating the disorder  physical and psychological  but also bringing in a change in the lifestyle of the person to prevent future illnesses.
Ayurveda stands by its definition of health, in which a healthy mind plays an important role. Being a holistic science, ayurveda explores the symbiotic relationship among the mind, body, soul, the senses and their workings. It approaches mental health in the following way:
 The human being is a constitution of the mind, body, soul and senses, also called Manas, Sarira, Atma and Indriya respectively. This includes psychological senses (Gyanendriya) and physical organs (Karmendriya). The dynamics of these primary constituents govern the health of a person.
 Manas is a constitution of three operational qualities: Satva, Rajas and Tamas. Also called gunas, these define the character or tatva of a person. Satvaguna is an amalgamation of all things good  self-control, knowledge, power to determine right and wrong in life. The qualities of Rajas guna are to be in motion, violent, envious, authoritative, desirous and confused. The characteristics of Tamas are being dull, inactive, lazy, sleepy or drowsy. Of these gunas, Rajasand Tamas are referred as Manodoshas. The imbalance of Satva, Rajas and Tamas are responsible for mental illness, known as Manovikara.
On the other hand, the body, which is believed to be formed from nature is comprised of three psycho-biological elements: Vata (air element), Pitta (fire element) and Kapha (earth element). These elements are also known as the tridoshas.
Dr.LeenaIlleperumawho has been practicing ayurvedic medicine for more than a decade, states that the tridoshas are essentially negative in nature, (in Sanskrit, dosha means fault) but they are actually protecting the body. She adds that when the three doshas go awry, they attack the body and cause illness to either one part in the body or the whole. This also affects the mind, causing mental disturbances and even illness. Therefore, the treatment in ayurveda focuses on treating both the mental illness and physical because they are inter-related.
Studies being conducted by ayurvedic practitioners on the effects of the treatment or specific medicine on disorders such as depression, anxiety have shown visible results
Ayurveda management
Ayurveda recommends three types of chikitsa viz., daivavyapasrayachikitsa (divine or spiritiual/therapy), yuktivyapasrayachikitsa (logical therapy), and satwavajayachikitsa (psycho therapy), for treating mental illnesses as well. Let us examine them in brief.
1. Daivavyapasrayachikitsa:
This refers to measure like mantra, (incantation), Ausadhi (wearing scared herbs), mani (wearing precious gems), mangala (propitiatory rites), bali (oblations), homa(sacrifice), upahara (offerings), niyama (vows), prauascitta (ceremonial penitence), upavasa (fasts), swastyayana (prostrations), pranipata (surrender), gamana (pilgrimage), etc,. These measures are recommended in mental disorders caused by agantu(extraneous) factors and administered judiciously after considering the nature, faith, religiosity, culture and educational level, of the patient. (Ch. Shi. 9/93-4). These may be useful in all types of manasavikara, i.e. both psychosis and neurosis.
2. Yuktivyapasrayachikitsa:
This refers to the use of ahara (diet) and oushadha (drugs). Under ahara, it is interesting to note that different food articles like ksira (milk), ghrita (ghee), draksa (grapes), panasa (jack fruit), Brahmi (Centellaasiatica- plant), mahishamamsa (buffalo meat), kurmamamsa (tortoise meat), vastuka (goose foot), kakamaci (solanumnigirum), mahakusmanda( ash gourd) kapittha (wood apple) matulunga * and others are recommended as benificial in various mental disorders(38). *(Citrus medica)
Under drug therapy, it is said that, in all types of mental diseases where vata, pitta and kapha are deranged, doshashodhana or srotasuddhi (elimination of dosha or shodhana or srotasuddhi (elimination of dosha or cleansing, the cells) has to be done by adopting various sodhana (purificatory measures). When the cleaning is properly done, samanausadha (palliatives) and rasayana (tonics) are given in order to bring back the deranged manas to normalcy.
3. Satvavajayachikitsa:
The aim of this therapy is to restrain mind from desire for unwholesome objects. This permits considering, occupational, behavioral and like therapies as well, since the ultimate aim of them also would be to restrain mind from unwholesome objects.

Refrain from strikes upto February 15 - Deshapriya
The Election Commission yesterday requested all trade unions not to conduct strikes and other activities disturbing the election process until February 15.
A letter of request will be sent to all Trade Unions by the Election Commission asking for their cooperation to hold the election process without any hindrances, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
Deshapriya made these observations at a press brief held at the Election Commission premises yesterday evening. He observed that a large number of Trade Unions are using the coming election to win their demands unlike ever before. Deshapriya also said the Election Commission has requested political parties to interfere in the matter as well.
Deshapriya pointed out that the Commission respects the TUs right to bargain with their administration at an election to win their demands. However, they should not obstruct peoples right to vote, Deshapriya said. So I would like to request all trade unions and political parties involved in this, to refrain from using the election to realise their demands. These trade union actions are a great hindrance to the election process.As you all may know, most of the government workers are a part of the election process.The TUs should realise that if they are to fight with the administration for their rights, first they should establish a democratically elected government. If we keep postponing elections, it will lead to dictatorship.TUs have no power under a dictatorship. he said.

Sri Lanka  Singapore FTA: A New Dawn
The Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement signals a move towards a deepening economic relationship with Singapore. The critical policy question for Sri Lanka is how to fully benefit from such an agreement.
The two small island countries have enjoyed warm diplomatic ties for several decades. Singapores founding father, Lee Kuan Yew once noted, Ceylon was Britains model Commonwealth country. However, Sri Lanka is yet to fully realise the economic benefits of long-standing diplomatic ties with Singapore, in terms of export earnings or foreign investment flows. In terms of export values, Singapore was only Sri Lankas 20th largest trading partner in 2016.
Significance of the new agreement 
The signing of the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement is pivotal for several reasons. The first of these is that the agreement indicates that Singapore recognises Sri Lankas potential as a trading hub in the Indian Ocean and as an entry point to fast-growing South Asia. It also underlines Singapores search for new trade and investment partners amidst a sharp slowdown in economic growth and rising wages. In addition, the agreement is a landmark in Sri Lankas trade policy, as it seeks to improve the countrys trade openness and boost growth. It is also Sri Lankas most comprehensive trade agreement with any country and the first bilateral FTA since 2005. Finally, it signals Sri Lankas serious intent to engage in FTA-led regionalism with East Asia.
Content of the FTA 
The comprehensive FTA covers goods, services, investments, trade facilitation, intellectual property rights and government procurement, among others. The SLSFTA also has specific policies to simplify customs procedures and provisions to target the financial services, telecommunications, and e-commerce sectors.
Singapore is one of the worlds most open and market-oriented economies, with 99% of all goods imports entering duty-free and few banned imports. Hence, market access to Singapore has not been a barrier for Sri Lankan exporters, even before the signing of the FTA. Meanwhile, the new agreement provides Sri Lankan firms with a relatively long adjustment period. It ensures that Sri Lanka will open 80% of its market in the next 12 years to Singaporean exporters.
The SLSFTA offers several potential economic gains for Sri Lanka. Among others, it will increase competition from imports which spurs industrial restructuring, it can bring increased FDI flows into services and high-end manufacturing, and it can stimulate enhanced technology and skill transfer. Sri Lankas SMEs can gain from subcontracting opportunities and selling services to larger firms. For Singapore, Sri Lanka represents an untapped potential market as they explore new opportunities for investment in financial services, insurance, and infrastructure development.
How can Sri Lanka fully benefit 
To take proper advantage of the agreement, Sri Lanka must position itself strategically in four crucial areas.
(i) Address the bilateral trade deficit which sits to Singapores advantage
Sri Lankan exports to Singapore in 2016 were only USD 115 million2 but imports from Singapore are over USD 1 billion and accounts for 5 per cent3 of Sri Lankan imports overall. Furthermore, Sri Lankas main exports to Singapore are textiles, precious and semi-precious stones, refined petroleum, ships and boats and electronic inputs. But areas such as agriculture, fisheries, and trade in services are lagging. Sri Lankan firms must improve their price, quality, and delivery capability to export to Singapores highly competitive and high-income market. Effective trade remedies such as temporary safeguards and anti-dumping policies should be enacted promptly in Sri Lanka to prevent round-tripping of state-subsidised cheap imports from China and ASEAN countries via Singapore. It is hoped that the rules of origin in the SLSFTA will be sufficient.
(ii) Increase inward investment from Singapore
A handful of impressive Singaporean businesses exist in Sri Lanka. Overseas Realty PLC, a publicly listed property developer worth LKR 20 billion5 has operated in Sri Lanka since 1980. Over 90 per cent of Overseas Realty, the developer of Colombos landmark World Trade Centre, is owned by the Singaporean Shing Kwan Group, which specialises in real estate investment, development and management. Although this investment is likely to increase following the FTA, Singapore only accounted for about 5.3% of total FDI inflows into Sri Lanka during 2014-2017.
Increasing FDI from Singapore is therefore, another key priority for Sri Lanka in implementing the FTA. The agreement rightly includes legal protections and other measures to incentivise Singaporean companies to invest. The Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) has also identified key sectors to target FDI inflows including infrastructure, BPO/IT services, tourism, and education.7 But Sri Lankas domestic investment climate remains a major stumbling block.
Sri Lanka ranks 111 on the 2018 World Bank Ease of Doing Business Index, compared to Singapores top rating of number two which is second only to New Zealand. It takes as much as 7-9 days to open a business in Sri Lanka but only 2.5 days in Singapore.Cutting down on red tape, streamlining redundant colonial era business regulations, and demonstrating policy consistency would help gain the trust of Singaporeans to invest in Sri Lanka.
(iii) Get Singaporean expertise for sustainable development
Sri Lanka must leverage the capabilities of world class Singaporean companies like CPG Consultants and the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore, in areas of their economic specialisation  urban planning and design, operating industrial and tourism development zones, port-related development and logistics services. Partnerships and joint ventures between Sri Lankan and Singaporean companies to gain successful market entry are critical for inclusive development.
Sri Lankas BOI should also look to Singapores Economic Development Board (EDB) as a model of attracting inward investment.
The Singapore EDB has a network of overseas offices staffed by highly qualified people with the sole purpose of marketing Singapore as an investment destination.9 Such a model of innovative programmes and expertise could be replicated in Sri Lanka to target flagship investors headquartered in Singapore as a means to increase inward investment. Sri Lanka should seek technical assistance from Singapore to restructure the BOI to better promote inward FDI.
(iv) Use Singapore as a gateway to East Asia
Above all else, Sri Lanka must leverage its upgraded relationship with Singapore for entry into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
The RCEP includes China, India and ASEAN economies. For Sri Lanka, joining RCEP would provide access to ASEANs dynamic marketplace and FDI.
The RCEP bloc represents 31% of global GDP, accounts for 27% of global trade,11 and 19% of global FDI flows.12 Sri Lanka is already a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum but is only involved in informal discussions on security issues, not on economic ones. Observer status of ASEAN would be an imperative first step for Sri Lankas journey to join RCEP, and enhance diplomatic and economic ties with ASEAN.
The Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA is undoubtedly good, in economic terms, for Singapore. It can also be good for Sri Lanka and is therefore, a welcome step in improving outward-orientation and ties with East Asia. However, the benefits will not automatically flow to Sri Lanka.
The countrys investment climate needs significant improvement and firms should address their gaps in export competitiveness.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka should attempt to reap Singaporean expertise for sustainable development and investment promotion. Finally, utilising Singapores influence, Sri Lankas trade diplomatic efforts should be stepped up to gain observer status of ASEAN as a pathway to eventual RCEP membership.

Sri Lanka achieves highest ever FDI in 2017
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Sri Lanka grew over US$1.63bn in 2017, doubling from the US$802m achieved the previous year.
The Board of Investment (BOI), the agency tasked with promoting and facilitating FDI, reported that US$1.63bn has been achieved in 2017, which is the highest ever surpassing the US$ 1.61 in 2014, with solid growth across key sectors.
The strong growth is a direct consequence of the Governments reorientation of economic policy towards investment and export driven growth, rather than debt-funded public infrastructure spending.
Among the highest growth sectors were export-oriented Manufacturing (+27 percent) and Services which includes Tourism and IT (+50 percent) and Infrastructure (+190 percent). The highest FDI came from China, followed by Hong Kong, India and Singapore.
The BOI, under the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, is the first point of contact for foreign investors into the country.
The outstanding FDI results have been achieved due to the hard work, talent and dedication of our investment promotion and facilitation teams as well as the pro-investor policy framework of the government to support both local and foreign investors, BOI Director General Duminda Ariyasinghe said. Over the past 2 years, the BOI has targeted both new investors, leveraging the countrys strengths and advantages, as well using existing investors to increase reinvestments and to use their external networks to bring in new investors in sectors such as export-oriented manufacturing. The agency has focused on fast and transparent decision-making utilising two high level committees appointed by the Prime Minister that provides approvals as well as accelerated operational clearances.
Ariyasinghe said BOI has embarked on several new initiatives including a virtual One Stop Shop for investment facilitation with 24 government agencies which will come into operation in 2018 to strengthen the approval and executional mechanisms. The support and guidance from our Chairman and the Board of Directors has been a strength to us in achieving these strong results,he said.
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama said that while Sri Lanka has achieved strong FDI results in 2017, the country has only scratched the surface of its full potential.
This is not a time for complacency but renewed focus to use the momentum to strengthen reforms to improve our Ease of Doing Business ranking, and efforts to attract high-quality investors from countries we have renewed bilateral relationships with.
The Minister said the countrys target was to achieve US$5b in FDI by 2020. Samarawickrama said he was confident of achieving US$2.5bn of FDI in 2018. In order to facilitate FDI, the new Inland Revenue Act provides accelerated investment allowances over and above normal depreciation until companies recover their total fixed investment.
The foreign exchange regime too has been liberalsed to improve the investment climate via the new Foreign Exchange Act.The BOI has initiated work on developing several new export promotion zones including Milleniya, Bingiriya, Weligama and Mawathagama. These will be the first comprehensive BOI zones to be developed since 2000.
