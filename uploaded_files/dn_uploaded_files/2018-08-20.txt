Mitchell Johnson retires from all forms of cricket
SYDNEY Sunday: Australian fast bowler Mitchell Johnson said Sunday he was retiring from all forms of cricket as his body was starting to shut down, almost three years after he stepped down from the international game.
The 36-year-old quit Twenty20 Big Bash League (BBL) team the Perth Scorchers last month, but had not ruled out playing in the Indian Premier League or other domestic T20 competitions.
It's over. I've bowled my final ball. Taken my final wicket. Today I announce my retirement from all forms of cricket, Johnson wrote for the Perth Now news website on Sunday. I had hoped to continue playing in various Twenty20 competitions around the world until perhaps the middle of next year.
But the fact is my body is starting to shut down. Johnson said he experienced back problems during this year's IPL and that was probably a sign that it was time to move on. I'm ready to break clear of playing cricket and move on to the next period of my life, he added.
If I can't play at 100 percent then I can't give my best to the team. And for me it's always been about the team. Johnson said he would consider channelling his competitive edge into a coaching or mentoring role in the future.
Renowned for his ferocious pace, Johnson announced his retirement from international cricket during the Test series against New Zealand in Perth in November 2015, saying he had lost the hunger to play the long form of the game. From the coastal Queensland city of Townsville, Johnson made his first class debut with the state in 2001 before getting his start in the Test team in 2007.
His best haul was 8-61 against South Africa, at the WACA in 2008. Described by long-time mentor Dennis Lillee as a once in a generation bowler, the former ICC Cricketer of the Year played 73 Tests for Australia, claiming 313 wickets.
He also claimed 239 wickets in 153 one-day internationals, and 38 wickets in 30 T20 internationals for Australia.
Johnson joined the Scorchers following his retirement from international cricket. In the IPL, he had stints with the Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Kings XI Punjab. - AFP

## Title: Moderate amount of carbohydrates best for healthy lifespan

Moderate amount of carbohydrates best for healthy lifespan
Eating either a low-carb diet or a high-carb diet raises the risk of an early death, according to a major new study which will dismay the many people who have ditched the likes of bread, rice and potatoes for weight loss or health reasons.
Researchers who pooled the results of eight large studies have found that eating a moderate amount of carbohydrates is best for a healthy lifespan. Less than 40 per cent or more than 70 per cent of calories from carbohydrates carried a higher risk of mortality.
Not all low-carb diets are equal, however. People who ate a lot of meat and fats instead of carbohydrates, such as lamb, chicken, steak, butter and cheese, had a higher mortality risk than those who got their protein and fats from plant-based foods such as avocados, legumes and nuts. Popular weight loss diets such as Atkins and Dukan include a substantial amount of meat-based foods.
Low-carb diets that replace carbohydrates with protein or fat are gaining widespread popularity as a health and weight loss strategy, said Dr Sara Seidelmann, a clinical and research fellow in cardiovascular medicine from Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston, who led the research published in the Lancet public health journal.
However, our data suggests that animal-based low-carbohydrate diets, which are prevalent in North America and Europe, might be associated with shorter overall life span and should be discouraged. Instead, if one chooses to follow a low-carbohydrate diet, then exchanging carbohydrates for more plant-based fats and proteins might actually promote healthy ageing in the long term.
Seidelmann, who is both a cardiologist and a nutritionist, told the Guardian the team had published a substantial body of work to thoroughly answer a question and not simply provide just one piece of the picture.
Nutrition is high up on everybodys mind but there is such confusion about what we should eat. One day, a study is coming out telling us high carb is better, another day a study is telling us low carb is better.
Trials to compare low-carb and high-carb diets directly are not possible, because they have to be carried out over many years and people find it hard to stick to a diet over any length of time. Instead, her team carried out observational research with more than 15,400 people, aged 45 to 64, from diverse socio-economic backgrounds from four US communities who were enrolled in the atherosclerosis risk in communities study. Those people filled out questionnaires on their eating patterns on two occasions, six years apart. Their health was followed up for 25 years, allowing for factors that might alter the results, such as smoking, income and diabetes. These results were pooled with seven other observational studies carried out across the world, involving a total of more than 430,000 people.
They found that 50-year-olds eating a moderate carb diet, with half their energy coming from carbohydrates, had a further life expectancy of 33 years, which was four years longer than those on low-carb diets and one year longer than those who ate a high-carb diet.
The authors said they could not prove cause and effect, because of the nature of the studies. However, they said people who embraced western-type diets that heavily restricted carbohydrates often ate fewer vegetables, fruit, and grains and more animal proteins and fats. Some of those animal products have been implicated in stimulating inflammatory pathways, biological ageing and oxidative stress, and could be a contributing factor to the increased risk of mortality.
High-carb diets are common in Asian and poorer nations, they said, where people eat a lot of refined carbohydrates such as white rice. Those also contribute to a chronically high glycaemic load and worse metabolic outcomes. theguardian

MoU signed to expand document attestation
A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the Foreign Ministry and Home Affairs Ministry on August 16 to expand the document attestation services provided through the Electronic Document Attestation System (e-DAS) of the Foreign Affairs Ministry to Divisional Secretariats.
Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam and Home Affairs Ministry Secretary S.T. Kodikara signed the MoU in the presence of Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena during the Government Agents Conference held at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA) recently. The MoU will enable expanding the Electronic Document Attestation System initially to 19 Divisional Secretariats in the Galle District. The facility will be extended to 332 Divisional Secretariats island-wide thereafter.
Connecting the Divisional Secretariats island-wide to the Electronic Document Attestation System will allow the public to have their required documentation processed at the nearest Divisional Secretariat without visiting the Consular Affairs Division in Colombo. People in the Northern Province who visit the Regional Consular Office in Jaffna for the purpose can have document attestation through their nearest Divisional Secretariats. The Canadian Government has donated equipment worth Rs. 6.8 million through the International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the pilot project. Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena thanked the Canadian Government for the donation of equipment and requested all Government Agents to support to implement the Electronic Document Attestation System at the Divisional Secretariats in all districts. Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said the functioning of the Electronic Document Attestation System at the Divisional Secretariat level would effectively serve the migrant workers who annually remit foreign exchange here.

Tribute
The Naipaul nitty-gritty
The world is what it is
VS Naipaul, exquisite craftsman of the English language, magnificent story teller, and master of the unsparing nonfiction narrative passed away on August 11.
Grandson of an indentured Indian labourer shipped willy-nilly to the Caribbean to work the newly established sugar farms, the Naipaul journey is an amazing modern era story of colonialism, migration, displacement and finally, of freedom.
From Trinidad the talented young Naipaul won a scholarship to Oxford to study English literature. Difficult times followed in the austere post World War (II) England, while the budding author struggled to find his feet. Then, came the compelling novels; the Mystic Masseur, A House for Mr. Biswas, Miguel Street, Mimic Men, A Bend in the River, the Enigma of Arrival; literary masterpieces, announcing the advent of an extraordinary talent, compared by critics with the greats like Conrad, Dickens and Tolstoy.
It is however in his riveting non-fiction, travel writing to put in limply; a searing juggernaut into post-colonial societies and the souls of men inhabiting them that Naipaul stands on Olympian heights.
Few extracts
To attempt to review Naipauls wide ranging coverage of a large swath of humanity in one short tribute is daunting. However, we can offer a few extracts from some of his writings, hoping the reader is inspired to explore further.
Naipauls first visit to India as a young man of twenty nine (in the early 1960s ) brought forth An Area of Darkness , the first of his monumental trilogy of the homecoming of the Indian immigrant.
The youthful tourist brings with him on the ship a few bottles of whisky, which, true to form, are seized by the Bombay Customs. It is a mindless act of bureaucracy; the traveller may reclaim them later.
Naipaul describes his torment at the hands of the Licence Raj thus.
To be in Bombay was to be exhausted. The moist heat sapped energy and will, and some days passed before I decided to recover my bottles.
One step a day: this was my rule. And it was not until the following afternoon that I took a taxi back to the docks. The customs officer in white and the degraded man in blue (menial worker) were surprised to see me.
Did you leave something behind here
I left two bottles of liquor.
You didnt. We seized two bottles from you. They were sealed in your presence.
That is what I meant. Ive come to get them back.
But we dont keep seized liquor here. Everything we seize and seal is sent off at once to the New Customs Office.
My taxi was searched on the way out.
The New Customs Office was a large, two storied PWD building, governmentally gloomy, and it was as thronged as a court-house.
Upstairs I stood in a slow queue, at the end of which I discovered only an accountant.
You dont want me. You want that officer in the white pants, over there. He is a nice fellow.
I went to him.
You have your liquor permit
I showed him the stamped and signed foolscap sheaf.
You have your transport permit
It was the first time I had heard of this permit. I was exhausted, sweating and when I opened my mouth to speak I found I was on the verge of tears.
I thrust all the papers I had at him: my liquor permit, my customs receipt, my passport, my receipt for wharfage charges, and my tourist introduction card.
What is a transport permit Why didnt they give it to me I am going to write to the papers about this.
I wish you would said the customs officer I keep telling them that they must tell the people about this transport permit. Not only for you. We had an American here yesterday who said he was going to break the bottle as soon as he got it.
Naipaul visited India again in the early 1970s, during the turmoil of the emergency rule of Mrs. Indira Gandhi. In 1977 came India-A Wounded Civilization.
The princes of India-their number and variety reflecting to a large extent the chaos that had come to the country with the break-up of the Mughal Empire, losing real power in the British time. Through generations of idle servitude they had grown to specialize only in style, a bogus, extinguishable glamour.
The power of this prince had continued; he had become an energetic entrepreneur. But in his own eyes, and in the eyes of those who served him, he remained a prince.
What keeps a country together Love, love and affection. That is our Indian wayYou can feed my dog. But he wont obey you. Hell obey me. Where is the economics in that Thats love and affection.For twenty eight years until 1947, I ruled this State. Power of life and death
In 1971, after she split the Congress, Mrs. Gandhi called a midterm election. I followed this election in one constituency, Ajmer, in the semi-desert state of Rajasthan. The candidate standing against Mrs. Gandhi was a blind old Congressman who had taken part in the independence struggle and had gone to jail. He was a little vain of having gone to jail, and spoke as though the young people coming up who hadnt gone to jail (and couldnt have, because the British had gone away twenty five years ago) couldnt be said to have a record of service.
I asked him one day, as we were racing across the desert in his campaign jeep, what it was about Gandhi that he particularly admired. He said without hesitation that he admired Gandhi for going to Buckingham Palace in 1931 in a dhoti; that act put the picture of poor India before the world. As though the world didnt know
No other country was more fitted to welcome a conqueror; no other conqueror was more welcome than the British Naipaul wrote. While dominating India they expressed their contempt for it, and projected England; and Indians were forced into a nationalism which in the beginning was like a mimicry of the British.
Then to Africa I travel to discover other states of mind wrote Naipaul. He went to Congo, the former Belgian colony, renamed Zaire. In A New King for the Congo Naipaul writes:
The man who made himself the King of this land used to be called Joseph Mobutu. His father was a cook. But Joseph educated himself and at sometime was a journalist. In 1960 when the country became independent Mobutu was thirty, a sergeant in the local Force Publique, which became the Congolese army. In 1965, as General Mobutu, he seized power. He abandoned the name Joseph and is now known as Mobutu Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga.
It is said that the last five words of his name are a reference to sexual virility which an African chief must possess: he is the cock that leaves no hen alone. But the words may only be symbolic. Because as chief, Mobutu is married to his people.
He is citizen, chief, king, revolutionary, an African freedom fighter supported by spirits of the ancestors.
Muhammad Ali fought George Foreman in Kinshasa last November. Ali won: but the victor, in Zaire, was Mobutu. A big hoarding outside the stadium says A fight between two blacks, in a black nation, organised by blacks and seen by the whole world is a victory for Mobutism.
He is the man, young but palpitating with wisdom and dynamism, who during the dark days of secessions and rebellions thought through to the heart of the problem- from a University of Zaire publication.
The fantasy ended in the 1990s amid tribal and secessionists warring and Mobutu fled the country to Morocco. Today, nearly half the population of the Republic of Congo (renamed again, after Mobutu fled), are below the poverty line. The GDP per capita of Congo is approximately US $1500.
Later, Naipaul turned his eyes to the lands of faith; Iran, Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, touring the non-Arab Muslim countries extensively. These journeys produced two trailblazing volumes, Among the Believers and Beyond Belief.
Nobel Prize in Literature
He wrote of Pakistan It had a simple, terrible flaw. Even with the frightful communal flight, a great number of Muslims remained in India making it the worlds second largest Muslim country and they included the most experienced politically. Without them, the State languished or rather only the armed forces flourished, becoming masters, a country within a country.
The State withered. But faith didnt. Failure only led back to the faith. If the State failed it was not because the dream was flawed or the faith flawed; it could only be because men had failed the faith. A purer and purer faith began to be called for.
More than half a Century of independence, most of the former colonies are deep in the mire of tyranny, corruption and overall dereliction. Inadequate men, with a small clique of collaborators, most times family members, rule by bribery, secret police and violence. Periodically, hopes are raised by various devises; new governments, new constitutions, fancy trade agreements, mega projects announced with much fanfare, only to be disappointed by inevitable failure, expectations turning into hopeless cynicism.
Naipauls magisterial, frighteningly acute expositions of the former colonies, their people and palpable failings are not without detractors. Caribbean born poet and writer Derek Walcott, winner of the 1992 Nobel Prize in literature called him VS Nightfall in a poem, arguing that Naipaul was scarred by his revulsion towards Negroes and that his self-disfiguring sneer is praised for its probity. Nevertheless, Walcott was pleased when Naipaul was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature (in 2001), It will mean something for the region.
VS Naipauls younger brother Shiva Naipaul, who followed his famous brother to Oxford several years later to study literature, wrote The longer I live the more convinced I become that one of the greatest honours we can confer on other people is to see them as they are, to recognize not only that they exist, but that they exist in specific ways and have specific realities.
Perhaps this is the main lesson in Naipaul. People are different, they exist in different realities.
To view the foibles and the fault lines of a reality of recurring failure through rose coloured glasses, indulge in sentimentality or delight in wishful thinking is not for him. He took the world for what it is.
Not so long ago Naipaul savaged Tony Blair calling him a Pirate, heading a socialist revolution, destroying the idea of civilization in this country and creating a plebeian culture.
Writer and conservative politician David Pryce-Jones describes Naipaul thus (Naipaul is truly a Nobel man in a free state).
Victimhood might have been his central theme, granted his background. Not at all, that same determination to be a writer also liberated him from self-pity. Each one of us, his books declare, can choose to be a free individual. It is a matter of will and choice, and above all intellect. Critics have sometimes argued that people-in the Third World especially, are trapped in their culture and history, without possibility of choice, and can only be free if others make them so. To them, VS Naipauls vision that they have to take responsibility for themselves can seem like some sort of First World privilege, and a conservative philosophy at that.

Namibia qualify for 2019 World Cup
WINDHOEK, Namibia, Saturday: Namibia booked their place at the World Cup for the sixth successive time on Saturday with a 53-28 victory over Kenya.
Namibia will play in Pool B at the 2019 World Cup in Japan alongside defending champions New Zealand, South Africa and Italy as well as the winners of the repechage event.
That final qualifying round will feature Kenya, Germany, Canada and Hong Kong and will be played in Marseille in November.
The winners will take the final spot for the Japan showpiece.
Namibia went onto the offensive from the start on Saturday, forcing the visitors to concede an early penalty try.
But Kenya fought their way back when Sevens star Willy Ambaka, who scored two tries on his Test debut against Tunisia, touched down at the corner and Darwin Mukidza converted to give the visitors a 7-3 lead.
Full-back Chrysander Botha and Louis Van der Westhuizen then scored back-to-back tries to put Namibia in the driving seat.
Van der Westhuizen turned over the ball for his second try when he combined well with Jan-Pieter Van Lill at the start of the second half for a 29-7 lead.
Ambaka would score his second try of the match but it was a little too late for Kenya, as Namibia increased their tally when Max Katjijeko scored the fifth try.
Despite two late tries by replacements Malcolm Onsando and scrum half Mohammed Omolo, Namibia extended their domination over the East Africans when Botha and Cliven Loubser completed the scoring for the winners. - AFP

No radioactive waste will enter Sri Lanka through the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka asserted.
The minister made this comment in reply to the concerns raised by some critiques that certain provisions of the FTA with Singapore would enable the dumping of radioactive waste in Sri Lanka.
The minister, speaking to the media after an event in Kandy, insisted those were false alarms meant to mislead the people.
The Atomic Energy Authority was under my purview for about 10 years. We have fixed a special appliance at the port to detect any type of radiation in any item coming into the country. We received it from the US Nuclear Technological Institute. The AEA is equipped with advanced technology to carry out any sort of radiation test within the country. Therefore, the people need not panic over these fear mongering false statements, he said.

Orthodox heresy
Kamel Daoud first came to attention in 2015 with the publication of his novel Meursault, contre-enqute (translated into English as The Meursault Investigation). The critic Adam Shatz described it as a postcolonial sequel to Albert Camuss Ltranger. Camuss novel of 1942 is set in the French Algerian town of Oran and tells the story of an out-of-place anti-hero called Meursault who buries his mother without shedding a tear, makes love to a woman mechanically, and one day kills an Arab on a beach, an act that he later blames on sunstroke.
He is condemned to death by guillotine, a fate he reacts to with indifference. From Camuss perspective, it is a tale of alienation and the absurd. But it is also a novel that says something about the unequal colonial relationship: Arabs, in the novel, are mute and nameless. They are part of the decor of French Algeria, and occasionally threatening. In The Meursault Investigation, the Arabs brother reclaims his voice, and talks back.
Wittily irreverent
The novel placed Daoud in the pantheon of francophone novelists. It also ensured that the columns that he had been writing for the daily Quotidien dOran would now also appear in Le Monde, La Repubblica and the New York Times. Mes Indpendances is a collection of these columns written between 2010 and 2016 (an American edition, Chroniques, translated by Elisabeth Zerofsky and published by Other Press, is appearing in October). Incisive, occasionally witty and always irreverent, Daouds pen spares no one, not the Algerian state, or its aged leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika, or the Islamists that were co-opted by the state after the civil war of the 1990s, or Arab nationalism, or far-right populism in Europe. Daouds courage in confronting the Algerian state is particularly commendable. Run by ageing army generals, it is shrouded in secrecy and protected by legions of informants and a brutal police force; its only real source of legitimacy is a war of independence that came to an end more than half a century ago.
One striking aspect of these columns is Daouds criticism of the linguistic Arabization of Algeria, which an elite in thrall to the ideology of Arab nationalism imposed on society after independence. He calls this process the other colonial project in Algeria. Many Algerian intellectuals agree with him that Algeria is at best an imperfect Arab nation. The elites should have made the spoken tongue, Algerian Arabic, the national language. Anyone who is aware of the linguistic contradictions of the country, torn between French, standard Arabic and Algerian Arabic, would sympathize. However dim Daouds view of the Algerian state and of Arab dictators, he reserves his greatest ire for fundamentalism, this disease of Islam. He knows the fundamentalists well for having been one in his youth (Daoud is forty-eight). He considers the Salafi televangelists  or talk show sheikhs as he calls them  to be the cause of most of the ills of not only Algeria, but the Arab and Islamic world more broadly. In December 2014, one of those televangelists, Abdelfatah Hamadache used Facebook to call for Daouds prosecution and execution. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in prison. Beyond Salafism, Daouds target is the matrix of the fundamentalist problem: the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. For him, ISIS was spawned by the invasion of Iraq on the one hand, and, on the other, by Saudi Arabia, with its ideological industry and fatwa valley.
Humanitarian grounds
Daoud declines to show solidarity with the Palestinians in the name of religious or ethnic kinship; he would rather do so on humanitarian grounds. He prefers to blame the Palestinian problem on what he sees as the failures of the Arab world and the ravages of fundamentalism. He wishes his fellow Algerians would move on from the habit of blaming their predicament on colonialism, and instead take responsibility for some of their misery. He is a passionate supporter of gender equality.

Overcoming challenges in a changing world
National and international experts initiated a dialogue titled Climate Reality  Threats, Responses and Opportunities in a Changing World during an inaugural forum initiated by Dilmah Conservation, together with Global Compact Network Sri Lanka, Biodiversity Sri Lanka and Citra Innovations Lab, at the BMICH in Colombo, recently.
The forum brought in like-minded individuals from the government, private and academic sectors, for an open discussion on the alarming aspects presented by climate change, as well as to find new solutions by merging collective capacities of entrepreneurial and start-up networks engaged in climate change adaptation and innovation.
Dilmah Conservation CEO and United National Global Compact Network Sri Lanka Chair Dilhan C. Fernando said, Human existence is intricately and irrevocably linked to our natural environment: we are all environmentalists by necessity. Our focus today is on the future, as there are grounds for guarded optimism.
The increase in development and adoption of sustainable technologies, climate-smart agriculture and knowledge of how we might adapt to the new reality in our world, has been unprecedented during the past decade.
It is evident today, that there is far greater potential and opportunity in climate-smart agriculture, production and lifestyles than in holding on to the past, he added.
Key speakers of the event; Indian World Resources Institute Adaptation Strategy Head Dr. A. Nambi Appadurai, Conservation Scientist and Fellow at Australian Museum Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, Peradeniya University Agriculture Department Principal Agro-climatology Scientist Dr. B.V. R. Punyawardena and Climate Change Secretariats Climate Change Division Director Dr. SunimalJayathunga; along with panelists Forest Department Conservator General Anura Sathurusinghe and United National Global Compact Network Sri Lanka Chair Dilhan C. Fernando, revealed facts on climate change: visible threats, impacts, opportunities and economic potential available for the private sector in active engagement in climate response.
Climate change and diversity of life
Comparing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to the pulse of planet, Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda highlighted the catastrophic impact it could have on marine and terrestrial ecosystemsocean acidification, disrupted food chains, canopy dieback, species displacement and migration was said to increase at the current rate of rise in greenhouse gases and global warming.
Highlighting the ability of trees to arrest atmospheric carbon dioxide, he said, Forest restoration is central to climate resilience.
Long-term restoration projects are required to re-establish native plant species, as they take generations to grow.
Perspectives for agricultural sector
Computer simulations suggest an increase in temperatures by over three degrees centigrade in the Central Highlands and the Northern Province at the turn of the century, Dr. B.V. R. Punyawardena said, while citing evidence on existing climate projections.
Although the annual rainfall remains unaffected, anomalies in rainfall patterns combined with spikes in temperature during night-time, could negatively impact the agricultural sector, resulting in reduced yields and food shortages, he added.
Dr. Appadurai said that providing financial assistance to tea growersa sector which is of tremendous socio-economic importance for Sri Lankaoffers a greater potential to increase the rate of adoption of good climate resilient practices which could consequently minimise adverse effects of climate change on the tea industry.
Economic projections
Sri Lankas estimated climate-smart investment potential in key sectors would be more than $18 billion between 2018 to 2030, Dr. A. N. Appadurai said, adding that Sri Lanka could lose up to 1.2 percent of annual GDP growth per year by 2050 due to climate change, if appropriate interventions and investments were not made. The private sector thus, had an important role in meeting investment needs in key areas such as urban development, industrial parks, public-private partnerships (PPPs) and large-scale project implementation such as waste management and agriculture.
Dr. Pethiyagoda highlighted the exigency for the corporate sector to look beyond immediate profits and deliverables and instead, ensure that business interests were aligned more towards the demands of the future, both economically and environmentally. He also addressed the need for businesses to readily adapt to new-emerging technologies.
Prospects for the future
As consumers are becoming more environmentally-responsible and conscious, there is an opportunity for sustainable businesses to grow. The Climate Entrepreneurs Foruma spinoff materialised from the eventlooks towards a collaboration between young innovators and private sector companies that would facilitate climate-responsive initiatives aligning with national climate adaptation strategies.
Financial and technical support from the private sector is a key determinant in developing climate smart initiatives that offer both, simple and practical solutions.
The forum would continue towards more advanced discussions aimed at sharing innovative ideas on responses to climate change, and upscaling them for designing more concrete outputs.
****
Farmers across the globe are experiencing more droughts, floods, and heat waves due to climate change. This added unpredictability has contributed to food insecurity, damaged supply chains, exacerbated debt and made nations more vulnerable to poverty.
 Dr. B.V. R. Punyawardena.
Restoring Sri Lankas iconic ancient cascade system will be one of the best ways to address climate change in the dry zone: Sri Lanka has more than 42,000 ancient tanks that could be restored and used in climate change adaptation.
 Dr. Sunimal Jayathunga.

Psychedelic jungle plant that gives a near-death experience
A traditional jungle plant can create a 'near-death experience' when consumed, research has found.
Ayahuasca, which natives in Central and South America drink in liquid form, is used to create the psychedelic drug known as Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). And while the drug is illegal in most countries, its link with spirituality is widely acknowledged.
The powerful hallucinogen is usually used for ceremonial purposes in South America and has earned the nickname "the spirit molecule."
A study has found a "large overlap" between the effects of the drug, and descriptions of so-called near death experiences (NDEs).
Researchers from Imperial College London provided 13 volunteers with DMT and they completed a questionnaire afterwards.
Their responses were compared to those of a sample of 67 people, who have previously had NDEs. Each of the groups reported visions of bright light and the feeling outside of the body. There was also an experience of travelling through a void, inner peace and a sense of transitioning to a new world. Similarities happen because the drug and NDEs trigger similar processes in the brain.
Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, lead author of the study in the journal Frontiers in Psychology, told the MailOnline that studying the effects of DMT would help scientists 'better understand the psychology and biology of dying'.

Although the Rajapaksas spoke highly of the development of villages during their regime, it was still inefficient, State Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said.
He was addressing state officials, private sector institution representatives and councillors in the Hambantota district, during a meeting on the Gamperaliya project held at the Weeraketiya Divisional Secretariat, recently.
The state minister said that the views and ideas of those who participated in the meeting, would be given consideration when implementing the project.
He said that during the previous regime, development projects were implemented in villages according to the whims of ministers henchmen, and not based on the requirements of the villagers.
However, he said the Gamperaliya project would be used for the benefit of underprivileged villagers only, in order to raise their livelihoods.
State Minister Wedaarachchi said that women would be provided with employment opportunities, while the industrial and agricultural sectors would be developed as well.

## Title: The Right to Pray

The Right to Pray
The right to pray by all is under threat from the mid 90s in this country. In the aftermath of particularly violent outbursts, the statistics come to the fore. In the interim, the slow burning fires continue their work in this country. Very recently, this writer came across an ongoing situation in which a member of the clergy had summoned another from a different faith, been rude and boisterous and demanded that all construction work on a land owned by a particular group be stopped, sell the land and leave the area as he does not trust that group as they convert Buddhists.
He had further threatened that if the preacher were to fail to follow his orders, the consequences will be serious and he will not be responsible.
He had brought the villages to the temple that afternoon and visited the site with about 25-50 people that evening and instructed the neighbours to boycott the preacher and to stop giving water and any other help. This story is replicated scores of times.
Three-quarters of the worlds people live in countries that either restrict the right to religion or belief or have a high level of social hostility involving religion or belief, the U.N. special investigator on religious rights has said.
Ahmed Shaheed told the General Assemblys human rights committee that religious intolerance is prevalent globally - and rising around the world. He said over 70 countries currently have anti-blasphemy laws that can be used to suppress dissenting views, in violation of international human rights standards.
For the groups in pray it is a terrifying existence and a crude and sacrilegious violation of an inalienable right of every human being.
Religion is a number of worlds, within a world
Rev. Duleep de Chickera, at a panel discussion on the topic Religion Reconciliation and Future had these words of wisdom.
It is vast, it is varied, it is controversial, contradictory and complex. During different periods in the history of human kind, religions have gone like this; up and down, spreading conflict, discrimination, initiating violence against people and cultures and other religions and so on.If religion is to impact in the process of reconciliation there are one or two aspects of conflict that religion must try and comprehend. The first, again stating the obvious, is that conflict recurs  whether it is personal or social. So within history, we are not going to reach a state in which there will be no conflict. Consequently, the responsibility of religion is to respond to conflict in such a way that if there is grievance it is addressed and justice must be done.
If there is potential to harm that must be reduced or eliminated, if there are lessons to be learnt, they must be learnt. And there must be growth as far as possible, of the different segments that belong to that particular society. Humans are built on values. So that they will respond to good and evil, in such a way that, evil will be dealt with the way evil needs to be dealt with and good survive and good will be able to be sustained.
So the formation, the writing of values, into the personality and character of people is an investment, that religion is compelled to make, if religion takes reconciliation seriously.
If there are extremists within the Christian church it becomes the primary responsibility of moderates within the Christian church to address them. And to address them in terms of Christian doctrine and teachings of Christ, and so on. Similarly in Islam, similarly in Buddhism and all other religions, Hinduism included.
Now when this happens you see, you find that the gap of distrust gradually shrinks.
Currently followers under threat cover in private dwellings, helpless and fearfulof religious intolerance and violent attacks. The Police have a thankless task of separating groups and maintaining peace. We are not making much progress. However people of many faiths, in times of trouble seek divine intervention and guidance. They cross boundaries of their own original faith. Some whilst retaining their original religious identity, whilst others assume new faiths. Even if they dont, people visit places of worship of other denominations to pray. Its an ongoing process which no clergy can police. The clergy must also not acquire powers of policing. Common law must apply to all including members of the clergy. In very many instances where prayer groups are under attack, they choose a non-confrontational path of deference to those objecting to their right to choose a faith to pray. It emboldens the aggressive attackers to further acts of violence.
This scourge of religious intolerance being a global phenomenon will not leave us alone in the immediate future. If we were to remain indifferent to the ramifications, it will grow and provide fodder for significant civil strife in time to come soon.

Specific provisions in the Penal Code relating to hate speech
Section 290: Injuring or defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class.
Section 290A: Acts in relation to places of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class.
Section 291: Disturbing a religious assembly.
Section 291A: Uttering words with deliberate intent to wound religious feelings.
Section 291B: Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class, by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.
****
Promote greater religious tolerance and pluralism
The promotion of greater religious tolerance and pluralism bridges mistrust between the different religious communities and ethnic groups though promotion and awareness of cultural diversity learning of each others languages, religion cultures, beliefs is what we need to be doing. The formation and the writing of values referred by Rev. Chickera earlier is so essential. This is common sense. Legislation alone is not enough. A comprehensive approach is needed, including preventive measures, dialogue, education, promotion of tolerance and pluralism.

SL suffers Rs 150-250 bn loss  due to GSP+ withdrawal
Sri Lanka due to the loss of its GSP+ concession in August 2010 accounted a loss of export revenues till the reinstatement of GSP+ in May 2017 to the tune of Rs 150-250 billion according to a study done by Ministry of Development Strategies & International Trade.
According to the International Trade Centre, Vietnam, Pakistan and Cambodia all trailed Sri Lanka in 2009, with EU exports at US$ 2.1 billion, US$ 1.5 billion and US $ 1.09 billion, respectively, against Sri Lankas US$ 2.3 billion.
However by 2015, Vietnams apparel exports to the EU had risen to US$ 3.9 billion, Pakistans to US$ 2.9 billion and Cambodias to US$ 3.7 billion, with Sri Lanka trailing at US$ 2.4 billion.
The European Union (EU) reinstated the EU GSP Plus facility to Sri Lanka with effect from May 19, 2017. Importantly, this will provide Sri Lankan exports a level playing field with other countries such as our neighbours from Bangladesh & Pakistan, and several countries from Africa and South America who enjoy preferential market access.
The additional tariff concession gained by sectors varies  in many apparels categories duties are cut from 9.6 percent to zero, in the seafood sector from 18.5 percent to zero, in the fresh and processed fruits and vegetable sector from 12.5 percent to zero, in the porcelain and ceramic ware sector from 8.4 percent to zero and in the toy products sector from 1.2 percent to zero.
Apparel is by far Sri Lankas export to the EU.
Sri Lanka will continue to be eligible for GSP Plus as long as the periodic reviews (the first one coming in less than a year) by the EU do not raise any red flags with regard to the implementation of agreed human rights and governance reforms.
According to the Ministry 12 months after regaining GSP+, overall, EU exports were up by 11% in the 12 months after regaining GSP.
Apparel volume growth has outstripped revenue by 1-2%, suggesting modest sharing of pricing benefit with customers.
In the last two months exports have been strong. An estimate of the increase in jobs for the apparel sector along is at least 7,500.
Sri Lanka has already achieved an increase in exports of US$150m which is one third of the target of US$ 500 million increment for the apparel sector.
In addition other notable export growth sectors are fisheries and tyres too shave shown positive results. Fisheries volume of exports has literally doubled since the removal of the fish ban and regaining GSP plus  business links restored and new orders received.
Rubber tyres and gloves volume growth is lower than value, suggesting benefits from pricing increases and/or the strengthening Euro.

Star wrestler Kumar suffers shock Asian Games defeat
JAKARTA, Sunday: Indias two-time Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar bowed out of the Asian Games on Sunday, but said he felt no pressure after his shock opening-round defeat in the 74kg wrestling category in Jakarta.
The 35-year-old medal favourite went out with a whimper to Adam Batirov from Bahrain as he let slip a 2-1 lead to lose 3-5, despite vocal support from Indian fans.
I was also not expecting this result. I had prepared, but wins and losses are all part and parcel of sport, Kumar told reporters, saying he does not take criticism to heart.
There is no loss of stamina at this age. And no pressure as well. I come far from all that. I enjoy sports and will continue to do that, he added.
Kumars chance of making the repechage round also went up in smoke after Batirov lost his quarter-final to Japans Yuhi Fujinami. If Batirov had made the final, Kumar would have had a chance to win bronze through repechage.
Chinas Sun Yang completes swimming golden slam
Chinese giant Sun Yang swept to Asian Games 200m freestyle gold Sunday to add to his Olympic and world titles -- then had his national anthem played twice after a flag-pole malfunction.
The triple Olympic champion produced a blistering last two laps to clock one minute, 45.43 seconds and successfully launch his quest to win five gold medals in Jakarta.
Victory was twice as sweet for Sun, who was stunned by Japans Kosuke Hagino at the last Asian Games in 2014 and also took silver behind Korean rival Park Tae-hwan in 2010.
From the moment Sun strode out sporting a bright yellow tracksuit and huge red headphones to roars from flag-waving Chinese fans, there was only ever likely to be one winner.
The 26-year-old favourite absolutely smashed the final, finishing more than a second clear of Japans Katsuhiro Matsumoto, celebrating by screaming out loud and punching the air as he soaked up the applause of his adoring fans.
Bizarrely his moment of glory was soured somewhat when the flags fell off the pole during Chinas national anthem, prompting Sun to growl at officials and demand a do-over.
But flustered Games officials did away with the faulty pole altogether and simply held the flags.
Earlier, Sun showed a softer side to his gnarly public image by lavishing compliments on rival Hagino.
The controversial Chinese sparked a diplomatic row at the 2014 Asian Games when he branded the Japanese national anthem ugly.
Chinas Wang Jianjiahe won the womens 1,500m freestyle title after beating countrywoman Li Bingjie in a battle of 16-year-old schoolgirls, the national champion touching in 15:53.68, just over a tenth quicker than her close friend.
Liu Yaxin won the womens 200m backstroke in 2:07.65, before world champ Xu Jiayu celebrated his 23rd birthday by capturing gold in the mens 100m backstroke (52.34) to make it four out of four on the night for China.
Japan stopped the rot as Satomi Suzuki won the womens 100m breaststroke in a Games record 1:06.40, before Daiya Seto retained his 200m butterfly title in a time of 1:54.53.
China win gold, silver at shooting range
Chinas champion duo Ji Xiaojing and Wu Jiayu won the gold medal in the 10m mixed air pistol at the Asiad on Sunday, while Indias teenage shooting sensation made a disappointing early exit.
Ji, 30, and Wu, 21, saw off Korea in the final, adding the Asian Games title to their cabinet after setting a new world record of 487.7 in April at the World Cup in Changwon, Korea.
The pair -- world number four and six respectively -- scored 473.2 on Sunday, short of their best but enough to edge Koreans Kim Minjung and Lee Daemyung into second place with Vietnam bagging bronze.
Indias gold hopefuls Manu Bhaker, 16, and Abhisek Verma, 28, ended up bowing out in sixth place, missing out on a place in the finals.
Chinas victory will help offset their earlier result in the 10m mixed air rifle event, in which the country narrowly lost to rivals Taiwan to take silver against teenager Lin Yingshin and her teammate Lu Shaochuan. - AFP

## Title: TAVI: A Game Changer in Heart Surgery
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Monday, August 20, 2018 - 01:00
TAVI: A Game Changer in Heart Surgery
The aortic valve is like a one-way gate that regulates blood flow from the heart to the rest of the body. The valve opens to allow the heart to pump blood to other organs, and closes to prevent blood from flowing backward into the heart.
With ageing, the aortic valve may become narrowed, in a condition known as aortic valve stenosis. When the narrowing becomes severe, patients develop breathlessness, fainting spells and chest discomfort due to a lack of oxygen-rich blood. If left untreated, the disease can be deadly, with up to 50% of patients dying within 2 years. Dr Chiam Toon Lim Paul, cardiologist at Singapores Mount Elizabeth Hospital, explains how transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) features in the treatment of this condition and how TAVI is a game changer in heart surgery.
Limitations of open heart surgery
Open heart surgery has been the conventional method to treat aortic valve stenosis. Replacing the aortic valve relieves patients of their symptoms and prolongs their life span. However, the surgical risk for open heart surgery is high for many elderly patients and for patients with debilitating diseases, such as poor heart function, severe lung disease and end-stage kidney failure. In fact, some of these patients are even considered inoperable.
Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
As an alternative to open heart aortic valve replacement, the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was first performed on a no surgical option patient in 2002. In this minimally invasive method, a small incision is first made in the patients groin. Thereafter, a new valve is delivered through a catheter (or a tube) into the heart and implanted within the patients native aortic valve.
Although TAVI is mostly performed via a small puncture in the groin, other access sites may be required in a very small number of patients, such as through the chest artery or the left ventricular apex of the heart. The groin approach, also known as true percutaneous (via skin), is the least invasive and thus preferred.
Benefits of TAVI
Unlike open heart surgery, the patient undergoing TAVI does not need the chest cracked open, the heart is not stopped when implanting the transcatheter heart valve onto the beating heart, the native aortic valve is not removed and the newly implanted transcatheter valve does not need to be stitched in place. The groin approach procedure can also be done under local anaesthesia.
Several large randomised studies have shown the efficacy and safety of the TAVI technology. For instance, the PARTNER trial showed that TAVI was better than aortic valve ballooning, which uses a balloon to widen the narrowed heart valve, in inoperable patients. The trial also found that TAVI was as effective as open heart surgery. In addition, the CoreValve trial demonstrated that TAVI was better than open heart surgery in high-risk patients. From these data, TAVI has established itself as the treatment of choice for inoperable patients, and may be a better and safer treatment option for patients with high surgical risk.
For patients with moderate surgical risk, TAVI has also become a less invasive option. In a sub-analysis of patients who underwent the groin approach TAVI treatment, TAVI had a lower rate of consequent disabling stroke or death, and was thus better than open heart surgery.
Nonetheless, Dr Chiam qualifies that although the risk of stroke associated with TAVI is similar or lower than open heart surgery, there remains significant absolute risk of stroke at 2  5%, as with any heart surgery. This is an important consideration as low-risk and younger patients increasingly undergo TAVI.
A safer and viable treatment option
Nonetheless, Dr Chiam adds that several devices have been developed to reduce the risk of stroke associated with heart treatments by filtering debris before it reaches the brain or deflect debris away from the brains blood supply.
In addition, new generation transcatheter heart valves can now be repositioned if the initial implant position is deemed suboptimal, and can even be removed if a smaller or larger sized valve is required. This increases the accuracy and safety of the procedure. Some valves also improve sealing of the transcatheter heart valve against the native tissue, thereby reducing the problem of leakage due to tiny gaps between the new implanted valve and the native tissue.
These new generation valves have indeed been a game changer, with improvements made over a short span of time. The recent addition of the cerebral protection device in TAVI also offers many patients with severe aortic valve stenosis a safer and viable treatment option. - www.asiaone.com

A Touch of the wild...
Ornamental wildflower meadows create spectacular colour and make a diverse environment that will be loved my birds and insects. They are perfect for bringing new life to an unused part of the garden.
Flowering meadow patches and borders are also low maintenance and cheap to produce; the seeds germinate quickly and can fill an empty plot in just a few months. Surprisingly, perennial wildflowers like the hard life. They require impoverished soil, because if it is too rich you will get mostly leaves and few flowers. So its best to grow a wildflower meadow in a spot you dont usually cultivate, or one you havent used for a while.
However, if you have richer soil you can grow an annual flower meadow using cornfield flowers. This is the best option if you want to convert an existing bed with good soil.
Give your spare space a good weeding before sowing anything, as weeds will compete for light, space and food. Once youve removed everything, dig over the soil and firm it back down before raking it smooth.
Scatter your wildflower meadow seeds by hand. Rake in lightly and water thoroughly. If youre particularly worried about birds eating them all, put some netting over the soil.
Make sure the soil remains moist and warm while theyre germinating. The key thing is to make sure they dont dry out. A single blisteringly hot weekend will stop them in their tracks. And watch out for weeds coming back too.
Deadhead the flowers as they grow to prolong flowering. Leave the plants to self-seed at the end of the growing season  they should come back up next year.
Clear away the old plants in spring to let the new ones get light. Again, keep on top of weeds to stop them taking over.
You may need to sow more seeds for the first few years, but after that they should come back every year with no extra work from you.

The trouble with designing a book when its author is in jail
As a senior designer at Alfred A. Knopf, I feel incredibly lucky. Odds are, if Im passed a manuscript to read, I will love it. And when Im assigned a novel by a first-time author, an excited, anxiety-driven energy overcomes me. With no prior writing of the authors to research, I must build from scratch. Its sort of like learning someones deepest secrets the first time you meet them. Theres also the pressure to accurately visualize their voice while still pleasing numerous publishing factions: editors, agents, publishers, sales. Sometimes I wonder if its even possible.
Over the years, I have learned it is very easy to become pigeon-holed into designing certain types of books. For example, when I became engaged to my husband, I received a flood of freelance work for novels about women and their marriages. As a result, I now always try to navigate my work and choose subjects that grant me the opportunity to be more versatile.
Unique voice
After more trial and error, the sketch below was well received. After a few tweaks, both the editor and publisher were on board.
Although I already design for a satisfying range of literary genres, last summer I asked my creative director if I could work on a book she wouldnt normally think to give me. She was kind enough to entertain my request, and assigned me Nico Walkers Cherry.
Nico has a blunt and unique voice. Between the gruesome war scenes, the agonizing PTSD, and the dark rabbit hole of drug addiction were fragmented moments of hilarity, love, and goodness. I was surprised at my empathy for this nameless character. He may have robbed multiple banks and held people at gun point, but he did so politely!
Nico wrote this novel on a typewriter in a federal prison. Hes currently finishing out his sentence with about one more year to go. He has limited access to text-only emails, and they must be sent through a portal and approved by authorities. It could take over a week for him to read a single message.
For the sake of saving time, the editor decided it was best to show Nicos literary agent first. Not your typical agent, but the manager of the Mississippi-based independent record label Fat Possum Records. I eagerly waited to hear back.
Book jacket
A love story in that Natural Born Killers type of way. But a title like Cherry presented a dilemma. I thought showing love would elude to unfortunate sexual connotations.
I used an exercise, mocking up the work of some of my favorite artists, to help me better visualize a solution. While there was probably no way I would have been allowed to use any of the art below on a book jacket, I gave it a tryin hindsight probably mostly to amuse myself:
I still felt the idea of showing romance as the primary focus was misleading. I expressed this to the editor, and while he did like the type treatment of these, he agreed.
And so there were more . . .
But they received little excitement.

Usha Uthup: Let there be music
India and Sri Lanka share a timeless bond that encompasses religion, culture, language and of course, music. When the Indian High Commission in Sri Lanka contemplated the best way to celebrate the 71st Freedom day, it opted for the latter. India has many world-class musicians, but none could have fitted the occasion like Usha Uthup, a big fan of Radio Ceylon which helped mould her career in the initial stages. With her ability in to sing in Sinhala, Tamil and English, she is the ideal cultural ambassador from India.
Her Freedom Day concert at the BMICH, Colombo was appropriately titled Symphony of Freedom. And what a symphony it turned out to be for the 1,600 people who flocked to the BMICH. The main hall was overflowing and there were many who watched the concert standing. The concert was dedicated to the youth  who were the majority in the audience anyway.
The audience got a glimpse of her truly global outlook when she started off with a perfect rendition of the Bee Gees/Boyzone love song Words. She worked the audience on this one, giving them the microphone to complete the chorus  Its only words, and words are all I have to take your heart away. And she did take our hearts away with her words.
In fact, Usha or Didi as she is affectionately known, gave every possible chance for the audience to sing and clap along with her regardless of the song being performed. It was a wonderful audience that knew almost every song by heart.
Didi got things moving, recalling how she met James Bond in 1969, an experience that apparently left her Shaken and Stirred (Didi, My name is Bond, James Bond). This could have been a reference to the real-life Sean Connery, who had acted in You Only Live Twice in 1967 and whose next outing as Bond would come in 1971 in Diamonds are Forever. Bond, of course, had complimented her on her good looks (Didi is still youthful despite her advancing years). All this talk of James Bond led to her next song Skyfall, which was first performed by Adele for the Bond film of the same title starring Daniel Craig. This was a remarkable performance, made all the more entertaining by visuals from Skyfall projected on to the screen on the stage.
Next up was the immortal love song Stand by Me originally performed by Ben E King. It is always nice to hear a woman singing this melodious song  When the night has come And the land is dark, And the moon is the only light well see, No I wont be afraid, no I wont be afraid, Just as long as you stand, stand by me.
The audience was eager to listen to the song that started it all  Hare Krishna Hare Rama, her very first movie songs shared with the legendary Asha Bhosle. This she delivered straight from the heart, accompanied by visuals from the 1971 Dev Anand film of the same name co-starring Mumtaz and Zeenat Aman. This stirred many audience members to clap and virtually dance in their seats. There was an equally rapturous reception to her next number,Mera Laung Gawacha, the Punjabi hit song originally sung by Musarrat Nazir and made even more popular by DJ Bally Sagoo through a remix.
One of the best moments of the concert came when out of the blue, she began to sing the evergreen Sinhala Baila Hit Kandy Lamissi followed by the world famous Indo-pop party song Bombay Meri Hai which was originally sung by Didis elder sister Uma Pocha who passed away recently. The song was penned by the legendary musician Mina Kava on a request by the recording company HMV to write a song about his city Bombay, now called Mumbai. Incidentally, Pocha herself had performed this very song in Colombo with the group Spitfires in 1970, just one year after its debut.
The song, which shared the same beat as Sri Lankan Baila, had already become a hit by then in Sri Lanka thanks to the Lankan pop group Jetliners, who were the house band at the discothque of the iconic Taj Mahal Hotel in Mumbai in the 1970s. They even recorded two albums when they were in the city: The Jetliners Go Go at Blow Up and The Jetliners at the Taj Mahal Bombay. There is also a Sinhalese version of the song called Ran Ran Ran (Gold Gold Gold). Ushas performance of Bombay Meri Hai was nothing less than pure gold.
Then, without missing a beat, she went onto another Sinhala Baila hit  Yaman Bando Vesak Balanna (Banda, lets go see Vesak) originally sung by the inimitable Desmond de Silva. Again, she let the audience sing the song along with her and at one point mildly chided the audience for getting the lyrics wrong. I am going to teach you she said laughing and sang it brilliantly and perfectly. Didi told the audience that it is the one Sinhala song that she regularly performs worldwide, which of course resulted in a thunderous clap.
Didi would have left a huge vacuum if she did not perform a Tamil song and what a song it was  the enormously popular worldwide hit Kolaveri Kolaveri also known as Why This Kolaveri Di (why this murderous rage, girl) originally performed by South Indian artist Dhanush in 2012 for the movie 3. Sung in a light-hearted mixture of Tamil and English called Tanglish, the song about a young mans failed love affair virtually crashed the Internet. Didi then performed a popular Malayalam song, after asking the Malayalam speakers in the audience to raise their hands. There were only a few, but no matter, the song captured the hearts of everyone.
That was the very essence of her show  it was an arrow that pierced every music lovers heart. She was helped in this endeavor in no small measure by her four-man backup band. When the time came for the curtains to come down after nearly two hours, she asked the audience to light up their smartphones and sway along to the music, which they did. It was a magical moment  the darkness of the hall, the pinpoints of light and Didis mellifluous voice all coming together for one final assault on the senses.

Usha Uthup was born on November 7, 1947 in Bombay, India as Usha Vaidyanath Someshwar Sami. Her first public singing occurred when she was nine. Her sisters who were already exploring a music career, took her to the most popular radio announcer in India that time called Ameen Sawani who gave her an opportunity to sing on the Ovaltine Music Hour in Radio Ceylon. She sang a number called Mockingbird Hill. After that, several appearances followed through her teenage years.
Usha Uthup affectionately called Didi started singing in a small nightclub in Chennai called as Nine Gems in the basement of the erstwhile Safire theatre complex on Mount Road, when she was 20, wearing a saree and leg calipers. Her performance was so well received that the owner of the nightclub asked her to stay on for a week. Her next engagement took her to Delhi where she sang at the Oberoi hotels. A film crew belonging to Navketan unit and Shashi Kapoor visited the nightclub and they offered her a chance to sing movie playback. As a result, she started her Bollywood career with Ivory-Merchants Bombay Talkies (1970) in which she sang an English number under Shanker-Jaikishan and then the famous hit Hare Rama Hare Krishna. Then her career took off.
She sings in more than 16 Indian languages including Tamil and more than 10 world languages including English and Sinhala. She has held concerts around the world including in Sri Lanka. She has performed songs for hundreds of Hindi and other movies and also acted in several movies. She has also appeared in numerous TV and radio shows. An unofficial ambassador for India and Indian values, Usha speaks the Universal Language of Music and continues to amaze audiences around the world. As recognized by the Government of Kenya for her contribution to Swahili music, she is a true Citizen of the World.

Vajpayee: true friend of Sri Lanka: PM
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the late Atal Bihari Vajpayee was an outstanding Prime Minister of India and a true friend of Sri Lanka who always stood by Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he was grateful to the former Indian Prime Minister in this respect.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the Indian High Commission in Colombo on August 19 morning and signed the condolence book on the demise of former Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he first came to know Vajpayee in 1975. He had been in jail for sometime. In 1977, Vajpayee was appointed Foreign Minister of India under the government of Prime Minister Desai.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that subsequent to his appointment as Deputy Foreign Minister of Sri Lanka in 1977, he was able to further cement his friendship with Vajpayee.
Neighbouring countries hailed Vajpayee as a good foreign Minister, the Prime Minister said. He took the side of Sri Lanka during its difficult times. Vajpayee strongly believed that Indo-Sri Lanka friendship should always be protected, the Prime Minister said.
The two of them also met as opposition leaders of their respective countries later. They continued their friendship when Vajpayee became Prime Minister of India and he had even given his private contact number to him.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that when he became Prime Minister, the LTTE had became a strong outfit and security forces had been on the retreat.
The economy was in shambles. Against this background, Vajpayee assisted Sri Lanka to develop its economy and train its security forces.
If not for this help, we could not march forward successfully later, he said.
Vajpayee assisted us to combat the sea tiger movement. He could be described as a leader who had great interest in Sri Lankas well-being, the Prime Minister said.
From 2009 to 2010, Vajpayee suffered from failing health and his visitors were restricted.
The great service he had rendered during the history of India can never be forgotten, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

A crowd supporting Rajapaksa and media personnel had gathered at the premisespressed around the former President as he walked out after nearly three hours interrogation. The video, which was making rounds in the social media, shows that the seemingly miffed former President was slightly pushing Lokubandara back in to the crowd with angry remarks, Me anna arehata vela inna. Lokubandara was seen shocked by the unexpected comment.
The social media was abuzz over the weekend over how the former President publicly humiliated his own loyal official.
The post had been shared by many on Twitter and Facebook earning a large number of comments.
Following the incident, the former President gave a voice cut to the media over the CID interrogation.
He told the media that he cannot remember whether he received calls urging his intervention to save the life of Keith Noyahr.

Visa on arrival vital to boost tourism - Anusha Frydman
Sri Lanka Tourism should once again convince the government to issue visa on arrival for Europeans, US and USA and other selected nationals and look at offering short term Visit Visa for SAARC countries said Managing Director, Anusha de Alwis Frydman, Managing Director, Lavanga Resort and Spa Hikkaduwa.
Speaking to Daily News she said that there is tremendous tourism potential within the SAARC region and Sri Lankan Tourism should try to exploit this. For Indians sometimes it takes a short time to travel to Sri Lanka rather than flying within the country. In addition there is good air connectivity and authorities should look at offering a short stay free visa system for them.
She also said that for Europeans though the visa to Sri Lanka is economical and not difficult to obtain its being offered for a limited period and this should be re looked at.
Anusha Frydman said that the government must seriously re look at the tax structure for the hotel sector which is now high. The government must offer a better tax deal for SME hotels like us and have a separate tax structure for large Chain hotels.

She said that this will on the long run help for more investments and help larger job creation from the industry.
Having first started as a guest relations officer at Coral Rock hotel Hikkaduwa straight after leaving Southlands College Galle, she said that today there is less taboo for females to work in the leisure industry.
She worked for a salary around Rs. 3,000 and then came to Colombo studied at British Council and also worked in shipping companies. During this time she saw a vacancy advertisement in Daily News calling for Guest Relations offices at Galle Face Hotel and joined it working under seasoned hotelier Anura Lokuhetty.
Moving on to work for another hotel chain she met and married Australian entrepreneur and architect, Daniel Frydman and invested in Lavanga Resort and Spa Hikkaduwa. The hotel was first built on bare land as a 16 room all-suite hotel along with whom she met while working in Colombo. Since the demand for the hotel increased we decided to add 30 additional deluxe rooms and have one of the biggest banquets halls in the area.
She said that under the third phase of the hotel development they added 16 more budget rooms after acquiring an adjoining land and have built two bridges to connect the two buildings.
A mother of three Anusha Frydman said that she sees better prospects for tourism.

Wallabies star Folau ruled out of second Bledisloe Test
SYDNEY: Wallabies star Israel Folau was Sunday ruled out of the second Bledisloe Cup Test with an ankle injury, in a further blow to Australia after their big loss to New Zealand.
Fullback Folau limped off in the 65th minute in the first Test in Sydney on Saturday, as the All Blacks thumped the Wallabies 38-13 in a clash that doubled as the Rugby Championship opener.
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika said the 29-year-old had a small tear in a muscle right down low but added that it was just a lot of swelling and not a long-term injury.
Were hopeful hell be back for the game in Brisbane against the Springboks, Cheika said.
I think its logical to bring in a winger like Naivalu as we have (Jack) Maddocks who can play winger and fullback as well as (Tom) Banks who is an out-and-out fullback. Brumbies pair Folau Faingaa and Rory Arnold, and Rebels centre Billy Meakes will also travel to Auckland to help with the Wallabies preparations.
The All Blacks have also been hit by injuries ahead of next weeks clash at Eden Park in Auckland, with Ryan Crotty and Rieko Ioane both sidelined.
The Wallabies have not won at Eden Park since 1986. They are due to face South Africa in Brisbane on September 8. AFP

Wealthy pets!
Have you ever watched a film or TV show and wondered how much an animal has gotten paid for the gig
Well, it turns out if theyre particularly good at their craft, they earn more than most of us combined. The Grumpy Cat meme, for example, was the gift that kept giving as the famous feline racked up a worth of $99,500,000 (78,199,040). Since the picture of the bemused cat went viral, shes had a film made about her, has her own merchandise empire and has a staggering 2.5m followers on Instagram. So who else makes up the rich pet list
The data, compiled by comparison website Compare the Market, found that the rich pet list was topped by a German Shephard called Gunther IV.
Gunther IV lives a bougie life; he eats steak and caviar and has multi-million dollar homes. Oh and hes worth more than Kim Kardashian.
Bart the Bear II is a famous actor who has appeared in loads of Hollywood films. One of his most recent roles was in Game of Thrones when he was pitted against Jamie Lannister and Brienne of Tarthe.
Gigoo is the richest chicken in the world, with a net worth of $15m (11,797,500). To put that into perspective, thats $2m (1,573,000) more than model Gigi Hadid.
Social media stars such as Juniper the Fox, Doug the Pug, and Lil Bub are all Insta famous pets. Doug has multiple celeb friends including Ed Sheehan and has also appeared in one of Fall Out Boys music videos. Which is more than any of us can say. Its not just cats and dogs that make up the list of rich pets. Bubbles the chimpanzee, Missy the cow, Csoki the African parrot, and Big Tibby the tortoise are also making some serious dosh. Metro

Wilson shines as Bournemouth beat West Ham 2-1
LONDON, Saturday - Striker Callum Wilson scored a stunning goal which helped Bournemouth come from behind in a 2-1 victory at West Ham United on Saturday and stretched their fine Premier League start to two wins in as many games.
West Ham, in contrast, slipped to the bottom of the table after a second successive defeat following a 4-0 drubbing by Liverpool in the opening round, piling early pressure on their new manager Manuel Pellegrini.
The Hammers looked set to claim their first win of the season after Marko Arnautovic drilled in a 33rd-minute penalty, awarded by referee Stuart Wilson after the linesman confirmed that Nathan Ake tripped Javier Hernandez.
But the tide turned in the second half after Austria striker Arnautovic wasted an excellent chance to double West Hams lead on the stroke of halftime, as keeper Asmir Begovic did well to save his fizzing low shot.
Wilson, who also missed a sitter in the opening half with the score 0-0, produced a breathtaking equaliser on the hour.
The striker powered his way past four defenders after picking the ball up at the halfway line and threaded it through the legs of West Ham keeper Lukasz Fabianski.
West Ham were reeling and defender Steve Cook completed Bournemouths comeback six minutes later, stooping to head a close-range header into the roof of the net off the ground after Ryan Fraser floated in a free kick from the right.
West Ham face an uphill task in the next round when they visit city rivals Arsenal and if their early form is anything to go by, the Hammers are in for a tough season.
A nightmare afternoon for Newcastle Uniteds loan signing Kenedy ended with the Brazilian having a penalty saved with almost the final kick of a dismal and goalless Premier League stalemate at Cardiff City.
With Newcastle down to 10 men after a straight red card for Isaac Hayden, Kenedy spurned a golden and unlikely chance to steal all three points, putting a seal on one of the most inauspicious individual displays seen in the Premier League.
The on-loan Chelsea winger, whose poor 96th minute spot kick was kept out by Neil Etheridge, should not even have been on the pitch after his wild kick out at Victor Camarasa went unseen by referee Craig Pawson in the first half.
Kenedy did not even complete a single pass during the first 45 minutes, the first time that indignity has befallen a Premier League outfield player since Blackburn Rovers Nikola Kalinic against Birmingham City in March 2010.

WORLD SALUTES KOFI ANNAN
SWITZERLAND: From his native Africa to the United States, tributes poured in from top leaders around the world Sunday after UN chief, Nobel Peace Laureate, and diplomatic rock star Kofi Annan died at the age of 80.
The Ghanaian national was a career diplomat who projected quiet charisma and was widely credited for raising the world bodys profile in global politics during his two terms as head of the UN from 1997 to 2006.
The first Secretary General from sub-Saharan Africa, Annan led the United Nations through the divisive years of the Iraq war and was later accused of corruption in the oil-for-food scandal, one of the most trying times of his tenure.
Annan astutely guided the United Nations organisation into the 21st century defining an ambitious agenda that had made the UN truly indispensable to peace, prosperity and human dignity around the world, Annans successor as UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, said in a statement.
Annans family said he had passed away peacefully on Saturday after a short illness.
Annan, who lived not far from the UN European headquarters in Geneva, died in hospital in the German-speaking part of the country, Swiss news agency ATS reported.
Current UN chief Antonio Guterres described his predecessor as a guiding force for good.
In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations, he said.
He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination. The UN said it would fly flags at half mast at all of its locations around the world through Tuesday.
And Ghanas President Nana Akufo-Addo announced a week of mourning for one of our greatest compatriots.
In 2001, as the world was reeling from the September 11 attacks in the United States, Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the world body for their work for a better organised and more peaceful world.
Another Nobel laureate, retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, described Annan as an outstanding human being who represented our continent and the world with enormous graciousness, integrity and distinction.
Born in Kumasi, the capital city of Ghanas Ashanti region, Annan devoted four decades of his working life to the UN and was the first chief to rise from within the organisations ranks.
In 1993, he took over as peacekeeping chief -- a position he held through two of the UNs darkest chapters: the Rwandan genocide and the Bosnian war.
His tenure as UN Chief was tarnished by a 2005 investigation of Annan and his son over the oil-for-food scandal, seen by some as payback for his comments that the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq was illegal.
An inquiry cleared Annan of any serious wrongdoing, but found ethical and management lapses linked to his son Kojos ties with a Swiss firm that won lucrative contracts in the oil-for-food scheme. Annan later admitted the scandal had sorely tested his mettle not only as secretary general, but as a father.
Despite the lows, he left the post as one of the most popular UN leaders ever, and was considered a diplomatic rock star in international diplomatic circles.
After ending his second term as UN chief, he kept up his diplomatic work, taking high-profile mediation roles in Kenya and in Syria, and more recently leading an advisory commission in Myanmar on the crisis in Rakhine state.
He enjoyed some success in ending post-election turmoil in Kenya in 2007, and on Saturday the two main players in that crisis, former president Mwai Kibaki and his opposition rival Raila Odinga celebrated his efforts.
Annan resigned from the peace mission for Syria in 2012 after just a few months, saying a Security Council stalemate had turned it into a mission impossible.
He also set up his foundation devoted to conflict resolution and joined the Elders group of statesmen which speaks out on global issues. But he had recently spoken of his despair at the state of global leadership and the lack of will to engage in resolving crises.
Honestly speaking, we are in a mess, he told AFP in an exclusive interview last December, warning that today, leaders are going in the wrong direction... leaders are withdrawing. Despite his criticism, current and former world leaders voiced their admiration for Annan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin hailed his wisdom and courage, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel celebrated the exceptional statesman in the service of the global community. President Donald Trump had yet to comment, but the US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said Annan worked tirelessly to unite us and never stopped fighting for the dignity of every person.
Former US president Barack Obama earlier said Annan embodied the mission of the United Nations like few others.
Kofi Annan was a truly great UN Secretary-General, former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement. - AFP

Country needs to increase  high tech exports
Sri Lanka exports only one percent of high tech products and to address the widening trade gap the country will have to increase its high tech exports, National Science Foundation (NSF) of Sri Lanka Chairperson Prof Sirimali Fernando said.
Addressing a gathering summoned to announce the 50th Anniversary celebrations of the NSF in Colombo recently, she said the recommendation was that a country should spend at least one percent of its GDP on research. But this is done only by developed countries and they invest more than one percent. South Korea invests five percent and USA and Israel four percent.
In the USA it was shown that 90% of its economic development is based on technology. But in Sri Lankas development agenda technological development had not got any prominence. We were so happy to get technology from outside and use it. But we didnt develop it. Even the industrys mind set was the same. Unless we spend the money on research wisely and invest in high-end technology we are not going to make it. She said the country faces a widening trade gap and if this is to be addressed the state has to increase the value of its experts. The only way to do that is by increasing the high tech exports, she said.
To overcome this situation the National Science Foundation is endeavouring hard to enhance the capacity of researches in the country and also come out with solutions to develop entrepreneurs and innovators so that high technology could be used for value added products, said National Science Foundation Director General Prof Ananda Jayawardane.
We actually export raw rubber; raw coconut and raw cinnamon and we need value added products to be developed. For this the Ministry of Primary Industries has commissioned a research project spending millions of rupees so that we can come out with solutions for different species and value added products in Sri Lanka.
Prof Jayawardane said for a country to develop it needed to invest on future education, research and development. He said Sri Lanka invested only 0 .106 of its GDP on R&D where as India allocated 0.6 of its GDP which is a colossal amount. Therefore the state needs to provide incentives to researches and motivate them. The research institutions in Sri Lanka are the lowest paid, he said.
Prof Jayawardane however said many initiatives has now been taken to overcome this situation .He said Rs 50 million has been allocated for cinnamon research project spanning over three years funded by the Ministry of Primary Industries. Long-established institutions such as the National Science Foundation have ensured throughout the years that Sri Lanka was steadily progressing in the right direction towards a promising future in advancing knowledge and technology, Minister Sarath Amunugama said. The NSF will celebrate 50 years of service excellence on October 4, 2018 as the countrys apex body powering the promotion of science, technology and innovation for the economic and social prosperity of Sri Lanka. The event will be held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.

Court case will let me reveal truth
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday welcomed a decision by Frontline Socialist Party to file a case against him (Rajapakshe) on his recent remarks against Frontline involvement in ragging at universities.
The Minister said that filing a case against him will give him an opportunity to expose the misdeeds of the FSP in public.
Minister Rajapakshe was speaking at a press briefing at Nawala yesterday afternoon. Higher Education Minister Rajapakshe said he is even ready to pay lawyers fees for the FSP as he could then expose the doings of the FSP at the hearings. Rajapakshe alleged that some raggers are sexually harass students under the influence of drugs.
Minister Rajaakshe said 400 complaints have been lodged against ragging in the last year.
Minister Rajapakshe said that he is carrying out a study with regard to the effectiveness of the leadership programme conducted for students.
I am having monthly discussions with University Vice Chancellors on this subject. Both plus and minus points in this programme. If the pros are larger than the cons, we will consider reviving the leadership programme, he said.

Service statute soon for Grama Niladharis
A service statute for Grama Niladharis was formulated to abolish official impediments that Grama Niladharis undergo when they perform administrative functions and implement State policies. The new ordinance will be implemented very soon, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardana said.
He was addressing the gathering at the inauguration ceremony of eight Nila Sevana Offices in the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat Division in Ambalangoda recently.
The Grama Niladhari Service is among the oldest State services. It has been since ancient kings time under various names. The Gammuladeni post was first replaced with the Grama Sevaka post in 1961. In 1989, it became the Grama Niladhari Service. Since then, this rural level administrative service lacked a service statute. Earlier, the Grama Niladhari Service had a parallel service statute. The Government Management Assistant Service abolished it. Thereafter, the Grama Seva Nilaadhari Service lacks a service statute from 1961, the Minister said.
We have now resolved the problem. We obtained views of Grama Niladhari trade unions. A special Committee studied and assessed the opinions and completed a new service statute. The draft will be submitted to the Cabinet for approval. The new ordinance will resolve many professional problems of the service, the Minister said.
Minister Abeywardana said Grama Niladharis suffer certain salary anomalies. When awarding grades and promoting Grama Niladharis, they undergo many issues. We want to ensure an efficient and competent Grama Nilaadhari Service through a proper service statue, the Minister said. The Home Affairs Ministry has launched a project to set up Nila Sevana Offices at Divisional Secretariats and one administrative centre will be set up in every Grama Niladhari Division under the project to facilitate the services of Grama Niladhari, Economic Development Officer, Agricultural Research Assistant and Samurdhi Officer, he said.

Moragahakanda, Wayamba development projects
Advancing towards a flourishing future
Pursuant to the launch of the Moragahakanda Multipurpose Development Project in early January, the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry, together with the Mahaweli Authority and related implementing agencies, had launched development initiatives that would further the benefits accrued from the Mahaweli Development project via the flow of Mahaweli water, to regions subjected to vagaries in weather patterns.
The North Western (Wayamba) Province Irrigation Canal Project had been initiated in order to ensure the provision of a continuous and steady water supply to the Anuradhapura, Kurunegala and Matale districts, which had been traditional agricultural basins throughout the history of the country.
Addressing longstanding issues
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had partnered the government in respect of three key components of the development initiative; namely the Upper Elahera project, Wayamba Province Irrigation Scheme, and the Minipe Left Bank Rehabilitation.
The project, which is to be implemented by 2024, would serve as a key component of the development work under the Moragahakanda Multipurpose Development Project in the said three districts, under two stages.
The project area covers the Dambulla, Naulla and Galewela Divisional Secretariat divisions in the Matale district; the Palagala Divisional Divisional Secretariat division in the Anuradhapura district; and the Polpithigama, Mahawewa, Ehetuwewa, Ambanpola and Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat divisions in the Kurunegala district.
In the North Western Province, the project would primarily focus on the northern areas, to address longstanding issues such as water scarcity.
Strengthening reservoir networks
During the first stage of the North Western (Wayamba) Province Irrigation Canal Project, a sum of Rs.16 billion would be disbursed to divert 105,000 acre-feet of Mahaweli water to the northern areas of the Kurunegala district, annually.
Twelve thousand five hundred hectares of land would also be cultivated to aid over 13,000 farmer families. The overall supply of water to the referred areas would be over 130 million cubic metres of water, of which 10 percent would be treated for drinking water supply.
More than 40,000 families in the areas would benefit overall, and the project would serve in the long run, to alleviate incidences of kidney disease as well as other water-borne illnesses prevalent in areas such as Polpithigama, and Nikawewa.
The Wayamba Province Irrigation Scheme would also serve to implement sub-schemes which would strengthen water reservoirs in Galewela, Wemadilla and Dewahuwa, and feed Mahaweli water to eight main tanks and 353 small tanks in the Mee Oya, Hakwatuna Oya and Kala Oya valley basins in the Central Province. It would be facilitated by setting up irrigation channels totalling 92 km in length.
Infrastructure development
Mahaweli water which would be diverted from the Lenadora-Dambulu Oya, would flow via the left side of Wemedilla embankment to the Maha Kithula and Maha Giriulla reservoirs. The water would thereafter be supplied through two main irrigation resources: the Maha Girillula reservoir to the Kaduru Wewa in Ehetuwewa, over a distance of 21 km and from the Maha Kithula reservoir to the Mediyawa tank, over a distance of 20 km.
Yapahuwa residents in a 1,000-acre land would also benefit from water from the Mediyawa irrigation canal over a distance of around 10 km, providing opportunities to undertake cultivation during both the Yala and Maha seasons.
In order to reach the above goals, the project would develop the required infrastructure in two phases. The main constructions activities would include while setting up a canal system totalling 96 km, construction of a sluice gate for the Wemedilla reservoir, construction of the Maha Kithula, Maha Giriulla and Dambe reservoirs, as well as construction of three tunnels: Ranwediyawa (400 metres), Neelagama (1000 metres) and Mahakithula (550 metres).
Minimising environmental impact
A critical and noteworthy factor relating to the said development work, are the stringent measures, as well as the commitment of Government of Sri Lanka, to minimise environmental impact while taking measures to sustain biodiversity at all locations where project activities are implemented.
The initial actions in this regard, had been taken through two biodiversity studies undertaken with assistance from EML Ltd. and the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), at the design stage of the Moragahakanda  Kalu Ganga Reservoir Project.
Flora and fauna, as well as fish that would be at risk due to the North Western Province Canal Project, would be relocated. The management of upper watersheds of the reservoirs being set up and renovated under the project, would be important components pursued in efforts to mitigate vulnerabilities caused by climate change in the Kurunegala, Matale and Anuradhapura districts.

Yasa Nanayakkara
Pillar of strength
It is with profound grief that I pen this appreciation on my beloved wife who was a pillar of strength to me. I fell in love with her when we were classmates and our bond continued unabated until we tied the nuptial knot on June 26, 1961.
She was a trained teacher. Immediately after our marriage, she was transferred to Royal College, Colombo, with effect from July 1, 1961. She continued therein and retired in 1991. I was a Management Assistant in the Education Department Head Office at Slave Island back then.
She was keen on tantalising my taste buds with her unsurpassed culinary prowess. I was also thrilled to bits with her mellifluous tete-a-tete.
Yasa was well-known for her generosity, warmth, graciousness, hospitality and wonderful smile. She was particularly mindful of the downtrodden and went all out to help them. It could be said that her left hand did not know what her right hand gave.
I have two children: a son and a daughter. Both of them are Australian citizens. Our son Gaya arrived when she was bedridden. He was chanting pirith when she breathed her last on July 25. My daughter arrived the same day and the funeral took place the following day. There was not a single moment when there were no visitors who came to pay their last respects to her. Her obituary notice appeared in the Daily News and the Lankadeepa on July 26, 2018.
I had the joy and privilege of being married to Yasa for almost 58 years. She was born on October 10, 1933. Together, we shared life's pleasures. Although my words cannot express how much I miss her everyday, I thought of sharing my life with everyone.
She was an adorable mother to her two children. I was very particular about a small family, which I could afford with my earnings. I have five grandchildren living in Australia. The eldest grandson, whom she loved very much, came down to pay his last respects as she was a doting grandmother. Yasa was devoted to her family and was the linchpin and rock of the family.
It was her greatest pleasure to contact her dear friends in Colombo. There were several of them. Nayana who was a dear and near friend, used to telephone her regarding bana preachings telecasted on Peo TV. Some of her friends and pupils arrived in Matara from Colombo, to pay their last respects to her.
My sweet darling Yasa, the indelible impressions that you have left in my heart are as vivid as ever. I pray that you be my partner in the long trek of sansara.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana as you have gathered sufficient merit.
Nanda Nanayakkara

Chandra Lal de Alwis
Personification of discipline
Without even the slightest trace of exaggeration, it could be said that Chandra Lal de Alwis was a symbol of loyalty and unswerving steadiness.
At our alma mater Mahinda College in Galle, he established a shining reputation as an exemplary student and sustained practitioner of ultra-mural activities. There was hardly any distinction he did not bag during his years at Mahinda.
He was a junior and a senior Cadet, as well as a member of the English debating team.
He was once the Head Prefect as well. Many Old Boys of Mahinda, contemporary to Lals years, fondly recall the friendship he extended to his college mates.
During Cadetting events, Chandra Lal de Alwis would go out of his way to ensure the safety of his fellow Cadets.
As a resident scholar, he was perpetually alert to the proper maintenance of the hostel premises. All this made him the personification of discipline and loyalty. One could even consider him a 'true Mahindian', embodying all the values the college stood for.
Bidding adieu to the academic world of Mahinda College, he stepped into the hum and buzz of the work-a-day world of Trade and Commerce. Among his outstanding achievements, the following should receive special reference: Chemanex PLC Managing Director, Senkadagala Finance Chairman, Japan-Sri Lanka Technical and Cultural Association President, China-Sri Lanka Business Association President, Chamber of Commerce President, as well as President of both the Japan-Sri Lanka and China-Sri Lanka Friendship Societies.
There too, displaying his loyalty and steadiness, Chandra Lal de Alwis, scaled the high peaks of business and industrial success.
Whatever the heights he achieved in the fields of Business, Trade, Commerce and Industry, both in Sri Lanka and abroad, he never forgot his alma mater.
Chandra Lal ushered in a fresh era for the Mahinda College Old Boys Association Colombo branch, when he took its helm as President in 2003. Focussed on training students and teachers alike, he launched a programme at the Sasakawa Institute. He guided the Mahinda College Old Boys Association Colombo branch for a decade.
He introduced the series of E. A. Wijesuriya Memorial Orations, as well as the 'Mahinda Nite' celebrations. Chandra Lal's loyalty to Mahinda College remains a guiding light to all those who uphold the traditions and values of the school.
Chandra Lal de Alwis unparalleled services to humanity rendered while honouring cultural and religious values, had been recognised both here and abroad. The Government of Japan once presented him with the The order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette medal.
Chandra Lal de Alwis took leave of life while setting an unswerving example of loyalty, and most of us who followed him will find him a difficult act to follow.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Argentina could not handle Springboks physicality - Ledesma
DURBAN, Saturday: Argentina coach Mario Ledesma called South Africa the most physical side in world rugby by far after his side lost their opening Rugby Championship match 34-21 in Durban on Saturday.
Newly-appointed Ledesma bemoaned his sides inability to handle the Springbok physicality as they were outscored six tries to three at Kings Park stadium.
I think obviously they had the momentum and they had much more quality ball than we had from set pieces, he admitted.
But it is difficult against a physical side like South Africa to keep stopping them and keep defending, and not having quality ball.
Even being in that position (where) we were 27-21 behind with 20 minutes to go... we could have won the game.
We would not have deserved to win the game, but we were in a position to win.
But we kept losing ball from lineouts and in the rucks and we knew they were targeting us on those two things.
Ledesma said the Springboks injected pace in the second half and that made the difference.
At the start of the second half, they started playing quick penalties, started kicking to touch and there was a purpose in everything they were doing.
They kept playing direct, physical footy and it is like a dam, and if you keep hammering, hammering, hammering, then all of a sudden the water bursts.
They are one of the best teams in the world, and they are the most physical team in the world by far, so we knew what was coming, we knew they were targeting us in the rucks.
They were world class on the ball, and we knew what was coming, but we could not handle what was coming at us.
Ledesma said his first match as national coach was difficult because of the result.
Obviously it was really special and it is difficult to measure what it means to me as a coach when you have just lost and you did not play very well.
But it was always a dream of mine when I started coaching. It is pretty special.
South Africa scored a bonus-point 34-21 Rugby Championship first round victory over Argentina with six tries compensating for woeful goal-kicking by Handre Pollard.
Wingers Aphiwe Dyantyi and Makazole Mapimpi bagged two each in Durban as the Springboks dominated the second half having trailed by nine points earlier.
Experienced fly-half Pollard missed five of seven shots at goal, which could have proven costly against stronger opposition than the Pumas.
New Argentina coach Mario Ledesma watched his team run out of gas after leading 14-10 at half-time as they suffered a 23rd loss in 29 Tests since the 2015 World Cup.
But the South Americans impressed sufficiently in patches to suggest they could be tougher opponents when the teams clash again next Saturday in Mendoza.
South Africa lie second on points difference behind title-holders New Zealand, who beat Australia 38-13 in Sydney earlier Saturday. - AFP

Art with grains
Lakmini Adikari, an Arts graduate of University of Kelaniya has a greater interest in creating art using beans and seeds of all colours, shapes and sizes.
Adikari a resident of Kallanchiya, Galgamuwa is currently working as a development officer at the Galgamuwa, Base Hospital. She creates crafts whenever she gets the time.
Adikari likes to make pictures of birds using the seeds. I love the idea of drawing the shape of a bird and then filling them with seeds, she said. Her parents said that even though they are living a life amidst great difficulties, their daughters talent and passion for art has kept them going without any regrets. They further expressed that she was so keen to make those pictures perfect so she would spend hours making one craft.
Since I was a kind I was so interested in making crafts by pasting together different things. It was in grade seven that I started to explore different seeds and the wonders they could do to my pictures, she said.
Adikari said that she first started with making crafts of her favorite birds and so far she has completed around 15 crafts.
I hardly get time to concentrate and do these crafts now. It is not very easy managing my time with my job. But whenever I get free time, I spent on making these crafts. So far I have made pictures of several kinds of birds as well, she said. She said that when a normal person sees it, he/ she might think that making this was not a big deal at all.
But it is not easy as everyone thinks. I was able to finish all the crafts very neat because of my patience. I am very keen even about the smaller features of the birds. It is very interesting to observe them. The seeds are also in different forms and shapes, therefore it is not easy to paste all of them according to the shape and unique features of the birds. Every bird has a unique feature and I always wanted to enhance it using different grains and seeds, she said.
Adikari make her crafts on a piece of cloth and she expressed that it was not easy to paste them neatly and added that she had to put a lot of effort to make it look perfect. She said that she draws the pictures of the bird on a cloth and then start pasting the seeds on it and added that she would first get the shape of the bird and the hardest parts are its neck, beak and wings.
One of the specialties in my craft is that I dont paint the seeds in different colours. I like the natural color of that and I like to keep it that way, she said.
She further said that she also finds all rare seeds to make them look more real and natural.
I dont color the seeds but would somehow find seeds in different colors to make the picture look more attractive and colorful. One cannot use all the rice seeds also. I usually use Samba, Naadu, sewadhel and heenetti grains to make crafts. , she added.
Adikari said that a lot of people in her village also help her find these rare grains.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 1.43% W-o-W (or LKR 41.05Bn) to LKR 2,834.86Bn cf. LKR 2,875.91Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 53.20% (or LKR 1.18Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH which accounted for 97.37% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 18.63% (or LKR 0.41Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Sampath Bank, Commercial Bank, Amana Bank and HNB which accounted for 62.19% of the sector turnover.

In terms of value, Anilana Hotels & Commercial Bank led foreign purchases while JKH & Amana Bank led foreign sales.
Point of view
Sri Lankan equities extended its losing streak since mid-July, with the benchmark index dropping 90 points or 1.5% W-o-W to end notably below the psychological 6100-mark (6051.1).
This weeks drop below the 6100-mark is the first time since early July that the Index has ranged at this levels and was largely prompted by bargain hunting on Sri Lankas key blue-chip JKH which dropped 4.8% this week relative to last week.
The Index remained below this level for 3-consecutive days to trade between a narrow 35 point range.
Whether or not 6100 remains the Indexs support level or whether 6000 will be the new support level for the Index will be tested next week since in the previous 2 instances this year when the Index fell below the 6100 mark it rebounded within a short span of 2-3 days.
This weeks 90-point loss dragged the YTD loss on the ASPI to 5.6% from 4.2% last week, and while the Index lost 4.4% in Q218, so far in Q318 it has already wiped off 2.3% of its value.
Activity levels in the market meanwhile remained mostly dull during the week and weekly turnover decreased 48.1% W-o-W to Rs.2.2Bn cf. Rs.4.3Bn.
Average daily turnover over the week consequently declined to Rs.0.44Bn from Rs.0.86 last week as local institutional and HNI investor involvement in the market remained dull and crossings for the week reduced to Rs.0.9Bn (cf. 2.3Bn last week) with JKH accounting for the bulk (45%) of the weeks total crossings.
Foreign investors meanwhile continued to sell-off Sri Lankan equities and net foreign outflows this week totaled to Rs.0.7Bn (cf.0.2Bn outflow last week) widening the YTD net foreign outflow from the Colombo Bourse to Rs.3.5Bn.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look for direction from the conclusion of the June-quarter earnings season.
Moodys maintains credit rating at B1 (Negative)
Credit ratings agency Moodys maintained Sri Lankas sovereign credit rating a B1 (Negative) adding that the countrys credit profile reflects the balance between progress in implementing reforms (fiscal consolidation and a build-up of FX), moderate per capita income levels and stronger institutions (than most similarly rated peers) against its vulnerability to tightening financial conditions.
The agency added that Sri Lankas credit challenges include high government debt levels, very low debt affordability and a fragile external payments position.
Moodys added that the negative outlook on the sovereigns credit profile signals that a rating upgrade is unlikely and is reflective of the Agencys view that Sri Lankas credit profile is dominated by the governments and countrys elevated exposure to refinancing risk, particularly in the context of significantly tighter external refinancing conditions during the next five years.
Moodys added that it would consider raising the outlook to back to stable if these external and domestic refinancing risks were to ease, adding that faster and more sustained non-debt-creating FX flows (eg: FDI) along with clear evidence of the effectiveness of the countrys liability management strategies and a marked improvement in fiscal strength could prompt a return to a stable outlook.
However, the Agency may consider downgrading Sri Lankas sovereign rating if i) external and domestic refinancing capacity dont improve, ii) there is a notable weakening in reserve adequacy (from the current low levels), or iii) there is a halt/reversal in the current fiscal consolidation process which raises the possibility of higher government debt and prevents a decline in gross borrowing requirements.

Awareness programme for UNPers,  SLFPers on future PC elections - PM
The government hopes to conduct Provincial Council elections shortly and an awareness has been created about it among relevant officials and leaders of political parties. As such, the UNP and SLFP supporters should have a proper understanding about their respective party operations and activities, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing a meeting after the distribution of land title deeds held at Kegalle town under the one million title deeds national programme on August 19.
The Prime Minister who emphasised the need for UNP and SLFP Ministers and Parliamentarians to continue such programmes of strengthening the people, said members of his government always honoured their word by deed without trying to blow their own trumpets.
Speaking in lighter vein, the Prime Minister said the country was a sick patient when the Government assumed power and most people urged them to go for a life saving measure to help the country. The patient had now gained consciousness and showing progress. The government gave the people a breath of freedom the moment it assumed power after forming a National Government and establishing a democratic framework in the country.
The Prime Minister said some doctors were now waging strikes to oppose the Sri Lanka Singapore - Free Trade Agreement. Going by this trend, another group of people may soon resort to strike action spurning Bollywood songs.
The Prime Minister who said that the Maharaja Concept (Emperor cult) is still visible in the country, added that democracy would not be of any use if that concept persisted.
He said the Hitler Concept mooted recently in some corner did not attract much criticism from the media. If by any chance anyone asked him to be a Hitler, he would have instantly criticised and denounced the idea. However, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had failed to denounce the proposal so far.

BCCI hands over Asia Cup hosting rights to the Emirates
DUBAI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has officially handed over the hosting rights of the upcoming edition of the biennale Asia Cup Cricket Tournament to the Emirates Cricket Board. The matches will be held in the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai.
The tournament was originally scheduled in India, and hence BCCI had the original hosting rights, given they administer the sport in the country. But that resulted in Pakistans participation becoming a problem, considering the prevailing political tensions between India and her neighbour.
As issues ensued, the BCCI was not able to obtain clearance from the Indian government to host the Pakistan cricket team. Hence, the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) shifted the tournament to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) but still continued to place India with the hosting rights. That has now ended, with it being passed on to the UAE Cricket Board.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the Emirates Cricket Board signed an agreement today for the United Arab Emirates to host the 2018 edition of the Asia Cup, the BCCI stated in a press release on Friday.
His Highness Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, the chairman of the Emirates Cricket Board, signed the agreement on behalf of the hosts, while Amitabh Chaudhary, the BCCI acting secretary, and CEO Rahul Johri represented the Indian cricket board.
It is a matter of great pride for the UAE to host a prestigious event like the Asia Cup. Our country is home to a large section of people from the participating nations and we feel privileged and excited by the opportunity to bring their favourite sport right here to their doorstep, said His Highness Sheikh Nahyan bin Mubarak Al Nahyan, before adding that the nation will provide support to the biggest cricketing event to be held in the UAE so far.
We are thankful to the Emirates Cricket Board for hosting the 2018 Asia Cup on behalf of the BCCI. We will see some of the sports powerhouse nations go head-to-head for ultimate glory and I am confident that cricket fans around the world will enjoy every moment of this prestigious event, Chaudhary said while having a chat with media representatives.
The 6-team tournament is slated to begin on September 15 and end on September 28, 2018.
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and one Asia Cup qualifier will play in the tournament.

Chelsea edge Arsenal in thriller, Kane scores in Spurs win
LONDON, Saturday: A second successive Chelsea win under Maurizio Sarri, 3-2 over an Arsenal side who have suffered back-to-back defeats under Unai Emery, gave both managers a crash course in the unpredictability of the Premier League on Saturday.
Marcos Alonso pounced on Eden Hazards cross to settle the game in the second half after the visitors fought back from two down but spurned further chances in a game that lifted Chelsea joint top of the table alongside Tottenham Hotspur, who beat Fulham 3-1, and Bournemouth, who won 2-1 at West Ham United.
Elsewhere, Leicester City and Everton posted their first victories, against Wolves and Southampton respectively, while the days other game between league newcomers Cardiff City and Newcastle United ended goalless.
That sort of scoreline was never a possibility at Stamford Bridge, where the visitors raced into the lead through Alvaro Morata and Pedro, but were lucky to go into the interval level after Arsenal squandered opportunities either side of goals from Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Alex Iwobi.
Chelsea brought Hazard off the bench midway through the second half and were rewarded when he broke free on the left and crossed for Alonso to shoot low under Petr Cechs body.
It is better to be on the pitch than watching on the bench, but the boys when they are playing they did well so I am just happy for the win, Hazard said.
In the week that Spurs apologised to their supporters for further delay in their return to White Hart Lane, their victory gave a reminder of how accustomed they have grown to Wembley, with two of their England internationals leading the way after Fulham equalised Lucas Mouras opener.
IMPRESSIVE WIN
Kieran Trippier replicated his free-kick goal for England in the World Cup with another superb strike before Harry Kane rounded off an impressive win by scoring his first ever Premier League goal in August.
It is one of those things that you cant explain, Kane said of his previous slow starts to seasons. I am not silly and I know people talk about it, but it is nice to put it to bed.
Bournemouth took full advantage of comic home defending to strike twice in six second-half minutes through Callum Wilson and Steve Cook, inflicting Manuel Pellegrinis second successive defeat since returning to the Premier League with West Ham.
Everton also changed managers in the summer but Marco Silva has enjoyed a more promising beginning and secured a 2-1 win in his first home game with new signing Richarlison scoring his third goal in two games since his move from Watford.
The Brazilian only managed five in total last season but looks a different proposition since reuniting with his former manager.
Richarlison headed Evertons second after former Southampton forward Theo Walcott had opened the scoring after a well-worked free-kick move from Leighton Baines and Morgan Schneiderlin.
Another Brazilian, Newcastle Uniteds Kenedy, had a less memorable day, missing a stoppage-time penalty which would have given the 10-man visitors victory at Cardiff City, who were playing their first home Premier League game for four years.
Cardiffs hero was keeper Neil Etheridge, who saved his second spot-kick in successive games to spark wild celebrations at the Cardiff City stadium.
Leicester also ended their 2-0 win over Wolves with 10 men after their England striker Jamie Vardy was dismissed for a reckless tackle on Matt Doherty.
The challenge that was all the more needless because Leicester were in control through a Doherty own goal and a strike from James Maddison, his first Premier League goal since his 24 million-pound ($30.6 million) move from second-tier Norwich City.

Chief Minister commends journalists role during civil war
During the countrys civil war, journalists provided accurate information, while risking their lives. Their commitment helped keep the nation and the world informed on the true situation of the conflict, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
He was addressing a media briefing at the Southern Province Media Centre (SPMC) in Galle, on Friday.
Galle Mayor Priyantha Sahabandu, Southern Provincial Councillor Sanjiv Karunathilake, Deputy Galle Mayor Fauzal Niyas and Attorney-at-Law Thusara De Silva were present.
The Chief Ministers birthday was also celebrated during a brief function prior to the briefing.
I commend the services of journalists, while attempting to maintain a cordial relationship with them, he said.
We sometimes witness rifts and misunderstandings between politicians as well as the media, which unfavourable for the countrys progress. I believe that the relationship between politicians and the media should always be healthy, the chief minister added.
I have been active in politics for nearly three decades. When I was first appointed as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party Chief Organiser (SLFP) for the Ambalangoda electorate, I pledged before late Party Leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike that I would uphold carry out my duties without fail, he said.
Certain decisions would be unfavorable for political progress and as such, we should follow a just path, and not what is popular, Chief Minister de Silva added.

First it was Monsanto, and now...
Given the jurisdiction on compensation payment for the victim of cancer alleged through Glyphosate spray, and the imminent withdrawal of Glyphosate from Supermarkets, isn't it about time that the Sri Lankan Parliament debated the recent directive of re-introducing Glyphosate as a systemic herbicide to be used extensively within the island
If person/s in Sri Lanka believe that they are victims of cancers, neuromuscular disorders etc., due to the use of Glyphosate over last few decades and seek compensation through jurisdiction of the Courts, will the US judgement be presented as Case Law
If the litigants are to be compensated following Court directives, who will pay the costs - the taxpayer or the Corporate sales agencies in Sri Lanka or those who played the Pied Pipers for the Glyphosate manufacturers such as Monsanto
When will our national leaders have the backbone to address, without fear or favour, this issue concerning the very healthcare of our people, in the light of these recent global outcomes

Colombo Port City catalyst for future development-RIU
The Colombo Port City will function as a catalyst for future development and investment and the development process its self, says Research Intelligence Report (RIU) published in Sri Lanka. This may last for up to another 25 years the newly released report said.
Port City will serve to increase demand for residential, commercial and hotel real estate within the prime Colombo area.
The Port City Project will also create more than 83,000 jobs. If we consider that 10% of these will be at the senior management and consultant levels, then we are looking at new demand from around 8,300 professionals who will be working on this project, the 2018 RIU report adds.
On the commercial office space the RIU report says growth in the service sector segments like wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport and communication and banking, insurance and real estate will continue to drive demand for office space whether it is Grade A or B.
Roshan Madawela
As the middle class grows and income rises, domestic consumption will increase with time and the demand for more international brands will grow, in the retail market space the report says. Retail sales are forecasted to grow to US$ 51 Bn by 2022up 70 percent from 2017 and per capita income will rise sharply to US$ 7,500 by 2020 from US$ 4,000 in 2016 according to most agencies. According to RIUs market intelligence, this sector has many shortcomings which in turn can be made into opportunities by the developers. In the current context Sri Lanka is still driven by the traditional shopping experience, in fact the local consumer has not really experienced the real International shopping mall experience, the report adds.
 It is clear that Sri Lanka has enjoyed a sustained growth in the supply of high-end luxury apartments. In 2009, the semi-luxury and luxury housing stock stood at just 783 units with the number increasing beyond 4,000 units by 2016 and when calculated the number of developments that have been approved or are currently under construction, then the number of units will top 14,000 by 2020,
An upward incline in the market is always good news but also carries with it the demand of hard work, greater requirements on knowledge and data as well as rising competition, Roshan Madawela, Founder and Chief Executive of RIU said.
Following a good year for the Sri Lankan real estate industry last year, 2018 promises to be another exiting year that has already witnessed the enactment of several government initiatives that we expect will serve to build international investor confidence,
The market will certainly benefit from the foreign and expat community who are likely to play a more significant role in the coming years ahead with the Cabinet approving new visa regulation changes for visitors and expats early this year. Already, the number of dual-citizenship that have been given to the diaspora community has increased significantly according to our sources, the report said.

Coral Properties invests Rs 9 bn in Sri Lanka and Maldives
Coral Properties Colombo 4 is investing nearly Rs. 9 billion for several ongoing construction projects both in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Coral Property Developers Chairman, Dr. Praba Subramanian told Daily News Business that they are investing Rs. 1.2 billion for this mixed development project currently being construed in Gampaha. This includes a 15 storied 66 apartments and a 5 storied shopping and office complex. Its the only luxury apartment cum office development project in the District. Branded as Coral City its also the only twin tower development project in the district. 
He said that the project would be handed over to the owners by mid 2019.
Coral City in Gampaha
The Coral Properties biggest development of Coral Plus is now been constructed at Marine Drive Colombo which is a 20 floor, 60 unit apartment project. The total investment for this project is Rs. 1.6 billion and would be completed in 2019 December.
He said that two of their projects Coral X and Coral Lake Minerva in Rajagiriya both offing 24 luxury units each are now in the piling stage and would be ready by end of 2019. He said that the total cost for this project is Rs. 2 billion.
We have also invested Rs.1 billion in Coral Saffron in Mount Lavinia which is a 15 storied project offering 77 apartments to be completed by 2019.
Established in 2003, Coral Properties have already completed 8 niche property ventures that include, 5 storied, Coral Towers, Coral Court, Coral Residencies, (both 6 floors) Coral Castle (8 floors) and Corals Kings Court, Coral Villa in Wellawatte and Coral Waves in Dehiwela. Their last project of 72 units Coral Mansion was sold out.
We are looking at more projects in Dehiwela and Mattakkuliya and we see more demand in those areas. Our aim is to have 1,000 keys by 2020, he said.
Dr. Praba said that though there is a slight drop in demand for up market luxury condominiums there is an increase requirement for mix-market housing unit due to the migration to Colombo. Due to the governments scheme to allow foreigners to buy properties in Sri Lanka we also see a demand especially from Chinese for the apartment sector. This will increase with the commencement of the Port City Project in Colombo.
Commenting on their Maldives projects, he said that they are also involved in a Rs. 14 billion mixed development project in Hulhumale in the Maldives. It has been branded as Y Coral Luxury Apartment and Mall and is the biggest construction project ever to be awarded to a Sri Lankan company.
The project is to develop Y Coral as three separate podiums with in towers in each podium with a maximum height of 12 floors and Arcade frontage in each. Each tower is paired as 12 and 10 floor levels giving a sky scraper level look to Hulhumale.

Credence Genomics launches IVF GScan
Credence Genomics Pvt Ltd Sri Lankas first and only Next Generation Sequencing facility launches IVF GScan  Pre implantation genetic screening for In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). The cutting edge screening technology assists in IVF testing increasing success of conception.
Infertility is a serious medical problem all over the world usually caused due to various reasons including smoking, late marriages, menstrual irregularities and chronic illnesses etc. Due to the late onset of pregnancies the success of IVF has been limited till now as the ability to choose the most successful embryos for inception has not been possible till IVF GScan. IVF GScanincreases the success rate of IVF by 20  30 per cent as the most successful embryos are selected.
Studies globally show next generation sequencing technology used for pre-implantation screening have a near 100 per cent accuracy in identifying suitability of embryo for implantation. Obstetricians and gynecologists who integrate IVF GScan in their IVF treatment protocol have established higher rates of success.
Credence Genomics conducted an observational study on embryos obtained from local IVF centers in Sri Lanka. Following integration of IVF GScan in the IVF process and increase of over 52 per cent in successful pregnancies was noted. Furthermore an indirect benefit is a reduction in the number of cycles for the patient and the treating physicians.
Credence Genomics Lab Manager, L M Abayasekera presented the final outcome of IVF using IVF GScan in Sri Lanka at the 51st Annual Scientific Congress of Sri Lanka College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists held recently at Sri Lanka Foundation. Our study data shows a clear increase in the rate of successful IVF implantations by conducting pre-implantation genetic screening using IVF G-scan, she said.
Fertility and Genetic Expert and Senior Lecturer of Ragama Medical Faculty Dr. Padmapani Padeniya said, IVF GScan is the new frontier of testing aneuploidy in IVF technology. In fact this test provides the selective screening of embryos before being implanted hence the success rate can be enhanced. Further it will directly reduce the incidence of birth defects in Sri Lanka.
Credence Chairman/CEO, Dr. Vaz Gnanam, said, As we continue to pioneer and develop the latest accurate, tests for the region our commitment to providing the best in health care is represented in our infertility range of GScan products. As a company we believe that this product range will add value to IVF and the general practice of obstetrics and gynecology.

Day of the humanitarian heroes
Yesterday was World Humanitarian Day (WHD). The celebration is held every year on August 19 to pay tribute to aid workers who risk their lives in humanitarian service and to rally support for people affected by crises around the world.
WHD continues to focus attention on the millions of civilians affected by armed conflict every day. People in cities and towns struggle to find food, water and safe shelter, while fighting drives millions from their homes. Children are recruited and used to fight, and their schools are destroyed.
Women are abused and humiliated. As humanitarian workers deliver aid, and medical workers treat the wounded and sick, they are directly targeted, viewed as threats, and prevented from bringing relief and care to those in desperate need.
World Humanitarian Day is a time to recognise those who face danger and adversity in order to help others. The Day was designated by the United Nations General Assembly in 2008 to coincide with the date of the 2003 bombing of the United Nations headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq.
The bomb attack on the Canal Hotel in Baghdad killed 22 humanitarian aid workers, including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello. Sergio was born in Brazil, and worked tirelessly over three decades to help those victims of armed conflict by easing their pain and making sure the world did not forget them. These people struggle every day to survive against odds that were created in spite of their desire to just live in peace and safety. Around the world, humanitarian aid workers operate in dangerous and difficult environments. Over the past 20 years, 4,132 aid workers have been attacked. Last year alone more than 97 aid workers were killed, 88 were injured and 73 were kidnapped in the line of duty. The majority of these attacks took place in five countries: South Sudan, Afghanistan, Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Somalia.
Attacks against aid workers are deplorable and represent clear violations of international humanitarian law. In addition to endangering aid workers, these attacks threaten humanitarian operations and the lives of millions of people who rely on humanitarian assistance for their survival.
Every year thousands of men and women the world over put their lives in danger working in humanitarian causes all over the world. Working in the most poverty and illness stricken third world countries the world over, often in areas of great social violence, these dedicated heroes put their lives on the line, and sometimes lose them in the pursuit of their goals. World Humanitarian Day is when we remember these heroes and their sacrifices.
Every day humanitarian aid workers help millions of people around the world, regardless of who they are and where they are. In essence, the day is a global celebration of people helping people. These are victims trapped in wars that arent of their own making. Meanwhile, the world isnt doing enough to stop their suffering. The UN demands that world leaders do everything in their power to protect the millions of civilians caught in armed conflict.
It is estimated that more than 130 million people worldwide require humanitarian assistance in order to survive. Yet, we have to recognise that the world is at a critical juncture, as we are witnessing human suffering unparalleled since the Second World War. More than 60 million people, mostly children, have been forced from their homes due to conflicts and violence. The human and economic cost of disasters caused by natural hazards is also on the rise. Over the past two decades, 218 million people were affected each year by disasters at an annual cost to the global economy that now exceeds US$300 billion. That is why we must continually seek better ways to meet the needs of millions of people affected by conflicts and disasters in our rapidly changing world.
Every day, humanitarian aid workers stand on the front lines of war and disaster to provide life-saving assistance to millions of people worldwide. These people brave tremendous dangers and difficulties to deliver assistance to those who need it most and it is fitting that we applaud their absolute selflessness on this special day.
To honour them, a number of events will take place around the world. For instance, a wreath-laying ceremony will take place at the United Nations headquarters in New York, along with a high- profile event that will be held in the General Assembly Hall. A digital campaign will be launched to raise awareness of the impossible choices faced by people caught in crisis. Photography exhibitions and film screenings will complement these activities by documenting and portraying the lives of those affected by conflict and disaster. The UN Secretary-General held the first-ever global humanitarian summit of this scale in Istanbul in May 2016. The goal of this summit was to find new ways to tackle humanitarian needs in our fast-changing world. This three-year initiative is being managed by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). The summit set a new agenda for global humanitarian action. It focuses on humanitarian effectiveness, reducing vulnerability and managing risk, transformation through innovation, and serving the needs of people in conflict.
The Day also seeks to draw attention to humanitarian needs worldwide and the importance of international co-operation in meeting these needs. Every year, disasters cause immense suffering for millions of people  usually the world's poorest, most marginalized and vulnerable individuals. Humanitarian aid workers strive to provide life-saving assistance and long term rehabilitation to disaster-affected communities, regardless of where they are in the world and without discrimination based on nationality, social group, religion, sex, race or any other factor.
Humanitarian aid is based on a number of founding principles, including humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. Humanitarian aid workers should be respected, and be able to access those in need in order to provide vital assistance. Humanitarian aid workers can be international, but most come from the country in which they work. They reflect all cultures, ideologies and backgrounds and they are united by their commitment to humanitarianism.
Everyone can be a humanitarian. People affected by disasters are often the first to help their own communities following a disaster. Responding to emergencies is only one aspect of humanitarian work. Humanitarian workers also support communities to rebuild their lives after disasters, to become more resilient to future crises, to advocate for their voices to be heard, and to build lasting and sustainable peace in areas of conflict.

Democracy and optimism as a mighty form of resistance
Progress is never permanent, will always be threatened, must be redoubled, restated and reimagined if it is to survive, Zadie Smith wrote in her spectacular essay on optimism and despair. The illusion of permanent progress inflicts a particularly damning strain of despair as we witness the disillusioning undoing of triumphs of democracy and justice generations in the making  despair preventable only by taking a wider view of history in order to remember that democracy advances in fits and starts, in leaps and backward steps, but advances nonetheless, on timelines exceeding any individual lifetime.
Amid our current atmosphere of presentism bias and extreme narrowing of perspective, it is not merely difficult but downright countercultural to resist the ahistorical panic by taking such a telescopic view  lucid optimism that may be our most unassailable form of resistance to the corruptions and malfunctions of democracy.
Splendid fragments
That is what Walt Whitman (May 31, 1819March 26, 1892) insisted on again and again in Specimen Days (public library)  the splendid collection of his prose fragments, letters, and diary entries that gave us his wisdom on the wisdom of trees, the singular power of music, how art enhances life, and what makes life worth living.
Shortly before his sixtieth birthday and a decade after issuing his immensely prescient admonition that America, if eligible at all to downfall and ruin, is eligible within herself, not without, Whitman writs under the heading DEMOCRACY IN THE NEW WORLD:
I can conceive of no better service in the United States, henceforth, by democrats of thorough and heart-felt faith, than boldly exposing the weakness, liabilities and infinite corruptions of democracy.
Having lived and saved lives through the Civil War, having seen the swell of vast crops of poor, desperate, dissatisfied, nomadic, miserably-waged populations, having witnessed the corrosion of idealism and the collapse of democratic values into corruption and complacency, Whitman still faces a dispiriting landscape with a defiant and irrepressible optimism  our mightiest and most countercultural act of courage, then and now and always:
Though I think I fully comprehend the absence of moral tone in our current politics and business, and the almost entire futility of absolute and simple honor as a counterpoise against the enormous greed for worldly wealth, with the trickeries of gaining it, all through society in our day, I still do not share the depression and despair on the subject which I find possessing many good people.
Telescopic perspective
Zooming out of the narrow focus of his cultural moment  as we would be well advised to do with ours  Whitman takes a telescopic perspective of time, progress, and social change, and considers what it really takes to win the future:
The advent of America, the history of the past century, has been the first general aperture and opening-up to the average human commonalty, on the broadest scale, of the eligibilities to wealth and worldly success and eminence, and has been fully taken advantage of; and the example has spread hence, in ripples, to all nations. To these eligibilities  to this limitless aperture, the race has tended, en-masse, roaring and rushing and crude, and fiercely, turbidly hastening  and we have seen the first stages, and are now in the midst of the result of it all, so far. But there will certainly ensue other stages, and entirely different ones. In nothing is there more evolution than the American mind. Soon, it will be fully realized that ostensible wealth and money-making, show, luxury, &c., imperatively necessitate something beyond  namely, the sane, eternal moral and spiritual-esthetic attributes, elements Soon, it will be understood clearly, that the State cannot flourish, (nay, cannot exist,) without those elements. They will gradually enter into the chyle of sociology and literature. They will finally make the blood and brawn of the best American individualities of both sexes. Three years later, and ten presidencies before a ruthless government began assaulting and exploiting nature as a resource for commercial and political gain, Whitman revisits the subject under the heading NATURE AND DEMOCRACYMORTALITY:
American Democracy, in its myriad personalities, in factories, work-shops, stores, offices  through the dense streets and houses of cities, and all their manifold sophisticated life  must either be fibred, vitalized, by regular contact with out-door light and air and growths, farm-scenes, animals, fields, trees, birds, sun-warmth and free skies, or it will morbidly dwindle and pale. We cannot have grand races of mechanics, work people, and commonalty, (the only specific purpose of America,) on any less terms. I conceive of no flourishing and heroic elements of Democracy in the United States, or of Democracy maintaining itself at all, without the Nature-element forming a main part  to be its health-element and beauty-element  to really underlie the whole politics, sanity, religion and art of the New World.

Designing the Earth and Sky Connection
Samira Rathod has been visiting Sri Lanka on and off for 30 years, but when the Indian architect recently returned to Colombo for a project, she was struck by how the city has remained green in the wake of rapid development.
Now at the helm of a high rise in Rajagiriya, Rathod is a player in the construction of a 21st century Colombo and challenging herself to maintain the lush landscape that defines the city.
By building an unlikely harmony between the verdant earth and towering structures, Rathod brings us back to our roots, making the oft sterile and isolating modern space warm and social.
Reclaiming Slowness
When a business partner introduced Rathod at press conference as fiercely independent and extremely opinionated, she quipped, I shall take that as a compliment.
Rathod is quick and snappy with her opinions but slow and measured with her aesthetic judgments.
One minute, she is voicing her views on gender-specific awardsbeing a woman is not a handicap, she assertsor expressing her disdain for the certificate-centric state of educationto really be an architect, Rathod told me, it takes 60 years of study, not a degree. First, you must master everything from literature to mathematics.
The next minute, her tone changes, waxing philosophical about imbuing buildings with poetry. Evincing a lifetime spent wrestling with aesthetic questions she articulates her thoughts on design with coherency and ease.
The Bombay-based designer blends cosmopolitan energy with bucolic contemplation. She laments the way the grind of modern life has snatched up our time. Just to be able to savor a cup of tea, watching the rain sprinkle and spray while sitting on the veranda, those moments are lost, she says, explaining that in her practice and product, she is trying to return to slowness.
Whether its a skyscraper, a building, housing or a school I think its these moments that, as an architect, I want to bring it back.
Rathod is methodical and painstaking in her approach. She values the process. Theres no end that one is looking for, its the churning that one is enjoying. I am deeply interested in getting into details. she says. I really worry about the doorknob, she adds, only half joking.
Reshaping Tradition
Rathod earned her Bachelors of Architecture in bustling Bombay and her masters at the University of Illinois Urbana Champagne, USA. After a brief stint working in California, during which she assisted on a project for Clint Eastwood, the budding architect headed back to her hometown and founded Samira Rathod Design Atelier (SRDA) in 2000. Eighteen years later, her once small firm has grown into an internationally recognized brand, complete with an interior design counterpart and a research division called Spade.
Rathods repertoire ranges from imaginative schoolhouses to dizzying skyscrapers to cutting-edge office spaces.
A school comprised of dancing arches in Gujarat, where hide and seek is perpetual; an exhibition in Jaipur meditating on negative space; a shadow house in Bombay built strategically to offer respite from the heat, Rathods ideas and structures are scattered across the subcontinent.
To Sri Lanka, she is bringing Iconic Galaxy, a high-end, modern living space with a nod to the past.
Rathod is internationally-minded, but each of her designs is locally-inspired. With a knack for getting what she calls the pulse and texture of a place, Rathod places context at the center of her design. In preparation for Iconic Galaxy in Sri Lanka, she traveled the island observing and striving to understand the culture and aspirations of the people.
She says she studies context incrementallyfirst, Sri Lanka, then Colombo, then Rajagiriya. On her most recent visit to Sri Lanka, she hoped to learn what materials and colours Sri Lankans find comfortable.
In responding to context, Rathod strives to imbibe her work with the virtues and sensibilities of traditional craft, but is careful not to be kitschy. One doesnt want to get ethnic to the extent that it begins to feel as if its being emulated directly she explains, that, to my mind, is fairly senseless and very superficial and pastiche.
It has to come from within, she says.
Reviving Community
While Rathod drops academic names like Le Corbusier, a Swiss architect known for his radical, compact housing, she also cites her childhood, growing up in a chawl in India, as inspiration for her design philosophy.
She recalls an upbringing spent playing in a courtyard wedged between four tall residential buildings, a space shared with families and friends. You never had to worry about who to call for help, she said and remembered walking down the shared corridor, populated by grandparents chattering in the veranda.
The chawls of India are notorious for their lack of privacy, and the way in which close living allows gossip to spread rapidly. Everyone knows everything about everybodys lives, she remembers.
For Rathod, this alternative kind of privacy was a small price to pay for the benefits of communal living. Privacy is in the mind. Im private because Im thinking, you can watch me... it goes like that, she says.
It was such a joy, and I feel todays children are so glued to the computer, iPad and TV that these joys are something that they are not able to savour. I dont even know how to explain it to them. We had so much fun, she remembers.
She wont have to explain it if she can recreate a piece of it. In Iconic Galaxy, Rathods most recent project in Sri Lanka, she wants to harness the communal nature of human beings and consequently, pull us away from our devices.
But its no easy task.
A high rise, like Iconic Galaxy, is a building that, by default, isolates everybody from the ground, as Rathod explains. When youre on the ground, theres a connect with the city, when youre up in the air, theres a disconnect from the city.
And thus, to fight the isolation inherent to the shuttered living compartments and stacks of indiscriminate floors, community has to be created within the building.
Rathod believes shared spaces build communities and designed five levels of communal spacesgyms, lounges, an observatory, and a childrens playground and placed them the very top of the structure.
The building functions less like an apartment complex and more like an entire neighbourhoodcomplete with a supermarket and collapsed into a single building.
When you start sharing, you understand each others problems, youre less intolerant
Rathod reasons. If I have to share something, if I have to use the same pathway, I have to share the swing, I have respect for the other because I expect respect from the other.
Reconnecting with Nature
In the same way the Shadow House was built for cooling and the schoolhouse was built for imaginative exploration, the iconic galaxy will also be built to pull the best from its environmentbut this time, to highlight green area around it.
Colombos parks and tree lined streets mediate the chaos of that urban environment. And for Rathod, keeping that intact in the midst of fast development was crucial.
Colombo is one of very few cities in the world which is still so green, and I really hope it will stay that way, she says.
It seems contradictory to make a structure built for the sky inspired by the world below, but it is in the unity of the air and the earth, the high and the low, the elevated and the grounded that the gap between the world and the apartment living space is mended.
In Rathods latest, the rooftop will be full of gardens. A topiary maze will provide space for winding strolls and a childrens garden will give space for play. Even at the highest point of this metal structure, the earth will not seem as far away.
But its not just about indulging in nature, preserving nature is equally, arguably more, important to Rathod. We investigate ideas of sustainability, not necessarily in the way that gets you a certificate, but, more importantly, in how you can change the way people think about sustainability, she says.
Even when talking about sustainability, Rathod invokes the same philosophy she uses in her life, if we can make things beautiful so that we love them, we will not discard them easily she says. Sustainability really means just slow. Just slow down and do things with care.

England 161 all out against India in 3rd Test
Nottingham, Sunday: England collapsed to 161 in reply to Indias first-innings 329, a deficit of 168 runs, at tea on the second day of the third Test at Trent Bridge on Sunday.
Hardik Pandya took a Test-best five for 28, his maiden five-wicket haul at this level, while debutant wicket-keeper Rishabh Pant held five catches as England lost all 10 of their wickets in a session of play.
At 129 for nine, England were still two runs shy of avoiding the follow-on, but Jos Buttlers fortunate leading edge off Mohammed Shami just over the head of Ajinkya Rahane at cover meant India would have to bat again.
Buttler top-scored with 39 before he was last man out, his dismissal leading to tea. England lead this five-match series 2-0.

The total investment for the Gamperaliya programme is unparalleled when it comes to financial allocations for short-term rapid rural development projects in the country, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was speaking at the inauguration ceremony of the renovation of an irrigation canal in Madiha, Matara.
The Minister said the government through Gamperaliya will take immediate measures to accelerate economic growth by improving the infrastructure facilities and to develop the livelihood of the rural people.
The Minister said Gamperaliya brings fruits of development directly to the village in a short time.
All electoral divisions will receive equal benefits under the programme. Each Divisional Secretariat has been provided with Rs.200 million for development work in 2018 alone. Through the budget we will allocate more funds for village development, he told people.
I am not a minister fond of laying foundation stones. I heard that several foundation stones had been laid to renovate this canal, but nothing happened. That is how the past rulers misled the people in the name of development.
They spent millions to build massive roads in Hambantota where only two or three vehicles ply in an hour. They did not care about village development, he added.
The Minister said the Gamperaliya programme will improve the living standards of the villagers and bring more money to the village.
He said the Gamperaliya will fast-track rural development of irrigation, rural roads, schools, sanitary facilities and playgrounds, Sathipola, green park, electricity, renovation of religious and archaeological sites, housing development, issuing land deeds and entrepreneurship in all districts.

The Minister made this announcement addressing the council meeting of the Non Communicable Disease Unit at the Health Ministry.
The Minister said 95 percent of cancer drugs are purchased by the government and the private sector sells about 5 percent.
He said cancer drugs are very expensive and many patients do not have the money to purchase the drugs.
The Minister said the government spends over Rs. 7 billion annually to import cancer drugs.
He pointed out that the price of one cancer drug which was Rs.280,000 when the Yahapalana Government came to power has now been reduced to Rs.144,000.
Similarly, the prices of 10 cancer drugs will be reduced, he added.
Until the Yahapalana Government came to power, the Health Ministry paid money to pharmaceutical companies. I removed the Rs.1.5 million upper limit for cancer treatment. Now one patient has received treatment worth Rs.45 million plus. Due to these efforts, the life span of cancer patients have increased, he said.

## Title: THE GLYPHOSATE SAGA
## Supertitle: Throw the baby away with the bathwater
## Section: Features

Throw the baby away with the bathwater
THE GLYPHOSATE SAGA
Local social media has been giving huge publicity to a recent San Francisco Federal court judgement in favour of a plaint filed by a groundskeeper, Dewayne Johnson in California claiming that his illness, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a cancer, was caused by glyphosate. He had been regularly applying the weed killer, in school playgrounds. A government toxicologist, Dr Charles W. Jameson was a key witness for the prosecution. He gave evidence supporting Johnson and his testimony was that To a reasonable degree of scientific certainly, glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides are likely to cause cancer in humans, particularly at real-world exposures including the levels farm workers and others face when using the weed killer.
Interestingly, this toxicologist was a member of the team that declared in their report to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2015 that glyphosate is probably cancer causing leading to placement of this chemical in Class 2 A of the carcinogenicity classification. However, there are apparently some 300 other studies that are contrary to the IARC finding, and refuting the contention that glyphosate is cancer causing. Chief among these are two studies, the Joint WHO and FAO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) which categorically states that there is no evidence that glyphosate is either carcinogenic or genotoxic. Even more comprehensive is the American Health Study with some 90, 000 farmers using glyphosate over a period exceeding 25 years and published in November, 2017. It too concludes that there is no evidence that glyphosate is carcinogenic. In this background, therefore, the San Francisco Court judgement is difficult to comprehend.
Contradictory judgements
The San Francisco Chronicle August 13 argues that despite this verdict courts will differ on Monsantos herbicide in regard to the numerous plaints filed against the company claiming damages by the herbicide applicators. Despite a judgement by a California court early this year, that Glyphosate products should carry a warning label consistent with the IARC pronouncement that it is probably cancer causing, it would appear that the verdict had been annulled. Subsequently, a federal judge in Sacramento has prohibited California State from requiring such a label. He had concluded that a heavy weight of evidence showed that the herbicide glyphosate was safe. In his judgement he had cited the report of the US Environmental Protection Agency and that of other regulatory bodies in Europe that the herbicide, glyphosate, was safe! Contradictory judgements therefore imply that there is no final proof that the herbicide is cancer causing or probably cancer causing as determined by IARC.
Moreover, causation in epidemiology is a highly complex subject, and mere association does not necessarily imply causation. In other words, Dewayne Johnsons association with glyphosate does not necessarily mean that the latter caused him NHL. In epidemiology, there are eight universally accepted criteria known as the Bradford-Hill criteria at least several of which should be satisfied for establishing causation, only one of them being the strength of the association. It would appear that the jurys decision was substantially conditioned by the terminal illness of Johnson with his body, virtually totally covered in lesions and welts! Probably an element of sympathy influenced the decision. Further, the question should be asked whether a jury of ordinary layman without expert knowledge in the subject could make a decision on a matter of this nature. We, however, have no information on the competence of the jurors on the subject. Monsanto is expected to appeal against the judgement. Let us wait for the outcome.
Meanwhile this news has caused, as to be expected, much euphoria among the anti-glyphosate lobbyists both here and overseas. One of our chief lobbyists is a Buddhist monk, who has no notion of science or agriculture, but has been vehemently opposing conventional agriculture, agrochemical use and actively promoting organic farming in the course of which he has promoted a fertilizer concoction, Pivithuru Pohora of which he is also the chief architect. This fertilizer has failed to show any response in the Agriculture Departments trials, but has been vigorously promoted among Mahaweli System B farmers, some of who have been paid compensation by the Mahaweli Authority for loss of crop consequent on its use! On enquiry, one farmer told the writer that he was paid Rs 12,500 as compensation last season .The other is a pharmacologist who has been shouting hoax that glyphosate is responsible for the kidney disease, CKDu, and even had come up with a hypothesis that glyphosate complexing with metallic elements in the hard water in the NCP is probably the cause of the disease.
This hypothesis has not been supported by any other researcher and has been severely criticized by several reputed chemists in the country that it is utterly faulty! He, together with the monk, has also been insisting that the government should not lift the ban on the weed killer.
He even clamoured over the TV following the San Francisco judgement, that he too is filing litigation against Monsanto for glyphosate causing CKDu! The writer has gone this far on these highly biased personalities to give an indication of the magnitude of damage that they cause to poor farmers and the misinformation spread in the public mind. The ban on the herbicide was, however, lifted recently at least for two crops tea and rubber thanks to the valiant efforts of the Minister of Plantation industries. Ideally it should have been lifted for all crops because it was banned on the false premise that it caused the kidney disease.
Many main stream scientists and the Pesticide Technical Advisory Committee have requested the government to do so. Despite the ban illegal glyphosate is being used across the country virtually on every crop at great cost to the farmer as it is exorbitantly expensive. The farmers using it at any cost are indicative of their dependency on it to control weeds. The government should do well to lift the ban for all crops. There is now convincing evidence that CKDu is associated with the source of potable water and not any agrochemical.
Adequate precautions
In conclusion, glyphosate is the most widely used pesticide both globally and locally. The quantity used is more than that of the cumulative total of all other pesticides! In comparison to most other pesticides its toxicity is relatively low, its acute reference dose (ARfD) is as high as 0.5 mg/kg of body weight, and the acceptable operator level (AOEL) is set at 0.1 mg /kg body weight per day. Despite such low toxicity indicators, given, the emerging evidence of possible risks, the government should have wide farmer and public training on its safe use.
Our farmers often spray pesticides bare bodied for want of strict advice and rules. It would appear that Johnson, the California groundskeeper has been very frequently spraying the weed killer. By contrast in arable crops here it is usually applied once per season prior to planting. In tea, however, the regular applicators apply more frequently, and their exposure probably higher. On the other hand vegetable farmers apply insecticides of much higher toxicity such as carbosulphan, propanophos and diazinon many times per season which could be more risky than glyphosate. Further, given our magnitude of exposure to other toxins such as vehicle exhaust fumes and emissions from the coal power plants many of which are Class 1 carcinogens, the risk of glyphosate should be negligible providing adequate precautions are taken. The Johnson fiasco should be an eye opener to the authorities for vigilant training of farmers in pesticide use as also for enacting rigid rules and regulations.
Given the vital need of glyphosate in weed management in farming and the fact that no other country has banned it despite emerging concerns, we hope the government will not rush again into throwing the baby away with the bath water The health authorities should, as a precautionary measure, undertake a study on the status of glyphosate residues in farmers who spray it regularly, especially of the tea estate applicators.

Govt to increase share of mining in GDP
The government plans to increase the share of mining in GDP. Lankan graphite producers are likely to see even better times in future, said Minister of Industry and Commerce , Risath Bathiudeen, addressing an evening session themed Intelligence in Graphite organised by Bogala Graphite Lanka PLC, a subsidiary of GraphitKropfmuhl GmbH (part of AMG N.V.), which has mining operations in Africa and Asia recently.
The Ministry of Industry and Commerce too contributes to the mining GDP of Sri Lanka. For example, Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Limited (KGLL) under my Ministry is a fully government owned company. It has Sri Lankas leading underground mine, producing high quality graphite with above 99% carbon purity said Minister Bathiudeen.
From 2006 to 2017 the total production of graphite by KGLL is more than 8,000 metric tonnes and it exported 6,300 MT. For 2018 KGLL has a Production Target of 840 MT. Graphene which is worlds new breakthrough material is produced from graphite.
I believe that Lankan graphite producers such as Bogala Graphite and Kahatagaha Graphite therefore are likely to see even better times in future.
Global investors also welcome specialized mining licenses rather than general licenses in Sri Lanka. The sector also likes to receive funding for small mines by the Gamperaliya program.
It is encouraging that the mining sector is actively voicing these issues. I see an active section of mining sector calling for positive reforms and that is a good sign since the government wishes to increase the share of mining in GDP.During the August 14 session, experts showed that thanks to a spinoff firm of SLINTEC, Sri Lanka now has the latest graphene processing technology which can produce multi-layered graphene (from locally mined graphite) at half the price (around US $ 6000) of the current international price (at $12000) liberally quoted by foreign graphene suppliers who rein the global markets. The Mining and quarrying activity contributes nearly 2.7% to Sri Lankas GDP. In the first quarter of 2018 output value of mining and quarrying was an estimated US $ 625 million with a reported 0.6 percent growth rate in the (compared to Q1 of 2017). The sub sector Mining of construction material is the highest contributor to the overall Mining and quarrying activity (large scale constructions such as the Port City creating the demand). Managing Director,CEO of GraphitKropfmuhl GmbH Thomas Junker, Chief Minister of Sabaragamuwa Province Maheepala Herath and several others participated.

Hidden political agendas behind crippling medical and transport strikes
With reports of a meeting between former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and several trade union bosses coming to light, concerns are mounting about more strikes in key service sectors in the near future to raise public ire especially ahead of a major rally planned by the pro-Rajapaksa Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna next month.
Former President Rajapaksa met with several trade union leaders linked with his faction last Monday (13) at the Abhayaramaya temple in Narahenpita. The meeting was purportedly to discuss an alleged impending crackdown on unions by the Government.
In a coincidental turn of events, the recent GMOA token strike and the railway strike followed a previous meeting with the former President at his Wijerama residence in early August.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera who refused to negotiate demands with railway unions until they called off the strike, said the crippling and unethical trade union actions smacked of political sabotage.
Other Government members have also drawn attention to links between the main railway union boss behind the recent wildcat train strike, Indika Dodangoda, and SLPP strongman and former Minister Basil Rajapaksa. Dodangoda has also been linked to former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama, who has not denied allegations that the railway union boss is a relative.
Another railway strike is reportedly in the offing unless the Government gives into the demands of the unions for better wages, despite the sector being one of the best remunerated public services in the country.
Meanwhile the medical profession is also deeply divided over continuous allegations that GMOA boss Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya is a disciple of the former President and his clan. Dr Padeniya breached all codes of professional conduct when he laid bare his political affiliations by endorsing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the 2015 presidential elections and mobilised support for Rajapaksa among his GMOA membership. This month, the GMOA token strike coincided with a small JO rally in Colombo planned on the same day.
Even within the GMOA, opinion is divided on whether the political aspirations of the Padeniya faction should determine the course of action and the timing of that action by the doctors union. Some medical professionals have also expressed concerns that the GMOAs only demands relate to matters outside its domain- such as the Singapore FTA - or benefits and privileges for its membership. The union never strikes about a lack of doctors or facilities in a hospital, or the state of patient care in rural base hospitals, one GMOA member, speaking on condition of anonymity complained.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Medical Association President Dr. Ruvaiz Haniffa also weighed in recently on unethical strikes by the GMOA. It was the GMOAs right to launch trade union action, Dr Haniffa said, but it should never be at the expense of patients. They may have a right to go on strike but certainly not by holding patients to ransom, Dr Haniffa said.
Ironically, many of these pro-Rajapaksa trade unions have launched a series of strikes to oppose policies and circulars put in place while the former President was in power.
The GMOA, which did not launch strikes when the SAITM was established in 2008, or when former President Rajapaksa accepted it as a medical and engineering degree awarding institute in 2011 via gazette, or even when scholarships were handed out by the Government to SAITM students in 2013, but mobilised crippling protests against the private medical college only after the fall of the Rajapaksa regime in 2015.
Similarly, the railway salary and grade anomaly was created by the circular 6/2006 of the Salaries Commission. However, only one major strike was conducted by the Railway TUs from 2006 till 2014, while four, including two major strikes were conducted since December 2017.

HNB AND WASANA JOIN TO PROVIDE 50 VITZ CARS AT LOWEST PRICES
Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited, which claims ownership to the largest automobile showroom in Sri Lanka, has decided to distribute 50 Toyota Vitz F motor vehicles belonging to the 2015 and 2016 models, to customers during the month of August at a price even lower than the import price.
As this offer is only valid until the 31st of August, the company invites customers to enjoy this benefit before its too late by visiting the main Wasana Trading Lanka showroom located at Welisara, Ragama or through the other branches located in Colombo, Anuradhapura, Madampe and Matara.
Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited provides this offer by joining hands with the Hatton National Bank. Accordingly, during this period of time, by promptly obtaining a lease facility at the lowest installments and lowest interest rates through HNB Leasing, customers are given the opportunity to acquire a valuable Vitz motor vehicle on that same day. Another feature of significance in this program is that permit owners are able to purchase a Vitz motor vehicle by handing over their permit to Wasana Trading Lanka.
With the recent increase of tax by the government on vehicles that possess an engine capacity less than 1000cc, the prices of Wagon-Rs and other vehicles in that category increased by 4-5 lakhs. Since the taxes on Vitz motor vehicles, that possess an engine capacity of 1000cc, were not increased, it has produced a high demand for such models in the automobile market. Due to this demand, the purchase price of Vitz motor vehicles in Japan has also risen by roughly 2 lakhs. Because of this reason, prior to an increase in price in the motor vehicles in the automobile market in this country, we have decided to give our customers another valuable benefit by giving away 50 Vitz motor vehicles from our stocks at a very affordable price. said Mr. Indika Sampath Merenchige, managing director of Wasana Trading (Pvt.) Ltd.
While customers can modify with additional equipment to these motor vehicles as they please, the unique support services of Wasana Care that is affiliated with Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited, are also acquired by these vehicles. With over 25 years of experience in the automobile industry, gaining the unbroken trust of customers by providing them with high standard and the highest quality vehicles, Wasana Trading Lanka (Pvt.) Limited takes the leading position in motor vehicle dealership in Sri Lanka today by providing all the necessary facilities for the purchase of motor vehicles under one roof.

Hope for a new autism treatment
Scientists have discovered a defunct gene that affects most autism patients. Known as CPEB4, the gene controls the expression of around 200 other genes that have previously been associated with the condition, a Spanish study found.
The researchers believe CPEB4 may be affected by environmental factors that alter a persons brain development and increase their risk of the spectrum disorder.
Previous findings suggest children may be at a greater risk of autism if their mothers were exposed to certain chemicals or battled an infection during pregnancy. Certain epilepsy drugs and a lack of oxygen at birth are also linked to the condition. The scientists hope their discovery will help in the development of new autism treatments and methods of diagnosis.
More than 695,000 people in the UK are thought to be on the autistic spectrum. The disorder affects around one in 59 children in the US.
Protein changes genes linked to autism
Lead author Jos Lucas, from the Spanish National Research Council, Madrid, said: Upon studying the changes in protein expression in a mouse model with altered CPEB4 activity, we were surprised to observe that the changes included most of the genes that predispose individuals to autism spectrum disorder.
Co-author Alberto Parras added: Since CPEB4 is known to regulate numerous genes during embryonic development, this protein emerges as a possible link between environmental factors that alter brain development and the genes that predispose to autism.
They concluded: Understanding the biological bases of autism may facilitate the design of future experimental treatments and diagnosis tools for this condition. Although further research is required, CPEB4 emerges as a potential new therapeutic target.
New cancer drugs could halt autism symptoms and prevent their onset
This comes after research released last June suggested drugs under development for cancer could halt autism symptoms by blocking a protein linked to both conditions.
Unnamed medications that stop the protein ERK2 reaching the brain reverse autism-like symptoms in mice, a study found.
When given to pregnant rodents, the drugs not only ease the mothers symptoms, such as hyperactivity, but also prevent their offspring from being born with the disorder, the research adds.
Lead author Professor Riccardo Brambilla, from Cardiff University, said: It could be possible, in principle, to permanently reverse the disorder by treating a child as early as possible after birth.

Inexpensive robots powered by popcorn
Scientists have created a simple, inexpensive robot powered by popcorn, paving the way for a new range of minimalistic devices that can grip, expand or change rigidity.
Popcorn kernels, when heated, can expand more than 10 times in size, change its viscosity by a factor of 10 and transition from regular to highly irregular granules with surprising force.
The goal of our lab is to try to make very minimalistic robots which, when deployed in high numbers, can still accomplish great things, said Kirstin H Petersen, assistant professor at Cornell University in the US.
Simple robots are cheap and less prone to failures and wear, so we can have many operating autonomously over a long time. So we are always looking for new and innovative ideas that will permit us to have more functionalities for less, and popcorn is one of those, said Petersen.
The study is the first to consider powering robots with popcorn, which is inexpensive, readily available, biodegradable and of course, edible. Since kernels can expand rapidly, exerting force and motion when heated, they could potentially power miniature jumping robots.
Edible devices could be ingested for medical procedures. The mix of hard, unpopped granules and lighter popped corn could replace fluids in soft robots without the need for air pumps or compressors.
Pumps and compressors tend to be more expensive, and they add a lot of weight and expense to your robot, said Steven Ceron, a doctoral student at Cornell.
With popcorn, in some of the demonstrations that we showed, you just need to apply voltage to get the kernels to pop, so it would take all the bulky and expensive parts out of the robots, said Ceron.
Since kernels can not shrink once theyve popped, a popcorn-powered mechanism can generally be used only once, though multiple uses are conceivable because popped kernels can dissolve in water, he said.
Robotics is really good at embracing new ideas, and we can be super creative about what we use to generate multifunctional properties, Petersen said.
In the end we come up with very simple solutions to fairly complex problems. We dont always have to look for high-tech solutions. Sometimes the answer is right in front of us, she said.

JO agitating for nothing - Minister Ganesan
Minister Mano Ganesan said he could not understand why the Joint Opposition (JO) was so agitated about Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa being questioned by the Police as even the President can be summoned by the Judiciary under the Constitution.
He was speaking at a recent public event in Kandy.
The Minister said that all are equal before the law and today the President, Prime Minister, a minister or a parliamentarian can be summoned by the judiciary if it wanted.
The Minister said the against this backdrop, why the JO was shouting hoarse about Rajapaksa being questioned by the Police.
He said that today the JO was trying to highlight such trivial matters as they have no slogans against the government and have become politically bankrupt.
Ganesan said that by shouting against Rajapaksa questioning, the JO was trying to avoid talk about their latest defeat of not being able to win the Opposition Leader Post in Parliament.
He said that as the JO members contested on the UPFA ticket; they will even lose their parliament seats if they tried to become independent.
He said the JO was trying to scuttle governments efforts in making a new constitution.

Keep away garden bugs
Pests can wreak havoc in your home garden if you are not careful. They can undo all the good work and ruin a flourishing home garden. A Home Garden is self- sufficient and healthy providing a familys daily food intake. It gives mental satisfaction and physical exercise. It is also a solution to the plastic wastage problem in a country. It has a positive impact on society. Today Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Directors Office of Agriculture Ratmalana, Development Officer Gihan Siriwardhana on how to control the pest menace in Home Gardens.
There are a wide variety of pests that can attack a home garden. They are Mites, Slugs, Caterpillars and Mealybugs. Together they pose a formidable threat to any home garden.
The nurseries are attacked by mites. We fight this threat by Neem (Kohomba) extracts. When it comes to slugs we can extract them with our hands. This is done at night. Caterpillars have chewing mouthparts. If left unchecked caterpillars are known to severely damage a crop as they feed on a variety of plants. Some caterpillars consume entire leaves where as others just nibble holes in them. Some feed on the leaf surface, scraping away the top layer and causing damage. Many caterpillars feed voraciously and are known to strip a plant nearly bare. To combat caterpillars Neem extracts can be used, said Siriwardhana.
With more than 6,000 species, Thrips are tiny insects with tiny wings that damage plants by sucking their juices. Thrips create white patches that can be seen on leaves. Stem boring insects can kill or deform entire plants. These pests can cause so much damage in a few days that the plant might be dead within a week.
To control pests there are many methods. One method is using planting materials that have no pests such as stem cuttings, small suckers and seedlings. The second method is careful observation. When we see signs of pest attack, we must remove and destroy that part of the plant. Another method is covering the harvest by using paper coverings, polythene materials, nets and fabric materials. These are used for trees like Mango, Guava and Pomegranate.
Organic Pesticides such as Neem seed extract can be used for pest attack when it comes to vegetable and fruit cultivation. The extract is suitable to control mites, pod borers, Thrips, sap sucking insects, leaf miners and white flies. White flies typically feed on the undersides of plant leaves. These white flies are some of the most dangerous pests causing much crop losses. What they basically do is suck sap. A leaf miner feed within the tissue of the leaves, selectively eating only the layers that have the least amount of cellulose. They feed between the upper and lower surfaces of leaves, Siriwardhana explained.
Siriwardhana also pointed out that to combat the pest menace certain traps can be used. The fruit fly pheromone trap can be used to control fruit fly damage.
Inside the trap, (a plastic bottle) there is a pheromone which the male fly is attracted to. When it goes into the trap it cannot come out. Male Fruit flies everywhere in the vicinity are trapped in this trap. The same applies to the Melon Fly. But here the pheromone is different. The Melon fly normally attacks Snake Gourd, Ridge Gourd and Bitter Gourd. In addition to all of this there are the Coconut Read Weevil trap and the Coconut black weevil trap, pointed out Siriwardhana.
There is also another ingenious way where a grease polythene trap is used. Here two feet of yellow coloured polythene is used. A grease layer is applied to this polythene and the polythene is hung around the garden. The flying insects will get stuck there. This is especially advisable for thrips.
Of course in addition to these pest attacks, rats are a problem as well. For this in we can use a simple rat trap. To get rid of bigger animals sounds and lights can do. Bats that are attracted to Rambutang cultivations can be chased away by lights, and sounds can be used to get rid of squirrels and parrots, said Siriwardhana.

Kofi Annan: A Global Icon
Kofi Annan, who passed away on Saturday in Geneva at the age of 80, may have been African but he was a true citizen of the world who almost single handedly reshaped the mission and vision of the United Nations which he headed from 1997 to 2006. Midway through his two terms, he won the Nobel Peace Prize along with the UN for their work for a better organised and more peaceful world.
Kofi Atta Annan was born on April 8, 1938, into an elite family in Kumasi, Ghana, the son of a provincial governor and grandson of two tribal chiefs. He shared his middle name Atta - twin in Ghana's Akan language - with his twin sister, Efua. He became fluent in English, French and several African languages, attending an elite boarding school and the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi.
After studying in Ghana and at Macalester College in St. Paul, in the US state of Minnesota, he joined the United Nations in 1962 as a low-ranking officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. His initial plan was to stay on only for a few years but he ended up working there almost for the rest of his life, until he became its Chief. He was the first African to hold the post of the worlds top diplomat and also the first to climb to the top from within the UN. The fact he was selected uncontested for a second term speaks volumes about Annans commitment to the UN.
Incidentally, Annans passing away occurred just a few days after the loss of an equally high profile black global icon  Aretha Franklin, the Queen of Soul and a few months after the birth centenary celebrations of legendary South African statesman Nelson Mandela, which Annan attended.
In many ways, Kofi Annan was the United Nations, current U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. He rose through the ranks to lead the organisation into the new millennium with matchless dignity and determination. In fact, the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), largely envisioned by Annan, are regarded as his prime legacy. They made a visible transformation in the developing world and have now morphed into Sustainable Development Goals, to be attained by 2030. He also played a central role in creating the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the U.N.'s first counter-terrorism strategy.
Called by Bill Gates as one of the greatest peacemakers of our time, Annan nevertheless faced one of the most turbulent periods in human history while helming the UN. He bitterly opposed the Iraq War along with most Members of the UN and regularly sparred with the leadership of the US, which led the war. "I think that my darkest moment was the Iraq war, and the fact that we could not stop it, Annan said in a February 2013 interview with TIME magazine.
There were other dark moments too. Just before becoming Secretary-General, Annan served as U.N. Peacekeeping Chief and as special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, where he oversaw a transition in Bosnia from U.N. protective forces to NATO-led troops. The U.N. peacekeeping operation faced two of its greatest failures during his tenure: the Rwanda genocide in 1994 in which around 800,000 people were killed and the massacre of Muslim boys and men in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995. This was to haunt him for the rest of his life and he admitted that more should have been done to prevent both atrocities. As Secretary-General, Annan turned these experiences into a doctrine called the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) - that countries accept- at least in principle - to prevent genocide, crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing and war crimes.
At a farewell news conference, Annan listed as top achievements the promotion of human rights, the fight to close the gap between extreme poverty and immense wealth and the U.N. campaign to fight infectious diseases like AIDS. Even out of office, Annan never completely left the U.N. orbit. He engaged in special roles, including as the U.N.-Arab League's special envoy to Syria in 2012. He remained a powerful advocate for global causes through his Kofi Annan Foundation until his death. He also joined The Elders, an elite group of former leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, eventually succeeding Desmond Tutu as its chairman.
At the end of his Nobel acceptance speech Annan reminded the world why the UN mattered to him and the entire world. Beneath the surface of states and nations, ideas and language, lies the fate of individual human beings in need, he said. Answering their needs will be the mission of the United Nations in the century to come.
Indeed, when he departed from the United Nations in 2007, he left behind a global organisation that had undergone a radical transformation internally and was far more aggressively engaged in peacekeeping, fighting poverty, human rights and social development. The UN is still not perfect and more reforms are needed, but Annan was a guiding light who showed that global cooperation under the UN principles can create a perfect world.

The Governments target of making the Sri Lankan tourism industry as the top foreign exchange earner will come into live with the launching of the new LocoMole Sri Lanka Digital App, Tourism Minister John Amaratunga said.
Minister Amaratunga was addressing the launch of Sri Lankas first-ever mobile technology LocoMole Sri Lanka App . The App will enhance foreign travelers visiting Sri Lanka to locate their travel destinations and other relevant information during their stay in the country .
The LocoMole Sri Lanka digital App was launched by LDR Technologies with the partnership of Mobitel. LDR Technology is a mobile technology company specializing in location based services and technology enabled learning solutions.
Minister Amaratunga highlighted that the countrys tourism industry could be further expanded with the launching of many such new innovations in future.
He said with the help of this new LocoMole digital App, foreign travelers could easily find out local travel destinations and it will also help local tourists as well as all stakeholders who are engaged in the industry. He said although many such Apps are used in Sri Lanka today they have only one dimensional experience to the user.
 But, the LocoMole Sri Lanka digital App has unique features as it covers almost all territories in Sri Lanka, especially many places of interest such as Sigiriya, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Dambulla. 
Minister Amaratunga said the Government is focusing attention towards passing more benefits even to develop the tourism sector in rural areas to uplift the rural economy.He said unlike in the past foreign tourists mostly love to visit the countrys rural and remote areas where very famous tourist interested sites are located.
As a result of this even Colombo hoteliers are complaining that almost all foreign travelers seek to visit tourist locations miles and miles away from the city,.
The Minister also said the newly launched digital App will not only provide travelers all relevant information about the places where they visit in the country but also they will get to know about details of local service providers such as hotel accommodations , tour guides, retailers, craftsmen etc.

The provisions stipulate that no President can hold the Executive Presidency for more than two terms.
He pointed out that some groups are trying to establish a notion that former President Rajapaksa could contest in the coming Presidential Election based on certain legal arguments.
Minister Rajapakshe further said neither former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga nor Mahinda Rajapaksa are allowed to run for a third term as the 19th Amendment to the Constitution does not allow so.
He said the Presidential Election Act states the seriousness of a disqualified person handing over nomination to contest in a Presidential Election. He pointed out that legal action could be taken against a candidate who gives a false statement on his or her qualification to contest at a Presidential Election.
When a person wants to contest in a Presidential Election, he or she has to hand over his or her nomination along with a sworn statement which says that he or she is not a disqualified person to contest as a Presidential candidate.
If a person who has become a President twice, requests to compete as a candidate for a third term, that person will also have to give a sworn statement saying that he or she is not disqualified to contest. If such a statement be given, that would become a false statement. It will become a lie. According to the Penal Code Provision 190, a person giving a false sworn statement is subject to three years imprisonment, Minister Rajapakshe pointed out.
Minister Rajapakshe made these observations at a press brief held at Nawala yesterday afternoon.
Minister Rajapakshe, commenting on certain parties stating that they are going to seek the Supreme Courts opinion on the matter, pointed out that only the President can seek opinion from the Supreme Court with regards to it.
No one other than the President can directly seek an opinion from the Supreme Court. Even if they do, the Supreme Court will discard the requests, the Minister added.
Asked if a person who has served two terms as a President is qualified or not to hold the post of Prime Minister, Rajapakshe said that it does not affect a person to hold office as a Prime Minister, a Minister or a Member of Parliament.
Asked when the next Presidential Election would be declared, Minister Rajapakshe said that President Maithripala Sirisena will be able to, if necessary, call for a Presidential Election at the completion of the fourth year of his office.

Mangala against age bar for tri-shaw drivers
Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that he is against the newly introduced law that prohibits persons below 35 years from becoming tri-shaw drivers.
The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry last month gazetted new regulations under the Motor Traffic Act which stipulated that every person who applies to obtain a licence to drive a public service motor tricycle must be not less than 35 years and not more than 75 years.
Minister Samaraweera speaking at an event on Saturday to launch a dedicated desk for Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme at the Regional Development Bank in Matara expressed his opposition to the newly imposed law. I requested to bring down the age limit restriction to 25 years.
We must not block the right to occupation of any person, he noted.
The minister, commenting on granting public sector jobs, pointed out that many public institutions are presently overstaffed and that recruiting more to the public sector adds more financial burden to those institutions.
In fact the government service cannot afford to recruit more. In some public offices where only 1,000 public servants are needed, there are about 3,000 workers. It is a sin to fill more and more people into these public institutions and I am also a part of that sin. Overstaffing is a reason for those institutions making losses, he explained.
The minister however pointed out that there are ample job opportunities in the private sector, and that there are labour sector jobs which offer better salaries than what the expats in the Middle East receive.
If our workers are reluctant to take up such jobs, we have no options but to get labourers come from China, India and Myanmar to take them up, he added.
Minister Samaraweera also stressed that the time has come to end the era where youth lined up in front of ministers offices to get jobs.
We have started a new era where the people are empowered to take the responsibility for their future without going after politicians, he stated.
