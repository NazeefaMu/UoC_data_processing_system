A boost for Vision 2025
Moneragala is one of the most impoverished regions of the country and indeed, many Northern villages which bore the brunt of the conflict for 30 years are in much better shape than some of the villages around Moneragala. The Government, which has formulated two village development programmes called Grama Shakthi (Strength for Villages) and Gam Peraliya (Village Revolution), has realised the need to literally lend a helping to enterprising youth in both urban and rural areas to rejuvenate the economy. This is the premise behind the Enterprise Sri Lanka and Vision 2025 programmes of the Government, which envisions a more economically empowered nation by the titular year. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are personally leading these efforts, which exemplify the Governments commitment to rural development at the highest levels.
It is therefore appropriate that the first-ever Enterprise Sri Lanka Exhibition was held in Moneragala, an area aspiring to break out of poverty and under-development. According to our reporters, the Enterprise Sri Lanka National Exhibition centred on reconciliation, democracy and development that ended yesterday was a resounding success. The exhibition consisted of 12 zones and 515 trade stalls of private and public sectors to raise awareness among the public on the implementation of the recently launched interest subsidized loan scheme under Enterprise Sri Lanka. The exhibition also apprised the public of the progress of present and future development projects of the Government. Several village-level infrastructure projects initiated under the Gamperaliya rapid rural development programme in parallel to the exposition were also launched. In addition, several rural and provincial roads will also be developed and all schools in the district without access to proper sanitation facilities will be provided with such facilities.
This is no flashy exhibition unlike Deyata Kirula, which was an extravagant carnival held by the previous regime, spending billions of rupees of public funds. On the other hand, Enterprise Sri Lanka is an expo with a purpose where the people, especially the youth, are the direct beneficiaries. And Moneragala is only the beginning. In a bid to take the culture of entrepreneurship to villages, improve livelihoods and usher in prosperity, the Government is planning to conduct this series of awareness campaigns islandwide including Jaffna and Anuradhapura to facilitate the implementation of Enterprise Sri Lanka. The expositions will educate the public on the Governments recently launched accelerated rural infrastructure investment scheme, Gamperaliya, a key highlight of the Governments hallmark future economic development policy programme, Vision 2025.
State universities can only accommodate around 25,000 students per year, which means that around 150,000 students are left out of such higher educational opportunities. Instead of waiting for Government jobs to materialize, these youth can opt for many other avenues including self-employment and Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) projects. But there are many impediments to starting such projects, the lack of credit being one of them. Many banks hesitate to grant loans to these youth, as they often have no collateral or no prior experience in such projects. This is where Enterprise Sri Lanka comes in with flexible loan schemes facilitated by the Government itself.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative, launched in July this year, with an allocation of over Rs. 5.2 billion comprises 16 credit financing schemes under three categories - interest subsidy loan scheme, donor-funded refinance loan scheme and financial and non-financial support programme. A total of 11 loan schemes are offered under the interest-subsidy scheme including Ran Aswenna, Govi Navoda, Riya Shakthi, Rivi Bala Savi, Diri Saviya, Jaya Isura, Sonduru Piyasa and Madya Aruna. The donor funded refinance loan scheme consists of three categories - Rooftop Solar Power Generation Project, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises Line of Credit Project and Pavithra Ganga Initiative.
The objective of the programme is to support young entrepreneurs in villages and strengthen their small businesses by providing capital on easy terms through the State-owned banks. The loan schemes address financing needs of small scale farmers, agro and fish processing establishments, poultry producers, potential home and vehicle buyers, women and youth. All state banks and branches have set up a special desk and Relationship Manager to handle Enterprise Sri Lanka loans. The Government has set aside Rs 200 million per electorate for the next four months and intends to inject more money into the rural economy. Sri Lanka is a primarily agricultural country with a majority rural population. However, as in most other countries, many rural youth are coming in search of white collar jobs in the cities, leaving the traditional vocations of their fathers such as farming and fishing. These must be modernised to appeal to the rural youth. A youth who literally does not like to get his feet wet may still like to do farming seated in the A/C cabin of a brand new tractor. Enterprise Sri Lanka can make it possible. Youth have many dreams that can take them to the top and Enterprise Sri Lanka has the potential to take them there.

Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya opens turf wicket and revamped play ground
Dharmapala Vidyalaya Pannipitiya unveils the turf wicket of the newly developed playground today (September 1) at 2.00 pm. An eminent alumni of Olcott schools fraternity, the former president of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), Member of Parliament, Thilanga Sumathipala will be the chief guest. This historic occasion will coincide with a Col. Henry Steel Olcott commemoration cricket match between Old Dharmapalians XI and Olcott Schools combined XI on the new turf wicket.
Established in 1940 on a land owned by Ven. Anagarika Dharmapala, Dharmapala Vidyalaya, Pannipitiya is the largest Buddhist mixed school in Sri Lanka with over 5000 students and 225 teaching staff and one of the leading schools pioneered by Col. Henry Steel Olcott.
The playground was in an unusable condition with 90% of the ground devoid of grass. The Old Dharmapalian Sports Club and the Past Pupils Association with the blessings of the management of the Dharmapala Vidyalaya in the refurbishment and upgrading of the college grounds.
The new playground development project was launched in 2016 to develop the entire ground covering nearly five acres at an estimated cost of Rs.30 million. Of this amount approximately 90% has been expanded on the workload completed up to now with the former SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala having contributed a major share of this amount.
Following the redevelopment, the playground has become a masterpiece with 7turf wickets and a Matting wicket, 6 side nets, extended areas for Athletics, Soccer, Rugby and many other sports.It will also facilitate clubs and national level cricket and sports events. This high quality playground is equipped with over 100 nozzle sprinkling system and asound irrigation system which are mandatory for a playground of this caliber.
The re-developed playground of Dharmapala Vidyalaya also bridges a yawning gap (non-existence of a proper playground for cricket and other sports after Colombo up to Suriyawewa, Hambanthota), which will, undoubtedly, contribute to enhance cricket as well as the other sports nationally as well as internationally.
The playground originally came into being due to the untiring endeavours of then Principal of Dharmapala Vidyalaya, G C Edirisinghe.
Dharmapalas first inter school cricket match was played with Mahinda College, Galle at Dharmapala grounds.
The late Mr.Kapugeekiyana, an active member of Old Dharmapalians Sports Club, was the first college captain.
The first win over a leading school was recorded during Dharmapalas third year of cricket under the captaincy of Upali de Silva, against Dharmaraja College, Kandy in Kandy.
Dharmapala has produced national level Athletes, Cricketers, Soccerists and Ruggerites.
The next mission of the Old Dharmapalians Sports Club, Past Pupils Association and the School management is to build the other facilities such as pavilions, media centers, score board on par with the international standards.

Families of enforced disappearance victims speak out
Family members of disappeared persons across Sri Lanka came together and shared their stories of struggle and suffering on the International Day of the Disappeared.
Their words evinced unity, formed through immeasurable pain, between Sri Lankans of the North and South who have had family members become victims of enforced disappearances over the decades.
For twenty years, I have been waiting for the arrival of my son,said Visaka Dharmadasa, who is the mother of a soldier who went missing in action.
There is a clear difference between a person that is missing and a person that is killed, she said.She explained how difficult it is to cope with a disappearance, split between the hope of finding him and the anticipated agony of his confirming that he is gone forever.
Sometimes, I go following a young person on the street, thinking he is my son, she said. When I went abroad, I thought I might find my son. I am always suffering. Shain Shaibunnisha came from Puttalam to bring attention to her brothers disappearance. Hewas just 17 years old when he was kidnapped by the LTTE 30 years ago.
Families from the South shared similar sentiments.
Anula Ariyavathi spoke of experiencing intimidation tactics and sexual harassment when she went searching for answers regarding a missing family member in Matara.
There was no one to help us, there was no one to provide us with any answers, she said. Amidst their emotional struggle, Anulas family suffered financially too. We had to bear the full responsibility of being the head of the household, there was no one to give us even a 1,000 rupees, she said.
Hundreds of family members attended the Office of Missing Persons(OMP) event, but for Yogendran Veena, who is missing a family member from Batticaloa, such acts of solidarity and remembrance can only go so far.
We have commemorated disappearances for many years. Commemorating is not enough. The government should take concrete action, she said, and expressed frustration with unfulfilled promises from political leaders,  the OMP is the last hope for us.

Historys most despicable land grab
International media is agog with news about land grab in South Africa and many including President Trump has thought it fit to condemned contemplated land reforms in South Africa as an unjust undemocratic land grab. The land reform bill has been withdrawn from Parliament and is to be amended. The much publicized hullabaloo is about an unborn child. The Bill intends to redress the injustices of the Native Land Act of 1913 which prohibited the Blacks to own commercial agricultural land. Today 24 years after dismantling the Apartheid State the White South Africans numbering only 9 percent of the population own about 73 percent of all commercial agricultural land.
On the contrary, the monopoly controlled international media and even their counterparts in developing countries are strangely silent about the most despicable land grab in history that has gone on for 100 years. Beginning with the Belfour Declaration in 1918 action was taken to grab Arab land in Palestine by whatever means and settle Jews.
In 1947 with the decision to carve out two states- Palestine and Israel on Palestine territory land grab resulted in the eviction of 700,000 Palestinians from their motherland.
They now numbering over a million live as refugees mainly in five neighbouring countries as refugees.
In subsequent years more territory was annexed by Israel through aggressive wars and today it is encroaching on remaining lands in the West Bank and East Jerusalem building illegal Jewish settlements.
This is in violation of international humanitarian law. The Geneva Convention for example, says the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies. Israel has been encroaching on Palestine lands in the West Bank and East Jerusalem regularly. It was only last week that it decided to build 1,000 new settlement homes in 382 colonies.
It has also passed new legislation to facilitate these settlements. It makes land grabbing and eviction of Palestinians from their legitimate homes.
Thus as the number of refugees increases, the United States has decided to reduce its aid to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
It also wants the UN to reduce the number of persons eligible for relief from 5 million to about 500, 000. On the other hand the United States grants $ 200 million aid to Israel annually. Most of it is military aid.
Israel has also built new settlements as a measure of collective punishment. For example, it responded with the construction of 3,000 new Jewish settler homes when the United Nations recognized Palestine as a non-voting Observer State in 2012.
Many illegal practices such as carpet bombing are undertaken by Israel as measures of collective punishment. Israel aggression and continuous repression has made life in occupied territories a nightmare. Palestine has the worlds highest unemployment rate of 41.7 percent.
Access to healthcare is denied to 56 percent. Sixty percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Only 3 percent of its water supply is fit for drinking. The rest is contaminated with sewerage, agro-chemicals etc.
The blind eye shown towards this grave injustice exposes not only the aggressor and its accomplices but also the international media.
Bull in a China shop
The United States seems to be afflicted with an infantile disorder. It is breaking all rules of the game in international economic relations.
The much coveted principle of free trade is thrown overboard with the United States withdrawing from international agreements on free trade with some other countries and imposing unilateral sanctions on Russia, Iran and several other countries. It has started a massive trade war with China imposing tariff increases on US $ 200 billion imports from China and announced further $ 200 billion tariff increases next week. It is also sanctioning third countries that have dealings with Iran, thus endangering relations with its erstwhile friendly countries too. It is threatening to build a wall on the Mexican border and force Mexico to pay half its cost. It has withdrawn from the Climate Accord and the Accord with Iran on use of nuclear energy.
President Trumps America First policy is undermining the global economic relations architecture. It has openly announced that it does not recognize the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.
It has left the UN Human Rights Council and the UNESCO. Will it be wrong to conclude that its behaviour is just like that of a bull in a china shop

Indian military expert praises Lankan Army
Military, first responder to national disasters - Veteran Journalist National Security Analyst, Author and Media Entrepreneur in India Nitin A. Gokhale commended the roles of the military in the region, including the Sri Lanka Army for rising to the occasion as first responders to any national disaster or natural catastrophe and taking the lead in extending assistance to the affected and victims.
He was speaking at the Session 3 (final session of the day) of the 8th Colombo Defence Seminar-2018 at the BMICH on the theme Human Induced Climate Change.
Session 3 was chaired by one of the most celebrated Chiefs of Indian Army Staff and Chairman Chiefs of Staff India, General Bikram Singh (Retd) who arrived here at the invitation of the Commander of the Army.
He said that he, as an author and a veteran journalist while living in the north east of India, collected those experiences.
South and South-East Asia are prone to massive natural disasters and inadequate training given to civilian agencies has always been of little use.
Military is the first responder in most cases in 2017 and even a few months ago in Sri Lanka. From China to Cambodia and India to Indonesia, the military has regularly come to the rescue. They perform their military tasks across the region since the military is well-located, better-trained, and enjoy the spirits of cohesive and disciplined nature.
They organise shelters, food and medicine after rescuing people from difficult situations; from restoring roads and bridges to restarting electric and water supplies.
Climate change is here to stay and is getting worse.
The more industrialized we get,there are more chances of technological disruptions. Militaries perhaps need specialised cadre for such work. Templates need to be put in place for better coordination and quicker responses.
Stressing the need to work with better coordination and planning with other agencies, armed forces always earmark a portion of resources for them and do proper planning although others do not.

Bogambara needs a face lift
Bogambara Stadium needs a face lift in the playing area, this ground was renovated into a stadium in 1972, thanks to the Special Commissioner of that time M. B. Samarakoon, who initiated the renovation work with support from local politicians such as E. L. Senanayake, Noel Wimalasena, Shelton Ranaraja,]and sports promoter E. W. Balasuriya, who assisted in raising donations through the Esela Pererhera carnival. In 1997 the Bogambara stadium was upgraded by Anuruddha Ratwatte, the then Deputy Minister of Defence. It was re-developed under the patronage of the municipal council and the agreement was after the redevelopment it will go back to the municipal council, but it did not happen. Presently the Sports Ministry owns the premises. In the early days this ground served as a venue for various sports ranging from rugby, football, hockey, athletics, basketball, softball cricket. Today the ground fees are on the high side and today sports like rugger (schools), football, and hockey are finding it difficult to keep the game alive due to lack of funds.

Kevin Pietersen wants to know who is training the England batsmen in Test cricket
In modern-day Test cricket, almost all major teams do well at home and struggle when they are up against an even marginally formidable opponent overseas. Weve seen Bangladesh beat Australia and England at home while a team like India seldom loses anything at home.
On the contrary, the English batsmen have been struggling at home when the conditions have favoured pacers and Kevin Pietersen has raised serious doubts on the team.
The Indian team is in the country with arguably their best pace bowling attack. They have the workhorse in Ishant Sharma who loves to bowl at left-handers, then there is Mohammed Shami who despite being inconsistent can produce a peach from time to time.
Jasprit Bumrah very early in his Test career has established himself as a lethal bowler with the new ball and later as well.
Then there is Hardik Pandya, the floater in this bowling attack when the opportunity comes even he has the ability to trouble the batsmen and in fact trump them as he had displayed in the previous Test match having claimed his maiden five-wicket haul.
ENGLANDS BATTING WOES
At the Ages Bowl, Joe Root won the toss and decided to bat first, he seemed to have taken a lesson from Trent Bridge. The opening spell from Ishant and Bumrah pushed them on the backfoot and they just slumped then on.
Keaton Jennings was clueless against an incoming delivery, Root got out twice in 14 balls and couldnt make it count after surviving a no ball dismissal.
Jonny Bairstow at 4, Ben Stokes at 5 and Jos Buttler didnt make a significant difference either. Meanwhile Alastair Cook after working hard for 55 balls played at one really far and was dismissed for 17.
All the Indian bowlers were up for the task and constantly troubled the English batters to push them down to 86/6. After such a dismal show Pietersen wants to know who the batting coach of the team is and who inspires them to go out there and do their best.
Pietersen tweeted- Who coaches Englands Test batsmen! Who in their setup inspires them to to be their best

## Title: Law takes on the Fight against Corruption

Law takes on the Fight against Corruption
Public interest in the handling of fraud and crime that prevailed under the Rajapaksa Regime shows a new interest with the action by the Permanent High Court Trial-at-Bar over two key figures in the past regime. Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, brother of Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary, and six others, were noticed to appear before the new court with regard to misappropriation of funds over construction of the D. A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial. This followed the High Court also issuing notice on Gamini Sedera Senarath, Chief of Staff of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and three others, on misuse of public funds under the Public Property Act, Penal Code and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
These cases mark a major change in what was seen as a long delay in the fight against corruption by of the former regime, which was a major pledge of the in the political campaign to defeat the re-election of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in January 2015. There was major public concern about investigation and legal action delays on matters of corruption by those in the Rajapaksa Regime. This led to criticism by President Maithripala Sirisena over attempts to cover up some of these probes, and led to ministerial changes in the UNP branch of the ruling coalition.
Through the past three years, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was seen as one above the law, who could not be brought before the courts, with fundamental rights petitions to prevent his arrest, and several justices recusing themselves from cases involving him, on matters of major corruption. There has been a perception the government has understandings with the Rajapaksa family in not moving strongly against its members associated with crime and corruption, or delaying and straining in action against those identified as involved in corruption.
The related delays in legal action against Gamini Senarath led to resignation of former Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from the Cabinet. The close association of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa with former high-ranking services personnel and his moves to contest the next presidential election also led to considerable suspicions of delayed or ineffective legal action against him.
The notice on Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and six others is over the misuse of Rs. 90 million of state funds to build the D. A. Museum and Memorial in Medamulana, a memorial to his father, and of the other Rajapaksa siblings in politics, who held power in the last regime. The allegations involve the misuse of such funds with no oral or written contracts with the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation and the DA Rajapaksa Foundation for this construction, and use of resources of the Sri Lanka Navy for this work.
The notices against Gamini Sedara Senarath, and three others, are on high-profile financial fraud and corruption, relating to investing Rs. 500 million of public funds at Helanco Hotels and Spa, which funds had been originally given by Litro Gas Company to Canwill Holdings Ltd. This is an inquiry involving public funds of Litro Gas, EPF and other public institutions, over which Gamini Senarath the former Chief of Staff of President Mahinda Rajapaksa had much control.
The High Court Trial-at-Bar notices point to more activated moves to deal with fraud and corruption during the Rajapaksa Regime, grossly delayed, with suspicions of alleged dealings among corrupt forces across the past and present governments. These notices, with more to follow in this court, and two more such High Courts to be set up, point to the fight against the Rajapaksa corruption moving to stronger action as the Presidential and General Elections approach.
The Election Brouhaha
Sri Lankas record of an electoral democracy for more than 70 years, is taking more than a small punch with the delays in the Provincial Council polls. The decision of parliament to overwhelmingly reject the Delimitation Committee Report on the Provincial Councils, throws a major spanner in the works of the democratic process. The public expectation of timely elections to the Provincial Councils  three already awaiting polls, and more to follow soon  point to a major political disagreement on the electoral process, that seeks to combine Proportional Representation (PR) with that of First-Past-the-Post (FPP).
The rejection of the Delimitation Commission Report (DCR) by all parties, other than the JVP that was absent at voting, show a wide disagreement with the new trends in elections seen in the February 10, Local Government polls. The parties of the minorities fear the reduction of their membership in the Provincial Councils with FPP. There are major disagreements on how members are to be selected to the PCs, as seen in several local authorities. Questions are raised on formulating female representation in the PCs, seeing the problems after the LG polls.
There are strong moves to revert to the PR system, seen as politically advantageous, especially to the minorities, with little consideration to the failure of PR to have a direct link with the voter, and the overall corruption it entails. The lack of direct links with voters causes increasing youth to be uninterested in elections, with the increased influence of social media on patterns of polling.
A Committee headed by the Prime Minister will study the best amendments to the DCR, hopefully to hold the next PC polls by January 2019. With the delays already seen in tabling the debating the DCR, the promise of a January 2019 PC poll is most unlikely. The delay in these polls has the danger of moving to a clash with the coming Presidential Poll after January 2019, and the next General Election in 2020. As the PC polls are delayed there is the rise of the politics, especially vi-a-vis the Presidential Election. With the President entitled to call for the next presidential poll any time after January 2019, it will be a major challenge to have the next PC polls before the presidential poll.
The major political parties in government may see this as an advantage, with the experience of the resounding defeat both faced in the February Local Government Poll. However, the Joint Opposition (JO) also opposing the DCR shows that they too are not eager for early PC polls, although their sloganeering is one calling for early polls. The JO is entrapped in the choice of its presidential candidate. The legal arguments by those seeking a third term for Mahinda Rajapaksa, with constitutional issues on the absence of reciprocity in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, show a clear disagreement on the next presidential candidate. One fact that the JO will have to face in this situation is the candidature of Maithripala Sirisena, leading the SLFP- the Blue Party. The JO may soon be compelled to face this reality and seem political understandings among the Blues and Purples, if they are keen on keeping out the UNP.
The silence of the UNP on the constitutionality of a new Rajapaksa Third term is a sign of the new developments, emerging from delayed PC polls and the rivalries between the Blues and Purples.
Chairs and Allowances
While the delay in PC polls will have a negative impact on the democratic process, there is much cause about the realities of Provincial Council costs and payments for Municipal Councillors.
The Western Province Governor has apparently failed in the bid to prevent the Western Provincial Council from having chairs costing Rs. 640,000 each for the councillors. The public outcry against this gross waste of funds, in a province with considerable poverty, has been wholly ignored. The Provincial Councillors will have revolving comfort on their buttocks, with complete disregard to public opinion, and the actual needs of provincial expenditure, pointing to a democracy of distortion.
We now have another display of this search for peoples representatives  elected at recent polls, to benefit themselves with the funds of the people. It is gross increase of allowances to members of the Colombo Municipal Council, in total disregard of the need for economy in the management of a local authority, which may have profited from the huge rates and taxes imposed. This near doubling of allowances for Colombo Councillors, (opposed by the JO members), comes soon after Members of Parliament were compelled to stop moves to raise their allowances. A contemptuous dealing with the need for good accountability and service to the community that elected the councillors.
From luxury chairs for Western Provincial Councillors to raised allowances, plus phone and other regular costs, to Colombo Municipal Councillors, this is scornful disregard of the service necessities of those elected to serve the community. This points to the need to re-think our electoral process, bringing better and closer contact with voters, the tradition under which the best Councils were built over the years. Mayors, Chairmen, and members of the old councils had commitments to service. Can we achieve electoral reforms to restore this tradition of service

Localised insurgencies must be recognised as threats - Expert
Localised insurgencies must be recognised as a potentially existential threat to the notion of State, a defence expert told the Colombo Defence Seminar 2018 yesterday.
Commenting on the Role played by violent non -state actors on the second day of the seminar Dr. David H. Ucko, Director, Combating Terrorism Fellowship Programme, College of International Security Affairs, National Defence University, Washington, DC said, Since the defeat of the LTTE by the Sri Lankan government, we havent seen many insurgents going toe-to-toe against States."They lose or at least they dont win," he said.
He covered a wide spectrum of violent manifestations, across the globe and asserted the importance of identifying their behaviour.
Speaking on insurgents dilemma, difficulty of asserting yourself as a start-up of challenging state authority, and of establishing yourself as the new source of power, he said the track record is abysmal: not many recent cases of insurgent groups winning militarily over a state and establishing itself as the new authority has been done.Yet if this form of insurgency is dying, it will lead to adaptation.Herein that one finds the potential rebirth of insurgency as a strategic threat to democratic norms and stability, Dr.Ucko said.
He said localized insurgencies must be recognized as potentially existential threat to notion of state.

Mahapola Higher Education Trust Fund Act to be amended
The Government is to bring in a new Amendment to the Mahapola Higher Education Trust Fund Act to declare all its funds as public property and thereby imposing heavy punishments for any financial irregularities, fraud or corruption related to the Fund.
The Government has also decided to remove the Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund from the National Wealth Corporation Limited and NatWealth Securities Limited that managed the investments of the Fund in light of a series of financial irregularities.
Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said that the Mahapola Trust Fund has incurred a loss of Rs.2.5 billion from the incorporation of these companies in 2003 to December 31, 2017.
He further said the Mahapola Act would be amended to remove it from the Trade Affairs Ministry and include as a subject coming under the Higher Education Ministry. He said this was approved by Cabinet.
He said the same amendment would revise the Funds name as Lalith Athulathmudali Scholarship Trust Fund. We hope the name change will remind our university students who are benefitting from Mahapola that it was the brainchild of late Athulathmudali, he added. He said the Mahapola funds would hereafter be directly invested only in the State Banks. He said the decision to remove the Fund from the two companies was unanimously approved by Cabinet.
He however assured that outsiders who have invested their money in NatWealth Securities Limited would not be affected by this move, adding that their due sums would be returned gradually.
These two companies had been heavily politicised and mismanaged and that was a reason for the loss. In 2011, the son of then Co-operative and Internal Trade Minister Johnston Fernando was the Chairman of both these companies. He bought two BMW cars for his private use from the money in the Mahapola Trust Fund, the Minister charged.
Dr.Wickrema Weerasooria had been a Director of the National Wealth Corporation Limited, while he was a member of the Mahapola Trust Fund.
He had invested Mahapola money in a company where his son was a Director, he accused.
The minister said Cabinet approval has been obtained to seek the Attorney Generals advice on taking legal action against the persons responsible for the misuse of the Mahapola Trust Fund.
He pointed out that the Mahapola Fund is exempted from all the taxes as per the Act, but since its investments were made through two companies the Inland Revenue Department has asked to pay Rs.478 million as taxes. This was an additional expense that could have been avoided had the money was directed invested, the minister added. Mahapola Trust Fund Director Parakrama Bandara said the Fund currently has a total of Rs 10 billion and that it earns an annual income of Rs 2 billion though investments and profits from the Development Lotteries Board. Out of the 91,000 students in state universities, about 60,000 students are receiving the Mahapola scholarship. Each year it gives 15,000 scholarships to university students.

Malaysia, Sri Lanka agree to enhance water ways monitoring
Malaysia and Sri Lanka have agreed to strengthen collaboration in monitoring the waters between the two countries.
Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail had said this was among the topics discussed when she received a courtesy call from Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana on Monday in Parliament.
The government is concerned about the security of our water ways. We are striving for pirate-free waters for the safety of our traders. Our focus is in keeping peace and in keeping our traders safe, said Dr Wan Azizah.
The Foreign Minister said Sri Lanka is particularly interested in the Indian Ocean, especially on issues of security and movements of ships.
The Foreign Minister also took the opportunity to congratulate Dr Wan Azizah on Pakatan Harapans win in the recent general elections and on her appointment as the first female Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia.
It is rare for a Malay woman to come out and battle so strongly against many odds and then to rise up so swiftly and so high, Minister Marapana said.
Dr Wan Azizah, who is also the Minister of Women, Family and Community Development, attributed this to the people of Malaysia and praised the people for the smooth and peaceful transition of power, emphasising the importance of unity among the people of the country.
The Deputy Prime Minister also added that the future and development of the region very much depended on relationships between countries, such as Malaysia and Sri Lanka.
Bilateral trade between Malaysia and Sri Lanka increased by 24.7 per cent to USD415.5 million from January to June 2018 compared to USD333.1 million in the corresponding period of 2017.
Malaysias exports to Sri Lanka include palm oil and palm-based products, chemicals and chemical products, petroleum products, electrical and electronic products, machinery, appliance and parts. Imports include textiles, clothing and footwear, processed food, natural rubber, rubber products, and chemical products. There are 47 Malaysian companies currently operating in Sri Lanka mainly in telecommunications, energy, hydro-power, construction, lubricant blending, resort development, and education.

McCain returns to US Capitol for last time
US: Americans yesterday honoured the late national icon John McCain, whose remains were to lay in state in the US Capitol as part of a momentous sendoff for the warrior-turned-politician.
Hundreds of members of Congress, including his 99 Senate colleagues, are expected to attend the ceremony, a somber Capitol Rotunda honor that has been accorded to just 30 Americans throughout the nation's history.
McCain's final visit to Washington, where he served in Congress for 35 years, will take place over two days.
It includes a memorial service Saturday during which former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- a Republican and Democrat who each ended McCain's White House dreams -- will deliver remarks.
The former aviator who spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, and returned home to launch a respected political career that saw him win the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, will be buried Sunday at the US Naval Academy in nearby Annapolis, Maryland.
On Friday , his coffin will be escorted into the Rotunda and placed on a wooden platform known as a catafalque, first used in 1865 to bear the casket of assassinated president Abraham Lincoln.
John McCain was a giant of our time -- not just for the things he achieved, but for who he was and what he fought for all his life, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday.
McCain was a patriot and was in service to our country his entire life. We're going to miss him, tweeted Senator Bob Corker, who like McCain has been an occasional critic of President Donald Trump.
The funeral services for McCain, who for months planned his farewell before he died Saturday at age 81 after a yearlong battle with cancer, is seen by many as a thinly veiled rebuke of Trump, whose open disdain for McCain has alarmed many. Vice President Mike Pence will address the gathering instead, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and National Security Advisor John Bolton in representing the administration.
McCain's widow Cindy and seven children, along with his 106-year-old mother Roberta McCain, will be present, along with his staff, state governors, diplomats and other dignitaries.
McCain's remains were flown by military aircraft to Washington on Thursday from Arizona, which he has represented in Congress since his first election in 1982. Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden delivered a stirring eulogy of his friend at a memorial ceremony in Phoenix, describing Arizona's adopted son as a brother and a giant whose belief in the soul of America helped give citizens their confidence and optimism.
Biden's words appeared at times aimed at striking a stark contrast between his former Senate colleague's integrity and conciliation and the state of political division that has been exacerbated under Trump.
Biden spoke of the values of fairness, honesty, dignity, respect, giving hate no safe harbor, leaving no one behind and understanding that as Americans, we're part of something much bigger than ourselves.
Similar themes likely will be addressed when Pence, Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell deliver remarks in the Rotunda. - AFP

Nature of warfare is shifting from physical to online - PM
The nature of warfare is shifting from physical to online, due to the increased use of computers electromagnetic spectrum and artificial intelligence in commercial, economic military and all other cutting-edge activities, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Addressing the Defence Seminar 2018 organised by the Sri Lanka Army, which commenced last Thursday (30), he pointed out that technology driven new media including Social Media is another source of non-traditional threat. New Media including social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter and other websites on the Internet are also becoming global disruptive forces. We have seen the potential of this new media to destabilise nations and affect serious change in the case of countries, like Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.
On a different but a more realistic perspective the nature of warfare is shifting from physical to online, owing to the increased use of computers, electromagnetic spectrum and artificial intelligence in commercial, economic military and all other cutting-edge activities. Critical services at risk from a cyber-assault include, but not limited to political, economic, financial, energy, transportation, security infrastructures where vulnerability management of cyber based systems has become an extremely demanding task in the face of innovative use of technology by the attackers. It is essential to apply the best practice approach to reduce national vulnerabilities immediately and to develop a robust cyber security system to prevent the disruptions by attackers with collaboration of all nation states.
Moving from the virtual battle space to the real world, we encounter new trends and shapes of violent extremism. This in the spectrum of conflict, can begin from a peaceful demonstration and swing all the way through insurgency to catastrophic terrorism. Present day conflict is in this realm and fits into the space of Irregular War (IW) the violent struggle between the state and non- state actors having access to the most modern technology. These conflicts are historically protracted and test the resolve of a nation and other parties involved. There is no quick- fix or recipe that meets all irregular threats, because the nature of the new will be alien from that of the past, the Prime Minister said.
He said the state and the military must learn its lessons from the past, but the response should be on contemporary lines of action.

New Constitution is a fundamental necessity - Sumanthiran
TNA Spokesman and Parliamentarian M.A.Sumanthiran yesterday said that a new Constitution is a fundamental necessity and the Sinhala majority should accept it.
Addressing a seminar on the new Constitution in Galle, Sumanthiran speaking in Sinhala said that the country was dragged into a protracted war as successive governments failed to give an ear to the problems of the people.
All the problems of Tamil People wont be solved by a new Constitution, but a new Constitution is fundamental. Without this, no issue can be addressed, Sumanthiran said.
He added that it is important to share the powers of governance in such a way that all people have equal citizenship rights in a country with a permanent majority. Sri Lankas Sinhala majority must itself acknowledge this injustice and clamour for reform and justice for other peoples, Sumanthiran said.
He added that the county does not need a federal system of governance and the Tamil people would accept if the Provincial Council system undergoes minor changes.

Plaints against two journalists for obstructing OIC
Panadura South Police filed plaints against two journalists for using criminal force and threatening HQI Chief Inspector Indika Thushara de Silva inside the Panadura South Police Station on February 20.
When the case was called before the Panadura Chief Magistrate Chandana Liyanage on August 29, the two provincial journalists appeared before Court on previous bail.
Sergeant Ananda filing plaints against the duo told Court that the duo had had a altercation with the HQI, Chief Inspector Indika Thushara de Silva on February 20 when a candidate of the Podujana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) died while on his way to sign nomination papers for the local elections. The body had been taken the Panadura Hospital mortuary and the two journalists had attempted to enter the hospital for a photograph of the dead candidate.
The relatives of the dead candidate had objected to the two journalists and an argument had ensued between the relatives of the candidate and the journalists opposite the hospital gate. Policemen had taken the two journalists to the Panadura North Police Station for questioning. They had later provoked the Panadura North Police HQI Chief Inspector Indika De Silva and was involved in a heated argument with him stating that they could transfer him out of the Panadura South Police station and threatened to report him to the Panadura ASP.
The two journalists had abused the HQI and obstructed his duties and later they had fled the police station.
The police charged the two journalists for using criminal force and obstructing the Panadura South Police HQI, Chief Inspector Indika Thushara de Silva from performing his duties on February 20.
The charges were read out by the Court Mudaliyar and the two accused pleaded not guilty.

The petitioner stated that on January 2, she received a letter written by a parent to the Uva Chief Minister seeking the Chief Ministers recommendation to get his daughter admitted to the Badulla Tamil Girls Maha Vidyalaya.

Pujara (132 not out) as India take first innings lead
SOUTHAMPTON Friday: India were all out for 273 with Cheteshwar Pujara, remaining unbeaten on 132 when last man Jaspit Bumrah was caught by Alastair Cook off the bowling of Stuart Broad for 6 runs which gave India a first innings lead of 27 runs on the second day of the fourth Test at Southampton on Friday.
At tea, India were 181 for five, 65 behind England's first-innings 246.
Cheteshwar Pujara, hit on the helmet by a Ben Stokes bouncer, was 70 not out, with Rishabh Pant out for a duck off the last ball of the session after Curran had dismissed star batsman Kohli for 46.
England's total owed much to the recalled Curran's Test-best 78, made after he had come in with the hosts in dire straits at 86 for six after India's pacemen had inflicted yet another top-order collapse.
India resumed Friday on 19 without loss.
James Anderson, England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker, needed six more wickets to equal retired Australia great Glenn McGrath's mark of 563 -- the most taken by any fast bowler at this level.
But it was his longtime new-ball partner Stuart Broad who made the breakthrough to have KL Rahul lbw for 19.
And 37 for one became 50 for two when Broad drew India's other opener, left-hander Shikhar Dhawan, forward and diving wicket-keeper Jos Buttler took a good low two-handed catch. Dhawan departed for 23 runs.
Kohli's duels with Anderson have been a feature of the series and the India star frustrated the England great with a textbook cover-drive for four.
But after lunch, 20-year-old Surrey rising star Curran, in just his fourth Test, took the wicket England so badly wanted when the left-arm swing bowler angled a delivery across Kohli who, in a rare error, pushed out away from his body and saw the ensuing edge well caught low at first slip by Alastair Cook.
Kohli faced 71 balls, including six fours, and put on 92 with Pujara to leave India 142 for three.
The India skipper scored exactly 200 runs in a 203-run victory in the third Test at Trent Bridge, a result that reduced England's lead in the five-match series to 2-1, having also managed the same feat in the first Test at Edgbaston.
Friday's innings saw Kohli, the world's top-ranked batsman reach 6,000 Test runs in his 119th innings at this level.
That meant he became the second quickest India batsman to the landmark after Sunil Gavaskar (117 innings). Curran had been unfortunate to be make way for the returning Stokes at Trent Bridge.
And the fact England had concerns over pace-bowling all-rounder Stokes's ability to get through a full quota of overs at Southampton because of a knee injury led to a fresh rejig of their team. Stokes had Ajinkya Rahane dropped on five by a diving Root at second slip as England spilt yet another chance in the cordon this series.
But it was not an expensive miss, with Stokes having Rahane lbw for 11.
Rahane reviewed and Stokes was fortunate not to have the decision overturned because of a no-ball, with third umpire Joel Wilson using a zoom replay to decide the paceman had a fraction of his front foot behind the crease.
Pujara, who completed a 100-ball fifty, including six fours, suffered a painful blow when he missed an intended hook off Stokes, with the batsman needing several minutes of on-field treatment as medical staff checked for concussion before resuming his innings. At the other end, the normally aggressive Pant was tied down before falling lbw for a 29-ball nought to recalled off-spinner Moeen Ali off what became the last ball before tea.

Relief for organic farmers
The Agriculture Ministry on Wednesday issued a circular providing relief to farmers engaged in organic farming.
This Circular has been issued following the directions given to the relevant authorities to implement a mechanism to provide relief for farmers engaged in organic farming by Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera promote organic farming in Sri Lanka.
According to the Circular No: 7/1/3/PSM(KP)2018/Yala, Rs.18,000 will be provided per hectare from the next Maha season for farmers to obtain organic fertiliser.
The fertiliser subsidy programme implemented during the previous regime had been cancelled by the Yahapalana Government considering the damage caused by chemical fertilisers to human lives and to the soil. Considering the repeated requests made by farmers, the government had taken measures to bring back the fertiliser subsidy programme.
Accordingly, a fertiliser subsidy is given to farmers cultivating with chemical fertiliser.
The government provides a 50 kg bulk of fertiliser for the use of paddy cultivation at Rs.500 and a 50 kg bulk of fertiliser for other crops for Rs.1,500.
However, Agriculture Ministry sources state to date,no relief has been provided to encourage farmers engaged in organic farming. About 5,000 farmers are engaged in organic farming.
Minister Amaraweera said the Cabinet approval had also been received to provide funds for the purchase of organic fertiliser for the Maha Season in 2018.

Salvation Army releases first public annual report
The Salvation Army unveiled its first public annual report for Sri Lanka Answering the Callon Thursday.
The Salvation Army also announced their target for the 2018 Annual Appeal target, totalling Rs.5.5 million and their first donations, which amounted to Rs.2 million.
The release of the report marks a significant change in The Salvation Armys approach to charity in Sri Lanka. According to the Chair of The Salvation Armys newly-established National Advisory Board, Eraj Wijesinghe, they plan to collaborate with partners outside the organisation to help Sri Lanka rise up and become more self-reliant. Servicing Sri Lanka in collaboration, not isolation, is our new priority, Wijesinghe said.
Operating in the Sri Lanka since 1883, the global organisation has formed 62 outstations in the country, employing 157 officers based in Sri Lanka and working eight of the nations nine provinces and 20 of 25 districts.
Wijesinghe recounted the 135 years of involvement, spanning times of peace and times of great turmoil. He said The Salvation Army has become one of the leading not-for-profit organisations in SL, a challenge to the new advisory board in terms of helping it go forward to greater heights of mission and performance.
To date, the Salvation Armys projects in Sri Lanka have included nutrition programmes; island-wide residential care for mothers and babies, children and elders; and hostel accommodations for young employed and differently-abled people.
In his inaugural Address, Wijesinghe invoked the words of Mahatma Gandhi, The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members.
National Head for Sri Lanka, Colonel Yousaf Masih cited Sri Lankas economic inequality as a motivation for their philanthropic and volunteer efforts.
Like most countries on planet earth, and certainly in South Asia, there are contrasts in human life and experience in Sri Lanka that leave some people wanting for nothing while many others tread dangerously and permanently close to ruin, he said.
Its at the ruin end of humanity that you will most often find The Salvation Army in Sri Lanka, bringing transformation in some of the poorest and most at-risk communities of the country, he added.

Shane Pinder - A rugby legend and a gentlemen
To Shane Pinder, rugby is not just a game - its a passion and a passionate pastime in his life. As a financier he still cherishes the lessons he learnt as an outstanding rugby captain for his alma mater S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia in 1978. Perhaps, sports would have been the reason for his gaining an employment opportunity in one of USAs major financial institutions.
Talking to the Daily News in his Colombo residence hours before his departure to USA, he recalled how an illustrious sports career could help build ones character. I believe in teamwork. This is one major lesson that my favourite game - rugby has taught me throughout the years, said Shane Pinder.
Sports helped me to imbibe qualities such as leadership, sharing work, character building, delegating work, determination and having faith in my team mates, he said. Like in many others, school time was the best era of Pinders life. I owe everything to my school; actually it is not just a school, but an institution where students characters were nurtured with dignity and honesty.
Speaking further Pinder said, After winning all our matches including a 6 all draw against arch rivals Royal we unfortunately lost to Trinity 6-27 in 1978. This loss made me determined to somehow win the Centenary knock out Rugby championship in 1978 under my captaincy.
S.Thomas had great years in rugby in 1989 under Rizvie Suhaib, 1990 Naren Perera and 1991 under Charya De Saram, but Pinder chose 1978 as the pick of it.
All above are great years of our college rugby and great teams led by those fabulous leaders but I personally believe its undoubtedly the 1978 team that stands out from the rest, not because I was the captain but due to the fact that we played with only five colours men and 10 freshers, recalled Pinder.
My best moment in school rugby was when under my captaincy in 1978 in the Centenary knock out championship we won against the unbeaten league champions Royal College in the semi finals when my team mate and cracking centre Christopher Jordashe intercepted and ran nearly 85 meters to score the match winning try which I still cherish and can recall the rugby commentator Bob Harvey stating  The spectacular Jordashes try tore the heart of all Royalists. When a group of young men play as a team and not as individuals they can achieve great success against all odds. Further from that 1978 Thomian team, several players played club rugby, some captained their respective clubs and some players went on to represent the Sri Lanka national team which was a real pleasure for me as their captain, Pinder said.
Turning his attention on and going down memory lane Pinder spoke highly of his centre, ex CR & FC captain, Sri Lanka national player and 1979 Thomian captain Christopher Jordashe. Christo was a true and humble gentleman on and off the field, a superb player who at a glance knew all our moves I knew all his moves very well as the captain cum full back and supported him all the way. With our combination we scored many tries for S.Thomas. Speaking further he said Christo was undoubtedly one of the best players in the front line of the 1978 Thomian team. Pinder added that every one of his team members, gave of their best in each of their positions.
Shane Pinder had the unique feat of representing champion Havelock Sports Club in the knockout tournament in 1978 as a full back while still a schoolboy and earned a reputation as a much sought-after ruggerite.
He said in the 1977 SLRFU knock out rugby tournament, I played for Havies as a full back and came out with flying colours in the quarter finals as well as in the semi finals but I did not play in the finals as the selectors decided I was too young. I was selected to play in the 10 man touring squad for Sri Lanka national sevens team in Hong Kong and was awarded my national team jersey as well as I was in the touring 10 man team photograph.
In 1979 I decided to hang my boots and move to Australia when I sustained a knee injury during the Mercantile Sevens Tournament. I later moved to the US and have been living there since then with my wife, son and daughter.
The 10 man Sri Lankan national sevens team which went to Hong Kong sevens in 1978 comprised Bharatha Hegoda, Hisham Abdeen, late Sandy Hameed, Wimal Eparachchi, Saman Jayasinghe, Angelo Wickramaratne, Ajith Silva and Rohantha Peiris.
In conclusion Pinder said, My father, mother , my two uncles Jeff and Dan Ratnam, and STC head coach Quintin Israel Quinta have been my major inspiration in life, and I am eternally grateful to all of them.
In order for Sri Lankan rugby to improve and reach higher standards, I believe we should leave politics out of the game, and that goes for school, club and national rugby.

Sisters Alana, Anika win womens doubles crown
Sisters Alana and Anika Seneviratne swept to victory in straight sets to be crowned National Womens Doubles Champions at the Sri Lanka Tennis Nationals at SLTA courts yesterday.
The sisters seeded 2 beat top seeded Janali Manamperi and Savini Jayasuriya 7/5 4/2 (retired).
Alana and Anika led 5/2 and 0/40 in the first set but a brief lack of concentration saw them having to work harder to finish the set.

This was Anikas 3rd senior doubles final and she defended the title she won last year with Jithmie Jayawickrema successfully this year.
Alana won her 2nd major Super A womens doubles title after winning the same event with her sister at the recently concluded Colombo Championships.

SLIIT WILL BE TAKEN BACK - MINISTER
The Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) in Malabe will be taken back to the Government cancelling its transaction in 2015, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister said the SLIIT would be operated as a fee-levying Government owned independent institution. Addressing a press conference at the University Grants Commission yesterday, he said a Cabinet paper to this effect was submitted last week and it would be taken up again next week.
he said the Cabinet paper proposed to appoint a Board of Trustees composed of two higher officials each from the Presidential Secretariat and the Prime Ministers Office, the Secretaries to the Higher Education Ministry and Education Ministry and about another five members with knowledge on university affairs to take over SLIIT and operate it under an Administrative Board.
He noted that any profit earned by the institution will be diverted to the Mahapola Trust Fund and used to facilitate more scholarships.
This institute was started in 1999 on a 25 acre state land. It utilised Rs. 373 million from the Mahapola Trust Fund to construct its first building. Currently, there are 7,000 students in it. Initially its ownership was with the Government even though the management was run by a separate company. In 2015, the SLIIT was removed from the Mahapola Trust Fund and handed over to that company.The SLIIT had paid Rs.408 million to the Fund and had inked a new lease agreement for the land where Rs 20 million is paid to the Fund annually as lease. All SLIIT Director Board members were initially government officials, but now there is no single government official in it, he explained.
He pointed out that Rs. 408 million was no way a reasonable amount as the assets of the University, even when the land value is excluded, amounts to at least Rs 20 billion. Now there is no rightful owner to this institution. Who will take the responsibility of 7,000 students if it runs to any trouble he asked.
He said the above transaction had happened without the knowledge of the Mahapola Trust Fund.
In the meantime, responding to a question by a journalist, the Minister said that it has now been agreed not to charge any fee from the scholarship holders of the SAITM when transferred to the Kothalawala Defence University. He said the other students have to pay money as the KDU is a fee-levying university, but added that this fee is less than two thirds of that of the SAITM fee.
Commenting on IUSF Convener Lahiru Weerasekaras recent comment asking for an open debate with the Minister, Rajapakshe said, Lahiru Weerasekara is neither a university student nor a graduate. He is simply a loiterer on the street, a thug and a person who earns by taking other students for a ride. About 1,000 students are forced to leave universities per year because of the ragging of the IUSF. How and why should I debate with such a person he queried.
He said the case of ragging where a female undergraduate at the Sabaragamuwa University tried to commit suicide would be referred to the IGP for take legal action against the offenders for the crime of homicide.

SM stops errant Yal Devi, averts major disaster
An alert station master at the Shravasthipura railway station averted a major train accident when two trains plying in opposite directions came on the same track.
A tragedy could have occurred due to a head on collision, if not for the alert station master who signalled the offending train to stop when he saw at a distance that the trains are approaching on the same line.
An official of Shravasthipura railway station said the signal had been given to the Yal Devi express train to stop at the signal post a kilometer away from the station until the slow train from Medawachchiya on the same track arrived at the station.
The Yal Devi express train was heading forward disregarding the signal. The station master who saw the train approaching at high speed at a distance, signalled it to apply emergency brakes and changed the track too. He also signalled to stop the oncoming slow train which was heading to the station as per the signal.
The Sri Lanka Railway Department official said an inquiry would be conducted into the incident and stern action taken against those responsible.

Sri Lankan charged over terror plot
A 25-year-old Sri Lankan man living in Sydney has been charged with terrorism-related offences after plans for a terrorist attack were discovered by police yesterday. Mohammad Kamer Nilar Nizamdeen, who works as a business analyst at the University of New South Wales, was arrested in Kensington yesterday after a notebook belonging to him was handed over to the police.
Nizamdeen appeared at Waverley Local Court in Sydneys eastern suburbs this morning.
He has been charged with knowingly making a document connected to terrorism.
It is alleged that the notebook had detailed plans for a terrorist attack in Sydney, with details of specific individuals and landmarks to be targeted.
They are symbolic locations within Sydney, Detective Superintendent Michael McTiernan told reporters on Friday.
We have both psychologists and investigators looking at that document to try to interpret the intent and capability, but that is in essence the offence that is before court.
The man, who is in Australia on a student visa, is believed to be affiliated with Islamic State, Det Supt McTiernan said.
At 2 am this morning police executed a search warrant at the mans residence in Zetland and seized documentary evidence, though police said there is no suggestion of any capability posed by this individual.
Investigations of the documents seized are ongoing.
At this stage it appears that this individual operated on his own ... from the documentation he would have affiliated with ISIS, detective acting superintendent of NSW Police Michael Sheehy said.
He was not known to police prior to yesterday and had no criminal record in Australia. Nizamdeen was in Australia on a student visa, due to expire in September. He began working as a contractor at at the university after graduating from his bachelors degree.
Police will search his office at The University of New South Wales today for further evidence. His arrest was the result of an investigation conducted by the NSW Joint Counter Terrorism Team,
The JCTT includes officers from the Australian Federal Police, NSW Police, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, and the NSW Crime Commission.
He was refused bail and appeared in Waverley Local Court this morning. The case has been adjourned until the 24th of October. - THE AUSTRALIAN

They shall grow not old
September 1, 1984, is a memorable day. I had just returned from England after completing a Small Arms Training programme.
Since it was a Sunday I attended the shooting practices at Police Training College Kalutara. Basically, every weekend, Police practical shooting team assembled at this location and Ravi Jayewardene, Advisor to the then President J R Jayewardene, too was a regular member. On this day SSP Zerney Wijesuriya told me that they have formed a new Unit called Special Task Force, Police Paramilitary Unit and requested me to join the same as OIC. The reason may be, because I was an all-round sportsman and a good marksman.
Even though I did not respond in the affirmative, as I took my position at the Firing Lane, next to Ravi Jayewardene, he told me Nimal, I heard the good news, that you are joining the STF and we are very happy to have you!
I did not confirm as I had to discuss the matter with my wife, because by then we were newly married and had an eight-month-old baby. When I got back home in the evening, I told my wife about the proposal and got her consent. But in less than one hour, I got a message, that four of the STF personnel had died following a land mine explosion in Jaffna and their bodies had been brought to Ratmalana. I had to go and bring their remains to Colombo. It was a shocking news at a terrible time. It was no easy task to get my wifes consent as we were well aware of the risks involved with it. However after some time, my wife wholeheartedly extended her support throughout for which I am very grateful to her.
I joined the STF, underwent training conducted by the British Ex-SAS trainers and was posted to Batticaloa in charge of Kalawanchikudi base as base Commander. There were only two bases at that time in Batticaloa; the other one was in Kalladi where N K Ilangakoon was the Base Commander, ASP at that time later IGP.
Just two days later another shocking incident rocked the area. The jeep carrying OIC Wellaveli, IP Masamja and seven of his PCs had got caught in a landmine in Kalawanchikudi. Since they did not return on time we were asked to go in search of them. Alas, we witnessed the unbelievable. The bodies were shattered into pieces. We had never seen anything like that before. What an experience it was for a young Unit to face at a time they were entrusted with a new task!
Effective leadership
So that was the beginning of the STF. This highly trained young professional Unit was able to achieve difficult goals under the able leadership of Zerney Wijesuriya SSP Commandant, Lionel Karunasena ASP Deputy Commandant, ASP Sahabandu, Director Training ASP Ilangakoon, ASP Rohan Abeywardena, ASP Jayantha Gamage and many other young Inspectors. All who joined the STF were volunteers. Nobody was forced to join the Unit because at that time most of the Police officers were reluctant to work in the North and East.
Effective leadership at all levels has always been the power behind this Unit. The brilliant training, discipline, commitment and the unity finally proved that nothing was impossible.
STF dominated the Batticaloa Ampara sector without allowing any of the terrorist groups to have a hold. In 1984 there were many groups such as, TELO, PLOT, EPRLF, LTTE, ERROS etc. But the most effective group in the Batticaloa was the EPRLF. In 1985 during a confrontation between the EPRLF group and the STF, we managed to overrun them. After the ceasefire agreement in 1986 the LTTE started to strengthen their manpower under Prabhakarans cousin Kumarappa in Eralukulam, Kokkadicholai. Although Prabhakaran in his Eelam map had identified Batticaloa as their capital they never had a strong grip as we dominated the area. Credit should go to the troops as day in and day out they launched operations one after the other to destroy their hideouts and capture those areas. STF was mostly on the coastal belt of Batticaloa, Ampara sector. From Bakmitiyawa to Lahugala was the Army area. When the terrorists were attacking the Sinhala villages in those areas, gradually STF moved in and dislodged all their hideouts. We successfully captured all their bases namely Beiruit, 46 Base in Eralukulam, 48 Base in Kanjikudiaru.
Our concept was to dominate the areas between us and the enemy. In achieving it the price was heavy, 463 young officers had to sacrifice their lives and 712 were injured/disabled. We strongly believe that by dying for the country no one is going to win any war. If you are to be the winners at the end of the war you should live and then you are the winners.
Our top priority was the human life - whether it is our men, civilians or the terrorists. Because we believe that whatever they were demanding for, violence is not the answer. That was the message we were trying to give and I believe that all STF personnel are committed to achieve this goal. We did our duty by the nation, at no stage anyone back peddled or looked back, once a task is given to them.
There were days that they had not seen or spoken to their families for months. But they always waited for their turn as a team to get their due duty off. In retrospect, I feel very proud. I started as an Inspector and ended my career as a DIG who successfully led the STF to liberate the East. I could achieve all this purely because of the support and commitment of my officers.
The unity among us was unbelievable and we are sad to note that in 1994 when the new Government came into power a volunteer Colonel took over the Defence Ministry. People like us who did yeoman service to the nation were removed as a result.
The STF had to go through a difficult time and for the first time in the history in 1995 a STF contingent was attacked at Pulukunawa camp .That is the only time the terrorist came close to a camp and it is significant that out of the 463 officers who sacrificed their lives, 300 were killed during this period. We got back to the STF in 2002 and rectified the error and liberated the East.
VIP security
The concept of the LTTE was to dilute the Sinhala leadership, first Prabhakaran got rid of the strong Tamil leadership like Sri Sabharatnam, Eliyathambi Ratnasabhapathi, Uma Maheshwaran, Pathmanaba etc. and became the sole leader. Then he wanted strong Sinhala leadership to be diluted, which we understood very correctly, and we undertook the challenge with commitment to protect leaders of our country. We were determined that we will not allow a terrorist group to destroy our Sinhala leadership. We were bound to do that and committed to protect them. There again, Ravi Jayewardene is the great person who pioneered this programme and got specialized training from Israel and made STF VIP equal to any other VIP unit anywhere in the world.
They were highly disciplined, committed and brilliant marksmen who could draw and fire within a second and hit the targets 10 out of 10 times. More than anything their commitment and determination to protect the leaders of our country were certainly commendable. I was in charge of the STF VIP Security Unit of President J R Jayewardene after the Parliament bomb blast. Sumith Silva was the Director of PSD. On retirement, President Jayewardene made a comment The security unit led by SP Nimal Lewke is a highly professional, disciplined unit which handled all my security assignments and it is an example to the other security units in the country. Today STF security unit have set a unique record by providing security to the present President, Prime Minister, former President and many other leaders. That has proved that how professional they have been and no security unit in this country has ever achieved that unbiased, professional recognition. I also wish to mention with gratitude some of the top VIP protectors who had to sacrifice their lives not because of their mistakes or decisions.
They were victims of circumstances, as the VIP were not prepared to listen to the security advice and walked into terrorist traps. Late SP Sarath Mahinda and late SP Upali Silva were brilliant marksmen.
There were many other important tasks that STF had handled over the years. Planning out security, key installations like Parliament, BIA, Oil Refinery etc. providing security for international conferences, visiting head of states and other dignitaries etc. and assisting the Police on many occasions to maintain law and order at difficult times. The success story of STF is the real commitment of the men, discipline and the training.
I recall the advice given to me by one of my Instructors Ex-SAS officer Mr. Jordi during training,
I quote, I have been watching you closely, you have a very good future, I want to give you one advice, do not ever take shortcuts in this game. There are no shortcuts, stick to the basics, I draw my British Army pension, you will also draw your pension one fine day, if you adhere to my instructions." I not only adhered to his instructions, I got that message across to the men every time we launched operations.
At a time STF Commemorating the 34th year, I thought I put this into print as a mark of respect for the committed, dedicated, disciplined and the sacrifices they made including their own lives to defend motherland at her darkest hour. We who are left will never forget them, those bullets have gone deep into our hearts and the bleeding will be there forever.
They shall grow not oldAs we that are left grow oldAge shall not weary themNot the years contemnAt the going down of the sunAnd in the morningWe will remember them

Ven. GNANASARA THERA DENIED LEAVE TO APPEAL
An application filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera seeking the Court of Appeals permission for leave to appeal against the conviction and sentence was yesterday rejected by the Court of Appeal.
On August 8, Ven. Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to 19-years Rigorous Imprisonment, to be served concurrently within 6 years by the Court of Appeal over his contemptuous behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25, 2016.
Court of Appeal President, Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne refused to grant leave to appeal citing that there is no substantial reasons to consider the application.
However, there is no obstacle for Ven.Gnanasara Thera to file an appeal in the Supreme Court. An appeal in the Supreme Court has to be filed within 42 days following the judgment. Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne appearing on behalf of Ven. Gnanasara Thera, submitted to court three written statements on questions of law.
(1). As a matter of law can the accused be charged, convicted and sentenced separately for four seperate counts in respect of one incident that took place at Homagama Magistrates Court.
(2). Is an overall sentence of 6 years imprisonment excessive for a single incident of the contempt of the Homagama Magistrates Court having regard to the sentence of two year imprisonment imposed by the Supreme Court against S.B.Dissanayake in respect of the contempt of the entire Supreme Court.
(3). Should the mitigatory factor fact the accused did not appear before court for his own personal cause but instead due to his own patriotic sentiments for the cause of the soldiers who fought to end the war in Sri Lanka have been considered by the court in sentencing the accused.
Meanwhile, senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appearing for Attorney General raised objections for the three written statements citing that S.B.Dissanayakes case cannot be equalized to this incident which occurred in the well of the court. Ven.Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to four-years Rigorous Imprisonment in respect of the first count. Another four-years Rigorous Imprisonment was imposed regarding the second count.
Six-year and five-year rigorous imprisonments were also imposed in respect of third and fourth counts respectively.
While handing out a 56-page judgement, Court of Appeal Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne had observed that the ingredients of all four charges framed against the accused have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
At a previous occasion,Ven.Gnanasara Thera had been sentenced to six- months Rigorous Imprisonment after he was found guilty for threatening and intimidating Sandhya Eknaligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Rienzie Arsekularatne with counsel Udara Muhamdiramge and Thejitha Koralage appeared for Gnanasara Thera.

What is Yo-Yo fitness - everything you need to know about it
Cricketer Ambati Rayudu was recently in news for failing to clear the Yo-Yo fitness test. Earlier, ace hockey player Sardar Singh made the test a talking point when he beat Indian cricket team captain Virat Kohlis test score.
The Yo-Yo test has become quite a buzz word in the fitness enthusiasts universe. The test is compulsory for cricketers to clear, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Washington Sundar, and Mohammad Shami have all, at some point, failed to clear it.
To help you understand what the test is all about, we got talking to sports and exercise nutrition specialist Rishi Manuja, and fitness expert Akshay Alawani from SQUATS.
HOW IT CAME TO BE
Danish scientist Dr. Jens Bangsbo framed this test in the 90s to evaluate an athletes aerobic endurance. It was used to test the fitness level of footballers, and was later adopted by other sports. In 2017, it was introduced as a fitness parameter for Indian cricketers, and was made compulsory in October, later that year.
WHAT DOES IT CONSTITUTE
Three cones are placed on a flat surface in a straight line. You can label them cone A, B and C. The distance between cone B and C is 20km and distance between cone A and B is 5 km. Once the beep goes off, the player runs from cone B to C and then back from C to B. Once the player reaches B, they get a 10 second rest period where they run from cone B to A and back to B. As the level goes up, the time for completing the shuttle decreases. The total distance covered is their official score.
The process is software based and the results are recorded.
HOW IT HELPS
Its a test of an athletes stamina and endurance. As for cricket, it is a start-stop sport and not continuous like football or tennis. A player is physically active in periods (running between the wickets or bowling) and gets time to recover in the middle as well (fielding or when waiting for their turn to bat). The Yo-Yo test helps the player recover faster and better during the matches by strengthening their aerobic ability. For example, looking at Virat Kohli and MS Dhonis running between the wickets, they are considered as one of the fastest runners in the game, says Alawani.
Since our aerobic capacity increases, experts say that one doesnt get tired of running between the wickets or bowling. That tremendously helps a cricketer focus on batting or bowling, and improves the ability to recover from injuries.
SHOULD THE TEST BECOMPULSORY
Fitness is paramount. However, this is not a case of one-size-fits-all, according to those who are not in favour of making this test compulsory. It doesnt take in account the cricketing ability. Also, one needs to be at a certain level of fitness to take part in the test. For instance, cricketer Yuvraj Singh, is a cancer survivor. The test doesnt make sense for him as his lung capacity has reduced. However, his physical condition has no effect on his cricketing ability. Therefore, it cant be the ultimate test of ones sports ability, says Manuja.
THE YO-YO CHAMPIONS
Reportedly, New Zealands cricketers have the highest average score of 20:1. Pakistans minimum level is 17:4; West Indies is 19. And India is 16:1. Virat Kohli is considered one of the fittest athletes in the country with his score of 19: But he was recently overtaken by the hockey player Sardar Singh, who scored an astonishing 21:4.

When Michael Holdings throw knocked down stumps at both ends
England were outclassed in the 1976 home series by the touring West Indian team as they lost the 5-match Test series by 3-0 margin. After the first two Test matches ended in a draw, the visiting side drew first blood with a huge 425-run win in the 3rd game at Old Trafford in Manchester. They showed no mercy on the home team and shamed them by 55 runs and 231 runs respectively in the last two games to clinch the series.
The Test series was followed by a 3-match ODI series that began on August 26th at the Scarborough. Englands troubles against Windies pace-attack continued in the ODIs as they were reduced to 23/3. Graham Barlow rescued the hosts by constructing a 49-run 4th wicket stand with Dennis Amiss (34) and a 64-run partnership with Graham Gooch (32) for the following wicket.
ONE OF THE BEST THROWS EVER
Barlow kept riding on his luck as he was dropped at deep square leg when on 19 and Bernard Julien failed to hold on to the return catch off his own bowling when Barlow was on 38. He moved on to 71 and was set to bat out Englands innings until he responded to Alan Knotts call for a single who glanced it towards the fine-leg region. Michael Holding, who collected the ball, threw it with immense force to knock down the stumps at the wicketkeepers end.
Barlow was well inside the crease when Holdings throw rattled the stumps and no fielder was there as cover to collect the ball. At the point, Knott called Barlow to accumulate overthrows as the pair tried to steal the second run. In the interim, the ball that had hit the stumps at keepers end, deflected with still some momentum and went on to hit the stumps at the bowlers end. Both the batsmen were at mid-pitch when the stumps at non-strikers end were dislodged.
Observing that the bails were down at the far end, Windies skipper Clive Lloyd appealed for a run out dismissal. The umpires Arthur Jepson and David Constant had a long conversation to decide the fate after such an unusual occurrence. They ruled both the batsmen not out as both were well in the crease when Holdings throw hit the stumps at strikers end and did not consider the dislocation at the other end.
SAME STORY FOR ENGLAND
Barlow remained unbeaten on 80 off 139 balls which included eight boundaries as England finished on 202/8 in the restricted 55 overs.
The Caribbean team chased down the target in just 41 overs as Sir Vivian Richards scored an unbeaten 133-ball 119 with the help of 20 fours and a six. England remained unbeaten against England on the tour as they clean swept the 3-match ODI series winning the last two games while defending totals.  ct
