Celebrating island rugby and its mesmerizing traditions!

Greetings rugby fans one and all, especially those who are part of those glorious traditions that make us all, one big family.
The passions and traditions run deep, way beyond normal contemplation and quite above all other considerations, even the business of government
Island rugby has its own glamour and qualities...that stand it apart from all other sport in sunny Sri Lanka. The rugby heart at school and club level, very distinct and easily identifiable from quite a distance ...am or pm
I will run some basic details of team form and squad stats: for the Bradby encounter 2016.
Sri Lanka will be coached by Johann Taylor, the former South African born, Kandy coach, who directed the upcountry club to many titles ...created a professional platform and changed the thinking of how Kandy rugby, and how it should progress. The rest as they say is history and splendid teams that performed consistently for well over a decade.
Rugby has grown rapidly and as we speak ...is looking the part, especially if you were to catch one of the Singer schools league 1st round matches. The passion and fervour inspiringteam support quite amazing, and tantalizing research for sociologists ...looking for answers on cultural traditions and development.
The national team will play in the Asian 5-nation division1...to target a top 3 slot in Asia and join Japan Hong Kong and Korea as the elite unions on the ARFU platform.
The meaning of life for us, after a massive long season, is to win division 1 and challenge the top tier Sri Lanka needs to invest big and create the professional platform, to compete with the biggest rugby unions. If there is an element of doubt ...consider our fellow island brothers, across the big pond in Fiji, Samoa, Tonga ...proud island warriors with amazing hearts and unions that believe. The Rugby World Cup 2015 clearly showing the incredible potential for island rugby ...not forgetting which amazing islanders are current back to back World champions of our code!
We need research and careful study, to learn and implement, such a blueprint for Sri Lanka rugby, in the next 5 years.
Let's focus on the big glamorous schools fixtures and pure passion ...just typical island rugby hearts that defy description and shift the minds ability to understand sport and its greater appeal
Here is my attempt to share some thought about this years Bradby and what a cracker weekend in Colombo Facts: its the 1st leg ...its also a league match for the 2016 school season.
Royal are the defending champions ...both league and Bradby.
Royal have coach Martis and Lewke his pack coach. Trinity has head coach Eric Miller, Sean Wijeysinghe, Saliya Kumara.
A heavy duty coaching department that leaves very little to chance from glucose. proteinto ground conditions and ice bath recovery. The boys eat, sleep, talk, drink and live rugby ...fully supported by the old boys structured rugby corporations.
The season has lined the match quite neatly ...Trinity dropping their guard against S Thomas in Pallekelleand Royal pretty much a similar result against Thomas' two weeks ago. Last Saturday Royal drew and Trinity lost their unbeaten status ...which means its all down to form on the day.
Royal will rely on their forwards...their powerhouse and will need their backs to step up..become more efficient and finish better. Coach Martis very conscious of these factors will be planning slowing it downthe trademark rolling maul..and lots of territory on Saturday. If that draw against Joes affects them is left to be seen. Royal as a team ...at home, Bradby Shield holders and defending league champions are a handful, only if they believe it fully.
Trinity are retaining many players from last year ...missing their skipper serving a one match suspension for dangerous play ...but they are well drilled and faster as a unit ...with the hunger to get that Bradby back. On paper the backs have enjoyed good ball but will have to feed on whatever they get against Royal. Experts will be dissecting the stats and speculation rife ...!
Channel Eye will broadcast the whole experience live to proud old boys globally on the live stream www.channeleye.lk and locally on Channel Eye islandwide. The Rupavahini app also on download. Thank you Singer Sri Lanka for their investment in belief and our traditions...its the true spirit of sport, and the essence of our lives.
We are all given to limits and acceptable standardsbut the big games need exceptions, need players who simply step up and command respect in the middle.
The mind is the key as we know ...the ability to defy every set principle..to fight when all is lost ..to revive the mind with that last gasp and find some reserve to shock and stun your opposition. Only a few have that special untouchable kryptonite core..to virtually singlehandedly transform for hopeless to magical, on one breath of sheer courage and pace. ...its how big the heart and how much the ability to believe in yourself and rise up to finish If this is so ...the mind. miles stronger. Bula bula Bradby.
Cheers islanders.

Minister refutes drug shortage charges

There is no shortage of drugs in hospitals, assured Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
He said some sections of the media without proper facts had mistakenly reported recently that there was a drug shortage in the country. He challenged any one to provide the facts if there was a drug shortage at hospitals.
The minister made these observations at yesterdays Cabinet press briefing at the Information Department Auditorium.
Dr. Senaratne said the government spends billions of rupees on drugs for the countrys free health service.
Over 1,400 types of drugs are available at hospitals and only 16 types of drugs which are rarely used are in short supply at hospitals.
If there is a shortage of drugs, just point out to us where such a shortage exists and what type of drug is not available, the Minister requested. The other matter is if someone makes baseless allegations about substandard drugs, it is the private sector that stands to benefit.
The quality of drugs at public hospitals are far better than those of private hospitals, he said.
The minister added that measures are also being taken to provide more MRI scanners to the Colombo North and Kalutara Hospitals.
Parliamentary Affairs and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana and Military Spokesman Brigadier Jayantha Jayaweera were also present.

Sri Lanka names 17 players for England: Two uncapped all-rounders in Test squad

Two uncapped all-rounders were named in Sri Lankas 17-member Test squad picked for the tour of England yesterday.
Dhananjaya de Silva a right-hand bat and off-break bowler and Dasun Shanaka, right-hand bat and right-arm medium bowler both aged 24 are the two newcomers to the Test side.
They have both appeared for Sri Lanka in T20 internationals  De Silva in 2 and Shanaka in 10 that includes the recently concluded World T20 in India.
The team lacks experience in batting which will be severely tested in English conditions with skipper Angelo Mathews with 56 Test caps as the most experienced batter. The rest have not played more than 25 Tests.
Sri Lanka who are undergoing are period of transition are due to play a series of three Tests, the first two up in the north of England at Leeds and at Durham where the temperatures can be cold and clammy and the conditions suited for swing and seam bowling. The third and final Test will be played at Lords London.
Sri Lanka has named five fast-medium bowlers headed by experienced Dhammika Prasad in their bowling unit which sees the return of Shaminda Eranga who hasnt played for his country since January 2015 due to a series of injuries that has affected his career.
The two spinners who make up the bowling unit are Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera. There is no place for promising young leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay.
The national selectors have named Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and Kusal Mendis as openers. Silva gains selection after recovering from a blow on the back of his head in a practice match played at Pallekele.
Vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal will be the first choice wicket-keeper with Niroshan Dickwella as his deputy.
The middle order will be manned by Lahiru Thirimanne, Chandimal, Mathews and Milinda Siriwardana and looks pretty insecure in the absence of retired legends Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara.
Tamil Union who emerged Premier league champions for 2015-16 contribute four players to the Test squad  all bowlers.
The team is due to leave for England on May 4 and play two warm-up first-class matches against Essex and Leicestershire before commencing the Test series against England at Leeds on May 19.
Sri Lanka won a Test series for the first time in England (1-0) on their last tour in 2014.

Taylor replaces Malinga in Mumbai Indians IPL team
New Delhi, Wednesday: West Indies fast bowler Jerome Taylor on Wednesday signed for the Mumbai Indians, replacing Lasith Malinga who was ruled out of this season's Indian Premier League (IPL) with a knee injury.
The 31-year-old Taylor will join the Ricky Ponting-coached side for the rest of the Twenty20 tournament after the required paperwork was completed, India's cricket board said in a statement.
The Jamaican played just one match for the West Indies, in the group stages, during the World Twenty20 earlier this month when the Caribbean side clinched the title for the second time, defeating England in the final.
Taylor has played in previous IPL editions, representing the Kings XI Punjab and the former Pune Warriors franchises. Sri Lankan veteran Malinga returned to Colombo after the first three IPL matches without having played in the tournament to recover from the lingering injury that also kept him out of the World T20 held in India.

Why Jacques Kallis is embarrassed to call himself a SAn

NEW DELHI: Former South African cricketer Jacques Kallis has said he is "embarrassed" to call himself South African, following the ban on four of the country's sports federations from hosting or bidding for major tournaments.
The South African government on Tuesday banned its national cricket, rugby, athletics and netball federations from bidding for international tournaments as a result of a failure to increase their number of black players.
"So sad that I find myself embarrassed to call myself a South African so often these days #no place for politics in sport," Kallis, one cricket's finest all-rounders, said.
Kallis' Tweet received a lot of criticism post which it was taken down and he also posted a reply.
"Comment y'day was re political NOT anti Transformation. 40 underprivileged boys had or having education paid for by JK foundation," Kallis posted on Twitter.
According to a report in ESPN Cricinfo, the ban will be reviewed after the next annual report in the 2016-17 cycle and so, South African cricket is unlikely to be seriously affected. - ZMB

England league great Sinfield to retire from all rugby

London, Wednesday: England league great Kevin Sinfield said Wednesday he will retire from all forms of rugby at the end of the current domestic rugby union season in May.
The former Leeds and England rugby league captain, who changed codes to join Rhinos' sister club Yorkshire Carnegie, who play in English rugby union's second-tier Championship, in November and had another 12 months left on his contract.
However, Sinfield told a news conference at Headingley, best known as the joint home of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and Leeds rugby league club, that he would retire after receiving a number of job offers.
"I have been privileged and deeply honoured to have enjoyed a 20-year career as a professional rugby player and to retire on my own terms rather than through injury is something I feel lucky to be able to do," said Sinfield, who turns 36 in September.
"I have always said that some day I will need to get a proper job and that day has now come.
"I have thoroughly enjoyed the last seven months with Yorkshire Carnegie and I would like to thank the coaches, players and supporters for making me feel so welcome.
"I have always given total commitment to every team I have ever played in and, therefore, I have decided to hang up my boots at the end of this season.
"A number of opportunities have become available to me for life after rugby and I need to make the right decision for me and my family.
"However, before then we have got hopefully four massive games ahead of us, starting this Sunday against a very good Doncaster side at Headingley Carnegie."
Sinfield bowed out of the 13-man game after skippering Leeds to a domestic treble.
Yorkshire Carnegie coach Bryan Redpath said: "It has been great to have Kevin involved in our squad this season, especially for the large number of young players we have in our group."
The former Scotland scrum-half added: "He is a total professional and the example he sets is something that all young players can aspire to.
"He is a natural winner and that attitude and drive will be more important than ever for us as we head into the play-offs looking to book our return to the Aviva Premiership."
Carnegie will play local rivals Doncaster in a two-legged semi-final, with the aggregate winners progressing to the two-legged final to contest the right for promotion to the English top-flight.
In 19 seasons in league, Sinfield led Leeds to seven Grand Final victories, back-to-back Challenge Cup triumphs and three World Club Challenge titles. - AFP

Japans Uchiyama flattened as record hopes vanish

Wednesday: Japan's Takashi Uchiyama suffered a shock defeat by Panama's Jezreel Corrales on Wednesday, a brutal second-round knockout dashing his hopes of a 12th defence of his WBA super featherweight title.
The 36-year-old Uchiyama, considered Japan's best pound-for-pound boxer in recent years, had never tasted defeat in his professional career -- until Corrales unleashed a violent flurry of punches to flatter the champion. Uchiyama, who won the belt from Mexican Juan Carlos Salgado in 2010, had been looking to overhaul Yoko Gushiken's Japanese record of 13 title defences between 1976 and 1981. But the Nagasaki-born tough guy, dubbed "Knockout Dynamite" by Japanese fans and media, was sent crashing to the canvas three times in the second round by top-ranked challenger Corrales, who put Uchiyama out of his misery with a vicious left hook.
Corrales entered the ring with a skeleton mask and the fight quickly turned into a horror story for Uchiyama, who was caught flush on the chin by the southpaw early in the first round. - AFP

No one will be able to splinter or divide the SLFP. All SLFPers will firmly stand behind the party leadership during the May Day Rally to be held in Galle, said Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake.
He said the SLFP May Day Rally in Galle will give due recognition to the countrys working class. Ekanayake expressed these views at a press conference at the Central Provincial Council premises recently.
Ekanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has given due recognition to the working class by appointing a working class leader in the calibre of Leslie Devendra as the chairman of the SLFP May Day Rally organising committee.
He said the SLFP would march forward under the leadership of President by weathering all storms. He said President Sirisena had steered the SLFP towards victory as the Party General Secretary for 17 years and had the ability to ensure the partys victory in future too.
