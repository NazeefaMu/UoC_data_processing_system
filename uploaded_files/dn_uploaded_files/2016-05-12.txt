New strategic approach for State Owned Enterprises

The Secretary to the President has issued directives to all State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to prepare their Organizational Results Frameworks (ORFs) with Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), in order to have SEOs achieve expected results and improved productivity.
In order to ensure the achievement of results against the set targets, the Department of Project Management and Monitoring (DPMM) is also assigned to monitor them closely and report periodically on their progress.
Approximately, 307 institutions are currently functioning as SOEs. Following the instructions, 88 of them have prepared ORFs including KPIs so far and will operate according to the guidelines.
However, a large number of SOEs are still in the process of developing their ORFs. DPMM has observed that SOEs need more assistance in preparing ORFs, since this concept is novel to the organisations.
For this reason, the DPMM has already taken initiatives to improve the skills and knowledge of the management of SOEs in preparation of ORFs; Special Training Workshops, Weekly Consultative Clinics and an On-line Help Service.
The management of SOEs and other interested parties are welcome to visit the DPMM website; http://www.pmm.gov.lk for more information and to reserve places for weekly consultative clinics.

Concerted effort to tarnish JHU, former CEB chairman - Warnasinghe

There was an effort by certain parties to tarnish the image of Jathika Hela Urumuya and former CEB chairman Vidya Amarapala, its media spokesman Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said yesterday.
He said that although there was a concerted effort by certain parties to tarnish the image of the JHU and former Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) Chairman Vidya Amarapala over the so called black money scandal revealed in Panama Papers, he had never been involved in such illegal transactions.
Addressing a media briefing at the Party Headquarters, Warnasinghe said the list exposed by some parties and websites in Sri Lanka that includes Amarapalas name does not have any link to Mossack Fonseca or Panama Papers.
He said his name was only included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database along with a list of names of Sri Lankans published in 2013 who had allegedly held accounts or had companies in Singapore but not in the recently released list.
Warnasinghe also noted that even the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), while releasing the names included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database had noted that there are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts. And that they have not intended to suggest or imply that any persons, companies or other entities included in the ICIJ. Offshore Leaks Database has broken the law or otherwise acted improperly.
It was the Ravaya newspaper who carried a news item on Panama Papers revelation which included Amarapalas name along with a set of names of Sri Lankans on 10.04.2016. However, they themselves made an apology on their next issue stating that it wasnt the set list of names included in leaked files from the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseka.
However we decided to hold an inquiry on Amarapala soon after Ravaya news story, as he was a JHU activist. Although we got satisfactory explanations in our inquiry, he himself decided to keep away from all his responsibilities and functions of the ministry and Amarapala tendered his resignation to Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka with the hope that it will be easier if the ministry decides to conduct any investigation into the issue, Warnasinghe said.
Also Minister Ranawaka's Secretary had been directed to lodge a complaint to the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) soon after the Ravaya news story, to inquire whether the SCC had been involved in a financial fraud in any way during 2003-2010 when Amarapala was serving there, which proves that the JHU had acted with transparency regarding this issue.
Addressing the media briefing Vidya Amarapala said that he will take legal action against JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayaka and Muhammad Muzammil of Jathika Nidahas Peramuna for making false allegations during two media conferences held on Tuesday while linking his name to recently revealed Panama Papaers Scandal.
He also noted that the party had allocated 24 hours for them to make a public apology and if they fail to do so he will take a legal action against the two MPs.
We request the government, the Central Bank and the Prime Minister to conduct an investigation regarding the list of names reveled in Panama Papers. However, we also request them to investigate into the set of names included in the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database and to clear away the doubts held by the public, he added.

JVP leader attempting to re-direct the mud thrown at him: Harin

JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was slinging mud at the UNP as a diversionary tactic to escape the mud thrown at him by others, Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He made this observation at a media conference held at Sirikotha yesterday.
Minister Fernando totally refuted the recent allegations made by JVP Leader Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanyake claiming that in the Supplementary Estimate presented by the Government there were allocations of Rs 600 million to purchase VIP
vehicles for the Prime Minister, another Rs 60 million for the renovation of Minister Kabir Hashims Ministry office and another Rs 4.8 million for the renovation of the Telecommunication Ministers official residence.
Minister Fernando said that even the Prime Minister is still unaware that he has ordered two vehicles for his personal use and this request has been made by the Prime Minister Security Division (PMSD) through a procurement committee, since the official vehicle currently used by the Prime Minister is over 10 years old. Therefore, the monthly maintenance charge is over Rs.500,000.
The PMSD has requested two bullet proof vehicles worth Rs 128 million.
But, it is necessary to pay Rs.448 million in tax to the government. This is a tax paid by the government to the government, the minister said.
He further said that Cabinet approval has been granted to allocate Rs.60 million to shift Minister Kabir Hashims Ministry to the World Trade Centre, since a large number of institutions such as banks, the BOI come under his ministry and the WTC is a more convenient place for him to handle all these institutions. But, only Rs.30 million has been spent for this purpose by saving 50 percent of the funds allocated for that.
Minister Fernando also said that according to the governments estimate, it is necessary to have Rs. 2.7 million for the renovation of the official residence of the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure. But, the government has granted only Rs. 4.1 million, he said.
The official residence is a state property and not a personal property of mine.the minister added.
