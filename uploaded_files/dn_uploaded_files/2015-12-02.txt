Commonwealth Games wants cricket back at the crease
Manikata, Tuesday: The Commonwealth Games is in talks with the International Cricket Council about bringing the sport back into the four-yearly event, organisers told AFP.
The Commonwealth Games Federation, which controls the second-biggest multi-sport event after the Olympics, said it was keen to get cricket back on the bill, with the Twenty20 shortest format of the game a particularly "exciting" prospect.
Cricket has only featured once at the Commonwealth Games, at the 1998 event in Kuala Lumpur, but CGF chiefs said their 71 national and territorial associations wanted it back in, provided a viable format could be produced.
"We've had some fantastic conversations with the ICC. It's very much exploratory," CGF chief executive David Grevemberg told AFP at the Commonwealth summit in Malta.
"(It's) one of the priorities of the movement: all 71 nations and territories unanimously agreed that it would be great to have cricket as part of the sports programme.
"It's not out of the question and, working with the ICC, we could come up with a really relevant and exciting format."
At the 1998 Games, 16 teams competed in 50-over matches. Caribbean countries competed separately rather than as West Indies, while a Northern Ireland team also took part. England refused to send a squad as it clashed with the end of the domestic championship season.
South Africa beat Australia in the gold medal match.
Cricket is not on the agenda for the 2018 Games in the Gold Coast, Australia, but could potentially feature at the 2022 Games in Durban, South Africa.
CGF president Louise Martin said West Indies countries such as Jamaica and Barbados would "love" the chance to compete in a global tournament in their own right.
Therefore, "it would be completely different" to existing international cricket tournaments, she told AFP.
"Let's think outside the box and open it up."
She said any Commonwealth Games cricket competition would have to involve countries from each region, and give minor nations worthwhile matches and something to play for.
The format must also be carefully structured also to avoid major teams playing pointless one-sided matches against weaker opposition, the former Scotland swimmer said.
"We need to encourage smaller countries to be able to compete at major Games," she said. However, "you have to look at the whole structure and what the strength in depth is. We don't want whitewashes. I would hate to think that anyone going in against Australia or India are thinking they're going to get nought. That's not what this is about".
She stressed discussions with the ICC were still in the initial phases.
"We'd like to have it back in again. The Twenty20 format makes its so much more exciting and you can do it in a shorter period of time, but at this moment it's still in discussion stage."

GMOA sees minister's personal staff member as stumbling block
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) is always ready to solve issues through discussions as it did in the past with the former Health Minister and current President Maithripala Sirisena but it will not be possible as long as Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne keeps certain persons in his personal staff, GMOA Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath said.
According to Dr. Herath, at the moment there is a specific person in Minister Senaratne's personal staff who had been a member of the GMOA and later sacked from the GMOA for disciplinary reasons.
This person is purposely taking all possible steps to create a conflict between the GMOA and the Health Minister and always prevent GMOA's letters reaching Minister Senaratne, he said. Dr. Hearth pointed out that there was no conflict whatsoever between the GMOA and President Sirisena.
"This was because he was just a phone call away and it was possible to reach him at any time without much hassle. The GMOA did not want to strike because the former Health Minister's personal staff always made arrangements to ensure smooth coordination between the GMOA and the Health Minister," he said. Dr. Herath stressed that during a period of one year, Minister Senaratne gave only two discussions to the GMOA.
"But in the past, the former Health Minister called us for discussions every month and in addition he gave us the chance to meet him at any time to solve urgent issues. The GMOA is an association of professionals who are always willing to solve issues through discussions," he said.

Countering effects of Middle East economic instability
Government to work with IMF
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe instructed Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to work with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a standby programme to face possible impacts on Sri Lankan economy in view of the economic instability in the Middle East region.
The Prime Minister said in Parliament joining the second reading debate on the budget proposal that owing to the activities of the ISIS, there could be an economic instability in the Middle Eastern region which could affect the Sri Lanka economy.
"I instructed the Finance Minister to go for a standby Programme with the IMF to face possible economic instability. Economic growth rates of all countries except for the US have slowed down and Sri Lanka too has felt their effect," the Prime Minister said.
He said the daily income of 43 percent of Sri Lanka's population is less than two US dollars. He said it is essential to help the poor to enjoy the dividends of the economic development.
"We are on the threshold of a new journey. The budget proposals have been designed to facilitate our journey forward. But there are some of those who are not willing to see a change to a new political tradition," he said.
"This unwillingness to change in the minds of some quarters was visible in the reactions when the President presented the policy speech of the government on September 1, when I presented mid-term economic policy on November 5 and when the Finance Minister presented budget proposals on November 20," the Prime Minister said.

The Hindu not published for first time since 1878
One of India's oldest newspapers has not been printed for the first time in 137 years due to rains and floods in the southern Indian city of Chennai.

The Hindu, published daily since 1878, did not come out on Wednesday as workers could not access the press.
The paper's publisher N Murali told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that it was the first time this had happened.
The rains have suspended flights and trains and hundreds of people are without power.

"Our Maraimalainagar township was not accessible for the people who run the plant. So, none of our staff could reach the plant. It is located about 30kms (18 miles) from the city in Maraimalainagar," Mr Murali said.

"The printing press plant is large so we put it up outside the city. Even if we had printed the paper, I doubt if it could have been distributed in the city," he added. Other city newspapers like the Times of India, the Deccan Chronicle and the New Indian Express were printed, although it is unclear if they had reached readers in the city.

The army has been deployed to rescue thousands of stranded people after two days of heavy rains. Flights from the city's airport have been indefinitely suspended after flood waters entered the runway and tarmac areas on Tuesday evening.
Most of the main streets are waterlogged and schools were have been for the 17th day since November, reports say.
Schools and colleges have been shut in six districts due to the rains. (BBC)

ICC admits umpire Llong made DRS error
The ICC has admitted that third umpire Nigel Llong made "an incorrect judgement" while using technology to decide on New Zealand's review of the appeal for catch against Nathan Lyon, which had been given not out on the field on the second day of the day-night Test in Adelaide.
"ICC has reviewed the decision and acknowledged that it was incorrect," it said on Twitter, adding that it had replied to New Zealand Cricket's questioning of the decision. "ICC confirms the umpire followed the correct protocol, but made an incorrect judgement."
The decision was hotly debated and criticised by television commentators and the media at the time, and drew unhappy but guarded reactions from New Zealand players Ross Taylor and Brendon McCullum, and the coach Mike Hesson because it had a significant impact on the Test.
Australia were 8 for 118 in reply to New Zealand's 202 on the second day when Lyon top-edged an attempted sweep off left-arm spinner Mitchell Santner into his shoulder and up to slip. New Zealand's appeal was denied on field by umpire S Ravi, and McCullum asked for a review.
After five minutes of replays, Llong upheld Ravi's decision though there was a clear Hot Spot on the top edge of Lyon's bat, and the batsman had walked halfway to the dressing room. There also seemed to be a deviation in the ball's course, but nothing showed up on Snicko, which also failed to read the impact of the ball on Lyon's shoulder.
Lyon had not scored at the time of his reprieve, and he eventually went on to make 34. Australia's last two wickets added 108 runs in all, and earned a first-innings lead of 22. New Zealand were dismissed for 208 in their second innings, and Australia chased down the target of 187 with only three wickets in hand.

Members of the Inter University Students' Federation (IUSF) lodged a complaint with the IGP yesterday noon in connection with the death of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, IUSF convener Lahiru Weerasekara said.
Weerasekara said copies of the complaint were handed over to the Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry and the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). "The main reason for lodging the complaint is the issue connected to some of the doctors who treated the Thera. These doctors did not have the SLMC registration to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka. They have not renewed their registrations which should be renewed every five years," he said.
These doctors are Sri Lankans and practicing as doctors in other private health institutions. This may pose a great danger to the other patients obtaining treatment from them, Weerasekara added.

Jeewanthi played key role in Central Province's success
When Central Province Ladies team won the women's hockey title at this year's National Sports Festival organised by the Ministry of Sports there was one player who player a silent but major role in them winning the championship for the 25th time, it was their goal keeper amiable Jeewanthi Keerthiratne. She did not allow a single goal to go past her while her forwards contributed 31 goals.
Twenty seven year old Jeewanthi Keerthiratne is at present Sri Lanka's number one goal keeper and the closest challengers to her are two school girls Bhaygya Kidituwakku of Sangamittha Balike Vidyalaya, Matale and Sakuntala Illeperuma of Seetha Devi Girls College. But Jeewanthi is still streets ahead of them and has been Sri Lanka's number one for the last seven years.
What makes her tick Speaking to this writer in a very friendly manner she said that goal keeper's duty is to stop the ball sounding the boards. No acrobatic stunts or showmanship is necessary. You have a good look for the ball from the time it is little outside the semi circle and be in readiness to stop it.
Have your eyes on the striker whose reflexes will give an indication where she is aiming and stop it. You will have to move in the direction of the ball and position yourself and this will confuse the striker looking for an option and a little delay will allow the defenders to crowd round her and making things a little more difficult for her.
Manning the fortress is no easy task and the hard work done by the forwards will be in vain if you concede goals very specially in a closely contested match.
This was evidenced in this year's inter district finals between Kandy and Matale when the former was leading 1-0 for most part of the game. In the second half Jeewanthi did not allows anything to go past her and Kandy scored two goals to win the match 2-1, Many do not analyze this. To save a shot from close range could be very difficult and often dangerous but you should know how to handle it. It is here Jeewanthi is shoulders above the rest.
Jeewanthi Keerthiratne is from the village of Kiribathkumbura off Peradeniya where the only thing of some interest is the Highway Museum where on display is the old equipment from the old vintage used for the construction of Colombo - Kandy Highway under the guidance of Captain Dawson. There is also the specimen of the Bogoda Wooden bridge.
When asked why are goal keeper's stockily built she smiled and replied "I don't about others but my family is on the brawny side.
When I was around 10 years my school Seetha Devi Girls College was just making its presence felt in the schools hockey scene breaking the domination by two other schools in Kandy. My guru M. A. M. Ashroff spotted me and wanted me to come fro practices.
He said that I should, keep goal though at first wanted to be in the thick of play. I played for the school in all age group levels including a three year stint in the under 19 team before saying good bye to school life in 2007.
I played for the Sri Lanka Schools and was vice captain of the side which won the Singapore sixes in 2007. She also played for the Central Province schools team for three years.
In 2007 she joined the Sri Lanka Navy and played for the Defences Services which team she captained in 2013. She led Navy to win the Seetha Devi Sevens in 2011. She also led Navy to win the defence Services Title.
Some of her achievements in the international scene.
Was a member of the Sri Lanka womens team which won the Singapore Sixes in 2012 and 2013 and runners up in 2010. In 2013 when Sri Lanka finished runner up in the Asian Games qualifier held in Thailand which brought her a Silver medal.
Jeewanthi Keerthiratne says she is presently a member of the Sri Lanka Navy team which won the women's hockey nationals and the Seetha Devi Sevens this year and feels that she has few more years of hockey left in her. She is very agile between the posts and her physical movement supported by stick work is a treat to watch.
It is only the connoisseur of hockey who watch and digest her skills. To be Sri Lanka's number one for 8 years is great achievement.

Lomu laid to rest at private family funeral
Auckland, Tuesday: After sharing their grief with an entire nation for almost two weeks, All Black Jonah Lomu's family said their last goodbyes at a private funeral for the rugby legend in Auckland on Tuesday.
The Mormon ceremony was held at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' in Mangere, the gritty south Auckland suburb where Lomu grew up.
His wife Nadene, flanked by sons Brayley, 6, and Dhyreille, 5, addressed mourners from an altar surrounded by pale roses.
The boys wore black shirts with the winger's number 11, the position their father revolutionised on his way to becoming rugby's first global superstar.
The low-key event on Tuesday was in contrast to the scenes of public grief less than 24 hours earlier, when thousands of fans attended a memorial at Eden Park, the spiritual home of New Zealand rugby.
There was also a memorial for the Pacific community to remember Lomu, who had Tongan roots, last Saturday, but Tuesday's funeral was a chance for extended family to say goodbye.
"It's bringing to the end a great celebration, the final stage of the journey for Jonah and his family," said former All Blacks coach John Hart, who has been acting as a spokesman for relatives since Lomu's shock death on November 18.
Since Lomu died tributes have poured in from across the rugby world, with many current players recalling how he inspired them to take up the game.
Such was his fame that condolences also came from beyond the sport, including Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, British footballer David Beckham, Hollywood star Morgan Freeman and singer Elton John.

Left-arm leg-spinners Malshan Rodrigo and Harin Cooray have propelled St Joseph's to four outright victories giving them a flying start in the current inter-school cricket season.
The Josephians led by Sandaruwan Rodrigo recorded outright victories over Mahanama, Maris Stella, De Mazenod and Mahinda College, Galle. Their encounter with Royal Panadura was washed off on the second day while the game against D S Senanayake (first innings win) and Thurstan (first innings loss) ended in no-decisions.
St Joseph's are currently heading their respective group in the Singer All-Island Under 19 tournament (Played 5, Won outright 3, Won first innings 1, No decision 1). Royal, Prince of Wales and Zahira are the three remaining tournament games for the Josephians.
All-rounder Malshan Rodrigo has been their star performer to-date claiming 41 wickets in the seven games inclusive of a match bag of 11 for 87 against De Mazenod. Harin Cooray is not far behind claiming 24 wickets in five games inclusive of a match bag of 9/43 against D S Senanayake.
The successful performance of the Josephians this season has been noteworthy since they have been minus some of their key senior players for most of the games.
All-rounder Jehan Daniel who has been part of the Sri Lanka Under 19 team missed out five games while vice-captain Kevin Cortling fractured his right wrist and missed four games. Their second highest wicket taker Harin Cooray was also sidelined for two games. This year the Darley Road school is coached by Asela Pathirana.

Modi pulls up rich nations on climate change
FRANCE: In a blunt warning to rich nations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday told developed countries which powered their way to prosperity on fossil fuels that it would be "morally wrong" if they shift the burden of reducing emissions on developing countries like India.
"The principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should be the bedrock of our collective enterprise. Anything else would be morally wrong," he wrote in the Opinion section of today's Financial Times.
He asked the developed nations to fulfil their duty to shoulder the greater burden of the fight against climate change.
In the article in the UK's leading financial daily, timed to coincide with the launch of COP 21 conference on climate change here, Modi said, "Some say advanced countries powered their way to prosperity on fossil fuel when humanity was unaware of its impact."
"Since science has moved on and alternative energy sources are available, they argue that those just beginning their development journey bear no less responsibility than those who have reached the zenith of their progress. New awareness, however, should lead advanced countries to assume more responsibility. Just because technology exists does not mean it is affordable and accessible."
"Justice demands that, with what little carbon we can still safely burn, developing countries are allowed to grow. The lifestyles of a few must not crowd out opportunities for the many still on the first steps of the development ladder," he added.
Modi reiterated his plans to launch an alliance of 121 solar-rich nations in the tropics aimed at bringing affordable solar power to villages that are off the grid.
"We expect the same from the world with respect to responding to climate change," he said.
Modi along with nearly 150 world leaders world leaders are here to attend the opening of the climate summit with a central aim of the new agreement to keep global warming below 2C over pre-industrial temperatures.
Modi, with a reference to Mahatma Gandhi, said, "We look forward to Paris with the sense of duty that Mahatma Gandhi called us to assume: We should act as trustees' and use natural resources wisely as it is our moral responsibility to ensure that we bequeath to future generations a healthy planet. India will do its part for success in Paris.
"His assertion came days after US Secretary of State John Kerry said India could be a "challenge" at upcoming climate change talks in Paris beginning November 30 as it "has been more cautious, a little more restrained in its embrace of this new paradigm".

New Zealand name 12-member squad for Sri Lanka Tests
New Zealand retained the out-of-form duo of Martin Guptill and Mark Craig as they pruned their Test squad from 16 to 12 for the two-match home series against Sri Lanka that begins on December 10.
Opening the batting on their just-concluded tour of Australia, Guptill made a highest score of 23 in his six Test innings, while the offspinner Craig picked up eight wickets at an average of 64.12 while conceding more than five runs an over.
Out of the squad that toured Australia, New Zealand left out fast bowlers Matt Henry and Mitchell McClenaghan, back-up wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi and back-up opener Hamish Rutherford. Allrounders Corey Anderson and James Neesham, who are both nursing back injuries, were not available for selection.
"Mark and Martin didn't perform to the level they would have liked over in Australia, but both have shown in the past what they're capable of and we're confident they'll make valuable contributions in the upcoming series," New Zealand coach Mike Hesson said.
Left-arm seamer Neil Wagner and allrounder Mitchell Santner, who made his debut during the day-night Test in Adelaide, also kept their places in the squad. Wagner didn't play any of the Tests in Australia, but picked-up a five-wicket haul in a tour game against a Western Australia XI.
"The level of composure Mitchell showed on debut was very impressive and he certainly displayed how exciting a player he is with both the bat and ball," Hesson said. "His ability to bat in the top six and bowl good overs gives us options and assists the team balance. We're looking forward to watching Mitchell's continued development. Neil impressed in Australia and not only showed that he'll run in hard all day, but was swinging the ball again."
Wagner has also been included in the New Zealand Board President's XI, which will take on the Sri Lankans in a three-day warm-up match that begins on December 3.
Test squad:
Brendon McCullum (captain), Trent Boult, Doug Bracewell, Mark Craig, Martin Guptill, Tom Latham, Mitchell Santner, Tim Southee, Ross Taylor, Neil Wagner, BJ Watling, Kane Williamson
President's XI:
Ryan McCone (captain), James Baker, Joe Carter, Joel Harden, Shawn Hicks, Tim Johnston, Ken McClure, Matt McEwan, Glenn Phillips, Bharat Popli, Ben Smith, Blair Tickner, Neil Wagner.

Obama eyes overhaul of criminal justice system
US: President Barack Obama is making a hard case for overhauling the U.S. criminal justice system, but where he stands on the death penalty is unclear.
Obama has hinted that his support for capital punishment is eroding, but he has refused to discuss what he might call for.
A Justice Department review has dragged on for 18 months with little mention or momentum. The president recently repeated he is "deeply concerned" about the death penalty's implementation, though he also acknowledges the issue has not been a top priority.
"I have not traditionally been opposed to the death penalty in theory, but in practice it's deeply troubling," Obama told the Marshall Project, a nonprofit journalism group, citing racial bias, wrongful convictions and questions about "gruesome and clumsy" executions.
His delay in proposing solutions, he said, is because "I got a whole lot of other things to do as well."
Obama said he plans to weigh in, and considers the issue part of his larger, legacy-minded push for an overhaul of the criminal justice system.
White House officials say the president is looking for an appropriate response and wading through the legal ramifications.
Capital prosecutions are down across the United States. A shortage of lethal injection drugs has meant de facto freezes in several states and at the federal level. Spurred in part by encouragement from Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, advocates are debating whether the time is right to push the court to take a fresh look at whether the death penalty is constitutional.
A solid majority - 61 percent - of the public supports the death penalty in murder cases, but that share has crept downward while opposition has inched up, according to a Gallup poll last month. Obama isn't alone in struggling with the issue.
"We have a lot of evidence now that the death penalty has been too frequently applied and, very unfortunately, often times in a discriminatory way," Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said.
"So I think we have to take a hard look at it." She also said she does "not favour abolishing" it in all cases. - JAPAN TIMES

Motion to formulate new constitution - PM
The government is planning to move a motion to formulate a new constitution, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He said the government will move a motion to convert Parliament to a Constitutional Council in formulation of the new constitution as pledged during the election.
He made these observations joining the second reading debate of the budget proposals.
The Prime Minister said the government has to bring new laws to create a new political culture.
He said the government takes measures to set up Parliamentary Supervisory Committees to act as a government. He said 16 more supervisory committees are to be set up in addition to the PAC and the COPE. MPs will chair each of the committees. All ministries will come under them, he said. "The National Audit Act, Right to Information Act will be presented to Parliament soon", the Prime Minister said.
"The amendments to increase women's representation to 25 percent at the Local Government Institutions have been formulated," he said. A strong institution will be set up in connection with anti-corruption activities. A Development Co-ordinating Board will be set up to coordinate development activities in the country while steps would be taken to set up Gramarajya centres, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Budget provides concessions for the needy - Rajitha
The budget 2016 is a golden budget which provided concessions for the needy, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne told in Parliament yesterday.
He was joining the second reading debate on the budget proposals for the eighth allotted day.
"Though Sri Lanka achieved the average growth rate of about 6.5 percent during the past few years, many districts, including Mannar, Mullaitivu, Killinochchi, Batticaloa, Badulla, Monaragala and Ratnapura have the higher poverty level than the national average. The daily income of most of these families is lower than two dollars," the minister said.
When the new government was formed, country's income was low and the debt burden was high. Sri Lanka has the lowest tax income in the Asian region. The previous government had shown the people false data, he said.
The government has spent Rs.130 billion to increase the salaries of public servants. Relief was provided for the needy by reducing the prices of 11 essential food items, the minister said.
The government has provided relief for farmers by providing fertilizer subsidy.
Minister Senaratne proposed Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to grant Rs. one million to doctors on behalf of the vehicle permit received earlier. Minister Karunanayake accepted the proposal.
MR signals budget's success - Sagala
The best assessment of the budget has been given by former President and Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa who has not spoken during the budget debate, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake told Parliament yesterday.
"The former President has not signed the no-confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake. We expect that the
former President would express his comments on the budget soon," he said.
The minister was participating in the debate of the second reading of budget 2016.
"The world attention is on Sri Lanka as a result of the January eight revolution. Many countries which opposed Sri Lanka earlier are
helping the country. Our aim is to strengthen the economy through international trade. We will get the GSP+ facility shortly which will open the EU market for our products. Both main parties have reached the consensus on developing country and strengthening the economy. Many youth left the country those days as there were no jobs for their qualifications. Today, we have created an environment conducive to make strong, intelligent and skilled youth," the minister said.
Those who had left the country seeking employment opportunities are returning to Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe does not take popular decisions. He always stood his principals. He thinks about the future and takes strong decisions, Minister Ratnayake said.
Meanwhile, UPFA MP Mahindananda Alutgamage said that he is against the budget as it affects the poor.
"The budget has not provided relief for the people. We can not go to our villages if we vote for the budget. The budget does not contain President Maithripala Sirisena's ideas and policies. It is based on the Prime Minister's ideas. This is a deal based budget," he said.
"Although, the President raises his views on protecting the environment, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake imposed the taxes on electric cars. A brother-in-law of one of the ministers has obtained a majority of shares of a major vehicle importing company. That is why tax on electric cars was raised to give an advantage to the importer. I request the Prime Minister to probe the matter of providing 50 gold import permits to cronies of the government," Alutgamage said.
Meanwhile, Public Administration and Management Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said the budget has been presented to lay the foundation for a strong economy. The government will address the grievances of the public servants. A housing programme will be started for them, he said.
Rural Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said both government and the opposition members are pointing out shortcomings of the budget. That shows that democracy is prevailing in the country, he said.
Mahindananda lauds Prime Minister
Opposition Parliamentarian Mahindananda Alutgamage lauded Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's leadership quality of being a good listener in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation when government backbenchers were shouting during his speech joining the second reading debate on the budget yesterday. He said backbenchers should learn from the leader to listen first.
However, Alutgamage said those who had worked tirelessly spending their monies and time to save the UNP when the party was in the opposition could not yield the results when they formed the government. Daya Gamage was the one who paid electricity and water bills of Sirikotha when the UNP was in the opposition. His lands too had been taken away from him, Alutgamage said.
"He has not been given a ministry which helps him to get his lands back," he said.
Minister Daya Gamage said he was Primary Industries Minister and had nothing to do with lands.
"I paid the electricity bills of Sirikotha. I am the one who settled the bills," the Prime Minister said.
'PMB lost Rs. 1,735 million last year'
The Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) lost Rs. 1,735 million last year without receiving rice from paddy given to private rice mill owners for processing, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P.Harrison told in parliament yesterday.
The minister said investigations have been started by the Criminal Investigation Department to find out reasons for not receiving rice from paddy provided for 30 private rice mill owners. He said measures have been taken by the government to protect small and medium scale rice mill owners.
Loan facilities provided to the rice mill owners by the previous regime had been misused. Investigations have been started to look into this. He said the present government has also provided loans to them. They use these loans for other purposes," he said.
He said measures will be taken to provide Rs. 10 billion to the Treasury by strengthening rice mill owners avoiding unnecessary expenses.
Budget includes holistic approach to development - Swaminathan
The budget 2016 has covered the business community, development community, the public, low and middle income groups, women and children, vulnerable, senior citizens, public officers and all concerned stakeholders, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M.Swaminathan said in parliament yesterday.
"It is not easy to cover all parties who have conflict of interest. I consider this budget as a 'development oriented people friendly' budget which covers the aspirations of all Sri Lankans. This budget will be a milestone to create an upper middle income economy with inclusive growth and development. Rome was not built in a day," the minister said.
A delicate balance is maintained between economic reforms and price reduction of essential goods to provide relief to the masses," he said participating in the second reading stage debate on budget proposals.
The minister said unexpected costs from contracts signed by the previous government had restricted the space available to the government to manage resources efficiently.
The government has introduced a budgeting system which helps to rationalise public expenditure based on relevance and justification. Under the previous regime, 60 to 70 percent of the budget was at discretion of a few family members. Public assets were misused and given to friends and relatives, he said.
"We inherited a crisis ridden economy. It is not easy to revive the economy which had been mismanaged for the last 10 years. The 2016 budget is both development oriented and relief centred. This implies that the main thrust of the budget is two-fold. It includes cost of living reduction and pushing the development agenda," he said.
"According to the Fitch rating, the budget proposals reiterates ambitious set of economic reforms aimed at raising foreign investment, boosting private sector participation in the economy, promoting public-private partnerships, reducing dependency in foreign borrowings, improving ease-of-doing business and ensuring governance standards to achieve inclusive growth, employment generation, shared prosperity and protecting the poor and the vulnerable," the minister said.
Public investment has focused on infrastructure development, health, education and human capital development. The budget not only helps to revive the crisis driven economy but also includes proposals to achieve people friendly inclusive development, Minister Swaminathan said.
Budget based on erroneous hypothesis - Dinesh
The budget is based on an erroneous hypothesis, MP Dinesh Gunawardane told in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation joining the debate on the budget proposals for the eighth allotted day.
Gunawardane said notes worth Rs.300 million have been minted by the government. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said the Rs. 300 million was used to pay loans taken during the Rajapaksa regime.
Gunawardana said the government expects an overnight industrialization. There should be proper plans to achieve industrialization, he said.
Gunawardana said the government has a plan to reduce 11,000 workers from the SLTB.

Ranjan goes to Bribery Commission again; lodges complaint against Kumara Welgama
Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake accompanied by Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe lodged a complaint with the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption against former Transport Minister Kumara Welgama.
This complaint has been based on a large scale financial fraud which had occurred in the importation of buses for the Ceylon Transport Board (CTB) during 2013-2014.
According to Ramanayake, the former minister has defrauded Rs. 2,860 million from 2,200 buses.
Accordingly Welgama has benefited by USD 10,000 from each bus. "Though they have imported 2200 buses, Cabinet approval had been granted to import only 1,500. They had imported 700 buses without Cabinet approval. They have paid USD 50,000 for a bus, but the correct price is only USD 40,000," he said.
The deputy minister was speaking to the media after arriving at the Bribery Commission yesterday to lodge a complaint and to inquire into the fate of the complaints he had lodged previously.
"We have no any personal issue with former Minister Kumara Welgama or others who held ministerial posts during the previous regime. But we need to take legal action against those who played out public money," Ramanayake said.
He also charged that there was only one company which had permission to import vehicle spare parts and it is said to be owned by a relative or friend of Welgama.
All details in this regard will be revealed at the investigations, the deputy ministers said.
Deputy Transport Minister Abeysinghe said that the bus fare will never be increased as demanded by several private bus organisations.
He said that the ministry has called for tenders to purchase 10 new train engines, 15 power sets and 160 train compartments and all of these are done in a transparent manner.

Reptile fossil explains how snakes lost their legs
UK: When and how did snakes lose their limbs A fresh analysis of a reptile fossil is helping scientists solve this evolutionary puzzle.
A 90 million-year-old skull is giving researchers vital clues about how snakes evolved. Comparisons between CT scans of the fossil and modern reptiles indicate that snakes lost their legs when their ancestors evolved to live and hunt in burrows, which many snakes still do today.
"How snakes lost their legs has long been a mystery to scientists, but it seems that this happened when their ancestors became adept at burrowing," said lead researcher Hongyu Yi from University of Edinburgh.
The findings show snakes did not lose their limbs in order to live in the sea, as was previously suggested.
Scientists used CT scans to examine the bony inner ear of Dinilysia patagonica, a 2-metre long reptile closely linked to modern snakes.
These bony canals and cavities, like those in the ears of modern burrowing snakes, controlled its hearing and balance. They built 3D virtual models to compare the inner ears of the fossils with those of modern lizards and snakes.
Researchers found a distinctive structure within the inner ear of animals that actively burrow, which may help them detect prey and predators.
This shape was not present in modern snakes that live in water or above ground.
The findings help scientists fill gaps in the story of snake evolution, and confirm Dinilysia patagonica as the largest burrowing snake ever known.
They also offer clues about a hypothetical ancestral species from which all modern snakes descended, which was likely a burrower.

Rs. 397 b loss last year due to vehicle congestion - Patali
The country incurred a Rs. 397 billion loss last year on account of the massive vehicle congestion in Colombo and its suburbs. Due to this congestion, the vehicle speed in the city had dropped from 20 kmph to 12 kmph, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. "A Megapolis Development Authority will be set up by an Act of Parliament in January next year for the development of the Western Province and major cities in the country. This will be in addition to the Western Megapolis Authority set up to develop the Western Province," the minister said.
Ranawaka was addressing a seminar at the SLFI, Colombo on Monday to obtain public ideas and views on the proposed Western Province and megapolis development projects to be undertaken by his ministry.
The minister said the powers and the duties of the Urban Development Authority would be vested in the Western Megapolis Development Authority in addition to some additional powers to enable it to carry out its duties efficiently and systematically.
Ranawaka said megapolis and other massive development projects would be completed by 2030 in three stages.
"When one considered the Western Province, it had more than 100,000 slum dwellers. The Megapolis Development Project would find a solution to the slum problem by taking public views into consideration," he said.
The minister said the megapolis development plan formulated with local and foreign expertise would be changed every five years in keeping with changing times and needs.
He said speedy urbanisation has caused traffic congestion and a garbage problem, developing into a major economic problem.
"Three decades ago, only 132,000 vehicles entered the Colombo City daily but it had increased to nearly 500,000 today.
Of them, only 15 percent accounted for public transport while the other 85 percent included motorcycles, three wheelers, cars and vans," the minister said.
He said the new national identity card to be issued shortly would have technical features enabling it to be used as a credit card, passport or a bus fare payment card.

Runaway loss of Antartica ice may last for centuries
NEW ZEALAND: The runaway loss of ice from Antarctica as a result of global climate change could last for centuries, said a study on Friday.
The Victoria University-led researchers studied rocks at different elevations beside the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) and found that a period of rapid glacier thinning occurred in the recent geological past and persisted for several centuries, Xinhua reported.
Parts of the Antarctic ice sheet were at risk of "marine ice sheet instability", where an initial retreat of ice margins into deepening valleys could lead to continued, unstable ice loss.
Lead researcher Richard Jones said the processes leading to instability could be initiated by just minor climate warming.
"The finding is very important for predicting Antarctica's future contribution to sea level change -- particularly when considering that the EAIS contains enough vulnerable ice to raise sea level by tens of metres," Jones said in a statement.
"It might only require a small amount of climate variation to initiate runaway ice loss, and it could continue for centuries to millennia."
The process had been suggested for many years, but the study presented the first directly recorded evidence that it had taken place in the past, providing new insight into the future behaviour of rapidly changing parts of Antarctica.

South Korea trains young hackers
SOUTH KOREA: In a darkened "war room" dozens of South Korea's brightest college students are practicing hacking each other as part of a government programme to train them to battle some of the world's best - the shadowy techno-soldiers of Kim Jong Un's regime.
To build its defenses, President Park Geun-hye's government has enlisted 120 of the country's most-talented young programmers, offering full scholarships in return for seven years of military service. While the hackers of the Kim regime may be best known for their link to last year's attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., their primary target remains South Korea, with the two countries technically still at war more than 60 years after the conflict that sealed their division.
The urgency to train "white," or ethical, hackers is rising as industrialized nations try to safeguard digital information vital to national security and infrastructure, while combating cybercrime that is estimated to cost over $400 billion a year globally. South Korea's experience fending off the North has made the country a global player in cyberdefense. Mitigating future damage still remains a challenge for Seoul's military hackers as the North's attacks become more sophisticated.
"There are many nations that seek to benchmark us and our systems, particularly because my country is squaring off with North Korea," South Korea's technology minister, Choi Yang-hee, said in his office south of Seoul. "So we're constantly cooperating at the global level."
Choi's ministry funds additional training for some of the students who receive the scholarships to Korea University's national cyberdefense department, which will produce its first batch of graduates next year.
The college programme is part of a broader build-up. The government is doubling the size of its cybercommand to 1,000 people and raised spending on information security by almost 50 percent to 250 billion won ($218 million) between 2009 and 2015. But the South is playing catch-up.
North Korea began to train its cyberwarriors while developing nuclear arms in the early 1990s and now commands 1,700 "highly skilled and specialized hackers," Cho Hyun-chun, chief of South Korea's Defense Security Command, said at a forum in Seoul in July, calling North Korea a "global cyberpower."
Pyongyang's elite unit was set up to focus on attacking military, economic and other key facilities in the event of war, said Kim Heung-kwang, who taught computer science at a university in North Korea before he defected.
"North Korea raised hackers as an asymmetrical threat against South Korea that showed its Achilles heel in cyberwarfare," Kim said. "Hackers were a cost-effective way to neuter South Korea's key facilities in the event of war."
The North's prowess took the South by surprise, and in 2009 a suspected North Korean cyberattack paralyzed U.S. and South Korean government websites, prompting South Korea to set up a cyberdefense command the following year.
