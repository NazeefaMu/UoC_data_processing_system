Speed up healing process
City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem says that the recent incidents in Kandy and Ampara were not Sinhala-Muslim riots but purely mob attacks that targeted the Muslim community. In an interview with The Hindu the Minister opined that the incendiary atmosphere was brewing since the culmination of the war and waiting to explode any time soon.The sizable victory achieved by the Joint Opposition at the recent local government election lit the fuse of the ticking time bomb, since the ethnic polarization become pronounced by the victory of the nationalist forces.
We cannot rule out the possibility of some type of political motivation. This is endemic to our culture, the minister went on to state. He said; On the one side this has been a local manifestation of an international problem- Islamophobia. It has intensified due to very deliberate actions of certain xenophobic forces that have mobilized themselves intensely, particularly after the war victory, looking for another enemy. They look for pretexts to attack Muslims and target their economy and livelihoods. Their deliberate attempts have had a fair share of political patronage.
Minister Hakeem, certainly, is certainly pained by the plight of his community.There is also some truth in his claim that there is today a wide prevalence of anti-Muslim sentiment. Kandy, particularly has always been vulnerable to anti-Muslim flare-ups, dotted as it is with large pockets of Muslims. It only needs a spark to ignite the flames.
It was his electorate, Hewaheta, in Kandy, that witnessed the black episode of the Udathalawinna massacre, where some dozen Muslim youth were killed on the day of the 2001 General Election, by mobs, allegedly unleashed by the son of a powerful minister. On that occasion too Minister Hakeem cried out for justice for the victims, in an impassioned speech in parliament. However, no one was brought to book and the matter was laid to rest with the passage of time. It may have been only coincidental that today the finger is being pointed at the same elements, for the mayhem in Kandy. Going by this premise the minister may be right in his assessment that Muslims have been singled out for attacks, even though the Udathalawinna incident occurred long before the conclusion of the war, or prior to the current wave of Islamophobia. The Kandy incidents had only gone to confirm the vulnerability of his community, which has only intensified today following the pohottuwa victory at the LG polls.
The Minister also has certainly hit the nail on the head when he says that the Kandy and Ampara incidents were not communal violence but mob attacks on the Muslims, just as Black July was not communal violence between the Tamils and Sinhalese but organised mob attacks on the Tamil community. Had the Kandy incidents took the form of a communal clash there would have been two way traffic, with the Muslims too retaliating in kind. But here, as in the case of the July 83 riots, it was the minority community, alone, who was at the receiving end of the mob violence, which even made Minister Laskhman Kiriella to demand that the Sinhalese apologize to the Muslims, sentiments that were not well received by sections of the Buddhist clergy.
The Minister is also not far off the mark in his assessment of the genesis of the problem. The sweeping anti-Muslim wave in the West, with the emergence of a plethora of Jihadists groups, is certainly having its knock down effect in countries like Sri Lanka. Some Muslim politicians too have not helped matters by their actions. The large scale clearing of the Wilpattu jungles for the purpose of re-settling war displaced Muslims, the construction of Mosques in the East in disputed land etc. have naturally caused resentment among the majority community. On the other side of the coin, monks going on the rampage spewing venom, and spreading unsubstantiated allegations concerning attempts to diminish the Sinhala race has made the Muslims an object of hate. The authorities should act urgently remove the causes that has made both communities look askance at each other.
The urgent need now is to speed up the healing process where all misunderstanding will be sorted out, for both communities to resume their historical bonds that go back to the times of the Sinhala kings. Only a very few misguides elements were responsible for the Kandy incidents but the Sinhala people in general work and move closely with the Muslim community. The gesture by most, including the Buddhist clergy, who rallied to help out the Kandy victims, the rebuilding of a Muslim shop, destroyed in Anamaduwa, by the Sinhala villagers, itself goes to demonstrate that by and large the Sinhalese don't harbour any enmity towards their Muslim brethren.
Now that the investigations are being carried out in earnest and the culprits identified, what is of vital importance is to leave no room for the spectre of communal strife, of the kind witnessed in Kandy, to resurface in any form. All vestiges of suspicion and misunderstanding should also be put to rest by both parties so that no side entertain any fear or doubt about each other.

Stafford International School:
Stage set for emerging talent
From the tale that captivated romance lovers throughout the world, to a little girls strange journey into a rabbit hole, to the vengeance of a magical minstrel, drama comes alive in its most wondrous forms when the Stafford International school thespians step on stage. Dramatic Moves features Stafford International School Drama Club that can bring to life the very best of literature.
For Teacher in Charge of Stafford International School Drama Club, Leelamani Haththotuwegama drama has been an important part of her life since her childhood. In her family drama was something to be encouraged and has really benefited her life.
Drama sort of runs in my family. My siblings were very interested in drama. Our home was like a theatre and my father used to work in Colombo and came home for the weekends. We used to practice a play and perform for him.
That interest in drama was nurtured in us and most of us are literature teachers including myself. Some of the dramas I have produced are extracts of texts I teach students, said Haththotuwegama.
In addition to teaching Pride and Prejudice, which is one of the best novels on romance, she also taught other Jane Austen novels such as Emma and Persuasion. Pride and Prejudice is of course the masterpiece by Jane Austen which narrates the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy in a way that evokes strong emotions and makes it unforgettable.
I have been teaching at Stafford for 13 years now, and for about 11 of those years, I have been producing and directing dramas for the school. One of my dramas, an extract from Hamlet was performed for a competition conducted by Trinity College London and Cambridge University. That won a merit award. Doing drama with these students is very entertaining although it is hard work. On many occasions practices have gone on till late in the night, she said.
Some weekends, I got them to come at around 8am and we practiced till six or seven in the evening. It was physically strenuous but exhilarating and enjoyable.
The students loved it. Drama needs a lot of discipline and punctuality. I give them one week to memorize the scripts. Janani Vithanage and I wrote the script for Pride and Prejudice.
It was a great opportunity for the students to do a live performance of a text they are studying. I got a good response from the audiences and from the school authorities on the productions. We had a fine Stage Manager, Javin Thomas and teacher Mahesha helped me with the costumes, explained Haththotuwegama.
At Stafford, drama is an important extra-curricular activity and the school authorities give their full patronage and support. Drama workshops are conducted on a weekly basis at present by Bimsara Premarathne.
Giovanni Fernando played the character of the affable, friendly, bubbly and extroverted Mr. Bingley, one of the main characters in Pride and Prejudice.
When you do drama, you become more like the character you are playing. I played the role of Mr. Bingley in Pride and Prejudice. I tend to have his characteristics so it became somewhat natural for me. There are many characteristics you develop through drama, which you notice over time. So when people point it out to me I instantly recall the play. For example when I have prefect duty, I sometimes, without realizing, walk with my hand behind my back the way I would if I was Jane Austens character and it becomes somewhat of a habit, said Fernando.
Playing Bingley was fun he says. I would say that Bingley is genial and innocent. Darcy has an influence in Bingleys life in a positive way. In a way playing Bingley gave me an ego boost with me falling in love with the character. There were a lot of interesting moments playing Bingley. It was a mature senior role that I liked. The entire plot is unpredictable. Darcy starts out with very little charm but as the plot develops he becomes more likable. That change of character is inspiring to me. I think the book teaches you the lesson that some people can change. That is conveyed through Darcy. That in itself has helped me look at things differently. I feel that you need to give people a chance to learn from their mistakes and move on. This is an important lesson in Pride and Prejudice, explained Fernando.
Janani Vithanage played the role of the famous Elizabeth Bennet, the heroine who jumps to conclusions without having adequate information about others characters or their circumstances.
In life, you need to understand that there are extremes. You need to appreciate the things in between as well. Drama helps you understand this. When molding yourself to the character, there are so many things you need to understand. I played Elizabeth in Pride and Prejudice and there are various sides to her character. She is very vivacious. That in itself helps you understand the things between the extremities in life, said Vithanage.
Elizabeth had her own opinions. She liked expressing them because she was intelligent. She did not let the conventional image of a woman get her down. That is something I admire in her character and I can relate to that. It was easy for me to get into the role. When playing a drama, you get to direct your energy into something that is productive, pointed out Vithanage.
She has been in many plays such as A Midsummer Nights Dream and Plague of Rats - an adaptation from the Pied Piper. It was interesting taking part in Pied Piper because we gave the rats different personalities. We had to be really united to make the play a success, stated Vithanage.
Dojith Pathirana played the character of Mr. Wickham the crafty and deceitful opponent of Mr. Darcy.
It was so much fun playing that character. Working alongside the others was so good. I found my character quite interesting. My personality is such that I was able to effectively deliver the goods when enacting that character. I definitely treasure these memories. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most interesting plays I have taken part. Authors like Austen touch on important themes. I would say that doing drama has improved my personality when it comes to articulating what I feel. I will definitely take away the memories and friendships I have formed through drama, said Pathirana.
Devin Ganegoda pointed out that you are able to explore yourself through another person in drama.
I played the character of Mr. Darcy. The word Pride comes from Mr. Darcy, who comes from a very aristocratic family. Darcys character is extremely proud which is completely different from my character. So I had to put in a lot of effort. I read the book and watched the film many times into the character. The rest of the cast were helpful. In the end Darcy is human and has feelings and is attracted to Elizabeth. This is something which we may even see in real life, said Ganegoda.
Meth Abeysinghe played the role of Alice in Alice in Wonderland, a story full of imagination.
When portraying a character, you can feel their emotions. It helps you adapt to different situations you will face in life. I have been acting for some time, and when you examine the perceptions of different characters, you understand the reasons as to why they are doing evil or good. When I was small I had a lot of stage fright. Drama helped me deal with situations, said Abeysinghe.
Playing Alice was a pleasurable experience for Abeysinghe, because after all it is a story that has entertained children and adults alike in a splendid fashion.
"Alice resembles me, because she is curious and mischievous. It has been one of my favourite fairy tales. It was not difficult for me to portray Alice. Alice in the beginning is very stubborn and does not listen to anybody but throughout the journey she matures. Becoming another character and completely forgetting yourself, gives you a sense of freedom, said Abeysinghe.
Abeysinghe took part in Pride and Prejudice as well where she played Charlotte Lucas. She commented that we can see stories like Pride and Prejudice in real life as well because in the world there is a lot of prejudice towards people.Pride and Prejudice. Pictures by Sarath Peiris

When victims are many and beneficiaries none
Shock waves generated by mob attacks on Muslims in Ampara, Digana and few other places in the Kandy district still reverberates in our ears and fills our hearts with remorse. Though normalcy has been restored at a heavy price, an uneasy peace reigns in the hill capital.
If one peruses the media he or she could discern a variety of interpretations as to what happened as well as how and why it happened. Though violence originated in response to two isolated incidents, violence was the work of an organised gang. In the first instance in Ampara not only the consequences but even the original incident seems to be pre-planned. It was based on a myth  the supposed contamination of food with what was described as an infertility pill. In the second incident at Digana, the mob violence was not spontaneous or instant. It was a belated response, few days after the incident.
Opinions differ whether there was a political hand behind the violence or not. Meanwhile accusations are hurled against the ruling parties as well as against the Joint Opposition. In so doing nobody including the highest in the land is spared.
Whoever is to blame, what is mob violence It is not an economic or a cultural phenomenon. It is a deliberate political act. If it is not an isolated individual act and is organised, orchestrated and widespread it should be result of an action by politically motivated groups whether they comprise members of a political party, religious or an ethnic group or any other grouping.
Economic repercussions
It is clear that the masses have been provoked by some elements hostile to the Muslims or who resent the peaceful co-existence of different ethno-religious communities. May be they have vested economic or political interests or are committed to an ideology of hegemony and domination.
This violence and destruction is most inhuman. It is not worthy of human nature. It drags the whole society from civilization to savagery. Our countrys name has been sullied. If repeated, such violence would once again make Sri Lanka a pariah state among the nations of the world.
It is time to soberly ponder over the economic repercussions of such violence and restore sanity in society. Sri Lanka has chosen an export-oriented development strategy. As a small country with a limited market we have to get integrated with the world economy. There are no independent self-sufficient nations in this age of globalization.
Look at our principal sources of income. They are remittances by expatriates working abroad, especially the domestic workers in the Middle East, earnings from apparel exports, tourism and the tea trade.
In 2017 our Number One foreign exchange income of $ 7.1 billion was from expatriate remittances. The bulk of it came from the Arab countries in West Asia. Attacks on Muslims here would harm this avenue for foreign employment for our citizens, thus depriving the country of a valuable source of income. Further, we would also have to forgo the aid we receive from our friendly countries in the region and face isolation at international fora.
We derive our second source of foreign exchange from the export of garments which brought the country US $ 4.7 billion in 2016. Europe and the United States are our principal buyers. Communal riots would earn us their wrath as they are particular about the preservation of human rights. Besides they are our principal trade partners too.
Next, in order of importance, is tourism. Now more than 2 million tourists visit our country in a year. In 2016 revenue from tourism was US $ 3.5 million.
Civil unrest due to communal violence would deny us most of these benefits and our economy would be precariously undermined. That would be a catastrophic consequence of communal violence.
Added to it will be loss of property and human lives, possible resurgence of civil war and destruction of the future of our present and future generations.
The entire population would suffer except a handful of those who benefit by war and our country would be a testing ground for armaments of big powers.
Communal violence
On the other hand, what can anyone gain by such ethno-religious communal violence They would gain absolutely nothing. Neither Buddhism, nor Islam or Christianity or Hinduism would gain anything. Nor would their adherents gain any material or spiritual benefits. Even the attackers would not gain anything, except perhaps enjoying a sadistic pleasure at ones performance.
In this tragic hour of despair there was also hope. Substantial sections of the Sinhala Buddhist clergy, including members of the Maha Sangha came forward to protect the Muslims, to express their condemnation of violence. This is an unprecedented phenomenon acknowledged by the victims themselves.
However, there are some disturbing voices emanating from intellectual sources that tend to justify or minimize the gravity of the crime committed by the mob. For example, an erudite scholar was arguing that in developing countries minorities enjoying privileged status dominating the market under liberal democracies inevitably face backlash against them from the majority community.
Islamic fundamentalism
The fact of the matter is that until recently Muslims were one of the most backward communities in the island. It is only affirmative action by some past governments that has enable to make some progress. Under these circumstances he was trying to identify the growing self-consciousness of the Muslim community and the entrepreneurial acumen of some of its members as factors that could explain the phenomenon of mob violence that was witnessed during the last few days. Such are the ideological mentors of the racist mob.
Hilarious as it sounds he was also referring to Muslims voting en bloc at elections under the One man  One vote system. Not only Muslims other communities also do so at times. There are even people who vote en bloc for their caste. Ask any party nomination board how they select candidates to contest the elections and the answer will be found.
Islamic fundamentalism is a post - World War II phenomenon which has proliferated widely especially following the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, Sri Lanka is free from it. This is due to the absence of Muslim communalist forces of any significance in our country. Therefore, to speak of Muslim communalism in its absence is an indirect justification of majoritarian communalism.
There is also a talk that the recent communal violence was a result of an international conspiracy. While the influence of geo-politics and interferences of intelligence services of foreign powers cannot be ruled out the basic cause of the violence is internal. Hence, ignoring the internal factor is protecting the culprits.

Business could perish if 100 meter restriction  on selling tobacco products imposed
The planned 100 meter restriction on selling tobacco products would adversely affect medium scale eateries and retails shops, alleged the Tobacco Retailers Association in a press briefing yesterday in Colombo.
The association also said that the tobacco traders in Sri Lanka are finding it increasingly difficult to carry out their legal businesses, selling a legal product because of the various unfair laws and unlawful enforcements by various government authorities. The most recent, is the governments proposal to introduce laws banning the sale of cigarettes within a 100-meter radius of schools and other establishments frequented by persons who are under the age of 21 and the sale of cigarettes in single stick form. Such a move will put many traders out of business and around 10,000 traders in Colombo alone would be negatively impacted s a result of this move.
There are around 125,000 retailers island wide who are involved in the sale of tobacco products, which include legal cigarettes and beedi. The Tobacco Retailers Association represents around 7,500 such retailers. The association was formed in 2017, in the face of many unlawful enforcements and other challenges, which impacted the businesses.
We have been carrying out our businesses, which includes the sale of cigarettes among other consumer products, in a legal manner for many years. We have always operated our businesses in compliance with the law of the land, by ensuring that no one is allowed to smoke within our shops, dont advertise cigarettes in our shops and we do not sell tobacco products to persons under the age of 21.
In the past, we could generate a good income, support many livelihoods and be successful businessmen in our own right within our own communities. However, this changed drastically in 2016, when the government decided to increase the taxes on legal cigarettes without taking the plight of our traders into account. Our sales fell drastically almost overnight and many of us felt the economic pressures of this increase, as many consumers started to shift towards illegal or smuggled cigarettes, said K L S De Silva, President The Tobacco Retailers Association.
You may wonder why the sale of tobacco/cigarettes is such an important part of our business. It is important not only as it generates direct revenue to traders but also because it creates sizeable foot traffic to our outlets. A consumer who walks into a shop to buy a cigarette often buys a cup of tea, a soft drink, a bun or any other food item, which means we generate more income than merely by selling a cigarette. Most consumers would come to an outlet 3 or four times a day. Losing this means that many of our traders will not just lose revenue, but most will go out of business, said Nilasntha Costa Secretary.
He alleged that although they had spoken to the president and the prime minister, handed over petitions highlighting their plight, they have all fallen on deaf ears.
The association requested the government to stop the activities by vested parties to destroy their legal businesses by introducing impractical and unfair laws, stop all unlawful enforcements and harassment of traders who are involved in carrying out their legal businesses, take strict action against smugglers of cigarettes and traders that peddle these products to children.

Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital a burden on economy now
SAITM Medical Students Parents Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne yesterday said that it was a crime for the government to maintain Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital at a huge cost to the economy that has no patients and clinical training for medical students.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said it was financial fraud to run the hospital at a governments expenses although there are plans to sell it off. The Health Minister and its Secretary must be held responsible for the fraud, he said.
Government doctors do not work at the hospital. A few students who passed the final exam of the SAITM work here to treat patients. They are paid by the government, he said.
If the President has appointed a Presidential Commission on the SAITM issue as we suggested, we could have been caught as culprits behind the issue. President Maithripala Sirisena made a correct decision with a directions that only the qualified students of the SAITM should be enrolled to the KDU, he said. SAITM crisis erupted again as there was a new proposal to take all SAITM students to the KDU.
There is a proposal to put the word SAITM within brackets in the degree certificate after SAITM students qualified with MBBS at the KDU.

Financial Intelligence Unit,  a jolt to real estate business
The abolition of value-added tax (VAT) on real estate transactions, easing of cash restrictions, dismantling of overlapping regulations in the construction sector would attract more FDI into real estate sector, said Ravi Abeysuriya, Group Director of Candor.
Abeysuriya said the introduction of 15% VAT on apartment sales with effect from April 1, 2018 and the introduction of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) reporting of cash transactions on apartment purchases will pose major challenges for real estate business in Sri Lanka.
Abeysuriya made these remarks at the recently concluded LAMUDI Re-Connect: Property 360 event held in Colombo.
Sri Lanka needs to make infrastructure an attractive value proposition for FDI to flow especially into real estate sector, making Colombo an ideal overseas retirement haven. In addition, Urban Development Authority needs to promote, implement and regulate development activities.
According to the CBSL, the Residential sub-index recorded a (YoY) growth of 9.7%, while the Commercial and Industrial sub-indices recoded year- on-year growth of 11.2%, 10.1% respectively
The land price index (LPI) end 2017 for the Colombo District, has recorded a year- on-year growth of 10.4%, the lowest since 2015s 14.5%, owing to the recent trends in land price movement.
Land prices in core areas of Colombo City (Colombo 1, 2 and 3) are likely to peak with 270 hectares of new land coming into the market in 2018/2019 in the port city equipped with supporting infrastructure and urban landscaping with clear titles, which will be much more attractive to developers, Abeysuriya noted.

Kerawalapitiya Phase 2 tender still in limbo
The presence of LTL Holdings, an 100% locally owned company is a big issue for all the foreign companies collectively, said Ravindra Pitagalage, Chief Financial Officer, LTL Holdings at the 35 year celebrations in Colombo on Wednesday.
In the past there were severe competition from European companies but now the entire picture has changed with companies from India and China entering the fray.
The issue is these competitors are typically low priced and low quality and LTL has to compete with them with a high quality service or a product, he said.
There I would say they find us a big problem, he said. Competition is all right. But we have seen people sponsoring politicians against us, writing to newspapers, websites and even ADB to blacklist us.
With regards to the Kerawalapitiya tender he said they were the lowest by a huge margin there. The second lowest is a Chinese company the gap between us and them is about one Rupee per unit of electricity. The plant is supposed to deliver about two billion units every year. That means an Rs two billion difference every year to the country.
Pitigalage said the tender has been in the limbo for over one year on grounds that their project cost has been worked out with the assumption on exemption on VAT and NBT. Had the tender being offered to LTL half of the work of the project would have been done by now, he said.
What will happen ultimately is that this will probably get cancelled he said.
LTL by now has over 1,500 megawatt locally and overseas. During the past decade the foreign exchange earned through the power plants built overseas by LTL has exceeded Rs 24 billion and the total savings the government was able to make amounts to Rs 200 billion.
In addition the company also brings in more foreign exchange though the manufacture and sale of transformers which are exported to 24 countries.

SL has high use of internet, smartphones but very low on e-commerce
Sri Lankas internet and smartphone use has grown to a considerably high level in recent years but e-commerce users among them are still low-with unsatisfactory penetration.
Meanwhile, Genevas International Trade Centre has called for expanding Lankan e-commerce payment facilities beyond present set of few, large financial institutions so that more Lankans can get online to transact.
Despite the high rate of smart phones, social media use and the high potentials for e-commerce in Sri Lanka, the use of our e-commerce is still at low levels and at low penetration said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the launch event of two day National Public Private Dialogue for a Fairer Digital Marketplace by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) under him.
The event is supported by the European Union and Genevas International Trade Centre (ITC).
Sri Lanka has been ranked high on e-commerce in the Top 10 developing and transition economies in East South and Southeast Asia by the 2017 UNCTAD business to consumer e-commerce Index report. Sri Lankas overall rank in this report is 73 out of 144 countries, said Minister Bathiudeen,
New York based internet research firm STATISTICA estimates 25% of Sri Lankans are using all types of social media including Facebook. Despite the high rate of smart phone and social media use and the high potentials for e-commerce in Sri Lanka, the use of our e-commerce as a platforms is still at low levels, and we can say that it is at low penetration levels.
Sri Lankas annual domestic e-commerce only sales value is around an estimated $ 19 million or an estimated Sri Lanka Rs 3,000 million. This means only one percent of our total consumer sales in the domestic market is done though e-commerce sales. The biggest reason for the small size of our e-commerce platform is that the Lankan e-commerce industry is still in its early stages with the need for many more new startups to join it and expand it.
Perhaps the most important reason is that Lankan consumers despite showing a very high rate of smart phone use are going slow on e-commerce transactions is due to their fear on the unsafe nature of online sales, on their online safety as well as lack of protection of their online data. ITCs expert Prof Geist highlighted the key bottleneck faced by Lankan e-commerce.
It is exceptionally encouraging to hear his recognition of the tremendous e-commerce opportunities as well as challenges presented in Sri Lanka said Professor Geist.
Though Sri Lanka has an electronic transactions law in place  (the Electronic Transactions Act, No. 19 of 2006) e-commerce experts and market players call for changes to it to bring it in par with international best practices.
The two-day session will also focus on facilitating online fund transfer to and from Sri Lanka using such well known global platforms as Paypal.

7,000 shoes on Capitol lawn to honour lives lost
US: Seven thousand pairs of children's shoes were lined up on the southeast lawn of the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C., Tuesday in memory of every child who has died due to gun violence, the global advocacy organization Avaaz, who coordinated the display, said.
The 7,000 shoes in the Monument for our Kids installment represent every child that was killed by gunfire since the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in 2012, according to Avaaz.
We are bringing Congress face to face with the heartbreak of gun violence, Oscar Soria, a senior campaigner with Avaaz, told ABC News. All of these shoes cover more than 10,000 square feet.
Though most of the shoes were collected in a two week period, some of those were donated by families that lost their children to gun violence.
About five families came that were victims of gun violence, Soria said. It was an emotional moment today.
One of the parents in attendance Tuesday was Tom Mauser, whose son was killed in the Columbine school massacre.
Ill be traveling to D.C. literally wearing my son Daniels shoes, the ones he wore the day he died at Columbine, Mauser said, according to a statement from Avaaz. I think this kind of event with shoes offers a very powerful metaphor both for how we miss the victims who once filled those shoes and also for how we see ourselves wanting to walk in their place, seeking change, so that others dont have to walk this painful journey.
Also in attendance was Andy and Barbara Parker whose daughter, Alison, was shot on live television in 2015 while doing a news report for CBS affiliate station, WDBJ, in Roanoke, Virginia, Avaaz said in the statement.
The organization also said that some celebrities donated shoes as well, including Bette Midler, Susan Sarandon, Alyssa Milano, and Chelsea Handler.
It's amazing to see, Soria said. People are just coming and taking pictures and just looking at this reflection of gun violence.
The shoes will be taken off the lawn around 2 p.m. Tuesday, but Soria said that all 7,000 pairs will be donated to charity.
This isn't the first display addressing gun violence from Avaaz.
In February, the advocacy organization put up a trio of mobile billboards by Sen. Marco Rubio's home in Miami, Florida. The billboards asked why there was no congressional movement on gun control, with one of the billboards reading, How come, Marco Rubio

67th Anniversary :
Air Force reaches out to people of Sri Lanka
The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) celebrated its 67th Anniversary on March 02 without much pomp and pageantry, instead reaching out to the people of Sri Lanka, whom it serves, to let them see and experience what the Air Force is doing, what it was capable of doing, and where it is heading. Equal emphasis was given to fostering reconciliation and unity and assisting those whose needs the Air Force had the wherewithal to fulfil.
The main event was the Air Tattoo 2018, a continuation of the programme that was started last year, on the 66th Anniversary, when an Exhibition and Tattoo was held in Ratmalana and again in Vavuniya.
Based on the recommendation of Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy, the event was organized in the East, to reach out to the people of the Province, having successfully reached out to the people in the capital and the Northern Province previously. Accordingly, the SLAF Station in the Eastern town of Ampara was selected as the venue for the Air Tattoo 2018.
The event was declared open by Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, on March 03. Replete with air shows, aerobatic displays, parachute displays, a display by Regimental Special Forces, an air dog show, a band and drill display, a cultural show and a musical extravaganza each day, the Tattoo was held on three consecutive days, daily drawing large crowds of over 45,000, who came braving the threat of inclement weather.
The entrance was free, encouraging all to experience and enjoy, and large numbers of children enjoyed the exhibits and the displays.
Guwan Papedi Sawariya
Another significant event of the celebration and yet another endeavour to connect with the people of Sri Lanka in the spirit of unity and amity, the annual Guwan Papedi Sawariya was flagged off from opposite the Air Force Headquarters in Colombo, immediately after the formal parade, to mark the 67th anniversary on March 2.
The race etched its way through a rigorous route covering 124.9km on the first day finishing in Puttalam, 173km on the second day finishing in Hingurakgoda, and then covering 149.9km to finish in Ampara town. A separate womens race was flagged off at Batticaloa on the morning of March 4 to also finish in Ampara town.
Cyclists from all around the country, as well as from other countries, participated in this race covering a total distance of 458.6km. Madushanka Fernando of the SLAF won the overall championship, while the team event was also won by the Sri Lanka Air Force Cycle Team. The womens race from Batticaloa to Ampara was won by Shyamali of the Civil Security Department (CSD), while Niroshani Perera (SLAF) and Sandya Kumari (CSD) finished second and third respectively. The womens team event was won by the Sri Lanka Air Force Womens Cycling Team.
CSR projects
In keeping with its commitment to serving the people, the SLAF Colombo took the lead in a programme entitled Climb the Peak, Protect Nature at Adams Peak, to help clean the large amounts of waste left behind by devotees.
In addition, the SLAF Station in Mullativu carried out a clean-up programme at Mullativu Hospital as well as a blood donation campaign, while the SLAF Academy China Bay constructed a classroom for Sidhdhartha School in Trincomalee.
The SLAF base in Katunayake conducted a blood donation campaign and clean-up of the Air Force road from the 20th Mile Post to the main guard room. a shramadana campaign and providing of lunch for the inmates of the Disabled Caring Centre at Anandapura, and a clean-up programme at the Negombo Hospital.
The SLAF Station in Mirigama engaged in a shramadana campaign and provided breakfast for Seth Sewana Elders Home at Botale and Ape Lamai Children's Home at Mirigama and built a Drugs Storage Building for the Mirigama Base Hospital.
The SLAF Station in Palavi upgraded the facilities of Hadayath Nagar Muslim Maha Vidyalaya at Madurankuliya. The project consisted of renovation of toilets, construction of a play area for the children and construction of a field lecture area.
The SLAF Base in Vavuniya constructed a Budhu Madura for Gunananda Vidyalaya, Vavuniya.
Future goals
Looking back on the journey that started with its modest beginnings in 1951 as the Royal Ceylon Air Force, under the leadership of its first Commander, Group Captain Graham Clerke Bladon, the Sri Lanka Air Force has much to celebrate. After 67 years, today, it is a battle-hardened, proven and experienced force. Looking back on the successes and failures, achievements and sacrifices, all airmen, young and old, feel a sense of achievement and pride. Fifteen commanders have led and steered its course to make it what it is, and today, its controls are in the able hands of Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy.
While taking pride in its achievements, the SLAF is ever looking forward, ever evolving to face the threats and challenges that emerge daily, said Air Force Spokesman Wing Commander Gihan Seneviratne. The changing world order and the geopolitical landscape, or more aptly the skyscape, requires that we look at evolving faster, changing our paradigms, and setting our sights further than we have in the past. Today, our responsibility is not restricted to defending the skies above Sri Lanka alone. Nor is it confined to the traditional role of air power in the conventional scenario. Today, we have a role to play in the securing of our maritime boundaries and fulfilling our national obligations as a player on the world stage. Our increased involvement in UN peacekeeping missions contributes to the national economy as well. We are stakeholders in the promotion of aviation in Sri Lanka. Within our own boundaries, we take an active role in deterring the spread of narcotics and preventing the destruction of our invaluable forest cover and our ecological balance and bio diversity.
As our roles and functions grow, we are taking proactive measures to ensure that our inventory and our skillset evolve and grow. For if we fail to do so, or even if we are too slow to do so, we run the risk of become ineffective in playing our part in the development of our nation. Therefore, as always we train and we strive to fly, fight and win, he said.

Arrest warrant issued on Arjuna Mahendran
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday issued a warrant written in English for the arrest of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue.
Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne made this order in the wake of prosecutions request that an arrest warrant be issued on Arjuna Mahendran, the first suspect in the case, since he failed to comply with the court orders.
Issuing a warrant for the arrest of the former Central Bank Governor in terms of section 63 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the Magistrate observed that the court decided to make this order since there is sufficient material to prove that he is alleged to have committed cognizable offences under Public Property Act and Penal Code.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued an order directing former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to appear before the CID to make a statement, before March 8 this year. The notices in this regard were sent through DHL Courier Service.
Giving evidence in this regard, CID Inspector Dharmalatha Sanjeewani informed Court that a representative of DHL Courier Service, in Singapore, had reported that the recipient has moved out after it visited Arjuna Mahendrans residence, in Singapore. She said investigations conducted so far has revealed that the suspect is alleged to have committed an offence which caused a sum of Rs. 688 million lost to the government. The Court was informed that Arjuna Mahendran had been made aware that he has been noticed to appear before the CID.
Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till March 29 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence were not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
The Magistrate observed that the concerned Treasury Bonds can be considered as property described under Section 388 of the Penal Code.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate granted permission to the CID to record statements from Aloysius and Palisena at the Colombo remand prison.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda with Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the CID.

Bangladesh include star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan for crucial match:
Bowlers have to step up on good pitches  Hathurusingha
Sri Lanka head coach Chandika Hathurusingha said that his bowlers will have to step up because the pitches prepared for the Hero Nidahas T20 tri-series matches have been very good.
Hathurusingha was reflecting on the shocking defeat Sri Lanka suffered at the hands of Bangladesh even after posting a total of 214 which is normally considered a winning score. But in this instance Bangladesh stunned Sri Lanka by chasing down that target to post a record win.
The two teams are now clashing in their final league match where the winner of todays game at the R Premadasa Stadium will meet India in the final on Sunday.
Its a very crucial game, but were preparing as normal. The advantage we had is that we played them recently. We know a lot about them and they know a lot about us as well. Theres nothing that both teams can do as far as surprises go, said Hathurusingha at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
The second game put us under pressure a little bit. You dont lose many games after scoring 214 runs. They put our bowlers under pressure. I dont think we bowled well, we need to accept that. Then again saying that, all six bowlers or five bowlers dont go for 10 runs an over many times in your career. At the same time we have to give credit to Bangladesh for the way they batted, he said.
On the preparation of pitches Hathurusingha said, In this tournament the bowlers have to step up because the pitches are very good. You cant blame them either. If you know our bowlers, I think in T20I, we have a very young attack. Some of them have played less than 10 matches, but thats not an excuse. Thats why we are here we want to give them experience.
The challenge for them is the conditions. Our batting is very good, its been easy to score runs off the new ball and the field restrictions, so were maximising that. If you look at our last five T20s our record is better than during our previous ten matches overall. We have to improve, were not number one or the number two team in T20I. Theres a lot to improve and thats what were working on, he said.
Although Sri Lanka lost back to back matches after beating India in the lung-opener of the series, Hathurusingha said the defeats didnt change their style of preparations.
Our preparations as far as bowling, we have given it some thought. At the start of the tournament we felt that these were our best bowling options and my opinion on that hasnt changed. We have prepared well. Just like we prepared for the first game, we have prepared for every game therein. Our preparations are consistent. We are always of the mindset that if we continue along those lines then the outcome will more often than not be in our favour.
Bangladesh have included their star all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan in the squad after a finger injury but whether he is fit enough to play is a matter of conjecture.
The only thing I can think of is that if Shakib is half fit, I think its a desperate measure (to include him in the squad). If hes fit Bangladesh really have an advantage, because he is the worlds number one all-rounder and we all know that he is a quality player, said Hathurusingha.
Bangladesh coach Courtney Walsh who has worked alongside Hathurusingha when the Sri Lankan was head coach of Bangladesh said that Shakib was on his way to Sri Lanka and like any other player he will be assessed before being included in the playing eleven.
If he is fit, he will be considered to play. We are hoping he will be fit enough to play. He had a net session in Dhaka. We were hoping to have him from the beginning of the tournament. He was always part of the setup. We knew he was going to make a comeback if there was any chance for him. It is nothing to worry about. Once Shakib is fit, we are going to welcome him to the team, said Walsh.
The former West Indian fast bowling great said that the conditions have been reasonably good so far and that most of the matches have been won chasing except yesterday (Wednesday). We are happy to bat or bowl first. We just need to play a lot better and with more consistency.
Walsh said that it was crucial to have variations in the bowling in this tournament. You have to have the change of pace and yorkers. It is what completes a good skills set. Execution in the middle hasnt been as consistent as it can be, Walsh said.

CA extends order staying proceedings into Basil's almanac case
The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended its Interim Order staying any further proceeding into the controversial almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga currently presiding over Court No.6 until May 10.
Court of Appeal President Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne made this order consequent to a Transfer Application filed by former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa. Rajapaksa sought an order staying any further proceedings into the almanac case heard before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
The Court was informed that the Attorney General had already filed objections against the interim order.
Rajapaksa was directed to file his counter objections before April 6.
Rajapaksa has sought an order transferring the case from Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to any other High Court of Colombo.
Judge Kulatunga also delivered the judgment regarding the Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him.
He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.

The Colombo capability
New Zealand is planning to establish formal diplomatic relations with Colombo this year. NZTE is planning another trade mission to Sri Lanka. Having had several visits to this tropical island during his term, former Prime Minister John Key appeared to be a big supporter of Sri Lanka. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern may enjoy watching the elephants, walking on golden beaches and the taste of pure Ceylon tea if she visits to open the diplomatic relations in Colombo. Connecting one of the busiest shipping routes in the world, Sri Lankas geographic location links the east and west in the spice routes, also known as maritime silk roads. Most importantly Sri Lanka may open a strategic trade channel for New Zealand exporters to enter into the South Asian market.
Objectives
One of the key objectives of New Zealands Sri Lanka business strategy may be opening a trade channel to the rest of South Asia. Although South Asia has a huge market, Sri Lanka is relatively a small market. Therefore, the objectives of NZs Sri Lanka business strategy should go beyond Sri Lanka to cover all South Asia - especially India. It should underpin New Zealand governments aim to grow New Zealand exports from 30 per cent to 40 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2025.
Market
South Asia comprises Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. It covers 20 per cent of Asia's land area and is home to the largest proportion of its population. Thanks to India, South Asias GDP in 2016 was nearly US$3 trillion (NZ$4.05 trillion). However, Sri Lanka is home to only 21 million people. It is a small island with a land area of 63000 sq. km. Although, Sri Lankas GDP in 2016 was over US$80 billion (NZ$108 billion), all the other South Asian countries (except Afghanistan and Maldives) expect higher GDP growth than Sri Lanka in 2018.
Differentiation
In an era where everyone is targeting the Asian market due to its growth and population, New Zealand has to differentiate itself in South Asia to become successful. In Sri Lanka people may know about NZ as a Cricket playing nation. Since Rugby is also popular in Sri Lanka, they may also admire All Blacks. Sri Lankans may know that Fonterra dairy products are from New Zealand. But New Zealand is not just sports and dairy. New Zealand has a lot to offer to Sri Lanka and South Asia. New Zealand may need to build a country-level message to promise what New Zealand can offer to Sri Lanka as well as to South Asia. That promise will ultimately be NZs brand in South Asia.
Goods and services
In 2016, NZ and South Asia recorded over US$1.5 billion (NZ$2 billion) goods trade. Goods exports and imports wereUS$880 million (NZ$1.2 billion and US$580 million (NZ$800 million) respectively. By mid-2016 NZ and South Asia recorded over US$1 billion (NZ$1.4 billion) in services trade. NZ exported over US$880 million (NZ$1.2billion) and imported US$190 million (NZ$260 million) worth of services.NZ goods exported to Sri Lanka were worth US$175 million (NZ$239million). In contrast, goods imported from Sri Lanka were worth US$ 34 million (NZ$47m).
In terms of New Zealand exports Dairy may lead the table. But New Zealand may benefit more by thinking beyond just exporting.
Sri Lanka can be a location for value addition. The Sri Lankan agricultural sector may look for new technologies and plantation methods that can be provided by Kiwi agricultural specialists. Although not very well known, NZ also appears to have a successful information communications technology business and Sri Lanka may provide a base to expand that business in South Asia.
Struggling Sri Lankan Airlines may welcome some consultancy from a leading airline such as Air New Zealand. New Zealand can also be a promising destination for Sri Lankans looking for tertiary level education. Entering a government university is an extremely competitive task and only the best minority receives a place atone. Therefore the majority has to look for other options and New Zealand can be one such destination.
Fonterra has been in business in Sri Lanka for a few decades. It has been providing considerable number of employment opportunities and investments to Sri Lanka and may be in a position to share market intelligence with other New Zealand firms.
Sri Lankas existing Trade Agreements in South Asia can be the business model to gain a gateway to South Asia. Sri Lanka already has two bilateral trade agreements with India and Pakistan. Sri Lanka is also a part of the Agreement on South Asian Free Trade Area, South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and the Asia Pacific Trade Agreement. All these agreements provide trade channels - mainly to South Asia. NZ may be able to capitalize on these channels by having New Zealand firms expand their business in Sri Lanka.
The India Sri Lanka Trade Agreement can be the most important agreement for NZ. There may be attempts to expand this agreement further to make it more comprehensive. India was the largest trade partners of Sri Lanka in 2016.In 2016 two-way goods trade was over US$4.5billion (NZ$6 billion). But Sri Lanka is Indias 38th largest goods trade partner in 2016.
India is an important market for New Zealand, but maintains high tariff levels such as more than a 30 per cent average tariff on agricultural goods. It is the 17th largest goods trade partner of New Zealand. In contrast, NZ is the 72nd largest goods trading partner of India. India expects over 7 per cent GDP growth in the next couple of years and that may open many opportunities for foreign firms. Although NZ and India are negotiating a trade agreement, it seems like two countries may take a considerable time to conclude this agreement. A couple of key objectives of the India Strategy of NZ was to grow NZ goods exports to at least US$1.4 billion (NZ$2 billion) per year by 2015 and grow services trade by an average of 20 per cent a year. Although NZ has not yet achieved that goods export target there were tremendous increases in services trade in 2015 and 2016. Sri Lanka may provide a path to re-focus on the goods export target.
India can be a very attractive market, but New Zealand firms may need to consider whether they are in a position to supply the capacities India is looking for. Furthermore it is worthwhile for New Zealand firms to consider whether they have the skills and capabilities to navigate through the complications massive markets such as India inherits. In contrast, Sri Lanka can be a more manageable market. Furthermore, New Zealand firms may need to invest on research and development to understand South Asian market and to customize their products and services according to South Asian consumer needs and wants.
The success of the New Zealand business strategy in Sri Lanka may depend on how well NZ can understand the people, structure, incentives and culture of Sri Lanka. That may require in-depth knowledge of Sri Lanka and its history. NZ needs to find a path to balance the national interests of both countries. Furthermore, the success of business cannot be a zero sum game. New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Asia must all benefit from business relationships.

Cost of communal violence
The entire nation is weeping today due to the absurd communal riots that took place in Ampara and Kandy. It is human nature that having done the blunder worrying about the adverse effects of a bad deed. The violence cost a number of houses, business establishments, public properties and most importantly precious human lives. Neither the rioters nor the victims will benefit from these ugly incidents.
This communal disharmony has created many problems for the country and people. First, these incidents have tarnished the countrys reputation among the world nations and United Nations. Sri Lanka is just recovering from the three-decade civil war that has caused an incurable scar and a huge loss for the country and the people.
On the other hand, the government has to spend millions of rupees to compensate the victims. This is a heavy burden for the country especially as the government is seeking funds and assistance to invest in the development projects underway to boost the countrys economy.
Another blow to the government is the sudden drop in tourist arrivals. As far as tourism is concerned in Sri Lanka, it is one of the major sources of income. Countries like America, Britain and France have already requested their people to rethink about the journey to Sri Lanka due to the recent racist behaviour of the people.
This is a conflict among people. Why do we have to burn the business organisations and houses and religious places There is no sound logic between the arson and misbehaviour of the rioters. The rioters must think about their act of setting fire to properties and killing people. That will never ever bring an effective and everlasting solution for our bitterness or conflicts. The country has already faced two communal riots: 1983 and 2014. In these three communal clashes, valuable properties and business establishments were destroyed.
Besides, it cost the life of innocent people. It paved the way for misunderstanding among communities and to further animosity and hatred. Hatred cannot bring peace. Nor can it set the way for peaceful co-existence in the country.
Instead of hatred, the religious leaders, politicians and peacemakers should sow the seeds of love in the minds of people who have grown hatred and misunderstanding of their fellow countrymen. Another giant obstruction for the amicable peaceful collective life is the social media.
Every modern invention is a good servant but a bad master. The social media has made the incident worst in the country. It was like adding fuel to the burning house.
We human beings have got an extra sense to think before acting. So whenever we receive messages via social media we must always think about the authenticity of the message or news because rumour has wings and will make huge destructions.
Hence, let us make a strenuous effort to bring back peace to the country for us to live as the children of Mother Lanka.

CPC unearths kerosene racket
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's (CPC) investigative team has unearthed a racket yesterday in Kinniya in the Trincomalee district, where kerosene provided to fishermen at a subsidized price was being sold to buses and lorries in the area.
The CPC having been tipped off on the racket, had sent a special investigative team in the early hours of yesterday. They managed to apprehend three suspects while they were pumping kerosene to buses and lorries, said CPC Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga, yesterday.
The CPC run fuel shed in Kinniya is owned by the Fisheries Corporation and the kerosene supplied to the station is only allowed to be sold to fishermen at a subsidized price, while the sale of kerosene in bulk for any other purpose is illegal, explained the Chairman. An official in the investigative team speaking on the raid, said that during the past few days, they had received many calls regarding the racket, but had failed to apprehend any suspect red handed in the act of committing the crime when officers at various times visited the shed for inspection.
The officers however, were successful in arresting a driver of the lorry and his assistant who had come to purchase kerosene and the Fisheries Corporation staff member who was selling the kerosene to them. The team is further investigating into the masterminds behind the racket and they believe that powerful persons have been aiding the crime. The three arrested were handed over to the Kinniya Police.

This year the D.S.Senanayake team is playing under their veteran head coach Mothilal Jayathilake.
Meanwhile the Zahira lads will play under the watchful eyes of head coach Shamly Nawaz, who is one of the finest coaches at present. Zahirans will be captained by experienced player and number eight Muammar Deen.

Govt needs to take decisive action to deal with challenges - Navin Dissanayake
Successive governments face the challenge of balancing high debt with the need to grant subsidies to the people, said Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake as he noted that the government would have to take decisive action to deal with challenges in the next five years, if they were to remain in power.
Speaking at the First Sustainable Plantation Management (NSSPM) 2018 programme in Athurugiriya recently, the Minister noted that every politician regardless of party faces the challenge of having to run a government whilst catering to populist demand.
On the one hand every one rupee the government gets, we spend 90 cents on debt repayments; international and local. Then we have only 10 cents to spend on Samurdhi, fertilizer subsidies, free education, free health care and to make the roads and villages. And if we continue thus, that 10 cents will become 5. This is the reality. As a politician Im very sad because even if Im in the UNP, PA JVP or SLFP this will be the reality, he said.
So this would be the situation even if Mahinda Rajapakse comes into power tomorrow. So how can he change this I dont know whether he can be a magician and create new money Or will he take new loans to pay off our previous debts, he added.
This is the basic economic dilemma which the countrys economy has been trapped in. We are trapped in a debt burden, said the Minister.
So we dont have a new formula for this. Income should be increased, expenses should be reduced and management should be made efficient. Corruption and wastage should be minimized and the necessary decisions made. Therefore, Im very happy to be a part of this situation, Im very happy to be the minister of this industry which now needs innovation.
Touching on sustainability in the Plantation sector, the minister stressed that Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) since being privatized in the 1990s, have now stopped innovating though they continue to take on a huge burden in the industry. Minister Dissanayake also noted that the plantation companies needed to look more at ethical behaviour, given that in many instances there have been exploitation of labour, appropriation of profits and dishonest means to accumulate profits in the Plantation sector.
He however, remarked that there was a dire need for the government to introduce measures, means and models through effective consultation and discussion to bring up the RPCs at the bottom.
This will not be done arbitrarily but through a consultative process by bringing some checks and balances to the overall sector to introduce good governance practices and also corporate social responsibility, he said.
I want to change things, added Minister Dissanayake further, especially in the Plantation Sector. He promised changes to the tea sector next week and stressed that even if people leave, he would bring in an equally good person to take over and do things, We need to work as a team, like in any company, he said.

Venerable S Mahinda Theras 67th death anniversary falls today:
His poetry was a cultural weapon
Many poets such as Piyadasa Sirisena, Ananda Rajakaruna, Munidasa Kumaratunga, G H Perera and Venerable S Mahinda Thera emerged at the turn of the 20th Century.
They were named as the first batch of Colombo period. Of them all, Venerable S Mahinda Thera stood out as a revolutionary poet who had many talents. The Venerable Thera used the poem as a weapon to gain national independence from the British imperialists.
The poet was a Tibetan who migrated from Tibet to Sri Lanka in 1911. When the poet-monk stepped into Polgasdoowa Hermitage in Dodandoowa, he was only 11 years old. His lay name was Serki Tashinamgal. When this child was 12 years old, he took robes as Sikkim Mahinda. Venerable Mahinda Thera entered the Saraswathi Privena for primary education. He was fortunate in improving his knowledge on Sinhala, Pali, Sanskrit and English to some extent. Later, Venerable Mahinda Thera entered the Colombo Vidyodaya Pirivena for higher education. At the time, the Thera was fond of learning the Sinhala language. He had taught many subjects at Ananda College, Colombo, as an illustrious teacher. Over the final stages of life, the Thera lived in Bellana Sri Sudarmaramaya, Panadura.
National dignity among Sinhalese
Venerable Mahinda Thera rendered a considerable service to enrich Sinhala poetry and Sinhala prose.
His first book was Ova Muthu Ddama (1921). In addition, many poetry collections such as Daru Nelavilla heveth Jatika Totilla, Nidashase Mantraya, Nandana gita, Kavi Muthu, Lanka Mata and Nidahase Dehena came into existence. Venerable Mahinda Thera authored prose books such as Rahula Kumaraya and Saddarma Margaya as well.
The learned Thera published a number of high-quality poems with the objective of manifesting national dignity among Sinhalese. Some of them were written for children and the rest was for the elders. This monk grew more famous among the Sinhalese as a radical poet who appeared against the British rule. His poems contributed to meet the needs of the era. Many poems written by Venerable Mahinda Thera enriched the contemporary society. His poems helped express national and religious revival.
His poetic creations contributed to awaken the sleeping Sinhalese. The minds of the Sinhalese had to be changed in order to wee gain independence through poems.
The Thera's poetry books influenced the development of modern Sinhala poetry. The likes of P B Alwis Perera and Nandasena Ratnapala imitated his poems. The classy poem titled as Raathriya written by Ratnapala shows how he was influenced by Venerable S Mahinda Theras namesake poem.
Poetry books
Many poems written by this monk for children were remarkable. Venerable S Mahinda Thera created patriotism in the minds of children by writing authoring poetry books. The following poem could be extracted for instance.
Sirilakaya mage rataWena kisi ratak naha mataEhi matu dinuwataKarami weda mama mage taramata
This poem was written to create patriotism in children. Therefore, patriotic feelings penetrated the hearts of students. Then, many people focused their attention on doing something for their country since their little age. However, this cannot be categorized as a poem which provokes communal feelings among children.
Venerable Mahinda Thera identified children's world well. Beautiful things that could be noticed in the children's world were used by Venerable Mahinda Thera to compose interesting poetry books. His celebrated poem Rathriya is one example.
Saman pichcha mal ihirunaNil tanakola pitteniyakWagei ahasa anna balanuKochchara lassanada reta
Having identified the minds of children clearly, this poem was written with enhanced simplicity and similes to attract the childs mind. Saman Pichcha or jasmine symbolizes the stars in the sky. This simile deserves the attention of children.
Venerable Sikkim Mahinda Thera passed away on March 16, 1951. His demise was an irreparable loss to our motherland.

James PERERA the DareDevil Gymnast
In the not too distant past GYMNASTICS was a craze among clubs, schools and Community Centers. And one school that dominated this sports was St.Benedicts College, Kotahena.
Due to the foresight and love for the sport, former Directors of the school they set up a gymnasium and gave the enthusiastic gymnasts all the necessary equipment. More importantly they had a coach who had no parallel at that time in the schools, the tough looking yet likeable GEORGE ATKINSON.
Atkinson had the naturally ability to make top class gymnasts of those who came under his tutelage; and loved the sport. To name those who excelled will need reams, but one standout man was JAMES PERERA whose name and expertise is still spoken about where gymnasts of that era gather.
Natural athlete
PERERA was a natural athlete when it came to that sport. In excelling in every aspect of that sport, he was tagged tough boy and was fondly referred by that name by his school friends.
Out of the many aspects he excelled in that sport was that he rewrote the school and the countrys record books by being one of the dare devils to dive through six rings of fire. To him the Horizontal bars, Paraell bars and the Roman Rings associated with gymnastics was childs play. As if to say he toyed with them.
The Benedictine gymnasts were in great demand by the governments of that time to perform at Independence Day celebrations.
And while the team performed all the art in gymnastics the man who was appreciated and cheered lustily by the large crowd watching and lapping up the action was PERERA for his daredevilry diving through the rings of fire.
Immense interest
PERERA who showed his talents as youngster was awarded half colours and within an year was awarded full colours of the school for his immense interest, excellence, devotion, dedication and discipline for the sport.
His coach Atkinson who noticed the rare talent in him once told him: JAMES I have taught you everything in the sport to go places and to also spread the gospel of gymnastics as a coach. Your talent is immense and as a favor and in remembrance of me promise me to spread this king of sport for me all over the county.
And PERERA never forgot his guru Atkinson. He took it upon himself to spread the game of gymnastics to several clubs, schools and Forces. There was no Ministry of Sport during that period. He started the first club known as the Young Thrillers Gym club at St.Johns Mission House and he received full support from the famous Fr.Martin and Bro Charles who watched the keenness and hard work put in by PERERA wanted him to coach St.Josephs College, Grandpass which he gladly obliged.
Atkinson first President
PERERA formed the first Gymnastics Association of Ceylon and had its first president his guru George Atkinson. He served as the first secretary . Noel Rupesinghe was the treasurer. Betrem Pererand Amal Gomez the first pair to excel in hand to hand balancing at St. Benedicts, Capt W.M.H. Perera, Ashley Perera and Ranjit Boniface served as committee members.
PERERA was in great demand and he joined the Playgrounds Department of the Colombo Municipal Council and also coached the Y.M.C.A. and Y.M.B.A. PERERAS love for the sport had no limit. In those days to continued the request and the promise he made to his guru Atkinson, there was a big barrier and that was finding the equipment. Importing the equipment was out of the question because the prices were so expensive.
But determination was writ in him and he purchased a local Electric Plant. His C.G.R. experience in Engineering gave him the experience to launch out on producing the equipment. He had the help of his wife Sriya Perera who was also a keen gymnast and incidentally love struck when he was coaching the CMC where Sriya was employed which led to marriage and even today they are like two love birds.
Training session
After the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, West Germany the. G.D.R gymnasts performed here. The team comprised Erikaze Hold, Mattias Bremne Bermn Jagger and Marian Noack and had a training session with the local team. Ericka who was twice world record holder with three silver medals performed on uneven bars and balancing beam with SRIYA and was impressed with the local girls expertise. Incidentally SRIYA was the first to train a girls team at Stace Rod Community Centre and Kirilapone Community Centre in 1968 and produced many champions.
To further detail the expertise and the many champion gymnasts they produced would require reams and reams of newsprint and every act JAMES produced in school and wife SRIYA will tell it all in a book they are producing that is on the production lines.
Several champions
But JAMES contribution to the sport, the clubs, the schools, the community centres, the forces and universities and the champions he turned out are legion and too numerous to mention. His pupils still speak in admiration and appreciation of the manner he turned them into experts in Gymnastics, that sadly today is not what it was in the late 1950s,60 and 70s.
But names of those who performed with and were his seniors are Bertrem, Perera, TrevorBuultjens, Happy Gomez, Ananda Zoysa, P.Don Susantha and Robin Fernando. Buultjens was the first to dive through six rings of fire with Robin Fernando the second and JAMES PERERA the third. Many feared to perform this life threatening acts, but not Buultjens, Fernando and PERERA.
Grateful to Sugathadasa
PERERA is grateful to the first Minister of Sport V.A.Sugathadasa, also a Benedictine all round sportsman. He also acknowledges and compliments the Prime Minister of today Ranil Wickremasinghe who was then Minister of Education who helped develop sports. PERERA says Wickremasinghe picked right when he appointed Sunil Jayaweera as Director General of Sports in the Ministry of Education.
Jayaweera too was a glutton for hard work and sport being his first love and devoted a lot of his time for the betterment of sport in the country. Men of his calibre are what sport lacks today.

Lasantha murder: Ex-DIG involved in concealing evidence
Former Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara who is currently in custody, had been involved in concealing evidence and displacement of the diary of journalist Lasantha Wickramatunge and for the removal of pages of the police report, the CID told court yesterday.
This was revealed when the case relating to Lasantha Wickramatunges killing was taken up at the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court yesterday.
The CID also asked the magistrate to issue an order permitting the Police forensics lab to examine the phone details of the Ex- DIG. The judge granted approval for it and issued an order.
The involvement of the Senior DIG in concealing evidence and hampering the investigation on Lasanthas killing, was established by information revealed to the CID by the former OIC (Crimes) of the Mount Lavinia Police Tissasiri Sugathapala, earlier.
The Mount Lavinia Magistrate further ordered the two suspects currently in remand custody, Former Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara and former OIC (Crimes) of the Mount Lavinia Police Tissasiri Sugathapala to be further remanded until March 29.
OIC, Gang Robbery, IP Nishantha Silva and ASP Tissera represented the CID.
The former DIG had instructed the officer to refrain from continuing with the investigations. Further, certain pages of Lasanthas notebook had been removed and replaced. This information was found only after the CID took over the investigations two years ago. The investigations into the killing had commenced 9 years ago but no progress was made as these high ranking police officers were trying to conceal the evidence and preventing the investigations from moving forward. All these parties had banned themselves together to sweep the investigations under the carpet. This former DIG had acted upon the instructions of the former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne, the CID source said.
On January 8, 2009, Lasantha Wickramatunge was killed by two assailants who had followed him on a motorcycle at Attidiya. Yet, although investigations were initiated into this crime, the case remained stagnant with no noteworthy progress.
However, the present government recommenced the investigations, since assuming power, and evidence pertaining to this crime have been surfacing gradually.
Information had also been revealed that Lasantha Wickramatunges diary which had been found in his car at the time of his assassination, containing all his details, his mobile phone, and, several other items had been given by SI Sugathapala to an SP who had then given it to the DIG and then to the IG, and eventually, to a high ranking government official. This information had also come to light during the interrogation of SI Sugathapala.
The CID told the Daily News that the two motorcycles believed to have been used by Lasanthas assailants had been found to belong to a person from Ja-Ela, and the other belonged to a person in Nugegoda. However, in 2008, the owner of the bike from Ja-Ela had met with an accident and the motorcycle had been in police custody. The other motorcycle from Nugegoda had also been put up for sale by the owner. It is being investigated as to how these motorcycles had been used for the crime, but investigations being revealed also points to police involvement.
Meanwhile, the CID had also sought a court order to provide special security to the two suspects currently in remand. Previously Jesudasan, the primary suspect in the murder of Lasantha Wickramatunge, died while in remand prison. Similarly, the two youths who were named as Lasanthas killers, from Vavuniya, were found to have been killed previously and their bodies had been burnt a few days prior to Lasanthas assassination on January 1, 2009 by an unknown party and their charred bodies were found in the Anuradhapura area. Therefore, the CID had raised concerns about the safety of the two main suspects currently in remand.

Malik woos top Japanese investors at Tokyo Investor Forum
Japanese businesses must take advantage of Sri Lankas strategic location, preferential market access into key economies, and be an early mover in the countrys new growth drive, remarked Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama at an investor forum in Tokyo.
He was speaking to a forum of over 300 Japanese businesses alongside the visit by President Maithripala Sirisena. He recalled Japans enduring partnership in Sri Lankas development over the past six decades, and remarked We now welcome Japanese investment into our country because we know it will help transform our economy.
Japan has been a steadfast supporter of Sri Lankas infrastructure development, through generous aid and technical assistance. From the first loan back in 1965 under the Colombo Plan, Japanese development assistance has played an important and conscious role in Sri Lankas economic development through helping Sri Lanka to bridge the countrys infrastructure needs as well as aiding the growth of its industrial sector.
Sri Lanka is now on a new path of progress towards an economy that is a hub in the Indian Ocean, and an attractive place for business in Asia.
The Government has taken numerous initiatives to stabilise and re-orient the economy, from a growth model that was heavily dependent on debt-fuelled public spending, to one driven more by the private sector, trade, and FDI. We have taken many measures to build strength and resilience in our economy. We are very focused on fiscal consolidation, and the results are already visible with the budget deficit improving and the international ratings agencies providing favourable outlooks.
On monetary policy, the Central Bank has moved towards a market-determined exchange rate regime and is proactively keeping inflation in check.
We are committed to improving the ease of doing business. By mid this year, the time taken to registering a new business will reduce from 6 days to just one day.
Through the new Colombo International Financial City and Port City projects, we are creating a unique business climate that is globally-competitive and will provide an attractive operating environment like no other in the South Asian region.
These initiatives are being complemented by comprehensive trade policy reforms.
To leverage on our location and to expand market access, we are expanding our trade and investment links with a diverse set of countries  US, EU, India, China, Singapore, Japan; and we also are signing a number of trade agreements.
While we focus on growing and sustaining in our traditional markets of the US and Europe, we have begun to diversify our markets towards Asia and focus on plugging in to Asian supply chains, the Minister said.
We are close to concluding two more bilateral trade agreements - an Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement with India and a Comprehensive FTA with China. This will be followed by FTAs with Thailand and Malaysia. We also recently regained the GSP Plus trade concessions to the European Union and we already have an FTA with Pakistan.
Many Japanese investors have already found success in Sri Lanka and they include, Dockyard, Noritake, ITOCHU, SBI Holdings in financial services, Okaya Electric Industries, Toslec and FDK SG Holdings and Tokyo Cement.
We are keen to find Japanese partners who can work closely with our private sector to reach global markets, and partners who can bring in Japanese know-how and technology to us.

Marketing high  value compounds of   tea polyphenols
The consumer habits have changed all over the world, with the evolving generations such as Gen Y and the millennials. This has affected many beverages already. The usual question asked by the Gen Y is why he/she should drink a particular beverage. This generation is identified as a smarter generation and we have to provide a lot of valuable and useful information to these emerging consumer groups such as the details of the ingredients, packaging, if they were produced without guilt, their impact on the health and price. The noun guilt is used to mean if the methods used to manufacture the beverage concerned is involved in destroying the environment and exploiting the labor engaged in production. Lot more beverage companies use multiple methods to convince the consumer on the brand and product attributes in addition to the commitment of the manufacturers on sustainability.
Lack of thoughts in this direction could be a single most reason for the slow growth in value addition to tea in Sri Lanka. As a result of this failure, poor prices realized has affected attracting high caliber personal that can sustain the industry on one hand and deprived the industry of getting required agricultural inputs on the other hand. This process makes a complete vicious cycle for which the industry has now become immune. Instead of correcting the causal factors for low Net Sale Averages for ages, the general perception of the management is that the cost of production of tea is somewhat beyond the control of the management due to certain level of political interference, climate change, degraded soils highly paid workforce etc. This psychology is usually known as the blame culture which is an outcome of poor quality of the leadership.
If any tea estate can increase the NSA beyond Rs. 2000, then none of the said issues will remain to exist. We need a true paradigm shift. Neither the World Bank nor any other could offer help to us for the simple fact that no one could advise the Planter managing an industry older than a century, unless we ourselves challenge the issue and solve it by ourselves. If undertaken wisely, this will give the industry the opportunity of moving from their current stand of being price takers to price makers.
The market research indicates that there is a growing demand and higher price for Polyphenols that can be extracted from tea. Emerging new trends of tea marketing are based on its health benefits. The focus is on the polyphenols in tea. Polyphenols, the major chemical compounds present in tea flush constitute 25-30% of dry weight. Among the polyphenols, catechins (flavan3ols) have the least complex chemical structures and function as precursors in the formation of complex polyphenols. Catechins in tea have been reported to be the major source of antioxidants, which have a variety of physiological functions of the body. The main tea catechins recorded are () epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), () epicatechin gallate (ECg), () epigallocatechin (EGC), (+) gallocatechol (GC), () epicatechin (EC) and (+) catechin (C). EGCg is the most abundant catechin in tea and has proven anti-cancer activity, anti-obesity action, anti-diabetic activity, prevention of cardio vascular diseases, combined effect with theanine and vitamin C to enhance immunity against viral infection and effects on aging and dementia.
Theobromine and caffeine are two major alkaloids present in tea. Caffeine, the most important alkaloid in tea, contributes to the bitterness of the brew through complexation with the flavanols, and stimulate the nervous system of human beings, anti-obesity action, cardiac stimulant and diuretic, protection against Parkinsons disease, reduce brain damage and Improve neurotransmission efficiency of neurons. For black teas, caffeine content is in the range of 3.4-3.9% which is responsible for briskness of tea.
The major flavonols present in tea leaves make up 2-3% of the water-soluble solids in tea and Flavonols Glycosides in tea leaves have been quantified as aglycones, Quercetin, Myricetin and Kaempferol. Flavonols play an important role in reducing the risk of cardio vascular disease, cancer, neurodegradative and other degenerative diseases.
Tea contains large number of free amino acids and the theanine (5-N-ethylglutamine) is the most abundant amino acid in tea and constitutes usually between 0.2 and 2% of the dry weight accounting for up to 50% of all free amino acids in tea samples. Theanine has a calming effect on the mental state by lowering blood pressure and is known to be a neurotransmitter in the brain and Imparts mind relaxation-inducing effect in humans. It improves memory and learning ability, suppress cell death, suppress oxidative damage, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral depression under psychosocial stress. (Japan Tea Central Public Interest Incorporated Association, (2015)
The global polyphenol market in 2015 has exceeded 700 million USD.(grand view research, San Francisco, 2015) The prediction is to exceed 900 million USD in 2024. So it is obvious that we need a new product sold on the value of polyphenols in tea. The presence of higher level of polyphenols is in the correctly matured shoot. According to TRI ( SL ), some tea cultivars in Sri Lanka are more suitable to manufacture green tea using either the Chinese or Japanese methods. Green tea appears to have more polyphenols than black tea. The TRI also seem to be engaged in a process of developing a method to determine polyphenol levels in green leaf using Near Infrared Technology. This can lead to new pricing mechanism for green leaf too.
Polyphenol based product development will lead to changes in the manner in which we grow tea as a commercial crop. Similarly, there is a potential to extract other compounds such as theanine (amino acid), protein flavors and aroma from green leaves of tea., Further, the Spinning Cone Column technology and Supercritical Fluid Extraction technology could be used to extract these compounds and produce teas with improved flavors, medicinal and functional properties. Also, these purified compounds could be used in developing high value pharmaceuticals and cosmetics in the future.
SL being a small economy, it will be a waste of time to think of doing everything alone without partnering with global giants especially in the areas of joint research, distribution and marketing. Therefore it is advisable to consider linking with distribution giants such as Ali-Baba hailing from a similar culture.
Like in any other product the polyphenols alone will not get the producers to achieve higher NSA, but with complete downstream value addition. The current situation of tea could well be compared with the virgin coconut oil (VCO) market. The producers were just producing VCO with lesser focus on Medium Chain Tri-glycerides which is a derivative of VCO. As a result of not focusing on downstream value addition, the country lost a great deal of wealth that was hidden in MCT oil based products. This situation has got aggravated further because we dont have even established standards for these products. Such inaction make us paralyzed when faced with fierce competition globally. The same experiences can be avoided in tea if proactive decisions are initiated in advance with the change of the products.
Investing in research and development in a small economy like Sri Lanka may have limitations due to economies of scale. However such interventions do remain as priority needs in future as well. The research institutes have undertaken adequate research on health benefits of tea. They also have researched and come out with diversified products of tea. Tea is known for its medicinal properties responsible for reducing cholesterol, reducing blood clotting, improve immunity, reduce blood glucose levels, improves intestinal bacteria and many more. Certain chemicals found in tea are now used in the cosmetics industry which has a huge business potential. These cosmetic products are already sold in Sri Lanka. The irony of this issue is that these products are manufactured in countries who dont manufacture even an ounce of tea. So the need to leave the commodity market is a conscious decision we have to make.
Therefore as growers and producers we have a great opportunity to exploit this situation and develop new products catering to the health conscious consumers. Whilst we are suggesting equipping all crop research institutes with an all-inclusive marketing department and obtaining services of food technologists that will be of great advantage to the industry. All scientists in crop research institutions must be compensated adequately and trained in the areas of specialties keeping in line with the global standards. If the NSA can be raised beyond Rs.2000 per Kg, and help the factory owners to develop a high value basket of products, then we will not have to stick to outdated production processes and contribute to massive financial loses. Some say that we use more energy to manufacture a Kg of black tea that making a Kg of iron out of ore. Therefore quick action to transform the suggestion made above into a reality cannot be delayed any more.
The agronomy of Tea.
The concept of (QQCD) (Quality, Quantity, Cost and Delivery) in improving processes can be used to improve agronomical practices If we are deciding in favor of polyphenol based products. The first Q denotes the quality of tea means the level of polyphenols in shoots of correct maturity. This will lead to an opportunity to obtain a better price for the green leaf based on the amount of polyphenols available in leaf. I understand that the TRI is in the process of developing a quick method to ascertain the useful properties in green leaf supplied by the small holders. This will lead to whole heap of changes in the process such as timing and type of organic and inorganic fertilizers used, maintaining of nutrient rich soils, ensuring the growth of soil microbes and zero usage of harmful chemicals. In brief, producing tea without guilt.
Quantity will be referred to the bush density per unit area of land and yield per bush. Cost aspect will be the cost of a shoot/ Kg (green leaf) at correct maturity. Speed of delivery should be addressed to achieve the results within a reasonable time frame. These factors are helpful in achieving both effectiveness and efficiency. This will also give the Planters an opportunity to manage tea gardens more strategically. The emerging volumes of big data and near time information will prompt engaging IT/ICT professionals to make use of standard such as Agriculture 4.0. We can learn a lot from countries such as Israel in this direction.
To stimulate the process of thinking of the experienced Tea Planters the following key agricultural aspects are proposed to be studied deeply. (Deeper analysis of the factors will pave the way for a detailed Agri manual for tea in RPC management) The following framework is only to facilitate the thinking process or a session on brain storming. We do agree that the environmental factors and the factors affecting under HRM practices are not discussed adequately in this article.
There is a saying that the Right People Drive businesses. Absenteeism of harvesters is a big draw back in the industry. Attraction and retention has become an impossible task. We have failed (in most instances) to address these issues in a smarter manner although some other countries have overcome these issues successfully.
The job redesign advocated in the knowledge domain of HRM is one of such options. We have failed to understand that the period of slavery is now over. Employees are looking for meaningful and smart work. The want to be heard, consulted, appreciated with regular feedbacks. When compared with real life experiences on a tea estate, it is not difficult to understand how much behind we are to these naked realities of work life.
In addition to attributes affecting job redesign, having to work all seven days of the week is another aspect contributing to absenteeism. Quite apart from physical fatigue due to continuous work in relation to some others who are entitled to paid leave during a work week, the monotonous nature of the work is also a demotivating factor pressing them to be absent.
Therefore it is appropriate to look at different work systems. In the event if a harvester can bring the total quantity of green leaf, estimated for the month even on the 25th day, he or she must be given paid leave for the rest of the days of that month. This is because the harvester has already achieved the target for the month. Depending on the quality of supervision of work, this system will lead to developing better skilled in plucking and ensure guaranteed income as well. However, if the workman is desirous of working even during paid leave then the estates will not be short of work.
The industry will wither away without employees which have already begun to happen. Doing same thing we did for generations over and over again and expecting miracles to happen is simply called as insanity. We need different types of teas to continue with the mystic nature of tea, but more importantly we have a choice to decide survival & growth or else fast track the journey to the graveyard. In the event the choice is the former, then it is time to use options such as BPR or business process re-engineering etc. The total solution is a combination of factors such as manufacturing of powerful product basket, digital marketing, linking up with global giants, sticking to BMPs of agronomy and investing on a near time monitoring / implementation system. In order to achieve all above the employees have to be managed professionally using HRM concepts.

Medicos nail infertility canard
There is no contraceptive pill which is known to exist that can cause infertility or sub fertility by simply being added to food, Consultant Physician Dr. Upul Dissanayake said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Medical Association Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, a group of independent senior medical specialists said there are no known sterilisation pills in the pharmaceutical sector known to the medical profession that can cause permanent infertility.
The group of senior medical professionals conducted the media briefing on the so called sub fertility pill, which had caused a major uproar in the country lately, leading to racial clashes in Kandy and Ampara.
The media conference was convened by Prof. Chandrika Wijeyaratne, immediate past president of the Sri Lanka Medical Association and attended by a large number of senior consultants.
We are a group of medical professionals not affiliated to any professional organisation who have come out on our own accord to dispel some myths on the current news which is causing much tension, the so called infertility pill, said to be mixed with food served at eateries, said Dr. Upul Dissanayake.
The pharmaceutical industry has been searching for a medicinal drug which can cause temporary infertility so that it can be used as a male contraceptive agent, similar to contraceptive tablets taken by women to prevent pregnancies. However, such a medicine has not been developed yet, added Consultant Physician and Clinical Pharmacologist Dr. Chandani Wanigatunga.
However, Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist Dr. Lakshman Senanayake said surveys have shown some decline in the countrys male fertility. In the past not many males were willing to come forward and have themselves tested. However, now males are coming forward to have their fertility tested and this enables us to have some idea of the numbers. One of the main causes of male infertility is the lifestyle changes. As men work in offices for longer hours, they wear tight clothing for long periods which can impede on their fertility. Further, smoking and consuming alcohol could also have an effect on male fertility. But, there is nothing to suggest that male infertility is caused by any contraceptive pill, he said.
Meanwhile, an expert in Forensic Science, Toxicology, Pathology Prof. Ravindra Fernando said in instances of such complicated issues, it is the Government Analysts Department that makes the final decision.
The Government Analyst had examined the substance that was found in the kottu roti, which created panic in the country, and determined that it was a particle of starch. Now there is no suspicion whatsoever that it was not a tablet but a mere particle of starch, which led to this unfortunate incident, he said.

Moves to demand blood money for murdered Lankan Housemaid in Saudi
The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE) is looking at the possibilities of demanding blood money for the Sri Lankan housemaid, who was shot dead in Saudi Arabia last Saturday, SLBFE Deputy General Manager (Foreign Relations) P. P. Weerasekara said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the Bureau is waiting for the postmortem report by the Saudi authorities to take further action.
Islamic tradition provides for payment of financial compensation to the family of a murder victim, he said.
The DGM said a group of Sri Lankan Embassy Officers had already left Riyad to Buraidah, where the incident took place. The Saudi man, who was accused of shooting the Sri Lankan housemaid, had committed suicide by shooting himself.
We want some kind of compensation to the victims family from the sponsors side as this is said to be a murder allegedly committed by the sponsors son. However, the killer is said to be person with a mental disorder. If it is true, then there will be problems in getting financial compensation, but definitely there will be a legal procedure and it will take some time to verify those claims and documents, Weerasekara, who also met the family members of the deceased at his office,Weerasekara said.
The deceased (38) is a mother of two, from Kataburawa, Waduraba, Galle.
The elder child is married and the second son is said to be suffering from a heart problem. That is why she had gone abroad in search of money to treat the child, said the DGM.
The housemaid had been registered with the SLBFE in April 2017. She is insured by us and her family will receive that payment, he added.
Foreign Affairs Ministry Consular Division Senior Director General S.S.Ganegamaarchchi told the Daily News that the remains of the housemaid could not be brought back to Sri Lanka until the investigations in Saudi Arabia are over.
The Saudi authorities are not releasing the remains until the investigations are over. They are also hesitant to give us information until investigations are completed. Things are moving very slowly in Saudi Arabia. Our Embassy is in contact with the Saudi authorities. We are trying to get the process expedited. We have taken the required preliminary action from our side, he explained.

NCPA nabs five for sexual abuse of girl
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Special Police Investigations Unit, yesterday, arrested five persons for sexually abusing a 13-year-old girl.
They have also arrested her mother and grandmother who had given permission for the abuse. Out of those arrested, two were found to be relatives of the victim. The suspects were produced before the Wellawaya Magistrates Court. Thanamalwila Police had initially received a complaint regarding the child. Thereafter, on the directive of Wellawaya Magistrate Kesara Samaradiwakara, the NCPA had undertaken further investigations.
NCPA investigations into the case are now complete and they had been sent to the Attorney Generals department for the case to be filed in court. The present case before the Magistrates Court is to be called on March 22. NCPA Director, attorney-at-law, Marini de Livera, in a statement to the media, said the investigation was carried out under her directive by the NCPA Special Police Investigations Unit, OIC, Police Inspector Priyankara, Sub Inspector Somasiri and their team.
De Livera noted that children can be abused at any place in society and that society as a whole needs to be vigilant to prevent such abuse.
Further, to avoid such situations, children need to be made aware of what good touch and bad touch are so that they too can alert those responsible when faced with such situations.
For example, patting a child on the head is good touch (eg: parents blessing a child) whilst touching a child near his/her genitals, unless for medical purposes is considered an offence.
The NCPA also asks that adults take precautions and keep an eye on any unsafe spaces children might wander and teach them to voice out their opposition to any wrongdoing that they may face. The authority also asks parents to teach their children to inform a trusted adult when any abuse or mistreatment occurs. The public can report abuse to the nearest police station or the NCPA hotline 1929.

Rapt in a mystery island
Juliet Coombe discovers the Bahamas La Isla del Espirito Santo: the Island of the Holy Spirit  Andros, just like tropical Sri Lanka, an incredible island of unspoilt beauty and a Never-Never land of amazing story telling.
Footsteps appear and vanish in the sand below. Trying to trace these elusive sandy trails in search of the invisible men is not only impossible, but also foolhardy according to Peter, my local guide. He explains that the sinking sand will sink you under into Never-Never land. Maybe that explains why Andros is also the most sparsely populated of all Bahamian islands and the most mysterious.
As we circled to land, I felt looking out at the azure blue sea from the air, Andros looks a little bit like Sri Lanka with its sandy beaches, rocky out crops and as I get closer and the plane starts to lower its wheels to land, I can see several big footprints on the long stretch of beach below, only to vanish mysteriously into nowhere again. The air hostess seeing my surprised face explained as I put my seat belt on that according to local legend, they are made by spirits of the Lucayan tribe, the 16th Century Indian inhabitants of Andros, the largest and most surprising island of the Bahamas.
In 1492 Christopher Columbus, for good reason, dubbed Andros La Isla del Espirito Santo: the Island of the Holy Spirit. A large part of its magical charm stems from the strong sense of mythology that pervades life here. One mystical story is that of the Chickcharnies, a mischievous red-eyed, tree dwelling creature said to be half bird and half human. Legend says if you see a Chickcharnie and show it respect, you will be blessed with good luck for the rest of your life. Be careful not to sneer at it, however, or your head will turn completely around. Then theres the sea monster called Lusca, said to be the Loch Ness of the Bahamas. The mythical half-dragon, half-octopus creature apparently lives deep in the oceans blue holes and likes to drown unwary divers, or so locals like to tell you. The Yahoo and the Bosee Anansee are another two lesser-known but just as intriguing creatures that roam the mangrove-choked swamps and thick pine bush of Andros.
Alighting from the island-hopper plane, Im greeted with the smiles of my hosts from the Small Hope Resort who tell me the only rules while staying here: No shoes, telephone calls, email or contemporary magazines. With these words I know I am in my kind of paradise no matter what otherworldly creatures inhabit its seas and shores. The hardest things I need to master are the art of hammock swinging and how to mix Goombay Smash cocktails while munching on addictive Conch fritters and enjoying the fairy tale sunset.
The island is an Eden-like paradise teeming with lush green foliage, spunky land crabs and wild orchids of every possible colour. It was also once a favoured haunt of pirates and for those who have come in search of treasure, theres no better place to start looking than Small Hope Bay. This is where Henry Morgan, the regions most notorious bad-boy buccaneer, buried enough gold to buy the island several times over. But as forewarned by the resorts name youve small hope of finding his stash. In fact it was Morgan himself who supposedly named the bay saying that it was a small hope that anyone would find the treasure that he had buried. Even so, the Resort Manager, Jeff Birch, claims he came across an 18th Century cannon while swimming in the bay one afternoon. Then there are the die-hard treasure hunters who, despite the odds, rummage optimistically through the jungle and scour the seas fuelled by sunstroke dreams of a golden-bullion hoard.
Keen to conduct my own loot hunt under the waves, I join the resorts diving course. The island is fringed to the east by the worlds third-largest barrier reef (the most unexplored in the Western Hemisphere) making a scuba foray a must-do activity in Andros. In fact, it lays claim to being the oldest dive resort in the Bahamas.
The three-metre deep aquamarine ocean is so clear that 50-metre visibility is common on most days and the waters are thriving with marine life including a bunch of incredibly friendly dolphins. Those looking to up the adrenaline ante usually head over the wall: a 1,800 metre dive that plummets deep into the blues. Over the edge, dubbed the Tongue of the Ocean, are masses of colourful fish, some of the worlds deepest blue holes, spectacular coral gardens and underwater caverns and may be Lusca, the mythical sea monster.
Following a couple of treasure-less dives, and with an aversion to plummeting off underwater cliffs to meet monsters of the deep or the infamous, I succumb instead to the lure of a banana-lounge and the relaxing comforts of a beachside bar.
After a lesson from the islands resident Shaman on the art of making love potions from local flora and learning about other plants and their amazing health benefits I set about looking for firewood to build a fire and cook my dinner under the stars. In my search for fire wood I secretly hoped to find Morgans pirate treasure of gold and silver and wondered if anyone flying over head could see my footprints in the sand.

Rohithas corruption case fixed for further trial on March 21
Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne yesterday fixed for March 21, to record further evidence in a corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena.
This is for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
On an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled preliminary objections raised by former Minister against the Bribery Commission's decision to amend charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monetary transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention of section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that Abeygunawardena had owned these properties which are deemed under the provisions of the act to be property acquired through bribery.

Researchers unveil new AI that can tell if a person is male or female just by reading their smile:
The smile says it all!
New artificial intelligence can predict your sex based on your smile.
Researchers at England's University of Bradford developed the AI after noticing marked differences between males and females smiles.
They hope to study the ways in which cosmetic procedures affect these differences as well as how the research applies to transgender people in the future.
Their study was published in The Visual Computer: International Journal of Computer Graphics.
The University of Bradford researchers new AI platform is a step above already existing technology that can determine one's sex based on a photograph of their smile.
The new report said: Although automatic gender recognition is already available, existing methods use static images and compare fixed facial features.
The new research is the first to use the dynamic movement of the smile to automatically distinguish between men and women.'
For the study the researchers mapped out 49 facial landmarks, found mostly around the eyes, down the nose and near the mouth.
They used these to assess how the face changes as we smile caused by the underlying muscle movements - including both changes in distances between the different points and the flow of the smile: how much, how far and how fast the different points on the face moved as the smile was formed, the analysis said.
Next the researchers analyzed whether or not there were significant differences between women and men's smiles.
They concluded that there were, and the scientists learned that women's smiles are more expansive.
Researcher Professor Hassan Ugail said: Anecdotally, women are thought to be more expressive in how they smile, and our research has borne this out.
Women definitely have broader smiles, expanding their mouth and lip area far more than men.'
The team built an algorithm based on their analysis, and it was subsequently tested using video footage of more than 100 people smiling.
The researchers found that men's smiles are less expansive than women's. One of the scientists said that women expand their lip areas and mouths more than men do when they smile
The computer was able to correctly determine gender in 86 percent of cases and the team believe the accuracy could easily be improved, the report said.
Professor Ugail confirmed that the researchers think the technology can get better.
He said: We used a fairly simple machine classification for this research as we were just testing the concept, but more sophisticated AI would improve the recognition rates.'
The study said the point of the research was to enhance machine learning capabilities but that the research has raised questions the team members want to investigate in the future.
The researchers want to now study whether or not cosmetic surgery would impact the new AI's predicitons
One is how the machine might respond to the smile of a transgender person, and the other is the impact of plastic surgery on recognition rates, the study said.
Professor Ugail said: Because this system measures the underlying muscle movement of the face during a smile, we believe these dynamics will remain the same even if external physical features change, following surgery, for example.
This kind of facial recognition could become a next-generation biometric, as it's not dependent on one feature but on a dynamic that's unique to an individual and would be very difficult to mimic or alter.'
