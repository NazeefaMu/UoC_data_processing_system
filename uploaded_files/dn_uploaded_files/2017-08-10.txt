Dengue defeated, patients dwindling
National Hospital dengue ward closed from Aug 7:
Defeating dengue within a short period is a victory achieved by the Sri Lankan health sector. The dengue ward at the National Hospital is closed from August 7, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the dengue epidemic was reported from Kinniya for the first time. Now the number of dengue patients is going down. The wards used for dengue patients in the Negombo hospital are now being used for other patients.
Minister Senaratne was addressing the gathering during the dengue eradication programme held at Battaramulla, recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that doctors, nurses and health staffers worked tirelessly to treat dengue patients. This had significantly contributed to decreasing the number of dengue patients. During the past, the police, armed forces and field officers made a large contribution towards dengue mosquito control activities.
"There is no point in controlling dengue temporarily. Dengue can increase again if the climate changes. Therefore, all should carry out the cleaning process without interruption to make sure that dengue mosquito breeding places do not exist," the minister said.
Health Ministry officials and others were present.

## Title: Bond Commission : february 27 auction was extraordinary
## Supertitle:

## Date: Thursday, August 10, 2017 - 01:00
Bond Commission : february 27 auction was extraordinary
Received call from Public Debt Dept canvassing 30 year Treasury bond:
Perpetual Treasuries Limited CEO Kasun Palisena told the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday that he considered the February 27, 2015 Bond auction was extraordinary.
Following an exceptional line of questioning carried out by the Commissioner Supreme Court Judge, Justice P.S. Jayawardena as to why this auction was so extraordinary, Palisena said he thought so because of the change of the government and its expectation for new economic policies following that political change.
When questioned by the Commission as to why Palisena decided to bid for such a large volume, when there was no particular reason or justification for such bidding, Palisena responded that the preceding change in policy and authority prompted the risk.
Excerpts of the exchange are as follows:
Commissioner Jayawardena: An average person, by February 27, 2015, will picture a situation where Rs 1 billion is advertised, the direct placement method playing dominant and auction not a frequent. So in a background as such, what is so special or new about the February 27, 2015 Treasury bond auction
Palisena: It is the change, my lord. The change as in the change of a new government and we were expecting a change of policy from the government as well.
Commissioner Jayawardena: You said the government requirement was high due to the change of government. There was a new governor at the Central Bank. No policy announcement has been made up to this date (27 Feb.2015) by the Central Bank. No public advertisements published by the Treasury or the Central Bank on fiscal or monetary policy changes. So there was no official information for you to rely on. So what made you think there would be a change in the auction Why did you think it would be extraordinary
Palisena: As I explained to you earlier my lord, I was basing my rationalisation on several factors. There was a large government borrowing requirement. Then there was a telephone call from the Central Bank.The call was made by Tyrell Gunatilake who was at the Public Debt Department. He canvassed the 30 year Treasury bond to us. It established the fact that the government was desperate for money. Then of course I knew the government has not raised a single rupee via auction from December 2014 up until then. PTL was interested in investing in 30 year Treasury bonds. The government has used reserves for payments for the sovereign bonds.The prevailing Treasury bond rates were not a correct reflection of the actual market. We (PTL) were a Price Maker. At every prior 30 year bond issuance we have always bid over 11.00% rate. So I took the decision to bid above the 11.00% rate at the February 27, 2015 auction.
Commissioner Jayawardena: Now, there was only Rs 1 billion advertised. There was a new governor, and of course there was a new Superintendent of Public Debt. These were the only changes that have taken place up to February 27, 2015. Up until the said date, the practice was raising money through private placements.Auction was only to test the waters. I am not saying it was a good system. In fact there were lots of shortcomings in it. But that was what was available. So what made you think that the Central Bank will accept large volumes of bids at this auction Why bid up to Rs 13.5 billion
Palisena: Rs 500 million worth Sovereign bonds were paid using reserves.We didnt see a FD payment, without raising a rupee. That is why I am saying the auction was extraordinary. But I did not mean it to be this February 27, 2015 auction. I was not specific on the date.
Commissioner Jayawardena: I still cannot see a justifiable reason of any use to bid as much as Rs 13.5 billion. I cannot see anything reasonable on the table.
Palisena: It all boils down to the yield my lord. I see PDD canvassing for a 30 year bond, government desperate for money. Then I offer my rate adding a premium.
Commissioner Jayawardena: Why would you think more than Rs 1 billion will be accepted when the practice was otherwise
Palisena: I have seen Central Bank offered lower and accepted for higher. And it was quite evident that the government was desperate for money.
Justice Jayawardena: So you thought the Central Bank will do away with direct placement and accept your high rates
Palisena: I didnt think the direct placement method will be stopped.
Initially, mapping out reasons for PTL bidding aggressively at the questioned bond auction, Palisena told a Rs. 300 billion government borrowing requirement as at February 2015 compelled him to bid ten times the 1 billion worth of bonds advertised by the Central Bank on February 25, 2015.
According to Palisena, Rs. 300 billion borrowing requirement included,a total payment for maturing Treasury bonds and bills worth Rs. 212 billion, Sovereign bonds maturing worth Rs. 500 million, IMF trans-repayment from January-February 2015 worth Rs. 6.6 billion and allocations for the mini budget worth roughly a 52 billion.
At the initial stage of questioning, Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena to explain the portfolio of Perpetual Treasuries Limited as at February 2015.
According to the answers given by Palisena, by September 2014 PTL had 7.5 billion worth Treasury bonds and bills which the PTL liquidated in 12 November 2014. As at 31 December 2014, the PTL had 2.8 billion holding of Treasury bill and bonds. As at 31 January 2015, PTL has held 3.5 billion worth Treasury bills and bonds.
So, in those circumstances, what could have prompted you to bid for 13.5 billion worth Treasury bonds Justice Jayawardena asked. Palisena said he was well aware of the large borrowing requirement of the government.
Justice Jayawardena then asked Palisena if it was prudent to bid for Rs 13.5 billion with only a Rs. 1.40 billion capital as at February 27, 2015. Palisena said he could have held on to his portfolio if they wanted to and thereby settled the dues.
He also went on to say that he had other mechanisms in his hands if there were any difficulty to pay for the bids.
So what is this other mechanism you are talking about Justice Jayawardena asked.
I had selling and buying mechanism. We do sales with the promise of buying back. Palisena said. Isnt it a repo Justice Jayawardena questioned back.
Actually it is like a classic repo. It is a tool that I have used before. I had about three investment banks and two Primary Dealers who were willing to make actual repos with us. I previously did a Rs 190 billion actual repo with Bank of Ceylon. Palisena explained.
Isnt this acual repo is like an outright sale A holding of temporary arrangement Justice Jayawardena asked, to which Palisena answered in the affirmative.
Justice Jayawardena then went on to ask whether Palisena discussed about these TOM payments before 27 February 2015. No, I did not. But I had them readily available. Palisena said.
On the request of Justice Jayawardena, Palisena named the companies who were ready to sell and buy back with PTL.
I had NDB Wealth Management, Bank of Ceylon, Wealth Trust Securities, DFCC, First Capital, Cey Bank Asset Management. We called this Over Night Asset Facility or a swop. Palisena explained.
Does this mean these dealers will park money with you without parking money at the Central Bank overnight facility because they get a better return Justice Jayawardena asked, to which Palisena answered in the affirmative.
So on what basis could you be confident you could raise about Rs 10 billion within a short period of time Justice Jayawardena asked. So you had not discussed about such sale and buy arrangement before hand he continued. Palisena said he did not have prior arrangements and said he was confident he could have settled the Rs15 billion bids if they were accepted on that day.
Palisena went on to say that if by any chance the PTL had received inside information on the questioned auction, they would not have bidded at that auction at all. Palisena said they would have waited for the next auction of which the yield rate will be higher. Justice Jayawardena pointed out that, if such information was with PTL and all their Rs 15 billion bids were accepted, You could have closed down your shop, gone home and wait for the money comes as the interest for the large volume.
Palisenas testimony will continue today. (10)

CEAT Kelani Holdings honours top dealers at Shangri La Hambantota
The beauty and harmony evoked by the name Shangri La was much in evidence when one of Sri Lankas leading tyre brand CEAT recently felicitated top dealers at an entertainment-filled weekend at the Hambantota resort and spa of the same name.
The top 125 dealers, their spouses and children were hosted by CEAT Kelani Holdings in acknowledgement of their contribution to the CEAT brands continuing market leadership in2016-17across multiple tyre categories in the domestic market.
This was the companys first dealer awards event at a Sri Lankan venue in four years.
The last three such events were held in Rome, Singapore and Malaysia.
Speaking at the gala awards ceremony at the Shangri La ballroom, CEAT Kelani Managing Director Vijay Gambhire said the company takes great pride in its achievements in the last financial year, especially because it was a period of challenge due to an economic slowdown, natural disasters, escalation of raw material costs and depreciation of the Rupee.

CNCI says removal of CESS will be the end of local industry
The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI), the only Industrial chamber representing the industries in both service and manufacturing sectors, perceives an unhealthy future for Sri Lankan industries. Specially the proposed removal of import as well as export CESS will have a terrific drawback to all the local industries.
The CNCI has a membership of over 300 manufacturing organizations some of whom are market leaders in their respective sectors. However, almost all of the Sri Lankan industries find it not easy to compete with the products of countries doing mass scale production in the face of our high cost of production owing to lack of macroeconomic policies such as interest rates, rupee depreciation, low scale production, high cost of ethical labour etc. In this sense, the only safety net that local industrialists have is the cover imposed by means of CESS levy.
CESS levy or similar tools are used by developing countries to nurture local industry to reach greater heights after serving the local market successfully. CNCI says , We can sight so many local industries that have reached greater height especially due to the CESS levy.
When restrictions of imposing similar border levies are removed to facilitate specially the trade agreements, most of the countries start adopting various other non tariff barriers and duty draw backs.
In addition economically able countries adopts anti-dumping regulations, quality controls, labeling systems, hygienic needs etc.
Some of which do not apply to locally manufactured products. We do not have an Industrial Policy and standard systems that could boost oureconomy and imports on quality parameters which are essential to overcome dumping of inferior quality and substandard goods and unethical business practices. At a situation where these policies and sound monitoring systems are not in practice , if the CESS is also removed Sri Lanka will soon become a dumping yard for poor quality inferior productions.
On the other hand, removal of CESS against imports will deprive the nation of valuable funding for local industries existed for more than three decades. The main purpose of imposing CESS on imports is not merely to control imported products, but as one of the means of generating revenue to the state in order to develop the relevant sectors in a manner that they will be able to compete with the products penetrating into our market. Many developed countries including India had close door policy with strict restriction on imports and thereby giving breathing space to develop the local industry and encouraged them to export by giving various incentives such as export tax, investment rebates etc.
Export CESS is also equally important to boost the utilizing of local raw material to add value and create employment.
We certainly need to discourage export of basic raw materials or raw material that has the potential of value addition. It is foolish to allow export of valuable raw material without any value addition and allow another country to get the advantage of having basic raw material at very low prices. We must be able to encourage local industries to add that value here.It has helped us to earn more foreign exchange, employment generation and many other benefits for the development of the country. In this way CESS was playing a very voluble part to encourage this valuable economic process.
Today total business community is very much disturbed and rallying round the chambers expecting the Chambers liaison with the authorities to get their respective industries protected mainly due to our scale of operation.
As Chambers we anticipate the government to discuss in detail matters related to the industry and to look for proper policies that will bring prosperity to the country in the long term.
The CNCI, being the Chamber for industries in the country, earnestly requests the government not to remove the CESS levy without proper evaluation of the total outcome that can lead to elimination of local industry in the near future.

Developing Asia to post slowest growth in 16 years
The rebalancing of Chinas economy and policy uncertainty in advanced economies means developing Asia could record its slowest annual growth in 16 years, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank said in its annual outlook.
Developing Asia, which comprises 45 countries in the Asia Pacific, will expand 5.7 per cent in 2017 and 2018, a slight deceleration from the 5.8 per cent posted in 2016, according to the ADBs latest Asian Development Outlook, released on Thursday.
The forecast by the bank is the weakest for the region since it grew 5 per cent in 2001.
The region remains the largest single contributor to global growth, at 60 per cent, the report shows. Growth is recorded as picking up in two-thirds of economies in developing Asia, supported by higher external demand, rebounding global commodity prices, and domestic reforms.
Developing Asia continues to drive the global economy even as the region adjusts to a more consumption-driven economy in the Peoples Republic of China and looming global risks, said Yasuyuki Sawada, the ADBs chief economist.
While uncertain policy changes in advanced economies do pose a risk to the outlook, we feel that most economies are well positioned to weather potential short-term shocks, said Sawada.
Growth in China, the worlds second largest economy, continues to moderate as the government implements measures to move the economy towards a more consumption-driven model.
Overall output is expected to slow to 6.5 per cent in 2017 and 6.2 per cent in 2018, down from 2016s 6.7 per cent. Efforts to maintain financial and fiscal stability will continue to be a modest drag on growth going forward, but continued structural reform will help to maintain growth in the governments target range.

Did SriLankan err in suspending Frankfurt operations
SriLankan Airlines has made a big blunder by suspending flights to Frankfurt, said former youngest freight service manager at Sri Lankan Airlines Frankfurt Airport, Hiran Houx. Houx who served at the Frankfurt office for more than a decade said that one of the main reasons for the suspension of the Colombo- Frankfurt flight was the losses the airline suffered.
However this route can and could have been a very profitable route if there was a focused marketing campaign launched in Germany.
He said that Germany is among the top four tourist arrival destinations for Sri Lanka and this route should have being nursed with more focus without suspending it.
Tourists like to take a direct seven-hour flight and reach their destination rather than transiting for hours and spending half a day to reach their destination.
He also said that some times SriLankan fares were cheaper than the competitors but passengers did not know about it.
Houx said that the cargo advantage the airline had too been underutilized.
Sri Lankan suspended operations to Paris and Frankfurt from Winter 2016 as part of its restructuring plan.
SriLankan operates daily flights to both Doha and Abu Dhabi and has a strong codesharing partnership with Etihad and Qatar through which it will continue to provide onward connectivity to European destinations it has been serving via Paris and Frankfurt, the airline said.
The airline said that the route network is being continuously evaluated in the context of changing market dynamics in order to maximize on sustainable routes which bring in more contribution towards the bottom line. Haux said that there was an instance where a SriLankan flight from Frankfurt to Colombo flew empty due to industrial action at the Frankfurt airport.
This is a clear example of mismanagement. The best way out of this was to land the Frankfurt-bound SriLankan flight in Dusseldorf airport which was just two hours away and transport passengers and cargo overland.
This is what the other airlines did and none of their flights went back empty. Houx after retiring from SriLankan now owns and runs CISMAT GmbH in Germany  a general sales service agency for air cargo with offices in several European countries. CISMAT is administered by a staff of 16 with an annual turnover of 46 million euros.
CISMAT also has a branch network in Austria, Vienna, Romania, India and Sri Lanka. In addition Houx also owns and operates the four star 48-key Araliya Resort and Spa Bentota.

Senior journalist, sportsman, musician, culinary expert and raconteur, Peter Christie passed away last Thursday in London after a brief illness. He was 71.
A colourful, multi-talented figure, there was never a dull moment when Peter was around in the news rooms of the Daily News where he had his last stint as a journalist before migrating to Old Blighty. He could keep an audience regaled by his anecdotes which were invariably of his own making and had his own brand of swearwords which were the stock in trade in Kotahena where he resided most of his life.
As a journalist, Peter was in a class of his own and garnished his copies with a vocabulary which only he was capable of conjuring, especially as parliamentary lobby correspondent, where he brought forth his talent in ample measure.
When Peter was around, the corridors of Lake House always reverberated with his loud mouthed banter, bringing peels of laughter in those at the receiving end of his peculiar brand of humour displayed with little or no finesse.
Peter will be missed by his colleagues in all the newspaper houses he worked for and which he enlivened, as only he was capable of. - Rodney

First trilingual digital insurance agent 'Amaya' launched
Saveyourmonkey.com, Sri Lanka's pioneering Insurtech startup which began operations earlier this year, announced their official launch following the trilingual launch of Sri Lanka's first Digital Insurance Agent, Amaya'.
The startup aims to change the traditional perception of procuring an insurance policy as being a tedious legal obligation via digitalization, and tested its platform and new ideas such as Amaya in the market following the soft launch in February this year.
Amaya, the innovative brainchild of the Save Your Monkey team, was initially developed in English and is the first of its kind insurance chatbot in the South Asian Region. Amaya is a fun and easy way for customers to choose their insurance policy online and became immensely popular among users over the last few months while still at its testing stage.
Save Your Monkey predicts rapid digitalization of the insurance industry in near future.
Following this wide spread interest, the saveyourmonkey.com team jumped to action and worked to launch the Amaya in all three languages to make it relevant and accessible to all Sri Lankans.
Speaking on the official launch of saveyourmonkey.com and the latest development with Amaya, Chathura Jayatissa, Founder and CEO of saveyourmonkey.com said, 'As we launch officially, we have made it our mission to change the public perception that procuring an insurance is a tedious task.
Amaya was designed using AI (Artificial Intelligence) components to respond to customer inquiries effectively and provide them with the best advice for their requirements. We named the chatbot Amaya in order to make our customers feel at ease and to make them feel like they are chatting to a friend. With the AI components at work, Amaya interacts with customers as an actual person and thus quickly became popular among our customers.'
Amaya is a first of its kind not only in Sri Lanka but also in the region. While the rest of the world has experienced rapid technological advancements in the insurance industry, things have been slow to progress in this part of the world.
'That's why we wanted to introduce the digital revolution to the insurance industry in Sri Lanka. Because of the tedious process of procuring and the confusion that always surrounds insurance, many tend to overlook the value and purpose of an insurance policy.
As Amaya has already borne testimony, we are confident that our tech based solutions will introduce a more customer-centric and cost effective approach to the conventional insurance business. We are happy to be at the forefront of this change,' added Jayatissa.
Saveyoumonkey.com is the creation of three young entrepreneurs driven by a genuine passion to make an impact. With the clear vision of transforming Sri Lanka's insurance industry into a more technologically advanced and progressive industry, they have already introduced a number of new innovations and reveal that much more is in the pipeline.
Their Road Side Assistance App which is another first in the industry is one such product that is soon to be launched.

'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'  is already in works
Marvel fans, rejoice! You may get the third part of 'Guardians of the Galaxy' really soon. Writer-director James Gunn is hard at work penning 'Guardians Vol. 3', while also helping Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige plot out the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's cosmic properties.
He said, "Those scripts are already in the works. Kevin and I talk about it all the time, we just had a meeting today. Discussing what is the next iteration of cosmic characters and where are the characters that we've already created going to go in the next batch of films."
Vol. 3 will also be the end of this current lineup of Guardians, begging the question of whether the Ravagers led by Sylvester Stallone in Vol. 2 movie could pick up the Guardians mantle. "I'm definitely interested in the direction that these characters are headed and their roles in the Marvel Universe," said Gunn.
Though, the Guardians have some wild origins that include time travel (they are from 1,000 years in the future), but Gunn noted that Marvel is not planning on going that route. Gunn explained, "That is not something that we're dealing with. These are older characters and more criminal than our Guardians. So we're focusing on that."
The director also shared that he always does what is best for the movie and also changes some things from the source material. Gunn also said he has selected all the songs for Vol. 3 and they're surprisingly different than the first two films.
"Vol. 1 was a playlist of Meredith Quill's songs, where as Vol. 2 contained Yondu's songs," he shared.

Guide to: studying architecture
For many years now the Moratuwa Department of Architecture has been producing Architects of top quality, some of the finest architects in the industry. ArchWorld speaks to University of Moratuwa, Department of Architecture, Senior Lecturer N.H.D. De Silva on an academics view point on how the field is developing at the student level. De Silva has been teaching for 15 years.
When you take Architecture, this is a profession and there is a long journey to become an Architect. It is a minimum of 8 years. Hence it is very much more than listening to clients and providing spaces. The architect who runs an architectural business carries the authority, responsibility and accountability for the work which is placed with him by his clients  we train students for this goal, said De Silva.
When it comes to moulding young minds, for this experience and maturity matters.
At the Faculty of Architecture, there are few departments. But in Department of Architecture we take about 55 to 60 students for Architecture and about 40 students for Landscape Architecture.
Students who have passed there A/Ls could apply for the aptitude test conducted by University of Moratuwa. Normally about 3000 students sit for this aptitude test and the Department of Architecture will be selecting about 100 to 150 students based on their marks. This list will be forwarded to UGC (university grants commission). UGC will be sending the final list of students to Moratuwa University based on their Z score, explained De Silva
Standards
According to our governing body of SLIA Architectural education shall ensure that all students have competence in Architectural design, which shall include technical systems, requirements, rules, regulations, standards in terms of health and safety. Further they shall understand the cultural, historical, social, economic and environment context for Architecture; and that they comprehend the Architects role and responsibilities in society.
Thus understanding your own culture, rituals, behavior, way of living - basically to keep your ears and eyes open for everything is vital. Grasping the uniqueness which may not be understood or perceived by a normal layman. For me it is very critical that during their studies, students go out of the studios and gain experience, stated De Silva.
As in any discipline the students need to be prepared for the world outside
Once you become an Architect for any project, the client relies on the architects experience, judgment and integrity/honesty in the discharge of his/her work. To do this in small scale or big scale we need to train students accordingly. Consequently throughout their 5 years we expose students to practical or real world situations. Most of their designs projects are developed based on real time circumstances or current/ national/ international issues to be addressed by an Architecture student. Lecturers work really hard in developing these projects to cover up all the requirements to be fulfilled by the students. They handle major practical design projects in their 3rd year MDP and 5th year CDP, elucidated De Silva.
Excellent and final design evaluation is done by international and local panel. Maintaining requires RIBA standards.
Subjects
When it comes to the subjects taught at the University of Moratuwa, it is a very long list and mainly those subjects cover up all the avenues and possibilities needed as an academic to become a fully-fledged Architect. Those syllabuses are validated by Royal Institute of British Architects every 5 years. The fundamental requirements to be in the profession shall be the skills and abilities which shall be mastered through education, training, and experience, added De Silva.
Most students love design projects.
We train students for 5 years and they go out for their practical experience and professional exams to become a Chartered Architect. After becoming a chartered Architect, opting for another profession is very remote. But this is my personal view.
As a senior lecturer I feel the syllabus is not heavy but comprehensive. We are training professionals. Required standards need to be maintained. The fundamental requirements to be in the profession shall be the skills and abilities which shall be mastered through education, training, and experience, verified by written and oral examination, informed De Silva.
For the lecturers at the Architecture Department of Moratuwa, teaching architecture is a passion.
Architecture is anyway a matchless profession. Until today I have never felt it uninteresting or I have never been tired in my practice. Teaching Architecture is a privilege. Further if you could teach something to somebody, I feel it is a blessing. So I am thoroughly honored to teach Architecture, my own profession to students at a leading university, summed up De Silva.

Hambantota Rajya Osusala promoting private sector drugs
The Hambantota Rajya Osusala is promoting drugs imported by private drug importers although the motive of the Rajya Osusala is to promote drugs imported or manufactured by the State Pharmaceutical Corporation, the people of the area said. When a prescription is produced to a pharmacist at the Osusala, the pharmacist first quotes the prices of the private sector drugs instead of quoting the prices of the drugs imported by the State Pharmaceutical Corporation. 
The corporation set up the Osusalas to provide drugs and medicines to patients at reasonable rates to prevent pharmacy owners from fleecing the patients.

Harin's lament
The Yahapalnaya government is hoist with its own petard. At least that is what minister Harin Fernando is convinced of. All guns are being trained on the government instead of the other way around targeting the Rajapaksas, their cronies and kith and kin. The Joint Opposition is rubbing its hands with glee. Earlier it was the JO members who were being paraded before various investigative bodies. Now tables are turned, with ministers of the Yahapalanaya government made to stand in the dock before a Special Presidential Commission. At least the JO members who were hauled before the FCID and courts were not humiliated. At worst, they were bundled into prison vans and taken away amidst the cheers of their supporters. But in the present scenario a government minister has not only come under incisive questioning by the government's own legal team, read the Attorney General's Department. He is also faced with the grim prospect of losing his portfolio, and that too after only two years in office. No wonder Minister Fernando is bitter.
Addressing a media conference at the Government Information Department Harin Fernando said he would be requesting President Maithripala Sirisena to set up a similar commission, on the lines of the Special Presidential Commission probing the Bond scam, to probe the mega corruption indulged in by members of the Rajapaksa regime, who, he said, were today posing as paragons of virtue and has the gumption to point the finger at Yahapalanaya functionaries. A highly dejected and demoralized Fernando said that, today, those who had engaged in large scale corruption had taken the moral high ground and were gunning for members of the Yahapalanaya government as a result of the mechanism set in motion by the President to probe corruption under the present regime. These elements, he said, who should have been behind bars two years ago were today roaming free, assuming the role of crusaders against corruption. A highly disconsolate Fernando said the government they created with great sacrifice, even risking their lives, had today become a boomerang against its own members.
Minister Fernando, no doubt, is justified in his lamentation. Being the catalyst that rallied the hitherto dormant opposition against the Rajapaksa juggernaut by his great showing at the Uva Provincial Council election, that, no doubt, precipitated a mass wave against the oppressive regime, he naturally has regrets at the way things have panned out, where, the hunter has become the hunted, so to speak. The Joint Opposition appears to be gung-ho, and is going hammer and tongs to drive it into the public psyche that the government was corrupt to the core, and, is using the Ravi Karunanayake affair to buttress its claim. The notion also is being created that allegations leveled against Rajapaksas carried no weight and was made with the intention to grab power. The fact that not a single big time swindler of the last government had been brought to book up to date too has gone a long way to give credence to this claim and has planted the seed of doubt in the public mind.
That fact that the Attorney General's Department is carrying out its task with extraordinary zeal, in grilling members of the government is lost on the public, which is what is obviously galling to government ministers like Harin Fernando. Hence, his request to the President to employ the same mechanism to round up the mega corrupt in the Rajapaksa government is indeed justified. A similar Presidential Commission was appointed at the very outset of his regime by JRJ to probe corruption under the 70-77 United Front government, the outcome of which saw Sirima Bandaranaike lose her civic rights. But, two and half years into his Presidency, President Sirisena had appointed a commission to probe members of his own government, which may be another reason that has riled Harin Fernando.
While it is true that such a commission cannot be selective and should even probe corruption within government, the very fact that this has paved the way for the corrupt elements under Rajapaksa to gain political ascendancy, riding on the findings of such a commission, could be another reason for the frustration of the likes of Minister Fernando.
Indeed, there is enough and more material, sufficient for a dozen Presidential Commissions to probe, during the 10 year tenure of the Rajapaksas, which have all gone by default due to the lackadaisical approach displayed by the Yahapalanaya government, in violation of its mandate. The hedging deal, the Greek Bond issue, the white elephants such as Mattala, Sooriyawewa Cricket stadium, the running to the ground of the national carrier, the astronomical amounts paid to PR firms in the US to promote Sri Lanka when there was an ambassador entrusted with the task, wasteful expenditure in the promotion of Hambantota as a venue for the Commonwealth Games, inflated estimates in the construction of highways, the billions ripped off in the purchase of aircraft, to name only a few, no doubt, would far exceed anything that the alleged Bond scam had lost for the country's economy.

Haycarb records Rs 3.3 bn turnover of Rs 3.3 bn, PBT of Rs 151 million for 1Q 2017/18
The Sri Lankan multinational Haycarb PLC reported revenue of Rs. 3.3 billion and profit before tax of Rs 151 million for the first quarter of 2017/18. The profit after tax stood at Rs. 121 million.
Haycarb PLC Managing Director Rajitha Kariyawasan said that while the companys initiatives to increase throughput and the value added portfolio together with the geographical expansion of export markets contributed to the growth in turnover, the challenges faced in Indonesian operations due to the shortages in raw material supply and resultant high prices and the increases in charcoal prices in Sri Lanka, India and Thailand negatively impacted the Groups profitability.
He further said, Shortages and price increases in coconut shell based charcoal supplies are expected to continue through the current financial year in all the key coconut producing countries in Asia.
The challenge in passing its full cost impact to end customers is a major concern to maintain activated carbon business expected margins through the year.
The Company is in the process of reviewing its prices to pass on a fair part of this impact to its customers after extensive discussions. Central and country specific management teams are working aggressively to ensure a secure supply chain in the current adverse situation whilst focusing on controlling costs and improving efficiencies through the Lean Manufacturing platform. Haycarbs reputation to manage difficult supply chain issues effectively, without interruption of deliveries to its valued customers is well demonstrated by example in the past.
On a separate note, Kariyawasan said that the growth in the environmental engineering arm Puritas (Pvt.) Ltd. is expected to contribute positively to the profitability of the Group.
In the background of increasing emphasis on environmental sustainability worldwide, Haycarb remains positive in its medium to long term outlook in its activated carbon and water treatment systems businesses.

The Computer Society of Sri Lanka (CSSL) has assembled an impressive line-up of speakers for the upcoming NITC 2017 (National IT Conference), which is being held in conjunction with the IFIP General Assembly and SEARCC Conference.
With around 100 prominent experts visiting Colombo for the international events, CSSL has taken the opportunity to draw on the significant pool of international talent to offer delegates unprecedented access to thought leaders from around the globe.
CSSL President Yasas Vishuddhi Abeywickrama is predicting record attendances at the combined events, eclipsing the 1,000 ICT professionals, researchers and academics who attended NITC last year.
Given the calibre of international speakers weve been able to attract and the significant opportunities to network and form valuable business connections, we expect this event to be a significant focus for the local ICT community, he said.
International speakers include: President of SEARCC and Adjunct Professor at the University of Queensland, Dr Nick Tate; Vice President of the British Computer Society, Professor Tom Crick of Cardiff Metropolitan University; IFIP IP3 Chair and former Australian Computer Society President, Brenda Aynsley; IFIP Vice President, Dr Yuko Murayama of Japan; Dr Gabriela Marin Raventos of the University of Costa Rica; Professor Kai Rannenberg of Goethe University in Frankfurt, and many more.
The five-day program includes the two-day NITC/SEARCC (South East Asian Regional Computer Confederation) conference on 14-15 September, preceded by three days of invitation-only meetings for the IFIP General Assembly, its various committees and SEARCC Executive Committee.
The confirmed guest list currently includes representatives from almost 50 nations so this is really an opportunity to showcase Sri Lankan ICT to the world, said Abeywickrama.
Weve scheduled several networking and social events such as the International ICT Gala Dinner and presentation of the CSSL Awards, SEARCC International Awards and International Schools Software Competition Awards, along with various lunches and morning/afternoon teas to give delegates numerous chances to connect with our international visitors, he said.
This is definitely going to be the biggest ICT event, in terms of the breadth and diversity of representation that Sri Lanka has even seen. The Sri Lankan Government has been quick to recognise the significance of this opportunity with both the ICT Agency and Sri Lanka Tourism coming on board as partners.
Were delighted to have that level of support and involvement from the Government and are optimistic this event will bring important new knowledge and connections to Sri Lanka.

India interested in developing Mattala Airport

The Government of India (GOI) has expressed interest in developing the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA).
According to a cabinet paper submitted by Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Nimal Siripala de Silva, the Government of India had sent a proposal in May 2017 to form a joint venture company between GOI or its assigned entity and Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) or its assigned entity for the operation of MRIA on the basis of sharing of equity at the ratio of 70:30 for 40 years.
The Indian have also shown interest to operate, manage, maintain and develop MRIA with and not limited to commercial aviation, aircraft maintenance repair and overhaul, flying school, etc...
They are willing to invest USD 205 million as their equity share and GOSL is to share the balance of USD 88 million totalling to USD 293 million as per their valuation of assets of MRIA.
The Minister has asked Cabinet to further study the proposal and evaluate it based on the re-valuation of the assets and lease value of the land in Mattala, to appoint a Cabinet Appointed Negotiation Committee (CANC) assisted by a Project Committee to evaluate the proposal and to make recommendations to Cabinet.
The Minister has also proposed that they continue to look at other proposals in the meantime.

Insightful shots
His pen spelt success. Young screenwriter Thivanka Rukshan Pereras Silent Letter won the Best Short Film (debut) award at the Whatashort Independent International Film Festival held in New Delhi, India, last month. He won the award for his work out of over 400 entries from 34 countries. Directed by seasoned actor Kamal Addararachchi, the script and production of the short film was by Thivanka. The story rotates around a low caste young lad to tries to escape into the city life and meets devastating consequences.
This was not the first time that Silent Letter has made it to the spotlight. It was picked for distribution by Shorts International and was broadcast in USA this year. It also clinched a certificate of excellence at the Fifth Mumbai Shorts International Film Festival in Mumbai, India, last year.
Though he won the award for his scrip Thivanka himself has directed several productions focusing on natural history. These include Sri Lankan Jungle Fowl, 2016 Demo Reel, The Devil Bird of Sri Lanka and Brown Wood Owl  Juveniles Journey. All these have gone viral and have been viewed by many. The Devil Bird of Sri Lanka has earning him around 95, 000 views on YouTube.
A graduate of Academy of Art University, San Francisco, USA, with a major in screenwriting, Thivanka has done his foundation in communications in Malaysia in 2010.
Though he is not a writer, my father, Dr Mahendra Perera, a Cancer Oncologist, is heavily into arts. I began my writing stint with poetry and gradually got into the visual medium via screenwriting. Screenwriting is more of a passionable pursuit rather than a lucrative venture. Though I hope to engage in another profession I wish to move into this field full time gradually, said the old boy of at St Josephs College, Maradana.
Thivanka has authored several screenplays that were nominated for globally renowned contests such as the Michael Collyer Memorial Fellowship in Screenwriting, where his spec Bird of Prey reached the finals making it to the top three in 2016. Black Leopard was included in the Hot 100 list of screenplays compiled by the Capital Fund Screenplay Competition in 2017. His screenplays have also been recognized by competitions such as Francis Ford Coppolas Zoetrope Screenwriting Contest, Script Pipeline and The World Series of Screenwriting.
Bird of Prey was based on three wildlife documentaries I did: The Devil Bird of Sri Lanka, Brown Wood Owl and For Devils Sake: Owls of Sri Lanka. It was the first feature screenplay I scripted. One of the challenges we face in this field is that we do not have producers to produce the scripts. One means of getting your work noted is to submit it to international screenwriting competitions. If your script turns out to be the winner, your work would be picked up by producers and directors, Thivanka explained.
He notes that wildlife naturalist and a painter Lester Perera has been very helpful during the making of his documentaries. The cinematographer was Dhanuska Bandara. The Devil Bird of Sri Lanka was shot at the Dehiwala Zoo while the Brown Wood Owl was captured in a rubber plantation in Kegalle.
We have many people coming to Sri Lanka to capture the natural geographic elements here. I realized that we can do a better job than them because have access to everything within reach. One of the difficulties I faced while directing the bird series was trying to find out when the birds will be present. We had to rely on the trackers who would scout the jungles and inform us the whereabouts of the birds. Then we would pack our bags and scurry to the place to capture them in action, he noted adding that unlike projects which involve telling a tale using actors, the schedule in these sort of documentaries is unpredictable.
His second screenplay for a feature film titled Man Eater is currently under discussion to be directed by Chandran Rutnam. Speaking about his award winning production, Silent Letter Thivanka said that he had developed the storyline while he was schooling in 2012.
I used to visit my mother, Rupika Pereras home town, Kegalle, and saw the peoples way of life over there. Sidney Chandrasekara is my fathers friend. He recommended Kamal Addararachchi to do the directing because he saw directing abilities in him. Silent Letter was the first time Addararachchi had tried his hand at directing, Thivanka said.
Silent Letter runs for 23 minutes. Two small boys who have never faced a camera before portray the main roles. They were selected from an orphanage in Nugegoda and had to go through a training session and an audition before taking on their roles. Many veteran actors like Sweenitha Weerasinghe, Jagath Benaragama, Lukshman Mendis, Mahinda Pathirage and others have acted in the production.
Directing was difficult because the protagonists were new comers. At times we had to change the dialogs on the spot. We took about 20 takes for one scene once, he recalled the difficulties the team faced while shooting Silent Letter.
Thivanka admires American filmmaker Sam Peckinpahs westerns. He has a special liking for Indian short films as he says that they have great storylines.
He had just finished penning another short film script which centers on a cobblers son. The project is titled Cobblers Son Wears No Shoes and he is looking for a director to make the short film. The story is about a cobbler who tries to keep the memory of his wife alive by making his son wear the same pair of shoes without mending or buying a new pair for him.
This award motivated me to create a collection of short films by different directors and have them distributed worldwide to show the public that we have a good storytelling culture in Sri Lanka. My experience abroad made me realize that there arent many short films coming from Sri Lanka. I wanted to fill that void, he pointed out.
His message to other youth is to keep pursuing their dreams.
Learn to accept criticism as well. You get a lot of criticism of this when you are writing the screenplay. Do not take things personally but use them to develop your own projects. The you will be able to move forward, he advised.

If you dont invest you will vanish, if you invest you survive he pointed out.
While drawing attention on the Sri Lankan tea industry, the Prime Minister said that modernisation was started in 1835 first in Asia. With the modernisation moves, tea industry benefited for many parts of the country.The tea industry created a strong and wealthy Sri Lankan middleclass and need to invest elsewhere.
When a new Government formed under late President J.R. Jayewardene in 1977, the tea industry completely changed. Under that government millions of money invested in the plantation sector especially in tea plantation and estate sector. Under that government, infrastructure was mooted. Those investments made the way for plantations industry to move on and acquire a radical change.
The tea smallholders were encouraged to enter into tea industry and it resulted that many people in Sabaragamuwa and Southern parts of the country to enter the tea industry. The tea industry was modernised after 70th and 80th decades he said.
Finally 70 per cent of the tea production is coming from tea smallholders while only 30 per cent comes from mega scale tea companies.The value addition ratio is 40 per cent of the total production. This is a result of nationsation and the development of the tea industry under the 1977 government. After 1977 the plantation industry was subjected to a radical and speedy development.
The Prime Minister pointed out that the Colombo tea auction is the oldest continuous tea auction in the world.Tea production has doubled from 1995 to 2015. But at the same time the gap between the production and the consumption has increased. Instead of the surplus in the market, consumption has also increased.Tea exports as a percentage of the Global tea production has gone down from 43 per cent in 2006 and 34 per cent in 2015. However tea consumption in India and China has gone up.
While focussing on the future of the industry, when considering the population growth in 2050 of the additional 2 billion people to the world population he said that various subsidiary drinks are coming in to take the place of tea. But are we ready to compete with these alternative drinks, he queried.
Online marketing as a new system of tea action may shift to the industry.Colombo tea traders have to think of online marketing and trading.The system of supply chain and sales system will also change in the future.
Then it is needless to supply tea in the traditional way in a tea cup he said. What is the technology to have new products. Attention should be drawn on the new ways and methods of the tea industry to meet the demands of the market by 2050 he said.
But by 2050 many people will move to service and industry sector. Then there will be a dearth in labour, he said while focussing his attention on the future demands and the threats of the tea industry.
We have to rapidly increase the value added percentage of our total tea production. We have to go for new method of promoting and marketing while thinking outside the box. It is needed more and more investments. It is important to welcome foreign investments if the local investment is not sufficient. If you dont invest you will destroy, if you invest you will survive. There is only one market for tea.It is global tea market the Prime Minister said.

Professor Dharmasiri together with the newly elected Executive Council while continuing with the many new important programs that were implemented during the previous year, has plans to embark upon many new initiatives and programs to take IPM as well as the HR fraternity to greater heights.
This gives us the opportunity to continue with the momentum and synergy achieved during the past year to continue on the journey of taking IPM Sri Lanka and the HR fraternity to greater heights said Prof. Dharmasiri.
We were able to achieve significant milestones during the past year specifically in the areas of capacity building, enhancing connections and communications, guidelines for good conduct of HR professionals and to bring about coherence in all activities carried out by IPM he added.
IPM was founded in 1959 and was subsequently incorporated by an Act of Parliament in 1976.

The Charter status of IPM Sri Lanka (CIPM) will help to build capacity and position Sri Lanka as an alternative regional capital to host international businesses and their regional offices. The Charter status is expected to be finalized and granted by an amendment to the relevant Act of Parliament in the near future.
Other initiatives in capacity building are the establishing of a separate Board of Management for the IPM Business School under a Director of Studies, strengthening research activities by the establishment of an IPM HRM Research Center, classifying the IPM Research Symposium as an annual event to encourage research based knowledge assimilation, and publication of the IPM HRM Perspectives magazine providing insights on HRM practices.

'Jab Harry Met Sejal' is not an intellectual masterpiece
Filmmaker Imtiaz Ali has brushed aside criticism that his "touch" was missing from 'Jab Harry Met Sejal', saying he never wanted praise for himself while making the movie.
"I am sure that a lot of people do not think that 'Harry Met Sejal' is an intellectual masterpiece, but I did not intend it to be one," Imtiaz Ali, a respected auteur known for his work in 'Jab We Met', 'Rockstar' and 'Highway', said in an interview.
The Shah Rukh Khan-Anushka Sharma starrer romcom has drawn flak from reviewers who have called the flick mushy and churned out from the same oven having typical "SRK romance" and bereft of any storyline.
Imtiaz, whose movies have a central theme of relationships and their vagaries, said he has never belonged to the "intelligent club" and always aimed at making this film for the masses.
"Some said you really need to be intelligent to understand an Imtiaz Ali film. For me that was a blow. I feel that I have never been part of any intelligent club. I wanted to make a very simple film with all my heart," Imtiaz said.
"I have not made this film for praise. You know I would like to be the director who can make different kinds of films. This one is made to reach the maximum number of people.
Not to just get praise for myself. I have been a veteran at this.
When 'Tamasha' released, lot of people praised the film but the film was not reaching the audience," Imtiaz added, answering a question about the reviews the 'JHMS' has got since its Friday release.
Shah Rukh, who worked with Imtiaz for the first time, echoed his director, saying the magic of 'Jab Harry Met Sejal' will take time to latch onto people.
"I have not seen Imtiaz Ali's previous work. I have always believed the film should go beyond the subject and create some magic.
I also believe people come with preconcieved notion that they have seen already," the 51-year old actor said.
"I am speaking on his (Imtiaz Ali's) behalf. I think sometimes the bigger feeling is to try something new.
I have been in the business long enough to try a formula film and to try a film with no formula." "Succeeded and failed at both.
So, I understood that I can't even try to recreate the magic. Take 'Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge', for example. I have worked with Adi (director Aditya Chopra) again.
Me and Anushka have (in 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi'). But there will never be another DDLJ," Shah Rukh explained.
The two-hour-twentyfour-minute film revolves around the two characters and how Sejal (Anushka) bumps into tour-guide Harry (Shah Rukh) and together they set off visiting the exact same spots that she and her family visited - in the hope of finding her lost engagement ring. IANS

JOs hypocrisy bared
Wimal and Gammanpila of the Joint Opposition who criticised the appointment of the Treasury Bond Commission by the President are going round the country carrying the commission's investigation reports on their shoulders, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said.
Addressing a meeting at the Bogamuwa Weheragoda Viharaya to mark the enshrining of sacred relics in a new chaitya build in the temple, Amaraweera said it was he who pointed out an alleged fraud at the Central Bank in issuing Treasury Bonds and lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission.
"When the Presidential Commission was appointed to investigate the bond issue, it was the Wimal-Gammanpila duo who started criticising it at the outset. Today, the whole country was talking about the disclosures made at the Bond Commission," Amaraweera said.
It was the good governance government which made the appointment of the commission and its investigations possible, he said.
"In contrast, acts of fraud and corruption went unnoticed during the past regime without any murmur or investigation," he said.
The good governance government would never safeguard wrong-doers among them. Any one involved in fraud and corruption would be punished disregarding his or her position or status.
"This is the policy adopted by the President," Minister Amaraweera said.
Amaraweera recalled that several officials who had allegations of fraud and corruption against them had been dismissed by the government. There was an independent judiciary today. The government would never interfere in the judicial process.
He said the new chaitya was built under the Wewak Samaga Gamak programme of the ministry.

LAVISH : IN LUSCIOUS LOCKS
Keeping your strands hydrated and smooth in the burning temperature is a difficult feat. Between chlorine, frizz and the tendency to plunge into salty beach waves, we are left with hair that is far from happy. Although we wash our locks, we might be making hair conditioning mistakes without even realizing it. This can happen especially when time is a factor. However keep in mind that conditioning plays a key role in owning a shiny and lustrous mane.
Types of conditioners
Surface conditioners  These add moisture to the surface of the hair and smoothens the cuticle scales. These can be used on normal hair.
Penetrating conditioners  These enter the hair shaft and help to repair the hair structure and strengthen the hair. These conditioners can be used on heat, chemically, or environmentally damaged hair.
Leave in conditioners  These products also make detangling easier and help tame frizz. Leave-in conditioners moisturize dry hair, and make it softer, smoother, and shinier. They serve as detanglers, stylers, and heat protectants. Leave-in conditioner is one of the most widely used hair products to protect curly hair from dryness.
Scalp treatments These are used to treat scalp conditions such as oily/dry scalps and dandruff.
Hair conditioner as a gel
You can apply a hair gel to dry hair to give added stiffness and substance, but if you apply a conditioner after drying, your hair will look greasy.
Hair conditioners are designed to coat the hair shaft and keep the hair soft and manageable. Styling gels on the other hand contain agents that coat the hair and give it added volume. Many gels contain adhesive agents which will make the hair stick together and give the style added strength to hold longer.
Conditioners are designed to be left on the hair for a short period of time and rinsed away. As the hair dries, it appears soft and shiny. Conditioners have a heavy consistency and can leave a greasy appearance if it is left on the hair.
Adding conditioner to dry hair would only make the hair wet. Therefore you cannot use a conditioner as a hair gel and get similar results. You can use conditioners on dry hair, but the results you get will be different than those achieved from gel.
Overusing conditioners
Although you cannot over-condition your hair, you should use conditioner as needed, as overuse could leave a lot of build-up on the hair.
How often you condition, how heavy a conditioner you use, and for how long you keep it on each time varies, depending on hair type. For someone with natural hair (no colour/straightening), they can condition less frequently than someone who colours their hair or does chemical services.
Too much moisturizer
You can actually over-moisturize your hair. This causes more harm than good. Overly soft hair that is breaking and won't style has too much moisture. Constantly spraying your hair with water, deep conditioning your hair well beyond the time recommended by the manufacturer or even overnight on a regular basis can cause over-moisturization. Too much moisture breaks down the proteins in your hair and causes over moisturized hair.
Detangling conditioner for unmanageable hair
Detangling conditioners are good options for either a rinse-through or leave-in formulas. Use conditioner just enough to coat the hair. Work it through carefully and then rinse it thoroughly with lukewarm water. The hair will become manageable and the frizz will be reduced.
Faster hair growth and adding volumes
Hair typically only grows about a half an inch per month. While shampoo alone cant determine the length or strength of your hair, having the right shampoo can help your hair grow longer and faster. Using nutritional shampoos which are rich in essential natural ingredients such as essential Aminos, Proteins and Vitamins will help to make hair grow faster.
Volume or volumizing shampoos make hair more bouncy and give it more body. Volumizing Shampoo amplifies fine, lifeless hair. Proteins and vitamins such as panthenol (vitamin B5) help to create body and fullness.
Adverse effects of shampoos and conditioners
Adverse reactions to shampoos and conditioners are rare. It is known that a pH higher than 5.5 may cause irritation of the scalp. If no conditioners are applied for protection and restoration, damage to hair shaft can occur if the wrong kind of shampoo is consistently applied with respect to the type of hair a person has.
Natural hair care results
There are a number of things we can do to strengthen our hair. Using natural treatments like oil (castor oil or coconut oil) is one such an example. There are several oils that you can use for hair growth and hair strength.
They contain numerous minerals and fatty acids.
You might not notice results immediately after washing.
However you should be able to see positive changes approximately within a month if these warmed oils are applied, and massaged on at least twice a week.

North Korea Guam missile strike plan 'ready by mid-August'

North Korea says it will be ready by mid-August to fire four missiles near the US territory of Guam, as a war of words with Washington intensifies.
State media said Hwasong-12 rockets would pass over Japan and land in the sea about 30km (17 miles) from Guam, if the plan was approved by Kim Jong-un.
Warnings of "fire and fury" from Donald Trump were denounced, and the US leader was described as "bereft of reason".
The US has warned the North its actions could mean the "end of its regime".
US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said Pyongyang would be "grossly overmatched" in any war against the US and its allies.
The North first announced on Wednesday that it was planning a missile strike against Guam, which is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people.
A later statement said the military would "finally complete the plan" by mid-August and report it to leader Kim Jong-un for his approval.
"The Hwasong-12 rockets to be launched by the KPA [Korean People's Army] will cross the sky above Shimane, Hiroshima and Koichi Prefectures of Japan,"state news agency KCNA said, quoting army chief General Kim Rak Gyom.
"They will fly 3,356.7km for 1,065 seconds and hit the waters 30-40km away from Guam."
It called President Trump's remarks on Tuesday that the North risked "fire and fury" as "a load of nonsense".
"Sound dialogue is not possible with such a guy bereft of reason and only absolute force can work on him," it added.
Amid escalating rhetoric, Mattis issued a strongly worded statement on Wednesday, called on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme.
"The DPRK [Democratic People's Republic of Korea] must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons," he said.
"While our state department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth."
Trump boasted about America's atomic arsenal earlier on Wednesday.
Tweeting from New Jersey where he is on holiday, the president said the US nuclear stockpile was "more powerful than ever before".
Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has sought to reassure Americans that North Korea does not pose an imminent threat.
Speaking in Guam, he said he was hopeful a global "pressure campaign" involving Russia and China could lead to new dialogue with Pyongyang "about a different future".
Tillerson said the situation had not dramatically changed over the past few days, and that Americans "should sleep well at night".
China has urged calm, describing the situation as "complex and sensitive".
Despite rounds of UN sanctions, Pyongyang carried out two nuclear tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July.
On Tuesday, a media report in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.
However, most analysts doubt the country would launch a suicidal pre-emptive attack on the US.
North Korea remains technically in a state of war with the US and South Korea after the 1950-53 conflict on the peninsula ended in a truce.
The tiny but important island of Guam
The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii.
It is a "non-incorporated" US territory, with a population of about 163,000.
That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections.
US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more.
It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like theSouth China Sea,the Koreasand theTaiwan Straits.

The government was also deciding to even postpone the agreement being inked for 48 hours had the debate on the previous day come up with constructive proposals, Premier Wickremesinghe said. But those of the opposition who did not need to have a debate on the matter, disrupted the debate. The government also had decided to hold a Cabinet meeting the same night to make amendments to the agreement if there were such constructive suggestions. But it did not materialize.
The Premier made these observations yesterday, in response to a question raised by JVP Parliamentarian Nalinda Jayathissa during the round of questions to be raised from the Prime Minister.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said the agreement inked between the Sri Lankan Government and China Merchant Holdings to develop the Hambantota Port includes a clause that enabled further amendments to the same. The Premier added that although there was such a clause, it is needed to determine the amendments that are needed to be adopted.
The Premier further said CPC Trade Unions did not raise any issue on the agreement, but only wanted to handle oil bunkering. But the Ports Authority did not agree to it. He added that although the CPC trade unions needed it, the CPC had not made such a request.
"The operating loss from the Hambantota Port, to this date is Rs 9,814 million, while the overall revenue had been Rs. 7,119 million. The overall loss to this date, has been Rs 51,530 million. The total amount paid as debts to date is Rs 40,813 million. We could not leave this burden to the future generation. It would be possible to provide much needed employment opportunities for the younger generation," the Premier added. However, Trade Unions of the Colombo Port had requested the government not to use the revenue generated from the Colombo Port for the maintenance of the Hambantota Port.
Code of Conduct for MPs to be taken up in Parliament soon: Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, observed that the Bill on the Code of Conduct for Parliamentarians to maintain the dignity and decorum of Parliament, would be taken up for debate very soon in Parliament.
The Speaker made this observation when presenting the final draft of the code of conduct for MPs.
He added that it had been prepared with opinions and suggestions from local and foreign experts.
The Speaker also sought the cooperation of all MPs to ensure the implementation of the Code of Conduct for Parliamentarians to maintain the dignity and decorum of Parliament.
The code had been formulated with the intention of ensuring the protection of dignity and decorum of the House and to rebuild public trust on MPs who would be required to maintain the highest standards of conduct," the Speaker said. "The draft is now ready for the passing of it in Parliament on a future date. This presentation of the draft could be considered a historic moment. He also said that a draft of the code had been given to each MP and later their suggestions to improve and amend some sections of the code took place and the final draft has been prepared by Legal Draftsmen.
All imported rice stocks poison free: Govt.
The Government yesterday, assured that all rice stocks brought into the country in the wake of the drought, are free of harmful chemicals and thoroughly checked before being released to the market.
Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harison made this assurance when queried by MP Dullas Allahapperuma in Parliament.
The minister said the prolonged dry spell had led to the loss of approximately 50 percent of the paddy harvest and the Government had decided to import rice to avoid any shortage of staple food. All the imported rice stocks are regularly being checked by the Health Ministry and Food Commissioners Department.
"We guarantee that all the imported rice stocks are poison-free, he noted.
Govt. will accommodate Opp. MPs proposals to new Inland Revenue Bill: Malik
The Government would accommodate the proposals of Opposition MPs to the new Inland Revenue Bill at its Committee Stage debate in Parliament, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said.
The minister made this observation in Parliament yesterday, when JO MP Bandula Gunawardena proposed the Government not to remove tax exemptions and concessions provided to the gem industry. The gem industry enjoys considerable tax relief. However, the new Inland Revenue Bill has removed all these tax concessions and exemptions facilitated to the Gem Industry. This is detrimental to the gem business, he said.
Minister Samarawickrama said necessary amendments could be presented to the Bill during the Committee Stage debate once taken up in Parliament. The minister said the Government is in the process of finalizing Amendments to the Bill. The Amendments are being discussed with the Finance Minister, he added.
MP Gunawardena requested the minister to give them a copy of the Amendments the Government intends to bring into the Bill at the Committee Stage.
The Supreme Court determined that several Clauses in the Inland Revenue Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution. The Government said it would duly amend the problematic clauses as per the determination of the Supreme Court.
The Government presented the Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament for first reading on July 5. The Bill is to provide for the imposition of Income Tax for any year of assessment commencing on or after April 1, 2017.
The Bill, among other things, introduces a new income tax structure and is aimed at closing existing loopholes in revenue collection.
Maha Illuppallama Seed Farm not for sale: Duminda
Agricultural Minister Duminda Dissanayake yesterday in Parliament, denied claims that the Government was planning to hand over the Maha Illuppallama seed farm to a foreign company.
The Minister was responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake as to whether the Government intends to lease out 300 acres of the Maha Illuppallama seed farm to a Bangladesh private company named Lal Teer for a period of 50 years.
However, the Minister said a draft agreement has been prepared to obtain foreign technology to produce hybrid vegetable seeds within the country. Each year we spend Rs 1.4 billion to import hybrid vegetable seeds to the country. Our attempt is to save this money in the country and help our Agriculture Department to produce hybrid vegetable seeds with the support of our farming community. Seed paddy production has not been allowed under this agreement, the minister explained, while also tabling a copy of the draft agreement.
MP Dissanayake, raising a question under Standing Order 23 (2) in Parliament on a previous day, alleged that the local seed production could collapse if the deal is inked.
This deal not only vests the right of local seed production to a foreign company, but also grants it the authority to import seeds and obtain patents for local seeds. This may pave way for bio-piracy. The Government has not discussed this move with any stakeholder, the MP charged.
Withdrawal of five NFF MPs:No impact on legality, CA proceedings: Speaker
The withdrawal of five National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarians led by MP Wimal Weerawansa has zero impact on the legality and proceedings of the Constitutional Assembly (CA), Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced in Parliament yesterday.
MP Weerawansa asked the Speakers position over the letter submitted to the latter late last month informing the withdrawal of NFF from the Assembly. In our letter, we stated that the CA would no longer be valid with our withdrawal, because the resolution adopted in Parliament states that the CA consists of all 225 members. We would like to hear the Speakers opinion on this matter, Weerawansa said. The Speaker observed the NFF pulling out of CA has not given rise to any problem. I obtained legal advice before coming in to this conclusion, he added.
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella observed that all 225 MPs need not necessarily take part in CA sittings.
If there is quorum, the CA can go ahead with its work, Kiriella said.
The CA was formed following a resolution passed unanimously in Parliament in March last year to formulate a new Constitution. It has so far conducted four sittings.

Ravi Resigns: Says he sacrificed position to set an example and for democracy and good governance

Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake this afternoon publicly resigned from the Cabinet saying he was sacrificing his position to set an example and fordemocracy and good governance.
Raising the point that he had been advised by his lawyers that there was no reason for him to resign, he said he chose to make the decision in keeping with his moral conscience and on behalf of the party and the government.
The former Minister said that he was proud to sacrifice his position for good governance and that he would with equal pride take his place among the backbenchers in Parliament, knowing that he had sacrificed his position for the greater good.
Extolling the virtues of the Yahapalanaya government, the former Minister noted that never before had a sitting Minister been hauled before a commission to testify on his actions  This is a mark of the good governance government, the former Minister said.
He continued to defend his position regarding the allegations brought against him in Treasury bond issue and furnished the Parliament with details of a Seylan Bank loan he had taken in order to buy the Monarch apartment at the centre of the controversy.
The former Minister also pointed out that he had only obtained lease and subsequent purchase of the Monarch apartment as a result of his daughters friendship with Annika Wijesuriya and that there had been no ulterior motive to the transaction. 
Defending further his position, the former Minister said that his reputation was unblemished and that many of the 33 Joint Opposition (JO) members that had brought a no-confidence motion against him were aware of his character.
In conclusion the former Minister thanked his wife and daughter for standing by him through this trying time, even while facing numerous allegations of besmirched character, despite having done no wrong.

Ravi under a cloud
The conduct of former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake who is now Foreign Minister is looming as the greatest crisis faced by the National Unity government following revelations made at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Bond sale.
Giving evidence before the Commission two weeks ago, Anika Wijesuriya, daughter of businessman Nahil Wijesuriya was to reveal that an apartment owned by her was rented by the Karunanayake family for whom the rent was paid by Arjun Aloysius.
Familys transactions
Aloysius is the son-in-law of Arjuna Mahendran, the former Governor of the Central Bank under whose tenure the controversial sale of Central Bank bonds occurred. Aloysius is also a Director of Perpetual Treasuries Limited, the company at the centre of the controversial sale.
Following the explosive testimony from Wijesuriya, the Commission of Inquiry summoned Foreign Minister Karunanayake to give evidence. The Minister took his time to appear before the Commission. When he eventually did, last Wednesday, he was grilled for over five hours.
Minister Karunanayakes stance at the Commission centred on one theme. That was to say that he was unaware of the transactions entered into by his wife and family. Had he been aware of Aloysiuss involvement in renting the property he lived in, he wouldnt have allowed it, Karunanayake said. The Ministers position has been greeted with widespread scepticism, both publicly and in private. Social media has been awash with posts lampooning Karunanayake for his I didnt know stance, claiming that he was unaware of his wifes transactions running into more than ten million rupees.
Since then, there has been a great deal of political activity surrounding the issue. The Joint Opposition (JO) has taken the lead in submitting a motion of no confidence against Minister Karunanayake. The signatories to the motion are from the JO. The motion has been submitted to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
On Tuesday, Speaker Jayasuriya noted that objections have been raised against the motion on the grounds that the matter under discussion is an ongoing probe before a Commission of Inquiry and hence sub judice. Speaker Jayasuriya has said he will make a ruling on the matter today (Thursday).
In the meantime, calls have been growing for Minister Karunanayakes resignation. These calls have come not only from the JO and other parties in the opposition but also from within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and even sections of the United National Party (UNP) itself.
Karunanayakes resignation
Opposition stalwarts such as Dinesh Gunawardena, Bandula Gunawardena, Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and G L Peiris have been vocal in calling for Minister Karunanayakes resignation. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) has also called for the Minister to step down.
There had been some speculation that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had refrained from signing the motion of no-confidence against Karunanayake. However, Rajapaksa publicly declared that he had no qualms about voting against the Minister when it is put to a vote in Parliament.
I would cast my vote gladly not only against Ravi Karunanayake but also against the present Government. This is the first time Im going to vote in Parliament after this Government was elected to office, Rajapaksa stated at a public meeting, quashing speculation that he was evading the issue.
The SLFP Ministers have taken the lead from within the government in calling for Karunanayake to step down. Minister S B Dissanayake called on the President and the Prime Minister to take a decision as he feared the issue would damage the dignity of the government and even lead to public unrest.
Minister Susil Premajayantha was to note that the peoples confidence in the Foreign Minister had been shattered due to the alleged controversial transaction that had occurred when he was the Minister of Finance. It would affect his duties in international matters as well, Premajayantha observed.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera who had been lampooned for mispronouncing the Royal College motto Disce aut Discede used the same phrase - pronounced correctly - to suggest that Karunanayake, an old Royalist, should resign. In the language of Royalists, he should learn or depart, Jayasekera said.
Minister Mahinda Amaraweera was to suggest that a motion of no confidence against Karunanayake will not be required. Amaraweera said he did not believe that anybody would have to bring in a no-confidence motion. What has to be done would be done before that, Minister Amaraweera said.
Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena was more direct in his observations. President Maithripala Sirisena may remove Minister Karunanayake if he does not resign over revelations uncovered by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Bond scam, Abeywardena was to declare.
The Minister went so far as to say that President Sirisena is likely to take a decision on Karunanayake within the next two weeks. If found innocent, Karunanayake can always come back, Abeywardena suggested and cited the resignation of E L Senanayake from J R Jayewardenes Cabinet in the 1980s.
It is understood that the UNP ministers are dismayed with the current circumstances they find themselves in. They fear that with Local Government and Provincial Council elections due soon, the ongoing developments could cause irreparable damage to the partys prospects at the polls.
Minister Daya Gamage said he personally believed it was appropriate for Minister Karunanayake to quit his portfolio until his innocence was proved in the allegations against him. Such a decision on the part of the Minister will be good for the party, Gamage, the National Organiser of the UNP, said.
Minister Sajith Premadasa was not quite as forthcoming but has declared that he would resign from the Cabinet if he is asked to vote for corrupt people. At the height of the UNPs leadership crisis in December 2011, Premadasa contested Karunanayake for the Deputy Leaders post and won.
Initially, media reports suggested that President Maithripala Sirisena had met Karunanayake at a ceremony to mark Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes 40 years as a parliamentarian and suggested that he should resign. Karunanayake was to vehemently deny these reports.
It was however reported that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe did meet with Karunanayake. The sentiments of a group of UNP parliamentarians, who believe that Karunanayake should resign to limit the political damage that the Bond issue is causing the party, would have been conveyed to him.
UNP stalwarts
Many ministers in the government feel Karunanayakes position in the government is untenable- at least until the Commission of Inquiry concludes and releases its findings. They cite the resignation of Tilak Marapone after he made a speech in Parliament defending a client of his in the House.
The UNP, in particular, has reason to be concerned. By not acting forthwith and stalling on the issue of Karunanayakes resignation and, it is creating an impression that it is attempting to protect him, party stalwarts have noted. This is allowing the SLFP to take the moral high ground, they argue.
While the JO is happy to revel in Minister Karunanayakes misery, it is indeed the SLFP faction of the government which stands to gain from the current situation, UNP ministers say. If the President was to sack Karunanayake instead of the minister resigning, it would jeopardise the UNP further, they say.
As such, UNP stalwarts would prefer to see Karunanayake resign, rather than dragging the UNP down with him. Thus far the beleaguered Foreign Minister has protested and remained defiant, arguing that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence until he is found guilty by a process of law.
The coming days would undoubtedly see more developments on this issue and the first step in that process is the motion of no-confidence in Parliament against Minister Karunanayake.
The government hopes it can avoid that because if it is put to the vote, even some UNPers may vote for it.
That can be prevented only if Ravi Karunanayake hands over his resignation. At the time of writing, that has not happened. Nevertheless, what is certain is that the outcome of this saga will have a bearing on the prospects of both the UNP and, by extension, the SLFP, at the forthcoming elections.

Ravi's issue figures in cabinet
President stresses the need to be united:
Harin says AGs Dept should be empowered to probe previous Govt. :
Extensive discussions took place at the Cabinet meeting, last morning, on the controversy surrounding Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
Minister Rajitha Senarathne, commenting on the matter, had said the Presidential Commission was appointed to look into the Bond issue and that the apartment issue was totally irrelevant to it. However, Cabinet Ministers had reportedly voiced their objection to it.
Senarathne had also blamed a ministerial colleague regarding the appointment of a spouse of one of the officers of the Attorney General to an authority falling under her purview. The Minister had defended her stance stating that the spouse was well qualified to be in her position and as such no insinuations should be drawn.
President Maithripala Sirisena who was chairing the meeting had then shifted his focus to Minister Harin Fernando who had earlier commented on the Bond Commission, saying that the mechanism of the Presidential Commission had finally been able to address issues of corruption and find evidence relating to it. Fernando had also said that the UNPers feel unfairly targeted.
The President had asked Fernando regarding the comments made, to which Fernando had reportedly responded saying that the Attorney Generals department should be strengthened to continue to handle cases of corruption including those of the previous regime.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had reportedly responded in what was described as a long harangue.
Both Fernando and Kabir Hashim had said that many members and supporters of the United National Party also feel that they have been unfairly targeted whilst members of the previous regime alleged of corruption have not been held responsible.
President Sirisena had then intervened and informed the Ministers that the Bond Commission was formulated in consultation with the Prime Minister and that the recent issue should not drive a wedge between the government.
He had insisted that the government should work united and ensure smooth functioning of government.
Meanwhile, it was also reported that whilst the President was chairing the meeting, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had left the meeting 90 minitues before it ended.
Speculation was rife that he had left the meeting to meet Minister Ravi Karunanayake who may have entered the premises of the Presidential Secretariat, where the Cabinet meeting was held.

Rogue elephant tramples 15 to death in India
INDIA: An elephant that has killed 15 people in eastern India over a months-long rampage could be shot within days if it is not brought under control, an official said Wednesday.
Wildlife rangers and hunters assembled in Jharkhand after another victim was trampled to death Tuesday evening, the states chief forest and wildlife conservator L.R. Singh told AFP.
The rogue elephant crushed four victims in Bihar state in March before crossing into neighbouring Jharkhand and killing 11 more.
Villagers are living in fear, especially the Paharia tribe that lives on the upper hillier regions where the elephant roams. Something must be done, Singh said, referring to one of the poorest indigenous tribal communities in eastern India.
We have a team of experts and hunters here with us. We are brainstorming a solution... one of them is to shoot the animal. But thats the last resort and we will take a call in a day or two.
The marauding elephant likely wandered from its herd and became lost, straying into villages where the killings took place.
Elephants kill roughly 60 people every year in forested Jharkhand, Singh said, just a fraction of the estimated 1,100 who died nationwide from elephant or tiger attacks in the three years to May.
The environment ministry estimates a person dies every day in India in clashes with these endangered, jungle-dwelling animals -- the vast majority crushed by elephants.
Violent encounters between elephants and humans were an increasing trend, said Singh, as vast swathes of forest are cleared for human settlements or industry. - AFP

The theme of International Youth Day 2017 is Youth Building Peace. There is growing recognition that as agents of change, young people are critical actors in conflict prevention and sustaining peace. So the day this year is dedicated to celebrating young peoples contributions to conflict prevention and transformation as well as inclusion, social justice and sustainable reconciliation.
The current generation of youth is the largest in history and young people often comprise the majority in countries marked by armed conflict or unrest. As such, considering the needs and aspirations of youth in matters of peace and security is a demographic imperative. Another Security Council Resolution, recognizes that the scale and challenges of sustaining peace requires partnerships between stakeholders, including youth organisations. It also reaffirms the important role youth can play in deterring and resolving conflicts, and are key constituents in ensuring the success of both peacekeeping and peace building efforts.
Why is everyone expected to care about this day for young people One reason is because there are more youth on the planet than ever before. The UN Population Fund estimates that people inhabiting this earth between the ages of 10 and 24 number 1.8 billion. Now considering your sheer numbers if each of you does something to help your community, just imagine the difference you can make in the world.
Enjoying life
It is true that youth unemployment has already been hitting record highs with predictions that the problem will be getting worse. That is why the world is being exhorted to create opportunities for young people to build intellect, skills and confidence. And involving them in debates about local and global issues is more important than ever. That is another reason why the day is reserved for the whole world to be reminded to recognise how brilliant and important young people such as you are to the world.
IYD focuses on the rights of these young people to have full access to education, adequate healthcare, employment opportunities, financial services and full participation in public life. In a climate of economic uncertainty, it is all the more important for countries to invest in opportunities for their youth to learn, earn and grow so that the common future lies in good hands.
It is just one of the many extensive efforts of the UN to help member states reach out to their youth. Along with ensuring their rights, an equally important goal of IYD is to shape the youth not just as a passive beneficiary of development efforts, but as a force for positive social change. They are a source of innovation, creativity, energy and foresight, and all states must use all means possible to foster and harness the power of the youth. These are the ideals of International Youth Day.
No one in his right mind would deny the young their licence to enjoy life to its fullest. After all, it is said that joy is the Fountain of Eternal Youth. We would have a very jaded younger generation if it has lost its nerve and swerve. Surely we have all been there and have savoured the delights of youthful bliss and elation with an aching nostalgia.
Time was not long ago when adolescence was compounded by excitement and high-spirited capers, all indulged in with a kind of energetic innocence. But for many baby boomers those were spacious times that held a great many values which have eroded with the passage of time. It is also true that in todays world, youth are likely to encounter more ethical and moral temptations, greater spiritual battles, and more emotional and relational struggles than any other generation in history.
Powerful agents
You young people are not only our future, you are our present. Our planet has never been so young, with 1.8 billion young women and men. They are the most connected, the most outspoken and the most open-minded generation the world has ever seen.
You are powerful agents of positive change, essential to taking forward the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is not enough to hope for a better tomorrow you must act now. Change is underway, and millions of citizens are already transforming the way we produce, consume, behave and communicate.
There are countless initiatives like this, all giving shape to a new humanism, to new forms of solidarity and citizenship to combat poverty, marginalization and despair.
Well qualified
Everyone appears to be focusing on building on the assets we hold within our own small universe. These include property, machinery, markets and raw materials among other resources, which are all acquirable through artificial sources. Everyone is quick to concentrate on this capital. But if we aim to accomplish any real progress it is imperative that we focus our attention on our youthful human capital, which is the most vital component for the success of any nation.
In Sri Lanka for instance we are in desperate need of an abundance of a well qualified intellectual nucleus to make the country a leading destination for multinationals to outsource their professional services in the fields of accountancy, information technology, medicine, law and banking. This refers to the potential executive and managerial high-end of the intellectual stratum. But identical priority should be extended to the other level of the dwindling services and labour market which is equally significant if the country is to achieve rapid economic growth in the years to come.
There are also young people whose chances of participating in the human capital formation have been lost due to lack of opportunities to further their educational and vocational skills because of the woeful system of our education. All this meant that a major slice of potential contributors to human capital has gradually diminished.
Optimism and confidence do not mean we minimise the challenges ahead. Most young people live today in least developed countries, and shoulder the heaviest burden of conflicts and poverty. There can be no sustainable development if they remain on the side-lines.

SL records 54.7% labour force participation rate in Q1
The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) Sri Lanka has released the results of the Sri Lanka labour force survey for the first quarter of 2017 (January, February, March).
Labour Force Survey (LFS) is designed to measure the levels and trends of employment, unemployment and labour force in Sri Lanka. This survey has been conducted quarterly, since the first quarter of 1990. LFS 2017 is the 37th survey of the survey series. The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has released labour force statistics for the first quarter of 2017, based on a sample of 6,430 housing units covering the whole country.
The working-age of a person in Sri Lanka is defined as the age 15 years and above. The estimated working-age household population for the 1st quarter of 2017 is about 15.7 million. This shows an increase of 0.3 million compared to the 1st quarter of 2016. This may be due to the increase in net migration and internal movements.
The total working age population who are employed or unemployed during the reference week is identified as the economically active population or the labour force of the country. The estimated economically active population is about 8.6 million in the 1stquarter of 2017, of which 62.7% are males and 37.3% are females.
Labour force population expressed as a percentage of the working-age population (age 15 years and above) is the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR). The survey results reveal that the overall LFPR for the first quarter of 2017 is 54.7% and this is recorded as 75.1% and 37.6% for males and females respectively.
Persons, who worked at least one hour during the reference period, as paid employees, employers, own account workers or contributing family workers are said to be employed. The estimated employed population for the1st quarter of 2017 is about 8.2 million, of which, about 45%are engaged in the Services sector, 28% in the Industry sector and 27%are in the Agriculture sector. The highest employment share is reported for the Service sector and the same pattern can be seen for both males and females. In this quarter, the lowest employment share is reported for the Agriculture sector. The survey also reveals that 68.1% of the employed population work more than 40 hours per week.
During the reference period of the survey, persons who did not work and looking for work and taken actions to find a job in the prior 4 weeks of the survey, also ready to accept a job given a work opportunity within next two weeks are said to be unemployed. The proportion of unemployed population to the total labour force is defined as the unemployment rate.
The estimated unemployment rate for the first quarter of 2017 is 4.1%. DCS stated that a bulletin prepared with the information of the labour force estimates for the 1st quarter of 2017 has been published in the DCS website : www.statististics.gov.lk.

SLUGNA requests withdrawal of Home Ministry circular
The Sri Lanka United Grama Niladhari Association (SLUGNA) have requested the Home Affairs Ministry to withdraw the circular which assigned most of the tasks performed by Grama Niladhari officials to development officers attached to the Home Affairs Ministry with immediate effect.
Addressing a media briefing held in yesterday, SLUGNA President W.M.P.B.Wanninayake said around 14,022 development officers attached to the Home Affairs Ministry have been assigned to the Grama Niladhari divisions while around 2,798 officers were assigned to the Divisional Secretariats.
While the Home affairs Ministry has published a list of duties and responsibilities for the development officers, all previously handled by Grama Niladhari officers. We will rise up against the attempts to handover our duties and responsibilities to the development officers, he said.
We are also opposing the move to implement this circular further assigning out duties and responsibilities to the development officers. He said that development officers too are not satisfied with this decision. The Minister has already called for proposals from both parties and we expect the problem will be solved shortly, he said.
Otherwise, We have to find a way of taking trade union action if there is no solution, he added. He said a Grama Niladharis job is not an easy task. We have to work closely with the people every time to provide them a quality administrative service. But, our service is not confined to administrative affairs alone and we have to seek solutions to the personal problems of villages sometimes, he said.
The Grama Niladhari officer is a public official whose working time is not limited to an eight hour working day. Therefore,a salary should be amended considering the working time and the service we rendered. There is also a need a new service constitution to streamline the recruitments and solving several other anomalies and hardships affected to the service, he added.

Treasury Bond issue: Commission seeks information of W. M. Mendis and Company
Perpetual Capital Holdings CEO Arjun Aloysius was requested to provide information including audited accounts, bank statements and other relevant documentation from 2013 to 2017, of the W. M. Mendis and Company to the Treasury Bond Commission, it was revealed yesterday.
The letter seeking the aforesaid information had been sent on August 8,2017.
The legal representative of Arjun Aloysius, Presidents Counsel Anuja Premaratne yesterday sought a time extension to submit the necessary documentation. We received this letter yesterday. It requests to provide the information on or before August 10, which would be tomorrow. It is not possible for us comply with the letter due to several difficulties.
Premaratne PC pointed out that W. M. Mendis and Company is a separate legal entity from the Perpetual Capital Holdings. Subjected to the companys objection, we will try to provide the necessary information by August 16,2017, he said.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake informed the PCoI that they have not yet received details on Free Lanka Group, while pointing out the importance of getting the web of companies owned by Arjun Aloysius and Geoffrey Aloysius out in the open.
A reference was made to a letter dated July 27,2017 sent by the Treasury Bond Commission to the Perpetual Capital Holdings requesting information on its transactions from January 2015.
Chairman Justice K.T. Chitrasiri observed that Free Lanka Group has not sent a legal representative to the PCoI.
Counsel for PTL Nihal Fernando said the matter does not fall under his purview. Lawyer representing Perpetual Capital Holdings informed the PCoI that Free Lanka Group is a separate company which should disclose its details on its own.
Commissions Chairman K.T. Chitrasiri said the PCoI will issue a summon to Free Lanka Group in necessity arise.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P.S. Jayawardena yesterday questioned Perpetual Treasuries Limited CEO Kasun Palisena on PTLs frequent trading partners.
Palisena was questioned by Justice Jayawardena while he was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating and inquiring into the Treasury bond issue, for the second consecutive day. Evidence was led by PTL lawyer Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando.
Justice Jayawardena observed that some traders have shown interest in doing deals with PTL. He also noted that there was number of internal trading going on between Perpetual Asset Management, Perpetual Capital Holdings, Walt and Rows and PTL.
Justice Jayawardena requested Palisena to list out other traders who frequently trade with his company.
Palisena told WealthTrust securities, First Capital Holdings, Natwealth Group, Capital Alliance, Bank of Ceylon and Acuity Group are PTLs frequent trading partners.
Justice Jayawardena asked Palisena There were only few deals with Employees Provident Fund by PTL from 28 March 2014 up until February 27,2015, Palisena replied, Most probably yes. The EPF was not a frequent trading partner of our company.
Palisena told the Commission that due to allegations all over the media of a possible Treasury bond scam where PTL was involved, it lost some traders such as the Bank of Ceylon.
Almost all the other traders want to carry out business with us. Some are even coming after us! PTL CEO Palisena said.
Who are these dealers coming after you Fernando PC asked. However, Fernando PC did not receive a reply from Palisena. Then Fernando PC went on to say maybe I should receive instructions on the topic.

TURNING back from devolution
An Open Letter to Prof G L Peiris:
Prof G L Peiris
Leader, SLPP.
Dear Professor Peiris,
I thought I must write to you despite your obviously busy schedule, both because you at least nominally lead one aspect of the Rajapaksa comeback project under the banner of the nascent SLPP and also because you are, unarguably, as a former foreign minister, a key advisor to defeated President Rajapaksa on matters relating to post war, national reconciliation. I must at the outset explain why I stated that you lead one aspect of the Rajapaksa comeback project because it is never clear to any observer or the public, which brother number two (pardon the pun) Basil or Gotabhaya proposes to replace Mahinda as the heir to the attempted Rajapaksa dynasty. Would a toss of a coin determine, which Rajapaksa becomes the next presidential Rajapaksa candidate But of course, your bets are on Basil, however, I think Gotabhaya is streets ahead in the inter-Rajapaksa primaries to be the next Rajapaksa candidate in 2020. Of course, Mahinda believes that this government will fall long before that, then again, his political judgement has been quite suspect of late, after all, he thought he would win in 2015 and lost not once but twice.
Sinhala Eelam and the Sinhala National Alliance (SNA)
I believe it was a friend and mutual colleague from the days of the Kumaratunga presidency, which we both served at one point, who coined the phrase, Sinhala Eelam to denote the Sinhala equivalent of the narrow ethnic based, exclusionary political vision and extremely violent political program, which Prabhakaran and the LTTE promoted and fought for. The LTTE had a vision, that the North and East of Sri Lanka was mono ethnically Tamil, that there was no space or need to accommodation any others as equal partners and that a strong leader, tolerating no dissent was necessary to protect the Tamils from the Sinhala people and one presumes the Muslim people.
It is very worrying that the political rhetoric and discourse emanating from the Rajapaksa comeback project and its political vehicles of the JO and the SLPP, make worryingly Prabhakaran like arguments except for this time in relation to the Sinhala people. Again, a distinct territory (the whole of Sri Lanka) is the sole preserve of a single ethnoreligious group, the Sinhala people need a strong leader to protect them from enemies within and without, which again also includes the poor long-suffering Muslims who got hit from both the Tamil Eelamists and now from the Sinhala Eelamists. We have heard this rhetoric before and it was not pretty and it was also resoundingly defeated at the elections of 2015. Perhaps a rethink might be in order.
I have also observed that despite the acrimony and vitriol directed at the governing national alliance and specifically the United National Party (of which you were a front bencher in a previous avatar), the real bogey which the Rajapaksa comeback project seems to target is the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) led by the veteran Rajavarothian Sambanthan, who you should recognize for having rather adroitly captured the leadership of the Tamil polity, post the war and considerably moderated the TNA. Now the TNA representing a minority community and steadfastly limiting its political activities and appeal to the North and East is logical given its own Tamil constituencys demographics in the Northern and Eastern provinces. On the other hand, a responsible national opposition to be a genuine alternative government needs to represent or broaden its appeal to the entire country and it is a feature of the Rajapaksa support base, that it is limited to the Sinhala people, that also predominantly of the majority religion and mostly in the Southern part of the country or outside the North and East. Regrettably, for Sri Lanka, the Rajapaksa come back project should be more aptly titled the Sinhala National Alliance (SNA) and is limited to the areas outside the Northern, Eastern and Central Provinces.
Reconciliation
Dear Professor Peiris, you have impeccable credentials or at least experience in national reconciliation, having first advocated President Kumaratungas devolution package from 1994-1999, then catapulting to the front bench of the subsequent UNP Government under Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe from 2001-2004 as well as that Governments chief peace negotiator with the LTTE and of course since 2005, been a loyalist of the Rajapaksa clan. So, you have the unique distinction of having worked with three of the main political protagonists at the apex of Sri Lankas political establishment, namely CBK, Ranil and Mahinda.
If you had read the roll of the electoral dice correctly in 2015, you may even now have been advising President Sirisena, then your political journey would have been truly unique.
However, despite this extensive experience in reconciliation and peace processes it is quite concerning and somewhat disappointing to witness what can only be termed fear mongering and narrow exclusionary politics in terms of the recent responses to first the OMP and more recently to the enabling domestic legislation for the international convention against enforced disappearances. You should no doubt recognize that defeated President Rajapaksa committed Sri Lanka to accountability in the joint communiqu with the then UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon in 2009 and significantly failed to create the basis for non-reoccurrence and a durable peace.
It would be extremely desirable if in the national, as opposed to a partisan interest, if defeated President Rajapaksa supported his successor in office, in the arduous but necessary task of national reconciliation.
Yours sincerely
Harim Peiris

University for Policing and Criminal Justice to be established: PM
Setting out the governments plans dedicated to ensuring capacity building of the Police force, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday announced that a University for Policing and Criminal Justice will be established in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister made the announcement while attending the inauguration ceremony of the Senior Officers Inter Regional Conference on Countering Terrorism and Transnational Crime organised by the INTERPOL along with the Sri Lanka Police at the BMICH yesterday.
Once established, the University will be only the fourth university in the world dedicated to Police and Criminal Justice studies. Currently, only India and South Korea have universities providing studies in Policing the Prime Minister Pointed out.
According to Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, while Military education and training in the country has developed rapidly the Police in the last two decades have fallen behind.
Therefore,the university will be the apex body dedicated to the studies on Policing in Sri Lanka, the Prime Minister said adding that the government expects to expand its functions to provide education to qualified individuals across the region. It can be a University for the region, he said.
According to the Prime Minister, the university can be Sri Lankas contribution to the region for combatting terrorism and transnational crime which are becoming more of a Police function today by developing the capacity building of the regions Police forces. The university will also be open for other members of law enforcement such as the customs along with individuals working in the fields of law and criminal justice.
The Premier also said that reforms to laws relating to the Police are now being looked at by the Minister of Law and Order. Sri Lanka Police continues work under the Police ordinance which was ratified 151 years ago, and some provisions are outdated while the rank structure today is not reflected in the Police ordinance, thats how outdated we are, the Prime Minister said. Therefore, while the government is looking towards reforming the Police Ordinance, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also claimed that with the 13th Amendment devolving powers to the Police the authorities are now looking how to reorganise the Police to function along with it.
While speaking about the many challenges faced by the Police force in the modern era due to technology and increased connectivity the Prime Minister also requested the INTERPOL to conduct an audit into the corporation among the Police forces of the region.
We must ensure that the conferences and workshops are increasing the sharing of information and corporations among the Police forces of the region, he said adding that therefore an audit is needed. The inauguration ceremony of the Senior Officers Inter Regional Conference on Countering Terrorism and Transnational Crime organised by the INTERPOL along with the Sri Lanka Police and funded by the Canadian government was held under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
The event was also attended by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, INTERPOL officials, Diplomats, Government Officials, foreign delegates and Senior Police officers.The three-day conference attended by 45 senior police officers representing seven countries will conclude tomorrow.

Wijesiri to bring no-confidence motion against Faiszer Musthapha

UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri today told Parliament that he intends to hand over a no-confidence motion against Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
The MP, observing that Minister Musthapha was repetitively absent in the House to reply to the questions about Uva Provincial Council Chief Minister Chamara Dasanayake, alleged that Musthapha has failed in his duties as the subject Minister.
As an MP in the Yahapalana Government, I am ready to present a no-confidence motion against the Minister and I request the support of backbenchers to it. In this Yahapalana Government there is room for such actions against the ministers, he said.
The MP pointed out he filed complaint at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) as the charges made against the Chief Minister have been proven from the audit inquiries.
The Speaker, at many a times before, told the Minister in Parliament to pay attention to the allegations, but in vain. For some time now, the minister does not turn up in Parliament to answer to my questions, he said.
MP Wijesiri had been raising question after question in Parliament for the last two years on allegations against the Uva Chief Minister over financial misappropriations and irregularities.
Minister Mustapha had constantly maintained the position that he could not interfere into provincial issues coming under devolved subjects.
