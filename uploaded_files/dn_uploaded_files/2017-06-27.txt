Gudppl, Microsoft  BizSpark reinforced vision
Startups are established each year and are often paraded around with increasing fervour to describe scrappy young ventures, popular web-based apps and high-profile tech giants.
Gudppl (Good People) a social network based out of Sri Lanka, it is a dynamic mobile and web-based application which couples the skill-sets of volunteers with the interests of entities that need them.
Harinda Fonseka founder and Chief Executive Officer for Gudppl, said The idea that people can tailor their volunteering experience to their schedule, location, and areas of passion was unheard of until now. For organistions to use a single outlet through which to recruit volunteers to get involved in their work; non-existent.
The network wanted to allow local charities, religious institutions, and schools to consolidate their needs onto one platform so that prospective volunteers would know what is required of them and how and when to deliver It. Our primary goal at the time was to create a dynamic one-stop shop for people who wanted to do good on behalf of society, Harinda said. The network managed to develop a working prototype.
And while it seemed to work well for a while, it eventually brought a number of issues to the surface. With a lack of financial resources and time, we reached an insurmountable plateau. We participated in a startup programme and came across Microsofts BizSpark programmes, Harinda said.

Afraid of My Lunchbox..!
With the Prime minister of India, his cabinet, his party and his government turning a blind eye to the lynching and attacks on people eating beef, India must be creeping into the Guinness book, as the first country, maybe the only one where people are targeted, thrashed and tormented for their food habits!
The wife ran to my car as I started the engine this morning, You forgot your lunchbox! she cried.
No! I said in terror, I dont want it!
You dont want lunch today You know what the doctor said; skipping meals isnt going to help you get any healthier!
Yes, I said, looking fearfully at other flats in my building, where neighbours were peeping out at the commotion downstairs, But, Id prefer being alive than healthily dead!
You dont like my cooking she asked, arms akimbo, a sign of trouble. I love it! I said hastily, And I love it so much, I want to be around to eat another meal, and another and another!
The wife looked at me, as if I needed to visit a shrink, You know something, Im just going to leave the lunchbox on your car bonnet. Take it or leave it! Dont! I shouted, jumping out of the car, and running to her, Dont let our neighbours see that box!
Neighbours! she spat out and looked up to see a dozen of them staring down at her, What have neighbours got to do with your lunch!
They may be in touch with mobs! I whispered urgently, As soon as I leave, they will call some mob leader and get me lynched outside!
But why would you want to do this to my husband shouted the wife looking at all the neighbours, peeping from their windows.
Because, they think theres beef in the lunchbox!
Oh husband! laughed my wife, Its only chicken, I know you are not fond of beef! But they dont know! I said, looking fearfully up at the flats where I suspected men and women stood huddled, staring fixedly at my lunchbox, They dont know the difference between chicken or beef! The wife slowly looked at the now invisible neighbours, behind their window curtains, Maybe I need to give them cooking lessons! she suggested.
No! I shouted, Maybe you just need to take that lunchbox off my car, and back into the house.
Maybe I need to train you in karate or judo! she said, again standing with arms akimbo, looking at a fearful me, staring at my lunchbox. No, I said, Maybe we need to tell the Prime Minister to leave the nation alone, a country, once never afraid of their lunchboxes!
Wheres the Prime Minister asked the wife, looking like holy thunder. Having meetings across the globe with beef eating leaders, asking them to bring business to India! I said lamely.
I heard windows close, as I fearfully looked at my lunchbox on my bonnet filled with innocent chicken, but beef to all my neighbours..!

In 2004 we established a joint venture making AST a member of TUIs global destination management company network. We added value to this partnership in 2016 by jointly commissioning hotel RIU Sri Lanka in Ahungalla.

Appreciations
Vasantha Obeysekera: Dedicated cinephile
Vasantha Obeysekera, who blazed a trail in the cine-field and breathed new life into Sinhala cinema, left us on April 8, breathing his last.
These are days of extravagant claims on promoting ethnic reconciliation. It warms the heart to ruminate upon the close bond of friendship which held us together despite our irreconcilable differences. This narrative is essentially to recapture glimpses of some poignant moments in our personal relationship and is not a critique on Vasanthas film career.
Vasantha and I have been buddies for a period of five decades. We were together at Lake House. He was on the editorial staff of Sinhala/English dailies and I worked in the Editorial Administration Department.
I have had no particular penchant for cinema. For Vasantha, it was his passion. He had been a dedicated cinephile. As a fresher at his desk, no one paid any attention to his visual dreams. He could only share them with a pliant probationer like menarrating a script, describing the artistic and dramatic aspects and yearning for the fulfilment of that vision.
Over a period, we had covered a wide range of topics of theatrical and artistic interest. We discussed Satyajit Ray, who had left a cinematic heritage and Lester James Peiris, the doyen of Sinhala cinema. We talked about Pandit Ravi Shankar, the exponent of sithar. We had probed the politics and mass appeal of screen icons in India and Sri LankaMGR to Sunil Dutt to Gamini Fonseka
Who is the wit who said, a man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. It is true. Finally, opportunities nebulously opened up for Vasantha to break through the blocks and win his inner creative battles (per Steven Pressfield, in The War of Art)
In 1967, he found a slot on 'Sath Samudura' team to work with Film Director Prof. Siri Gurusinghe, as its co-Script Writer cum Assistant Director. After the 'Sath Samudura' stint, I saw Vasantha reading voraciously volumes of literatures on movie-making and techniques. In the meantime, in 1970, he directed 'Wes Gatho.' Through its debut, 'Wes Gatho' was well-received and reviewed by the press.
He got a break in 1971. With a view to honing his skills at a film institute in Paris, Vasantha left for France. I believe, he got a sponsorship through the courtesy of his brother Prof. Gananath Obeyesekere. We sat together and prepared his profile to be submitted in support of his application. Before leaving, to forestall potential tenant problems he wanted me to move into his house until his return, which I did. This was the tumultuous period of JVP insurrection (April-June) and, fortuitously, Vasantha was out of the country until late 1971.
After returning from France, he directed a couple of other films, 'Walmath Woowo,' 'Diyamanthi' and 'Palangatiyo.' 'Palangtiyo' was acclaimed by film critics and won plaudits. I kept abreast of Vasanthas progress from his own feedback to me and also went through press reviews. The portfolio of his productions, over a dozen or so, included many award-winning films.
After July, 1983, I lost count of his films and I had, perforce, fled the country. At the time I became acquainted with him (1965), Lake House was a hive of political activities. Dudley Senanayake, leading the 'Hath Haula' coalition, had just assumed office and the Federal Party (FP), led by S.J.V. Chelvanayagam, was a constituent of the government. SLFP-led campaign, alleging Dudleys secret pact with the FP and betrayal of the Sinhalese, had aroused passions.
Vasantha and I held sharply antagonistic views. I was a Federal Party activist and, in my perception, he was a Sinhala nationalist. He despised FP politics and Chelva was anathema to him. We had arguments over ethnic issues. Strangely, over the years, he had become mellowed and had drastically changed. He was close to President Chandrika Kumaratunga and had supported her peace initiatives. He condemned Sinhala chauvinism. If my recollection is correct, in pursuit of peace, he had joined other progressive artistes and academics and travelled to Vanni to meet with LTTE bigwigs. During my post-war visits to Vasantha, I have heard him castigating Mahindas triumphalism and tribalism.
At times of low spirits, Vasantha had brought me good tidings. I failed the B.A. (London) exam (External). After writing the exam again, in despair, I had given up on it and even forgotten about it. One evening, coming straight from Lake House, he excitedly rushed into my room and grabbed me in a bear hug, shouting congratulations! He handed me a printout from the teleprinter, which carried the pass list of successful B.A. candidates who sat the exam from Ceylon. My name was also there.
He was there again to share a buoyant moment with me; in October, 1976, when I took oaths as an Attorney-at-Law, my friends had a function at Wellawatte. My leader S.J.V. Chelva was there to bless me, together with several other MPs. There were Tamil, Sinhala and Muslim friends present. I was pleased to see Vasantha prominently seated among them with beaming smile.
I was forced to flee the country in the wake of the 1983 Black July anti-Tamil pogrom. Those were days of doom for the Tamils who were hunted down by the thousands, killed and maimed, their womenfolk violated, homes and businesses invaded, looted and set on fire by Sinhalese mobs, aided and abetted by men in uniform. It was a gloomy moment of grief to me. At that frantic moment, my friend Vasantha was the only person I could beseech to give me succour in Colombo and facilitate my flight out of the country.
A wee bit of digression and details may be warranted. The TULF political outfit, (of which the FP was a constituent) held its Annual Convention at Mannar on July 23 and 24 in1983. I was a TULF functionary and was away from Colombo for the Convention. Maybe, otherwise, I could not have been alive today to write this narrative. After concluding the first day sessions, TULF MPs (among them, only Sambanthan is alive today) and I were staying at Mannar Rest House. Close to midnight, we received calls from Jaffna informing about explosions and shootouts between the army and LTTE. Follow-up calls, in the early hours of the 24th told us that the army was running amok in Jaffna.
My abode in Colombo was a semi-detached house at 233/5 Cotta Road, Borella. Except for my next-door neighbours and a couple of others, who were Tamils or Muslims, residents in the neighbourhood were largely Sinhala families. My next-door neighbours had access to my residence telephone. I called them and found out that a Tamil bottle-dealer and some other residents close to our place had been killed. My neighbours were getting ready to move out to Kathiresan temple seeking safety. On their suggestion, I asked them to pick up a small bag from my cupboard, containing cash (Rs.2,000) and a passport, and to give it for safekeeping to Ajiths family (Not the real name). Ajiths were nice Sinhala neighbours in the second house, who were friendly with me and also had, now and then, supplied midday meals to me. When I tried to contact my next door neighbours again, nobody picked up my line and I guessed they were gone.
From Mannar, steering clear of army camps and checkpoints, I reached Jaffna. At this time some SLAF aircrafts were providing commercial flights from Jaffna to Colombo-Ratmalana and I took a flight to Colombo. I knocked at Vasanthas door at No.15 Lauries Road. I was in poor shape and he received me with a mirthless smile. Even as I explained my situation in few words, he shook his head in disgust. I am sorry, Nava, he said. I guessed that he felt awkward to see me in that condition.
Colombo was still in the grip of terror and tension. Vasantha thought it was not safe for me to visit my Cotta Road house to check on my stuff and, if possible, to retrieve them. Also, I had to collect my passport and cash from Ajiths, my neighbours. Vasantha took me by his moto guzzi to Borella Police Station, left me in the care of the OIC, and went alone to enquire about my stuff. He returned with a grim storythat the house was left wide open with doors and windows broken up and that no goods were there, except for piles of papers (from my clients files), partly burnt and scattered all over, rotting away in rain. Ajiths had returned only the passport. I didnt say anything. I did not have a pair of shoes. Neither did I have another set of pants to change into. I did not have enough funds either. Vasantha sheltered me for two days at his house. He escorted me everywhere to buy shoes, obtain Indian visa etc. Finally, he took me and dropped me off at Katunayake airport. His parting shot was pungent: "Nava, I love you. But I hate your politics. I want to see you alive. Get out and get lost anywhere. Dont ever come back to this wretched country."
I did, nevertheless, visit Sri Lanka for brief spells. In between, I have had the miserable life of a vagrant in different countries before Icould find a habitat in Canada.
I remained constantly in touch with Vasantha from abroad. During my several visits to Sri Lanka during the war, when I could not visit Jaffna to see my family and friends, I had stayed with him and gone out with him for meals.
Incidentally, I remember, in November, 2005, few days before the Presidential Election, Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Nimalka Fernando had joined Vasantha and me for a meal at a restaurant in Colombo. Vasudeva was rooting for Mahinda at that time.
He assured us that Mahinda was not a racist, but a human rights activist who had gone with him to Geneva to plead the case of the JVP victims. The revolutionary old guard had since become a protg of Mahinda.
During my last visit to Sri Lanka in late 2015, I went looking for Vasantha at his Lauries Road residence. I was told that he had gone to stay with his daughter.
His daughter knows me. When I called her, she told me, Uncle, he will be happy to see you; but, there is a problem. Vasantha had a slip and fall accident and was on complete bed rest. He appeared to be in bad shape and the daughter requested me to wait for some time. I had to return to Canada and I regret that I could not make it. I miss you Vasantha. You have left behind an aching heart, but also happy memories. In my twilight years, I stay just a stones throw from your eternal abode. We may meet. Till then, Goodbye!

James and Victoria Jesubatham: Beloved parents
Late James and Victoria Jesubatham, my father and mother-in-law, who had given me so much of themselves, passed away on the March 22 and April 1, respectively at the ages of 87 and 82. They rested in peace with Jesus ten days apart, which signifies how unitedly they live closely together for 63 years.
Having losing their first born child Ranjith in 1955 after a brief illness, they brought up their son Raviand and three daughters, Romila, Rajeevo and Ramya, sacrificially, feeding them with higher education and all comforts in life and giving them in marriage to the right life partners. They have seen eight grandchildren and have looked into their welfare as well.Late James Jesubatham worked for A. Baur and Co. Ltd., Colombo, for 50 years, joining in 1947 as a clerical hand and retired as a senior accountant in 1997, which is admirable and a rare record in history books. Likewise, late Victoria Jesubatham started her career as a trained govt. teacher in 1960 and retired as a vice principal in 1990, at the same School; C.C. School in Pusellawa, serving for 30 long years. Their loyal dedication and respect for their jobs is praiseworthy.
They unitedly served and contributed a lot for the smooth run of the Church. Victoria was a senior member of the Holy Trinity Church, Pussellawa and served as an acolyte, assisting the parish priest, ordained by the former Bishop of Kurunegala. She also served as a warden and later, as the treasurer for nearly 12 years.
They helped the poor without exposing themselves as Christ preached and engaged in many social activities. Only in the funeral service orations lead by a Senior Priest, everyone got to know that they donated a very large sum of money towards the Kurunegala diocese to help the poor and needy. A part of that donation was to assist the clergies of the Kurunegala diocese; for their welfare after retirement. Up to now, many benefited by their generous deeds.They both had a special talents of counseling, not only to with family members, but also with teenage and elderly people who sought their help. They were very punctual and methodical in all their activities. They won the hearts of people, showing love and compassion immeasurably. I am proud of both of them as they stood for the right in every instance and maintained a high-quality of lifestyle without giving up each other under any circumstances.
We should console ourselves that they have gone to rest in peace with Jesus in heaven after toiling hard and running their meaningful race setting an example for the next generation. May the good God keep this precious souls in His bosom forever until we meet them in the gates in heaven.

Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud; Visionary leader
.....Therefore, let me assure my Sinhalese countrymen that I am one with them in demanding complete freedom for our country.
They can count on me as one of the most ardent admirers of their legitimate national and cultural aspirations. In me and my community, let them know that they find the most trusted friends and kind neighbours in this island ...
Let me also assure my Sinhalese friends that the brave community to which I have the honour to belong, shall never consider any sacrifice too great, to make Lanka a happy, prosperous and glorious country in the world, where not one section of its population, but every son and daughter of her soil shall legitimately take pride in her glorious destiny...
These inspiring words were spoken by an immaculately dressed young men who addressed an August assembly of the most distinguished leaders of the Muslim community who gathered on March 5, 1939, under the Chairmanship of Sir Mohammed Macan Markar to protest against the inadequate representation of Muslims in Legislative Council, consequent the recommendations of the Donoughmore Commission. The young man was none other than Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud.
With the demise of Dr. Badiuddin Mahmud on June 16, 1997, we have lost not only a great patriot, but also an illustrious national leader respected by all communities of Sri Lanka.
Dr. Mahmud was born in Matara, which was the cradle of some of the most illustrious sons of Ruhuna of the calibre of Cumaratunga Munidasa, the Sinhala poet; Anagarika Dharmapala, the Nationalist; Ven. Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera, the gifted scholar and author of the famous, 'Salalihini Sandeseya' and the great scholar monk Prof. Valpola Rahula Thera. He received his early education at Matara St. Thomas College.
In 1938, addressing Prophet Muhammad's birthday celebrations at Galle, Dr. Mahmud created a sensation by urging Muslims to learn Sinhala.
He said, If this is done, all misunderstandings will disappear and there will be perfect harmony between the Sinhalese and the Moors. Under self-government, which is bound to come sooner or later, the national language of Ceylon should be Sinhalese.
As an educationist and efficient administrator, he immensely contributed towards the educational advancement of his community and it became a reality with the establishment of fully-fledged Gampola Zahira College.
He became the founder Principal under Dr. T.B. Jayah's management. Dr. Mahmud developed Zahira from the state of a dilapidated structure to its present stature, with up-to-date infrastructure facilities.
The contribution he made to Zahira College, Gampola, is an outstanding monument to his yeoman services to Muslim education and he has won him an honoured place in the educational history of the Muslim community.
From his college days at Colombo Zahira, through his University career at Aligarh in India, he has, throughout, shone as a revolutionary in politics, education, culture and in all important issues affecting the masses with whom he moved. In 1933, he was asked to leave Burma within 48 hours after his rousing and forceful speech urging the students to fight British imperialism with all strength and keep Burma for the Burmese.
Only a few are aware of the close friendship between late Premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike and Badiuddin Mahmud.
It was in 1925 that the young Mahmud invited late Premier S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike to address the students of Zahira College, Colombo. He saw, in Bandaranaike, the makings of the future leader of Sri Lanka, and from then on, his association with Bandaranaike became closer.
He became the first General Secretary of the SLFP under the leadership of Bandaranaike and it is well-known that the successful emergence of the party at the general election in 1956 owed a great deal to Dr. Badiuddin's untiring efforts and unflinching loyalty to the party and its leader.
When the government was formed in 1956, much to the disappointment of Bandaranaike, Badiuddin Mahmud declined to accept the offer of a nominated seat in Parliament and a Cabinet portfolio, because he thought, at the time, that by being outside the government, he could serve his community better. However, he served as a member of the National Planning Council and represented Sri Lanka four times at the United Nations and held the office of Vice-Chairman of its third committee in 1959.
After the SLFP victory in 1960, at the insistence of Late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, he accepted nomination to Parliament and was made the Minister of Education and Broadcasting.
As Minister of Education, his name will go down in the history as the man who gave significance to the principle of equality of opportunity in education for all by taking over the assisted schools in the teeth of opposition by vested interests.
Dr. Mahmud re-organized the schools and the system of education to suit our national needs. He courageously brought out sweeping changes in education like the introduction of technical education to rural schools and gave them science laboratories and workshops.
He appointed the National Education Commission and the Technical Education Commission and laid the foundation of a truly national system of education. For the services he rendered to the country in the field of education, he was conferred the Doctorate of Literature by the then Vidyodaya University and Doctorate of Laws by the Vidyalankara University.
Subsequently, as Minister of Health and Housing, he took a major step in them in the interest of the common people by abolishing private practice and the introduction of the channelled system, despite opposition from the influential quarters.
Dr. Mahmud adopted many drastic measures to improve the health facilities in the urban and rural areas and also improved the facilities for Ayurvedic Researches.
Dr. Mahmud was a true national leader who always associated with the Sinhalese people in the struggle for independence.
He was not only an admirer of the Sinhalese people and their history, but also fully shared with them, their aspirations for a united Sri Lanka without divisions of any kind, be they communal, territorial, political or religious.

Dr. Michael Joachim: Down-to-earth engineer
It was sad, the passing away of old Benedictine Dr. Michael Joachim, an engineer, after a brief illness. He was fun and bonhomie till the end and was his usual jovial self till death struck cruelly and silently to take away from this world, a great and sincere friend, benefactor and above all, a down to earth man, although he could have flaunted his plumes, considering his doctorate and engineering skills and being the son of another old Ben and doctor A.W.R. Joachim the first Ceylonese doctor of Agriculture.
Dr. Michael was the Chairman of the CIDA with many more years to serve the country and his profession when sudden death struck like a thief in the night. He was in great demand during the Presidency of the late Ranasinghe Premadasa and was one of pioneering architects of the late Presidents Gam Udawa concept. Another of Michaels foresight and construction was the Fish Market in Pettah which has been unfortunately demolished and where now stands the Gold Centre. President Premadasas son Sajith, who followed his fathers every step, realized the potential and appointed him Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation and then CIDA where he served with excellency and honesty. Sajith will certainly miss him.
Hailing from an illustrious family, he was the son of former old Ben late Dr. A.W.R. Joachim, who was the first Ceylonese Director of Agriculture. After a brilliant career as a student at St. Benedicts College, Kotahena, where he excelled in studies, carrying away many prizes in his pitch of study, he also showed his prowess in sports, being a good tennis player and a big-hitting, fast-bowling all rounder and a top sprinter in the late 1950s. He also took part in the Public Schools Athletic Meet, which was the showcase of schools athletics at that time.
In cricket, his teammates were Lionel Fernando, Elmo Rodrigopulle, Allan Gunesekera, Nihal Amerasinghe, Quintus Perera, Cyri Ernest, Ranjit Perumal, to name a few and in tennis, Lasantha Fernando and Cyril Ernest. In athletics he ran in the feared company of Kenneth Dabrera and others.
Dr. Michael was a proud boarder at SBC and was a sincere and dear friend of mine because I too, was a boarder. Many were the wonderful moments we spent in each others company, discussing studies, sports and above all, he was sincere in discussing what he could do for his school and country. Simple and unassuming as he was, everyone, to him, was a friend. He would go out of his way to help a fellow student or his team mates in tennis and cricket and he was a true friend indeed.
He would be present at every function of the college and always took time off his many onerous duties to proffer advice, guidance and support for college activities and was a founder of the college development fund.
Dr. Michael would walk with kings, but would be always be down-to-earth and he could have had the best of five-star hotel food, but he would always tell me that the best meal he enjoyed was in a 'bath kade' or a hopper market. Such was his simplicity. I can vouch for this because there were many times I kept his company in one these markets.
In addition to his excellence in studies, he was handsome and there were many girls at the adjoining Good Shepherd Convent who would give him glad eyes. But he reserved his dying and eternal love to a beauty Estelle Joseph and what a grand and enviable couple they made.
Michael and Estelle had a daughter Janice and son David. He was given a grand burial by his numerous school mates and religious dignitaries who were present in their numbers in respect and admiration for what he did for his school and its progress and development.
Goodbye my dear friend, till we meet on that beautiful shore.

Asia Pacific businesses poised for major digital transformation - Hitachi
Hu Yoshida, Global Chief Technology Officer of Hitachi Data Systems Corporation (HDS), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hitachi Ltd. shared the key businesses and technology trends for Asia Pacific in 2017 at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo, recently.
Digital transformation is fast becoming an organizational issue. It is no longer just CIOs who are championing the need for digital change, but leaders across all business functions. For example, CMOs are finding that traditional ways of marketing are not as effective any more, while CFOs are discovering that consumer and supplier transaction models are shifted. There is now an almost universal understanding within businesses that all functions need to look at how they transform their own practices through digitization, said Yoshida.
There are five key findings based on the 2016 survey sponsored by HDS. Enterprises in APAC generally believe they are further ahead in their digital transformation journeys than their global counterparts.One is productivity gains will be more about people, process and business outcomes; accelerating transition to cloud; bi-modal IT; a centralized data hub and the last, findings will be growing awareness of IoT in the Data Centre.
The integration of IT and OT with analytics is the first step. Today, IoT requires data scientists and researchers with deep domain expertise and most projects are in the proof-of-concept stage. This year, we will be at the stage where we have the recipe for IoT projects, like train-as-a-service or industry 4.0. Hitachi Data Systems, along with other divisions in Hitachi and outside partners, is developing an IoT core platform, Lumada, to develop these recipes and deliver baked IoT solutions that are open, adaptable, verified and secure, said Yoshida.
Yoshida adds, This years trends are being driven by a clear enterprise demand to deliver on all the promises of digital transformation, with APAC set to lead the way. Regardless of industry, IT is seeing a fundamental shift as enterprises embrace the new revenue streams, efficiencies and possibilities provided by digitization.

Battle against kidney diseases intensified: Two modern medical labs to be set up in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa
Nimal Wijesinghe, Anuradhapura Additional District Group Corr.
Two well-equipped medical laboratories will be set up in Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa to diagnose people suffering from kidney diseases.
Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Palitha Bandara said those who are unaware that they are suffering from kidney ailments will be encouraged to have their blood tested via the two centers.
The two labs will be set up at the Anuradhapura Chest Hospital and at the Polonnaruwa District Health Services Directors Office.
The construction of two labs will cost Rs. 25 million. Dr. Bandara said around 1,200 persons will be tested per day at the labs. Two laboratory technicians were recruited for the DPHS Office in this regard, he said.
According to our latest surveys, the number of kidney patients in the NCP is around 15,800. Many of them were detected in Kebithigollewa, Mahawilachchiya, Rambewa, Medawachchiya, Padaviya, Dimbulagala, Welikanda, and Medirigiriya. We have launched a divisional level blood testing programme to identify kidney patients. It is being initiated from the Mahawilachchiya DS division to test 12,000 persons and we have finished 2,000 to date. The 29 MOH offices were entrusted with this programme, Dr. Bandara said.

From border village to changing the world with piece of thread
Dr. Anura Rathnayake, the Sri Lankan scientist who is a product of the University of Moratuwa, was able to win the 3rd place at the Global Change Award organised annually by the H&M Foundation with his revolutionary innovation Content Thread, which facilitates sorting and recycling of clothes using a digital thread.
The competition was carried out in order to encourage the introduction of game changing new technologies that are safe, sustainable and promote climate positivity. This prestigious event was held on April 5 at the City Hall in Stockholm, Sweden, which is also world famous for hosting the Nobel Peace Prize banquet each year.
Dr. Anura Rathnayake, who went off to win the world despite of the fact he was born in a remote border village in Sri Lanka, developed his concept and competed against approximately 3,000 revolutionary technological concepts presented by 130 countries including the United States, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan.
His bold creativity and disruptive innovation that made the Content Thread concept stand out among other innovations and brought immense pride to the motherland is truly an inspiration to everyone. His concept addresses one of the major barriers in textile recycling, which is not knowing what the clothes are made of.
Even though natural ingredients are mostly used in manufacturing textile, at the end of its life cycle, they are thrown into the waste system making the Textile Industry the second biggest contributor to pollution. Attempts taken to recycle the textile waste deem useless mainly because of the complexity of the ingredients used to produce ready-made products. When a garment is sorted incorrectly when recycling, it can obstruct the whole recycling process and all these facts have turned Textile Recycling an expensive and a difficult task.
This is where the Content Thread concept comes in. In this concept, by attaching a digital tag to each garment at manufacturing stage, a digitised ingredients list that gives recyclers all the information needed to recycle the garment are created.The tag which is in the form of an RFID thread, looks and feels much like a normal thread and lasts over the garments lifetime, driving economic improvements that reduce waste throughout the entire supply chain, and powering the recycling process at end of life. The Content Thread will save precious natural resources, help reinvent and speed up the shift to a circular waste-free fashion industry and could be used in a wide range of fields such as medical, automotive, military, naval among others.
The Global Change Award judge board as well as world famous researchers believe that this indeed will be the start of a new era in the Textile and Fashion Designing Industry.
Dr. Rathnayakes road to success was a rather rough and filled with obstacles and his life story of how he suffered to become a man who revolutionises the world leave us awed. Rathnayake Mudiyanselage Anura Sarathchandra Rathnayake lived in a remote border village called Nikawewa in the Welioya area, which was under the terrorists grip for three decades. He is the eldest of four and received his primary education from Buddhangala Madhya Maha Vidyalaya in Padaviya, Parakramapura.
In a time and society where education was merely a dream, he made it his sole aim to win in life with immense interest and effort in studies. Neither the cruel war nor the oppression could destroy his tenacity. Dr. Rathnayake passed the G. C. E. Advanced Levels Examination in the Mathematics stream with excellent grades and may have been the only student from a remote border village who was selected to the Engineering Faculty of the University of Moratuwa then.
He recalls the financial support he received in order to successfully carry out his graduate studies from the philanthropists retired Brig. Galgamuwa, Brig. Harangoda and Nayomi Perera with respect and gratitude. Considering poverty to be a blessing to his life, he went on to become one of the brightest students in the University of Moratuwa and received his Bachelor of Science in Engineering in 2002. In year 2004, he moved to England and received his Master of Science in Engineering in 2007 from the University of Bolton. Not stopping there, on June 21, 2015, he received his Postgraduate Degree related to new researches and his Doctorate Degree related to new dimension of electronic, smart textiles from the Nottingham Trent University in England, crowning himself with the highest qualification in his education journey.
Dr. Rathnayake, who is committed to revealing his path to success to children in his own village, organise and conduct seminars for Ordinary Level students in remote schools in the Welioya area along with his fellow scholars every year. During his studies in Nottingham Trent University he awarded scholarships to several students from the Welioya area who were granted university entrance yet again proving his humanitarian qualities.
Recently Supporters for Innovations organisation held a ceremony to felicitate Dr.Anura Rathnayake at the hotel Nippon in Colombo. The chief guest on the occasion was Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka. In addition to Minister Ranawaka, Dean Faculty of Engineering at the Moratuwa University, Prof. K.K.C.K. Perera, Veteran Actor Sathischandra Edirisinghe, Media Advisor to the Sri Lanka Army Sisira Wijesinghe were among the speakers.

British woman  stranded after Lankan husband shot dead
A British woman says she is stranded in Sri Lanka after selling her home and marrying a local who was shot dead.
Diane De Zoysa, 59, says she gave 100,000 to husband Priyanjana, 26, when she moved to live with him in Ahungalla, in the south west of the country, last year.
She met the hotel worker when she was on holiday in the country six years ago, before returning seven months later to marry him.
However, her husband was killed last month after being shot three times at a friends house.
De Zoysa, who previously worked as a customer support worker at Edinburgh City Council, says her husband was murdered by men trying to blackmail him for money.
She said: They thought he was a rich man as he had a nice house, a minibus and a tuk-tuk. He paid them but they wanted more.
The widow explained how she had sold her home in Edinburgh to live with her husband in Sri Lanka last year.
She then bought a house in the country in her husbands familys name, as well as helping him set up a minibus service.
De Zoysa said: My husband and his family are poor, so I have helped them. I gave up everything to join my husband here. I never imagined that I would be at my husbands funeral. I thought that I would die first, seeing as Im a lot older than him. De Zoysa says she misses her husband every day, posting a tribute to him on Facebook ahead of his birthday.
She wrote: Happy Birthday for tomorrow my darling husband. I wish you were here so I could give you a big hug and lots of kisses.
Forever in my heart I will always love you.
Sharing a photograph of their wedding day in 2012, she added: I miss him every day.
De Zoysa says she is desperate to return to Scotland following her husbands death, but is unable to do so due to her financial situation.

Buddhism not an extremist religion: PM
Sri Lanka as a Buddhist nation gained international prestige by successfully conducting the UN Vesak Day festival recently. While engaging in such activities we should also try to protect and safeguard Buddhism without leaving room for any misgivings about Buddhism, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Irrespective of whether we belong to the Buddhist clergy or laity, we should not create the impression that Buddhism is an extremist religion by word or deed. Violence and extremism had no place in Buddhism. For that matter, extremism had no place in any religion, he said.
"We have witnessed the damage caused by spreading extremist ideas into religion when the Western world too is deeply interested in Buddhism. We should protect Buddhism from extremists," Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister expressed there sentiments addressing the gathering at the Upasampada (High ordination) ceremony of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya held at the Kalutara Bodhi complex on June 25.
The Prime Minister said the western world which was in the international forefront in the sphere of technology including information technology, was using machines to study and investigate the human mind.
"The Western world including US, UK and Germany as well as other European countries had immense wealth. But many of their people have faced problems regarding worldly life such as what end result could be gained by powerful nations by war, unlimited worldly pleasure and luxury and so on. They were searching for a feasible alternative for all these," the Premier said.
"This was where they get inclined towards Buddhism. There was a large number of Buddhists in the UK today. The Buddhist temples there were being maintained with the assistance of Englishmen who were Buddhist," he added.
He said, German people were more inclined towards Buddhism. All of them were now paying special attention toward Theravada Buddhism. They learn Buddhism with the help of books and journal. The Western world was turning towards Buddhism because it rejected greed, enmity, hatred and violence. Our duty today was to spread Buddhism with greater vigour and enthusiasm.
The Prime Minister said during his recent visit to New York, a friend came to meet him. The friend told him that he had purchased an old church building which is being used for Buddhist missionary activities. When asked as to how he managed to raise necessary funds, the friend told him that since Buddhists were few and far between, a majority of the residents who were non Buddhist Americans assisted him because they were interested in Buddhism.
Wickremesinghe said the Amarapura Nikaya had rendered a great service towards the revival of Buddhism since the 19th Century.
It was the Nikaya's first Upasampada ceremony presided over by Ven. Kotugoda Dhmmavasa Thera in his capacity as the new Mahanayake Thera and he was privileged and happy to attend the ceremony presided by the new Mahanayake Thera.
Wickremesinghe said he had a association with the new Mahanayake Thera for a very long time and the would extend his greetings and good wishes to new Mahanayake Thera.

Carter would support his son's boy band dream
Nick Carter would support his son if he wanted to follow in his footsteps by joining a boy band.
The 37-year-old has been in the industry since the tender age of 10, and hit the big time with group Backstreet Boys. While the group are currently enjoying a new lease of life thanks to a residency in Las Vegas, Nick's personal life is also keeping him busy - namely his 14-month-old son Odin.
When it comes to raising the tot, whose mother is Nick's wife Lauren Kitt, the singer is "already expecting" the day that Odin turns round and says he wants to be in a pop group.
"If he comes to me and says that (he wants to be in a boy band), that'll be one of those things where I've just gotta support him and guide him in the right things to do," Nick told Entertainment Tonight. "Because that's the thing about the entertainment business, it can be dangerous at times, and if you're not supported by your family, you can get in trouble."
He is now turning his talents to the small screen, acting as an "architect" on upcoming TV talent show Boy Band. Nick, former Spice Girls star Emma Bunton and Grammy Award winning producer Timbaland will be hunting for talented singers who will form part of America's next big male singing troupe.
And his time with the Backstreet Boys means that Nick is well aware of just what factors are required to make a successful group.
"The bad boy, the young one, the older one," he listed when asked what he's looking for to make up the band. He also added that his own role in the Backstreet Boys has "evolved" over the years."I guess I kind of started pretty, then I went a little bad," he smiled. "And then I kind of got a little more mature, and so I'm a little more responsible now. I went through all the phases of every single boy. I guess that's me." Music News

The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) was made to bear an additional cost of Rs. 33.8 billion from January to May due to high dependency on oil to generate power during the prolonged dry spell, Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
Addressing a press conference at his ministry premises today Siyambalapitiya said the Treasury had provided Rs 6 billion to cover the additional cost.
He added that the recent floods and landslides had also caused a loss of nearly Rs 300 million to the CEB. Observing that the power supply of 770,000 consumers was affected due to disaster situation, he said the CEB workers worked round the clock to restore supply within a short period.
He also said despite the monsoon rains in the Southwestern part of the country, the water level in many reservoirs was not satisfactory.
The total reservoir storage is about 47 percent now, and this percentage was high over 70 percent in other years. We still need the support of public to use the electricity sparingly, he said.
Siyambalapitiya said the Government in the next two months would open tenders to add about 890 MW to the national grid to cater to the power demand predicted in 2020.
He added this includes 100 MW LNG plant, 220MW solar power plants and 170 MW wind power plants.
The Power and Energy Ministry in the wake of recent controversies on coal procurement has decided to open a special RTI unit to provide requested information to the public.
Through this unit we will give out any information we can legally provide, the minister said.
Ministry Secretary B M S Batagoda said coal procurements are now being done adhering to the cleanest, most transparent and the fastest method.
He said another coal tender would be opened next week.

Change cultural mindset for SL to become  Small Miracle - Former deputy governor
Sri Lanka needs to get into an economic policy capsule with participation from politicians, bureaucrats, academia, and civil society organizations, to map out strategy for developing the talent pool of the country needed by 2025, 2035 and 2045, former Central Bank Deputy Governor W.A. Wijewardena said.
He was speaking at the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transportation (CILT) Sri Lanka Logistics Leaders Evening, held recently, with a lecture titled Sri Lankas Competitiveness  A Tiger or a Small Miracle.
According to Wijewardena, it is necessary to sign off the strategy with time-bound key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor progress, rectify deviations and plan out for emerging developments.
It is neither Tiger nor Small Miracle for Sri Lanka unless a massive reform program is implemented with consistency, consensus, dedication and commitment, he said.
Despite government projections of 7% minimum growth, it is only likely that Sri Lanka will achieve somewhere between 5%-5.5% growth rate till 2020 with the current state of affairs.
He highlighted the example of Singapores forward-thinking mindset that allowed a small state to become a global economic powerhouse.
A deeper evaluation of the current situation revealed that the biggest reason why Sri Lanka is lagging behind is a need to change our cultural mindset to be more modern and hardworking, to rethink how education is delivered and to leapfrog four cycles of the industrial revolution in order to become relevant, he said.
Commenting on economic reforms on a wide scale, he pointed out the need to make the private sector move the country forward, introduce measures to improve productivity and efficiency of using both human and physical capital and create a bigger market for Sri Lankan products to move out of the current middle-income trap towards becoming a high-income nation.

China accuses India of border incursion

China has accused India of a border incursion between the state of Sikkim and Tibet, warning the development could "threaten peace" on the border.
Ongoing tensions over the past weeks have already led Beijing to block the border for official pilgrimages.
The border region saw clashes between China and India in 1967.
A spokesman with China's foreign ministry said Indian border guards "obstructed normal activities" by the Chinese military and demanded that India withdraw immediately.
The Nathu La pass on the border between Sikkim and Tibet connects India to Hindu and Buddhist sites in the region and is traditionally used by Indians for pilgrimages to those sites.
According to Indian media, tensions between the border guards from both sides have been ongoing for the past weeks, with Chinese troops allegedly crossing into Sikkim and destroying two make-shift Indian army bunkers.
The region has continued to be a source of tension between India and China.
China claims the state of Arunachal Pradesh as its own territory and strongly objected to an Indian decision to allow Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama to visit.
It then renamed six districts in the region, in a move seen as "retaliation".
Beijing also warned that India's inauguration of a bridge connecting Arunachal Pradesh with the north-eastern state of Assam in May, was the "development of military infrastructure in a disputed province".

They were fined a total of US$1.25 million. Three others who were granted bail in November were neither fined nor jailed.
The casino company and Australias consul general in Shanghai announced the verdicts after the half-day trial was held behind closed doors at Baoshan District Court. A court official confirmed the ruling to AFP.
Gaming is illegal in China and companies are not allowed explicitly to advertise gambling but few details of the accusations have been released since last years arrests.
The Australian government has monitored this case very closely, Consul General Graeme Meehan told reporters outside the courthouse.
We will be continuing to provide consular assistance to the Australians and their families for as long as thats required, he said.
Two of the 19 who were put on trial are former staff members. In addition to the Australians, 15 are Chinese and one is Malaysian.
Five were sentenced to 10 months while 11 received nine-month jail terms.
Jason OConnor, the executive vice president of Crown division VIP International in charge of luring rich Chinese to Australia, was given a 10-month jail term and a two million yuan (US$292,000) fine.
The two other Australians, Pan Dan and Jerry Xuan, were given nine-month sentences and 400,000 yuan (US$58,000) and 200,000 yuan (US$29,000) fines, respectively. The Crown staffers were suspected of arranging junkets overseas for wealthy Chinese gamblers. (www.dailymail.co.uk)

Cilic eyes Wimbledon charge
LONDON AFP June 25: Marin Cilic insists he is primed to make a strong run for the Wimbledon title despite the frustration of his Queen's Club final defeat against Feliciano Lopez.
Cilic was denied a second Queen's crown in agonising fashion on Sunday as the world number seven failed to convert a match point in the final set tie-break before losing 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 7-6 (10/8).
Lifting the trophy at the Wimbledon warm-up event would have been perfect preparation for the Croatian ahead of the grass-court Grand Slam, which starts on July 3.
But Cilic is confident the dominant form he showed for the rest of the tournament will stand him in good stead at Wimbledon, where the former US Open champion has lost in the quarter-finals three years in a row.
I'm playing really well. Definitely I'm going to get to Wimbledon with good determination, good confidence, Cilic said.
I've worked a lot to get to this level. I'm looking forward to the tournament. Definitely hoping that I can go further than the last three years.
I played a lot of matches on grass. Played high-quality tennis. It's also a matter of executing things well on the court. That's where my focus is going to be. With Wimbledon champion Andy Murray crashing out of Queen's in the first round, a result that continued the world number one's disappointing 2017, and Novak Djokovic in equally poor form, Cilic acknowledged there is good opportunity for someone outside the big four to take the trophy.
Roger Federer will arrive as tournament favourite after maintaining his superb run by winning the Halle title on Sunday, but French Open champion Rafael Nadal hasn't thrived at Wimbledon for several years.
All the other guys at the top didn't perform too well, and definitely that opens up a gap, Cilic said. Roger didn't play much, so it's tough to know his form. You know, just looking at the results he has on grass, it's obvious that you have to put him up there.

Issuance of defaced currency notes
I refer to the news item that was published in an English daily of June 19 captioned as CBSL not to accept defaced currency notes from December and wish to pen a few words in this regard. If this law is implemented, definitely the blind people and the senior citizens will be victimised.
Currently state banks and other commercial banks accept mutilated currency notes only from their customers subject to the paste-them-on-a-white-paper on which placing their signature and the account numbers so that the bank could debit the respective accounts when they were returned by the Central Bank for any reason.
I feel that banks have to make payment only from their sorted cash without taking daily collections for this purpose. The banks have to play a major role in this regard. They have to sort out the cash before they are sent to the Central Bank. If they do not execute this job properly, the circulation of defaced currency notes in the country is unavoidable. On the other hand, cash-counting machines, used by the banks, do not reject the defaced currency notes.
The customers who draw money from the banks, in large amounts, are not in a position to check them all one by one very carefully to make sure if they are in good condition.
I wish to state that the Central Bank should make awareness programmes in this regard before the new rule is implemented.

Colombia boat wreck sinking: 9 dead, 31 missing
GUATAMALA: At least nine people were dead and 31 missing after a tourist boat sank in a reservoir in northwestern Colombia on Sunday, the countrys president said.
Authorities did not yet say what caused the four-deck Almirante to go down in the El Penol reservoir in the tourist town of Guatape, where Colombian and foreign tourists take leisure cruises.
There are nine people deceased so far and 31 reported missing, Santos told reporters in Guatape, after the regional government earlier gave a death toll of at least nine.
An official in the National Risk Management Unit, Carlos Ivan Marquez, confirmed the toll of six separately to AFP. He said they were all Colombians, and no minors. Regional authorities said the boat was carrying 170 people, most of whom were rescued by other boats or escaped by themselves.
It sank extremely quickly. It all happened in a few minutes, said a fire service captain involved in the rescue effort, Luis Bernardo Morales.
One helicopter from the air force and two from the army went to help in rescue operations, the military said. The reservoir is 68 kilometers (40 miles) from the city of Medellin and is one of Antioquia departments main tourist draws.
One woman who survived, Laura Baquero, said on television that the two lower decks were too crowded and the passengers were not wearing lifejackets.
We started to feel like the boat was going to capsize, she said.
She said there were lots of children on board.
Santos said he had been told the boat had a capacity greater than the number of people on board, so that it was not due to overloading that it sank. He said naval experts had come to investigate the cause and divers would continue searching for people all night.
The Antioquia regional government said on Twitter that 24 people caught in the wreck were being treated in hospital. - AFP

Constitutional Protection of Environment: the role of the Judiciary Green code
As proclaimed in Vienna Declaration on Human Rights in 1993, democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedom are inter- dependent requiring attending to developmental and environmental needs of the present and future generations. Today societys interaction with nature is so extensive so that environmental issues have assumed proportions affecting all humanity. With the industrial and technological development, mankind have not only improved economic conditions but also altered the natural ecological balance.
Sri Lankas environmental law is a curious mixture of civil law and common law principles derived from Roman Dutch law and English law, statute law juristic writings and judge made law. As a result, there is a multiplicity of jurisdictions and institutions in the environmental arena. The judiciary has shown a keen interest in the development of environmental law. Natural resources are managed through the law. Laws provide the tools and the framework for its management. The numerous tasks of management including policy making, enforcement, application of management techniques and tools and the making of specific decisions have to be performed within that framework.
The 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka contains several provisions relating to environment. For an example, Article 27(14 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka) states that it is duty of the State to protect, preserve, and improve the environment for the benefit of the community. In addition, Article 28 (f) of the Constitution makes it fundamental duty of every person to protect nature and conserve its riches. These provisions however, are not set out in the Chapter on fundamental rights: they are to be found in the Chapter entitled Directive Principles of State Policy and fundamental duties and are not enforceable in a Court of Law in terms of Article 29 of the Constitution.
The 13th Amendment to the Constitution has introduced a new level of institutions between the Central Government and the Local Governments. Accordingly, in terms of item 37 of the Provincial Council List of the 9th Schedule to the Constitution, the Provincial Council can take action on the protection of environment within the Province to the extent permitted by or under the law made by Parliament. Moreover, the protection of environment is an item found in item 33 of the Concurrent List (List III) of the 9th Schedule to the 13th Amendment. Under this Provision, both National Government and Provincial Councils can take legislative and executive action on this subject having complied with the Provisions made thereon. Further Appendix II of the Provincial Council List provides for National Land Commission to be set up by the Government of Sri Lanka. This National Land Commission would be responsible for the formulation of national policy with regard to the use of State land. The provision for national land commission further stipulates in item 3.4 that in the exercise of the powers devolved on Provincial Councils, the power shall be exercised by the Provincial Councils having regard to the national policy formulated by the National Land Commission. The essence of the above provisions found in the 13th Amendment is that Provincial Council may take legislative and executive action within the Province to the extent permitted by or under the law made by Parliament.
The key environmental law at the statutory level in Sri Lanka is the National Environmental Act No.47 of 1980 as amended which has introduced both EIA and EPL procedures. Apart from this Act, there are many other sectoral statutes that deal with specific areas of resources or development activity.
Concept of trusteeship
The Doctrine of Public Trust is an important legal principle which has its roots relating to environment and public law. The duty cast on the State to protect and conserve the environment for the benefit of the people is not a new concept that was introduced with the enactment of the 1978 Constitution. In the Danube River case then Vice President of the International Court of Justice C.G Weeramantry J, referred to the conversation of King Devanampiyatissa (247 -207 BC) and Arahat Mahinda dating back to the 3rd century BC. The excerpts from the said conversation is given below:
Or great king, the birds of the air and the beasts have as equal rights to live and move about in any part of the land as thou. The lands belong to the people and all living beings; thou art only the guardian of it  (Mahawansa; Chapter XIV).
Utility of the Public Trust Doctrine in Sri Lanka
The Supreme Court utilizes this Doctrine as a potential tool for a multitude of purposes: (a) to rectify the abuse of discretionary power, (b) to prevent the exploitation of natural resources and (c) to shield the under- privileged.
(a). A tool to rectify abuse of discretionary power
It is an essential reality in Sri Lanka that legislature cannot legislate for every possible circumstance. In consequence, the conferring of discretionary power upon public official is essential. However, such discretionary power so conferred are not unlimited, unconstrained power. Unfortunately at present there is an misunderstanding that the term discretion is synonymous with unrestricted power. Discretionary power must be understood to mean to power to decide an approximate mode of action in a given context but only so far as such power is exercised for the benefit of the public. The Supreme Court echoes this sentiment in Palihawadana v AG and Two Others by observing that when a power is entrusted to a very high and responsible officer, he may be expected to act reasonably, objectively and without bias while discharging his duties. When a public officials exceeds his disciplinary powers the Court on the basis of public trust doctrine can hold such person accountable for his actions.
(b). As a tool to prevent exploitation of natural resources
In Bulnakulama v Secretary Ministry of Industrial Development, the notion of trusteeship was invoked in relation to natural resources as opposed to public power. In this case the Supreme Court concluded that the Government is the trustee of natural resources of the country. Being such a trustee, the State has an obligation to protect these resources for public use and from exploitation by individuals for private commercial gain. Bulankulama Judgment recognized the right to sustainable development and the obligation of the State to respect the principle of inter generational equity in exploiting natural resources and granted redress through the somewhat restricted parameters of the constitutional Chapter on Fundamental Rights. Recognizing that there are many operational definitions of sustainable development that are variations of the definitions of use by the Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development (1987), the Court went on to identify three main principles encompassed by that concept: (a) conservation of natural resources having regard to the principle of inter- generation equity (b) exploitation of natural resources in a sustainable manner (c) integration of environmental considerations into development programmes.
Of particular significance is the Courts stipulation that the proposed agreement should be reviewed within the framework of international environmental law. The Court found that Sri Lanka, as a member of the United Nations, could hardly ignore environmental requirements in the Stockhom Declaration (1972) and Rio Declaration (1992). Justice Amarasinghe went on to state: the inter generational principles in my view, should be regarded as axiomatic in the decision making process in relation to matters concerning the natural resources and the environment of Sri Lanka in general and particularly in the case before us. It is not something new to us.
The Doctrine also plays an immense role with regard to inter- generational equity which in its simplistic based terms can be described as equality between generations. Inter  generational equity with regard to natural resources entails the notion that one generation must act as guardians of natural resources in trust for the next and future generations. By acknowledging an obligation on the part of the public officials to use and preserve resources in a manner that is consistent with public trust, inter- generational equality will also result in the adoption of practices that contribute sustainable development through the reasonable use of natural resources and preservation of conservation of the environment. When the State fails to safeguard against private and commercial exploitation of common natural resources and degradation of the environment it also fails to fullfil its obligation as a public trustee. Thus it is imperative that public officials are fully aware of the implications of their exercise of public power in this regard.
(c). A shield for the under privileged
Public Trust Doctrine also serves as a shield for the under - privileged. This Doctrine may be used to facilitate the Rule of Law, thereby serving as a shield to protect the minorities and the under- privileged. Public Trust Doctrine dictates that any person or officials that exercises collective power does so because such power which is vested in the people is entrusted to them. Therefore ensuring dignity and respect for all regardless of their socio economic standing and belief is a logical extension of the Doctrine as well.
Sustainable development
Several decades ago, public international law was not much concerned with environmental protection. Later, the Stockholm Declaration of 1972 and subsequent international instruments have enriched the international community on the subject. The term Sustainable Development which includes inter-generational equity was brought into common use by the Brundtland Commission Report in 1987. The Rio Declaration of 1992 which refers to the right to sustainable development seeks to bridge the gap between environmental protection and economic development. Recently, the Paris Agreement of 2016 which deals with global climate change also stipulates that the human right to development is not unlimited and must be perused within the framework of sustainable development.
Our Supreme Court in Heather Therese Mundy v Central Environmental Authority and Others has stated that the Courts have to balance the right to development and the right to environmental protection. While development activity is necessary and inevitable for the sustainable development of a nation, unfortunately, it impacts the rights of the private individuals but such is the inevitable sad sacrifice that has to be made for the progress of a nation. The Court can only minimize as much as possible the effects to such rights. When balancing the competing interests between public rights and private rights, the conclusion necessarily has to be made in favour of the larger interests of the community who would benefit immensely by such developments.
Our 1978 Constitution by Fundamental Rights Chapter III even by its later amendments does not surprisingly contain human right to environment or sustainable development despite extensive literature and dialogue on it. Therefore fundamental rights, both procedural and substantive found in our Chapter III of the Constitution are at times applied indirectly to the tribute to the Judiciary, facing legal difficulties as remedies for environmental issues.
A need has therefore arisen and developments taking place towards the emergence of a separate human right  fundamental right to sustainable development  to strongly address environmental issues. This study advocates a right to sustainable development as a fundamental human right for Sri Lanka under the proposed Constitution.

De Villiers  to decide future in August
CARDIFF: AB de Villiers left South Africa's tour of England saying he would decide his cricket future in August.
One of the outstanding batsmen of his generation, the 33-year-old headed home after captaining the Proteas in a 19-run defeat by England in Cardiff on Sunday that saw them beaten 2-1 in a three-match Twenty20 series.
They previously lost a one-day international series to England by the same scoreline and then suffered a hugely disappointing first-round exit at the Champions Trophy. But a Test series against England is the centrepiece of a four-month tour.
However, it has long been planned that de Villiers would miss the four-Test campaign to take a break from the strain of being one of the world's leading players in all three international formats, as well as a man in demand at lucrative Twenty20 franchise events around the world.
Bangladesh are due to tour South Africa in September and de Villiers said he expected to know by then what his international workload would entail. I am going to meet with CSA (Cricket South Africa) in August, and that will decide my (international) future, de Villiers told reporters after making a typically dashing 35 off 19 balls.
- 'Won't pick and choose' We will see what works for both parties, added the gifted shotmaker, who has scored more than 8,000 runs in 106 Tests, including 21 hundreds, at an average of over 50.

Docs threaten  to strike again
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday threatened to strike again starting today (Tuesday), if they do not not receive a positive response to a request to amend several clauses in the media release issued by the Government on Sunday which it says contain terms and conditions that the government will impose on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Secretary Haritha Aluthge yesterday said the government release included certain clauses which the GMOA had not agreed to and added that the Association was looking forward to a positive response from the government to its request to make the necessary amendments.
Speaking at a media briefing at the GMOA Headquarters yesterday, Aluthge said that President Maithripala Sirisena agreed to present a permanent solution to the issue related to the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and that the GMOA has confidence in the President. The Secretary said that the trade union action on Saturday was suspended only due to receiving a positive response at the discussion held with President Maithripala Sirisena.
He further requested the President to appoint an efficient Health Minister and to extended the services of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) President Prof. Carlo Fonseka so as to avoid creating a favourable situation for the present Health Minister to act according to his own will.
The Secretary also said that they would act on behalf of the aggrieved university students to obtain justice for them through an independent commission. GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr.Nalinda Herath said that the Government should not remand university students under false accusations of damaging the public property and the remanded students should be bailed out.
GMAO Spokesperson Dr.Samantha Ananda further said that there were certain politicians along with several members of civil society movements who block even the President and the Prime Minister in finding a permanent and sustainable solution to the SAITM issue.

Dr. Saman Kelegama, being an eminent economist and erudite scholar in Sri Lanka, provided insightful advocacy and guidance in execution of the tasks of the government on the wider economic arena of international trade.
This was under the committee of the proposed agency for international trade which was established by the government with the prime objective of immediately synchronizing the trade and investment nexus in the economic policy agenda of the government to benefit people of the country through new employment and increased income.
Articulation and implementation of the trade policy has been historically scattered and spread over many agencies. This mostly resulted in the development of 'ad hoc' and often conflicting rules, regulations and practices affecting adversely on the expansion of trade and making few to benefit from international trade.
Dr. Kelegama provided the required leadership in the Committee which included the heads of all trade-related agencies of the government and representatives of the private sector in the Committee of International Trade to bring all inter-related policy as well as cross-institutional elements to a single platform. Formulation of a new trade policy, negotiation of preferential trade agreements, creation of national export promotion strategy, introducing the much awaited in-house legislative and regulatory mechanism related to international trade of Sri Lanka, strengthening trade facilitation, introducing the required modalities to address internal and external non-tariff measures, have been some of the salient initiatives undertaken in the relatively shorter period of his tenure since December 2015.
Under his strong research background, he was also instrumental in preparing a number of studies on costs and benefits of FTAs and has guided the relevant agencies to undertake several initiatives such as reforming the standards and regulations related to imports & exports in developing trade liberalisation programme for Sri Lanka under various FTAs, leading to formulate the mechanism to prepare negative list/sensitive list on a objectively-driven systematic, economic criteria for the first time ever, being underway.
Dr. Kelegamas professional engagement with the Ministry was in addition to his role at the Institute Policy Studies as Executive Director, the position he held until his demise.
His long-term collaborations as a member of the professional networks facilitated by World Bank, ADB, UNDP, UNIDO, ILO, UN-ESCAP, Commonwealth Secretariat and his deliberations made at a wider range of international fora, his international experience as one of the top regional trade economist with reputation and recognition among academia, research community and policy makers and his life-long grip as a fulltime Sri Lankan professional living in the country, has been advantageous in negotiating the country's specific elements. The enormous contribution made by Dr. Kelegama to the enhancement of international trade will benefit the country.

Expressions of artistic illustrations
The much awaited expressions art exhibition will be held once again at Lionel Wendt Art gallery on July 1 and 2 10 am to 7 pm. It will be opened on June 30 at 6 pm. Showcased at this event will be around 100 paintings by immensely talented pupils who range from age 5 upwards to adult students, of celebrated artist Dulari de Fonseka.
The exhibition of acrylic on canvas demonstrates the creative and imaginative flair of each individual artist, most of who are Gold and Silver medalists, and the drawings themselves, a medium of communicating ones own story. It is a story that is backed by confidence in oneself, because art builds confidence. Dulari is of the firm belief that there is no proper singular method to create art, and that every artist, child or professional, feels an enduring sense of pride in their own creation; an original creation bursting with character, and made to last for generations.
Whilst being a proven method in developing essential motor skills in young children, it teaches one to be patient, be of calm mind, to concentrate, visualize and think clearly. It is therapy and it is meditation. It is utterly enjoyable, whilst communicating a serious message.
She credits her parents for identifying her inclination towards the fine arts from a young age and being the driving force behind her success as an artist. Understanding her passion for drawing, she had the opportunity of being sent to be tutored by Late Gate Mudaliyar Amarasekera, a celebrated and a distinguished artist of yesteryear. Even though he was in the twilight of his life, and Dulari herself was a small child, inspiration struck a deep chord, buoyed by the maestros instructions, guidance and blessings. Thereafter, she entered the reputed Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts to follow an extensive course in theoretical and practical aspects of fine arts to further her career, and has today made a name for herself in the country as a professional artist.
Experimenting with oil, watercolour, pastels, charcoal and pencils helps young people expose something beautiful and talented, and even after over two decades of doing what I love, the sense of satisfaction I experience in journeying with my students, is something incomparable.. says Dulari with a smile.
Dulari de Fonseka lives and paints with her family in Thalawatugoda. Her work can be found on www.dularipaintings.com.

Flat feet at root of  Sri Lanka injuries - expert
Colombo: Sri Lankas cricketers have been suffering from high levels of injuries because most players are flat footed and wearing ill-fitting shoes, an expert said Monday.
Australian podiatrist Nicholas Sprenger was contracted by Sri Lankan Cricket to get to the bottom of the squads injury problems, which last year saw nine out of 12 fast bowlers out of action.
After examining more than two dozen cricketers from the national side, Sprenger detected a running theme.
Most players are flat-footed. What we need to do is to get them to wear the right shoes, Sprenger told reporters in Colombo.
The squad has been kitted out with customised innersoles for players to use at training and on the global circuit.
Some team members will be wearing the special orthotics when they face Zimbabwe in the first one-day international at Galle on Friday.
The orthotics are designed to reduce stress on the bones, improve muscle activity and reduce pain, Sprenger said.
He flies out on Friday, but his expertise will be available to the national side for about two years to address injuries and get the squad back on track, Sri Lanka Cricket said.
Its chief executive officer Ashley de Silva declined to discuss the cost of fitting out the national squad with customised orthotics, but described it as an investment for the future.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera announced last week he would not allow any player who fails a fitness test to represent Sri Lanka.
Skipper Angelo Mathews and fast bowler Lasith Malinga have skipped crucial matches recently due to recurring injuries.
Sri Lanka will play five one-day international matches and one Test against Zimbabwe, in the countrys first tour of the island in 15 years. AFP

In-form Kuhn heads uncapped S.Africa trio for Test series
Johannesburg: Heino Kuhns two centuries on the South Africa A tour of England earned him a call-up on Monday to the senior squad for their upcoming four Test series with England.
The 33-year-old batsman -- who made centuries against Hampshire and then the England Lions -- is one of three uncapped players along with Aiden Markram and Andile Phehlukwayo to be named at Test level.
Heino Kuhn has shown outstanding form for South Africa A on their recent tour of England which included a double century in the four-day match against Hampshire and a further century against the England Lions, CSA selection convener Linda Zondi said.
He certainly deserved his place on consistent form.
Established stars like batsman AB de Villiers and paceman Dale Steyn are unavailable for selection. De Villiers is taking a break from Test cricket and Steyn hasnt fully recovered from a shoulder problem which has kept him off the pitch since the end of last year.
The team will be captained by Faf du Plessis and there is plenty of batting experience with Hashim Amla, JP Duminy and Quinton de Kock as well as on the bowling side with Morne Morkel and Vernon Philander.
Kuhn has some international experience having played Twenty20 cricket for his country.
Phehlukwayo, 21, has played not only T20 for The Proteas -- including the just concluded 2-1 series loss to England -- but also appeared in the one day series in England and the disappointing Champions Trophy campaign which saw the world ranked number one side fail to reach the semi-finals. AFP

She was speaking at the memorial ceremony organised in commemoration of late President Ranasinghe Premadasas 93rd birth anniversary in Piyagama on Friday (23).
The Minister said that they as the present government should be responsible to pay attention to investigate into such corruptions and take legal actions immediately. Athukorala also said that late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was unlike those politicians who utilize public funds to satisfy their own personal needs and wants. Instead, he had worked to uplift the living standards of the poor.
She further said, Late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was not an engineer or a doctor.
He was not even a degree holder. But he was a great leader to create over 800,000 employment opportunities with an average salary for them between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000.
After 25 years, today, that salary will be equivalent to at least of Rs. 100,000. He also implemented the 1,000,000 houses project and immensely contributed to declare 1979 as the Housing Year.

Hair-raising worries - answered
Hair has a personality of its own and not one that is easy to please. When your tresses behave well, you feel good. But a moody mane can give you tress stress. What's worse Hairloss. Hair's...er... here's all the help you need.
Q. When do I seek help
The popular notion is that if you shed around 100 hair strands a day, it is time to consult an expert. But there is no universal standard number. The rule: if you consistently, for a minimum period of two weeks, notice more hairloss than otherwise, take action. Sometimes, when you run a hand through your hair and strands detach easily, that too, is a red flag.
Q. Does oiling help
Yes. The traditional massage with coconut oil has been proven to have tremendous benefits on hair and scalp. Coconut oil has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that boost hair health. A good massage improves blood circulation in the scalp.
Q. Do hair spas work for hairloss
Not really. Hair spa will not reduce hairloss. It helps with frizziness and dryness, as deep conditioners, serums and hair packs help in that. Though it does reduce hair breakage that usually happens while combing and washing hair.
Q. Is there an anti-hairloss diet
Green foods provide biotin and red and orange foods have iron and antioxidants - all necessary for hair growth. For a hair-raising experience: eat eggs, fish and lean chicken, sprouts, soya, paneer and nuts such as almonds, walnuts, and omega-3 enriched flaxseeds. Multivitamins with B complex, vitamin C and iron can help combat hair loss, but it is best to see a dermatologist before quaffing them down.
Q. Does red light therapy work
Yes, it can stimulate hair growth. The most commonly used wavelengths for treating hairloss with red light therapy are in the range of 630-670 nanometers. The visible red light is capable of being absorbed by the molecules of the hair follicle leading to possible re-growth, following a natural biological reaction. Try this with a reputed trichologist. Diet tip: Control your sugar intake: it is a pro-inflammatory agent, which in excess may aggravate hairloss. Nutritional deficiencies and hormonal issues too can lead to a thinning crown. TNN

Holds no water
The movie series has had the makings of an epic adventure. Ever since Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, the first in the series took over the wide screen in 2003, the movies have been much sought after by moviegoers.
The last film in the series swings between two talented actors: Johnny Depp and Javier Bardem. Orlando Bloom too gets noticed in a cameo. The rest of the cast do their bit but are unable to keep the movie afloat.
The VFX is stunning and the actors comic timing is impeccable. Cinematographer Paul Camerons shots of cramped Caribbean towns and the vast nothingness of sea are impressive. The pace of the film keeps you hooked. The movie also thrives on star-power, cameos and special effects. Directors Joachim Rnning and Espen Sandberg also work up a stormy sea-parting finale.
Troubled waters
However two elements get the movie in troubled waters. The film lacks surprises. You can simply guess what is about to happen and some of the actions seem unbelievable as well. Not only does it this make a boring watch but it is also like a stab in the heart for those who wished to see a fitting farewell to Jack Sparrow.
The other drawback is that Jack Sparrow, the character who led all the action in the previous movies, seems out of place in this storyline. It is truly heartbreaking to see a franchise coming to an end by deeming its protagonist and requiring so little of him in this manner.
Sense of nostalgia
Though Sparrow continues to be a charming, drunken pirate who waddles into a quest for the ultimate treasure in Dead Men Tell No Tales, he lacks the punch. The bulk of the film focuses on Henrys quest to find Poseidons Trident and free his father, Will Turner, from a curse. He runs into Carina who is also after the Trident as a means to connect with her own estranged father. However the young adventurers need a ship and a captain to take them to the treasure. This is when Sparrow steps in and this seems to be his sole purpose. Meantime Sparrow is also on the run from Salazar, a half-dead-half-alive ghost-man thirsty for revenge.
Despite the odds one still does get a little thrill in watching Johnny Depp play the legendary Jack Sparrow. Though the movies which entered the series later were not quite up to the mark, Pirates of the Caribbean fans cannot help but feel a sense of nostalgia in hoping to see more of Depp dressed as Sparrow in the future.

Insightful glimpse into the LGBTIQ communities
Improper, distorted and passive interpretation of sex could result in the deprivation of healthy sexual lives among people and increase frustration amongst them. That may eventually pave way for a poor turnover and reduced GDP of a country.
Sex of diverse sorts is treated as a taboo subject in some countries around the globe due to religious, political and socio-cultural factors. Can someone argue that sex too is a relative-factor by taking in Albert Einsteins discoveries
Human Rights and Fundamental Rights came into force revitalized in recent times. This drew the attention of scholars, political leaders, opinion-leaders and lobby groups towards the rights of the masses to observe things (inclusive of sex) according to their conscience.
This could boil down even to the subjects of gender equality as well as homo-sexuality, bi-sexuality or lesbianism.
Sex is treated by some societies as a thing that is needed only for reproductive purposes ignoring the fact that it is the decisive obsession that provides pleasures of the skin for mortals in this Blue Planet aka Magul Sakwala.
LGBTIQ communities in some counties are compelled to constantly play hide and seek due to the fear of being exposed and loss of face. Plenty of unmarried women and men in a country like ours who are gay or lesbians cannot reveal their true identities. They suffer day-by-day mentally and no one knows who is committing the sin here.
The impact of little actions during a persons childhood must be seen into in later years by people who discriminate queer people before they indulge in such actions.
As the editor of the Equality magazine Rosanna Flamer-Caldera says; Criminalization of sexual orientation/gender identity merely creates problems and solves none.
A particular society looking down upon individuals who have their own interpretation of sex as shameful and abnormal is a subject that has to be discussed at length with a cross-section of politicians, scholars, opinion-leaders, teachers, citizens, lobby groups and the clergy.
Equal Ground is an entity that works hard towards fulfilling the needs of the community each year giving the LGBTIQ community the space to stand up tall and be proud of who and what they are.
Being the only organization in Sri Lanka to hold annual Pride celebrations, an important event in the Sri Lanka LGBTIQ calendar, Equal Ground is positioned with the vision; Equality for all sexual orientations and gender identities; human rights for everyone.
Colombo Pride festival unveiled by EQUAL GROUND in 2005 is one of the oldest Pride Festivals in South Asia.
Colombo Pride Festival makes way for the LGBTIQ community to showcase their talents. Events include workshops, dramas, musicals, art and photo exhibitions, parties, kite festival and the Abhimani International Film Festival.
An integral part of Colombo Pride has always been the LGBTIQ film festival formally known as Celluloid Rainbows and now branded as Abhimani.
Abhimani is the only international LGBTIQ film festival in Sri Lanka and the oldest of the kind in South Asia. It is held each year in conjunction with Colombo Pride presenting a collection of Queer short and feature length films from countries around the globe.
The 2017 Abhimani film festival was held from June 19 to 22 at the Goethe-Institut in Colombo.
A collection of absorbing and insightful short and feature length films from India, Pakistan, Hong Kong, Philipines, Australia, South Korea, USA, Romania, Germany and Sri Lanka was screened at the fest free of charge.

Live the story!
Aditha Dissanayake has been in the limelight recently as the winner of the H.A.I Goonetileke Prize at the Gratiaen Trust Awards, 2017 for her translation of Batuwangala Rahula Theras Rankaraduwa to English as The Golden Casket. Translating however, is only one of her talents  a regular contributor to the Daily News she is a journalist, novelist and childrens writer.
Her journey from obtaining a first class in English (hons) from the University of Kelaniya and as a lecturer of English also at the same university to the post of Features Editor of the Sunday Observer and a stint at the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute, New York University, USA, is an intriguing story in itself.
Q: How did youstart writing
When I was small I was a voracious reader. There were always plenty of books lying around at home, but I would go through them in next to no time and walk around saying I have nothing to read. My father, Daya Dissanayake, who is also a writer, would say If you dont have anything to read, write something. I didnt listen to him at first, but then, because I so wanted to read something new I started to write my own stories  and read them when I had no other books to read. I never grew out of that habit.
Q: And then you became a famousshort-story writer
Every Sunday, for about ten minutes  thats the time it takes for my readers to go through one of my short stories  I became a short story writer. Im not sure about the adjective though. I was at university when my first short stories and articles were published in the Sunday papers and I felt I had begun my journey. I was on my way to become a writer. I was lucky because unlike most parents who want their children to grow up to be doctors, engineers or lawyers when I told mine that I want to be a writer my parents said, go ahead. And I thought I was going to become a famous novelist. Instead, now Im known as a translator.
Q: How did that happen How did you end up from being a journalist to creative writer to translator
Remember what Alan Saunders said about life Life is what happens to us while we are making other plans. That definition fits me almost perfectly. When I was at the University of Kelaniya I decided to major in English and planned to take archeology as my subsidiary subject. But there was a rule saying those who didnt study archeology in their first year could not take it as their sub in the second year. So, I stumbled upon the rather new, rather unknown subject called translation methods. Back then no one hardly knew about it. And back then I didnt dream I would end up becoming a translator.
Q: What makes a good translator
You will have to ask a good translator this question. I dont see myself as a good translator. I strive to be good. I strive to reach perfection and I leave my readers to judge if I am good or not.
Q: What techniques do youuse when translating a story
None. I simply connect with one or two major characters in the story. In Rankaraduwa it was with the protagonist  the monk that I connected so totally. I lived his story, with him, in English.
Q: Translation is one of theimportant fields in buildingcultures. So do you think it is theresponsibility of the translator to reconstruct the source language text in the target culture in a way which complies with the cultural beliefs of the target language
Not necessarily. It is not the translators responsibility to reconstruct the text to fit the cultural beliefs of the target language. The translator has no right to change or modify a text. If this happens it can never be called a translation. Then it becomes an adaptation.
Q: Theres a dearth of goodtranslators in Sri Lanka. Readersusually get bored in the middle ofreading translations due to theirsheer complexity and ambiguity.How clever should a translator be to produce a translation which is as interesting as the original
The translator should have a thorough knowledge of the source language and all the nuances that come with the source language and then have a thorough knowledge of the target language, too. Most critics think something is always lost in translation. But I believe something can be gained in translation too.
The best example of this that I have come across is Sugathapala de Silvas Ata Massa. In my eyes the translation is better than the original text - The Glad Fly.
Q: Tell us about your own work.
I have written two collections of short stories for young adults, one childrens book, and one novel  Somewhere on the Green Hills. My second novel, When a Cloud Left the Sky will be out this September.
Q: What is the hardest thing about being a writer
Well...quite a lot of things: the panic that you have run out of ideas for stories; the struggle to make each new story better than the one before; the fear of not knowing if what I created is any good at all.
Q: The best thing
When someone takes the time to find my email address or search for me on social media and sends me a note saying how much they like my work. Or meeting my readers in person; the warmth of a handshake, that instant connection - they know me through my books and my articles.

Maha Sangha showing the way
The picture on the front page of several newspapers yesterday showing a group of Buddhist monks walking in single file to the premises of the Jaffna Hospital to donate blood is indeed a refreshing sight from the many pictures carried in the same newspapers in recent times depicting members of the Sangha participating in violent demonstrations and being manhandled by the police. According to the report accompanying the picture, a group of 100 Bikkhus donated blood at the Jaffna Hospital in response to an SOS for urgent need of blood due to depleted stocks at the hospital. The Maha Sangha who donated blood was led by Pepiliyana Sunethra Devi Pirivenadhipathy and Sri Jayawardenapura University Professor the Ven. Medagoda Abhayatissa. It was only last week that a group of soldiers donated blood to the Jaffna Hospital. This was perhaps the first time that members of the Sangha, as a body, had donated blood to the Jaffna Hospital, or anywhere, for that matter. Hence it should be taken as a sign of willingness on the part of the majority community to integrate with their brethren in the north, dismantling all barriers that had hitherto stood in the way of both sides, with the Maha Sangha, who carries the voice of the majority community, showing the way.
Both, members of the Sangha and those of the security forces have long been seen as being hostile towards the minority communities. There has been some justification in this respect given the recent utterances of certain militant monks and also the conduct and antics of certain members of the Bikkhu community. But, by and large, our Maha Sangha in general have time and again shown by their deeds that they bore no ill will towards the Tamil community. The blood donated by the members of the Sangha at the Jaffna Hospital, no doubt, will be transfused to the Tamil patients in the north. This, while being an act of merit, is a sign of the brotherhood displayed by the majority community towards their Tamil brethren as exemplified by the act of the Bikkhus, giving meaning to the core teaching of the Buddha that hatred ceaseth not by hatred but by love and compassion. It is important that this noble gesture on the part of the members of the Maha Sangha and the security forces be made a catalyst to cement bonds with a once estranged community, moving further closer to the goal of reconciliation.
More and more missions of this nature should be promoted by the authorities to bring the two communities closer. The media too can play an important role in this exercise. Unfortunately certain media today tend to bring out the differences between the two communities, more, than working towards uniting the two sides. Certain events in the north are reported out of context to give it a communal twist that could exacerbate ingrained prejudices. Sometimes, violent incidents in the north are being portrayed as signs of a revival of the LTTE while similar or identical incidents take place in the south which are all part of the criminal world. Such portrayal of incidents invariable influence the minds of the majority community to view all Tamils with hostility which is a step back on the road to reconciliation. Hence it is the bounden duty of the media to act with responsibility whereby it should strive to bring out the positives rather than the negatives aspects of communal relations.
Now that the members of the Maha Sangha and the Military, no less, have shown the way, it is hoped that the rancour and bitterness engendered by long years of estrangement would be banished once and for all and the two communities join together in peaceful co-existence as sons and daughters of one nation.
Be that as it may, Tamil politicians too should make their contribution towards fostering good relations between the two communities. Like the Bikkhus have done, they too should undertake missions to the south that will send a message to the majority community that they are serious in working towards reconciliation. They have a good opportunity for doing this now, with a senior and respected Tamil politician functioning as the Leader of the Opposition. The recent act by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and a group of Tamil politicians from the north, distributing flood relief in Ratnapura was viewed positively by many. More and more gestures of this nature from Sampathan and his colleagues would help alley suspicion by the majority Sinhalese. As Leader of the Opposition he now has the scope and opportunity to work for the nation at large rather than confining himself to represent his people in the north alone. Regrettably, some of the politicians in the north continue to make statements that echo the past which certainly make things difficult for moderate politicians like Sampanthan. They are not only antagonising the majority community by their utterances but also negate the gestures of the like made by the group of Bikkhus who donated blood at the Jaffna Hospital.

Make-up mistakes we often make
Most of us barely have time to spend even 10 minutes on our make-up every morning. Hence, it is important that we utilise those precious minutes like a pro and fix those make-up mistakes without making too much of a mess. Here's what you can do...
* More often than not, we end up with clumps of mascara on our eyelashes, which can be a pain to remove. Instead of trying to immediately remove it, wait a minute or two till it is dry and then peel off. This will prevent smudging.
* Not all of us are blessed with thick, dark eyebrows and have to use eyebrow pencils/ mascaras to make them darker. But we often end up over-pencilling. Correct this by using a small eyebrow brush to comb your brows and apply the tiniest bit of concealer on the browbone and just above your brows.
* We've all been guilty of applying too much of blush. Fix this by using a small sponge to gently remove the excess colour from the apples of your cheeks. Remember not to dab too hard or you might end up smudging the blush, making it appear even darker than before.
* Getting your eyeliner smudged on your eyelid is a mistake most women have made. Instead of fretting, simply take apply some concealer on your eyelid and top it up with some a neutral-toned eyeshadow.
* Patchy eyeshadow is another common problem. Apply some concealer on a brush and gently blend it with your eyeshadow to get an even tone.
* All set to party and realise your face looks like the glitter fairy exploded on it Instead of using a damp tissue, use scotch tape on a earbud to remove excess glitter. Times of India

Minions hog : the limelight in Despicable Me 3
Minions might struggle to carry an entire movie (as their self-titled 2015 spin-off confirmed), but the googly-eyed little guys steal every one of their scenes in this workman-like three-quel.
And their finger-clicking, black-and-white stripes prison routine is a show-stopper. The anarchic energy of the cute yellow critters is particularly important now that the formerly despicable Gru (Steve Carell) and his fearless new wife Lucy (Kristen Wiig) have settled into cosy domesticity with their three girls  Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier) and Agnes (Nev Scharrel).
In Despicable Me 3, the filmmakers introduce a long-lost twin brother to further enliven the franchise. Drus candy-coloured Freedonian mansion provides a welcome change of scenery for Gru after he is fired by the ferocious new head of the Anti-Villain League (AVL) for letting Despicable Me 3s new villain, Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), escape.
Despicable Me 3 is will begin screening at Liberty By Scope Cinemas 3D, Savoy Premier 3D, Don Plaza  Kalutara, Excel Cinema 3D, Sky Lite 3D Malabe, Sky Lite 3D Matara and MC- Gold 3D from June 23.

## Title: Moving towards an ethical media culture
## Supertitle:

## Date: Tuesday, June 27, 2017 - 01:00
Moving towards an ethical media culture
President Maithripala Sirisena recently reiterated the importance of an ethical media culture in Sri Lanka and added that the State media should take the lead.
It is this Governments credit that all media in Sri Lanka operate today in a peaceful environment, free of state control. They are able to sustain a pluralist media culture without obstacles. In our unique media market, it is often contended that the proliferation of publications, radio stations, television channels, and internet websites is a sure-fire guarantor for plurality, diversity, and media freedom.
Despite these impressive numbers for a small country, for a long period, the mass media in Sri Lanka were dominated by a small group, which exercised considerable influence on what was read, heard, and watched.
Sri Lankas established private media conglomerates have staunchly refused to accept the need for some restrictions over ownership and control, arguing that this would eventually result in devious and dubious forms of censorship. The government too had played along. After all, powerful politicians needed media barons as much as they need them  a mutually beneficial arrangement.
However, the reality is that a group of political and economic elites still exercise a pervasive influence on media and journalism.Many people, not only those in authority but even ordinary people, have started saying that the media have become irresponsible and wayward, and need to be reined in.
Defects
There are a number of obvious defects in our media. One is that the media often twist facts. We have seen in innumerable occasions how news was manipulated. It could have been the Government or the owners. We saw how truth conflicted with other social values. We also saw how the sensitive government or military information were revealed by some media during times of disturbances.
Our media often forget about privacy. Salacious details of the lives of public figures is a central content element in many media. Publication is not necessarily justified simply because the information is true. Privacy is also a right, and one which conflicts with free speech.
Fantasy is an element of entertainment, which is a legitimate goal of media content. Our journalism sometimes mixed fantasy and truth, with resulting ethical dilemmas. Photo journalists who cover war and disasters confront situations which may shock the sensitivities of their audiences. For example, human remains are rarely screened. The ethical issue is how far should one risk shocking an audiences sensitivities in order to correctly and fully report the truth.
Another identifiable defect is that our media often portray non-issues as real issues, while the real issues are side-lined.
Freedom
The freedom of the media is guaranteed by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka which gives every citizen the freedom of speech and expression including publication. However, no freedom can be absolute, and reasonable restrictions can be placed on it.
The audiences of media, whether readers, listeners or viewers, expect the media is to provide them truthful and objective information that will enable them to form rational opinions, which is a sine qua non in a democracy. But are the Sri Lankan media performing this role properly
Dark days
Most of us remember the days when our media were technically under complete state control. Those were the days when the conditions for independent journalism were compromised by a toxic political environment, combined with suppressed civil society institutions which rendered media vulnerable to corrupt relations with different centres of power.
Media were used as foot-soldiers for the war mongering of ethno-national political elites during the LTTE war period. They contributed to the polarisation of communities, the demonization of other ethnic groups and finally to the justification of violence against the other. To this day, there is no common moral condemnation of inadmissible media practices prior and during the conflict.Even today, the problems of hate-speech and lack of commitment to ethical standards of accuracy, impartiality and transparency in journalism remain in place.
Self-regulation
Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka believes self-regulation works and, therefore, the best solution to overcome these issues. Not surprisingly, independent self-regulation of media is a challenge across all platforms of journalism. Much of the responsibility is borne by Sri Lanka Press Institute, Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka, The Dispute Resolution Council, The Editors Guild, all of which have been created by and are maintained thanks to support from the public funds.
Although all groups say there is a better general awareness and knowledge about the role and work of these bodies, when it comes to respect for codes of conduct, issues of defamation, privacy and journalistic reporting, serious problems still remain.
This writer also feels that some of the stories published and broadcasted by our media are overplayed  more are made of them than seemed really justified. Credibility is a very essential necessity to media enterprises. It is for their own survival that they need to safeguard it.
Ethical practice
Given this scenario, it is obvious that there is a need to strengthen ethical practice among the media personnel, and particularly within the print and TV media where the scourge of sensationalism and unethical practice dominates.
With this in mind, this writer would like to suggest that we initiate an Ethical Journalism Council, an independent body which can prepare guidelines and proposals for helping media to improve the way they work. Such guidelines would help media develop a self-reporting system to ensure they have good governance in their management as well as respect for ethics, self-regulation and transparency in their editorial work.
An Ethical Journalism Council can strengthen the craft of journalism and promote for the public benefit high ethical standards, based on principles of truth and accuracy, impartiality and accountability by the provision of education and training.
Social media
It is estimated there are over 100 online news web portals in Sri Lanka of which, perhaps only 10 per cent are open about their ownership.
A lack of transparency both in ownership and political links with most portals tied in with some branch of the political community. A widespread tendency exists towards fake stories. Editorial material is not fact-checked and is often just cut and pasted from, non-attributed sources.
There is an urgent need for the drafting of social media guidelines to encourage online media enterprises to adopt a self-reporting system to improve their internal standards of governance and editorial performance.
Such initiative could help people in Sri Lanka understand that there are two kinds of journalism. One track is that of unregulated and unethical online reporting and the other is the work of trusted brands based on ethics and standards.
New initiatives
The free media landscape in Sri Lanka is still not up to mark. It suffers from weak economic conditions, undue pressure from the political ownership and a lack of commitment within media circles to core values of journalism and ethical standards.
There is a need for new initiatives to develop more transparency and commitment to professionalism on all platforms of journalism and particularly to highlight the distinctive nature of trusted channels which show attachment to ethics, good governance and self-regulation.
The absence of internal systems for monitoring and auditing editorial performance and governance at the level of the media enterprise is noted across the whole of the Sri Lankan media landscape. The Press Council should be invited to support programmes aimed at strengthening internal standards of good governance and ethics at enterprise level.
The ethical audits and the adoption of new guidelines by media enterprises should be further developed and implemented. The use of the mechanisms for self-regulation and good governance at enterprise level and at industry level can help to identify media on all platforms that follow core standards of journalism and accountability to the public at large.
Where such media are identified there should be consideration of how to provide additional funding and resources to strengthen newsroom capacity without compromising editorial independence.

Walking the dog is a normal scene anywhere in the world. But when was the last time you saw a bird being taken for a stroll And dont dismiss my story by asking me to go tell it to the birds, because its true.
While you probably take your pet walking at least to relieve itself, you may have overlooked how valuable exercise can also be to your pets health. There are places where certain unusual pets taken for a constitutional are not the furry canines but those of the feathered kind.
In Hong Kong for instance, its not only the dogs that get aired and walked. Its the birds! When I was new to the territory the sight of men walking their birds was so astonishing that you could have knocked me down with a feather when I first observed the phenomenon.
The owners themselves are queer birds of a feather, because they are all die-hard enthusiasts with one interest in common. Yet I may rightly describe myself as a bird of passage bearing in mind my many work experiences abroad as a scribbler in diverse capitals of the world. Yes, I concede I have been a sort of journeyman journalist in various parts of the Asian region, which makes me a migratory bird.
You see, the good thing about my wandering work experience had helped me adjust and adapt admirably to many unfamiliar customs and environments, where certain other expatriates have suffered anxiety that has led to culture shock. Personally speaking, I have found the situations adventuresome, funny and intriguing.
In Hong Kong and China, men are famous for walking their pet birds in the early morning. Men, both young and old - but mostly old - walk while gently swinging the birdcages, all covered with black or white cloth. Early in the morning on sunny days youll see them, flocks of geriatric men shuffling towards local parks and green spaces.
Sorry to disappoint you girls, but the avian aficionados and their charges are all of the masculine gender. Like their owners, all of the birds are male. Thats because they are the only ones who sing. In the wild, their voice helps them display bravado against their rivals as they hopefully serenade to win the heart of a prized mate.
Most of the birdmen are over 60 years of age carrying one or more cloth covered cages. A particularly large group converge like a secret club. With ritualistic intensity, each member carefully scans the tree branches, looking for a prime spot to hang their cage. Once hung, the man will uncover his ward and song immediately bursts forth. By 9 am, hundreds of bamboo cages clutter the trees, their trilling din reaching a cacophonous crescendo.
They may be pampered pets in beautifully gilded metal or ornate bamboo cages but the fact remains that they are jailbirds nonetheless. The hackneyed phrase As free as a bird is not their lot, although they are cosseted with kindness and spoiled rotten. To earn their keep all they have to do is sing for their supper while their owners listen to their full-throated recital in mesmerised absorption. In birdmens lore to own a rara-avis is a badge of honour among the fraternity.
That is why these cage-swinging oldsters with their prized charges come into the birding rendezvous with a spring in their step and a hint of a swagger. Talk about fiercely proud bird owners being transformed from debilitated dodderers to animated cock-a-hoop showmen. Its hard to imagine how a tiny feathered creature could turn a senile shuffler into an assertive strutting cock-of-the walk human.
Most of the birds youll see during these gatherings are Chinese thrush, or Huamei which means blackened or painted eyebrows. They cant be taught to speak, but their singing voice is considered the sweetest. A popular haunt for songbird supporters, the visually engaging Yuen Po Street Bird Garden is designed in the style of a traditional Chinese garden. The park has dozens of stalls selling exotic birds, beautifully crafted bamboo cages, porcelain water dishes and other bird-care paraphernalia.
While its unlikely that youll be purchasing a few Chinese thrushes or skylarks as mementos of your Hong Kong trip, the garden is a pleasant place to witness this age-old Chinese hobby in action, where birdmen feed and preen their feathered friends in exchange for sweet songs.
Their birds hop and chirp inside their decorative cages, some playing beak-a-boo with their jailbird neighbours. However there is a unique pecking order in the choice of avian varieties among these enthusiasts. While their counterparts in the rest of the world would plump for attractive plumage the Chinese bird buffs are not usually enamoured by typical ornamental varieties.
They rather have their eyes peeled and ears tuned on songbirds which are the more highly prized for their vocal ability. Whether a songbird is good or not is decided by their song quality, not feather colour. Basically its the songbirds which actually rule the roost even though they might not be much to ogle at.
Further on, past the Flower Market, bird fanciers use chopsticks to feed live crickets to pets at the Bird Garden. Lovebirds and nightingales are among the many caged birds - some are for sale, others are along for a companionable squawk.
A newspaper I worked for in the then British territory carried some unusual footage of an elderly man walking down the street  with his pet bird. The man, who uses what looks like a folded-up chair for support, shuffles down the street with the little bird following closely behind. His feathered friend even stops with his owner at a crossing to wait for the pedestrian green light.
The peculiarity of the scene is not lost on other pedestrians, who watch in amazement as the elderly gentleman and his small companion amble along. At one point a woman even stops the man to take a picture. We even received a good many comments about the phenomenon such as: What kind of a dog is that and Must be his wing man! And another witty one-liner: The guys a chick magnet!
And Im not squawking about that Brit slang term Bird for a cute member of the human feminine species. Meaning the type of bird you link arms with while taking a lovey-dovey moonlight walk. No, and its not the type of bird-watching that involves the use of binoculars or telescopes for prurient or non-ornithological purposes.
That, as you must be well aware, is a pastime which typically consists of men who take an inordinate delight in surreptitiously ogling women who are busy getting undressed, taking a shower or indulging in a bit of private hanky-panky.

National cricketers fail SLC fitness test
A physical fitness test conducted by Sri Lanka Crickets physical fitness specialists have found that none of the national team cricketers are on par with the international physical fitness levels.
SLC conducted this physical fitness aptitude test for national team cricketers at the R. Premadasa International Stadium last week and submitted a comprehensive report to top SLC officials and to Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
The report recommended that all cricketers selected for the forthcoming Zimbabwe series must take immediate action to improve their physical fitness levels. The role of SLC and Sports Ministry in overcoming this problem will be decisive.
The aptitude test included a distance run (20 meters) and the Yo-Yo test, which is an endurance test. Only Dushmantha Chameera and Lahiru Kumara got through the Yo-Yo test. Lasith Malinga and Seekkuge Prasanna had not participated in the Yo-Yo test.
The international standard time for the 20-metre run is 2.8 seconds and none of the cricketers were able to reach that mark. The players who came close to the mark were Nuwan Kulasekara (2.89 secs) and Lasith Malinga (2.91 secs).
Milinda Siriwardana was clocked at 2.92 secs, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal at 2.93 secs, Lahiru Kumara 2.95 secs and Angelo Mathews and Seekkuge Prasanna at 2.97 secs.
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara recently made comments on the national cricketers fitness levels and said that even though we had talented players, their fitness levels were very poor at the moment and that immediate steps should be taken to improve their fitness levels. He also recommended them for military training saying that many countries follow that practice.
Everyone should undergo a fitness test and only those who reach the required standards will have my approval to represent the national team, the Minister said.

Pride and Prejudice home goes on the market
More than twenty years ago, Pride and Prejudice dominated our TV screens - introducing the nation to Georgian dresses, rural homes and, of course, a dripping wet Colin Firth.

Situated 17 miles from Bath, Luckington Court has been put on the market for the first time in 70 years by agents Woolley & Wallis.

The Grade-II listed house, built of Cotswold stone, contains original Tudor features but has been sympathetically modernised and tastefully decorated. Located on the site of a manor owned by King Harold before 1066, the present house was remodelled during the 16 Century and has been in the current owners family since 1947.
As a country estate this property ticks all the boxes, set in one of the most delightfulCotswold villages with easy access to the M4, Bath, Bristol and only 75 minutes to London Paddington.
The house consists of a range of elegant well-proportioned rooms, eight bedrooms with seven bathrooms plus an integral flat and a separate self-contained annexe accommodation. In addition there are five dwellings and a 17 Century square dovecote. Overlooking the Rose Garden is a Grade II listed stable block containing seven loose boxes, tack room, cart shed and walled outdoor mange.
The Home Farm is accessed by a separate gated road and includes a range of modern and traditional buildings with land comprising 145 acres (58 hectares) of permanent grassland, just over 6 acres (25 hectares) of woodland and 780 metres of River Avon frontage.
Woolley & Wallis partner, Richard Nocton, said: Rarely does a property of this quality and in a such a sought after location come up for sale.
Its excellent condition, additional accommodation and manageable farm will provide the buyer with not only a desirable estate but a country lifestyle in a rural community close to the amenities of Cirencester, Bath, Bristol.

Puttalam landfill ready by 2019
Garbage problemover in two years
Central Waste ManagementAuthority for whole country 
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka said work on the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill in Puttalam will begin in September and it will be fully operational by early 2019.
The government will also establish a Central Waste Management Authority, responsible for the waste management of the whole country, the Minister said. He said the Government is confident of completing a comprehensive programme to solve the solid waste disposal issue within a two year period if there are no more obstructions by elements with vested interests.
Some politicians try to play the hero by using the waste management issue as a means to an end. But,this issue is far too serious to be meddled with, Minister Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranawaka was briefing the media at Suhurupaya, Battaramulla yesterday regarding the mega plan to develop the worked-out limestone quarries in Aruwakkalu, Puttalam into a Sanitary Landfill for disposal of solid waste.
The project will be carried out by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry, he said.
Minister Ranawaka said Cabinet approval was granted to initiate the project.
The projects engineering planning is now in order and we have already submitted the feasibility study for the project. We are now awaiting the results of the Environmental Assessment Report, he further said.
Minister Ranawaka also said the plan is to transfer waste using rail transport from Colombo to the proposed sanitary landfill.
We will only have to build 400-500 metres of railway for this proposed transportation method. The rest of the railway lines already exist, he said.
The World Bank has agreed to fund the Aruwakkalu Sanitary Land Fill, after the Sri Lankan government sought international assistance for the proposed project.
This is the first time where the World Bank is agreeing to fund a project carried out by Sri Lankan engineers to our own plan. They usually bring a team of their own when they fund our projects, Minister Ranawaka said.
The government is to call for tenders by mid July for the project, from both local and foreign investors in the construction industry, Minister Ranawaka also said.
The Tender procedure will be subjected to the scrutiny of a special team sent by the World Bank, he added.
There are three main issues hindering proper waste management in the country, Minister Ranawaka pointed out. The most serious of them all is the legal limitations, he said.
Minister Ranawaka noted the two other limitations are the high cost to be paid for waste management projects and the lack of proper projects initiated by previous governments.
No one has come to an agreement as to who can execute the waste management responsibilities to their fullest. The Provincial Councils, Municipal Councils have no agreement regarding this issue. That is why the President and the Prime Minister of this country are forced to physically appear at dumping sites and inspect these matters, Minister Ranawaka further pointed out.
Minister Ranawaka also recalled that former Chief Justice Sarath N.Silva issued a court order against the limitations imposed by the government on the use of plastics and polythene.
Sarath N. Silva said the people have a right to use plastics and polythene as they wish. See what it has brought us now. He was the same person who proposed to dump waste in Meetotamulla, Ranawaka pointed out.
The Minister also said that it is not the responsibility of the Ministry of Megapolis to manage waste in the country, even though many seem to believe so.
It is saddening to note that not one ton of waste was correctly managed from the year 2007, Minister Ranawaka added.
Ranawaka said that the funds allocated for a three km highway project will be spent for one waste management project. Therefore, if we are developing highways, there is no reason why we cannot establish waste management projects, despite how costly they may seem, he pointed out.
He said each Sri Lankan creates a kilogram of waste per day, and it is but fair that they are expected to pay for the management of the waste they create.
Minister Ranawaka emphasised that this project will hopefully see the dawn of day without falling prey to political opportunism.
We plead from all parties to support this project without creating more tragedies like Meetotamulla. We can remember how people were misled to say no to the Dompe land fill. If someone hinders this project, the Ministry of Megapolis will step down from steering this project.
The ones who hamper this project will have to take the responsibility for the garbage crisis we are currently in, Minister Ranawaka pointed out.
He also said Sri Lanka lost a golden opportunity of receiving a World Bank funded waste management project in 1996, which was initiated by the present Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya.
We cannot afford to lose this opportunity we have got now, Minister Ranawaka pointed out.
I heard former President Mahinda Rajapaksa saying that he also initiated a waste management project. His so called waste management project is what ended up as the Meetotamulla dump, Minister Ranawaka added.

Pyjama power!
A slumber party took over Park Street Mews on June 18 when sleepwear label Mackly hosted its first runway sleepwear show. The Mackly models enjoyed every minute of their turn on the runway, marking a first for Sri Lanka as ladies and kids modelled the labels Kids Sleepwear range and premiered the Ladies Pyjama line.
Mackly Founder Sharmila Srikumar launched the label in 2014, with exclusive focus on childrens sleepwear. She was inspired by her own long quests in search of comfortable, safe, adaptable and cute sleepwear for her children. The Mackly label initially designed childrens sleepwear, and with this show Sharmila debuted her first Ladies Pyjama Line for older customers.
At the show, Sri Lankas first exclusive sleepwear showcase, 35 young children bounded down the runway in their Mackly pyjamas. The company places emphasis on the safety factor-each piece goes through a needle and metal detector and is phthalate and allergy-free. Comfort is an additional factor-the sleepwear is made with 100 percent breathable cotton material and all t-shirts have heat seals in place of labels to avoid discomfort at the back of the neck. Moreover, each piece is tested for colour fastness and shrinkage.
Macklys ladieswear collection was launched at the show with an opening performance by 12 year old Senruni Abeywickrema, who sang Rihannas hit single Diamonds. The show, complete with a dance performance by the models and dancers, was well received. The ladieswear collection brings functional style to the table, and Sharmila says she was responding to overwhelming demand from her young customers mothers, older siblings and other friends. In this day and age theres no such thing as ratty old pyjamas, she shared at the event. In this highly visible, selfie-policed culture even your pyjamas need to be on-trend. And who doesnt want to be in their comfiest clothes after a busy day
The walk sequences were choreographed by well-known modern, jazz and ballet trainer Surekha Buell. Sharmila thanked her friends, the parents of her young models, and others who contributed to the shows success including Head Masters who managed Hair and Makeup for the models. She thanked her young brand representatives in particular, saying We are so proud of all the kids who have amazed us on stage today. She also added, Think about how often you wear these clothes. Its worth having something nice to go to bed in at the end of a day. Cozy clothes are more relevant now, and weve made them stylish and added extra comfort and safety features for a great night of sleep. Mackly sleepwear is available at Odel and Cotton Collection with a new collection out every three months. The latest collections are expected to hit the shelves from July.

Rahane, Kohli shine as India rout Windies
Port of Spain: Ajinkya Rahanes third hundred and a blistering assault by captain Virat Kohli took India to a comfortable 105-run victory over the West Indies in the second one-day international at the Queens Park Oval on Sunday.
Replying to the visitors formidable total of 310 for five in a match reduced to 43 overs per side due to early morning rain and an two-hour delayed start, the hosts were restricted to 205 for six in reply despite a fluent 81 by Shai Hope at the top of the order.
Following the rain-ruined no result at the start of the series at the same venue two days earlier, India now take a 1-0 lead into the next two matches in Antigua next Friday and Sunday.
Rahanes well-paced 103 in another dominant opening partnership with Shikhar Dhawan (63) set the tone for the tourists after they were put in to bat in heavily overcast and damp conditions.
Having missed out on the Champions Trophy I was really hungry to perform here, said man-of-the-match Rahane.
I really enjoy batting with Shikhar because he makes it so much easier for anyone batting with him.
Kohli then picked up the pace even further when Dhawan departed after a first-wicket partnership of 114, the left-hander being deceived by Ashley Nurse to be stumped.
Rahane eventually reached three figures with a boundary off Miguel Cummins. However Nurse got his revenge in the same over when the batsmen attempted an ungainly heave and was bowled for 103.
Rahanes innings occupied 104 deliveries and was embellished by two sixes and ten fours.
Having dominated a 97-run second-wicket partnership with Rahane, Kohli made centre stage all his own in the final assault.
He seemed destined to reach another ODI hundred to the delight of a decent contingent of visiting Indian fans when he was caught at long-off by Nurse off Alzarri Joseph for 87 off 66 balls in the penultimate over.
Missing out on a hundred means nothing to me. It was more important to be getting runs for the team at the end of the innings, Kohli said.
Windies captain Jason Holder conceded 20 runs, bowled three no balls and had to be pulled out of the attack with one ball left because two of those no balls were delivered over waist-high to the batsman on strike.
It was left to Jonathan Carter to complete the over and the innings, encapsulating a shoddy effort overall by the home side.
Promoted to open the batting, Hope was the lone bright light in the West Indies response, his attacking innings off 88 balls with three sixes and five hours keeping slim hopes alive until he fell leg-before to Kuldeep Yadav. AFP

Rasa to tantalize your senses
It was the great Freddie Mercury who sang the lyrics of Radio Ga Ga
I'd sit alone and watch your
light
My only friend through teenage
nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio..
You gave them all those old time stars,
Through wars of worlds - invaded
by mars
You made 'em laugh - you made
'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly.
Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around 'cause we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio.
Indeed in Sri Lanka these lyrics are true. Radio, in this island is still one of the most popular sources of information and entertainment. Daily News recently attended the Launch of Rasa the newest Radio Channel in Sri Lanka.
This radio channel promises to be a Sinhala Radio Channel with a difference. Rasa can be tuned into on 99.5FM and 99.7FM. On June 30, Rasa will be broadcasted. Rasa will be added to Sky Media Networks FM channels, bringing the total up to three  Rasa FM, Sith FM and Red FM (English Radio Channel). In addition to this I must also say that we have a news channel also called NEWS 24. The other channels Sith and Red FM I must say have become immensely successful in a short period of time and for this we at Sky Networks are immensely proud, said Chairman/ Managing Director of Sky Media Networks Niranga Hettiarachchi.
Hettiarachchi is convince that Rasa FM will become a success as it is aimed for the entertainment of the masses. He guaranteed that Rasa FM will attract a loyal and devoted audience.
A lot of research has been done and there was a favorable response, and we firmly believe that Rasa FM will really make an impact on the FM Channels, added Hettiarachchi. Chief Executive Officer of Sky Media Networks Chaminda Wickramasinghe said that the main intention of Rasa FM is to rekindle the taste of the audiences. There have been radio channels in the past that have appealed to audiences and that is a truth. But with Rasa FM what we want to do is to make a difference. However I feel that they have gone off track. They have not kept up with the youth of this country. When it comes to the youth, they have lost that appeal. And they have kept up modernism or with the changing times and have not upgraded themselves creating a chasm between them and the audiences, said Wickramasinghe Wickramasinghe went on to say that Rasa FM has address these issues and will be a channel that the young crowd will take great pleasure in.
Sith FM and Red FM, is in the top 10 radio channels in Sri Lanka. These channels have a devoted following. I feel the Rasa FM will even be more successful than both these channels. I also feel that Rasa FM will be a great strength to Sky Networks. It is our ambition to make all three radio channels great. These three channels  Sith, Rasa and Red will really change how radio is viewed, explained Wickramasinghe.
Program Manager at Sky Media Networks, Chathuranga Thenuwara, said that over the years perceptions have been changed when it comes to FM channels. In way what we want to do is to bring back the prestige and glamor back to FM channels. Our success lies with the discerning crowd. We want a revival.
"And we do feel that we have a loyal following and I am not trying to boast here, said Thenuwara.

Red Bull Campus Cricket sixth edition gets off the ground
The search for a team to defend the islands global Red Bull Campus Cricket title is set to begin, when Red Bull Campus Cricket  National Finals (Sri Lankas) kicks off on July 3.
The stakes for Sri Lankas Red Bull Campus Cricket tournament are higher than ever this year. Not only are twenty college sides set to take part, the winning outfit will progress to the World Finals, also to be held on the island in September  where expectations will be high for another rousing Sri Lankan showing. Last year, Business Management School (BMS) put together a scintillating campaign at Galle International Stadium, to triumph the World Finals.
This year, with the quality of cricket and fan interest expected to be at an all-time high, Sri Lanka is set to decide which local team will represent the island in a tournament spanning across seven days.
Thurstan College and Bloomfield Cricket & Athletic Club grounds play host to the preliminary rounds, on July 3, 4 and 5 before the Quarter Finals are played at Thurstan on July 6 and 7. The action then moves to the P Sara Oval  one of Sri Lankas most storied cricket venues  where the Semi-Finals and Final are scheduled for July 21 and 22.
Sri Lanka cricketer Niroshan Dickwella, who captained 2016s victorious BMS side, said the tournament afforded benefits that stretched far beyond the cricket field.
The level of play in the Red Bull Campus Cricket tournament was incredibly high, but more importantly, we made friendships from cricketers all around the world, he said. When I was in South Africa on national duty this year, I was able to catch up with some of the South African cricketers from Tuks Cricket, whom I had met through Red Bull Campus Cricket. Those are connections I really cherish, and I hope to make more of the same as I play in this years event.
Red Bull Athlete Lahiru Thirimanne expected this years tournament to be highly competitive. In the years Ive been involved with Red Bull Campus Cricket, Ive seen it become a tournament where it now attracts many highly skilled young cricketers. he said. Im expecting to see plenty of promising talent in 2017, and with the attention BMS victory got last year  plenty of fan support as well.
Now in its sixth year, RBCC will again see sides from Australia, Bangladesh, South Africa, India, Pakistan, UAE and new comer Zimbabwe  each of whom will have qualified via their own national competitions. This will also be the 4th occasion in which Sri Lanka hosts the World Finals.

SL to promote tea in non-traditional markets - Navin
Targets USA, Latin America
In a drive to expand Sri Lankas tea exports to non-traditional markets, Sri Lanka is to come up with a major promotional campaign to expand its tea exports to the United States and Latin America, says Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake.
Minister Dissanayake citing China as a potential tea market to be tapped noted that Sri Lankas tea exports to Iran have increased while Sri Lankas tea market in Russia has shrunk a bit.
Moreover, the government intends to develop coconut as a billion dollar industry.
Sri Lanka Tea Board has released tea production data for the month of May 2017 confirming a figure of 29.4 million kgs which is nominally lower than the previous years figure of 30.8 million kgs.

All three elevations recorded lower figures compared to the previous year. The 129 million kgs, January to date figure, is still higher than the 128.5 million kgs recorded for the same period last year. Low Grown teas were about 1.3 million kgs more than last year, but the high and Medium Growns are now nominally lower than last year.

Sri Lankan boat people sent home
The return of Sri Lankans from Christmas Island to Colombo overnight on a government charter jet has fuelled speculation that Australian Border Force has intercepted a suspected asylum vessel in the past week.
A plane chartered by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection has left the Australian territory in the early hours of yesterday with about 20 peoplesome of them guards and interpretersonboard. Sri Lankan nationals were led up the steps of the plane with a guard on each side.
Christmas Island residents linked the deportations to an unusual spectacle last Thursday when two of the navys rigid inflatable vessels were seen towing a small boat close to the horizon.
The last known intercept of an asylum vessel on its way to Australia was in March.The March monthly update on the departments website stated: During this period, Australian authorities worked with the government of Sri Lanka to return 25 people who were detected and intercepted attempting to reach Australia illegally by boat, in accordance with Australias protection obligations.
An Australian spokesman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton yesterday declined to confirm any new intercept.
The Sri Lankan government has been willing for some years to swiftly take back failed asylum-seekers stopped en route to Australia.
A fast-tracked method of returning asylum seekers was developed under the Gillard Labor government, when authorities first tested an expedited screening out process on Sri Lankans intercepted near Cocos (Keeling) Islands. This involves asking intercepted passengers a short series of questions while they are still at sea, such as why did you come here If the answers are not deemed to trigger Australias obligations, the passengers are returned to their country of origin by boat or plane.
Australias largest patrol vessel Ocean Shield visited Sri Lanka and India last month, the first official visit by an Australian Border Force vessel to those countries.
Australian Border Force commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg was there to receive the vessel at Chennai Port.
Australia values our strong relationships with Sri Lanka and India, Quaedvlieg said.
Ocean Shields visit was an important opportunity to strengthen co-operation and support our common goal of ensuring safety and security across our maritime domains, he said. The Ocean Shield crew exchanged expertise in operational techniques with the Sri Lankan navy and Indian Coast Guard.
During the sustained wave of boats between 2008 and 2013, Christmas Island sometimes held more than 6,000 immigration detainees.
It now operates one detention centre with fewer than 1,000 men, but many of them are not asylum-seekers.
Instead, the centre has become a place to hold mostly men who are citizens of other countries and have committed crimes while living in Australia. Once their jail term ends, they are transferred to immigration detention to await deportation. (The Australian)

Sri Lankans would rather forget this day : Sri Lanka-South Africa World Cup Quarter final-18 March 2015
The day started bright with clear blue sky and a hint of rain clouds gathering far away. Outside the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG), spectators with Sri Lankan and South African flags were wending their way towards the gate. At the time we got to the venue, about half an hour before the start, our flags were outnumbering the Proteas flags. Everyone seemed happy and excited having great expectations of their respective teams. There were vehicles of all shapes and sizes near the car park full of our supporters who had travelled all the way from Melbourne and Canberra. I flew to Sydney from Melbourne the previous night and was on our way to the SCG with some friends of mine. We were all kitted up for the event with Sri Lankan T-shirts and hats and caps. We were to meet with some more of my friends near Gate C, each of us fervently hoping for a Sri Lankan win. However this seemed to be a tall order.
As we got off after parking the car, we saw a couple unpacking their match goodies from their vehicle, since they looked like South African fans I asked them what do you think - will we be going home happy or will they be going back happy. The elderly lady with a sweet smile replied, We will be happy anyway dear. We are Australians and come to watch good cricket. After the match I felt bad when I thought about that couple for I felt for once that our Sri Lankan team has let them down. That ladys comment summed up how most of us felt coming for the match. Even though no one was sure what the result would be, everyone expected to watch quality cricket going by the recent performance of both teams. Unfortunately it was not to be.
The atmosphere even outside the ground was festive with the papere band going full swing with young fans singing and having a great time. There were smiles everywhere and people speaking without listening and joking with total strangers. While going to our seats I spotted many friends who have come from Melbourne. Unlike at the MCG here at the SCG I found the spectators to be evenly spread, even though there were different pockets of Sri Lankans and South Africans fans. In Melbourne at the MCG, Bay 13 is the place to be for Sri Lankans; starting from Bay 13 Sri Lankans seems to occupy the area on either side of it. Here in Sydney they seemed to be more evenly spread right around the stadium.
When it came on the Big Screen at the grounds that Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews had won the toss and had elected to bat, there was a roar from the crowd with waving of Sri Lankan flags. Sadly for Sri Lanka that was to be the only high point for the rest of the day. Obviously no one new this at the time and our spirits were high although no one has consumed any spirits at the time! The singing of the National Anthem tends to evoke emotion and a sense of pride of your country, when you live abroad than listening to it while you are on home soil. It was no different for us when the National Anthems were played at the SCG. Especially at the cricket matches the National Anthem I believe brings about your patriotism and awareness of ones origin to the fore.The South African National Anthem which had verses sung in Swahili, Afrikaans and English had a beautiful tinge to it. As we sat down after the National Anthems my recently acquired friend Lilith who was next to me, mentioned how nice it would be if a Tamil verse too was added or included in the Sri Lankan anthem. I couldnt agree with him more. If I may venture to air my view I firmly believe such a gesture would make all the ethnic groups in Sri Lanka feel inclusive, as not only our nation, but our sporting and other teams have reflected the inclusiveness of all ethnic groups at all times.
Sri Lanka succumbs to Pakistan
The win against India a few days back, looked like a flash in the pan. Sri Lankans were going at a canter with Dickwella and Mathews settling down to a nice rhythm. However as it happens, both were out one after the other and the score stood at 161 for 3. At this moment in time the Cardiff wicket came to life and the ball started to move and lift and Junaid and Amir made the ball talk. The Lankan batsmen were no match for them. Chandimal again played down the wrong line and got castled, for some unknown reason he is having a dismal tour and it is having a telling effect on the team as a whole. Our fielding too let us down badly; they looked to be too eager and nervous and were disappointing. Even at the latter stages, although we fought back, they dropped Sarfraz Ahmed, Thisara Perera dropping a dolly at mid-on. So ended the champion stakes for Sri Lanka but they performed better than expected.

Tolerating religious intolerance
Developments unfolding in Sri Lanka over the last few weeks look ominously similar to those in 2013-14 when a surge in targeted attacks against minority Muslims and Christians went unchecked by the Rajapaksa administration.
The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka, an umbrella organisation for civil society groups, has recorded 25 attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned establishments since April, and the National Christian Evangelical Alliance of Sri Lanka has reported over 40 incidents in 2017.
Amid growing concern among civil society and the international community, as well as mounting pressure on the government by Muslim MPs, reassurance came from the highest levels. President Maithripala Sirisena asked the Law and Order Ministry to act against perpetrators without fear or favour, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe vowed tougher laws to address hate crimes.
However, a recent remark by Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe did not quite square with the leaders statements. He issued an open threat to disbar human rights lawyer Lakshan Dias for pointing to attacks on the Christian community, while on a television show. That Mr. Rajapakshe, who is also the Minister for Buddhist Affairs, chose to threaten the lawyer rather than counter his argument with facts, has shocked many. International human rights watchdogs have urged the government to take action against the Minister, whose threat they saw as an attempt to silence critics of the governments inaction.
Buddhist Power Force
Meanwhile, controversial Buddhist monk Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, who was in hiding following charges of hate crimes against Muslims, surrendered at a Colombo court on Wednesday, after evading arrest for a month. He was arrested in court, only to be granted bail soon after. Gnanasara Thera heads the hard-line Sinhala-Buddhist organisation Bodu Bala Sena (BBS, or Buddhist Power Force). He has in the past been accused of stoking communal tensions, including in Aluthgama, a southern coastal town where violent clashes claimed four lives in 2014, and faces many cases. Over the last few months, he was again seen airing provocative anti-Muslim sentiments, while reports of attacks in different parts were mounting.
Following 35 complaints, including 21 pertaining to hate speech, the police have arrested 15 people. Arresting a Buddhist leader and arresting a layman is not the same thing, spokesman Priyantha Jayakody said at the Cabinet briefing this week. There were cultural sensitivities to be considered, he said.
His view has to be seen alongside the significant influence Sri Lankas Buddhist clergy wields on the countrys political affairs. A day before Gnanasara Thera surrendered, a powerful Buddhist sect, the Asgiriya chapter, issued a statement attacking the government on its move to arrest the monk. The Council said that while Gnanasara Theras actions may not be acceptable, his concerns about threats to the majority could not be ignored. The government must take corrective action, it urged.
The Prime Minister assured that the government was considering new laws, suggesting shortcomings in existing legislation. But Sri Lankas independent Human Rights Commission noted that the recent incidents amounted to crimes under Sri Lankas Penal Code and its ICCPR Act. Laws existing on the statute books without implementation have a corrosive impact on the rule of law, the Commission cautioned in a letter to the President.
The question that remains is whether tackling religious intolerance is a legal challenge or a political one.

Unmatchable!
In a fiercely competitive industry, Misty has held its own grounds. With so many young and talented bands entering the music industry, Misty is still sought after because of its find blend of unmatchable experience and talent. Daily News speaks to Misty band leader Rajitha Rupasinghe on his competent outfit.
Where the band members are concerned, we work as a team. But every band has its differences. But as a band leader, it is how you put them together and how you gel with them and move forward. I am very lucky. I have band members who have been performing with me for the past 15 years, said Rupasinghe
The secret is in how you recognize them. Even their attitudes and behavior matters a lot. It is very easy to break a band. It is difficult to make a band.
I always listen to my band members and I seek their views and I make sure I guide them. When it comes to success it is all about working hard and taking challenges positively. Every challenge has to be taken in a positive manner and to move forward. We always want to satisfy our audience and we have done that over the last 15 years as a fully-fledged band.
Patience and tolerance are so important within a band. You need to have absolute patience and sometimes you have to tolerate a lot. Over the last five years, in the industry the competition is very high now and very competitive. Credit goes to all these bands who are driving themselves and working hard. So it is difficult to cope up with young talent, and you have to have a lot of patience and understanding. You need that drive to carry you forward and sustain your work, explained Rupasinghe
Rajithas humble beginnings began in 1997 as Misty.
I started my musical career in 1994 as a Duo. So it all came together in 1997, when I got an offer from the Maldives to play at a resort in one of its many islands. I was looking for a break to start things on my own. And I thought this was the ideal platform for me to go abroad and gain some momentum for my career and receive exposure. So I took off to the Maldives in 1997. I was there for nearly two years.
I decided then to come back, because there I found that there is nothing much you can do since you get stagnated in one resort. So I came back in 1999 to Colombo. I could not fit into the Colombo Circuit straight away. So then I moved to Down South. Robinson club is a club I used to play for predominantly Germans. So I was performing at Robinson Club for about six to eight months.
Then I slowly worked my way into Colombo. So Misty was operating as a duo, then a trio and at the latter part as a quartet, before I formed a fully- fledged band in 2002. So that was my turning point -I gained popularity in the pub and club. These were places like Galadari, JAIC Hilton, Clancys were places where my career really benefited from, pointed out Rupasinghe

The journey to success was not easy for Rupasinghe and his band.
People came to listen to us and repetitively came to see us. But I must specifically mention Derek Wickramanayake leader of Wildfire. That was an awesome band and they turned the tables for live bands after 2000. Wildfire really set the benchmark for people like us to come up. Derek identified my talent and personally came and told me to form a band! He inspired me and I still thank him for that, added Rupasinghe
The industry is very demanding now, because there are a lot of very talented bands out there now.
Those days there were Gypsies, Wildfire and Ultimate. Those were the bands that were riding high then. Those were the bands that I looked into. It was not easy for me because it is definitely a challenge transforming your duo to a fully-fledged band. The work and looking for suitable members all fell into place, but it was no easy task, pointed out Rupasinghe.
As mentioned above the strength of Rupasinghes band lies mainly with their experience.
My band members  Dennis (on drums) and he is my most senior member and has been with me for the past 15 years now. Then there is Sanjeewa, he used to play with bands like Cosmic Rays. One of the most renowned members I have is Udaya. He is a veteran and an experienced musician. He has been in Switzerland and Germany before he came and played for Aquarius. He is founder member of Apple Green and a member of Friends. In the early 90s Friends was one of the best beat bands here. Now he has been with me for nearly ten years. Then there is Sudath on guitar. Sudath played with Ultimate. And my female vocalist is Melina, elucidated Rupasinghe.
The challenge was to form a band at that time. But due to the countrys situation and where the entertainment industry was at that time, Rupasinghe thought it was risky to form a band straight away.
That is why I started out as a duo. But thanks to people like Derek Wickramanayake and later on Imran of Funtime who recognized my talent things moved in favorable direction.
I feel when you are a professional musician you need to have originality, you have to have your own music. Originality is good, but nowadays I feel that whatever you produce has to be rich musically and lyrically, also it has to be rich. If you are thinking of producing your own music, you need to think of these factors. The music you make should have lyrical and musical value and it should give a message to the public. I personally feel that whatever is in your mind and if you think it is something that the public would want to listen to, you should put it out. Because it is nice to be creative and relevant for that matter. For example, what is happening in our country and in the world today, explained Rupasinghe
Versatility is also a feature when you take into account the many personalities of the band.
We are a very versatile band. We cater to a wider audience. So I do not want to label myself. We play from Jazz to Country and to Pop Rock, which we love the most. I personally like lots of 70s and 80s music and the modern day R&B and Hip Hop.
Sunil Perera has inspired me a lot. I listened to his music as a kid. When music is concerned the first thing that comes to my mind is the Gypsies. To being a musician and to becoming who I am - Sunil Perera played a big role, stated Rupasinghe.
The band believes in what they do best and that is music.
And we do this to the best of our ability. We believe in our strengths and each one of us are unique. I have a lot of talent in this group of mine. They are dedicated. We have been blessed as a touring band. We are one of the most toured bands in this country.
We have been to USA for the past 11 years and we have been to Australia for the past 12 years. And we have traveled to other parts of the world. From Japan to New Zealand, Canada to the Mediterranean. To Europe and to Asia and Asia Pacific and the Middle East. We are fortunate to travel frequently to all parts of the world, shared Rupasinghe.
The band has its biggest fan base in Australia. We enjoy everywhere we go. The demand in Melbourne is really big. For me the most memorable concert is the one celebrating 10 years.
That was in 2012 and that was one heck of a concert! It was at Waters Edge.
That was sold out in 10 days. That was our Anniversary concert, summed up Rupasinghe.

Vettel is disgrace, prove youre a man-Hamilton
Baku: Lewis Hamilton branded world championship leader Sebastian Vettel as a disgrace and challenged the German to prove youre a man after he deliberately crashed into him in Sundays tempestuous Azerbaijan Grand Prix.
Four-time world champion Vettel was given a 10-second stop-go penalty for driving his Ferrari into the back of Hamiltons Mercedes while they were following the safety car after 19 laps on the Baku street circuit.
Hamilton, who was leading after making a clean start from the 66th pole position of his career, had initially slowed to avoid the slow-moving safety car ahead of him, an action that may have caused Vettel to drive into the rear of his Mercedes.
This damaged both cars - loosening further the head-rest in Hamiltons car so severely that he was ordered to pit on safety grounds for repairs - and caused Vettel to lose his temper by pulling alongside Hamilton and then turning into him.
I think its just not the correct driver conduct, said Hamilton, picking his words as he spoke to reporters.
Its dangerous driving and to get a 10-seconds penalty for that... I dont need to say anything else.
Vettel, who had accused the Briton of brake-checking him, had served his penalty during the race after the stewards decided his actions added up to dangerous driving. Hamilton was not reprimanded or punished.
The three-time champion Briton added later: I didnt brake-check him at all. For him to pretty much get away with driving into another driver is a disgrace. I think he disgraced himself today.
If he wants to prove he is a man we should do it out of the car, face-to-face. Imagine all the young kids watching today -- seeing that kind of behaviour from a world champion.
I know my boys will be devastated [about the head-rest issue] but I think its important to take away the great performance throughout the weekend. AFP

Vista Rooms partners with over 50 villa and apartment owners  to deliver an end-to-end hospitality solution
Vista Rooms, South Asias largest chain of affordable stays, is expanding operations to include apartments and villas in their portfolio of properties.
Following a wave of success with standardizing and branding budget hotels across the island, Vista Rooms is now set to be a complete turnkey solutions provider for the private stays segment.
They offer end-to-end support to villa and apartment owners  right from tech, to sales, to regulatory and operational support.
This expansion into the informal tourism sector comes as the sector is experiencing a surge in popularity in recent years.
We are seeing a greater desire from tourists for more authentic stays. Travellers are seeking localized, personal experiences and apartments and villas are great alternatives to hotels that can help meet this need. Hence we are excited to move into this segment where we see a lot of potential for growth. We believe the key to unlocking this potential is in building trust with the customer by providing them with a quality stay.
This is where our turnkey solutions will help hosts navigate the usual pitfalls of the hospitality industry, said Ankita Sheth, Vista Rooms Co-Founder.
Vista Rooms has already tied up with over 50 apartments and villas across the island and has begun providing an off-the-beaten-path experience to tourists. This burgeoning segment is only set to grow further with the increase in global awareness of Sri Lanka as an excellent holiday destination thanks to a concerted push from the tourism board. Locals, too, find it easy to book a quick weekend getaway with Vista Rooms.
We work on a franchise or a complete turnkey model with property owners where we offer our brand, technology and sales network in serving global travellers. Our property owners have on average seen their occupancy increase by 15-20% in the first three months of operations by accessing our global distribution network of over 100 online and offline travel agents, corporates and repeat customers said Vista Rooms Co-Founder, Amit Damani.
Vista Rooms follows an asset and people-light model. Having opened operations in Sri Lanka in March 2016, Vista Rooms has already built the largest network of branded stays in the country with over 300 properties across 25 cities.
The same swift growth can be expected from the brand going forward, as they begin catering to a large, untapped demand segment. The online startup believes that their technological prowess, the ability to offer good quality, standardized experiences and stellar customer service will uplift the segment and create greater demand.

For whom the apocalypse tolls
Despite numerous disasters, Sri Lanka is yet to see a proper contingency plan. People have lost their lives, Properties, owned by both government and private institutions, have been damaged. Politicians and officials, who are supposed to take necessary actions during a disaster, seem to capitalise on the disaster with their media shows of helping the affected.
Several announcements, in the meantime, have been made to advise people to evacuate their residential areas. However, have they been informed of any particular destination in advance and what to take before evacuating
The Buddha once spotted a queue of black ants and gave a smile. Venerable Ananda Thera asked why. Each black ant, the Buddha explicated, had been a celestial king in a previous birth. The karma leads one to either hell or heaven in the next birth, irrespective of whatever position they currently hold.
Hence, one needs to understand the danger and suffering of this long samsara journey.
AWARENESS
The people in identified areas should be made aware in advance by:
1. Pasting a notice in all such houses informing them the place allocated for them to go for shelter and advising them what should be taken along with them including the documents
2. Issuing identity cards for them to wear
3. Issuing life jackets to each person with instructions how to wear
4. Pasting a notice referring to important contact numbers. These contact numbers could be approachable before or during the disaster
5. Pasting notices on how to protect properties of people leaving their houses.
MANAGEMENT OF REFUGEE CENTRE
Refugee Centres in each divisional secretarial areas should be identified. The following factors should be attended to.
1. Have a record of how many male and female refugees can be accommodated
2. Plan temporary separations for changing clothes
3. Install permanent generators
4. Prepare names and addresses of people with their working skills to be accommodated with copies to be given to Divisional Secretary, Grama Sevaka and heads of centre.
5. Obtain the consent of the heads of centre.
6. Identified skilled persons can be used to attend to electrical repairs, plumbing, civil, cookery etc.
7. Construct male/female toilets on a permanent basis with water tanks, shower cubicles, store rooms, working staff accommodations, doctor-room with the clinic, sick room and kitchen facilities.
8. Install temporary radio communication sets.
9. Lockers to keep valuables and store during the occupation.
10. Temporary water bowsers.
11. Deploy security staff 24 hrs at entrances.
12. Adequate staff to manage during operations. Government officers can be detailed similar to election duties.
13. Provide adequate lights, plug points etc.
14. Install TV in a common sheltered area during operations or permanently.
15. Keep notice of all important agencies to contact for assistance.
16. Provide adequate holdalls to each person with pillows and sheets when possible
17. Provide separate areas or tents for each family.
18. Activate operation centres for 24 hrs. Managed by the Police and Grama Sevaka.
19. Whenever possible, a study room for students.
20. Receipt books and registers to acknowledge all donations.
21. Appoint committees that consist of the head of the centre, the police and the Grama Sevaka. A few civilians should be chosen from the area to meet daily and monitor operations of the centre and take suitable action when necessary.
22. Provide petty cash through the Divisional Secretary.
23. Common standing order/ circular must be issued to all centres regarding its management.
ROLE OF THE DIVISIONAL SECRETARY
Each office must have a generator in case of electricity failure. The DS offices of all affected areas must have an additional building with space for storage of goods such as cooking utensils, holdalls and tents. A room should also be allocated for the DS who should be on 24-hour duty to rest. A standing order/circular should be issued offering the DS more powers in spending and hiring during the disaster period. Detailed lists of all people with their addresses, skills, contact numbers, under each refugee centre under each Divisional Secretary, should be provided. Identify the requirement of staff to each centre and how their services can be obtained. Identify the requirement of vehicles and logistics and how and from where they can be obtained or hired. All emergency and contacts where services can be obtained should also be explored. Activate the operation Room for 24 hours.
A Radio communication set should also be installed permanently. Preparation of common standing orders, circulars regarding the responsibilities of the DS and the Grama Sevakas during the disaster period is also necessary. Have maps of affected areas indicating the refugee centres, place of floods, landslides etc with the number of females and males to be given shelters.
Appoint officials to accept donations to manage stores, distributions and maintaining records and issuing receipts for all donations. Provide petty cash to each centre with a standing order to manage. Prepare lists of requirements to each centre including repair work and how and from where such facilities can be obtained. Have a list of standby electricians, plumbers, civil workers and generator technicians to obtain services during the affected period on payments.
DISASTER MANAGEMENT CENTRE
Activate the operation room 24 hours with representatives from all government and private agencies involved in disaster management work.
Have adequate telephones and radio communication sets of police and three forces operated by those officers. Maintain all records of affected areas including people and properties. Appoint a media officer with staff. Arrange daily discussions. Prepare a standing order/circular as to how the management centre should be operated. Appoint staff to obtain foreign donations, store and issue through the relevant officials. Rent or purchase a large storehouse to store the foreign donations and other purchased items which can be used during a disaster. Prepare a detailed work plan regarding the prevention of disasters in consultation of professionals and ensure implementation.
Appoint a team of Architects, structural engineers and civil engineers to plan out to build houses on concrete columns with costs and provide free professional services to the public. When possible, arrange bank loans and provide financial assistance. Prepare a detailed plan regarding post-disaster period for implementation.
COLLECTING CENTRES
All private collecting centres, collecting donations, must be registered with the Disaster Management Centre in advance. A form should be issued for all, who seek registration and the local police and the Grama Sevaka should make their recommendation before accepting them as collecting centres.
All such collecting centres should be made accountable for all collected donations.
A circular must be issued regarding the management of such centres and the records to be maintained. The collecting centres, once registered, should be issued with a registration number and a certificate.
RESPONSIBILITY OF POLICE
The police at station, division, range and headquarters levels, must activate operational rooms. Sufficient boats with life jackets should be issued to all police stations in the affected areas since they will have difficulty in transportation. All station OICs should ensure protecting the lives of the affected and their property. The police personnel also should be deployed to provide security to all refugee centres and also to manage the operation room of such centres with a police radio communication set.
RESPONSIBILITY OF ARMED FORCES
The officers of armed forces have carried out their duties satisfactorily in the past and will continue the good work in a more planned manner. However, the army personnel must be issued with adequate boats and life jackets to carry out their duties more effectively.
RESPONSIBILITY OF MEDICAL STAFF
A doctor and at least two nurses with adequate medical equipment and drugs should be made available at all refugee camps during the activated period. The arrangement must be made to have the services of an ambulance in a short period to all centres. All government hospitals must have adequate staff, equipment and drugs.
I have given a very brief report above and recommend appointing a team of professionals and administrators to study and prepare a detailed report. The report can indicate guidelines, instructions, logistical and human resources requirements under each responsible person, organisation, institution and refugee centres.
This subject should be treated as urgent and important in view of all damages caused to human lives and the private and government properties.

This will be my final season - Bolt
Ostrava: Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt insists this emotional season will indeed be his last, bringing the curtain down on a glittering career which galvanised track and field at a time of doping and corruption scandals.
Bolt has won eight Olympic and 11 world gold medals in his career, but importantly was the outgoing, larger-than-life personality on whom athletics administrators could rely for a positive slant, an athlete widely recognised globally. Asked whether he might carry on after this season, Bolt said: No, I dont think so!
Its just been a great career, Ive really enjoyed the ups and downs, all the experience Ive gathered, all Ive been through, the happiness and the sadness.
Its been a wonderful career and Ive done everything Ive wanted to do and its coming to an end and Im fine with it.
Speaking ahead of Wednesdays IAAF World Challenge meet in the northeastern Czech city of Ostrava, Bolt admitted that the season was an emotional one. Bolt, 30, confirmed that he would not be competing in the 200m in London, but left the door open to a further finale being added to his programme.
For sure I wont be running the 200m at the worlds, he said. People keep asking, but no. AFP
