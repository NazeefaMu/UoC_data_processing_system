Action should be taken for previous regimes crimes
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka highlighted the importance of taking action against those who committed crimes during the previous regime without delay by respecting the mandate given by the people, yesterday.
By taking action against the members of government, the President and the Prime Minister have shown that there is no political revenge behind these investigations and that they only want to take action against the real culprits in a transparent manner, he added.
The Joint Opposition (JO) has no ethical right to criticize the role of the presidential commission of inquiry appointed to investigate the treasury bond issue, the Minister said.
Addressing the media yesterday at the JHU office, Minister Ranawaka said that the JO has no backbone to raise their voice against Basil Rajapaksa, who was involved in various financial malpractices during the previous regime.
Refuting the allegations made by various groups claiming that the presidential commission of inquiry appointed to investigate the Central Bank bond issue has no power to take any action against culprits, Minister Ranawaka said that there are two types of presidential commissions; ordinary and special commissions.
Special commissions have the power to make recommendations for punishments and ordinary commissions can make recommendations to take legal action.
But most people do not know that the powers vested with the ordinary presidential commissions of inquiry had been extended during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime.
The presidential commission of inquiry appointed to investigate the bond issue was appointed with additional powers. So it has power to investigate the case, make a report and refer it to the Attorney General to file court cases under criminal law or civil law, based on the facts gathered by the commission.
The Central Bank bond issue is not a simple case, because it has badly affected the social, political and economic sectors of the country. The Perpetual Treasuries Company, which started their business with a Rs. 300 million capital in 2014, had earned a profit of more than Rs. 25 billion by April, 2015.
Responding to a question asked by a journalist with regard to Justice Minister Wijedasa Rajapksa, the Minister said that the UNP should decide whether Minister Wijedasa should continue his position as a minister of the government or not, since he is a member of the UNP.

Negotiating of BIMSTEC Free Trade Area should be expedited
Foreign Affairs State Minister Vasantha Senanayake emphasized that in order for the BIMSTEC to become a viable regional organization connecting South Asia and South East Asia, the negotiations related to the BIMSTEC Free Trade Area should be expedited.
He said the relevance of BIMSTEC may truly be envisioned only after the proposed FTA comes to fruition.
The State Minister attended the 15th Ministerial Meeting of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) in Kathmandu, Nepal, on August 11. The Meeting marked the 20th Anniversary of the BIMSTEC and provided an opportunity for the leaders to take stock of the achievements and failures of the BIMSTEC during the last 20 years.
The Meeting emphasized the need to expedite the negotiations on the conclusion of BIMSTEC Free Trade Area (FTA). The Ministers focused on many important areas of interest to the membership and the regions including establishment of BIMSTEC Grid Interconnection - a framework agreement, a BIMSTEC Centre of Technology Transfer Facility, and expressed strong commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations in the BIMSTEC region.
They agreed to constitute an ad-hoc Expert Group to establish the BIMSTEC Buddhist Tourist Circuit and Temple Tourist Circuit in the region. The State Minister said the need to focus on the growth of the BIMSTEC economies taking cognizance of United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals as the guiding principles in the BIMSTEC collective march towards achieving growth and development.
The Meeting was attended by Foreign Ministers of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Thailand.During his stay in Nepal, State Minister Senanayake had bilateral meetings with the Prime Minister of Nepal Sher Bahadur Debua, the Indian Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nepal Krishna Bahadur Mahara and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bhutan Lyonpo Damcho Dorji.
The BIMSTEC was established in 1997 under the Bangkok Declaration in Thailand connecting the South East Asian and South Asian regions, to build an alliance to harness shared and accelerated growth through mutual cooperation on different areas of common interest.

Producing bio-degradable polythene, possible
Industrialists belonging to the Polythene Producers and Recyclers' Association are capable of producing bio-degradable polythene and plastic products, said Association President Anura Wijetunge.
The association pointed out their ability to do so when they met Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen for discussions on August 8, he said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo on August 10, Wijetunge said they pointed out to the minister that the livelihood of nearly 300 businessmen and several lakhs of workers engaged in the polythene and plastic industry would be disrupted directly and indirectly when the ban on polythene and plastic use comes into force from September 1. They pointed out that they were capable of producing polythene and plastic that would disintegrate within one year and thereafter, completely decay due to micro-organic activity within five years, without causing any environmental pollution. They pointed out that the biodegradable technology would be used for this production.
He said they could change over to this technology within a short period using the same machinery. The cost would also be very low and these products could be marketed at the same prices prevailing in the market today.
Wijetunge said they pointed out that the new hydro bio-degradable technology to be introduced shortly would be costly and unsuccessful because even though polythene and plastics produced in this manner would disintegrate, it would produce methane gas after mixing with earth. Moreover, industrialists would have to purchase completely new machinery to change over to this production and the products would also be more costly in the market. For instance, a lunch sheet would cost nearly Rs. 7 to Rs 8. This showed that the entire industry would face danger if it used the hydro bio degradable (compostable) technology.
Therefore, the association hoped to have further discussions with authorities to create awareness on this matter and make representations to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too on this matter shortly. Minister Bathiudeen promised his support towards their effort, he said.

Bar Association condemns aspersions cast on AGs Department

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) today strongly condemned accusations levelled against the Attorney Generals Department in relation to its role at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond issue.
BASL President U.R. de Silva told a press conference in Colombo that accusations should come with evidence and materials through a proper forum, without causing damage to the Attorney General Department's reputation.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Treasury Bond issue is vested with power to control the behaviour of any officials during the hearing. If anyone criticizes the Commission and Attorney General Department from outside, it would undermine the authoritative power of the Commission and public could lost their trust in the Attorney General Department, he said.
It is alleged that the officials of Attorney General Department aggressively questioned former Minister Ravi Karunanayake but were reluctant to prosecute large scale frauds committed during the previous regime.
BASL President U.R. de Silva however accepted the fact that there is a delay in the disposal of cases by the Attorney General.

Brexit: UK suggests 'temporary customs union' with EU

The UK has set out the "ambitious new customs arrangement" it wants to secure with the EU after Brexit.
Ministers said the plans would mean the "freest and most frictionless possible trade" with the rest of Europe.
This could include a "temporary customs union" after Brexit to prevent border problems as the UK leaves the EU.
Businesses have called for clarity since the UK said it was leaving the customs union - the EU's tariff-free trading area - as part of Brexit.
The customs union document is the first of a series of papers to be published by the UK government on key negotiation issues.
On Wednesday it is expected to set out proposals for the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.
What is the customs union
Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs - taxes on imports - on each other's goods.
Every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad.
So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee.
Other goods - such as soap or slate - have no tariffs.
The UK's departure from the EU's customs union was confirmed at the weekend in ajoint articleby Chancellor Philip Hammond and Trade Secretary Liam Fox.
A 'streamlined' border
According to the newly-published government paper, the UK could ask Brussels to establish a "temporary customs union" after it leaves the EU in March 2019.
But during this period, it would also expect to be able to negotiate its own international trade deals - something it cannot do as an EU customs union member.
Once this period expires, the UK will look to agree either a "highly streamlined" border with the EU, or a new "partnership" with no customs border at all.
The government said the interim arrangements would mean businesses would only have to adjust once to the new arrangements.
All of this will have to be negotiated with the EU - and the two sides have not yet even started discussing trade matters.
Other obstacles - including the size of the UK's "divorce bill" - need to be agreed first.
Mixed UK reaction
Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said the proposals were "incoherent and inadequate" and were designed to "gloss over deep and continuing divisions within the cabinet".
"These fantastical and contradictory proposals provide no guidance for negotiators or certainty for businesses," he added.
Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said the plan would "only delay the economic pain caused by leaving the customs union".
"We still face the prospect of more red tape for businesses, longer queues at our borders and higher prices for consumers once the transition comes to an end."
However, the CBI, which represents British businesses, said the proposal was "encouraging".
Its deputy director general, Josh Hardie, added: "The clock is ticking and what matters now is giving companies the confidence to continue investing as quickly as possible."
Analysis: UK 'hustles' Brussels
Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels reporter, said the UK was seeking a customs union agreement "that will keep things broadly the same for an interim period - an attempt to reassure business".
"Firms will be told they'll only have to change their processes once," he said.
"In Brussels, EU negotiators are likely to stick to their position that that the future relationship can't be considered until agreement has been reached on their priority issues - the rights of citizens, a financial settlement and the Irish border."
BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the UK government was "straining to show that it does have a route-map for Brexit".
He said ministers were also attempting to "subtly" put the issue onto the negotiating table sooner than Brussels wants.
"They want to hustle EU negotiators into talking about trade much sooner than Brussels intends," our correspondent said.

An Emirates Airbus A380, the largest commercial passenger airliner in the world, landed for the first time at the Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday.
As the two-deck, four-engine plane taxied into the terminal, two fire engines sprayed the plane and its 550 passengers with water cannons.
The one-time flight demonstrated the airports new capability to handle large aircraft, representatives from Emirates said. The BIA completed an expansion to its runway in April.
A senior Emirates Vice President said the airline would begin flying A380s to Sri Lanka regularly if the market grows.
Emirates is the largest operator of A380s with 95 planes flying to 47 destinations.
Government officials, industry representatives and journalists toured the airplane after it landed, which has private showers, lounges, first class suites and a spa.
Yet even as Mondays flight was meant to show off the BIAs new capabilities, the airport is struggling to update its infrastructure.
At a press conference at the terminal, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said plans for the expansion of the airport had stalled.
According to de Silva, the ministry had secured a loan from the Japanese government to fund the work, but subsequent bids came in at 47 percent higher than engineers had estimated.
We have to sort out these issues, he said.

No state land sold to any foreign hand -Mahinda Amaraweera
After the land transaction with Shangri-La, no public property was sold to any foreign individual or an overseas state, remarked State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera.
He was making the key note address at the Galle district Sri Lanka Freedom Party convention held on Saturday at Hall De Galle.
Today, all party members can boast of an unblemished and genuine Sri Lanka Freedom Party. We could on principal end enduringly the direct sale of state property to foreigners or any foreign state.
After the notorious Shangri-La land deal where straight possession of Sri Lankan soil was sold to an overseas firm, we did not allow any government property to be sold to foreign hands.
As long as we are in the National Unity government, we would not allow such deals. We stopped many similar attempts during the recent past.
It was during the previous regime that arrangements had been made to sell the Hambantota Port. We could halt such destructive moves and win many victories for the country through directing the present government in the right track," he further remarked.
"We are not prepared to hang onto the coalition government forever. We do not want rule the country in combination with the United National Party persistently. We formed this government to achieve some vital aims and objectives with utmost national importance. We joined the present government on a collective decision taken democratically with the majoritys agreement of the party. We never betrayed our party, he added.
At present, some baseless rumours are spread by the opposition alleging that we are afraid of elections. If President Maithripala Sirisena dissolved the Parliament soon after his presidential victory, the SLFP would have suffered a major election defeat. Had we faced the Local Government election at that time we would have lost the power of all Local Government bodies. However, the President evaded such great setbacks to the party, he pointed out.
We are not scared to hold elections. We will hold the Local Government elections before the end of this year. I urged all party organizers to prepare lists of potential contestants for the forthcoming LG polls.
We have further decided to hold three Provincial Council elections also. The Provincial Council elections may take precedence over the LG polls. A favourable political ground to win the elections has been fashioned for us throughout the country.
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party will contest all upcoming elections as a single party. Public will not be misled and they will use their vote wisely. They will vote for the politically clean and virtuous representatives.
Erudite and intellectual public will rally round clean and genuine leaders. Youth are always against corruption and fraud. We should formulate a workable national strategy to attract such social sections. We invited the moderate Joint Oppositions loyalists also to join with in our principled mission.
However, we did not receive a good response from them. President Maithripala Sirisena is the only such national leader in contemporary politics that can be trusted as a genuine leader with a gallant national vision and a mission.
During the previous Presidential election we worked wholeheartedly for the victory of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as he was our party candidate.
We did everything we could for his success. We gifted the people all possible assistances.
We did not work for President Maithripala Sirisena at the said election for he was not our party candidate.
We love our beloved party, but people rejected the former President as he was violently charged with corruption, fraud, manipulation of national wealth and sponsoring family prejudice, Amaraweera said.

Perpetual CEOs opposition to phone and laptop, struck down
The Treasury Bond Commission yesterday rejected a submission made on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries CEO Kasun Palisena questioning the power of Commission of Inquiry on making an order to handover communication devices belonging to him.
Kalinga Indathissa PC made the submission on behalf of Palisena.
The PCoI issued an order on August 01, under section 7 of the Commission of Inquiry Act, directing PTL CEO Kasun Palisena to produce his mobile communication devices and laptop computers and also to submit an affidavit containing information relating to the use of these devices other than at the stage of Palisena giving evidence.
Indatissa PC made a submission on August 3, that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the treasury bond issue, has no power to require Palisena to produce his mobile communication devices and laptop computers.
The Commission notes that there is no merit or substance in Indatissas submission that, this Commission of Inquiry has no power to require Mr. Palisena to produce his mobnile communication devices and his mobile computer devices other than at the stage of Mr. Palisena giving evidence.
Issuing an order yesterday (14) PCoI observes that such submissions were not made when Arjun Aloysius and Arjun Mahendran were ordered to hand over their mobile communication devices and laptop computers. On August 4, Palisena produced two mobile phones to the PCoI which were kept under sealed cover in the custody of Secretary of the PCoI.
Palisena was permitted by the PCoI to retain his mobile computer device until he complete his evidence. Palisena is testifying before the PCoI at present. The Attorney General will be cross examining Palisena then.
The PCoI also disagreed with Indatissa PCs submission that procedure followed by the Commission of Inquiry up to now is flawed as a result of the PCoI not having formulated Rules. It also did not agree with another submission made by Indatissa PC stating that it is only the PCoI which may determine the witnesses to be called and when they are to be called and record statements of witness, instead of the Attorney Generals Department summon, determine to summon or record statements from witnesses.
The minister made special mention about the delays in hearing court cases and added that steps have to be taken to rectify anomalies.
He went on to say that files on 80 cases related to corruption and fraud committed during the past regime have been handed over to the Attorney Generals department about one year back after completing investigations.
The minister lamented the delay in taking legal action against those responsible for the malpractices and added that in this backdrop it was natural for one to feel whether such delays were intentional.

Sri Lanka hoping to play Pakistan T20 in Lahore

Sri Lankaiscommitted to playing at least one Twenty20 International against Pakistan in Lahore in September if all logistical and operational plans fall in place.
Thilanga Sumathipala, the chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket, at the conclusion of the Asian Cricket Council Annual General Body meeting in Colombo on Sunday (August 12) said that his cricket board had already sent security experts to assess the situation in the same Pakistani city where the Sri Lankan team bus was attacked on its way to the Gaddafi Stadium for a Test match against the host nation on March 2009.
Since that incident, top teams have stayed away from travelling to Pakistan  only Zimbabwe of the Test-playing countries visited Pakistan, in 2015, for three T20Is  and it will be a huge shot in the arm for Pakistan cricket if Sri Lanka was to return to the scene of one of the darkest moments in cricket history.
I am keen to take my team to Pakistan, Sumathipala said. We have had our security experts visit and make an assessment, and things look positive with things improving all over the country and especially Lahore being cleared. We have three T20 games coming up against Pakistan in September, and we would like to play at least one of those games in Lahore.
Calling for Asian unity and appealing to all members of the ACC to back Pakistan, he went on, There is always risk  there were two attacks in London during the Champions trophy, but cricket continued under the security assurances of the ICC, so likewise we too must be as accommodating and understanding as possible with our members and extend our fullest support to them as the cricketing family of Asia. Sri Lanka suffered through three decades of terrorism and war and at one stage no one wanted to come here  Pakistan stood by us then, as did India.
The 33rd AGM of the ACC was presided over by Najam Sethi, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board who has also been recently appointed the ACC chairman, and attended by representatives of 19 countries.

Taylor Swift wins assault case against DJ

Pop star Taylor Swift has won a sexual assault case against ex-radio DJ David Mueller, who she said had groped her at a 2013 concert.
He assaulted her by grabbing her bottom beneath her skirt during a photo shoot, a jury in Denver, Colorado, found.
She was awarded a symbolic $1 (77p) in damages that she had sought.
Mueller had originally tried to sue the pop star, saying that her claims had cost him his job. But that lawsuit was thrown out by a judge last week.
On Monday, the jury also rejected similar claims Mueller had made against the singer's mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell.
In a statement following the verdict, Swift said: "I acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this.
"My hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves."
The assault took place during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour.
Mueller, then a host on the radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show.
The singer complained to KYGO and the station fired Mueller two days later.
Last Friday, Swift's former bodyguard gave evidence, supporting her sex assault claims by testifying that he saw the DJ reach under her skirt.
Greg Dent told the Colorado court he "did not see his hand touch her physically", but "saw his hand under her skirt".
