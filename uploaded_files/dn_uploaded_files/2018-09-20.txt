Digitalising supply chain management vital
To keep up with the ever-changing technological advancements in the world, companies will need to invest in supply chain technologies to enhance their customer centricity and reduce total cost of ownership, said Ravind Mithe, Head of Management Consulting Operations- KPMG India.
He was speaking at the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT), International Conference 2018, held under the theme, Staying Relevant In A Digitally Connected Future, in Colombo yesterday.
He said that emerging technologies today are likely to reinvest or reshape all steps of supply chain and these emerging digital technologies are at different stages of maturity, and therefore supply chains need to incorporate or respond to them as they become significant.
Customers today are engaging differently with brands creating a profound effect on how companies position themselves in the market place. In addition, digital technologies are hitting the market place, making much needed changes in supply chain practices in every five years.
We have to digitize supply chain management to make it more relevant in the digital world, he said. Every five year a new digital wave comes, in which you can actually ride on. With that new wave, you can change your organization. If you dont change your organizations on that wave; you will go under the wave. It is very important that CEOs are recognizing that they need to change and disrupt to be relevant in the market place, he said.
In this context, the companies will also need to look for more technology enabled skills in their team rather than in traditional supply chain and IT experience.

No sugar price hike
The Finance Ministry yesterday reiterated that sugar prices will not be pushed up in the local market under any circumstances due to an increase in the import tax.
The Ministry in a press release added that the price of sugar has seen a drastic decrease due to surplus in supply. The import cost of a kilo of sugar has reduced to Rs.55 from Rs.75 due to bumper harvest in sugar producing countries such as India, Thailand and Brazil.
Excerpts from the statement: The government has brought the import of sugar under general tax structure by lifting the special commodity tax of Rs.31 per a kilo of sugar with an objective of saving local sugar producers.
Accordingly, a tax of Rs 42 is imposed on an imported kilogram of sugar as sugar importers have to pay excise duty, port charges, national building tax when importing sugar under general tax structure.
The importers are still earning a profit even after increasing tax on sugar as sugar prices have decreased in the world market.
The Government will take stern action under the Consumer Affairs Authority Act, if sugar importers, distributors increase the retail price of sugar in the local market. The government removed the maximum retail price for sugar as sugar prices has been on the decrease for several years with an objective of giving its advantage to the consumers.
If the necessity arises, the government will impose a maxium retail price, the statement said.

100% LC margin on  vehicle imports
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka imposed a 100 per cent margin deposit requirement against Letters of Credit opened with the commercial banks for the import of motor vehicles, which are generally used for non-commercial purposes, with immediate effect.
Accordingly, Letters of Credit for the importation of these vehicle categories could be done only with a minimum cash margin of 100 per cent, the bank said in a press release.
The decision to impose the margin deposit requirement is based on recent developments which, if not addressed, could threaten macroeconomic stability. These include, recent global financial market volatility and generalised pressure on currencies of emerging market economies, continued excessive motor vehicle imports, partly driven by unwarranted speculation on future exchange rate movements, interest rates movements and budgetary measures.
The imposition of the margin deposit requirement, together with the measures already taken by the government with regard to taxes applicable on motor vehicle imports, is expected to curb non-essential imports of motor vehicles, and ease undue pressure on the current account of the balance of payments (BOP) and the exchange rate.

ADB $10 mn loan to SL
The Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a $10 million technical assistance loan to finance the establishment of a facility that will help improve the design and implementation of urban projects in Sri Lanka, particularly with climate resilient and inclusive features to make cities more livable.
Urban projects are complex and require meticulous and significant preparation time to ensure they deliver their intended development impacts, said ADB Senior Urban Development Specialist Ron Slangen. The ADB-supported facility will ensure urban projects rolled out in the country are impactful, sustainable, and beneficial to the people of Sri Lanka.
There is a need for better and timelier delivery of urban infrastructure services in Sri Lanka, with more than 20% of the countrys population living in cities that contribute about 40% of gross domestic product.
However, based on ADBs experience in Sri Lanka, there is a need to strengthen long-term strategic investment planning and engineering capacity in urban departments to meet the increasing challenges of urbanization.
These factors have posed issues to Sri Lankas development as they limit the number of readily available investment-grade projects, result in implementation delays, and ultimately affect the timely delivery of benefits to the people.
The facility, financed by ADBs ordinary capital resources, will strengthen project readiness and institutional capacity in Sri Lankas urban sector through advanced feasibility studies and detailed designs that incorporate climate and disaster resilience as well as gender-friendly features in up to 29 cities.

In a shocking development, Henry Cavill reportedly is no longer part of the DC extended universe as Superman.
According to a report, the actor, who first appeared as superhero in 2013s Man of Steel, and later reprised his role in Superman V Batman and last years Justice League, is parting ways with Warner Bros.
According to insiders, the development comes after talks of Cavills cameo in Shazam! did not come to fruition due to scheduling conflicts. Theres a recognition that some parts of the previous movies didnt work, said the studio insider.
Another source said that Warners is trying to hit a reset button with the DC universe.
Talks are on to find new face for the beloved superhero.
Superman is like James Bond, and after a certain run you have to look at new actors, said a studio source.
It is being said the studio has shifted its focus to a Supergirl movie, which will be an origin story featuring a teen superheroine, which effectively removes an actor of Cavills age from the storyline as Superman, aka Kal-El, would be an infant, according to DC lore. Another voice adds that the studio is unlikely to make a solo Superman film for at least several years. Hollywood Reporter

Frequent strikes
Strikers are paid their allowances and salaries by devious means for the period they are on strike. Doctors, university employees, postal workers and railway workers all get this unlawful payment.
University students on strike were paid their allowances. In this country, strikers do not have to get the approval of the general membership by secret ballot as is done in the UK and in Singapore.
As a result, the union committee alone decides on whether to strike or not. Thuggery is a common feature among strikers. The non-payment of wages is deterrent to frequent strikes.
It would be appropriate in the national interest to have the Auditor General to report soon after each strike on the amounts and employee categories who were paid and his findings released to the press without delay.

Covestro goes online to sell polymers in China
Covestro AG, a German producer of high-tech polymers, is tapping e-commerce on an experimental basis in China.
The China market is the single largest contributor to Covestros global sales. The company, formerly known as Bayer Material Science, expects to boost its total global sales via online channels to 1 billion euros ($1.17 billion), by the end of 2019, said Markus Steilemann, its CEO.
Polymers are used in a wide range of industries to enrich raw materials used to produce products.
We have great opportunities in terms of development here in China, particularly in e-commerce, because this is a market still very experimental, where customers love to try new things.
Steilemann said consumers in China are very curious. That exactly fits Covestros mindset and DNA ... and is also helping develop new products and e-commerce opportunities. Thats why we think we have a very good opportunity in China to develop things ... and thats why we have decided to launch a web shop here.
Covestro launched an online store on Chinese internet giant Alibabas online platform 1688 in April.
By offering high-tech polymer materials, including high-tech material polycarbonate and preproducts for polyurethane foams, coatings and adhesives, the web shop hopes to reach new customers in China who might be already buying from other shops on 1688.
We did not consider other countries for this particular venture. We didnt want to partner with another large B2B or B2C platform anywhere else because we thought the conditions to start and conditions to experiment are better here than in any other large market that we have.
The Covestro online store on 1688 is not chasing big revenues. Instead, it is deepening its understanding of potential customers in China, Steilemann said.
Chinas online shopping trade volume is projected to reach 6.1 trillion yuan ($888 billion) by this year, up nearly 30 percent year-on-year, according to iResearch data.
An iResearch report showed revenue from Chinese small and medium-sized B2B platforms totaled 29.17 billion yuan in 2017, representing 17.5 percent year-on-year growth.
The e-shop in China is in line with Covestros new e-commerce strategy. The company has already built its own e-commerce platform.
E-commerce is one of the largest and greatest business opportunities for the entire chemical industry, and Covestro is among those that adopted the e-channel route early, Steilemann said.
We have some customers who now choose services and products via this platform. They receive promotional offers for products they need but are not aware of. It works exactly like Alibaba, but just that the environment is exclusively for the chemical products.
In 2017, Covestro generated 3.1 billion euros in revenue from the China market, or 22 percent of its global revenue. Since 2001, it has invested more than 3 billion euros in China. (Chinadaily.com)

DSWDOA War Heroes hold special general meeting
The Defence Service War Disabled Officers Association (DSWDOA) held its special general meeting on September 16 at Ape Gama in Battaramulla with the participation of a large gathering of Commissioned Offices of the Army, Navy and Air Force who had sustained battle injuries and were later subjected to premature retirement from their respective services.
Despite their commitment to ensure freedom of the country and its people since 2009, these War Heroes who had suffered injuries and had to leave the service are facing a depressing plight, especially upon reaching their retirement age of 55. This is the time that they need the assistance of the government the most. Therefore, with the aim of obtaining the assistance of the government in resolving their grievances that these injured officers of the Tri forces, have formed this non-political association.
During their meeting, the group proposed and seconded the proposals to have their pay continued after the retirement age of 55, have the duty free vehicle permit re-activated for the disabled, be granted promotions, parallel to their peers upholding their dignity, be issued with a standard identity card, and permitted to contribute to the Army Benevolent Fund.
The DSWDOA expressed its gratitude to Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake for having taken immediate action to resolve their issues pertaining to the issuing of a standard identity card and permitting them to contribute to the Army Benevolent Fund.
During the discussion, the members reiterated the concerns and their difficulties on the treatment procedures for medically board out officers.
The theme song of the DSWDOA was also released and the official web site was launched during the meeting, which can be accessed on www.dswoa.lk
The DSWOA also unveiled their reforestation initiative under three phases titled Green War supported by the popular musical group Api Machang.

Fitch rates Singer Sri Lankas Debenture Final A-(lka)
Fitch Ratings has assigned Singer (Sri Lanka) PLCs (A-(lka)/Stable) senior unsecured debenture of up to Rs 1.5 billion a National Long-Term Rating of A-(lka).
The debenture will have a tenor of three years and carry fixed coupons. It will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, with proceeds to be used to refinance existing debt. The debenture is rated at the same level as Singers National Long-Term Rating, as it ranks equally with its other senior unsecured obligations. The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on 20 July 2018 and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
Recovery in Sales Volume: We expect demand for consumer durables to pick up in the medium-term as consumers adjust to higher costs, supported by an earning recovery in the agricultural sector, continued low personal taxes and stable interest rates. Singers consumer electronics and home appliance revenue growth slowed to 1% in 2017 on weak demand, after two years of double-digit growth, due to higher indirect taxes and a prolonged drought that affected the livelihood of a significant proportion of Sri Lankas population.
We believe Singer was able to better respond to the weak demand compared with peers due to its defensive product portfolio and strong brand presence. Growth in IT, Digital Media: Fitch expects Singers IT and mobile segments to be key growth drivers in the medium term, aided by Sri Lankas increasing smartphone penetration and short replacement cycles compared with most other consumer durables.
Singer is the countrys largest smartphone retailer and exclusive agent for Huawei, Sri Lankas second-largest smartphone brand. Singers IT and digital media revenue has increased at a CAGR of 57% over the past five years.
We expect it to maintain its market leadership for the next three years, with the renewal of its contract with Huawei.

Fundamental problem of Currency Depreciation
Policy-making on exchange rate and BOP
While market participants do businesses within their resources and market forces, there is an extensive network of state policy-making authorities in the area of fiscal, monetary, exchange, administrative and coordination/extension/marketing connected with exchange rate and BOP. Deliverables, policy instruments, statutory principles and powers of respective policy-making authorities along with Cabinet level supervisory lines are clear on paper. This is why some analysts blame the government for the BOP deficit and currency depreciation among many other causes.
The Central Bank always gets blamed on this subject while the names of other policymakers are hardly traced. The reason is the explicit and lead role of the Central Bank with a wide spectrum of monetary, exchange, credit and regulatory policies directly related to the subject as revealed from principles and provisions of the Monetary Law (effective from the establishment of the Central Bank in 1950) and Foreign Exchange Act (along with the Exchange Control Act operative from 1953 and repealed in July 2017).
The much-spoken intervention in the foreign exchange market to stabilize or control the exchange rate and the maintenance of the international reserve are only desk-jobs carried out by the Central Bank as there is no communication as to whether those are carried out as part of the wider monetary and foreign exchange policy aimed at finding solutions to the BOP and currency problem. Given the prevailing economic management bureaucracy of the country, the statutory roles of all state policy-making authorities are part and parcel of both the problem and the solution. However, at the last count, the exchange rate stability is the public duty of the Central Bank under both the law of the land and conventional central banking.
The problem solutions  some options
There is no doubt that the problem resolution will take at least a decade or more, given the geopolitical complexities that arise from both local and global fronts. The solution depends on whether the government, present or future, is able to align their economic policy package aggressively (monetary, fiscal, regulatory, administrative and marketing) towards the improvement of the countrys productivity to generate a BOP surplus on a sustainable basis. This is how many countries such as East Asian countries emerged in the world economy in the past. Policies such as export promotion zones are to create the productivity and comparative advantages on selected products through the ease of bureaucracy and provision of policy support within the particular zones without touching the general problem of the countrys low productivity.
China has extensively used this strategy to attract foreign direct investments in a large scale first and then to gain the productivity and competition through foreign investors/multi-national companies of the advanced market economies. As a result, productivity and competition have become borderless.
The new knowledge in the globalized world of resources, production, trade, technology and markets is now amply available for designing and implementing of new policy and business strategies. New markets are such that even corner-households around the world are in the global supply chain of the productivity, production, trade, capital and consumption that countries could utilize to uplift the living standards of the people. Therefore, Sri Lanka has no turn-back to the state-controlled closed economy model to solve the BOP problem and has to find solutions through the competition in the prevailing globalization.
As free markets are not permitted to fix the fundamental problem, the state economic management bureaucracy has to drive the solutions. Fact-finding reports and strategic reports can be made in any volumes at a cost to the public, but will not help to fix the problem unless the relevant bureaucracy touches the roots of the problem.
In this context, preparation of ultimate targets for the BOP surplus/deficit along with targets for key sub-sectors such as trade balance, current account balance, net foreign capital inflow and foreign reserve to be achieved in next 5-10 years, preparation of a list of broad policy areas and relevant authorities (from business approving authorities to the Central Bank, foreign business promoting institutions and diplomatic missions) that have statutory duties to contribute the achievement of the targets, getting plans of policy actions with targets of respective authorities (covering any area of export promotion, import substitution and foreign investment inflow as appropriate) to contribute to final targets, making required budgetary provisions for them and making them publicly accountable to respective line targets are required. This will not happen without the commanding role of the CEO and key management personnel of the state economic management team as in the case of business management firms.
If the new policy package is aggressively set in motion by the elected government, the market mechanism/private sector will eventually work to do the rest as usual. However, given the nature of public service and democracy prevailing in the country, this is by no means an easy task.
If this option is not feasible, another option is to revert the monetary system to the Currency Board system (similar to present Singapore and Hong Kong) that existed until the establishment of the Central Bank in 1950. Then, there will not be discretionary money printing against the local assets purchased by the Central Bank.
In this system, the Central Bank will print money only against the purchase of foreign exchange or global reserve currencies. In that context, people can have the currency/legal tender for economic transactions only if they run a balance of payment surplus. As a result, people will reposition all activities of the economy to gain productivity/comparative advantages for foreign trade. This is a good solution for island economies.
John Exter proposed a modern central bank for the country to have a discretionary monetary policy in view of the resource base and opportunities that Ceylon had at that time. Therefore, he empowered the Central Bank to have the national monetary policy covering both domestic front and international front to facilitate the countrys BOP (see sections 63(2), 65, 66 and 77(1) of the Monetary Law Act and 5(b) and 5(bb) of the Monetary Law Act up to 2002 -only few of provisions), foreign reserve and stabilization of international value of the currency.
However, the Central Bank has not done it continuously. Its new monetary policy approach is the one followed by the advanced market economy central banks which is the open market operations in the inter-bank overnight market to regulate its liquidity to maintain interbank interest rates within the interest rate targets announced by the Central Bank. Therefore, it is doubtful that the Central Bank will move out of this convenient desk-top monetary policy to abroad national monetary policy that has been empowered by the Parliament in 1949 as recommended by John Exter towards the BOP. However, the Central Bank as the public debt manager has been resorting to raise foreign borrowings for the government and own currency swaps with banks/foreign currency dealers at a loss to the country to build a foreign reserve in order to stabilize the exchange rate and finance BOP deficits through open market operations in the foreign exchange market. As a result, this borrowed reserve has primarily driven the money printing in the country. Therefore, nearly 70% to 85% of total money printing/Central Bank balance in the recent past has been based on the acquisition of foreign assets. In this context, the Central Bank is already a type of an unconventional Currency Board which prints money primarily backed by the proceeds of foreign borrowing as against the normal Currency Boards system of printing money backed by the foreign trade surplus.
If both of above options are not feasible, ad-hoc policy-tinkering such as tax/tariff revisions, subsidies, administrative prices and advisory/consultancy reports prepared with the help of international experts initiated from time to time based on isolated political views would no doubt keep the economy and the BOP problem in the loop as has been in the past. In this environment, the private sector will find covered market trades and foreign exchange to finance their deficits. Illegal foreign remittances including money laundering will take place in covered markets as the country needs foreign exchange to continue with the exiting open economy model. In addition, foreign debt bubble will continue to expand to finance the official BOP deficit.
Handing the speculation connected with the currency
Meantime, as currency markets are highly speculative for quick profit on trade of currencies, governments have to use regulations to tame the currency dealers on real time basis as there are many dark corners in between the dealers and regulators. Manipulations in currency markets are globally well-known. Currencies of EMs generally do not appreciate although there are periods of stability due to tighter regulations and real business activities in the global front. In the event of lax regulations and shocks in the international economic and financial front, currency markets of some countries end up in turmoil. Those who are responsible for regulation of currency markets also should be responsible for currency turmoil too as they have not done their duty by waiting for disasters to happen. Therefore, excessive speculation or market manipulation also could be a major factor in unhealthy movements of the exchange rate. This situation has to be handled by specific regulations and investigations into market abuses of dealers by the regulators in order to curb the excessive speculation on the exchange rate.
One of the instances of currency turmoil after the Asian currency crises is the Turkey which is an economically advanced country heavily dependent on global trade and finance. Its foreign reserve declined from US$ 120 bn in November 2017 to US$ 103 bn in July 2018. Private sector foreign debt stood at about US$ 242 bn with short term debt accounting for only about 8% whereas total short-term external debt was about US$ 180 bn. Meanwhile, inflation rose to 16-18%. The central bank was handling the situation through short-term interest rates in the monetary policy to deal with capital flows as the foreign investment position was the foundation of the economy. Its currency which was around 3.8 lira per US$ in January 2018 started heavily depreciating to 6.3 on August 10, 2018. By August 13, 2018, currency depreciation rose to 6.92.
Therefore, the currency turned into turmoil causing contagion across many countries including several big European banks. At the onset of the turmoil, the central bank increased its policy interest rate by 425 basis points to 17.75% in May and June 2018. Yields on treasuries rose to 25% for two years and 22% for 10 years in Mid-August. Currency dealers were demanding more rate hikes everyday and the countrys President took the policy front to his hand and put the country on currency war front to settle the turmoil with the support of regional political dealers. As a result, the currency got back to just below 6 on August 20, 2018. However, it widely fluctuated between 6.20 and 6.50 later, despite drastic regulations, due to currency dealers pressing the central bank to raise interest rates. Inflation rose to 18%. Finally, the central bank raised one-week repo rate to 24% on September 13, 2018 by about 600 basis points and dealers were calmed down. As a result, the currency improved back to 6 per US$ within few hours. This shows that currency management is not something that can be done in standard economics due to its strong connections to geopolitical factors and speculative currency dealers.
Another example is how the Central Bank of Sri Lanka handled the speculative attack immediately after the float of the Rupee, i.e., moving to the flexible exchange rate regime without exchange rates announced by the Central Bank, on January 23, 2001. The Central Bank, similar to Turkey, implemented a tight exchange regulation policy package designed and fine-tuned under the wisdom and stewardship of the then Governor A S Jayawardena, a veteran central banker of all round, to control excessive speculation. The rupee was floated by dropping the exchange rate band of buying rate of Rs. 77.40 per US$ and selling rate of Rs. 85.13 per US$ under the managed float system that had initially commenced in November 1977 by moving out from the pegged/fixed exchange rate regime that prevailed before. As a result, the exchange rate depreciated to around Rs. 98 within the course of the next day in the inter-bank market due to collusive behaviour of some dealers identified as reckless.
Imposition of the maximum limit on forex position of banks, suspension of pre-payment of imports, 50% margin deposit on foreign currency forward sale contracts and recovery of accommodation to exporters only from export proceeds with maximum 90-day recovery period were the first-time unconventional monetary policies implemented to strengthen the supply of the dollar against the artificially speculative dollar holding in the market. The banks were examined on daily basis to ensure that they complied with the new requirements to the letter and spirit. The Governor got daily reports to follow up on the progress. With the policy package and aggressive moral suasion, the exchange rate got settled at around Rs. 85-86 within about two weeks. Few currency dealers were about to be punished, but settled amicably since the market became disciplined. This kind of market discipline cannot be achieved without an active and impartial regulator.
The same policy package was reimplemented in 2009 too to control a similar instance. Two of them, i.e., bank forex position limit and recovery of accommodation to exporters, are still effective, but with subsequent relaxations. Especially, if banks have been permitted to operate with higher limits of forex positions, they have a greater space for speculations at such times. Currency dealers care about profit and not the national interest of the currency value. Unlike in January 2001, the market now after 17 years must have developed to a high level of discipline under the surveillance of the Central Bank and any excessive depreciation of the currency has to be connected with some way of collusion of dealers if the Central Bank continues to state that the currency market conditions/fundamentals are not so adverse as various analysts explain. By now, currency dealers may have remitted out a lot of investments made in government securities to cut marked-to-market losses on currency depreciation which precipitates further currency depreciation and speculation as usual.
Once they get the currency depreciated to a high level they wish, they will get foreign investments back at cheaper prices. This is the usual speculative game seen in many countries. As these dealers and investors are well known to the Central Bank, they can be controlled only by the Central Bank. The outward-remittance of foreign exchange by low profile companies/shell-type companies (who do not earn any foreign exchange) in permitted amounts, but huge in total of all, annually to invest abroad which is not monitored by any regulator is also a significant threat to the borrowed foreign reserve of the country. This is another area which has a lot of dark corners. Therefore, a lot of micro-regulations is required in place of macroeconomic approaches to exchange rates to handle market manipulations. Only what the Government can do is to seek the assistance of friendly countries and multinational institutions to get some help to borrow Dollars. Definite consequences of the unsolved problem
In the current world economy and markets, there is no turn-back to a closed/controlled economy. If the BOP problem is not fixed through the improved productivity and doing globally competitive businesses, the BOP deficit has to be continuously financed from the Central Banks international reserve.
This international reserve is the foreign exchange cushion built primarily from proceeds of government foreign borrowing as there is no private sector BOP surplus for the Central Bank to purchase. In fact, foreign borrowing and international reserve are a spiral in the loop and it is the government foreign borrowing that will eventually finance the BOP deficits and protect the currency. The Central Bank projection to increase in the international reserve based on foreign receipts to the government is only a desk-top work to please the public and not a policy announcement. For example, the Central Bank in early May announced a projection for the increase in the gross foreign reserve from US$ 9.1 bn in May (a healthy level) to US$ 11 bn by mid-June 2018 out of proceeds of foreign loans and receipt on the lease of an asset to foreigners and communicated that a part of its unprecedentedly large foreign reserve could be used to trigger even a material appreciation of the rupee to prevent unwarranted depreciation of the currency, particularly as the depreciation is not justified by the underlying fundamentals. However, the gross foreign reserve at the end of June was only US$ 9.3 bn and the currency has further depreciated to about 162 to-date.
Mervyn King, the former Bank of England Governor and a veteran policy economist wroteTo retain credibility, it is important that central banks do not claim to know more than they in fact do. And it is clear that central banks are not able to provide accurate forecasts of their own actions. Policy must confront the fact that stuff happens. Making forecasts is inherently difficult. They always turn out to be wrong
It is a terrible experience that a central bank which has so wide monetary powers to develop the foreign trade of the country and to hold a foreign reserve adequate to protect the currency projects to fulfil its national duty of maintaining a foreign reserve on the basis of government borrowings and governments sale of controversial national assets to foreigners.
Therefore, the currency defense by the Central Bank by using the tiny, debt-ridden international reserve is only an administrative price control, despite the wide purview of the monetary and exchange policies of the Central Bank applicable to the subject. Only a part (not more than 60%) of so-called healthy foreign reserve of US$ 9 bn valued in modern accounting or forecasted US$ 11 bn is available for the currency defense due to other commitments and risks associated with foreign reserve assets. Further, this reserve is a rolled-over portfolio maintained primarily through the roll-over of government foreign debt and short-term currency swaps with banks. Therefore, given the underlying structural BOP problem, nobody can consider this kind of international reserve as a fundamental to protect the value of the currency and to maintain the investor sentiments. If the international reserve is raised to a magnitude of at least US$ 25-50 bn, we can be complacent to have some brave talks and keep the exchange rate at Rs. 160 or 155 or even 150 per US Dollar for some time. Since the market comes to know that the Central Bank keeps the exchange rate artificially over-valued through a subsidy granted from the countrys international reserve, the rising demand for cheaper foreign goods and services will eat the foreign reserve in no time. Even the short-lived memory tells us the lessons of failures of such currency defense or price control, including attempted appreciation of the currency in the recent past by selling several billions of the foreign reserve to the market.
Therefore, the direct danger of the unresolved BOP and exchange rate will be the transfer of the deed of an unmanageable stock of countrys foreign debt to the future generations. Rising foreign debt further to finance the current model of open economy and to protect the currency at whatever level possible from time to time will be a strong signal of the countrys on-going macroeconomic and systemic vulnerability. In the event currency dealers who are connected to international capital flows and foreign investors get activated at any time on various geopolitical reasons and links, the foreign debt bubble will burst and drag the country to economic and social catastrophe.
I hope above information and thoughts will provide some constructive inputs for a wider discussion to help policy-making authorities and market participants to design and implement desirable solutions in the wider national interest, despite diverse views and debates, if they really wish to commence now.

Helping hand for potato farmers
The All Ceylon Consumers Co-operative Federation (COOPFED) would assist potato farmers by purchasing 200 tonnes of potato at Rs.95 per kilo daily, from September 21, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister Ravindra Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the media at his ministry on Tuesday, to discuss and find solutions to problems faced by potato farmers.
Minister Samaraweera said potatoes grown by farmers in Welimada and Uva Paranagama usually reached the market between September and December.
According to reports, the stocks reaching the market roughly included 4,000 metric tonnes in September, 13,000 metric tonnes in October, 8,000 metric tonnes in November and 4,000 metric tonnes in December.
Minister Samaraweera said earlier, he proposed a levy on imported potatoes to protect local farmers, and that the Cost of Living Committee decided on a tax of Rs.40 per kilo.
When the local crop was harvested in September, the price of potatoes recorded a sharp drop to Rs.60 per kilo, leading to protests by local farmers. Although they requested the imposition of a Rs.10 tax on imported potatoes, they found that traders who had already completed imports would also add the tax to their sales and hence, had to drop the idea.
An arrangement made with the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) to purchase local produce also failed as the CWE had certain limitations on purchases.
After discussions with the Department of Cooperatives, COOPFED, Keells, Cargills Food City and Arpico, they agreed to purchase a small amount of potatoes at Rs.100 per kilo.
At the discussion, COOPFED agreed to purchase potato stocks, if they were provided with the necessary facilities. Now, COOPFED would purchase 200 metric tonnes of potatoes daily, six days a week. As COOPFED had asked for storage facilities, the ministry had arranged them free of change, Minister Samaraweera said. He said in future, they would hold discussions with the Finance, Agriculture and Trade Ministries to prevent the unlimited import of potatoes, and ensure that imports are limited to bridge the gap between demand and produce.
It was also decided to take measures to assist local farmers to reduce their production costs. State Disaster Management Ministry Secretary Kapila Jayasekara, Badulla Government Agent Damayanthi Paranagama, as well as representatives of the Cooperative Development Department, COOPFED, Cargills, Keells, Arpico, and the Potato Farmers Association were present.

Hockey to be revived in Kandy
Hockey is to be revived by the present committee headed by R. Maheswaran and his committee. Kandy, the hill country capital, is where hockey was first played, with a proud record of producing some of the top national hockey players and captains both men and women. Hockey in Kandy dates far back as far as 1907, when the Indian Rajput Regiments occupied the Kandy Military Barracks, currently known as Police Barracks. During that time St. Anthonys College was housed at the present St. Sylvesters College premises and they used the barracks square for all their sports. The boys of that era felt drawn to the game themselves and tried their hand at knocking the ball around with a borrowed stick or two. The fearless youngsters found some places vacant whenever the military men did not turn up for their games. Gradually, more boys found the glamour of the game irresistible and in a matter of few months threw down the gauntlet themselves and were soon at grips with the Indian Military men.
Glancing through some old records, the first Bully Off in Kandy was in 1907 at the Bogambara grounds, when the Kandy Sports Club and the Industrial School Team met. The leaders of these two pioneer clubs were Europeans, S.R. Hamer and R. Sparks. These two clubs played regularly and had opposition from the Regiments stationed in Kandy.
The Kandy SC packed with European planters, also met Dimbulla ACC and Dickoya MCC. Somewhere in 1910, a new club was formed, the Kandy Rovers. They had the Vanlangenberg brothers Hugh and Lloyd, Wicky and Percy, all first class players. In addition, they had Edwin Boulton, a teacher at Kingswood College, and H. John Gaye a teacher at SACK.
Charlie Hamilton was a little 10-year-old prodigy from SACK, who played at centre-half. This lionhearted midget had learned the game the hard way, in the company of the Indian stalwarts. That year, a team from Kandy travelled down to Colombo to play against Colombo Municipal Council and Bloomfield C & AC. The first match was drawn 1-1. The hero of these two games was Charlie Hamilton, whose display had evoked repeated rounds of applause. The anti-climax of this was that, following the teams return from Colombo, Charlie suddenly took ill and died on Nov.5, 1909 after which, the game too, died a natural death.
Once again in 1926, Kandy SC with Europeans, started a tournament. It was revived again in mid 1930s when P.T. Rajan stepped in to re-introduce the game to the schools and clubs along with M.S. Jainudeen. V.D. Paul and J.O. Mendis. At that time only a hand full of clubs showed interest. As the years rolled by hockey flourished in Kandy with several schools in and around Kandy taking to the game. During the World War a large number of clubs and schools including foreign teams played in Kandy. Hockey in Kandy was well organized with local tournaments in full swing. In 1944, the Kandy District Hockey Association conducted one of its finest tournaments where 14 teams participated in the league. Kandy Rovers had the distinction of winning the league championship and also played that year in the Connor Cup and the Andriesz Shield tournaments in Colombo.
In 1950 P.T. Rajan presented a trophy named the P.T. Rajan Cup for the league tournament. Matale who played in the Kandy League, were gradually making their presence felt and won the league championship under George Mant, the man who took hockey to Matale from Kandy.
As years rolled by hockey flourished in Kandy with several schools in and around Kandy taking to the game. During World War II, a large number of clubs and schools, including foreign teams, played in Kandy. For the good service done by late Rajan, H Marikar who was the Sports Committee chairman of the Municipal Council named Wewalpitiya grounds, popularly known as Rakade grounds, as PT Rajan grounds, which most have forgotten now.
There is an old Antonian who was involved in Hockey, P. Thangavelu, who was on the staff of St. Sylvesters. He has now passed his 90s and knows the entire history of Kandy hockey. He says, during that era, the high standard of hockey was because it had tournaments. Some of the people who kept the game going were Rev Fr Robert M. Perera, S.R. Hamer, G.H. Robinson, K. de Lanerolle, P.T. Rajan, Dr. V.H.L. Anthonisz, George de Saram, Fr. Dom George, Dr. Samad Ismail, R.B. Wijekoon, P. Thangavelu, E.L.Fernando, Leslie Handunge, later people like Paul Jeyaraj, B. Kiridena, I.M. Anwer, Roy de Silva, Rohan Wijenayake, M.D. Rupasinghe, Lakshman Seneviratne DIG, H.

Hong Kong gives Asia Cup champs a scare
DUBAI, Tuesday: Debutant paceman Khalil Ahmed saved Asia Cup champions India the blushes against associate member Hong Kong when he took three wickets for 48 runs to give his team a 26-run win in their opening match played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
After India had run up a total of 285-7 riding on opener Shikhar Dhawans 14th ODI hundred, no one expected minnows Hong Kong to challenge that score.
But to everyones surprise they came within 27 runs of pulling off one of the biggest upsets in one-day cricket and it was only the bowling of Khalil and leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal (3/46) that restricted them to a total of 259-8.
This Group A match was expected to be a one-sided affair but Hong Kong openers Nizakat Khan and skipper Anshuman Rath converted this into a nightmarish one for India by indulging in a record opening partnership of 174 bettering the 170-run stand for the fourth wicket by the same pair against Scotland in 2016.
Nizakat went onto score a brilliant 115-ball 92 with 12 fours and a six and Rath contributed 73 off 97 balls with four fours and one six as they made India sweat for a breakthrough.
However it was here that Indias experience came into play as they got rid of both batsmen in successive overs and was able to put a break on the scoring rate as they picked up wickets at regular intervals.
India rested KL Rahul, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya for the high profile game against Pakistan on Wednesday - expecting an easy contest against Hong Kong, but they were taken by total surprise the way the minnows responded.

Hospitals connected to ease access to drugs
All state hospitals in the country will be included in the Medical Supplies Management Information System (MSMIS) by 2020 under the direction of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Medical Supplies Division (MSD) officials said.
During the Provincial Health Ministers' Summit at the National Blood Centre in Colombo 5 yesterday, they said a new mobile application (app) will be launched for the upper management staff to order drugs over the phone and get them soon.
The system enables state hospitals to share drugs while preventing drug waste and artificial drug shortage. When one state hospital needs a drug which is out of stock, it can be obtained instantly from another nearby hospital where the drug is available using the app, they said.
A total of 579 state health institutions will be included and connected with this system.
The software is already in use in state hospitals.
Now the hospitals can see online where a specific drug is available at another state hospital and obtain it without delay, they added.

High profile Asia Cup match
India bounce back from Hong Kong scare to beat Pakistan
DUBAI, Wednesday  India showed they had recovered from the jitters they received from minnows Hong Kong less than 24 hours before to come out with all guns blazing to outplay arch rivals Pakistan by eight wickets in their high profile match of the Asia Cup played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday.
It was a clinical performance by the Indians who escaped with a 26-run win over Hong Kong on Tuesday. But yesterday they were more of the side a lot of people who are associated with Indian cricket have come to be familiar with.
They first dismissed Pakistan for 162 in 43.1 overs and then knocked off the runs in style using up only 29 overs.
Pakistans total didnt represent much of a challenge to India. An opening stand of 86 off 79 balls between skipper Rohith Sharma who dominated the partnership with a fluent 52 off 39 balls (6 fours, 3 sixes) and Shikhar Dhawan (46) set India on their way to victory that saw them top Group A with two wins out of two. Pakistan finished second with one win and one loss.
India tied down the free-scoring Pakistani batsmen from the very first over of the innings after Sarfraz Ahmed had won the toss and chose to bat first.
The tight lines adopted by the Indian quicks forced rash shots from the two openers Imam-ul-Haq and Fakhar Zaman. Imam charged down the track to Bhuvneshvar Kumar and only succeeded in edging a catch to Dhoni with his score on 2 and Fakhar top edged a pull off the same bowler to mid wicket without a run against his name.
After Kumar had removed both openers in his first spell, the Indian spinners came into play to strangle the Pakistani middle order. They built pressure on the batsmen to such an extent that accounted for Shoaib Malik being run out for 43 off a direct hit from Rayudu at cover.
Malik and Babar Azam had rebuilt the Pakistan innings after they had lost the first two wickets for three runs by putting together a partnership of 82. Just as when the stand was looking to blossom into one of threatening proportions leg-spinner Kuldeep Yadav broke through with a peach of a delivery to bowl Babar all ends up with a wrong un which the batsmen failed to read and was dismissed for 47.
That breakthrough opened the gates for India as Pakistan from a promising position of 85-2 collapsed to 121-7 with off-spinner Kedar Jadhav also joining the party by picking up the wickets of Sarfraz Ahmed (6) and Asif Ali (9) and Shadab Khan (8) cheaply.
Indias fielding was not upto the mark spilling three easy catches two off Malik at 26 (Dhoni) and 37 (Kumar) and one a return catch given by Faheem (13) by Chahal, but they made up for the lapse with some heady bowling to rip the heart out of the Pakistani batting.
India lost all-rounder Hardik Pandya in the 18th over when he was forced to leave the field while bowling his fifth over.
He was taken off on stretcher and it was later reported that was suffering from acute lower back injury. Substitute fielder Manesh Pandey didnt have to wait long to make his presence felt on the field when he pulled of a splendid running catch along the mid wicket boundary to send back Sarfraz Ahmed for six.
Likewise Pakistan lost spinner Shadab Khan midway in his second over having hurt his back. The over was completed by Fakhar Zaman.
India and Pakistan have not met since the ICC Champions Trophy final last year and their rivalry has been intense. But for the politics the two great Asian nations are not likely to meet in a bilateral series other than in a tournament of this nature  the Asia Cup or the ICC World Cup, World T20 and Champions Trophy.
The Asia Cup might produce perhaps a rare opportunity of India and Pakistan meeting each other on three occasions provided they reach the final. They are assured of meeting each other twice with both teams having defeated Hong Kong and having qualified for the Super Four from Group A with Bangladesh and Afghanistan coming through from Group B. Sri Lanka and Hong Kong are the two ousted teams from the tournament after the first round group stage.

India Women go one-up with 13-run win in T20I series
Leg spinner Poonam Yadav claimed 4 wickets for 26 runs as India Women won the first Womens T20 international by 13 runs against Sri Lanka Women at the at the FTZ Sports Complex, Katunayake yesterday.
With this victory India take 1-0 lead in the five match series.
Jemimah Rodrigues (36), Taniya Bhatia (46), Anuja Patil (36) and Veda Krishnamurthy (21 n.o.) took India to 166 for 8 in 20 overs batting first. Chasing 167 for victory, Sri Lanka Women openers Yasoda Mendis (32 in 12 balls) and captain Chamari Atapattu (27 in 22) added 39 in 18 balls. They needed 97 from 78 balls when Yadav started the eighth over. Yadav had Rebeca Vandort caught behind with her first ball and the dangerous Atapattu caught by debutant Arundhati Reddy.
Sri Lanka was five wickets down after Poonam Yadav dismissed Shashikala Siriwardene with the last ball of the tenth over and also got the wicket of Sripali Weerakkody.
Lokusuriyage (45 in 31 balls) counter attacked and found support from Kavisha Dilhari (11) as they added 69 runs off 62 balls. The match was heading towards a tense finish as off-spinner Harmanpreet Kaur sent back debutant Dilhari, but conceded a six off the last ball of the 18th over to bring the equation down to 16 off 12.
Sri Lanka managed three off the first four balls off the 19th over, bowled by Radha Yadav. Then Lokusuriyage hit one back to the bowler Kaur to be dismissed for 45 off 31 balls and with it Sri Lankas chances of winning faded as they folded up for 155.
The second T20I will be played at the Colts Cricket Club ground on Friday.
India Women 168/8 in 20 overs (Taniya Bhatia 46, Jemimah Rodrigues 36, Anuja Patil 34, Udeshika Prabodhani 2/18, Chamari Atapattu 2/23)

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said that National Police Commission (NPC) members should resign if they could not properly investigate the alleged conspiracy to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma questioned as to why DIG Nalaka de Silva had not been arrested. He was addressing a press conference in Colombo yeserdeay
He said the recent transfer of DIG Silva to the IT Division from the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) was also questionable.
Alahapperuma added though the Law and Order Ministry had guaranteed to provide security for President Sirisena after the alleged conspiracy came to light, no such security had been provided for Rajapaksa despite him already having a smaller security detail.

JO divided into Mahinda, Gota camps - JVP
The Joint Opposition group is now clearly divided into two camps known as the Mahinda Camp and Gota Camp , JVP leader MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said.
Since it is mandatory to close all possibilities for Mahinda to become the state leader again, the Gota Camp was opposed to the abolition of the Executive Presidency through the 20th Amendment to the constitution and each camp is involved in a desperate attempt to promote its own leader, he said.
Dissanayake was speaking to the media after calling on the Malwatte prelate, Most Ven.Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala thera in Kandy yesterday to brief him on the 20th Amendment tabled in Parliament by the JVP. He said the JVP was of the view that the Executive Presidency should be abolished and a parliament centred administration should be introduced as it was more fitting for the country.
If the 20th Amendment was approved, Mahinda Rajapaksa could enter parliament on peoples approval and at as the leader of the cabinet of Ministers.
If this happened Gotabayas dreams would be shattered resulting in a crisis in the Mahinda camp for its leadership.
If the 20th amendment was approved, parliament has to be dissolved before March 9 next year and a new general election had to be called. In such an eventuality, the lifetime of Ranils present government would be shortened by seven months, he said.
The period of office of President Maithripala Sirisena would end by the end of next year. But if the 20th amendment was adopted, President Maithripala Sirisena could continue in office after January 9, 2020 subject to the terms of the 20th Amendment.
False publicity was being carried out by some alleging that some parties had teamed up with the JVP and the PM to bring in the 20th Amendment, the JVP Leader said.

Kids IN KITCHEN
Baking Cookies 
Here are the perfect tips for making your baking time together delightful.

Start early 
Schedule baking early in the day when everyone is fresh and well-rested. This is particularly important if you will be working with younger children.

Cover up 
Place a plastic drop cloth beneath the table where the baking and decorating will take place. Dress your children in comfortable, washable clothes and roll up their sleeves. Also pull back long hair.
Try a team approach 
Divide the children into two groups. Put one group to work mixing the ingredients for the dough and then rolling and cutting the dough with cookie cutters. Let the second group begin decorating the already baked cookies.

Get ready to decorate 
Organize small candies and cookie decorations in muffin pans. Put frosting in small unbreakable bowls and provide small plastic knives for safe spreading. Also set out a variety of ready-to-use decorator icings and gels in tubes.

Provide inspiration 
Decorate several cookies in advance and place them in the center of the table to jump start your childrens creativity.








Value of Cooking 
Cooking can be a great way to reinforce subjects being taught at school or introduce new ones. Here are just a few of the skills cooking can help teach your children:

Simple math skills 
Many recipes can be doubled or halved, which will require math skills such as dividing and multiplying.

Nutrition 
Use your time together in the kitchen to teach your children the importance of good nutrition. Encourage them to try new fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods.

Following directions 
Recipes need to be put together in a specific order. This can help show your children the importance of following directions, whether they are baking a cake or doing a science experiment.

Measuring 
Using measuring cups to get the appropriate amounts of ingredients teaches about the importance of careful and accurate measuring.

Sensory awareness Cooking and baking can expose your child to new textures, tastes, colours, odours, and more.
Language skills 
Reading food labels and recipes can help your children improve their reading skills and learn the meanings of unfamiliar words.

Art 
From making a face out of vegetables on a pizza to decorating cookies with sprinkles and icing, cooking provides endless opportunities for artistic expression!

Cultural awareness 
Introducing your children to ethnic dishes may encourage them to learn more about the culture and people that inspired the dish.
Safety in the kitchen is essential at this stage. Be sure that your children do not go near the stove or electric mixers while they are turned on. Keep all sharp knives and other instruments well out of reach.

Lanka on track to US$ 17.2 bn export target- Malik
Sri Lanka is on track to achieve an all time record target of US$ 17.2 billion in total exports for 2018, said Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
Last year was a record year for exports, achieving US$ 15.15 billion in merchandise and services exports, the Minister said. He was speaking at the Presidential Export Awards at the BMICH on Tuesday.
This shows that our exports have increased by 50% over the past three years. However Sri Lanka should not be satisfied with this as other countries are exporting 10 to15 times more.
Singapores exports are US$ 480 billion, Taiwan US$ 340 billion , Thailand US$ 254 billion , and Vietnam US$ 250 billion . I was in Vietnam last week, and observed that Vietnam is one of the few countries in the world where the export value is higher than the countrys GDP, he added.
Being more and more export-oriented, through private sector friendly economic policies and strategies to boost competitiveness, is the only way for Sri Lanka. And our government is committed to pursuing this policy path, anchored to the Vision 2025.
He said that the government is taking several meaningful steps to safeguard local businessmen.
For the first time, we introduced an anti-dumping law to protect our domestic industries from unfair competition from abroad. For 15 years previous regimes had been struggling to get this Act passed in Parliament.

While Mrunal Thakur is a known face on television  she is known for having played the vibrant Bulbul in Kumkum Bhagya (Pinky in Adarei Man Adarei) - critics have praised her for her film debut in Love Sonia, where she is seen in a de-glam role. Having been appreciated internationally for its gritty subject on human trafficking, the film now releases on the wide screen across the world.
Mrunal, who plays the title role of a young woman trapped in the notorious sex trade, said she chose this film as a debut for a particular reason. While most young women would prefer to ideally make their big screen debut with a comedy or rom-com, Mrunal defied norms and decided to make it with Love Sonia instead. She says that while she always wanted to work in films, she chose this one because it was out of her comfort zone, and she wanted to push her boundaries as an actress.
she was thankful to director Tabrez Noorani for giving her an opportunity to work in the title role with a group of super talented and dedicated people. She said that all her male friends were hugely jealous with the fact that she got a chance to share screen space with Hollywood star Demi Moore.
Mrunal said that to prepare for her role, she had to lose weight, attend workshops, meet women in the flesh trade and adapt their mannerisms. TNN

Nail-biting  tales!
Looking good isnt just about wearing stylish clothes and accessories. It is being about well groomed as well. Nails need as much pampering as your hair and face. They are excellent indicators of your overall health. Applying the most expensive nail polish will not work on nails that have not been given proper care and treatment. So groom your nails before adorning them.
Identifying brittle nails
Your nails can be brittle, pitted, discoloured, and flaky and ridged, among other common (and unpleasant) abnormalities. However brittle nails can be a natural part of the aging process.
They are often represented by dry, cracking or splitting nails. They may also grow slowly or simply seem weak and easily breakable.
Brittle nail causes
Brittle nails occur for a variety of reasons. They may be a normal sign of aging or the result of polishing your nails too frequently. When the weather is cold, brittle nails may result from dryness. Weak nails also can be signs of a health issue, such as hypothyroidism or anemia.
Your fingernails and toenails are made up of layers of protein called keratin. Healthy nails are smooth and strong with even colouring and no spots or discolouration. Sometimes healthy nails too can become brittle.
Brittle fingernails tend to be noticed much sooner than brittle toenails. Both the nails on your fingers and the nails on your toes can become brittle for various reasons. It is estimated that brittle nails, also called onychorrhexis, are quite common. In fact, it is estimated that it affects around 20 percent of the population.
Women tend to struggle with brittle nails more than men. When you have brittle nails they are in a weakened state and tend to break, split or peel easily.
Yellow nails
When nails become discoloured, it usually means that you have picked up an infection or nail fungus. It can also mean that your nails have been stained by a product like nail polish, or that you are having an allergic reaction.
Occasionally, nails might turn yellow as a symptom of something more serious, such as chronic lung conditions, internal malignancies, lymphatic obstructions, and even rheumatoid arthritis.
Avoiding nail splitting and chipping
If fingernails are not maintained with a regular manicure, splitting and chipping are inevitable. Nails that are not cleaned properly will allow infection to set up in the fingernail.
Chewing and picking at nails breaks them and also exposes your nails to bacteria from your mouth. Jagged edges that are not smoothed with a file provide an easy surface to snag and tear. Nails that are well-shaped, particularly if they mimic the nail bed, are stronger than nails that are allowed to grow as they will.

Home remedies for dry and brittle nails
Olive oil
To promote growth, it is essential to keep your nails well moisturized. Olive oil is the best when it comes to nail care. It penetrates deep into the skin and nails and thus helps nourish your nails. Plus, it contains vitamin E which improves circulation blood circulation, helps repair damaged nails and promotes nail strength and growth.
Method: Before going to bed, apply warm olive oil to your nails and cuticles and massage gently for five minutes. Wear cotton gloves overnight. Do this once daily.
You can also soak your nails in warm olive oil for 15 to 30 minutes once daily to promote nail growth.

Biotin
A range of vitamins are necessary for healthy nail growth. One such vitamin is biotin, also known as vitamin H. Biotin encourages the growth of nails and hair as it improves the keratin infrastructure.
Slow nail growth as well as nail abnormalities like weak, thin and brittle nails are often linked to biotin deficiency. You can get biotin from food like eggs, whole grains, carrots, tomatoes, salmon, almonds, cauliflower, cucumber, milk, soybeans, strawberries, lentils, oats and walnuts.
You can also take a biotin supplement. However consult your doctor about this matter first.
Orange juice
Another remedy that can boost nail growth is orange juice. Its vitamin C content encourages the production of collagen and keeps your nails healthy. Also, it has folic acid, which is essential for nail growth.
Method: Soak your nails in fresh orange juice for at least 10 minutes. Rinse them off with warm water, pat dry and apply some moisturizer. Follow this remedy once daily until you are satisfied with the results.
Lemons
Lemons contain vitamin C that is essential for nail growth. Also, it helps treat yellow nails and gives your nails a nice shine.
Method: Prepare a nail soak with one tablespoon of lemon juice and three tablespoons of olive oil. Slightly heat the solution in the microwave and then soak your nails in it for 10 minutes. Follow this remedy daily.
You can also rub a slice of lemon on your nails for five minutes, then rinse them with warm water. Pat dry and apply a moisturizer. Do this once daily. Avoid rubbing lemon on your nails if you have any cuts or hangnails, as it may sting.

Coconut oil
Coconut oil works well for healthy nail growth. It contains important nutrients to keep your nails moisturized and strong. It also strengthens your cuticles, which play a key role in nail growth. Plus, it helps cure hangnails, cuticle infections and fungal nails.

Nations Trust Bank empowers Lankan expats
South Korea is home to a vibrant community of Sri Lankan expatriates striving to build a better future for their families in Sri Lanka by taking advantage of opportunities in major cities like Gimhae.
This results in a large volume of remittances from South Korea to Sri Lanka, which Nations Trust Bank facilitates through its agents. To support the Sri Lankan expatriate community in South Korea and to assist them in planning and building a better tomorrow, Nations Trust Bank is conducting an ongoing campaign to promote entrepreneurism and responsible financial decision making amongst this community.
The campaign had been conceived by the Remittances team of the Bank after a detailed on the ground stakeholder engagement conducted with expats and the embassy earlier this year.
The campaign, conducted under the theme Entrepreneurship: Winning Life, has already seen the launch of an informational booklet and a series of videos by the renowned Professor and Senior Lecturer of the Department of Accountancy  Faculty of Business Studies and Finance at the University of Wayamba, Dr. Aminda Methsila Perera. A series of seminars were held in the cities of Cheonan, Gimhae, Gimpo, Ulsan and Ansan with the participation of the corporate management of Nations Trust Bank, at which Sri Lankan expats could meet, learn and build relationships that would empower them to become successful entrepreneurs. More events, videos and publications are planned for the future.
Theja Silva, Group Company Secretary/General Counsel at Nations Trust Bank, heading its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives said, Sri Lankans living abroad have a lot to offer our country, with the knowledge, capital and networks they have established during their time abroad. If we can empower them early on to start thinking of setting-up businesses in Sri Lanka, while they are still abroad, there will be better opportunity recognition by these expats and their investments can help to diversify and improve our economic standards with transfer of technology and improved working methods. Such entrepreneurial investments by our expats will also create wider benefits for our society including more job opportunities and better choice of products in the market.
Speaking about the entrepreneurship empowerment campaign, Sheahan Daniel, Senior Vice President  Branch Network at Nations Trust Bank said, There is a heavy flow of foreign remittances to Sri Lanka from Sri Lankans living and working in South Korea, which is a country at the cutting edge of technological advancement. We are facilitating these remittances through our agents in that country and while our services are excellent, we felt that we could do more.Earning money alone isnt enough for a prosperous future and thus we felt the need to educate the Lankan expat community in South Korea on how they can maximize the wealth they are generating; how they can invest their money in Sri Lanka, start businesses of their own and have a proper support and infrastructure system in place for them and their families, particularly when they finally return to Sri Lanka. We are happy to be able to have a visionary like Dr. Aminda Methsila Perera onboard with us and look forward to continuing with the campaign. The videos and content we are creating not only benefit expats in South Korea, but have the potential to benefit Sri Lankan expats all over the world.
The release of the first series of advisory videos commenced on August 11, 2018. All were presented by Dr. Amila Methsila Perera and focused on topics such as Making your dreams come true, Difference between savings and investment, Managing expenses according to income, Registering a Business in Sri Lanka, Time value of money and How to accomplish your future goals.

PAINTING THE WOMAN'S SOUL
Innermost desires, awakened feelings, beastly hungers and dormant daydreams are what Dillai Joseph Rodrigos painting exhibition is all about. In her exhibition she depicts the womans soul in her barest form. Here she looks at the deep nature of the woman within, beyond a body of just flesh and skin.
Daily News speaks to Rodrigo who is donating all the proceeds of her exhibition to LEADS a child focused national NGO and charity that has been serving vulnerable communities in need in Sri Lanka for over 35 years.
LEADS is a child focused national NGO and charity that has been serving vulnerable communities in need in Sri Lanka for over 35 years. LEADS child protection division ESCAPE (Eradicating Sexual Child Abuse, Prostitution and Exploitation) was set up in 1995, to combat the increasing cases of child sexual abuse in the country.
ESCAPE also operates the only government approved residential care and therapy centers for child survivors of sexual abuse in Sri Lankas Northern and Western provinces. ESCAPEs work offers a range of services including therapy, counselling, family follow-up, legal aid, awareness and training as well as policy advocacy working with like-minded agencies to combat all forms of child abuse and make Sri Lanka a safer place for her children.
Rodrigo being a mother of two knows what it is to worry about her children as all mothers do. We all know how terrible and horrifying child abuse is, and the devastating impact it can have on the life of an innocent child. She wants to do her best, to make society a safe place for children to grow up in.
To begin with I have two small kids. I always think about my childrens safety. As a mother you always worry for your children. When children are abused, it has a lasting effect. As an adult your relationships and how you behave is governed by your childhood. This is why I feel for this cause.
There has been a sharp rise in Child abuse cases in the recent past. In Sri Lanka people push things under the carpet, they dont address it and there is no place for it to be addressed in the correct manner. There are very few places that provide such a service. Funding is badly needed to run Counselling centers, Residential therapeutic programs with qualified psychologists, house parents, family follow up officers to coordinate medical and legal needs of the child, said Rodrigo.
Rodrigo is undoubtedly talented and she wants to use that talent and gift of painting to make a difference in society. She wants to use that talent to do her part in making society a place where children can grow up as children should grow up. Where children can realize their potential and enjoy life the way they should enjoy life.
Upcoming exhibition Soulscapes, explores more than just the human form in its theme  It is an artistic exploration of the human soul where I particularly depict the womans soul in her barest form. The innermost desires, awakened feelings, beastly hungers and dormant daydreams find their place on canvas in my portrayal of the I within every woman. My work speaks of an aim to provoke a sense of exploration of oneself; I look at the deep nature of the woman within, beyond a body of just flesh and skin. My paintings in general try to portray as much nature and connect it to humans as much possible. Interestingly, I use a lot of trees, as source of security and companionship. My first solo exhibition was titled People, Puddles and Paradise, explained Rodrigo.
Peoples lives and nature inspires her to paint. She points out that their inner feelings and how they connect to the rest of the world gives her enough subject matter. In her words - Everything that surrounds me. There is no one person or thing.
When it comes to painting, I feel its my way of expressing my feelings and thoughts, and I use this as a medium. I would say it comes from within. I want to share my work. This times theme concentrates on celebrating the woman and her deep nature. I admire the painting styles of Caravaggio and Picassos early days, points out Rodrigo.
Thanks from Rodrigo goes out to her teacher Nadine David for having faith in her work and guidance with technique, and her parents for being open minded. She also would like to thank her husband and kids for being her greatest fans and critics.
I want to continue to paint. Better myself with technique and continue learning different skills. I want to explore different subject matter that drives human behavior. I also want to be part of projects such as this, to see how I can use my skill to better peoples lives. To me, I will want to use my creativity in whatever form to make something original and close to the heart, added Rodrigo.
Rodrigo comes from a family that gave her the freedom to explore. She was never inhibited by anything and her talent was given free reign. It was an environment that was very conducive to the development of her gift of painting.
I come from a family that nurtures creativity. From my younger days I have been painting and experimenting with colors and techniques. My grandfather spent quite a bit of time with me on object drawing. I learnt how to observe things and draw from it even as a kid. I consider painting to be my calling in life and I consider it to be like another child of mine. I am in advertising. Thats my job. But I am very much into music and singing, added Rodrigo.
The exhibition will feature up to 30 exhibits drawn on Acrylic on Canvas, Dry Pastel on paper. October 5 is the exclusive preview and October 6 and 7 will be for the public at the Lionel Wendt.

Sugar in Ceylon Tea
New laws to bring culprits to book: Gayantha
The government had realised the gravity of the situation where tea exporters were tarnishing Ceylon Tea's reputation and hence, the Plantations Minister was implementing new laws to punish those who were engaged in such malpractices, Chief Government Whip Gayantha Karunatillake said.
He was addressing Parliament, yesterday, in response to a question raised by MP Dayasiri Jayasekara.
MP Jayasekara questioned whether dyes, sugar or other flavours were added while drying and processing tea, and what measures had been taken to charge those who were engaged in such practices.
Adding sugar to tea is a significant problem affecting the quality of our tea and around 53 tea factories were found to be engaged in this practice during a raid conducted last year. However, this had not been discontinued and due to that, it is the tea smallholders who suffer, he said.
Jayasekara said that little action had been taken against errant factory employees; the matter was being looked into by a mediation board and the perpetrators were getting off scot-free. MP Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said that sugar and ferrous phosphate were being added to darken the colour of tea. Although raids were conducted to arrest errant factory workers through an initiative taken by the former Tea Board Chairman, there was no mechanism to punish the offenders.
These factories earn millions; they can afford good lawyers. They find loopholes in the law to elude penalties. Hence, it is vital that we establish proper laws to punish such culprits, he added.
Minister Gayantha Karunatillake said that the situation had affected genuine tea factories and was a major crisis faced by Sri Lanka's tea industry.
If found guilty, registrations of factories the culprits are employed at would be temporarily suspended, and they would have to pay mediation board charges. In addition, with the powers vested in the tea commissioner, legal measures could be taken against the offenders. However, better laws are required to perfect the process, he said.
MP Dayasiri Jayasekara said there were 600 tea factories in the country and of them, 53 were detected to have employees guilty of misconduct during last February's raids.
Plantation Minister Navin Dissanayake assured that stern action would be taken, but nothing had been done. Further, the tea board chairman who initiated the raids had been replaced, he added.
He asked as to when the government would take action against the wrongdoers. State Plantation Industries Minister A.D. Premadasa said that 288.9 million metric tonnes of tea had been exported last year to 131 countries, including Iraq, Turkey, Iran and Russia. He said measures had been taken to ensure that the quality of the tea conformed to ISO 3720 standards, adding that 4,000 samples were tested, and sub-standard tea was removed.
Tea prepared for export is tested at various stages before it is shipped. This process is monitored by the Sri Lanka Tea Board, he added.

Better housing facilities forestate workers:Kiriella
The government was constructing houses for estate workers in seven-perch lands, Public Enterprise Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister, taking part in the second reading debate on the New Villages Development Authority for Plantation Region Bill in Parliament, yesterday, said that no previous government had granted ownership of lands to estate workers.
Moving the bill for debate, Hill Country, New Villages, Infrastructure and Community Development Minister P. Digambaran said the construction of houses in seven-perch lands could be expedited when the new authority to develop villages in the plantation region was established.
The new villages would replace the existing shanties in estates with new houses and improve the basic infrastructure facilities within them. The new authority would be responsible for coordinating the development projects in plantation regions.
The government, with this move, aims to include the plantation community into the social mainstream through socioeconomic, cultural and infrastructure development.
The new authority would work hand in hand with other national, provincial, and district-level agencies in the plantation region. The bill was unanimously passed in Parliament.

Chief Minister faces embezzlement allegations
Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake had allegedly deposited Rs.3.5 million collected to purchase schoolbags for pre-school children, into his personal bank account, Parliament was told yesterday.
The sum should have been deposited in the provincial council's official bank account. Deputy Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Sriyani Wijewickrama said that the chief minister had allegedly obtained the money from state banks.
She was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri.
The audit inquiry in this regard, had stated that such funds should be maintained by the official accounts of the provincial council, and that the councils approval was needed when such funds were spent.
The funds had been deposited to an account under the name 'Chamara Sampath Foundation'.
Deputy Minister Wijewickrama alleging that there had been a misappropriation of funds, said that anyone could go to courts and complain against the act.

Sanctions imposed on Iran
Special committee to resolvepayment issues: Navin
It had been decided to appoint a special committee to resolve the payment issues related to Iran in the face of sanctions imposed on it by the USA, Plantations Minister Navin Dissanayake said in Parliament, yesterday.
The decision was made during Tuesday's Cabinet meeting, he added.
He was responding to a statement made by MP Lakshman Yapa Abewardena that the tea industry was dwindling, and that 38 tea factories had been closed due to the decline in tea quality. Last year, tea production stood at 307 million metric tonnes, and we expect to increase it to 330 million tonnes. The process is being carried out systematically, however, some factories have been closed due to administrative discrepancies,  Minister Dissanayake said.
The price of tea has declined, but that is due to America imposing sanctions on Iran and Turkey. When Cabinet met on Tuesday, we decided to appoint a committee to resolve the payment issues with regard to Iran, he added.
JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said that the Foreign Ministry had issued a gazette notification outlining a large number of sanctions against Iran, which had been approved. He asked Minister Dissanayake whether those sanctions would have an impact on his ministry.
This gazette was tabled in Parliament during the previous session and it was based on the sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States, MP Rathnayake added. However, Minister Navin Dissanayake denied any knowledge of the gazette notification.

A hint of this came from President Maithripala Sirisena himself a few days ago when he declared at a public event in Nivithigala that the presidential election, due in January 2020 will not be held even one day earlier.
Some have suggested that the President may have learnt a lesson from his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa who called for an early presidential election in January 2015, with almost two years of his second term of office left, only to be defeated by a convincing margin by President Sirisena.
Of course, President Sirisena is yet to formally declare his candidacy for the election from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). For that matter, none of those who have been speculated upon as potential candidates- including Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe from the United National Party (UNP) and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)- have officially declared themselves as candidates. Each of them has their own dilemmas to contend with.
For President Sirisena, offering himself as a candidate would mean that he would be reneging on a pledge that he gave in 2015 that he would not run for the office of President again. It is a promise that he had repeated on several occasions, even after being elected President.
SLPP and the Rajapaksas
However, the President could also argue that the political circumstances have changed considerably since then. At the time he made his pledge to the people, the political equation in the country comprised of two major parties, the SLFP and the UNP, jostling with each other for power.
Now however, that has changed. Mahinda Rajapaksa has returned to the political arena and the SLPP has emerged as a viable alternative, as evidenced at the local government elections earlier this year. The President could argue before the electorate that his leadership- and therefore his candidacy at the presidential election- was a sine qua non to save the SLFP from being taken over by the SLPP and the Rajapaksas.
There is also another aspect that President Sirisena is mindful of. This is the possibility running a joint ticket with the Rajapaksa camp, where he would run for President and Rajapaksa would be Prime Minister in a government that would then be formed, either before or after a general election.
It is well known that former General Secretary of the SLFP, S. B. Dissanayake is trying his best to broker such a plan, even if some factions within the SLPP and the SLFP are not in favour of this strategy. It is also unthinkable that Dissanayakes initiative does not have the blessings of President Sirisena.
Those who believe in the joint ticket concept argue that it would be a win-win situation for both President Sirisena and Rajapaksa. They contend that President Sirisena- who won the previous election with the unstinted support of the UNP- would be assured of victory if the SLPP supports him, along with the mainstream SLFP.
Barred from contesting a third time
It has been noted that President Sirisena, in his speech at Nivithigala made an interesting observation. He said that, at the next elections the public should be concerned more about who the Prime Minister would be rather than who the President would be, because the former would be more powerful. Promoters of the joint ticket idea claim that this could be a thinly disguised invitation to the Rajapaksa camp.
They also point out that Rajapaksas woes in finding a suitable presidential candidate would be solved automatically with a joint ticket. At present, that has become a complex task because Rajapaksa is constitutionally barred from contesting a third time and the other prospective candidate, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, has a plethora of allegations to answer in court in addition to being a citizen of the United States.
In this regard, Rajapaksa, perhaps in a moment of weakness, let the cat out of the bag during a recent visit to India. In an interview with a leading Indian newspaper, he was asked about potential presidential candidates. He prefaced his answer stating that the age limit for presidential candidates had been increased from 30 years to 35 years and therefore, Namal Rajapaksa could not contest.
The import of what Rajapaksa said has not been lost on others in the SLPP and even within family circles. Rajapaksas comments seemed to suggest that, had Namal Rajapaksa been eligible, he would have been the first choice to be the SLPPs candidate.
Namal Rajapaksa, now 32 years of age, has been in Parliament for eight years as a backbench parliamentarian. He has never held ministerial or deputy ministerial rank. His only realistic claim to fame is being his fathers son and carrying the Rajapaksa name tag.
Critics have also noted that Namal Rajapaksa accompanied his father on the visit to India and was in attendance during meetings with Indian leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi. That he is being groomed to be a successor to Mahinda Rajapaksa has now become obvious.
How Namal Rajapaksa is even being thought of as a presidential candidate has baffled the second-tier leadership of the SLPP, when there are more senior leaders who have toiled for decades in the opposition and have years of experience in the rough and tumble of politics. For instance, Dinesh Gunawardena is a glaring example.
This has raised the spectre of nepotism among the Rajapaksas once again. Worse still, now the allegation is that while Rajapaksas are given pride of place within the SLPP, Mahinda Rajapaksas immediate family appears to be treated as first among equals even within the Rajapaksa clan.
Meanwhile, the UNP is comparatively unperturbed about presidential candidates. There appears to be general agreement that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should run as its candidate. Wickremesinghe has contested twice and was unlucky on both occasions. In 1999, a bomb blast at Chandrika Kumaratungas last election rally handed her the sympathy vote. In 2005, an enforced boycott of the vote in the North and East ensured Mahinda Rajapaksas victory.
UNPers point out that, by the time elections are held in 2020, the party would not have contested presidential elections in fifteen years because it endorsed so-called common candidates, Sarath Fonseka in 2010 and Maithripala Sirisena in 2015. It is not an achievement a major political party should be proud of, even if it was successful in 2015.
Issues about potential presidential candidates have become even more convoluted with claims of an assassination plot against President Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa being made by an individual.
A full-scale inquiry is underway into the allegations and the senior Police officer at the centre of the controversy, Deputy Inspector General in charge of the Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) Nalaka de Silva has been temporarily transferred pending further investigations.
It is clear that the major political parties are gearing themselves to do battle at the presidential stakes in 2020 and are grappling with internal divisions and deliberating desperately about putting their best candidate forward. If anything, recent presidential elections, both in 2010 and 2015 have thrown up unexpected candidates at the eleventh hour- and there is every possibility that history will repeat itself, come 2020.

Rohithas undeclared assets case trial on October 19
A corruption case filed against former minister and Kalutara District MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena for unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million was yesterday fixed for trial on October 19 by the Colombo High Court.
Filing a motion before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, defence counsel Hemantha Gamage moved court that the trial date that had been fixed for trial earlier (October 4) be adjusted to another date since his client is expecting to travel abroad.
Accordingly, Abeygunawardena was permitted to travel to Norway and Italy between September 30 and October 16.
At an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled preliminary objections raised by the former minister against the Bribery Commissions decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director General had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act. The Director General further alleged that former Minister Abeygunawardena had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.
Senior State Counsel Sudarshana de Silva appeared for the Bribery Commission.
Counsel Hemantha Gamage with Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.

A salutary move
Teachers in government schools are in for a bright, and, prosperous New Year. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has announced a hefty salary increase for the 250,000 teachers islandwide from the beginning of next year. A committee has already been appointed to look into the matter of increasing efficiency among teachers. A meeting was also held by the minister with education sector trade union representatives and he requested them to submit proposals to the committee. I admit that teachers draw one of the lowest salaries in the public service. They also have salary anomalies and their pay has not been revised for several years. My intention is to give them a respectable salary. I hope we will be able to increase the efficiency and productivity of the teachers by introducing these reforms to the education sector, the minister was quoted as saying in media reports.
If there is a segment in the public sector who deserve a salary increase more than any other, it is the countrys teaching population. In them lay the responsibility of moulding the countrys future generation, not only in imparting knowledge but also in the area of character building and in the creation of a rounded individual who will not be a misfit in society. Hence, theirs is an onerous task albeit for little reward. They do not have the luxury of engaging in strikes like our doctors in the GMOA. Nor do they stage street protests or satyagrahas to draw attention to their plight. Like the minister himself conceded teachers are among the most poorly paid in the Government service.
Hence it is commendable that the minister has taken positive steps to redress this anomaly. We say this because recently the salaries and allowances of University dons were increased to appreciable levels. However, the teachers were overlooked. While admitting that the top academics in the Universities number only a few compared to the teacher population one is inclined to feel that an injustice may have been committed. Our teachers deserve all the recognition accorded to doctors and members of other professions. Like them, the teachers too are looked up to by society for the noble profession they are engaged in. In the good old days, it is to the loku iskolay mahattaya (school principal) that the villagers traditionally went for counsel. Also it is the self same iskolay mahahattaya that the rural folk sought to feed the first mouthful of rice (indul kata gema) to their young children. Though this custom may be on the wane in this modern day and age the respect and regard for our teachers still remain intact.
Hence, the need for the Government to appreciate their role and treat them with due honour. Their salaries should be taken up for review with the same frequency that the Government does for the salaries of doctors, nurses and engine drivers et al, particularly given the high living costs of the present day. Teacher transfers too should be properly streamlined to ensure no injustice is done, and, more importantly, to obviate the need for going behind politicians for the purpose. They also should be made entitled to all the concessionary facilities offered by the government to all public servants, such as housing loans and insurance. Steps should also be taken to improve the conditions in rural schools, most of which lack teachers and basic facilities. It goes without saying the teachers should be provided with a conducive environment for more productivity. It is natural therefore for the teachers to shun schools in remote areas for want of proper facilities. Some of the schools, especially in the estate areas, have no water and toilet facilities, as often reported in the media. While improving the lot of the teachers, measures should also be taken to develop infrastructure in rural schools.
Allegations of mismanagement in some of the more prestigious schools, highlighted in the media, should also engage the ministers attention. Most of these charges are directed at the school principals and involve embezzlement of funds and malpractices in school admissions. Needless to say, these only go to sully the reputation of the schools concerned and more importantly, casts a slur on the teaching profession as a whole. It was once claimed by a Minister of Sports in the Rajapaksa Government that the highest number of malpractices were observed in the Education sector followed by the Police and the Cricket Board.
Now that the minister has introduced salary reforms, delivering the teachers out of the raw deal they had been receiving all these years, the teachers should redouble their efforts to serve the student population with extra vigour and efficiency. There had been complaints, with justification, that present days teachers are lacking in enthusiasm in the classroom, chiefly with an eye on private tuition which today has become a booming industry and a money-spinner. They should forgo the practice, if they could help it, and pay more attention to their charges in the classrooms, lest they be bracketed with the Government doctors who similarly make only casual inspections of patients who come to them, to rush forth to their high paying private practice centres.

Sivagurunathan Memorial Trophy cricket to bridge Jaffna and Colombo
The Jaffna and Colombo communities have been tied in a ceremonial bond through a celebrated cricket tournament between Hindu College, Jaffna and Ananda College, Colombo. Iconic personalities of the Hindu and Buddhist communities in Sri Lanka will be played for the Sivagurunathan Memorial Trophy tourney.
The programme will be organized by Ananda College Old Boys Association and the event will be worked off on September 28 and 29. In addition to the cricket encounter, an English debate contest for the Panikkar-Thanabalasingham Trophy, in memory of two illustrious teachers who excelled in teaching and encouraged English at Ananda will also be held. A basketball match and chess tournament will also be worked off.
The objective behind the entire programme is to create an opportunity for students, staff and parents to transcend the physical and mental barriers that had been built up over the last few decades and eventually to set an example for inter communal harmony.
The contest is for the Sivagurunathan Trophy, in memory of V.T.S. Sivagurunathan, a JHC alumnus who was a stalwart during Anandas formative years. He served at Ananda from 1916 to 1942 as the headmaster and much more during the period of Principal P de S Kularatne. He was a man of great energy and versatility. Whilst doing a full programme of classroom teaching, he drew up the time-tables, supervised production of the college magazine and was an archivist and chronicler who maintained cumulative records of pupils long before the Department of Education did. He also wrote a series of books for the teaching of English to beginners, which were widely used outside Ananda even.
Sivagurunathan openly advocated a liberal, national outlook and found the Ananda College to embody this vision. He was a truly national-minded educationists and worked for harmony among distant cultures. His struggle was to provide opportunities to those who were excluded from receiving a modern education during the Colonial period due to religious or economic considerations.

SLPP should give up slavery mentality - Deputy Minister
Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said yesterday that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) has become a party of Rajapaksas slaves today.
We urge the SLPP members to give up this slavery mentality and put forward a candidate who can compete with us and who will be accepted by all in the party, he added.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has said since his son is not yet 35 years old, he will try to nominate one of his brothers as the next Presidential candidate.
We wonder whether there is no one else in the Pohottuwa party other than Namal Rajapaksa, he added.
So far this year the government had released Rs.2,104 million to provide drought relief for the people, the Minister said.
In addition, the government had also provided 11,000 water tanks which cost about Rs.91 million together with 407 water bowsers, he added.

## Title: South Asia has fastest HDI growth in developing regions
## Supertitle: UNDP report:
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, September 20, 2018 - 01:00
UNDP report:
South Asia has fastest HDI growth in developing regions
Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland and Germany lead the ranking of 189 countries and territories in the latest Human Development Index (HDI), while Niger, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores in the HDIs measurement of national achievements in health, education and income, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) said in a release last week.
The overall trend globally is toward continued human development improvements, with many countries moving up through the human development categories: out of the 189 countries for which the HDI is calculated, 59 countries are today in the very high human development group and only 38 countries fall in the low HDI group. Just eight years ago in 2010, the figures were 46 and 49 countries respectively.
Ireland enjoyed the highest increase in HDI rank between 2012 and 2017 moving up 13 places, while Turkey, the Dominican Republic and Botswana were also developing strongly, each moving up eight places. All three steepest declines in human development ranking were countries in conflict: the Syrian Arab Republic had the largest decrease in HDI rank, falling 27 places, followed by Libya (26 places), and Yemen (20 places).
Movements in the HDI are driven by changes in health, education and income. Health has improved considerably as shown by life expectancy at birth which has increased by almost seven years globally, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia showing the greatest progress, each experiencing increases of about 11 years since 1990. And, todays school-age children can expect to be in school for 3.4 years longer than those in 1990.
Disparities between and within countries
Average HDI levels have risen significantly since 1990  22 percent globally and 51 percent in least developed countries  reflecting that on average people are living longer, are more educated and have greater income. But there remain massive differences across the world in peoples well-being.
A child born today in Norway, the country with the highest HDI, can expect to live beyond 82 years old and spend almost 18 years in school. While a child born in Niger, the country with the lowest HDI, can expect only to live to 60 and spend just five years in school. Such striking differences can be seen again and again.
On average, a child born today in a country with low human development can expect to live just over 60 years, while a child born in a country with very high human development can expect to live to almost 80. Similarly, children in low human development countries can expect to be in school seven years less than children in very high human development countries, said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. While these statistics present a stark picture in themselves, they also speak to the tragedy of millions of individuals whose lives are affected by inequity and lost opportunities, neither of which is inevitable.
A closer look at the HDIs components sheds light on the unequal distribution of outcomes in education, life expectancy and income within countries. The Inequality-Adjusted Human Development Index allows one to compare levels of inequality within countries, and the greater the inequality, the more a countrys HDI falls.
While significant inequality occurs in many countries, including in some of the wealthiest ones, on average it takes a bigger toll on countries with lower human development levels. Low and medium human development countries lose respectively 31 and 25 percent of their human development level from inequality, while for very high human development countries, the average loss is 11 percent.
While there is ground for optimism that the gaps are narrowing, disparities in peoples well-being are still unacceptably wide. Inequality in all its forms and dimensions, between and within countries, limits peoples choices and opportunities, withholding progress, said UNDPs Director of the Human Development Report Office, Selim Jahan.
Gender gaps in early years are closing
One key source of inequality within countries is the gap in opportunities, achievements and empowerment between women and men. Worldwide, the average HDI for women is six percent lower than for men, due to womens lower income and educational attainment in many countries.
Although there has been laudable progress in the number of girls attending school, there remain big differences between other key aspects of men and womens lives. Womens empowerment remains a particular challenge.
Global labour force participation rates for women are lower than for men  49 percent versus 75 percent. And when women are in the labour market, their unemployment rates are 24 percent higher than their male counterparts. Women globally also do much more unpaid domestic and care work than men.
Overall, womens share of parliamentary seats remains low although it varies across regions, from 17.5 and 18 percent in South Asia and the Arab States, respectively, to 29 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean and OECD countries. Violence against women affects all societies, and in some regions, childhood marriage and high adolescence birth rates undermine the opportunities for many young women and girls. In South Asia, 29 percent of women between the ages of 20 and 24 were married before their 18th birthday.
High adolescent birth rates, early motherhood, and poor and unequal access to pre- and post-natal health services result in a high maternal mortality ratio. At 101 per 1,000 live births, Sub-Saharan Africas adolescent birth rate is more than twice the world average of 44 per 1,000 live births. Latin America and the Caribbean follows with 62 per 1,000 live births. Even though Sub-Saharan Africas maternal mortality ratio is 549 deaths per 100,000 live births, some countries in the region such as Cabo Verde have achieved a much lower rate (42 deaths per 100,000 live births).
Looking beyond HDI
There is tremendous variation between countries in the quality of education, healthcare and many other key aspects of life.
In Sub-Saharan Africa there are on average 39 primary school pupils per teacher, followed by South Asia with 35 pupils per teacher. But in OECD countries, East Asia and the Pacific, and Europe and Central Asia, there is an average of one teacher for every 16-18 primary school pupils.
And, while in OECD countries and East Asia and the Pacific there are on average 29 and 28 physicians for every 10,000 people respectively, in South Asia there are only eight, and in Sub-Saharan Africa not even two.
Much of the worlds attention is on data that tells only a part of the story about peoples lives. For instance, it is increasingly clear that it is not enough simply to count how many children are in school: we need also to know whether they are learning anything. Focusing on quality is essential to foster sustainable and sustained human development progress, concludes Jahan. (UNDP)
[Key regional development trends]
Key regional development trends, as shown by the HDI and other human development indices:
Arab states: The region has seen a 25.5 percent increase in its HDI value since 1990. The Arab States lose 25 percent of overall HDI value when adjusted for inequalities.
The region also has the second-largest gender gap across all developing regions measured by the Gender Development Index (GDI) (14.5 percent gap between men and women in the HDI). Womens labour force participation rate is the lowest among developing regions at 21 percent.
East Asia and the Pacific: The region registered the second-highest growth in HDI at 41.8 percent between 1990 and 2017.
However, when adjusted for inequality, it experienced a 15.6 percent loss in HDI. While the gender gap between men and women in HDI is 4.3 percent, below the global average of six percent, womens share of parliamentary seats remains one of the lowest among developing regions at 19.8 percent, compared to the global average of 23.5 percent.
Europe and Central Asia: The region has an average HDI value of 0.771  the highest among the developing regions. The region also shows the lowest overall loss in HDI due to inequality at 11.7 percent, similar to the rate of OECD countries (11.9 percent). And it registers the lowest inequality between men and women among the developing regions as measured by the GII. However, the labour force participation rate for women is still much lower than for men (45.5 versus 70.3 percent), and women only hold 20.7 of the seats in parliament.
Latin America and the Caribbean: Latin America and the Caribbean enjoy high levels of human development, second only to Europe and Central Asia. However, when adjusted for inequality, the regions HDI drops by 21.8 percent due to the unequal distribution of human development, particularly in income. The region has the narrowest gap between men and women in HDI at two percent, below the global average of six percent. However, it has the second highest adolescent birth rate and the labour force participation rate for women is significantly lower than for men (51.6 vs 77.5 percent).
South Asia: South Asia experienced the fastest HDI growth among developing regions with a 45.3 percent increase since 1990. During that period, life expectancy grew by 10.8 years, as did expected years of schooling for children (by 21 percent). The loss in HDI due to inequalities is about 26 percent. South Asia has the widest gap between men and women in HDI at 16.3 percent.
Sub-Saharan Africa: The region has seen a 35 percent growth in HDI since 1990. Twelve countries in the region are now in the medium human development group, and four countries  Botswana, Gabon, Mauritius and Seychelles  are now in the high human development group. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest regional loss due to inequality (31 percent). Rwanda has the largest share of seats in parliament in the world held by women (55.7 percent). (UNDP)

The General Elections will soon follow and the Minister, and this government will reap the repercussions for their fiddling and in-action.
When the masses of this country look at the choices before them you do not know whether you ought to be laughing or crying. Just mull on the catalogue of boo-boos listed below.
BOO-BOO NO. 1: Where else in the world will a government with a Minister in charge of sports allow the Chairman of the Natinal Selection Committee to carry out match referee duties for the ICC in the on-going Womens WC qualifiers while our national cricket team was being roasted by minnows in world cricket. Can such important key positions of state be devalued to a point while the Minister in charge turns a blind eye
BOO-BOO NO. 2: Sri Lanka is perhaps the only country in the world where team selections are encompassed under a Sports Law through an Act of Parliament. Such legislation was primarily introduced during the 1970s by far thinking respected parliamentarians of that era to ensure there was a level playing field across the sports circuit. One critical factor embodied in this piece of legislation is the independence of the selection process across all 60+ disciplines in existence today. There are clear guidelines on what processes need to be followed and what responsibilities are vested in the National Selection Committee of each sporting discipline.
Cricket is the only sport that allows the coach to be an official member of the National Selection Committee in clear violation of the Sports Law. Can the Minster of Sports who himself is a legal luminary continue to ignore such violation of the laws of the land as a member of a responsible cabinet that has taken oaths to respect and uphold the laws of the land
BOO-BOO NO. 3: It is becoming blatantly clear by the day that the support staff hired by the former Ex-Co of SLC headed by Sumathipala to take them to 2019 WC glory is devoid of skill and credentials. The personnel were bandied around with press conferences and the lot when first hired creating an aura of unassailability. Sadly, a few months down the road the pistons have failed to fire, and the inadequacies have been exposed. There is also visible evidence to suggest that this coaching team is meddling too much with the techniques of our free scoring batsmen and ruining their careers in the process. In such a scenario, the choice before the Minister is simple. He may allow this bus to trundle along from pitfall to pitfall until it hits a wall at the WC 2019 or wipe the slate clean by bringing in meaningful changes and resuscitate the campaign for WC 2019.
BOO-BOO NO. 4: The appointment of a Competent Authority instead of an Interim Committee of knowledgeable emissaries. The knee jerk decision making, the lunacy of arranging T20 tournaments before an ODI series, attempts of fraud all point towards the incompetence and ineptitude of the people in charge. It is futile for anybody in his right mind to expect the cricket to be administered efficiently under such an environment. The Minister can choose to change this situation overnight by appointing an interim (or management) committee as recommended by the ICC as well.
The direction and the road map ahead cannot get simpler and clearer than this. The country waits with bated breath watching if the Minister will continue to fiddle while Rome burns, or carries out his ministerial responsibilities upholding the pledges and obligations vested in him as a peoples representative.

Sri Lanka handicrafts exports up 11%
Despite the South Asian giants renowned arts and craft traditions of millennia, India cannot hold back its love for Sri Lankan handicrafts.
Sri Lanka, like India has a tradition of handicrafts. The handicrafts in both our nations continue for millennia. Sri Lankan art creations are very popular with Indians said High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu on September 12 in Colombo.
According to the Sri Lanka Export Development Board, export of crafts increased last year by 11% to US$ 61 million from 2016s $56 million. The largest craft volumes were toys, ceramic ornaments and copper designs.
High Commissioner Sandhu was addressing the launch of Sri Lankas national Handicrafts Festival 2018 on September 12 at BMICH organised by the National Crafts Council (NCC) and joined by the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen, Agricultural Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Buddika Pathirana, Chairperson of NCC Heshani Bogollagama and many other distinguished craftsmen from Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Malaysia.
NCCs six-day long Shilpa Abhimani festival showcases 1418 designs (of Lankan craftsmen that won awards at Provincial levels) that will compete for Presidential Awards later.
Sri Lanka, like India has a tradition of handicrafts. The handicrafts in both our nations continue for millennia. Cave Paintings in Sigiriya, Dambulla, and wood carvings in Lankathilaka Temple, speaks of exceptional skills of master-craftsmen of yesteryear. You will agree with me that the wooden masks have become synonymous with Brand Sri Lanka. The history of Indian handicrafts go back to almost 5,000 years, said High Commissioner Sandhu, and added, There are numerous handicrafts from Indus Valley civilisation in Indian handicrafts (sector) which have become popular. Each handicraft leaves a legacy.
The Surajkund International Crafts Festival in Faridabad (Haryana State) in India, is the countrys Minister Bathiudeen stressed of the achievements of NCC. With the Japan based International Research Centre for Intangible Cultural Heritage in the Asia-Pacific Region (IRCI) the government is now working on a project to revive traditional textiles and womens handicrafts in North and Eastern Provinces.
We thank both UNESCO and IRCI for supporting us in this project which is expected to close in 2019. With the EDB the NCC will conduct a special workshop on exporting process for nearly 100 Master Craftsmen. There are 26,000 Sri Lankan craftsmen. Training them and taking their crafts to the market are important activities. We expanded our training centres and now we have a total of 112 centres across the country she said.

Taking JUMBO strides!
Anya de Saram-Larssen was never afraid of BIG things. As a child she used to follow her grandmother into the wilderness, hunting for flora and fauna. Their outdoor ventures inspired the young lass and kindled her passion for nature and conservation.
British School in Colombo PrincipalDr John Scarth
She was extremely fond of nature and would stress on the fact that it needs to be protected. I was motivated by her words and began to engage in projects related to wildlife and environment conservation, Anya explained.
The 13 year old student of the British School in Colombo was recently named among 19 young activists who are recipients of 2018 International Young Eco-Hero Awards for their impactful environmental projects addressing climate change, energy conservation, wildlife protection, landfill waste, and water pollution. The recipients are selected by the San Francisco-based nonprofit Action for Nature for their creative projects aimed at solving the worlds environmental problems. They range from 8 to 16 years and come from countries like the USA, Australia, Canada, Columbia, Peru, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates. Anya was the only South Asian among the awardees.

Interior of the EleBus
Going on a safari to Wasgamuwa National ParkIdentifying birds
Taking an elephantine leap and getting herself involved the awareness and prevention of the human-elephant conflict happened by chance with a random Google search. Anya had come across the project initiated by the Sri Lanka Wildlife Conservation Society (SLWCS) to raise funds for an elefriendly bus to transport school children in Wasgamuwa.
I was really taken by their work and wanted to do my bit to help them to turn their vision into a reality. I organized a Bake Sale at my school and gave all the proceeds to the project, she recalled with a note of enthusiasm.
The bus is now on the road, running its routine through a zone which has once been noted as an area in which many human-elephant conflicts have occurred. Since the introduction of the Elephant-friendly Bus aka EleBus, the number of incidents reported have taken a nose dive.
It is especially designed to take school children to and from school. However grownups too travel to work on it. There are many slogans written in the interior of the bus advising its travels about the human-elephant conflict, Anya said.
Speaking about some of the facts she learnt while being involved in the project Anya says that one needs to keep calm if they see an elephant emerging. If there is a frenzy, it will excite the beast and provoke it to take action.
Taking one step further the half-Norwegian, half Sri Lankan youth organized a conservation camp in Wasgamuwa together with SLWCS. Not only did it manage to get youth involved in conservation work, it was also the first of its kind to be held in around a decade.
Unfurling her thoughts about the camp Anya says that she and a group of six school children from different schools learnt all the field techniques. They also had firsthand experience on learning why it is important to protect nature. The camp was a week long and the youth were able to interact with researchers and activists as well and gleaned many facts about conservation in terms of other species.
She had applied for the Young Eco Award because she wished to raise more awareness about the human-elephant conflict. She was interviewed and later selected for the honourable mention for her project Youth Against Human-Elephant Conflict in the 13 to 16 age group.
I believe that it is vital for the future generation to know about the issues in our surroundings. Since man has done a lot of damage to mother nature, the time has come for youth to help rebuild it and save it for the next generations. Winning the award has helped me realize that there is much more that I could do because others who have won it engage in work that are different from mine. I am also glad that a spotlight had fallen on the conservation work done in Sri Lanka, Anya said adding that more camps need to be held so that youth will be able to learn more about the wonders of nature through interaction.
Speaking about Anyas achievement the Principal of British School in Colombo Dr John Scarth said that the teenager is an example to other youth. He said that she had emerged a winner through her efforts and had proven that no dream is too big to achieve.
We are happy to be a part of her triumph and we motivate many more students to join hands for such worthy causes, he said.
Anya is gearing up for her next venture: raising funds for a research vessel to conduct research on the water for SLWCS. They hope to find out about the impact of climate change on aquatic flora and fauna with the equipment. Her ambition is to become an astrobiologist.
That profession too is related to wildlife since it is finding about life on another planet, she concluded with a smile.

Tokyo Cement partners with NAITA
A far-reaching MoU was signed between Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC and the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) with the objective of enhancing professional competence of construction craftsmen, the life blood in our national development, by giving them the opportunity to obtain National Vocational Qualification, (NVQ).
The MoU will see the two organizations join forces to upgrade skills of masonry craftsmen with professional and industry knowledge by providing them training and certification facilities at Tokyo Cements A.Y.S. Gnanam Construction Training Academy in Dambulla, under the expert guidance and supervision of NAITA.
The agreement was entered in to between Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma, Chairman of the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority and Dr. Harsha Cabral PC., Chairman of Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC at a recently held ceremony at the NAITA Head Office in Rajagiriya. Directors, along with Deputy and Assistant Directors of all Divisions of NAITA were present at this event, signifying their strategic engagement in driving this agreement to fruition.

Janaka Perera, General Manager, TOKYO SUPERMIX and Dashantha Udawatte, Group Marketing Manager were also present at the event.
NAITA is dynamically involved at District Level in every part of the country, by offering training opportunities to encourage youth and professionals to obtain a recognized qualification in a variety of fields of employment. Tokyo Cement Group on the other hand, has been providing a yeoman service to the construction Industry by conducting training programmes for masons across the county, since the year 1997.
Furthermore, an ultra-modern Training Institute was established in Dambulla in 2012, in memory of the Founder Chairman of Tokyo Cement Company, late Deshamanya A.Y.S. Gnanam, which facilitates formal masonry training for school leavers.
The A.Y.S. Gnanam Construction Training Academy, accredited by the Tertiary & Vocational Education Commission, can accommodate 50 residential trainees and comprises of a fully-fledged auditorium, and practical training facilities, inclusive of all necessary tools and building material required to conduct comprehensive training sessions.
Annually over 200 masons obtain their professional qualification at the institute and become active participants of nation building, while some of them bring in valuable foreign exchange through skilled employment in other countries.
The two organizations have been close collaborators for many years in facilitating professional training in the field of construction, and with this new understanding will improve the impact of the programme by reaching out to all parts of the country via the NAITA District Office network. Mouly Gunarathna, Consultant Engineer of Tokyo Cement Group, the driving force behind all training and development activities undertaken by the A.Y.S. Gnanam Construction Training Academy, worked closely with J.C.K. Basnayake, Director General of NAITA to formalize this longstanding partnership between the two organizations, in order to bring more value to masons who wish to uplift their professional standing with a globally recognized NVQ certification.
Dr. Saranga Alahapperuma, Chairman of NAITA, expressing his views during the MoU signing, highlighted the importance of strategic public-private partnerships such as this to bring in new energy to the efforts of the Government to improve our national skill pool.
NAITA is selective on forming partnerships that impact its reputation, consistently built and upheld over the years as a comprehensive training institute, recognized locally and globally for producing professionals with the highest standards of skill and competence. He further expressed his confidence on this partnership, with Sri Lankas largest and only fully locally owned cement manufacturer, that will harness the strengths of both organizations, to deliver best in class training opportunities via Tokyo Cements Training Academy that will further reiterate NAITAs commitment and reputation. In addition to developing masons, Tokyo Cement also conducts island-wide awareness programmes for engineers and technical officers of public and private sector to enhance their expertise.

Tours, players...consistency and injury vs recovery
Greetings rugby fans and a Sri welcome to this weeks tour special.
Apologies upfront f th yards skin a few knuckles on the way home.
Definitely a few difficult pills to digest but absolute pre-requisites.
Both our senior teams having a decent leg 1 at the Happy Valley Racecourse in Hong Kong.
The astro grass HKRFC pitch stimulating mixed emotions from all teams without artificial grass at home.
Grand step if the powers that matter question the wisdom of such a series opener.
Not all ARFU members with adequate astro facilities at home....making it fair prep for all teams on the card for the HK leg.
Naturally then, and little cheeky nudge about our Cup winners this leg...Japan, HK, China, Philippines, etc...well set with no need to physically adjust to playing conditions.
For us islanders...aloha boots on fire, more bounce...and plenty of friction burns for brave warriors not familiar and .. tubi-grip friendly.
We managed to fly home despite typhoon warnings and multi curious rice congee breakfast buffet options
Boys ran thru Philippines, showing pleasing fitness and form.
Fair result playing minus 5 regulars.
But still concerns about our set quest in Sri Rugby...to knock Japan and Hong Kong off the top slots.
A realistic challenge that blueprints our 7s pathway in Asia and beyond.
Then top order for our fellow deckchair experts...to kick off our beach slippers...and breathe easy that my 14yrs for Sri on the international 7s circuit has some practical impact and new history.
The girls finally finished Plate champs beating on outside with pace...no. 5 is mighty familiar.
We were Plate winners 2yrs running looking at no.3...my belief in creating consistent capable warriors, not absorbed at the time.
Now thankfully 3 seasons on...the mind energy much better and professional thinking more significant for our 7s future.
Contemplating the remaining 2 legs of the Asian series 2018,critical news that we are struggling nagging injuries with both our squads.
Muthu, Danushka, Jason, Gayan and Kavindu...are woes for coach Woods.
Tough shoes to fill...tougher for selection and Rohan Abeys thinking team...marking the step ups and our push for a top 2 finish in Colombo this October.
The girls also under pressure with captain Hemakumari limping off in HK...and bigger loss in ex skipper Randika fracturing ankle ...during the last 3mins of the Plate final. Shes our no. 1 forward.
The work load now to Wasana W for impact and huge work rate.
All told a decent start to our Asian ambitions.
Lets anticipate effective planning to sharpen our thinking and performance ...under pressure in the middle.
Big heart...big mind...bigger petrol.
Bula bula our 7s players and pure pride for the flag.
7s is the game Sri Api our island fame.
Cheers Cheers.

Transportation sector to embrace digital technology; undergo sweeping changes soon
Minister of Transportation and Civil Aviation Nimal Siripala De Silva assured that the countrys transportation sector will undergo major changes in the coming months in keeping with the developments in digital technology that is transforming and revolutionizing global transportation.
Speaking at the Chattered Institute of Logistics and Transportation CILT International Conference 2018 in Colombo yesterday the minister said the long awaited digital card which would replace the traditional issuing of bus tickets will be a reality within the next five to six months.
We have been dilly dallying too long on this card which is used across many countries in the neibouhood. We were to launch a single card for banking, driving license and other online transaction. However up to now we could not produce a single card, De Silva said.
The ministry with the National Transportation Commission has developed an online bus seat reservation system and GPS monitoring system to track the location and movement of buses. The e-motoring project to put an end to long queues at the Department of Motor Traffic to obtain license will be ready by six month time. This is my innovation to ease the burden of people having to go all the way to the department to obtain license, the minister said.
He said the digital gates at the BIA with traveler information will be through within the next six months to ease the congestion at the airport. There will be no need for anyone to be at the mercy of immigration officials who always look serious and lack a smile.
We have about 30-35 seats at the immigration counters but have only around 5-7 officials to assist in the immigration. We have been discussing the digital passport concept in parliament for the past three years but have failed to produce a single up to now. Our airports are second to none in the world. The latest radar systems will be purchased to enhance monitoring efficiency.

The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka imposed a 100 per cent margin deposit requirement against Letters of Credit opened with the commercial banks for the import of motor vehicles, which are generally used for non-commercial purposes, with immediateeffect. Accordingly, Letters of Credit for the importation of these vehicle categories could be done only with a minimum cash margin of 100 per cent.
The decision to impose the margin deposit requirement is based on recent developments which, if not addressed, could threaten macroeconomic stability. These include the following:
Recent global financial market volatility and generalised pressure on currencies of emerging market economies
Continued excessive motor vehicle imports, partly driven by unwarranted speculation on future exchange rate movements, interest rates movements and budgetary measures
The imposition of the margin deposit requirement, together with the measures already taken by the government with regard to taxes applicable on motor vehicle imports, is expected to curb non-essential imports of motor vehicles, and ease undue pressure on the current account of the balance of payments (BOP) and the exchange rate.

Where is  Fan Bingbing
Chinese superstar Fan Bingbing-the countrys highest-paid actress and one of its most famous celebrities, with more than 62 million followers on Weibo-has reportedly not been seen in public for more than two months, sparking rumors about her whereabouts and concern that she could be in the custody of the Chinese government, after she was caught up in a tax-evasion scandal.
Chinas Securities Daily newspaper reported last week in a since-deleted article that Fan was under control and would accept the legal decision, and alluded to other crimes, but the article never specified those. Best known in the U S for playing Blink in the X-Men franchise and appearing in advertisements for brands like Guerlain and De Beers, Fan hasnt been seen in public since July 1 or been active on social media since late July.
In an attempt to curb what it views as the excesses of the entertainment industry, the Chinese government has recently begun capping payoffs for leading actors at not more than 40 percent of the total production costs.
Fans sudden disappearance from the public eye comes after she was entangled in a public scandal earlier this year over yin and yang contracts, in which stars receive one contract with their actual salary and another contract with a lower wage number to submit to tax authorities.
Documents were leaked in July by a disgruntled TV host, The Hollywood Reporter said this week, demonstrating an alleged tax-dodge scheme by an unnamed major star-instantly identified online as Fan. The actresss representatives denied she was the one implicated in the documents, which claimed to show a star reported $1.56 million for work on an upcoming Chinese film when he or she was in fact paid $7.8 million.
Adding fuel to the fire: Fan received a 0 out of a possible 100 rating on the recently released China Film and Television Star Social Responsibility Report, a joint survey by a Beijing university and the state-affiliated Chinese Academy of Social Sciences Corporate Social Responsibility Research Institute. The report seeks to monitor celebrities as part of the governments crackdown on promoting money worship and distorting social values.

Wide inequalities hurdle to human development
Norway, Switzerland, Australia, Ireland and Germany lead the ranking of 189 countries and territories in the latest Human Development Index (HDI), while Niger, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, Chad and Burundi have the lowest scores in the HDIs measurement of national achievements in health, education and income, released today by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
The overall trend globally is toward continued human development improvements, with many countries moving up through the human development categories: out of the 189 countries for which the HDI is calculated, 59 countries are today in the very high human development group and only 38 countries fall in the low HDI group. Just eight years ago in 2010, the figures were 46 and 49 countries respectively. Ireland enjoyed the highest increase in HDI rank between 2012 and 2017 moving up 13 places, while Turkey, the Dominican Republic and Botswana were also developing strongly, each moving up eight places. All three steepest declines in human development ranking were countries in conflict: the Syrian Arab Republic had the largest decrease in HDI rank, falling 27 places, followed by Libya (26 places), and Yemen (20 places).
Average HDI levels have risen significantly since 1990  22 percent globally and 51 percent in least developed countries  reflecting that on average people are living longer, are more educated and have greater income. But there remain massive differences across the world in peoples well-being.
On average, a child born today in a country with low human development can expect to live just over 60 years, while a child born in a country with very high human development can expect to live to almost 80. Similarly, children in low human development countries can expect to be in school seven years less than children in very high human development countries, said Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator.
South Asia experienced the fastest HDI growth among developing regions with a 45.3 percent increase since 1990. During that period, life expectancy grew by 10.8 years, as did expected years of schooling for children (by 21 percent). The loss in HDI due to inequalities is about 26 percent. South Asia has the widest gap between men and women in HDI at 16.3 percent.
