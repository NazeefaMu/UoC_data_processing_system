Change in UNP top positions in the offing
The United National Party will implement several changes in its top positions to ensure that they are evenly distributed according to provinces and party seniority, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.The minister was addressing a media briefing after he called on Getambe Rajopavanarama Viharadhipati Ven. Keppetiyagoda Siriwimale Nayaka Thera to receive his blessings on April 1.
Distribution of posts according to provincial level without concentrating on a handful of people will provide an enormous strength to the party and the envisaged changes will be submitted to the UNP Working Committee for approval on April 5, he said. Responsibilities of the party will be entrusted to a wider circle to strengthen the party as it had the power to win any future election, the minister said.
Kiriella said the party had rewarded him for spearheading its victory in the Kandy district by appointing him as Leader of the House and he did not aspire for any special post during the impending party shake up.

Fighting a sign of underdeveloped mentality: Health Minister

Fighting was a sign of an underdeveloped mentality, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Dr. Senaratne said this undeveloped mentality has lead to several problems in the country.
They fight for their race, religion and cast because of their mentality.
They try to push the country forward.
It is like adding fuel to a burning fire, the Minister said.
He was addressing the gathering during School Dentists' Association General Assembly held in Colombo recently.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that we get our race, religion, cast etc. with birth and nothing more in them than that. Fighting for them is a mental problem, which needs to be addressed, he said.
Some are fighting against privatization. All of this because of their mentality. Dentistry has a high recognition in New Zealand.
It is a must for disease prevention.
The issues faced by Sri Lankan dentists should be solved and arrangement will be made to solve the issues after discussing with them, he added.

Little Hearts project launched
The unfortunate reality is that every year 3000 children are born with Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in Sri Lanka. Deepening the lament is the fact that each day is a battle between life and death for every one of them, a struggle to keep their beautiful little hearts alive.
To combat this adverse situation, the Sri Lanka College of Pediatricians initiated the Little Hearts project together with many other concerned citizens of Sri Lanka. The project aims to build a ten-story Cardiac and Critical Care Complex at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital.
At a recent press conference held to reiterate the importance of the project, world renowned Sri Lankan Racing Champion Dilantha Malagamuwaa pledged his commitment and continuous support for Little Hearts. The highlight of the evening was the screening of the Little Hearts short film titled "I have a Beautiful Heart". The project committee also put forward the current status of the project, donation collected as well as the long and short term goals.
Speaking about Little Hearts, Dilantha Malagamuwa said "Every time I race, my heart beats fast, because a split second is enough to win or lose. But since I heard of the struggle these little hearts go through, my heart beats faster, because I feel their pain. I wonder if they'd lose their battle against time.
Bringing a smile to my heart, the Little Hearts project was launched. The Cardiac and Critical Care Complex we support to build will heal thousands of little hearts. But now, it is your turn to take this message across and help us extend our line of donors, he further added.
Chairperson of the Little Hearts project Consultant Pediatric Cardiologist Dr. Duminda Samarasinghe speaking at the briefing said, "The project has gained massive support so far.

Yowun Puraya, reflection of peace under new govt: Sampanthan
Yowun Puraya 2017 reflects the changes Sri Lanka has undergone under the new government in favour of peace and prosperity, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said on Saturday.
These opportunities we must not miss to entrench peace, harmony and economic development, Sampanthan noted speaking in the presence of both the President and the Prime Minister at the closing ceremony of the Yowun Puraya 2017 in Trincomalee.He requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue being committed to a peaceful Sri Lanka.
Sampanthan said the previous Rajapaksa regime was one of dictatorship and it is the responsibility of all parties to secure democracy that has been re-established by the Yahapalana government. He also said we should not miss the opportunity Sri Lanka is bestowed upon.
The Opposition Leader pointed out that the previous regime did not seek answers for the hardships faced by Tamil community in a post war era. They thought that the end of a physical war means really the end of a long-term conflict, which is not, he said.
It was in the backdrop where the previous Rajapaksa regime thought the Tamil community are slaves, that the welcomed regime change came about, Sampanthan said.
All parties should assist the coalition government that is on its way to a new destination, he added.
Sampanthan pointed out Sri Lankans face a number of issues such as economical challenges, foreign debt, lack of law and order where as the Tamil community has more issues such as land ownership issues and political prisoners.
Thus, a long term peace process including a solid reconciliation program should enable ethnicities to call Sri Lanka sincerely their motherland.

Antonians come from behind to down Dharmaraja 34-24
Dharmaraja College after leading in the first half fell 11 points short of a win as St. Anthonys College returned to winning ways grinding their way to a hard-fought 34-24 victory in a Division 1 Segment 1A match played at Nittawela. The Rajans dominated for large periods of the first half and should have won this match, but they made several mistakes.
Dharmarajas fine first half display was not respected by the Antonians in the second half in rugby terms anyway. The Katugastota town school showed guts, guile and grace under pressure to secure their victory after being down in the first half. To a man, the Katugastota boys were outstanding and put in a tireless performance from their forwards and backs combing well in the second half. The Antonians showed huge character towards the end of the game making superb last-ditch tackles on the Rajans.
St. Anthonys scored their 34 points (3 goals, 2 tries, 1 penalty) to 24 (2 goals, 2 tries). At the end of the first half Rajans led 24-17 but in the second they were poor failing to score a single point. The entire team made a mess of the simple win they had on offer after their first half display. The losers spent most of the last period of the game defending.
Dinuk Amarasinghe the Antonian captain scored two tries, Mohamed Makrim, Janindu Himsara and Mohamed Shabir one each, Samuel Maduwatha goaled three tries and put over a penalty. For the Rajans, Shenal Perera the captain, Sulanjan Thilakash, Gihan Malinga and Chamika Perera scored the tries with Gihan Ishara goaling two.

[APPRECIATIONS - (03-04-2017)]
Dr. Mohamed Sahabadeen
Universal man
In my life, I die And in my death, I live (Al-Hallaj)
Mohandiaramlagegedera Isakku Lebde Abdulmajeed Mohamed Sahabdeen, so named, also gives a clue to the nature of the man.
Dr. Sahabdeen was a true son of Sri Lanka and his community. From an early age, his love of Sri Lanka and its universalism was expressed by his absolute conviction about the validity of all the great faiths, no better exemplified than in Sri Lanka where viharas, temples, churches, and mosques co-exist within a few yards of one another. His greatest love in Sri Lanka was Adams Peak, which to him, exemplified this unity; with all the pilgrims climbing it from Buddhists, to see the footprint of the Buddha; Hindus, to see the footprint of Vishnu; and both, Christians and Muslims, climbing from different directions, but all seamlessly to see the footprint of Adam. Nothing more to him exemplified the transcendent unity of all religion.
He was born as the eldest of 10 children, in Gampola, to the late Abdul Majeed and Shaharuwan Beebi. He had the greatest of respect and love for his mother whom he describes in his book As a Truly Remarkable Woman. "Though plagued by illness, and for a time, bedridden, she was yet the mainstay and motivating strength in our lives, he said, She had a strong and vivid character...a woman of great insight and natural wisdom.
His schooling was at St Andrews, Gampola, and he went on to study at Kingswood College, Kandy. He was subsequently admitted to the University of Colombo in 1946 with two scholarships. He was a visiting lecturer and head of the Department of Western Philosophy at Vidyodaya University and did extensive research in philosophy and comparative religion, leading to his Doctorate in 1985. His thesis was published in 1986 as the Sufi Doctrine in Tamil Literature, which was soon followed by two other books"The Circle of Life" and "Beyond the Horizon." He dedicated his last book to two women: his late mother Shaharuwan and his wife of 57 years, Halida, whom he describes in his book as his life-long companion.
After his degree in 1950, he went on to be appointed to the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service in 1953. He was placed second in the Order of Merit in this all-island entry. He was Director of Social Services until his early retirement in 1973. But this did not stop him, given his extraordinary experience, by serving on a wide variety of commissions and directorships, which culminated in him being awarded the highest honour that the country could honour anyonethe title of Deshamanya, in 1992.
Following his retirement from the civil service, he served as a member of several Presidential Commissions, including the Public Service commission, the Presidential Commission of Finance and Banking, the Presidential Delimitation Commission, the Presidential Taxation Commission, the Presidential Industrialization Commission, and the Presidential Commission Kokkadicholai Inquiry. Other offices held by him include Muslim Law (Amendments) Committee Chairman, Ceylon Muslim Scholarship Fund President, India-Sri Lanka Friendship Society Vice Patron in 1998, Press Council member in 1998.
He also undertook several entrepreneurial endeavours which were of great benefit to his family and wider community. His visionary thinking enabled the establishment of a long term foundation and structure to an entire community.
He was also seen as a great mediator, both in his public life and private life. Many whom I met at his funeral commented on his patience, empathy, and capacity to listen to the woes and troubles of individuals and advise with great wisdom on how to overcome the trials of life.
He had time for every being, human or otherwise. As my wife Samiya, Dr. Sahabdeens daughter, recalls, as a child, Dr Sahabdeen insisted she did not open a tap by a sink, just in order to give a little ant time to cross from one end of the sink to another, without being drowned by the gush of water. He had said to her there is life in all beings, big or small.
Sahabdeen was a patron of the arts and a lover of nature. He wrote several books on the subject of the Sufi doctrine in Tamil literature and also set up the Deshamanya Mohamed Sahabdeen Institute for Higher Education in Sri Lanka, which was subsequently recognised for the purpose of giving external Degrees by the University of Peradeniya. An arm of this institute is also Pahamune House, which helps children from disadvantaged families.
He also set up a grant for international awards, the Mohamed Sahabdeen Awards for International Understandings in Science, Literature, and Arts, which was recognised by an Act of Parliament. The awards were given to recognize excellence and honour scholars and scientists in the world, and conferred on men and women of intellectual eminence in the Asian region and others who have made original and outstanding contributions to human development on stated fields. Recipients of the award include Dr. C.G.Weeramantry  Former Judge of International Court of Justice, Professor Muhammed Yunus  Nobel Laureate, Dr. Arthur C. Clarke  Futurist, Inventor of the Communications Satellite, Prof. Nalin Chandra Wickremasinghe  Eminent Astrophysicist, Mathematician, and Writer, Dr . Martin Ling  Writer and Scholar in Comparative Religion, Emeritus Prof.Jayant Vishnu Narlikar  Eminent Scientist Researcher and Writer.
His literary works ended with the publication of "Beyond the Horizon," which was a valediction of his philosophy of life, and was edited by Faith Ratnayake. This was exemplified by the recitation of a couplet that is attributed to his grandfather, a great Sufi poet, and this couplet he taught to his children and grandchildren.
There is no beginning and there is no end,
There is only eternal light
I had the honour of conducting the burial prayer for my father-in-law and also of burying him. I was accompanied by my brother-in-law, Rizvan and both of my sons, and I asked them to observe matters closely, so that they may report it to their mother, sister, and grandmother, but also that they may bury me in the same fashion. The Imam who gave the Kothuba sermon, which preceded the burial, said that the Quran and Hadith indicated that there were three meritorious deeds of a person that continued to help the soul in its quest for salvation in the life hereafter. They are firstly, his charity; secondly, his service in dissemination of knowledge; and thirdly, true religious guidance given by him to his children to lead a righteous life and offer prayers.
The Imam said that he bore witness that Marhoom Dr. Sahabdeen had carried out all the three meritorious deeds during his lifetime and in proof, he referred to his charitable deeds carried out by his Trust Foundation the dissemination of knowledge by setting up educational institutions and granting scholarships to the needy and helping in the translation of the Holy Quran and the text of Professor Martin Lings on Prophet Muhammed into Tamil. The fact that his son, Rizvan, and his sons, and myself (to me, he was the second father after demise of my parents), and my sons, participated in the Janaza prayers were testimony to the completion of his deeds of merit said the Imam.
Dr. Sahabdeen took very seriously the words of Confucius (550-478BC), who said, "By three methods, we may learn wisdom: first, by reflection which is noblest; second by imitation which is the easiest; and third, by experience, which is the most bitter."
Dr. Sahabdeen believed in the principle that Human Development is vital to promote social harmony, and that Human Development entails the Development of the whole human personality, through economic, social, intellectual, and spiritual development of man. When he left the Civil Service, he began his work as an entrepreneur building very gradually, brick by brick, one of the most successful companies (Majeed Sons and Sifani Limited) in Sri Lanka. This in turn allowed him to continue with his educational activities including the building of a girls hospital in Madina National School, Siyambalagaskotuwa, a library and a prayer hall in Madina Mahavidyalaya, the Deshamanya Mohamed Sahabdeen Institute, which eventually gave University external Degrees to the students, the Pahamune House Rehabilitation Centre with its UK volunteer teachers for tsunami affected children, including its Information Technology Centre. This also enabled him to set up his awards for International Understanding, Science, Literature, and Arts.
More than anything, he enjoyed reflecting on the nature of human existence and concluded that no philosophy completely answered the enigma of existence. He felt that humankind, through understanding, intellect, and intuition, could transcend their roots and was capable of ascending towards something divine.
He wrote, "In Sufi metaphysics, the absolute being is conveyed, radiating its pure thought, pure light, self-conscious will, which different aspects do not exclude, but complement each other." God as the giver of light is also the giver of inner illumination and summarised the sense of the Sufi doctrine as Verily-we are Gods, and unto Him we shall return.
He quoted Dr Lings If a work of the highest inspiration may be likened to a spark that is struck from a flint, the flint being man and the striker, God, then a revelation as a spark by God from Himself. He wrote that The circle is a symbol of infinity because there is no beginning or end in its circumference.
Further, every point in the sepulchre is equal or equally distant from its centre, thus, representing the eternal proof that every creature is equally near and equally distant from its transcendental ground. He wrote, All great religions have as an inner core, concern with the absolute, which is esoteric in nature, outward form symbolising the absolute, its rituals and ceremonies, for attaining salvation. This explains why historically, identical ultimate reality has been perceived in different forms. He often quoted William Blake
To see a world in a grain of sand and heaven in a wild flower,
Hold infinity in the palm of your hand
And eternity in an hour.
He concluded that When the drop enters the sea, it becomes extinct as a drop, only to become an integral part of the ocean, but when that happens to the drop, one cannot say I am the ocean, nor can the ocean say The drop is not part of me. Such a state is summed up in the Al-Quran as All on Earth shall pass away: there abideth but the Face of thy Lord, resplendent with Majesty & Bounty
"Verily-we are Gods, and unto Him we shall return." (Al-Quran, Chapter 2, verse 156).
He leaves behind his wife, Halida; son, Rizvan, daughter-in-law, Fahima; daughter, Samiya; son-in-law, Dr. Hilali Noordeen; and five grandchildren.

Australia floodwaters still rising
AUSTRALIA: Rising floods continued to plague parts of eastern Australia as emergency workers battled to restore water and electricity in cyclone-hit areas Sunday, with the recovery efforts expected to last several months.
At least two people were dead and several missing after torrential rain inundated large areas of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) states, flooding homes and forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.
Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull looks at damaged and flooded areas on Saturday from aboard an Australian Army helicopter after Cyclone Debbie passed through the area
Category four Cyclone Debbie smashed into Queensland on Tuesday between Bowen and Airlie, ripping up trees and causing widespread damage that is still being assessed.
It was downgraded to a tropical low as it tracked southeast through the week, packing high winds and dumping huge amounts of rain all down the east coast to Sydney before blowing out over the Tasman Sea.
Even as skies began to clear, numerous towns were still on flood alert and some regions remain under water.
Logan just south of Brisbane reflected the varied situation, with rising floods affecting some areas while other parts swung into clean-up mode as waters receded.
This is unprecedented for us, Logan city mayor Luke Smith said Sunday, warning that his city was still in flux with one key river remaining at high levels.
The sky is the limit at this stage about what that means, he added about the potential damage bill. In Rockhampton in central-east Queensland, residents were bracing for the biggest floods they have experienced since 1954, with peak levels set to be reached late Wednesday or early Thursday.
Debbie is not done with us yet, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said when visiting Rockhampton Saturday. The torrential rain also wrecked havoc south of the Queensland border in NSW, bringing severe floods to several towns.
The bodies of two women were found in the state on Friday. Another three people were confirmed dead -- two in NSW and one in Queensland -- on Saturday but police were still investigating whether their deaths were flood-related.
The water busted the door open and dad started to have a panic attack, the son of one of the victims, a 46-year-old man from Murwillumbah in northeastern NSW, told the Courier Mail newspaper. He fell down and it sounded like he was snoring, but he stopped breathing.
There were also fears for three other people missing in flood-affected areas in Queensland, with police searching for them Sunday.
Meanwhile, the military and emergency personnel were working to restore essential services such as water and electricity in towns that were in the direct path of Debbie in northern Queensland. - AFP

For a better cup of tea
Sri Lankas tea industry has been facing immense hardships in recent times, declining in exports, revenue, and production, while operational and labour costs increased. Tea growers in the country faced unprecedented challenges, particularly in the last two years due to extreme weather patterns, weak demand in the tea drinking world, especially the Middle East, Russia, and Ukraine, and tea landscape degradation.
Tea exports are one of the main sources of foreign exchange to the country, and according to available statistics, this amount stood at about USD 1.6 billion in 2014. The annual output usually totalled around 330 million kilograms, but dropped to around 292 million kilograms last year.
Tea plantations and estates provide employment to about one million people directly and indirectly, while the total number of dependents amounts to about 2.5 million. This is to say one in eight people in the country are dependent on this commercial crop.
Drop in production
The tea industry, which was introduced to the country during colonial times, has a history of over a century. Since colonial times, Ceylon Tea has made a name for itself as the finest and cleanest tea, securing the highest unit price at tea auctions and also making the country the third largest tea exporter in the world after Kenya and China.
The drop in production over the years however, has been a worrying factor to those involved in the tea business. It is widely believed that long term application of chemical fertilizer, pesticides, and weedicides to enhance commercial production of tea has resulted in poor soil fertility and land degradation in tea estates.
Added to these, the prolonged dry spell has also contributed to the backward trend in crop yield. Less tea leaves also mean less income for tea pluckers as they cannot match the given target.
Making tea-producing landscapes socially and environmentally sustainable without compromising on the commercial output is a contemporary challenge before the tea sector. Various novel methods have been experimented to achieve this end, while some of them have shown good results with improvements made over time with extensive research.
Arresting land degradation
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) has come forward to mainstream sustainable management of tea production landscapes in a project earmarked in selected locations in India, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and China, with an overall budget of USD 2.1 million. Under the project, sustainable land management practices, have been introduced with the aim to mitigate and reverse land degradation.
It is being carried out in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Rain Forest Alliance.
The project launched in October, 2014, continues till April, 2018. It promotes eco-friendly weed management practices while doing away with herbicides and pesticides.
The use of chemical fertilizer is also curtailed over time and gradually stopped.
Alliance for Sustainable Landscapes Management Director Giri Kadurugamuwa explaining as to how this weed management system works, said what they do is to remove only the noxious weeds, while allowing natural vegetation to grow only to slash it periodically. Though this appears to be simple, this system requires more labour input at its initial stageto identify and remove noxious weeds manually as against chemical weed management.
Yet in the long run, it has proven to be more cost-effective and helpful in reversing land degradation. As it allows beneficial weeds to remain and spread, it contributes positively to the health of the soil and largely contains soil erosiona common problem found in tea estates in the country.
Tea smallholders in the vanguard
This methodology has been promoted among tea smallholders in the country with the help of the Tea Smallholdings Development Authority. Seventy two percent of the total tea production is coming from smallholder farmers numbering to about 400,000, while they hold about 59 percent of the total extent of tea cultivations. According to Kadurugamuwa, 11,000 tea smallholder farmers have already been familiarized with this methodology over the past two years.
Saman Udaya Kumara, a tea smallholder who had adopted herbicide-free integrated weed management practices in his 17 hectare property in Itthegala, Henyayawatte in Udahaupe, Kahawatte, said it helped him raise his income by 60 percent.
The expenditure for cultivations drastically came down as I could save the money spent for herbicides and chemical fertilizer. I commenced reducing herbicides from June, 2014, following the training I received, and stopped herbicide usage by end of 2015. I used to apply about 15,000 kg of Urea fertilizer back in 2013, but reduced it to 4,400 kg in 2016, Kumara said.
Corporate lobbying
Mahendra Peiris, former Superintendent of the Hapugastenne Estate belonging to the Maskeliya Plantation PLC, had been doing extensive research on these eco-friendly weed management practices and has achieved successful results by applying them in the field. It has been found out in his research carried out jointly with Peradeniya University Crop Science Department Prof. S.P. Nissanka that 20 out of the 23 identified noxious tea weeds are tolerant to widely used herbicides, even including the recently banned glyphosate. Thereby, he pointed out that these acutely problematic weed species, which cause great damage to tea crops, cannot be controlled by them.
This finding is a blow to those lobbying to get the glyphosate ban relaxed when it comes to the tea industry. The ban on glyphosate, a widely used herbicide that is also believed to be a silent killer, has not been easy despite the commitment coming from the topmost political authority in the country.
The ban which initially came into force in March, 2014, lasted barely two months, but it was re-imposed in May, 2015. Those who are lobbying against the ban have been arguing that the blanket ban on glyphosate-based weedicides was a factor that contributed to the slow and steady collapse in the tea sector. Reportedly, glyphosate has a black market since the ban came into force.
UNEP GEF Task Manager Max Zieren, who recently visited Sri Lanka, said their project would naturally not go down well with the agro-chemical companies as it is unfavourable to their business. He also cautioned that some of the chemicals he encountered during his field visits to tea estates were already banned in other countries. Commending the ban on glyphosate, he said, was a bold decision to make and called on the politicians not to roll back the policy.
The political authority in the recent times blocked a number of very dangerous chemicals, but last year, there has been very strong lobby by the chemical industry to influence Parliamentarians to remove that Government regulation. The politicians must be wise and responsible enough to ignore these lobbies by the chemical industry, he said.

Celtic clinch sixth straight Scottish Premier title
Celtic have won a sixth consecutive Scottish Premiership title with eight games to spare after thrashing Hearts 5-0 at Tynecastle on Sunday. Brendan Rodgers side needed three points against fifth-placed Hearts to be confirmed as champions after Aberdeen hammered Dundee on Friday.
And they did so with a hat-trick from Scott Sinclair and goals from Stuart Armstrong and Patrick Roberts. Unbeaten Celtic have dropped just four points so far during their campaign.
My job when I came in was to win it in the best way we possibly could, said Rodgers. We have had many outstanding performances but we have only just begun because theres still an awful lot of development in this team. Thats the real exciting part.

Chelsea suffer shock loss as Spurs close in
LONDON, Saturday - New life was pumped into the Premier League title race on Saturday after leaders Chelsea suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace, enabling Tottenham Hotspur to cut the gap at the top to seven points after their 2-0 win at Burnley.
Liverpool won a feisty Merseyside derby against Everton 3-1 at Anfield to move into third place as Chelsea's pursuers were all given fresh hope after Antonio Conte's side lost their first league match at Stamford Bridge since September.
The unlikely reverse, which Conte admitted made the title race more interesting for everyone, left Chelsea on 69 points with Spurs having moved on to 62 and Liverpool on to 59, though the Reds have played a game more than the top two.
Such has been Chelsea's dominance at the Bridge this season that once Cesc Fabregas had put them ahead after just five minutes, it all promised to be plain sailing towards an 11th straight home win in the league for the Blues.
Yet two splendid goals from Wilfried Zaha and Christian Benteke in the space of three minutes soon after changed the complexion of the game with Palace then defending stoically to earn the unlikeliest of wins.
Spurs had appeared to be labouring at Turf Moor without injured striker Harry Kane and they lost Victor Wanyama and Harry Winks -- the latter to what appeared a serious ankle injury -- before the interval.
Yet Eric Dier and Son Heung-min struck in the second half to earn the points, leaving an encouraged Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino to declare:
It was important for us to be there if Chelsea failed -- and we are there. We're there fighting for the Premier League.
With Chelsea on Wednesday next facing Manchester City, who currently lie fourth on 57 points and who first face Arsenal on Sunday, it is little wonder that the Blues defeat has put a new spring in Pochettino's step.
Juergen Klopp will feel invigorated too after becoming the first Liverpool manager to win his first three Merseyside derbies as his side won with goals from Sadio Mane, the inspired Philippe Coutinho and Divock Origi.
Liverpool made it 17 league matches unbeaten at Anfield against their city rivals after Mane's brilliant early individual effort was answered by a first goal for Everton from Matthew Pennington. The youngster, though, was bamboozled less than three minutes later by the skill of Coutinho, who curled a delightful shot into the corner before sealing his masterful display by putting in substitute Origi.
Everton boss Ronald Koeman later criticised Klopp and the Liverpool bench for their crazy response to a bad tackle from Ross Barkley on Dejan Lovren.
Tackles are part of football...we don't make a show from the bench like Liverpool, Koeman told Sky Sports.
I don't like coaches from the bench the whole time shouting to referees and linesmen, making a big show about tackles.
Jose Mourinho was left in a grumpy mood again after his toothless Manchester United, while extending their unbeaten league sequence to 19 matches, slipped up in the race for Champions League places, held to a goalless draw at Old Trafford by West Bromwich Albion.
It was United's 11th draw, which leaves them in fifth place on 53 points.
At the other end of the table, Sunderland's plight is looking increasingly dire following another defeat, with Miguel Britos heading his first goal for Watford in the 1-0 win at Vicarage Road.
Hull City came from behind to beat West Ham United 2-1 with Andrea Ranocchia notching the Tigers 85th-minute clincher, moving them up to 27 points in 18th place while Sunderland are rooted on 20. Craig Shakespeare's extraordinary start to management at Leicester City continued as the champions beat Stoke City 2-0 with goals from Wilfred Ndidi and Jamie Vardy. - Agencies

A coat of many colours
Exactly two weeks ago, I heard a Koha on the tamarind tree outside my window, going "cooey, cooey, cooey". I smiled and told him, "Thank you Mr. Koha for reminding me the New Year is round the corner." As if all my friends on social media had heard him too, that very day I read several posts on Facebook referring to the Sinhala-Tamil New Year.
Sadly almost everyone made negative comments. Almost everyone lamented the New Year equals empty wallets. One friend wrote, "In comes the New Year. Out goes all my money." But, why should this be so Why not begin anew this year and change the tradition of spending too much on gifts and food this April season Why not switch to conspicuous consumption this New Year After all, a new year means new beginnings.
This could mean changing our spending habits, drastically.
This could also mean preventing ourselves from getting into debt over the festivities ahead and adding extra stress to our lives, by choosing to act responsibly with our finances. And, believe me, it's not as hard as we think it is to intentionally stand up against the cultural pressure to spend money and instead, act mindfully with it.
Listening ears
When you think about it, does it not seem as though New Year gift-giving is an interesting and rather strange arrangement We sacrifice our time and money in an effort to buy something manufactured in some far- away place or country, for the purpose of showing love or respect to someone else. I am sure if we calculate it, we will find that we will be spending about 15 hours in the next two weeks shopping for clothes or household items to be given away as New Year gifts.
What if we decided to spend that time with our loved ones rather than at a store shopping for them Consider how sweet our New Year could become if we chose to invest those 15 hours in real relationships with one another.
I know you will agree that in today's world, 60 minutes of fully-devoted listening ears is definitely priceless and far more valuable than anything we can buy and pack into a bag and handover to our grandparents or elderly aunts and uncles on a short visit to see them this New Year.
Charity
In the days ahead we could also remind ourselves that while we go through all the shops in the town trying to find the perfect gift for "someone who has everything," 768 million people all over the world are in need of clean drinking water, and 2.5 billion people live without proper sanitation. Rather than buying another new sari for the aunt who is retired and hardly ever goes out now, our money could be used to make this world better and life more tolerable for countless others. Especially when we know we will gain something invaluable in return. Research suggests that happier people give more to charity and that giving more makes people happier. In this light, wouldn't it be wise for us to start recognizing this opportunity in front of us, to help those in need, as we plan for the happy days ahead
Wouldn't it also be wiser to remind ourselves of Moses Henry Cass's words, "We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children." This New Year, we ought to keep in mind these words of rather frightening wisdom and remember our world's resources are indeed limited. And choose to shop (or not shop) responsibly.
Having said so, I admit that shopping for gifts is inevitable sometimes. Perhaps, removing ourselves from the holiday shopping frenzy need not mean we should break age-old traditions and give up all opportunities to express love through gifts, provided our gifts are meaningful and reflect our affections and gratitude. The easiest way out would be to think of the advice given by Ryan Howell, a psychologist at San Francisco State University when we choose our new year gifts. "The most important thing in the exchanging of gifts is it shows that you really know the person well, and you really care about them," says Howell. This generally means 'tailoring the gift to the recipient' so that the gift you give is an expression of knowing what the other person really wants. It will also be an expression of love as it would mean you took the time to think about him or her instead of buying the first thing you saw in the shop. One thing that all the experts see as the golden rule of gifts, which we hardly ever follow during the New Year, is that it is better to give experiences rather than items. People who receive experiential gifts, such as theatre tickets or a library membership, feel more connected to the gift giver than people who received a new shirt or dress. This simple and sweet idea to gift experiences rather than products this festive season will leave you and the receiver pleasantly surprised at its value in a world where mass consumption is commonplace.
Experiential gifts
Experts have observed experiential gifts are particularly meaningful for kids. Doing something with a child builds memories that last longer than mere stuff. "If gifts are about expressing and forging love, one of the best ways to do that is with your own time. That will always be a really powerful gift." So, as you sit down to plan everything for this month's festivities, from the sweetmeats you are planning to make, to gifts and visits, consider getting seriously honest about what will not bring you or anyone else much joy or value so that you can scratch it off your to-do-list. Maybe skip the extra kilo of cake this year, or kindly refuse to attend that friend of a friend's new year party. A minimalistic spending style need not mean spending as little as possible - it should mean planning to do only what is important.
Practice frugal spending this New Year and you too will be singing with Dolly Parton,
"Although we had no moneyI was rich as I could beIn my coat of many coloursMy momma made for me"
Avoid overspendingthis April
1. Set a Budget.
Before you begin your New Year shopping, decide how much money you want to spend. Think through all the different aspects of new year shopping: clothes, household products, food. Divide your budget into the different categories: how much do you desire to spend on clothes how much will visiting friends and relatives cost how many special events are on your calendar and how much will they cost If the numbers aren't lining up, what changes and/or sacrifices do you need to make
2. Be Aware of Retail Tricks.
If merely creating a budget was the only thing needed to keep us within our spending limits, we'd be all set-not just for the holidays, but for life. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Even with budgets firmly established, many of us overspend. One reason this happens is because retail stores are shockingly good at getting us to part with our money.
Loyalty cards, discounts, bargain sales-all of these represent tricks that retail outlets employ to get us to part with our money. Be on the look-out for them-especially during the holiday season.
3. Limit self-gifting.
One of the most significant festivity trends over recent years is the increase in "self-gifting"-people treating themselves to presents when they are out shopping for others. Nearly 60% of people are now self-gifting according to research. So to avoid overspending this holiday season, limit yourself in this regard.
4. Establish expectations early.
If you decide to cut down on the number of New Year gifts you will be giving this holiday season, it is important to establish those expectations early. For example, you could give three gifts to your children: one thing they want, one thing they need, and one experience to share with the family. Similarly, if you intend to take a new gift-giving approach to your extended family, it is helpful to inform them early about your decision and why you decided to make it.
5. Track spending.
One key component to wise financial stewardship is to track your spending on a daily basis. This is true for life, but it is essential to avoid overspending during the April season. If you have set your budget thoughtfully, it is important to pursue due diligence in staying inside it.
Because of the extra shopping during the season, the importance of tracking your spending during the month of April cannot be overstated. And you do not need fancy software or materials to accomplish this step. It can be completed with a simple piece of paper and pen-at the end of each day, just record the items you spent money on that day. And compare it regularly with the budget you created.
Avoiding overspending during the holiday season may not be easy. It certainly requires extra time and effort. But trust me, it will be worth the effort.

Consensus government established to create peace, reconciliation, development: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he and President Maithripala Sirisena had joined hands and established a UNP-SLFP consensus government to create peace, reconciliation and development during the present day youth generation because they both witnessed the holocaust of war during the most part of their youth.
The Prime Minister was addressing the gathering at the concluding ceremony of the Yovun Puraya 2017 youth camp held at the Meheyzer Stadium, Trincomalee on Saturday.
The UNP and SLFP at loggerheads fighting for power in the past and they had now come together to ensure a better future for the youth of this country rather than themselves, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said lives of thousands of youth in the armed forces, terrorist and innocent civilians were lost in vain during the war. If their strength and effort could have been deployed to develop, the country would have been able to match countries like Malaysia in development today.
An opportune moment had come today for all to join hands and march towards development goals. The duty of all parties including the UNP, SLFP, JVP, TNA, SLMC and all and sundry today was to ensure a better future for the country by ushering in development, he said.
The Prime Minister said he had worked as a deputy minister and minister when he first entered Parliament in 1977 in the J.R. Jayewardene government which ushered in massive development schemes such as the Mahaweli Development Scheme, Sri Jayewardenepura Capital City Development Programme, Free Trade Zones and Gam Udawa Housing programme.
Later, under the R. Premadasa government, they were able to grant free school books and uniforms and open up garment factories in remote areas. His pledge to the youth was that the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena would ensure a far greater development to the country and a promising future for the countrys youth, the Prime Minister said.
The government had been in a position to start rapid development schemes because it had been able to unite several parties for a common endeavour and win over lost international confidence. The Ruhuna Development Programme would generate thousands of employment avenues. Investment promotion zones and tourist industries would be launched in Wayamba and the development programme from Kandy to Hambantota was now in its initial stages.
Arrangements had been made to develop Trincomalee and adjacent areas. Plans were afoot to develop the North which was devastated by war. Nuwara Eliya and Badulla would be developed as tourist zones. The President had initiated a programme to develop Polonnaruwa under the Pibidunu Polonnaruwa programme, he said.
The Prime Minister said the Youvun Puruya 2017 was held in Trincomalee in response to a request made by Opposition Leader R. Sambandan. He wished to thank each and every one who had contributed towards making the event a success.
He said Rs. 120 million had been disbursed so far under the Gamata Kotiyak programme. The youth leadership in villages had launched projects valued at Rs. 500 million by utilising that nucleus fund. Next time the disbursement under the Gamata Kotiyak programme would be increased from Rs. 75,000 each to Rs. 150,000 and the number of projects to be doubled from 1500 to 3000, Wickremesinghe said.
Added to this, the Swashakthi would open many self-employment avenues for youth, he said.
The very people who criticised the offer of land on 99-year lease today, offered land on 99-year lease to several Indian hotels during their time. They even tried to sell landn outright to certain foreign firms. How could creating 700 to 800 industrial factories in the country be considered as a total sell off of the country, the Prime Minister asked.

## Title: DANGER OF COMMODITIZING SUSTAINABILITY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, April 3, 2017 - 01:00
DANGER OF COMMODITIZING SUSTAINABILITY
Old habits die hard, even when new ways of thinking and doing are being either promised or claimed or assured. We are now in an era where we are buzzing the word sustainable at everything, anything, anyone, everyone. Few of us understand what this word really means but one thing is certain. Even before it has been fully understood, it is in danger of becoming stale and going the route of such words and phrases as green, conflict transformation, nation building, reconciliation, integration and good governance.
The reason is quite easy to understand: we are attempting to market and promote something which we have understood but little and realized but less. Without knowing it, we are using the mechanisms of failed classical socio-economics on a process that is the antithesis of it. Doing so, we are headed for a major disaster even before we start because a few pretty basic, pretty stupid things have happened to bring about this state of affairs.
The first is that there are quite a few people who have jumped on the sustainability bandwagon believing that it is an opportunity for profit. Even a person with marginal intelligence knows that sustainability is a process  an opportunity (if opportunity it is), to subsume ones individualism within the collective consciousness and commonalities of a nation pulling together for the preservation, regeneration, enhancement and continuation of life. Many times over the last few years Ive heard phrases such as organics fetch a higher price so why dont we try to position ourselves to tap those markets and use sustainability as our promotional slogan or if I can become the only manufacturer of natural fertilizer, I will be the don of the sustainable age, or if our products are accredited and certified there will be greater acceptance in global markets.
Bitter dreams and dashed hopes
The rationale behind such thinking is easy: all that these people want to do is leverage any effort coming under sustainability to make  the least sustainable of all thingsmoney. If a sustainability effort ends up with commandeered markets with just one fertilizer manufacturer, one rice mill, one fruit distributor, one soap maker, one physician know then that we have won nothing but lost much.
All we would have done is created
a new word for old nonsense. What must be understood is that in a sustainable world, profit is merely a collateral outcome of a process and not a primary goal.
Financial gain is a happy positive but not an essential. The minute anyone thinks otherwise, we are back in the old humdrum of markets promoting sweet nothings to people desperate for hard somethings. Go this route and all we can hope to do is sustainably consume bitter dreams and dashed hopes.
The second is that quite a few people want bragging rights. The right to claim that they were the first and the best in pushing a community, a nation and region a planet towards sustainable living. Even a person who is not too smart will know that sustainability is a process so complex when set against the modern realities of the world that no single person can or should claim hero status for its establishment.
They cannot. If they think they can, they have been guilty of oversimplifying the infinitely complex. By its very definition it is a process that requires very large numbers of very wise people to be given hands-off ownership of the process at any level, at every level. To do this, every individual, group, community should be allowed to do their thing the way they want to do that thing.
Over time, these pockets will organically merge into common collectives. If anyone attempts the insanity of forcing them to adhere to this or that, vote for this or that, salute this or that, sign-in to this or that, they should understand then and there that the effort is doomed.
If someone can do that, he doesnt need to become the next leader of a nation to be respected for what he has done. She neednt be looked upon as the great bountiful goddess of sustainability to feel a sense of worth. No. Just the simple, personal knowledge of having done something well, something durable, something sustainable is sufficient.
The third is that quite a few believe that sustainability can be achieved as quickly and as easily as flipping a switch. Sorry folks.
If we want to do things quickly, easily, conveniently or politically, we might as well go back to the industrial era.
That was an age where time was money. That was a time where IQ tests were devices to test how quickly people can do something not how well people can do it. That was an era where quality was measured by how many people bought something over ten days not on how good something was that they never had to replace it over the next ten years. It was a period where the next election determined the development cycle. The way of doing things sustainably is directly opposed to such tactics.
Lies on goods, services or politics
Sustainability takes time and it doesnt care at all for individual agendas or fiefdom economics or party politics. It cannot be promoted to the human collective if it is not present exactly as claimed upon the ground. It will not tolerate failure or post-failure finger-pointing. It is not dependent on positive and hopeful slogans but on cold assessments of what is possible, probable and impossible when measured against social and temporal parameters.
It takes care to exquisitely create things that are durable. It does not create things that have short sharp burst lifetimes and which hardly qualify as produce and products. It doesnt do things in contravention of natures timetable just because the political timetable for delivering results is different.
In the industrial era, politicians, businesspeople, civil agents, activists, media and researchers could and did lie through their teeth about what is good, what is bad, what is right, what is wrong, what is popular, what is not.
They collectively fibbed, blatantly, on how well or how badly a country was governed or its security and happiness was assured. In the sustainable era, nobody can lie. If they do, then they get caught quickly because one of the key foundations of sustainability is to stop buying into lies be they lies on goods, services or politics. You see, the sustainable man cannot be fooled and to try to fool him is foolish.
So, let us take a step back and assess these things soberly. Let us be circumspect and thoughtful. Let us be considerate and careful. Let us not make age old mistakes in our attempts to curve out a new age for our children. Let us not try to commoditize sustainability and go the route of desiring gain, or fame or praise which will only result in pain for all. We cannot do that when we are trying to collectively overturn centuries long loss, shame and blame so that all will live content.
Let us understand that if we are shooting for the world, we must take a pass on the stars.

Dealing with our past to ensure peace (transitional justice) : Cometh the hour
The term transitional justice is a series of measures developed after a traumatic conflict to ensure that peace and stability will last, that the rule of law will prevail, and that a cycle of violence will not be repeated.
Societies that have experienced serious trauma, such as armed conflict or authoritarian rule, need to prevent new episodes of violence and oppression. In order to do that, states conduct different policies to examine the past, pursue accountability, provide for the well-being of violence survivors, and improve their institutions.
Societies that avoid looking into the past fail to build sustainable peace. Traumatic memories dont simply go away. Grievances can go on for generations, and even centuries, becoming entrenched in culture and historical accounts, and risking new cycles of violence.
Over the years, dealing with the past has become an accepted policy approach to build peace and consolidate democracy, directly linked to governments human rights duties. There is now extensive shareable experience about principles and best practices, so that each country can find its own way to satisfy its historical, legal and moral obligations.
The best way to deal with the past is implementing a set of actions that complement and support one another:
 Reparations for victims recognize the gravity of the violations suffered and provide means to rebuild lives. Reparations include many types of assistance, not just financial compensation, which limited resources dictate can only be provided to a small percentage of victims. Reparations foster empathy and compassion, recognizing the common dignity of survivors, such as widows and orphans; those survivors who lost their physical integrity, their psychological health, their land and means to make a living.
 Special offices such as an Office of Missing Persons or a Truth Commission, seek to uphold the right of victims and society to know the truth about what happened. They provide an authoritative account of the facts, establish the fate or whereabouts of the missing, and make policy recommendations to avoid the same things happening again.
 Judicial inquiries, particularly on those most responsible for violations and abuses, seek to restore the rule of law, and individualize responsibility, so that the honour and reputation of institutions is preserved. Trials shouldnt single out one side in a conflict but seek to punish individuals most responsible for very serious crimes that all humanity condemns. Fair trial standards and the presumption of innocence are the foundation of such judicial processes.
 Measures of non-recurrence focus on improving the professionalism of key state institutions, such as the judiciary, the educational system, and the security forces, to ensure that they encourage reconciliation and avoid practices that are prone to abuse. This often involves additional professional training and new resources to modernize institutions.
All these measures work better if they are based on lessons learned from previous practice, human rights principles and meaningful consultation with society. They need to respect national culture, law and experience. For many years, Sri Lanka has had experience investigating facts, providing reparation and seeking sustainable reform. Recent consultations with citizens in all regions of the country, and public survey results, reaffirm that dealing with the past in a fair way is supported by Sri Lankans of all backgrounds and regions.
It is critical that all these actions incorporate the need for participants to share their experiences freely, without fear of reprisals or renewed trauma. Protection of victims and witnesses, and psychosocial care are indispensable elements of any policy to deal with the past. Processes should be objective and mutually respectful without pre-judging any institution or individual.
The different measures must also pay special attention to the rights, voices and needs of sectors of the population usually overlooked or marginalized. Women victims require special attention, as well as children and young people, and persons with disabilities.
Finally, for these actions to be credible and effective, they must always work in an independent, fair and impartial manner and link logically to each other. For example, a Truth Commission might refer someone who has suffered serious harm to a Reparations Office or to the Office of Missing Persons to assist them in practical ways.
The Lessons Learnt Reconciliation Commission
In 2010, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa appointed the Commission on Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation (LLRC), with a mandate to look back at the conflict and also look ahead for an era of healing and peace building in the country, and make recommendations, ensure that there will be no recurrence of any internecine conflict in the future.
The LLRC recommendations:
The many recommendations made by the Commission also include the following recommendations relating to:
 Justice and Rule of Law:-Emphasis that all allegations should be investigated and wrongdoers prosecuted and punished irrespective of their political links, so as to inspire confidence among the people in the administration of justice; -The need to renew the confidence of the public in the criminal justice system and the rule of law;
 Missing Persons:-Adopt a comprehensive approach to address the issue of missing persons as it would otherwise pose a serious obstacle to any inclusive and long-term process of reconciliation (9.48).
- The Commission emphasises (9.49) that the relatives of missing persons shall have the right to know the whereabouts of their loved ones. -They also have the right to know the truth about what happened to such persons, and to bring the matter to closure.
- All efforts should be made by the law enforcement authorities, in cooperation with relevant agencies, especially the ICRC, to trace the whereabouts of the missing persons and ensure reunification with their families. The families should be kept informed of the progress being made in this regard (9.50).
- Reconciliation is a process. Closure is the first difficult emotive step in that long and complex journey irrespective of whether they are victims of conflict or victims of LTTE terrorism. This will also enable them to seek appropriate legal remedies including compensation/ reparation.

Delicious mushrooms
Mushrooms are known for their nutritional value and medicinal value. Mushroom cultivation provides gardeners with a steady source of income. According to reliable sources mushroom consumption dates back to several hundred years BC in China. The Chinese value mushrooms for medicinal properties as well as for food. Ancient Romans and Greeks, particularly the upper classes, used mushrooms for culinary purposes. Food tasters were employed by Roman emperors to ensure that mushrooms were safe to eat, because there are poisonous mushrooms. Garden Talk speaks to District Agriculture Instructor, the Office of the deputy provincial Agriculture Director (Extension) Colombo, Thanuja Jeewandara on this highly delectable food item.
Mushroom varieties that can be found and eaten in Sri Lanka are
* American Oyster ( these varieties have been researched and developed)
* Abalony (these varieties have been researched and developed)
* Urupaha ( can be found in Sri Lankan villages)
* Leena hatu
* Idalolu
* Heenvali Hathu
Jeewandara described at great length the procedure of growing mushrooms -
"The growing of mushrooms is a long procedure. There are a certain amounts of inputs that are necessary. You need ingredients such as saw dust, rice brand, soya or green gram flour, dolomite, magnesium sulfate and water to facilitate its growth. You need a PVC Pipe, rubber band and cotton wool and polypropylene bags and a barrel with a lid to act as the vessel.
ThanujaJeewandara
The saw dust must be prepared by removing the debris, woody parts and maybe insects that may be present. It is then mixed with Dolomite and other ingredients. Magnesium sulfate is dissolved in water and then mixed into the saw dust. This medium is then exposed to the water. However if there is too much water, the fungus will not grow.
Then you fill the Polypropylene bag with the prepared medium. We then send the opening of the bag through the PVC Pipe (like inserting a ring onto a finger) and then insert a cotton bud into the opening. To prevent the cotton from getting wet we tie the opening with a rubber band. We then use a grease barrel with a lid. We then fill the barrel with the right amount of water and then lower a wooden/ steel frame into the barrel. This is the frame that the Polypropylene bags will lie on top. The lid will then be placed over the barrel but the lid will have a small opening. Then we heat the water and the bags will be sterilized. The lid needs to be airtight and the steam will rise up through the opening. This opening is there because the heat generates temperature and pressure both. Without the opening the barrel may explode. To prevent that we make a hole in the lid.
After 20 minutes it heats up and the steam rises. We allow this to happen for two or three hours- a continuous rising of steam. We let it cool then for three hours. The result are completely sterilized bags with the medium - with no insects or fungus or anything.
Then we take the sterilized bags and introduce the mushroom seeds into it. These seeds come in packets that we can buy. We can buy one packet for Rs. 120. One packet contains 200g.
Let's say you want to grow Abalony or American Oyster mushrooms - there are seeds for that. So you introduce them into the bags. We introduce around 25 - 30 seeds into the bags, and then the bag is sealed again.
Then the bags are introduced into the incubation room. The room temperature and the relative humidity is very important. If the temperature is too high there will be no growth. The temperature has to be Celsius 28 - 30. The Humidity has to be around 85 - 90. Also the room has to be dark - 75 percent.
When it comes to Abalony the bags need to become completely white in color. When it comes to Abalony it takes 40 to 45 days. American Oyster takes 25 - 30 days.
After that it is introduced into the cropping room. There the conditions are different. The temperature and humidity is the same as the incubation room. But it needs sunlight - 75 percent. Here it needs moisture and ventilation. So what we do is we spray water. But before doing this we need to cut the opening that is encircled by the PVC Pipe. Once that is done the Polypropylene bags are opened.
After three or four days we can see the new mushrooms emerging. One bag can be kept for two and a half months. From one bag you can reap the harvest six or seven times. One bag yields 300g - 400g in two and half months."
Small scale farmers
"Growing of mushrooms is done by small scale farmers. It does not take up much space. And the cost of cultivation is low. It is a good protein source. Also it is good for vegetarians. You can use as value added product. You can make a variety of dishes with this," stated Jeewandara
However we must guard against poisonous mushrooms. Here we must be mindful of mushrooms with dark colors. They should be avoided. Mushrooms with a ring and vulva must be avoided. Also we must avoid mushrooms if we see that birds and animals avoid it. "We can confidently eat any mushroom available in the market. Mushrooms have medicinal value because they are a source of protein and prevent some diseases," pointed out Jeewandara.

The group's long standing relationships with their key clients, some over 50 years, also show that they have successfully built an incredibly strong network and trust from the clients," Ashish added.
The group represents a prestigious list of over 60 local and international clients including some of Sri Lanka's largest advertisers Ceylon Biscuits, Sampath Bank, Dialog Axiata, Fonterra and Sri Lanka Tea Board. The Grant Group has received various accolades at local and global industry events, from Agency of the Year awards, to Response Marketing as the most effective independent agency for telecommunications globally at the Effie awards.

" More importantly given the growth in the market and the push towards digital, we need a strongly aligned and committed multinational partner with digital at its heart as brands grapple with the challenges of a changing media landscape. We are very excited to be able to tap on the network's resources and work with the 38,000 great people at Dentsu Aegis Network.

Elon Musk enters the world of brain-computer interfaces
EVER since ENIAC, the first computer that could be operated by a single person, began flashing its ring counters in 1946, human beings and calculating machines have been on a steady march towards tighter integration. Computers entered homes in the 1980s, then migrated onto laps, into pockets and around wrists. In the laboratory, computation has found its way onto molars and into eyeballs. The logical conclusion of all this is that computers will, one day, enter the brain.
This, at least, is the bet behind a company called Neuralink, just started by Elon Musk, a serial technological entrepreneur. Information about Neuralink is sparse, but trademark filings state that it will make invasive devices for treating or diagnosing neurological ailments.
Musk clearly has bigger plans, though. He has often tweeted cryptic messages referring to neural lace, a science-fictional concept invented by Iain M. Banks, a novelist, that is, in essence, a machine interface woven into the brain.Latest updates Ivanka Trumps new jobDemocracy in America2 days ago Venezuela leaps towards dictatorshipAmericas2 days ago The worlds most dangerous cities Graphic detail2 days ago.

Eurozone inflation slows in March
Inflation in the eurozone slowed dramatically in March, according to official estimates.
Eurostat said its initial estimate found inflation slowed to 1.5%, from 2.0% in February.
The European Central Bank targets inflation of close to, but below, 2%.
With inflation running close to that target, ECB chief Mario Draghi has been under pressure to wind-down efforts to stimulate the eurozone economy. But the latest report could ease that pressure.
According to Eurostat, the decline in inflation was partly due to lower oil prices, but food price inflation also eased.
"March's sharp slowdown in eurozone inflation was partly driven by temporary factors that will reverse in April, but the big picture is that inflation is now on a downward trend," said Jack Allen, eurozone economist at Capital Economics.
"There is little sign that declining unemployment is putting much upward pressure on wages and prices."
The ECB has been attempting to stimulate the eurozone economy with negative interest rates and a bond-buying programme.
Economists say the easing of inflation pressures will allow the ECB to keep those stimulus measures in place.
"The ECB is likely to maintain its view that the economic recovery has not put inflation on course to meet its medium-term goal. So we expect it continue purchasing assets well into 2018, and leave interest rates on hold until even later," Allen said.
Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said, "The decline this month after a four-year-high last time may indicate inflation has hit its peak, although you can't rule anything in or out at the moment. Germany especially will be hoping Draghi can continue to keep it under control."
The data did not have a big impact on the euro, which was trading a little higher against the dollar at $1.0687.
A revision of the inflation data, based on more complete information, will be released on 19 April.

For cat lovers and exercise enthusiasts, free yoga classes filled with feline friends sounds like a pretty good deal. But these classes are offered with a larger purpose in mind: The cats need homes.
The P.A.W.S. Animal Adoption Center in Bangor, Maine, offers free monthly cat yoga classes as a way to introduce potential new pet owners to some kitties in need. P.A.W.S. executive director Shelley Butler told the Bangor Daily News Monday that the classes were a win-win because yoga has therapeutic benefits cats bring joy to many people.
Butler got the idea for the monthly classes after reading about other animal shelters in the U.S. with similar offers.
The trend started when yoga practitioner Jeanette Skaluba, a volunteer at the now-closed Homeward Bound Pet Shelter, in Decatur, Illinois, posted a video of her performing the practice with kitties to YouTube, according to Yoga Journal.
Skaluba started a website devoted to the concept called Yoga For Cats, though the trend has also been dubbed Meowga.
At New York Citys Meow Parlour, the Big Apples first cat cafe, Yoga and Kitty classes are offered five times a month in partnership with the nonprofit organization KittyKind. The parlours teacher Amy Apgar leads groups in 30 minutes of cat playtime and 45 minutes of yoga.
These cats are all up for adoption. Some of them are special needs, she told CNN. Some of them have been through a lot.
And theres a happy ending for the cats in Bangor too. Since P.A.W.S. started offering the sessions in January, all of the cats that have participated have been adopted, the organization revealed.

Google reveals latest UK tax bill
Google was charged 36.4m in UK corporation tax last year, according to its latest accounts.
The US search engine giant recorded sales of 1.03bn and a pre-tax profit of 149m in the UK for the 12 months to the end of June 2016.
Like other major tech firms, Google has come under pressure over its tax arrangements.
Labour said the firm was still not paying its "fair share" of tax in the UK. Google's accounts also showed it hired an extra 600 workers to take its UK workforce to nearly 3,000 last year. Google is adamant that it is paying the 20% rate of corporation tax on its UK profits that businesses have to pay.
But the debate over its tax affairs is likely to rumble on, because of the way in which it organises its activities across international borders.
Google declared turnover of just over 1bn in the UK in the year to last June. But the latest accounts filed in the US by Alphabet, Google's parent company, show UK sales of more than 6bn. One reason for the discrepancy is that it treats its business here as a development and marketing services operation. Sales are booked in the Irish Republic, where the tax rate happens to be lower.
A Google spokesman said: "As an international business, we pay the majority of our taxes in our home country, as well as all the taxes due in the UK.
"We have recently announced significant new investment in the UK, including new offices in Kings Cross for 7,000 staff."
Google agreed to pay 130m in back taxes to the UK last year, which was widely criticised as not being enough. The sum covered money owed since 2005 and followed a six-year inquiry by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). George Osborne, who was chancellor at the time, described the deal as a "victory", but Labour's John McDonnell said the sums were "trivial".
The agreement came after years of criticism of Google and other multinational firms over their tax arrangements in the UK and across Europe.
McDonnell said the latest figures showed Google was still not paying enough tax.
He said: "It is a national disgrace that by paying just 36m in tax Google could have an effective tax rate lower than many working families in our country.
"And it exposes the complacency at the heart of this Tory government, which is allowing this to still continue despite last year's scandal."
He added: "It seems that the so-called 'successful' tax deal with Google that George Osborne boasted about last year has meant that they are still not paying their fair share under his successor Philip Hammond."
Meg Hillier MP, chair of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), said: "Yet again we see a large corporation paying a rate of tax that belies its significant presence and business transactions in the UK.
"This is why the PAC is working internationally to press for greater tax transparency so that we can all see clearly how much tax corporations pay and where.
She added: "There is already strong international support and growing collaboration for changing the way tax is reported by multinationals.
"This latest tax contribution from Google just underlines why this is so important."
HMRC declined to comment on Google's tax payment, saying it did not discuss identifiable taxpayers.
An HMRC spokesman said, "Everyone has to pay the tax due under the law and we do not settle for less.

Govt giving step motherly treatment to local entrepreneurs - Minister Daya Gamage
Sri Lankan government is giving step motherly treatment to local entrepreneurs and giving preferential treatment to foreign companies accused Minister of Primary Industries, Daya Gamage.
Speaking to media in Colombo he said that if the government gives 100 local entrepreneurs all the support and assistance they can turn around Sri Lanka to be another South Korea.
This what the Korean government did by assisting local companies like Hyundai, LG, and Samsung to be world business icons today.
He said in contrast local companies are being texes from head to toe from the time its being established and even when exporting. The previous government even created a special act to take over my Higurana sugar factory. Unfortunately the present government even after two years have failed to give my company back and do justice.
On an earlier occasion the Ministry said that when his company was taken over none of the Chambers raised their voice or spoke against it. in public.
Gamage who is having his own domestic aviation company and involved in Micro finance and several other businesses said that his company together with an US based financier forwarded his proposal to run the national carrier, SriLankan and his bid was even not short listed to be among the last five.
Whenever foreign investor obtains land for a project they are offered long term leases even up to 99 years and its not so for local companies where the agreement is less than 30 years.
I cant understand this attitude of the government and also ashamed to say that even despite being a Cabinet Minister I can not change this mindset.
Asked if he plans to have a domestic airline with schedule flights he answered in the negative. With the Colombo Matara highway there is hardly any one flying to Koggala and this would happen when the completion of the Colombo Kandy highway as well.
The only opening are for the East and Jaffna and I prefer to operate charter flights from my helicopters as and when there is a requirement.

Hull get relegation lifeline as Ranocchia downs West Ham
LONDON, Saturday - Hull City's Andrea Ranocchia headed home a late winner as they beat West Ham United 2-1 at home on Saturday to boost their Premier League survival hopes and extend the visitors winless streak to six matches.
Ranocchia met a corner from substitute Kamil Grosicki and flicked his header past Darren Randolph in the 85th minute to take 18th-placed Hull up to 27 points, provisionally level with Swansea City in 17th, ahead of the Welsh side's home game against Middlesbrough on Sunday.
West Ham striker Andy Carroll opened the scoring in the 18th minute when Hull centre back Curtis Davies misjudged Aaron Cresswell's ambitious cross and the towering forward controlled the ball on his chest and finished calmly past Eldin Jakupovic.
Hull had never lost a Premier League home game against West Ham and Andrew Robertson dragged them level with his 53rd-minute equaliser against the run of play, firing low past Randolph after fine interplay with the impressive Grosicki.
West Ham are on 33 points and will hope to secure their first league victory since early February at Arsenal on Wednesday when Hull host Middlesbrough in a relegation six-pointer.- Agencies

President Maithripala Sirisena noted that the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Chairmanship was accepted by him not to crown any of his family members but to lay the foundation in ushering a prosperous future for the country.
The President added that he never appointed his son illegally to any post of the Youth Force or any other youth front misusing powers of the Presidency.Unlike the past, even his son was amongst the gathering and not given a seat on the stage.President Sirisena was addressing the National Youth Convention of the SLFP at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium yesterday. The National Youth Convention was held under the patronage of President Sirisena after a lapse of 13 years.
The convention, which was held on a grand scale was attended by thousands of youths from all parts of the country. The President also launched the official website of the National Youth Front at the convention.
President Sirisena further added that the government never hesitates to take action against corrupt politicians. A clean, honest and honest political force has become a timely need of the country.
Youths and the entire community as well feel the political thirst of having such a clean, honest and active political force, the President noted.
President Sirisena further added that if any politician tries to fill his pockets with illegal money collected through monetary misconduct or through misusing state and public resources, he would never hesitate to take tough action against those responsible for such misdeeds without considering the political status.

He said he had discussed the referendum with President Maithripala Sirisena before going abroad and a few important decisions had been made. A solution that can be accepted by all will be given soon, he said.
The Minister said South Korean President was taken into custody, but she did not commence a hunger strike like some Sri Lankan politicians. All should obey the countrys law, he said.
We should not look at the issue on the Wilpattu National Park from a racist view point. The Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims lived there chased away by the LTTE within 24 hours during the war. They should be allowed to go back and settle down their original homes, he said.

Doctors will launch an islandwide public and private sector strike on April 7 morning, in protest of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
The continuation of the strike will be decided by 4.00 pm on the same day.
Discussions are underway with doctors who conduct full time private sector service to halt all private health services, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA head Quarters in Colombo today he said that the strike will continue if the GMOA Executive Committee decides to do so at 4.00 pm meeting on the same day.
Dentists, Ayurvedic doctors, Veterinary surgeons and others will take part in the strike, he said.
The Government should take the responsibility for all the difficulties to be faced by patients due to the strike because it had dragged the SAITM issue for months, he said.
He said solutions to the issue had been handed over to the Government by the GMOA, State Medical faculty deans and the Lecturers' Union of the State Medical Faculties.
However, Dr. Zoysa said, accident services, maternity hospitals, children's hospitals, the cancer hospital, kidney hospital and dialysis units and places where dengue affected child patients are being treated in the Trincomalee district will not be affected by the strike and all services will continue in them.
The services will continue in those institutions without any interruption, he said.
This week will be named as the Anti-SAITM Week and several political parties and their trade unions will also join in the country-wide protests against SAITM, he said.
Jathika Hela Urumaya, JVP, Front Line Socialist Party, Joint Opposition are some of the parties that have promised to join.

JSA votes for Kannans removal
The Judicial Services Association (JSA) has unanimously adopted five resolutions seeking the removal of Ramanathan Kannan from the position of High Court Judge.
The resolutions had been passed at a special meeting of the JSA held on Saturday. Sources said the President in a discussion with the JSA has agreed to correct any procedural errors with regard to the appointment.
The first resolution of the JSA states that it requests President Maithripala Sirisena to remove Ramanathan Kannan from the position of High Court Judge as the appointment has no force or avail in law. It states the Judicial Services Commission (JSC) and the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) have re-affirmed that the recommendation with regard to the appointment of Kannan has no force or avail in law.
The JSA in its second resolution requests the JSC to recommend the President to remove Kannan from the position of the High Court Judge. Its third resolution requests the JSC to consider not allowing Kannan to function as High Court Judge till he is officially removed from the said position.
The fourth resolution states the independence of the judiciary has been violated by the controversial appointment of Kannan and requests the President and the JSC to restore and uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary.
The last resolution requests the JSC to refrain from recommending nominations submitted to them from the unofficial bar for appointing High Court Judges directly in future. It states the appointment of Judges for High Court from unofficial Bar undermines the knowledge, experience and sacrifices made by the District Judges and Magistrates who work under immense pressures and difficulties for long periods of time in difficult areas during their career.
However, Bar Association of Sri Lanka Secretary Amal Randeniya speaking to the Daily News said the BASL is not in agreement with the JSAs last resolution. It is not proper to close the avenue to make appointments from the unofficial bar. We admit there had been procedural lapses in the appointment of Kannan as a High Court judge. There had been no transparency in it. We observe that a proper set of criteria must be adopted when making such recommendations hereafter, he said.
He said the reaction of the BASL with regard to the JSA resolutions would be made known following its Executive Committee meeting on Wednesday. He said the proposals of the BASL with regard to the matter would be forwarded to the Bar Council.
When contacted by the Daily News, the JSC remained non-committal over the matter. Its Secretary P W D C Jayathilake said the JSC had not yet received the content of the resolutions. However, sources said the JSC could do little at this instance as it could only intervene when there is complaint related to a disciplinary matter.

To keep U.S. Jobs, Chip makers pin hopes on Trump
Nestled at the foot of the Wasatch Mountains here, the IM Flash plant is a paragon of American high-tech manufacturing.
Robots glide along the ceiling, moving silicon wafers the size of dinner plates between hulking machines that deposit and etch microscopic layers of material to build the most advanced memory chips in the world.
For the 1,700 technicians and scientists who tend to the robots and troubleshoot problems in the delicate manufacturing process, the jobs offer generous pay and benefits and easy access to Utahs many outdoor attractions.
For Intel and Micron Technology, the two American companies that jointly own and operate IM Flash, the venture allows both of them to sell cutting-edge, three-dimensional memory chips while sharing the multibillion-dollar costs of a modern semiconductor factory.
The memory chips produced at the plant are probably one of the biggest advances of technology in the last 20 years, said Jon Carter, who oversees Microns strategy for new memory products.
And, as he was quick to point out, all of the work was done in the United States. Micron has done a really good job of having a good footprint on the home front, he said.
In many ways, however, the IM Flash plant is an outlier. While companies based in the United States still dominate chip sales worldwide, only about 13 percent of the worlds chip manufacturing capacity was in this country in 2015, down from 30 percent in 1990, according to government data.
hip makers attribute the decline to a variety of forces, including high American tax rates and the hefty subsidies offered by foreign governments for new semiconductor plants, which can cost as much as $10 billion.
Its quite a bit more expensive to build a factory in the U.S., said Stacy J. Smith, the executive at Intel overseeing manufacturing, operations and sales.
Intel  which predominantly manufactures in Oregon and Arizona but also has factories in Ireland, Israel and China  estimates that the extra cost for an American plant is more than $2 billion.

Lewandowski hat-trick as Bayern crush Augsburg
Berlin, Sunday- Bundesliga leaders Bayern Munich demolished Augsburg 6-0 with forward Robert Lewandowski scoring a hat-trick to protect their 13-point advantage over second-placed RB Leipzig who beat bottom club Darmstadt 98 4-0 on Saturday.
The Bavarians, who face Real Madrid in the Champions League last eight this month, remained firmly on track for a record-extending fifth consecutive Bundesliga crown with yet another dominant performance.
Lewandowski, who joined Borussia Dortmund's Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the top of the scorers list with 24, beautifully controlled a Thiago Alcantara pass with his right foot and turned to shoot Bayern ahead after 17 minutes.
Thomas Mueller, who earlier hit the woodwork twice, put the ball over the line with his knee in the 36th and Poland forward Lewandowski slotted in 10 minutes after the restart to kill off the game.
Thiago grabbed a deserved goal to make it 4-0 before Lewandowski completed his hat-trick and Mueller earned his second goal to lift Bayern to 65 points.
What can I say about him said Bayern coach Carlo Ancelotti about his prolific Polish striker. Lewandowski did what he normally does. He scored three goals and set up another two.
I am happy to have a forward who more or less scores in every game.
Leipzig are second on 52 after their win, Naby Keita scoring twice against Darmstadt who collapsed following the sending-off of Sandro Sirigu in the 72nd minute. Dortmund failed to keep pace, stumbling to a 1-1 draw at Schalke 04 in the Ruhr valley derby to drop to fourth on 47, a point behind Hoffenheim, winners 3-1 at Hertha Berlin on Friday.
Aubameyang put visitors Dortmund ahead with his 24th goal of the season and celebrated by putting on a superhero mask, as he had done in past derbies.
But Schalke fought back as 20-year-old Thilo Kehrer rescued a point with a powerful low shot in the 77th minute for his first Bundesliga goal.
Schalke demanded a penalty for a hand ball in stoppage time and the team mascot caused a furore after the final whistle, racing to the referee to show him a red card over his refusal to award the spot-kick.
Werder Bremen continued their climb up the table, crushing hosts Freiburg 5-2 with a hat-trick from Dane Thomas Delaney and their fifth win in six league games lifted them to 11th on 32 points.
Hamburg SV also moved away from the relegation playoff spot after Lewis Holtby's stoppage-time goal gave them a 2-1 win over Cologne and lifted them to 13th. Eintracht Frankfurt missed a penalty in their goalless draw against Borussia Moenchengladbach to remain in seventh place, outside the European spots.  Agencies

MDMK chief Vaiko sent to judicial custody for pro-LTTE speech

A Chennai court sent Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) chief Vaiko to 15 days judicial custody on Monday for speaking in favour of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 2009, the Live Mint said.
Vaiko, who has been seeking early disposal of the pending case, surrendered before the court on Monday and refused to apply for bail.
Consequently, the magistrate had to remand judicial custody.
The MDMK leader who had been supporting the cause of Tamil Eelam (independent state for Tamils in Sri Lanka), in a public meeting in 2008, had alleged that the Union government was aiding the Sri Lankan government and warned that India would not remain a single country if the war against LTTE in the neighbouring country was not stopped.
The Chennai police in 2009 booked him for charges including the Section 124 A (sedition) and 13(1)b of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Act, 2004.
Tamil Nadu had witnessed widespread protests in 2008-09 during the last phase of Sri Lankan civil war and had asked the Central government to intervene to stop the war in the neighbouring island nation.

MMDA needs reform: All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama

The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, in a statement released today, said the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) needs reform.
The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) is a topic which has been spoken widely in many circles and forums these days, it said in the statement.
In this regard, the ACJU believes, without doubt, the MMDA as it stands today definitely needs reforms. 
Quoting the Quran it said,  Oh you who believe do not hold as unlawful the good things Allah has made lawful for you" (Chapter 5, Verse 87).
It is clear from the above verse that the ACJU neither has the power to make what is unlawful lawful nor the power to make what is lawful unlawful.
 Unfortunately, the statement made by the President of the AC]U that the "Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA) is perfect in its present state has been subjected to misinterpretation.
In fact, what he wanted to express was that our predecessors who were involved in formulating the MMDA had taken great efforts to make it near perfect.
Of course, given the circumstances of that period.
This does not imply that need not be any reforms today to the Act, mainly in the administration of Quazi court system.
There has also been an unfair allegation against AC]U that it is not ready to listen to the grievances of the women, it said.
There is no truth at all in this allegation.
ACJU wishes to highlight that it will be a gross violation of Islamic religious teachings to ignore the women or not to give them the honour and respect that Islam has bestowed on them.
ACJU is therefore, bound by these religious teachings.
These misconceptions and the communication gap that is dominating events today need to be removed. We strongly believe that it is through dialogue that we can sort out all our problems.
The Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act, is a topic which has been spoken widely in many circles and forums these clays.
In this regard, ACIU believes without doubt, the MMDA as it stands today definitely needs reforms. As Religious Scholars are willing to be flexible and accommodative to the fullest extent.

The government on Thursday announced the list of airlines that will be connecting unserved airports in the country. In the first round of bidding, Air Odisha Aviation has won the bid to connect the maximum number of unserved airports in the country.
Other carriers which have won the bids to fly to unserved airports in tier-2 cities include Air India's subsidiary Alliance Air, Air Deccan, SpiceJet, Air Odisha and Turbo Megha.
50 per cent of seats on every flight will cost Rs 2,500 per seat under the UDAN scheme. This will be applicable for flights where the distance is less than 500 km or one-hour.
Over 45 unserved and under-served airports would be connected under the scheme - UDAN (Ude Desh ka Aam Naagrik) that seeks to make flying more affordable.
UDAN network will cover the whole country, giving a major economic boost to hinterland areas, Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju tweeted.
This will have a positive effect on the economy, in terms of employment and investment, Raju added.
Indias domestic air passenger traffic grew at a record breaking rate of 23 per cent in 2016 - amongst the highest in the world.
Unseating Japan, India became the third largest aviation market in domestic air traffic with 100 million passengers in 2016.
In a century of Civil Aviation in India, only 76 airports became operational with scheduled commercial flights.

The Murakami Effect
Translation is a kind of traffic, in nearly every sense of the word. Theres the most obvious sense, in that translations cross borders of time, place, and culture, moving from one language into another.
But traffics other meaningthat is, the buying and selling of goodsalso applies. Translators themselves can be said to traffic in words, sounds, images, and more; whether what is trafficked is tangible or intangible, its implied that what is bought, sold, and bartered is in any case commodified. When we think about traffic we also inevitably think about congestion, about impediments to smooth circulationof vehicles, of course, but also, by extension, of ideas and things. While translations do cross borders, broadening our cultural knowledge as they present one language in the terms of another, they can also become an impediment to free communication. As a translator of contemporary Japanese fiction, Ive seen both the flow and the congestion, and have witnessed at close range the unintended consequencesand our lack of control as translatorswhen it comes to the way our texts move or fail to move across borders.
Economic concerns
For the past decade or so Ive been working on what is essentially an ethnography of the publishing industry, primarily in Tokyo and New York, and the way the intersectionand often the collisionof aesthetic and economic considerations influences what gets translated, how it is translated, and how it is marketed and consumed in another literary context. That is, ultimately, how the traffic of translation is subject to the larger economic concerns of the publishing industry, and how these concerns shape a canon of literature in translation that may bear little resemblance to that in the source literature and culture, but that comes to play an important role in the way that culture or nation is perceived in the national imagination of the target culture.
So, for example, reducing the argument to its simplest terms, in the 1950s and 60s, Yukio Mishima and Yasunari Kawabata were translated, marketed, and read in the US as representatives of a newly docile, aestheticized, Zen-like Japanese culture that was explicitly meant (by translators and publishers and perhaps policy experts as well) to replace the bellicose wartime image of Japan, as Edward Fowler has argued. This was one piece of a general rehabilitation strategy for the country in concert with promoting its new role as a reliable ally in the US Cold War calculus. At the same time, however, this image bore little resemblance to the positions Kawabata and Mishima often occupied in the domestic Japanese literary canon or marketplace.
Cultural capital
In more recent years, Haruki Murakami has been similarlythough quite distinctlymarketed as the foremost literary representative of what Douglas McGray has called Japans emergent Gross National Cool. That is, at some point after the bursting of its economic bubble at the end of the 1980s, Japan began a transition from being a producer and exporter of industrial and technological products (Honda Civics and Sony Walkmen) to being a producer and exporter of cultural capital.
As its hold on industrial domination receded, it succeeded, more or less, in reinventing itself as a possessor and wielder of soft power and cultural capital that could rival US global hegemony in the popular culture imagination. In effect, Hondas and Sonys were replaced by Pokmon and anime and sushi. At that point Haruki Murakami was, I would argue, more or less consciously identified as the most likely literary equivalent of this phenomenon. His slacker narrators and magical-realist plots were key to his selection for translation and export as another form of Japanese cultural cool, at a moment when the world was increasingly receptive to the notion that Japanese film, fashion, and food carried with them a kind of global cultural cachet. In other words, Murakamis fiction, apart from its literary value, became a kind of cultural product representing a certain view of Japan as futuristic pop phenomenon. To cite just one example of this, when the translation of his bestselling novel 1Q84 was published in 2011, I remember walking out of the Harvard Coop in Cambridge, where a wall of the heavy volumes had been stacked in the lobby, and into the Urban Outfitters store where there were equally impressive stacks of the book, but this time they were clearly intended as fashion accessories to match the rest of the disposable books that chain tends to sell. - Lit Hub

Navy seizes Rs. 162 million worth of drugs
Sri Lankas Naval fleet units on patrol in the Northern waters seized 13.5 kg of drugs worth Rs. 162 million and took into custody six Indian nationals and an Indian fishing boat yesterday morning, Navy spokesman Lieutenant Commander Chaminda Walakuluge said.
SLNS Ranawickrama (Fast Gun Boat) on patrol attached to Kankesanthurai rounded up the suspicious boat.The Navy became suspicious when they saw it was a Dove boat. Usually, small Dove boats are used by Indians. Our fishermen do not use these Dove type boats. So we kept monitoring the boat, Walakuluge said.
It is also unusual for such a small boat to carry more than two people. There were six individuals in the small boat, he explained.
When the Navy searched the boat, we were able to find two large parcels of drugs, which are suspected to be heroin, he added.
The apprehended drug parcels, boat and alleged Indian fishermen were brought to the Kankesanthurai harbour around six oclock in the morning, the Navy spokesman said.
The suspects and drugs were handed over to Kankesanthurai Police for further investigations, he said.
Lieutenant Commander Walakuluge said in 2016, the Navy nabbed 130kg drugs including cocaine and heroin. He said the Navy has also seized 1,240 kg of Kerala ganja within the same period.

Net foreign flows into CSE jump to 2 year high
The Bourse took a turn and ended in the green as the ASPI increased by 65.66 points (or 1.10%) to close at 6,061.94 points, while the S&P SL20 Index too increased by 22.20 points (or 0.65%) to close at 3,438.88 points.
Turnover and market capitalization
JKH was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 1.43Bn or 23.51% of total turnover value.
Singer Sri Lanka followed suit, accounting for 22.35% of turnover (value of LKR 1.36Bn) while Sunshine Holdings contributed LKR 0.75Bn to account for 12.44% of the weeks turnover. Total turnover value amounted to LKR 6.06Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 4.31Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 1.21Bn (+40.81% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.86Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 1.21% W-o-W (or LKR 29.51 Bn) to LKR 2,662.86 Bn cf. LKR 2,633.35 Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 41.22% (or LKR2.50Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Sunshine Holdings & Melstacorp which accounted for 93.01% of the sectors total turnover.
The Trading Sector meanwhile accounted for 22.39% (or LKR 1.36Bn) of the total turnover value
with turnover driven primarily by Singer Sri Lanka which accounted for 99.82% of the sector turnover.
The Banks, Finance & Insurance Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 15.86% (or LKR 0.96Bn) to the market. The sector turnover was driven by Commercial Bank, Bimputh Finance & Sampath Bank
which accounted for 67.79% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume too, accounting for 42.57% (or 94.68Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR2.50Bn. The Banking, Finance & Insurance sector followed suit, adding 18.30% to total turnover volume as 40.70Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR0.96Bn of total market turnover value. The Telecommunications Sector meanwhile, contributed 17.91Mn shares (or 8.05%), amounting to LKR0.20Bn.
Top gainers and losers
Browns Capital was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 66.67% W-o-W from LKR 0.90 to LKR 1.50. Hapugastenne Plantations gained 31.93% W-o-W to close at LKR 21.90 while Kelsey Developments gained 30.55% W-o-W to close at LKR 50.00.
Peoples Merchant (+29.91% W-o-W) and Bimputh Finance (+26.17% W-o-W) were also amongst the gainers. SMB Leasing[X] was the weeks highest price loser, declining 33.33% W-o-W to close at LKR 0.20. PC Pharma(-25.00% W-o-W), Swarnamahal Finance (-12.50% W-o-W) and Kegalle Plantations (-11.71% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.
Foreign investors closed the week in a net buying position with total net inflows amounting to LKR 1.82Bn relative to last weeks total net inflow of LKR 1.32Bn (+38.32% W-o-W). Total foreign purchases increased by 59.38% W-o-W to LKR 4.45Bn from last weeks value of LKR 2.79Bn, while total foreign sales amounted to LKR 2.63Bn relative to LKR 1.47Bn recorded last week ( +78.19% W-o-W).
In terms of volume, Sunshine Holdings and JKH led foreign purchases while Amana Takaful & Browns Investments led foreign sales.
In terms of value, JKH & Sunshine Holdings led foreign purchases while Dimo & Watawala led foreign sales.
Point of view
Markets reverted five consecutive weeks of W-o-W losses this week as the Bourse bottomed-out from its over-sold position aided largely by foreign investors & HNIs. Despite hitting a 1-year low of 5974.9 points on Monday, the benchmark index recovered ~87 points over the week to close ~61 points above the key psychological barrier of 6000 points.
Average turnover levels too reflected similar positive momentum, averaging a 4-week high of LKR 1.21Bn, ~40% higher than the Y-T-D average turnover level of LKR 0.73Bn, and 29% higher than last weeks average turnover level of LKR 0.86Bn.
The revived market momentum stemmed partially from HNI and Institutional buying interest which contributed to 37% of the market turnover amid strong interest in counters as JKH (41% of the crossings) & Sunshine Holdings (33% of the crossings).
Significant foreign interest was also a major contributor to momentum, and the net foreign position on the bourse improved for the 9th consecutive week, with net buying increasing 38% W-o-W to end at LKR 1.82Bn.
Foreign inflows to the CSE have remained largely consistent since Jul16 (excluding a brief outflow in Jan), hitting a >2-year high of LKR 4.6Bn in Mar17.
Net inflows to the CSE over Q117 was LKR 4.6Bn (cf. an outflow of LKR 2.2Bn in Q116) as fund flows towards EM/FM assets have resumed as the recovery in the global economy has relieved earlier pessimism over the potential for the new U.S. administration to impose protectionist trade policies1.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to maintain similar positive direction.
Urban inflation in March hits a high of 7.3%
Urban inflation levels in March rose to a high of 7.3% Y-o-Y (cf. 6.8% Y-o-Y in Feb), mainly driven by base effects from low inflation in March 2016.
While both Food and Non-food inflation contributed to the Y-o-Y increase in headline inflation in March, food inflation declined M-o-M over March (-0.7%) while non-food inflation rose marginally (+0.1%) over the month.
Given that the impact from tax-structure adjustments should wane over the coming months and assuming the prevailing drought conditions ease, inflation is expected to revert back to mid-single digits over the near-term.
The CBSL last week raised policy rates ~25bps as a precautionary move in order to contain inflation expectations and demand side inflationary pressures.
However, the Monetary Authority raised policy rates by 25bps (as opposed to the widely anticipated 50bps) citing improved fiscal conditions and the upward adjustment that has already occurred in market rates.
The CBSLs delivery of a lower-than-expected rate hike and less hawkish tone in its policy statement thus implies that growth remains a concern and that the CBSL is unlikely to raise rates further if they can shore-up additional FX reserves and inflation remains within the IMF-recommended targets.

New action plan to stop the spread of Red Palm Weevil
A new action plan to stop the spread of the Red Palm Weevil has been endorsed at a high-level meeting at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome.
Agriculture ministers and other government representatives today agreed on a new strategy to fight the pest. It includes national interventions such as improved pest monitoring and greater involvement of farmers, as well as international efforts such as a proposed ban on the import of palms larger than 6cm wide from infested countries.
The endorsement came after scientists, pest control experts, farmer representatives and others took part in the Scientific Consultation and High-Level Meeting on Red Palm Weevil, hosted by FAO with the International Centre for Advanced Mediterranean Agronomic Studies (CIHEAM), to share the latest research and agree the best way forward.
The red weevil destroys palm trees by eating them from the inside, and has rapidly expanded its global spread to more than 60 countries. It threatens date and coconut palms, as well as ornamentals.
Factors contributing to the spread have been late detection of infested palms because of insufficient inspections, a lack of engagement with date and coconut farmers, improper assessment of the risks, few natural enemies of the pest, difficulties managing mass trappings across large oases networks, lax quarantine, improper disposal of infested trees, and difficulty controlling the pest in private homes or small family gardens.
"The Red Palm Weevil has become a global threat and demands a global strategy to eradicate it," said FAO Director-General Jos Graziano da Silva. "The message coming from the scientific consultative meeting is a positive one: The Red Palm Weevil can be controlled and defeated."
Proof is in the Canary Islands. It was declared free of the pest in May last year, after implementing a coordinated strategy that included tight monitoring controls and the removal of all infested trees. In Mauritania, detection of the pest in an oasis triggered quick action by the Government with the support of FAO to implement an integrated pest management strategy that had farmers and farmer cooperatives at the core. The pest has been successfully contained to the original infestation area, without any outbreaks in the past six months, and with continued control efforts it is likely the area will be declared pest-free.
Integrated pest management involves farmer training, regular inspections, trapping using pest-attracting pheromones, tracking infestations, removing heavily-infested trees, tight quarantine controls, and monitoring progress of the integrated approach.

Not so sweet !
We know that most obese people are candidates for type 2 diabetes  thats if they havent already got it.
What they all have in common is a higher than normal blood sugar and thats one aspect of diabetes that does the most damage to many of the bodys major organs.
Now, through new research, we know one of those organs is the brain.
For some time weve known diabetes patients are more likely to get Alzheimers. But weve been puzzling over the link between sugar and dementia. Now we know.
Extraordinary research has revealed a tipping point at which blood sugar levels become so dangerously high they promote brain disease.
Middle age spread can cause dementia with lack of exercise leading to 'rapid mental decline' according to study. Scientists have found a link between Alzheimer's and sugar. Once levels pass this threshold, they inhibit a vital protein, which, under normal conditions, fights the brain inflammation seen in dementia.
The new study by the University of Bath and Kings College London helps explain why the high blood sugar levels in diabetes increases the risk of getting Alzheimers and vascular dementia.
But whats the specific link between glucose and Alzheimers
In this new research, scientists tracked that link by studying brain samples of 30 patients with and without Alzheimers. They were tested for the protein damage caused by high glucose levels in the blood. The link between diabetes and dementia has been known for some time (Photo: Getty)
They discovered, in the early stages of Alzheimers, protein damage inhibits an enzyme that prevents a build up of brain plaque  the abnormal protein which is characteristic of Alzheimers.
It destroys brain tissue. Furthermore, as Alzheimers progresses, damage to this enzyme worsens.
Professor Jean van den Elsen, of Bath University, believes that sugar damage could be a tipping point that allows Alzheimers to develop.
Dr Rob Williams, biochemistry researcher, added: Knowing this will be vital to developing a chronology of how Alzheimers progresses and we hope will help us identify those at risk of Alzheimers and lead to new treatments or ways to prevent it." Eating too much sugar could attack your brain (Photo: Getty)
Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimers Society, said: We know that diabetes can double a persons risk of developing dementia but we still dont really understand how the two conditions are linked. This study offers a vital clue.
The researchers have found a specific effect of high blood glucose on an enzyme in the brains of people with Alzheimers, providing a plausible biological mechanism connecting the two conditions.
With diabetes on the rise, a better understanding of how it affects brain cells can help us to find ways to help people with diabetes manage their risk of dementia.

Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race goes ahead after WWII bomb removed
London: The annual Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race will go ahead on Sunday after an unexploded World War II bomb was safely removed from near the course on Londons River Thames.
Police were called on Saturday after a member of the public spotted the device near Putney Bridge, yards from where the historic event will get under way.
Marine experts examined the submerged bomb and it was removed by specialist officers, Scotland Yard police said.
Chief Inspector Tracy Stephenson said: Im very happy to update that the ordnance has now been safely removed and the race will be going ahead as planned.
We have been working very closely with the organisers of the boat race to plan this event, which is eagerly awaited by spectators and supporters alike.
Thousands of people are expected to line the banks of the Thames to watch the 163rd edition of the race between the two universities.
The mens event starts at 1635 GMT, while the womens race begins at 1535 GMT.
A spokeswoman for the event said the race was only ever called off during World War I and II. AFP

Peradeniya University closes

The University of Peradeniya has been temporarily shut as over 30 percent students at the university have taken ill with a viral flu.
Approximately 1,500 students have been admitted to the Kandy and Peradeniya Hospitals.
It is suspected that they might be suffering from the H1N1 influenza but this has not be confirmed as of yet.
Kandy General Hospital, Director General, Dr Saman Ratnayake said the students from the university have been allocated a separate ward for treatment.
Vice Chancellor of the University, Upul Dissanayake said he made this decision after it was recommended by an advisory committee comprising of all the Deans at the university.
This measure, taken to control the spread of the viral flu has also asked that all students vacate university premises by 12 noon tomorrow.
Dissanyake explained that they hoped to close the University for the upcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year from April 9 but they had to close earlier given the grave health situation.
The date on which the university would be re-opened has not been decided and will be informed to the students at a later date.
The H1N1 virus has spread rapidly in the Central Province with 17 people thus far succumbing to it.

For the perfect cuppa
Everyone likes their tea a bit differently, whether you put on a stopwatch while you brew the bag for three minutes or add so much milk it barely resembles tea at all.
Theres also some debate about whether we should add the milk before or after the hot water (obviously it should be after - how on earth does it brew properly if you cool it down with milk first!)
But what we really should be focusing on is the water if we want a truly perfect cup of tea, however strong or milky you like it.
A tea expert has revealed the one thing you should never do if you want a good cuppa. William Gorman, chairman of the Tea and Infusions Association says you should only ever boil the water once. So those of us who top up the kettle several times a day and flick it on, re-boiling the same water, are doing ourselves out of a perfect brew. What does boiling water again do Gorman said that repeatedly boiling the same water strips it of some of its oxygen and nitrogen, resulting in a dull beverage. And then things get really controversial...
Gorman also advocates us microwaving our tea to warm it up instead of reboiling the water.
Usually when peoples tea goes cold they reboil the kettle and make another cup. But doing this you are guaranteed to give yourself a dull cup of tea. You need freshly drawn water for a good cup because reboiling it takes out all the oxygen and nitrogen out of it.
A better solution is to put it in the microwave for 15 to 20 seconds. When you microwave tea all youre doing is from a scientific point of view is just moving the molecules around and getting it back up to a decent temperature. It is not impacting the flavour at all. So, there you have it. Only fill the kettle up with the water you need for your mug and always change the water before you pop it on. The Telegraph

Protect yourself while travelling abroad!
Dr. Palitha Mahipala speaks about the diseases people should be vigilant of before and after trevelling overseas. A large number of
Sri Lankans travel to various countries for various purposes and they need to take care of their health and the health of their loved ones.
Q - A large number of Sri Lankans are traveling abroad for various purposes. Mainly what are the diseases one should be vigilant of while travelling
A - International traveling has been considered as one of the main ways of spreading diseases across the countries. This is common to Sri Lanka too. Basically two kinds of diseases spread (1) Existing diseases such as Malaria, Yellow Fever etc (2) Emerging diseases such as Merse Corona Virus, Ebola etc
Dr. Palitha Mahipala
From time to time, depending on the situation, WHO informs its member countries about precautions to be taken. With regard to Sri Lanka, Malaria and Yellow Fever situattions are important as Malaria is eliminated and Yellow Fever is not reported in Sri Lanka for many decades.
Therefore people traveling to countries where Yellow Fever is endemic, vaccination is mandatory. Yellow Fever is endemic in African and South American countries predominantly.
For Malaria, prophylaxis treatment as well as reporting to health authorities if fever developed after returning are very important. Malaria is endemic in African countries and Asian countries. These measures are being taken to prevent international spread of disease and to protect individual travelers who may be exposed to such diseases.
On the other hand, diseases such as Zika Virus and it's complications like Microcephaly, Guillain Bare Syndrome pose a new type of public health threat with long term consequences for families, communities and countries. So traveling to those countries during pregnancy needs to be avoided.
Q - What should be done before traveling to such a countries 
A - As already explained, vaccination and prophylaxis chemotherapy are required and avoid unnecessary traveling as much as possible.
Q - What should be done after returning from an affected country 
A - The general public, specially travelers need to be informed about these public health issues and should be enlightened on what to do after returning to the country.
If symptoms develop, go to health authorities to seek care and report about travel history.
Q - What should be done if family members travel with us to an affected country 
A - Better avoid or refrain from traveling when there is an international spread of an emerging disease. Diseases like malaria and yellow fever require prophylaxis treatment and vaccinations.
O<U+200B>nce <U+200B>people return to the country from abroad, if symptoms like fever with cough, sore throat, etc develop they should report to the closest MOH (Medical Officer of Health or PHI (Public Health Inspector) and seek treatment based on the countries visited at least within two weeks of returning.
This is a must for protecting the health of the traveler, his/her loved ones and entire society.

Researchers discover on-off switch
A breakthrough has occurred in the fight against HIV, new research reveals. Scientists say theyve engineered an on-off switch into a weakened form of HIV, enhancing the safety and effectiveness of a potential vaccine for the virus.
They say this could be the final necessary step to eradicate the disease thats killed 35 million people since the beginning of the epidemic in the 1980s.
Vaccinologists often prefer exposing the body to weakened viruses, rather than deactivated ones, because they grant stronger and longer-lasting immunity. But weakened viruses retain the ability to replicate, meaning that they still pose a risk of becoming full-blown pathogens.
Researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln began addressing this issue in 2014, when they genetically engineered a version of HIV that needs a synthetic amino acid - one not found in the body - to replicate.
Doing so required the team to replace a codon that codes for the amino acid in the HIVs genetic code.
Each codon instructs an amino acid to connect to a chain that becomes a protein and ultimately allows viral replication.
The team swapped out one of these codons for a nonsense version that instead signals a stop in the amino-acid assembly line, halting production of the proteins essential for replication.
When the team supplied the synthetic amino acid, the assembly line began churning out proteins, and the virus began replicating. When the supply of amino acids stopped, so did the replication. This technique gave the team control over the HIVs replication. And by delivering a consistent supply of amino acids, the team showed that it can kick-start the multiple cycles of replication necessary for an effective vaccine. Safety is always our biggest concern, said Dr Wei Niu, an associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. In this case, [it means] were one step closer to generating a vaccine.
Other research teams have managed to generate HIV immunity in organisms, with one vaccine protecting 95 percent of rhesus monkeys against the virus. Many of these vaccines have relied on deleting HIV genes to limit replication, but the virus penchant for mutating can help it overcome this defense and replicate unchecked.
Dr Qingsheng Li, a professor of biological sciences, said the teams combination of a nonsense codon, genetic switch and synthetic amino acid represents an especially rigid set of safeguards against unchecked replication. Thats the big milestone, said Dr Li. If that works well, we need to go to the pre-clinical animal model before going to a clinical trial. Thats our goal and road map.

NEW COMBINATION OF DRUGS COULD ELIMINATE HIV
HIV could be eliminated using a novel combination of drugs, claims a research team on the brink of an unprecedented experiment.
Scientists at Case Western Reserve University's medical school have been granted $2.5 million to try pairing two never-before-combined AIDS treatments in a human clinical trial.
The properties - a natural protein that kills disease and a lab-made antibody - have been separately used in HIV-suppressing drugs for years.
Our current line-up of medication is highly effective: roughly 30 percent of America's 1.2 million people with HIV have reached an undetectable viral load - meaning treatment has suppressed the virus to the point it is untransmittable.
But lead researcher Dr Michael M Lederman believes a combination of these two properties could 'produce more of a wallop in tandem than when administered individually'.

Newcastle took the lead in the 36th minute when Dwight Gayle netted his 22nd goal of a productive season, but Wigan, who had scored only once in their previous five matches, responded through Michael Jacobs dinked effort in the 50th minute.
However, Newcastle have repeatedly demonstrated their resolve in their testing title race this season, and Ritchie restored their lead seven minutes later when he headed home after his initial effort came back off the woodwork.
We've got seven games left and we have to keep on winning, Ritchie told Newcastle's official website (www.nufc.co.uk). You've just got to have the desire to get over the line.
We've worked hard to get into this position.
We just need to continue to work hard, stay focused and keep the same mentality that we have done throughout the season, because we're in a great position at the top of the league.  Agencies

' SL could reap economic benefits from Colombia'
The Sri Lanka-Colombia relationship could be harnessed to reap real economic benefits for both countries, which have so far not been tapped by either country, Honorary Consul to the Republic of Colombia, Chamindra Gamage said.
At present Sri Lanka exports cinnamon to Colombia and we do not import anything from Colombia. Colombia is oil rich and full of natural resources. It has strong trade and business ties with USA, he said.
Sixty percent of total export volume to Colombia is Cinnamon and pure Ceylon tea could be promoted in a big way. Being one of the major sugar producers, Sri Lanka could get a lot of assistance from Columbia to develop its sugar industry in a big way, he said at Galle Face Hotel recently, where an art exhibition took place.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera was the chief guest while Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Colombia Patti Londona participated as a special invitee.
Gamage said he was hoping to encourage Colombian investors to invest in Sri Lanka, where they could also tap huge free trade markets.
He also said that Sri Lanka also could explore more export opportunities in Colombia such as tea, Batik. Gamage added that a Sri Lanka-Colombia Business Council would be set up with the support of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce to facilitate the planned ties.

SMB Leasing expands its geographic footprint with new branch in Negombo
SMB Leasing marked a new chapter in its remarkable turnaround story inaugurating another branch in Negombo. The opening ceremony lead by Deputy Chairman Umesh Gautam and CEO Sumedha Fernando marks another milestone for the financial institution which recently moved into a new head office and was able to declare its first dividend to shareholders since going public.
Commenting on the occasion and speaking to media Umesh Gautam, Deputy Chairman highlighted with great pride the firms journey to get to this point. This branch opening is symbolic of the great strides this company has made. This journey began in 2010, when the institution faced significant burdens through high NPLs and low capital adequacies, a negative asset value, and mismanagement stemming from ties to the Ceylinco group. Uncertainty over the future of the company was high and the challenge before us was daunting and required a collective effort from all stakeholders.
Thanks to the diligence and leadership of the management team, the hard work and commitment of all the employees, the vision and direction of the board and the support from the loyal customers the company was able to methodically and patiently address the key hurdles, right the wrongs, and steer the company into steadier waters. Since 2012, the company has been able to grow its income and net asset value every year organically and conservatively.
Over these years, the company has hit a series of milestones that have focused on operational improvements and resetting the firms image as a foundation for growth. For the first time, we were able to declare a dividend to our shareholders for 2015 and a few months ago we moved the head office to a larger and prestigious space in Colombo 03 commensurate to our progress as a company.
Gautam who is also CEO of Lanka Ashok Leyland states, we feel that it is now the time to look outwards and grow SMB Leasings geographical footprint. It has always been in the pipeline but we believe the time is right to leverage SMB leasings unique identity to a wider market. This branch opening is another step in the next phase of the SMB leasing story. We will capitalize on our long standing partnership with Lanka Ashok Leyland by earmarking several locations for branch expansion alongside or in close proximity to Lanka Ashok Leyland outlets. With so much to look forward to, I would like to extend our thanks to all our customers who have placed their faith and rewarded us thus far and give us the determination to carry forward on this journey."

Somalia piracy: India ship hijacked in new attack

Somali pirates have hijacked an Indian cargo ship off the coast of the semi-autonomous region of Puntland, officials there say.
One source said the vessel was heading towards Somali shores. There were no details of the crew or destination.
Some two weeks earlier an oil tanker en route to Mogadishu was seized by pirates who then released the boat apparently without conditions.
That incident was the first hijack off the Somali coast since 2012.
The privately-owned Daynile website said that attack happened some 50km (30 miles) south of the port town of Hobyo.
Piracy off the Somali coast - usually for ransom - has reduced significantly in recent years, in part because of extensive international military patrols as well as support for local fishing communities.
At the height of the crisis in 2011, there were 237 attacks and the annual cost of piracy wasestimated to beup to $8bn (7bn).

Sony launches slow-mo Xperia XZ Premium phone
Sony's latest smartphone is capable of filming smooth slow-motion footage at four times the rate possible on Apple and Samsung's top-end models.
The Xperia XZ Premium captures video at up to 960 frames per second (fps).
The achievement was made possible by a new type of image sensor that has built-in memory of its own.
Sony's smartphone market share is small, but it usually makes its sensors available to rivals about six to 12 months after they debut.
Apple, Samsung, LG and Xiaomi are among those to have used its technology in recent handsets.
The new phone was unveiled alongside several lower specification devices on the first day of the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona.
"Despite this being one of the best devices at MWC, I don't see it changing Sony's fortunes," commented Francisco Jeronimo, from the market research firm IDC.
"If you go through Sony's financial statements you can see it now makes more money from selling phone cameras to its competitors than selling its own smartphones, which is quite remarkable
"So, its phones are a way to show off its capabilities, and the new camera is outstanding - not just the slow-mo but also the picture quality."
Sony shipped about half as many smartphones in 2016 as the previous year and has about 1% share of the market, according to IDC, putting it in 17th place.
It uses a three-layer stacked sensor fitted with one gigabit of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). Doing so lets the component temporarily store a rapid burst of video data locally before it is transferred to other memory components, which takes more time. When the firm first announced the sensor earlier this month it said it was capable of 1,000 fps in 1080p "full high definition".
However, on the Xperia XZ Premium it has been restricted to slightly fewer frames per second at 720p resolution.
In practice, users can only capture 0.18 seconds of footage at this speed, which produces six seconds of video when played back.
But they can do so in the middle of filming normal footage to create a slow-down-and-speed-back-up effect. The challenge is to press the button at the right moment.
"It's only a very brief amount of time and you've got to be really on the ball to use it effectively," commented Tim Coulling from the Canalys tech consultancy.
The built-in DRAM memory also lets users record action that happened a second before they pressed the record button.
This buffer function is intended to help them avoid missed moments, but only works if the device detects motion, which triggers the facility.
Other unusual features include: a 5.5in (14cm) 4K resolution display that has four times as many pixels as 1080p equivalents. It also plays back Amazon Prime Video content in high dynamic range. HDR delivers more vibrant images that reveal extra detail compared to traditional footagethe choice of a mirrored body. This allows the back of the device to be used to help put on make-up or put in contact lenses. However, it also attracts fingerprint marks. BBC News

Sri Lankas friendship with China not at Indias expense: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe assured that Sri Lankas friendship with China is not at the expense of India.
Premier Wickremesinghe was responding to WIONs Senior Journalist Padma Rao Sundarji, participating in a television interview as a part of World Is One Global Leaders series.
We have always been friendly with China, but not at the expense of India. We are friendly with many countries but not at the expense of others. Our relationship with India is different from that with China. What you have to look at is our relationship vis-a-vis India and not get too worried about how we are doing with China, or the UK, or anyone else.
The Prime Minister also pointed out that the two governments are moving closely with each other and whatever that is seen as uneasiness between the two, probably would be the point of view of Indian media.
We have our good defence relationships, we have our economic relationships. We are looking at a number of projects, the Premier said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also pointed out: We are working with each other on an economic and technical cooperation agreement, one that will also lay the basis for a closer relationship between Sri Lanka and the economies of the five south Indian states which should be at least worth 500 billion US dollars.Speaking on a strong security relationship between the two countries, the PM said: There is close sharing of information. There are a lot of informal contacts between Indian ministers and our ministers, Indian officials and ours. I think this has been one of the good periods of the relationship between India and Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister added that in the previous week, the Indian and Sri Lankan Naval authorities had a discussion over lands in Hambantota that could be invested in and leased out to any industrial estate operator.
He said there is a land near Galle in which Sri Lanka would like to work together with the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation.
Sri Lanka is like any other country. Industrial land is held by the government and any interested investor can lease it to run their industrial estates. We like it because that means bringing in investors to the country. Even India is discussing an industrial estate in Sri Lanka, The Premier pointed out.
We are looking at how India can participate in Sri Lankas effort to develop the Trincomalee harbour together with Japan, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
We are both committed to seeing the success of the Bay of Bengal as an economic area. Theres a lot of potential there in the next 10 years, he said.

Success of Club Football is the key to a strong National Team - CEO Umar
Sri Lanka Football needs to work on its priorities and bring a set of complete reforms to the existing "club football structure" if the governing body wants to see some international success. Many strategies to uplift the National teams performances proved to be unsuccessful in the past for various reasons.
A complete new approach is now put forward by the New CEO of Football  Jaswar Umar and he speaks out on how our football can reach the next level.
World football is dominated by very strong Club Football Structure and club competitions. Some of these club competitions have become very strong brands in the world with high commercial values. English Premier League, La Liga, Bundasliga are to name a few. These club competitions have transformed the modern-day football into global football industry with profits, skills, millions of global fans base and football celebrities. Jaswar explained.
The success of Club Football will automatically create a strong National team. I strongly believe that supporting clubs and revamping club competitions will change the landscape of our football completely. Ever since I took this office as CEO in a short period, I have given priority to all clubs, supported every club in whatever ways possible with an approach of football first.
Every club has been treated fairly and I have listened to their issues; solved those appropriately. Every club could walk into my office without any appointment and my doors are open to them anytime.
The Football CEO explained the new plans for clubs with AFCs Club Licensing Program which will be implemented from this year.
AFC has requested all member countries to implement Club Licensing to all its clubs. This will begin from this year and made as mandatory to all member countries from 2018. Jaswar Umar who is also AFC Club Licensing Manager said, FFSL will implement the first step of club licensing this year to all to league (Champion League Clubs) as mandatory for the 2017 season.
Clubs will be assessed under Sporting Criteria, Infrastructure Criteria, Personnel and administrative Criteria, Legal Criteria and Financial Criteria.
The Club Licensing procedure will be done online with paperless environment and all clubs will be given individual access to upload their documents for approval. The online system is now ready he said.
AFC Club Licensing will make the clubs into a strong entity with financial stability and independent organization with its fan base and income sources. We want to see at least ten of our top teams become professional football clubs within the next five years. We have set a two-year target and a five-year target to these clubs.
The CEO seems to be very ambitious but says it is not an impossible task to do these reforms. AFC and FFSL have already conducted two workshops to the clubs and steps are underway for more workshops, trainings and supports for the top league clubs.
The CEO also stated that he has already made a road map for the top coaches in the country to enhance their knowledge and to provide more skills in coaching. This includes necessary support to sit for AFC A license courses, skill development program from foreign experts etc. From 2018, all top league clubs MUST have coaches with AFC license.
I will go an extra mile to support these clubs to make them as profitable football clubs.  Jaswar said. FFSL is now planning to make some strategic reforms in Club Competitions including a possible professional league structure and Club Youth League by next year.

A success story : BIA Runway Resurfacing Project
Airport and Aviation Services Limited embarked on a colossal task of resurfacing of the runway of Bandaranaike International Airport, the Sri Lankas Key international Airport, which served its service life.The most conducive dry weather patterns for the resurfacing works were considered based on the review of historical weather data at BIA maintained by the Meteorological Department. The contract for the Overlaying Works was awarded on September 1, 2016 to the Joint Venture of China National Aero Technology International Group (CATIC) and Shanghai New Era Airport Design.
Both these organisations were credited under of Civil Aviation Authority of China. The contract was to overlay the runway and construction of associated works on a design and build basis. The cost of the entire project estimated was USD 50$mn. Under the major developments of the runway project the extent of work involved as follows.
Runway of BIA is upgraded to modified Code F compliance, aerodrome Ground Lighting of the Runway and Taxiway system of BIA upgraded to CAT II as per ICAO, all of the new installation will be energy efficiency LED Light system, surface movement guidance system to the Runway and taxiway systems, new airfield light control and monitoring system, all Runway markings as per ACI new addition, and capacity of Runway system will be enhanced to meet next 20 year growth
Further, the runway width has been expanded by 15 meters, (7.5 meters from both side) enabling A380 aircraft to land successfully.
The Netherlands Airport Consultants (NACO), design and supervision consultant, was the design and supervision consultant of the runway when it was constructed and commissioned under the Phase 1 Development Project of Colombo International Airport in 1986.
The runway was closed for operations from 8.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. considering comparatively low traffic volumes during the period as well as to minimise passenger inconvenience. Well proactive planning by the Design & Planning Division in close coordination with Air Traffic Control Division, Airport Management Division, Electrical Engineering Division and other relevant divisions of the Airport Aviation Services Limited, the Civil Aviation Authority, Srilankan Airline, AOC, Government Agencies among others. led to create a detailed spontaneous commercially feasible operation during the construction.The construction of the overlay works commenced on schedule on January 6, 2017. Daunting task of operations during this period was managed while ensuring correct level of security and safety within the airport premises with the least hassle to the passengers, airlines and cargo operations.
Seeing the national requirement, a remarkable service was comprehended by all stakeholders. The Customs, Immigration, Srilankan Airlines, AOC, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Police Katunayake/BIA, State Intelligence Service (SIS) , Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and the Foreign Employment Bureau. The exemplified combine collaboration of the agencies made it clear that the aviation industry of Sri Lanka had no barriers in accomplishing great feats. The collective work synergy is the result of the main runway being ready for 24 hour operation even before estimated date of April 5, 2017. The Overlay complete and BIA grandeur in order in facilitating all operations.
It is important to note an updated rescheduled staff roster duties facilitated all 16 immigration departure counters to be operational during the construction period whilst two Fast Track Immigration counters created passengers check-in within one hour from the departure. During the period of Runway closure, both inbound and out bound aircraft traffic movements were accommodated by Sri Lankas two other international airports. The Matala Rajapaksha International Airport (MRIA) and the Colombo Airport Ratmalana (RMA) were fully geared in facilitating connectivity of airlines during this period. All business jet aircraft movements during the closure were handled by the Colombo Airport, Ratmalana.
As the sole ground handler, SriLankan Airlines played a dedicated role on all ground handling operations by deploying their skilled ground handlers. Specialised equipment were utilised in all three international airports for the purpose.
The services of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation were also crucial in facilitating quick turn-around time in keeping with the scheduled departures. Work efficiency by their part led to crucial ground services being fulfilled on time.
The procedure for safety evaluation for closing and re-opening of the runway was carried out by the contractor. This procedure was also evaluated by the consultants and the AASL safety team and submitted to the DGCA for the approval. The Civil Aviation Authority closely monitored approval procedures are being followed upon and whether resurfacing standards are being met. All the procedures implemented during the construction are going to be the same in order to enhance the efficiency of the airport operations and this is one of the most successful projects in the region of this nature.
To ensure efficient security clearance process, the Sri Lanka Air Force was well organised by assigning adequate personnel for baggage screening in all screening points and by providing additional scanners to ensure that aircraft and passengers are fully screened with no breach of security.
Police Station Katunayake/BIA has done a very premeditated plan for handling all arriving and departing vehicles in order to avoid congestion at the entrance to the airport and long lanes of vehicles along the approach. All these were a success since the traffic plan was introduced within the airport premises and was tested two weeks prior to the Runway closure.
Both MRIA and RMA was very well utilised during the runway closure period to handle flights within their current capacities. The Colombo Airport, Ratmalana has been attracted by many smaller aircraft during this period and made arrangements for smooth passenger operations. In addition to that, facilities provided at the airport also attracted more commercial flights.
Availability of the Mattala International Airport (MRIA) round the clock for operations ensured airline to easily divert their flights to the MRIA as a destination and Terminating point. The MRIA was fully equipped to accommodate any airline that wished to operate there for connectivity and for technical stopovers during the period.
When the number of passenger movements at the BIA is concerned, it has been noticed that the difference of the reduction of passengers handled has been only 5.25 percent between January and February in 2016 and 2017. When the aircraft movements are concerned, it has been noticed that the difference of the reduction of aircraft handled in the same period this year and last year has been around 16.7 percent. Therefore, when considering the importance of the runway resurfacing and its expected future economic benefits for the country, this has not made a considerable negative impact to the countrys economy.
It has been noticed that the passengers sacrificed their precious time and had offered their fullest cooperation for the AASL to carry out all the processing activities most efficiently bearing all the temporary discomfort for the national priority. The AASL management is pleased to observe the enthusiasm of their staff and staff of other entities during the special operational period without any hesitation.
Airport Aviation Sri Lanka Limited Chairman Eng. Saman Ediriweera, Vice Chairman Ranjith De Silva, Executive Director Johanne Jayarathne and all the heads of the divisions were able to undertake this successful project under the guidelines and blessings of Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva and Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe.

To make the message relevant, the insight used was the deep rooted cultural understanding of Sri Lankan masks associated with after life.
Thus, masks made out of chads re-iterated that even the smallest piece of paper could be recycled and given a new life.
Competing among Asias best is no easy task. In the Media category, to be placed among the 35 metal recipients from 250 entries is an honor. It proves that insight driven ideas stand the test.

Thai company plans FTZ in Bandaragama
A Thailand based infrastructure company famous for setting up Economic Zones is planning to set up a Free Trade Zone (FTZ) in Bandaragama, said Deputy Director General, Board of Investments of Sri Lanka Dumunda Ariyasinghe.
Speaking at the 37th annual general meeting of the Free Trade Zone Manufactures Association (FTZMA) in Katunayake last Friday he said that they have already began discussions with this company. We met senior officials from this company when when BOI officials were in Thailand and they will now visit Sri Lanka soon, he said.
Ariyasinghe said that the company in Thailand has set up many Free Trade Zones all over the world and were planning to open another in Myanmar. But due to red tape they have now decided to halt that operation. Its this investment that we want to bring to Sri Lanka, he said.
He added that the Thai company first obtains the land from the government on a long term lease and then invest on the infrastructure. The biggest advantage of this project is that when the company completes the infrastructure and is ready to open they would bring in around 25 investors with them creation over 5,000 employment opportunities from the day the zone is opened.
Ariyasinghe said when the zone opens there would be international standard infrastructure available. In addition there would be over 20 foreign investors doing projects. These factors will give investor confidence for more international investors to set up factories there.
He said that the government is now in the process of identifying around 400 acres for this project in the Bandaragama area.
Meanwhile addressing another issue that was brought up at the AGM with regard to the reintroduction of SVAT he said that he would set up a meeting with Minister of Finance to talk about this.
I am now made aware that with the re-introduction of SVAT around 16% export money would be retained by Customs and this would deprive them of working capital and this is an issue that needs to be discussed again.
The Director General said that though the FDI were low the future looks very bright as several top foreign investors are now keen to set up business in Sri Lanka soon. The response we had from our overseas marketing campaigns were positive, he added.

Tots teetering in heels!
Growing up, many of us honed our love of getting dolled up thanks to stylishly-attired mums and older sisters.
Badly applied lipstick, bangles stacked to the elbow, dousing ourselves in perfume and stomping around in adult-sized heels - these are all part and parcel of playing dress-up.
Its not for every child but many do seem to have a magpie-like fondness for their mums shoes, clothes and accessories.
Now one company based in Pennsylvania have cut out the middle mum and come up with dinky baby-sized high heels! Of course, theres a big difference between your little one donning a pair of your heels for a few minutes once in a while and actually buying them a pair to wear regularly.
As much as you might be OK with the former, were also warned about the damage high heels can do to our feet. So what makes these a good idea
According to founder Michelle Holbrook, Pee Wee Pumps have been made for babies - and with their developing feet in mind. Yes, dont worry - your bundle of joy wont be taking their first steps in a nice pair of courts.
Described as infant crib shoes, the designs are described as flexible and soft - and the heel is collapsible. And it seems the idea existed before Pee Wee Pumps. Michelle took inspiration from a pair of crib shoes she saw before falling pregnant with her daughter.
However, after tracking the shoes down Michelle found they would not stay on her baby daughters feet, and she set about coming up with a design more suited to babies.
Should fashion statements be earned with age Baby heels have opinion divided.
On the one hand, they dont do any harm to a childs foot in the way our high heels have done to ours. But there is a counter-argument that the very design is another example of children growing up too fast.

Towards a beautiful garden
Getting a healthy and beautiful lawn and garden isn't rocket science, but it does take time, patience and the right information. Here are some useful tips to maintain a beautiful garden.
For healthy grass, adjust your soil pH
Soil pH (acidity level) is very important, and just because your dirt looks rich and black doesn't mean it's the right pH for grass. Take samples around the yard and send them to your local extension service for testing. You can fix soil pH problems by adding lime to raise the pH or iron to lower it. Most grasses prefer a pH of 6.0 to 7.2.
Grass in shade has different needs than grass in sun
People tend to overapply fertilizer to shady areas because the grass is struggling. But that just kills it faster! A lawn in full sun and a shaded lawn that may get only two to four hours of direct sun have different water and fertilizer needs. The grass in shady areas needs less water because less evaporates, and it needs less fertilizer because with less sun it doesn't grow as much. When you go into shade, shift the controls on the spreader so you're spreading about half the amount. Consider a tree's final height and width when planting
Before you buy a tree, look at the shade pattern it'll have when it's grown. You're going to start with this cute little tree, and it's going to look good when you plant it near the house, but once it grows up, it's going to be a problem with the roof and gutters.
Healthy soil means fewer weeds
Lawns that are nutrient-stressed are a breeding ground for weeds, so the best defense is a healthy lawn. Test the soil to see what type and quantity of fertilizer are needed to help your lawn. Proper fertilization improves lawn health, so grass can compete better and crowd out weeds without a lot of weed killer.
Ground covers control erosion and weeds
Ground covers are an easy way to soften rock features and patios or control erosion on slopes. If the soil's good, kill the existing vegetation and leave it in place on the slope to stabilize the bank and serve as mulch. Then plant through the layer of dead material. Add another layer of shredded bark or other mulch after planting to conserve moisture and reduce weed problems while your ground cover becomes established.
Tailor products and advice to your yard
One-size-fits-all doesn't work for fertilizer, weed killer and grass seed, even though that's what the chain stores sell. Lawn products that work great in Georgia clay may not be good for Kansas or Oregon. The best way to find out about growing conditions in your area and what to put on your lawn, and when, is to talk to a local garden center or your agricultural extension service.
Plastic edging works well on curves
Plastic edging will go up and down hills as long as you spike it in well, but over time, straight lines will get a little wavy.
Use shredded mulch around plants
Rock mulch will reflect heat back into shrubs and heat up shallow roots, so it's not as good for the health of the plant. Shredded mulch holds moisture better and stays cooler.
Use a mulching mower
As long as at least a quarter of the grass is still showing through the leaves, you can mulch the leaves with your mower. But if the lawn is 80 to 90 percent covered, you'd better rake some of it up. That much mulch creates too much residue, it won't degrade well, and in spring it'll be a matted mess that kills the grass.
Top dress with cedar or cypress mulch
If you're mulching a big area, use a cheaper hardwood mulch for most of it, then top-dress it with cedar or cypress. You can also top-dress old, ratty-looking mulchjust sprinkle on a fresh 1-inch layer and it'll look brand new. That way you're not paying for something you don't see.
Protect trees with mulch
Mulch protects trees from mower wounds
Protect exposed tree roots at the surface of the yard by mulching around the root area. A 2- to 4-inch layer of wood chips or shredded bark protects the roots and creates a good growing environment. Planting grass right up to a tree trunk is a common practice, but it's not good for the tree because grass and trees compete for water and nutrients. The tree will be healthier and grow faster if you put a 3- to 4-ft. border of mulch around it instead of grass.

Trump ready to 'solve' North Korea problem without China

Donald Trump has said the United States will "solve" the nuclear threat from North Korea, with or without China's help.
"If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will. That is all I am telling you," he said in an interview with UK paper Financial Times.
Pressed on whether he thought he could succeed alone, he replied: "Totally."
Trump was speaking ahead of a scheduled visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.
"China has great influence over North Korea. And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won't. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don't it won't be good for anyone," Trumptold the FT.
Asked if he meant "one-on-one" unilateral action, Trump said: "I don't have to say any more. Totally."
He did not give any further details on what action he would take.
Trump's brief comments, published just days before the key meeting with Xi at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday, are the latest in a series of warnings over North Korea's nuclear development.
There are fears that Pyongyang could eventually develop the ability to launch long-range nuclear missiles capable of striking the mainland United States.
During a trip to Asia in March, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson saidpre-emptive military action was an option"on the table".
A month earlier, Defence Secretary James Mattis warned that any use of nuclear weaponswould be met with an "overwhelming" response.
China - which is North Korea's only international ally - has taken action in light of the reclusive nation'slatest missile tests.
In February, itbanned coal imports from North Korea until the end of 2017, cutting a major source of cash income for Pyongyang.
But Trump is expected to pressure China's president to do much more at their meeting this week - and he has implied that the issue of trade could be used as leverage.
The president told the Financial Times that "trade is the incentive. It is all about trade." But he said he did not plan to discuss tariffs during the meeting.
At the end of March, he signed two executive orders to deal with the US trade deficit, reviewing current rules and foreign trade abuses.
White House officials insisted China was not the focus of his orders - but it is the largest source of the US trade deficit, accounting for about $347bn (276bn) a year, out of a total of $502bn (400bn).
And Trump himselftweeted that"the meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits".
Trump has not said how he will negotiate trade with China while also pressuring them to influence Pyongyang.
Analysts sayChina has maintained its support for Pyongyang as it fears a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with US soldiers based in a country with a land border with China.
It is thought that China is also concerned at the prospect of millions of North Korean refugees entering its borders.

Unnamed Caves
Over the past few decades, in Tennessee, archaeologists have unearthed an elaborate cave-art tradition thousands of years old. The pictures are found in dark-zone sitesplaces where the Native American people who made the artwork did so at personal risk, crawling meters or, in some cases, miles underground with cane torchesas opposed to sites in the twilight zone, speleologists jargon for the stretch, just beyond the entry chamber, which is exposed to diffuse sunlight. A pair of local hobby cavers, friends who worked for the U.<U+2009>S. Forest Service, found the first of these sites in 1979.
Theyd been exploring an old root cellar and wriggled up into a higher passage. The walls were covered in a thin layer of clay sediment left there during long-ago floods and maintained by the caves unchanging temperature and humidity. The stuff was still soft. It looked at first as though someone had finger-painted all over, maybe a childthe men debated even saying anything. But the older of them was a student of local history. He knew some of those images from looking at drawings of pots and shell ornaments that emerged from the fields around there: bird men, a dancing warrior figure, a snake with horns. Here were naturalistic animals, too: an owl and turtle. Some of the pictures seemed to have been first made and then ritually mutilated in some way, stabbed or beaten with a stick.
That was the discovery of Mud Glyph Cave, which was reported all over the world and spawned a book and a National Geographic article. No one knew quite what to make of it at the time. The caves closest parallel, reported the Christian Science Monitor, may be caves in the south of France which contain Ice Age art. A team of scholars converged on the site.
The glyphs, they determinedby carbon-dating charcoal from half-burned slivers of canewere roughly eight hundred years old and belonged to the Mississippian people, ancestors to many of todays Southeastern and Midwestern tribes. The imagery was classic Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (SECC), meaning it belonged to the vast but still dimly understood religious outbreak that swept the Eastern part of North America around 1200 a.d. We know something about the art from that period, having seen all the objects taken from graves by looters and archaeologists over the years: effigy bowls and pipes and spooky-eyed, kneeling stone idols; carved gorgets worn by the elite. But these underground paintings were something new, an unknown mode of Mississippian cultural activity. The caves perpetually damp walls had preserved, in the words of an iconographer who visited the site, an artistic tradition which has left us few other traces.
That was written twenty-five years ago, and today there are more than seventy known dark-zone cave sites east of the Mississippi, with new ones turning up every year. A handful of the sites contain only some markings or cross-hatching (lusus Indorum was the antiquarians term: the Indians whimsy), but others are quite elaborate, much more so than Mud Glyph. Several are older, too. One of them, the oldest so far, was created around 4,000 b.c. The sites range from Missouri to Virginia, and from Wisconsin to Florida, but the bulk lie in Middle Tennessee. Of those, the greater number are on the Cumberland Plateau, which runs at a southwest slant down the eastern part of the state, like a great wall dividing the Appalachians from the interior.
Thats what it was, for white settlers who wanted to cross it in wagons. If you read about Daniel Boone and the Cumberland Gap, and how excited everyone got in the eighteenth century to have found a natural pass (known, incidentally, to every self-respecting Indian guide) through the Cumberland Mountains, those writers mean the Plateau.

Unravelling the world of the autistic child
Yesterday, Sunday April 2, 2017 was World Autism Awareness Day. This will be the ninth time the celebrations are held since the United Nations General Assembly designated it through a resolution.
Autism is a big concern globally and those affected either directly or indirectly suffer many challenges. This has prompted individuals and groups to come together in different parts of the world to form autism organisations.
These organisations come together in different parts of the globe once a year to commemorate World Autism Awareness day. The events include special actions aimed at raising awareness and raising funds in unique ways. Even with these annual celebrations, many people around the world still do not understand all there is to know about autism.
Unique needs
Autism is a spectrum disorder, meaning that there is a wide degree of variation in the way it affects people. Every child on the autism spectrum has unique abilities, symptoms, and challenges. Learning about the different autism spectrum disorders will help you better understand your own child, get a handle on what all the different autism terms mean, and make it easier to communicate with the doctors, teachers, and therapists helping your child.
It must be reiterated that Autism is not a single disorder, but a spectrum of closely related disorders with a shared core of symptoms. Every individual on the autism spectrum has problems to some degree with social skills, empathy, communication, and flexible behaviour. But the level of disability and the combination of symptoms varies enormously from person to person. In fact, two kids with the same diagnosis may look very different when it comes to their behaviour and abilities.
If you are a parent dealing with a child on the autism spectrum, you may hear many different terms including high-functioning autism, atypical autism, autism spectrum disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder. These terms can be confusing, not only because there are so many, but because doctors, therapists, and other parents may use them in dissimilar ways.
Part of the reason it is so hard to separate mental illnesses from autism is that autism is still not fully understood and appears different in each person. One persons autism is nothing like another persons autism. What it means is that a programme, classroom, therapy or social group event that works beautifully for one autistic person may be an utter disaster for another person with the identical diagnosis.
But no matter what doctors, teachers, and other specialists call the autism spectrum disorder, its your childs unique needs that are truly important. No diagnostic label can tell you exactly what challenges your child will have. Finding treatment that addresses your childs needs, rather than focusing on what to call the problem, is the most helpful thing you can do. You dont need a diagnosis to start getting help for your childs symptoms.
A neurological disorder
In both children and adults, the signs and symptoms of the autism spectrum disorders include problems with social skills, speech and language, and restricted activities and interests. However, there are enormous differences when it comes to the severity of the symptoms, their combinations, and the patterns of behaviour.
Keep in mind that just because your child has a few autism-like symptoms, it doesnt mean he or she has an autism spectrum disorder.
The autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed based on the presence of multiple symptoms that disrupt your childs ability to communicate, form relationships, explore, play, and learn.
Whether its at school, work or in social settings, people with autism are often misconceived.
They often suffer discrimination, intolerance and isolation, resulting in many feeling excluded from everyday society.
Various expert studies agree in accord and shatter the myth that autism is not, repeat not, a mental health disorder. Rather it is a neurological disorder. Studies of the people with autism have revealed abnormalities in brain structure and neurotransmitter levels. Part of the reason it is so hard to separate mental illnesses from autism is that autism is still not fully understood and looks different in each person.
A different turn
Yet, how do we comfort the parents of such children who have been through the Autism spectrum disorder diagnosis. However well-intentioned comments that were meant to comfort can sometimes cut like a knife! Yet what do you say to parents carrying such a cross Even with the right to be wary you must never bring yourself to say the wrong things. No you dont blurt out that you are sorry! Because that sometimes makes things worse
You dont say youre sorry because these people dont want to be pitied. And it makes things worse not better. While for many of them the life after diagnosis will be different, it is not less. While their child might miss out on some things, he or she is not considered less. You dont say to these parents, Hell be fine. ASD is very complex and no two journeys are the same. One parent told me: Even as a mother of a child with autism I am very hesitant to give advice, as I know my sons autism is not your childs autism.
We should all know better than to say Really He seems so normal. Those phrases do not comfort, they simply insert an opinion when our opinion was not asked. Parents facing an ASD diagnosis do not want unsolicited advice or pity. They do not want you to minimize their feelings or give false hope.
They want you to listen. They want you to care. They want you to stay in their lives and not brand them as special needs parents. They want you to understand that although their lives might be taking a different turn, they still need friends.
Their children still need friends and subtle support.
Then what the heck do you say to these people Sure as a counsellor I too was at a loss for words. Even as a professional wordsmith I could not find the right words. Then like a bolt from the blue it came to me. The two simple and perfect words you can say: Im here. And mean it. Mean it through every struggle, every victory and every passing day.
Mean it on the days when autism is all they can talk about and on the days when they need an extra set of hands. Mean it when you are making out the list of which children to invite to your childs birthday party.
They dont need you to be an expert on autism. They dont need you to always say the right thing. Now, more than ever, they need you to just be there.

Unusual burial requests
A woman whose dying wish was to be buried with her partners peacemaker is among the bizarre final requests dealt with by a firm of UK solicitors. Another client asked to be cremated and laid to rest with the ashes of her beloved cat. And a third insisted on seeing her relatives heart to make sure she was dead when she was buried.
Lawyer Michael Smoult, from will specialists Gorvins Solicitors, said: We have had clients who, in their wills, have wanted to be shot into the sky on a rocket or have their ashes spread across a popular beach so that people will  as they have put it  lie on them.
One lady even asked if her body could be frozen in liquid nitrogen and then shattered into a million pieces using sound waves so that she would be crumbled into powder and then stored in a corn starch coffin where the remains would turn into compost.
And while these things are possible, not all relatives will agree.
He says funerals are increasingly becoming flash points as relatives argue over how they should bid farewell to their loved ones.
On one occasion mediation over the final resting place of the ashes broke down, and one party flushed them down the toilet in spite.
The most important thing is to specify your wishes in a will, stating as much detail as possible, he said.
Make sure you appoint an executor who will be sensitive enough to understand what you want and, though its a little morbid, if you can, discuss these with them in advance. So there are no shocks and an understanding that wishes are realistic.
Funeral prices have soared 10 times as fast as the cost of living in just a year. The average funeral in the UK now costs 3,897  more than double the figure it was in 2004.

Vasus trial balloon
Joint Opposition firebrand Vasudeva Nanayakkaras call to President Maithripala Sirisena, that, should the latter ditch the UNP, they, of the JO, would be willing to form a government with the SLFP component of the current regime, should be viewed as yet another attempt to get those currently being investigated for mega scams and other crimes off the hook. Vasus, of course, is the latest voice in this regard. There have also been others, too, of the JO, who make the same suggestion from time to time, notably Messrs. Kumara Welgama and Prasanna Ranatunga both of whom have cases pending against them. MP Dullas Alahapperuma too has been a vociferous advocate for such a course. Such an arrangement would not only stand the JO in good stead from the point of view having the cases against their stalwarts dropped but would also open up other possibilities.
Many of the JO members were once Cabinet Ministers and a new government formed with their former SLFP colleagues, will, no doubt, present them the opportunity to be Ministers once again. Not only that. A realignment of forces would necessarily make Mahinda Rajapaksa the Prime Minister while investigations currently being made against the numerous felonies of JO stalwarts would come to an abrupt end.
However Vasus suggestion coming to fruition has the chance of a snowball in hell. To begin with, the UNP still commands a majority in parliament and a minority government, as suggested by the MP, would be a non-starter. There is also good reasons for the President not to be enamoured by such a suggestion. Having queered the pitch of MR becoming PM at the last general election it is next to impossible that President Sirisena will have a change of heart in this regard. One recalls the statement made by the President that had Rajapaksa won the election he (President) would have been six feet below terra firma.
Those advocating a realignment should also factor in the ground realities. Joint Opposition members have been vociferous critics of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe government on almost all fronts and accused it carrying out a witch-hunt against the war heroes. It has also taken to the streets decrying the many agreements signed by government and those that are in the pipeline. Does the likes of Vasudeva Nanayakkara expect a government formed with the JO to jettison the Hambantota port development agreement signed with the Chinese or the Public Private partnership to be shortly entered into bailout the national carrier Will the new government, formed with the JO component, do away with ECTA and abolish SAITM, two issues it obviously cannot compromise on, after going to town attacking the government. Can Nanayakkara explain how a government devoid of the UNP can suddenly become the best thing that has happened to this country, with members in its fold having the most regressive and obsolete ideas, not in tune with the modern world
Does a government that includes the JO, to the exclusion of the UNP, drop the constitution making exercise, now in an advanced stage, with people like Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa protesting furiously that it contained clauses that will divide the country What will become of the agreement signed between the SLFP and UNP to continue the alliance for the duration of the unity government What will become of the newly formed Pohottuwa party led by the Prof. G.L. Peiris as the fall back option for the JO Will the party be disbanded if the JO is accommodated in the government
It is not known if Nanayakkara is flying a trial balloon at the behest of his leader Mahinda Rajapaksa. For MR has so far not come out in the open advocating such a course but has been a vocal critic of the government, vowing to have nothing to do with it.
Be that as it may, President Sirisena will be the last person to accommodate the Joint Opposition in the government, and for good reasons. He is well aware of the viscous attacks made against him, even at a personal level, by the personages in Joint Opposition who are today clamouring to work with him by forming a government. He also cannot be unaware that there are scores to settle with him by the Rajapaksas, not just for his betrayal in decamping at the eleventh hour to take on MR but also having the spunk to throw some of the Rajapaksa family members behind bars. Besides, President Sirisena cannot let down the civil society groups, the Good Governance advocates and the combined forces who put their shoulders to the wheel to ensure his victory and rid the country of a corrupt regime, with former President Chandrika Kumaratunga in the vanguard of the campaign. Most of all, he cannot be ungrateful to the UNP through whose votes he rode to power and whose members made tremendous sacrifices to install him in office. Besides, the unity government is too far gone down the road for a turnaround at this juncture.

The Colombo Fort Magistrate this morning rejected the second bail application made by National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa.

The vehicles that were released for the use of friends and family had incurred the government an estimated loss of Rs. 91 million.
Weerawansa was arrested on January 9.
He began a hunger strike in protest of the Court of Appeal rejection of his bail application on March 21.

Western, Central, Southern provinces top the list
Schools in the Western, Central and Southern Provinces top the list with regard to human rights violation complaints received on Grade One admissions, said Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission Chairman Dr Deepika Udugama. She said repeated complaints are received against some of these schools every year. Addressing a press conference at the Keppetipola hall, Kandy Dr Udugama said 80 complaints had been received against schools in the Central Province this year.
A report had been submitted to the Education Ministry after conducting investigations into them. Separate investigations are being held in respect of each school and principals are informed about them.
Dr Udugama said most human rights complaints are received against the police, education sector and against the administration.
Referring to parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansas question, she said it cannot be considered as a subject for a human rights violation case. A human rights case could be filed if it was concerning an executive or administrative injustice.
Granting of bail was a decision of court and the Human Rights Commission had no powers to act on judicial decisions.

What happened to literary politicians
George Osborne, the next editor of the Evening Standard, doesnt have much professional experience of journalism  apart from a few weeks on The Times in 1993, after he left Oxford. Soon after, he left for Conservative Central Office, and you know what happened next. He did, though, do some student journalism at University as co-Editor of Isis magazine. I know because I was the Isis joint features editor at the time  as indeed was the present TLS History Editor.
I cant pretend it was groundbreaking journalism. Osborne wrote a piece, Spies Like Us, about Oxfords espionage history. He wrote another article, Greed, Desperation and the Tuesday Game, about Britains four leading poker players. Even that was higher brow than one of my contributions  Around the World in 80 Lays, the tale of Anne Cummings, a widely-travelled, octogenarian nymphomaniac.
As well as his six well-documented jobs, Osborne is also writing a book, The Age of Unreason, about the crisis in democracy and capitalism. David Cameron, too, is currently composing his memoirs. Neither of them, though, could claim to be a literary politician  a figure that has vanished off the face of the Earth. Its not that they arent clever. Osborne was a history Demy  the word for a scholar at Magdalen College  and Cameron got a First in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Brasenose. Its just that the days when MPs, Chancellors of the Exchequer and Prime Ministers were writers and intellectuals have gone.
Why has the literary politician disappeared Partly, its a time thing. Politicians have much less spare time these days than they did even half a century ago. Yes, Osborne has now got enough spare moments for those six jobs  but he didnt have them when he was Chancellor of the Exchequer. Being Chancellor is a demanding job, and the public expect it to be a demanding job.
That expectation of the professional, 24-7 politician wasnt there in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The last proper intellectual Prime Minister was Arthur Balfour, in Downing Street from 1902 until 1905. Balfour may not have been a great Prime Minister, but he was a serious philosopher. His series of Gifford Lectures in 1914 at Glasgow University, on Theism and Humanism, were published as a book in 1915. C. S. Lewis said it was one of the ten books that influenced him most.
Going a little further back, Gladstone wrote a three-volume, heavyweight book, Studies on Homer and the Homeric Age, 1858, before he became Prime Minister. Even when he was in Downing Street, he wrote Juventus Mundi: The gods and men of the heroic age (1869), a 577-page book. In that same administration, from 186874, he was hard at work on research for another classical book, Homeric Synchronism: An enquiry into the time and place of Homer (1876).
Late nineteenth-century politics was immersed in classical scholarship. When John Morley, Gladstones biographer, was reaching for an analogy for the Prime Minister remaining in office in his mid-eighties, he turned to the ancient Homeric leader, Nestor, King of Pylos  110 years old when he fought in the Trojan War. Describing the ancient Gladstone, Morley quoted from The Iliad, Book One, and expected his readers to recognize the quotation: Two generations of mortal men had he already seen pass away, who with him of old had been born and bred in sacred Pylos, and among the third generation, he held rule. There was a stage when Gladstones Homer obsession got so great that it caused worries in the press. He was forced to write a letter to the Spectator, denying the suggestion that he began every day with his old friend, Homer.
Shades of Osborne, there, perhaps  with the implication that Gladstone wasnt spending enough time on politics. But theres quite a difference between a Homer addiction and Osbornes job for BlackRock, the biggest fund manager in the world. And the big difference is money. Gladstone lived in an age where politicians werent paid. It was only in 1911 that MPs first got a salary, of 400. Until then, politics was largely a rich mans game. The same rich man who was prepared to devote unpaid time to politics often devoted time to intellectual books, with no expectation of generous royalties.
Harold Macmillan was perhaps the last Prime Minister with the time and inclination to read erudite literature  he was helped, both intellectually and financially, by the family publishing business. He was also the last Conservative Prime Minister to get a First at Oxford before David Cameron  albeit in the early part of his Classics degree, not his Finals. Macmillan had to leave Balliol in 1914, curtailing his undergraduate studies, to fight in the war. When he was wounded at the Somme in 1916, he took refuge in a slit trench for ten hours, consoling himself with Aeschylus, in the original Greek.
Even though Osborne and Cameron, like Macmillan, are from well-off backgrounds, they belong to a generation of middle-class London professionals who have never worked so hard to keep a roof above their heads. Not much time for Aeschylus, then.
I grew up in Islington in the 1970s, where relaxed academics and poets could afford to live in double-fronted Georgian villas. Today, those same houses are occupied by Stakhanovite bankers and lawyers. Not only has the pay of those bankers and lawyers soared over the past forty years, but the relative earnings of academics and poets have also slumped. In 1960, a professor at Liverpool University was paid more than a striker at Liverpool Football Club. Admittedly, that was before the footballers maximum wage ended in 1961.
All the same, things have changed. The sort of ambitious types who want to become politicians and live in London just dont have the time, and cant afford, to write the sort of difficult books that wont sell. When politicians do write books today, they are lucrative books, with huge advances. David Cameron was paid a reported 800,000 for his memoirs; Barack and Michelle Obama got a reported $60m between them. Even when politicians arent writing about themselves, they are writing big-advance biographies of other big-name politicians: whether its Boris Johnson on Winston Churchill, or William Hague on William Pitt. They arent the first politicians to do big-name biographies. Roy Jenkins, a generation younger than Macmillan, had patrician tastes in food and wine, but only semi-intellectual tastes in his writing. His biographical subjects included Churchill, Gladstone, Truman, Baldwin and Asquith  hardly obscure subjects, written about in an engaging but non-academic, non-literary style.
Boris Johnson and William Hague are both extremely clever men. They could have become academics if theyd wanted to. They are both now rich men, and could afford to write abstruse academic books or literary fiction  again, if they wanted to. Johnson did, in fact, write a novel, Seventy-Two Virgins, in 2005  a political thriller which, with melancholy echoes today, revolves around Islamist terrorists and Parliamentary security. It didnt sell nearly as well as his Churchill biography.
Publishers once shelled out big advances for low-selling literary fiction, subsidising those advances with the profits from blockbusters. Those days have gone. It isnt just politicians who are likely to be less literary in a high-minded sense; its writers, too. Kingsley and Martin Amis were once both asked if theyd go on writing if they knew that no one would buy a single copy. They knew that the noble answer was yes. They were both honest enough to say no. All the modern financial and sociological pressures mean that any ambitious young man or woman in a hurry  aka any aspiring politician  will not devote time to writing, unless it is writing for a lot of money.

World well aware of FMs achievements: Chief Prelates
The economic development agenda of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake is envied by certain factions of Sri Lanka but it has been recognised well at international level, the Chief Prelates of the Malwathu and the Asgiri Chapters said.
The two chief prelates said Minister Karunanayake is engaged in a specific mission in economic building in the country.
The two Mahanayaka Theras expressed these views when the Finance Minister paid courtesy calls on the Theras after paying homage to the Sacred Temple of the Tooth in Kandy on April 1.
The minister told the Chief Prelate of the Asgiri Chapter the Most Venerable Warakagoda Gnanarathana Thera that he visited the Thera last year to obtain counselling in preparing Budget 2017, and the advice provided by the Nayake Thera helped immensely to present a successful national budget. He said such counselling guided him to prepare a budget that strengthen the countrys economy. The Minister provided details on the proposed development projects for the Kandy city and explained in detail about the proposed underpass to minimise increasing traffic in the city and, the development project which is centred on the Bogambara Old Prison complex. He further said that the advice of the Mahanayaka Theras are always sought before commencing any development work and the blessings of the Mahanayaka Theras are of paramount importance in these massive development work.
Minister Karunanayake who presented The Banker award, which was conferred on him after being selected as the Best Finance Minister of Asia Pacific Region, to the Nayake Thera for admiration, said that it is more an award won by the country rather than his personal achievement.
Speaking to the delegation, the Malwathu Maha Viharaya Chief Prelate Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said although a certain faction of this country is not prepared to admit the value of the Finance Minister, the International community has recognised it. Clear evidence to this is the The Banker magazines selection of Minister Karunanayake as the best Finance Minister of the Asia Pacific, The Nayake Thera said. Export Promotions and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, Central Provincial Governor Niluka Ekanayake, Finance Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga and several others participated.

WrestleMania 33 results: The Undertaker retires after losing to Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar beats Goldberg

The Undertaker bowed out of theWWEon an emotional night for fans as he appeared to pass the torch on to Roman Reigns, with the legend suffering only his second ever defeat atWrestleManiaafter an incredible 27-year career in the WWE.
The Undertaker went into the match with Reigns having lost to only Brock Lesnar during his incredible WrestleMania record, but having also won 23 matches since his debut in 1987, this defeat by Reigns looks set to be his last.
Having landed both a chokeslam and a tombstone on Reigns, Undertaker looked on course for another gruelling victory, only for Reigns to kick out. What followed was a brutal ending to his career, with Reigns dishing out three spears, two superman punches and one final, era-ending spear.
After the loss, The Undertaker removed his gloves, his coat and his hat, and made his way back along the entrance ramp visibly emotional, having taken his time to take in everything around him, to apparently retire as the greatest wrestler the WWE has seen.
For Reigns meanwhile, the fact that he ended Undertakers career is unlikely to do him any favours with the WWE Universe. Despite it being an obvious passing of the torch by the WWE, Reigns put in a disappointing, error-strewn display, as he twice botched an attempted tombstone counter and also messed up the ending to the match, and compared to some of the other eye-catching displays at WrestleMania, you wonder if it was the right decision.
One of the most spine-tingling WWE returns also took place at WrestleMania 33 as the Hardy Boys, Jeff and Matt, made a stunning comeback to now only thrill the fans in attendance at the Camping World Stadium in Orlando, but win the Raw Tag Team titles in a brutal Fatal Four-Way match.
In what was supposed to be a Triple Threat match between Enzo Amore and Big Cass, Cesaro and Sheamus and defending champions Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows, all three teams walked out to the ring for the ladder match to begin.
However, WrestleMania 33 hosts The New Day quickly interfered to confirm that the match had been expanded to four teams. After the Hardy Boys made their way down to the ring to a raucous reception, a fascinating match took place as each team got their hands on the belts, which were suspended high above the ring.
Once Anderson was taken out by a Twist of Fate off the top of the ladder, Jeff once again left the WWE Universe stunned as he delivered a Swanton Bomb off a 20-foot ladder to put Cesaro and Sheamus through two ladders suspended between the ring and the fan barricade. That cleared the way for Matt to scale the ladder, and pull down the two tag team titles to ensure the Hardys made an incredible and triumphant return to the WWE.
Seth Rollins released two years of frustration on Triple H in an unsanctioned match between former mentor and pupil, with The Architect attempting to fight back from his second serious knee injury that kept him out of last years WrestleMania.
Rollins would prove the high-flying thriller that has made him one of the crowd favourites, but Triple H repeatedly attacked the bad knee to keep him grounded. In a match that saw both chairs and a sledgehammer used, Triple H looked to be on his way to victory, only for Triple Hs wife, Stephanie McMahon, to interfere by snatching the sledgehammer off Rollins on the ring apron.
Triple H promptly charged towards his opponent, who moved, and despite stopping himself, Rollins kicked Triple H into his wife, sending her off the apron and crashing through a table at ringside. Stunned by his actions, Triple H turned straight into a Pedigree to give Rollins the victory.
The Universal Championship was on the line too, but that was not the story as Goldberg and Brock Lesnar met for just the third time in singles competition. Having won their Survivor Series clash in 1:26, and eliminated Lesnar from the Royal Rumble, Goldberg appeared to have The Beast Incarnates number. However, it was a different number this time around, as Lesnar delivered 10 German suplexes to the champion.
Despite landing four spears  one through the barricade  and a Jackhammer, Lesnar would not give in, and it took an F5 from Lesnar to clinch his first victory over Goldberg and win the title in the process.
Randy Orton became a 13-time world champion as he defeated his former mentor, Bray Wyatt, in a creepy and disturbing affair that saw the ring canvas transform into a picture of maggots, worms and coachroaches on three different occasions.
Orton would overcome the distraction though, and landed an RKO out of nowhere to pick up the victory and win the WWE Championship once again.
Bayley was able to retain her Raw Womens Championship despite the odds being stacked against her. The Fatal Four-Way saw Bayley, Charlotte and Sasha Banks team up to successfully take down the wrecking ball that is Nia Jax, but once she was out of the equation, the trio went to battle.
Charlotte eliminated Banks when he head cannoned off an exposed turnbuckle, but not even Charlotte has an answer for Bayley when she landed the Macho Man Elbow off the top rope.
Naomi enjoyed a homecoming to remember as she returned to win the Smackdown Womens Championship, just one month after having to relinquish the title due to injury. She beat off competition from Becky Lynch, Carmella, Mickie James, Natalya and defending champion Alexa Bliss, who conceded the title by tapping out to Naomis submission lock.
The opening bout of the night proved to be one filled with highlight moments, as AJ Styles went about teaching Smackdown Commissioner Shane McMahon the respect he said he lacked. Styles had to deal with being on the end of a Coast to Coast that saw a trash can kicked into his face, before dodging both a flying elbow and a shooting star press by McMahon to win the match with a Phenomenal Forearm.
The broken friendship between Kevin Owens and Chris Jericho saw the United States Championship change hands as the former WWE Heavyweight champion got the better of Y2J. Owens attempted to beat Jericho at his own game, locking his opponent in the Walls of Jericho, but when Jericho escaped and did the same, Owens found himself in trouble.
A Pop-Up Powerbomb was not enough to see off Jericho, and when Owens went for a second, Jericho countered with a Codebreaker that looked to clinch him victory. Owens, however, placed a solitary finger on the ropes, and when he caught Jericho outside the ring, Owens powerbombed Jericho onto the ring canvas back-first before rolling him in to the ring and picking up the three-count.
John Cena and Nikki Bella got the better of The Miz and Maryse in a couple vs couple match, but it will be the moments afterwards that will be remembered most at WrestleMania 33. Cena did the unthinkable as he got down on one knee and proposed to Nikki, who immediately said yes, and the two went happy into the night.
On the WrestleMania kick-off show, Dean Ambrose defeated Baron Corbin to retain the Intercontinental Title, while Neville pinned Austin Aries to retain the Cruiserweight Championship. However, it was Mojo Rawleys victory, with the help of the New England Patriots star Rob Gronkowski, to win the Andre The Giant Battle Royal, that really caught the attention.
