New insurance regulations pose challenges to companies
Matthew Maguire, Partner Two of NMG Consulting said that recent changes in the Sri Lankan regulatory landscape have resulted in companies having to think more strategically about their underlying business, and the consequences from a risk based perspective.
Speaking at the NMG Consulting networking reception for its clients at the Colombo Swimming Club to celebrate its 25th anniversary, he said that this has led to a step change in the ways companies approach their business.
Maguire said that while the motor business continues to dominate the industry, the results for the industry will depend upon the experience of this class. With the ongoing regulatory changes following the Full Implementation of RBC, companies are more closely scrutinising their return on capital and how they want to participate in the industry. This is already apparent following the M&A activity seen over the last two years.
To address the increasing challenges and requirements in the market NMG has strengthened its team in Colombo covering account management and technical services, including Big Data analytics.
NMG also partners with technology vendors to provide their clients in Sri Lanka.NMG Consulting is part of the NMG Group, a privately held company, focused exclusively on non-banking financial services and wealth management.

NMG Consulting has been providing advisory services to the Sri Lankan market almost since its inception.
However, over the last 10 years the scope of services has expanded and NMG is now the largest supplier of general insurance actuarial advisory services in the market. The team currently calculates the value of reserves required for 12 of the 15 general insurers in the country as well as providing strategic advisory services to banks and conglomerates.
Partner, Roshan Perera in his welcome address said We focus on three industries: investments, insurance and reinsurance, with our business spanning across three core practices  strategy, management, and actuarial.

Some GMOA office-bearers trying to topple Govt
Some office-bearers of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) have no discipline and their only wish is to topple the government,Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the Nursing Diploma Certificate Awarding Ceremony for the 2012 at Temple Trees.
One thousand two hundred and twenty nurses obtained their diploma certificates at the ceremony. Minister Senaratne said that trade unions affiliated to the Health Ministry like to stage strikes.
They hold the strikes and say that the strikes are successful, Minister Senaratne said.
They are putting the lives of the people at stake by doing so. They should resort to strike action only if discussions were not successful.But, these trade unions start with trade union action. Some office bearers of the GMOA do not like to hold discussions, Minister Senaratne said.
He also said that strikes should not be the only means for trade unions. He added that although the government attempts to solve the issues in a diplomaric manner, certain trade unions act to the contrary. No matter the issues created, this government cannot be toppled, Minister Senaratne said.
The government should take stern action against the GMOA. I am always of that view. They have received free education to become doctors,but, the actions of some doctors cannot be acceptable,the Minister said.
The Minister said that when the Ministry said that disciplinary action would be taken against the medical staff, the trade unions threaten to resort to strike action.
In the past, the strikes was staged to protect the free health service,but,currently strikes are held with other intentions, Minister Senaratne said.
During a discussion with the GMOA, the Health Services Director General had told them that he was working in accordance with the government regulations.
The Minister said that the GMOA in response to Health Services Director General had said that they would see to it when they toppled the government after three years.
We have to change the mentality of some of the GMOA office-bearers, Minister Senaratne said.
The Good Governance Government is not ready to be toppled. The government is committed to serving the people. Therefore, nobody can topple this government,the Minister added.

Babar, Hasan lead Pakistan to 74-run win
PROVIDENCE, Guyana: Babar Azam stroked yet another hundred against the West Indies and Hasan Ali claimed five wickets as Pakistan won the second one-day international by 74 runs at the National Stadium in Guyana on Sunday.
Put in by West Indies captain Jason Holder, Pakistan totalled 282 for five and then dismissed the hosts for 208 off 44.5 overs despite a battling knock from Holder, who was last out to Ali for a top score of 68.
Reinstated in his favourite number three spot in the batting order, Azam held a faltering innings together and then accelerated towards an unbeaten 125, his fifth century in ODIs and fourth in five innings against the Caribbean side.
His classy knock occupied 132 deliveries and was embellished with three sixes and seven fours.
I just wanted to bat through to the end of the innings and I was able to achieve that to help us put up a good total, he said.
It doesnt matter where I bat, I just want to make a contribution for the team. Azam received critical support from Imad Wasim, the all-rounder finishing unbeaten on 43 in an unbroken sixth-wicket stand of 99 which released the shackles of previously disciplined West Indian bowling on a pitch lacking the pace and bounce from the first match -- which the home team won by four wickets -- two days earlier.
On a good batting pitch the home side also lost their discipline in the reply, crashing to 75 for six with a series of poor shots while the Pakistan bowlers showed much greater intent than in the first game.
Our batting at the top again let us down because I felt, on this pitch, we definitely had a chance to get to 283, Holder noted at the end of the match.
Maybe it would have been different with some more runs at the top but now we have to focus on winning on Tuesday (in the third and final match).
Holder was given support by Ashley Nurse, who belted a one-day best 44 in dominating a 58-run seventh-wicket stand with his captain. AFP

Beef Ban, Beer, and Bullying..!
As beef and beer get scarce in India, bullying seems to be replacing the culinary delights of eating and drinking. We were worried when cow slaughter was banned, remarked a villager, Added to that, courts decided to make beer scarce, so the only pastime left was bullying!
And what a wonderful recreation it is! agreed a city resident, If Id known it was such fun, Id have given up beer and beef a long time ago!
They both watched as their leader, a local ruffian swaggered over, Today is Sunday! he said.
So no bullying today they both asked looking mournful, We dont want any holidays from bullying, thats the only way, I can handle the craving in my belly and the cries of my liver!
I never said its a holiday! smiled their local leader, Today we scare church goers in their churches!
Hurray! cried the two and gathering a gang rushed into a local church, tore their religious books and looked the priest in the face, You are converting our people! they both shouted.
These are our regular worshippers! said the worried priest, We are not doing any conversion!
With a war cry, they turned over the pews, pinned the people against the wall, tore the clothes off the women, smashed a few sacred items and then ran out triumphant.
That was good fun! shouted the villager.
I didnt even feel the need for a sip of beer!
Or me, beef! said the villager, Hey look, why is that boy standing alone They both looked at a young lad talking on his phone, standing in the shade while he spoke.
When a boy stands alone, he is an eve teaser! shouted the resident.
Eve teasers are a menace to society, thats what the chief minister said!
The boy speaking on the phone suddenly found himself thrown to the ground. He screamed, and his mother who he was speaking to on the other end, shouted his name, but her words went unheard as his phone fell on the ground and was trampled on roughly by the two. Never tease our women! they cried as they beat him up and left him a crumpled mess.
It was evening when the two sauntered back together, We are helping improve our country, after the beef and beer ban! they said to one another.
Thats true! said the city resident. I feel pure and holy today!
Join me for dinner! winked his friend the villager. I might be able to serve you something you may relish! My wife has been able to lay hands on some smuggled beef!
Excellent! shouted the city man, And Ive got some home crafted beer with me! Lets celebrate this ban together!
And the virtuous two walked piously towards their celebration dinner..!

Belt and Road Initiative injects new vitality into traditional friendship
Over the past 60 years, the Sri Lanka-China relations have withstood the test of international changes and maintained the healthy and stable development.
In the past years, the two countries have taken the opportunities generated from the China-proposed Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, known as the Belt and Road Initiative, to continuously expand the breadth and depth of cooperation in various fields between the two countries, with mutually beneficial cooperation yielding fruits and the future development of bilateral ties showing broad prospects, thus injecting new vitality into their strategic cooperative partnership.
In 2009, Sri Lanka, with the strong assistance from the international community, ended a 30-year-long civil war. In the post-war reconstruction, the Chinese government and the Chinese people have continued to lend a helping hand to provide a large number of concessional low interest rate loans and investments for Sri Lanka.
A series of mega infrastructure projects have also been launched, constructed and put into operation, greatly contributing to the socio-economic development of Sri Lanka and improving the livelihood of its people.The mega infrastructure projects, including the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant, which is Sri Lankas first coal-fired power plant, the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), the expressway linking the capital of Colombo to the Bandaranaike International Airport and the upgrading of the Hambantota harbour, have all played an irreplaceable role in Sri Lankas economic recovery and development.
They have also laid a solid foundation for speeding up the industrialization process of the country.The completion of the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway has immensely benefitted the country as well as tourists arriving in the island country.
The expressway allows travellers and tourists to connect the Bandaranaike International Airport with Colombo in about 45 minutes from the initial two hours during peak traffic hours.
The Southern Expressway linking Colombo to Galle in the south has cut the travel time to one hour and 50 minutes from the initial four hours.
In 2014, the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) run by the China Merchants Group started operation ahead of schedule which has produced tangible results for the countrys economy.
In 2016, the CICT container volumes grew to 2 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units) and the Colombo Port was soon named the best terminal in South Asia.
In 2016, the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant provided more than 50 percent of the total electricity to the entire country.
The price of electricity in Sri Lanka was cut down by 25 percent after the construction of the power plant.
According to the Ceylon Electricity Board, the power plant generates an estimated 1.5-million-U.S. dollar profit for the Sri Lankan government per day.
As Chinas Belt and Road Initiative highly dovetails with the strategic development of Sri Lanka, the island country has expressed its willingness on many occasions to actively participate in the construction of the initiative in a bid to attract more Chinese investment and inject new impetus into its economic development.
The two countries are now working together to pragmatically and steadily press ahead with construction of a $1.4 billion Colombo port city, extension of the southern expressway, second phase of the Hambantota harbor, Colombo outer circular expressway, Moragahakanda dam, and Yan Oya irrigation project, among others.
Construction of the extension of the southern expressway will significantly improve the interconnection between the western and southern parts of Sri Lanka and speed up the economic development in the regions.
The Attanagalla Water Plant in the north of Colombo is a priority development project of the Government and the largest China-Sri Lanka cooperation project launched this year concerning the livelihood of Sri Lankans.
The plant will provide drinking water for about 600,000 local residents in a radius of 400 square km.
Once those projects concerning production and peoples livelihood are completed, Sri Lankas infrastructure will get a leapfrog lifting, thus laying solid foundation for the take-off of the countrys economy.
Sri lanka and China are now coordinating on pushing forward the construction and operation of the second phase of the Hambantota harbour, among others.
It is hopeful that the region of Hambantota will be forged as an industrial zone in Sri Lanka, becoming an engine to drive economic development of the island country.

Boost for water sports in NWP
The coastal belt from Wennappuwa to Chilaw of the North Western Province is an ideal location for ocean based water sports such as scuba diving, windsurfing, sailing, yachting and surfing.
The Asian German Sports Exchange Programme has decided to set up a Marina in the deep sea off Marawila which would help to anchor sailing boats, yachts and motor boats which would immensely benefit competitors in the ocean based sports.
Local and foreign competitors from Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea are likely to take part in these events which would help to promote the region as a tourist destination as they will be visiting the country along with their family members.

Born to be hurt
Despite its toughened shell, turtles have earned much repute as a juicy delicacy in Sri Lanka. Mother turtles are shy by nature, hence fear the worst. They are nevertheless left without any option other than coming ashore to lay their eggs and let nature take its course.
If you have ever wondered about the destiny of these minuscule creatures born in the soft sand, it mostly ends up as a sad tale. But now things are taking a different tide thanks to a number of good-hearted hatcheries set up down south. They hatch plans to rescue the creatures from being subject to poaching.
On your drive along the Galle-Colombo main road, you will not miss this locale with a large plate that reads Mahamodara Turtle Hatchery in not so sophisticated script. The arrow sign below the script leads you inside along a grassy patch of land. Walking a few metres, you will finally reach a backyard which hardly looks a hatchery at all  but not when you step in across the wooden plank after paying the entrance fee.
Next, it is your turn to get surprised when you hear of its owner: Nilanga, a tuk-tuk owner with a paltry income, yet affluent kindness for turtles, to run this business.
The turtle season is usually between May and December. During this time, a large number of turtles come ashore to lay eggs between 9 pm and 5 am. We have to stay sleepless and watch out for them. Otherwise, people will come and grab their eggs for meat, Nilanga explains his mission against poaching, a persistent problem in the very much touristy area down south.
Located in the backyard of their home, this small turtle hatchery narrates a passionate tale about Nilangas familys devotion to rescuing the helpless sea creatures.
Nilanga allocates a lions share of his tuk-tuk income to the mission. They manage to secure occasional funds from benefactors. They have been channelled to build the tanks and roofs to shelter the turtles. The amount you pay as entrance fee will also be drawn to run the hatchery.
Inside the hatchery, you will be greeted by turtles of diverse age groups - one-day old ones included. The large turtles are kept from being released to sea, because of various health concerns. Most turtles get hit by fishing boats and injure their necks. Nilanga lifts a large turtle that had eaten a plastic bag mistaking it for a jellyfish. A separate tank is home to such turtles that will be released to sea following a complete recovery.
In the corner of the hatchery is a nesting area where the eggs are laid for babies to hatch on time. Despite its moderate roof cover, Nilanga and his family are still bothered by the threat of invading reptiles.
That is a serious problem, though we keep on attending to it with various solutions. They are tough to keep away from. They easily smell the eggs and try to approach the area, Nilanga noted.
When the baby turtles come of age, they can be released to the sea. The participants get an opportunity to release them too.
A TripAdvisor reviewer, however, cautions against hiring tuk-tuks to reach the place.
The tuk-tuk drivers will demand commission from the owners, who are challenged financially in the first place. So please, if you need transport, call the number above [0755402553] and the owner will come get you in his own tuk-tuk, notes Sarah J on TripAdvisor.
By the look of it, you will probably hasten to detect this as just another activity of exploitation to lure  or chisel, perhaps - tourists. You should be in the right, reasonably. However, their passionate project, despite restricted funds, has saved thousands of turtles from being victims of poaching and other injuries caused by the fishery industry.
Suffice to say, the hatchery is a much safer place for the turtles to settle down than sea, their original home. That, of course, is merely an idealistic notion given the fact that the place is not quite spacious to accommodate such an infinite amount of turtles. But the injured turtles have to stay here until they recover. The baby turtles have to stay here until they grow mature enough for sea. Your generous contribution, apart from the entrance fee, will be a crucial factor in keeping them within the comfortable confines.
The turtles here are not just items of exhibition. You can caress them, feel them and even feed them, as long as making sure that you do not hurt them. The notice boards in the surrounding will give you a precise idea about the turtle species in Sri Lanka as well as the world over. Nilanga and his wife, Nisha, will enlighten you whenever you need to know something.
If you reach there at the right time, you will even be able to release the teenage turtles to the sea.
If not for passion, Nilanga would have given in altogether. Apart from a few benefactors, he hardly gets any support. Even the mainstream hatcheries located in Galle turn a blind eye to his concerns. That could be because they need a share of the credit too, Nilanga reasons. But he is not the one to give up that simply. Nor is his wife! They both take turns to turtle-sit with a heart coupled with passion as well as kindness. That is exactly why this couple deserves your visit and a small stipend of generous kindness.

Breathing life to foreign reserves
A South Korean ship unloads its cargo of cars at a terminal in Hambantota port, providing the only sign of life at Sri Lankas newest harbour, sited on its southern coast. The rest of this $1.4 billion port, built with a loan from Chinas Export-Import Bank, sits idle. In some areas, weeds are spreading. Visitors to the ports administrative offices must tiptoe around feral dogs stretched out in front of an empty entrance hall.
Emptiness has dogged the port since it opened in 2012. Five years later, only a handful of car carriers drop anchor each week. The ruling coalition government, led by President Maithirpala Sirisena, says the port is a white elephant left by the previous regime, led by the autocratic former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Mounting operating losses, estimated at $235 million, deepen the impression that the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port, as the facility is officially known, was a Rajapaksa vanity project.

The ruling coalition wants to end this drain on the countrys economy. The cabinet has just endorsed a public-private partnership agreement with China Merchants Port Holdings, a state-run Chinese company, which will take an 80 percent debt-for-equity stake in a joint venture that will run the 1,500-hectare port. The government is hoping to recover $1.12 billion over the 99-year lease, and will look for more Chinese cash if plans are approved for a 6,000-hectare special industrial zone on an adjacent site.
The Chinese government is strongly supportive of the port, which Beijing sees as part of its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative for a network of land and maritime trade routes around Asia. We want to help Sri Lanka build a transport hub and a logistics center, Qiu Xinli, Chief of the Political Section at the Chinese embassy in Colombo, told the Nikkei Asian Review. It is a good project, no matter which government is in power in Sri Lanka.
For Sri Lanka, giving a new lease of life to Hambantota port is a big step toward building a maritime economy, the ruling coalitions vision for the South Asian island. But it is also a crucial element in the governments attempts to build up its depleted foreign reserves in the face of a looming debt repayment crisis.
By 2019, the country needs to repay $3.99 billion to foreign debtors, compared with payments of $1.82 billion in 2016. Foreign reserves fell to $4.23 billion in November 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund, which warned after a visit to Sri Lanka in March of impending repayment problems. Net international reserves fell short of the target, and progress on implementing structural benchmarks was somewhat uneven, the fund said.
Major plus
Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank regards the Hambantota deal as a major plus for the reserves. This year, at least, we could get $400 million if the deal goes through, he said at a press conference after the cabinet announcement. A member of the banks monetary board echoed a similar sentiment at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the countrys oldest business organization, saying, The government wants to look at this transaction to address some of the broader macroeconomic issues, so the deal is not just about the port.
Coomaraswamy has set his sights on increasing Sri Lankas foreign exchange reserves to $7.5 billion by the end of this year, part of which will be achieved through a planned $1.5 billion sovereign bond issue and a $700 million syndicated loan. We are operating on a thin margin, and if there is some shock or volatility, then there can be a crisis, the governor told the media.
The reserves recovered to $5.6 billion in February 2017, according to the central bank, but Sri Lanka will require $7 billion by 2019 to cover loans and bridge its rising deficit on the capital account of the balance of payments. According to the IMF, total external and domestic public debt amounted to 76 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2015, the latest figures available, compared with 70.7 percent in 2014. About $8 billion is owed to China for loans secured by the Rajapaksa regime between 2005 and 2015. The loans, written at commercial interest rates, funded a raft of infrastructure projects, including Hambantota port.
The depth of Sri Lankas looming economic crisis is illustrated by the deteriorating trade deficit, which grew from $8.4 billion in calendar 2015 to nearly $9.1 billion in 2016, according to the central bank. The deficit has been rising annually since 2013, when it stood at $7.5 billion. Earnings from Sri Lankas narrow export base, largely restricted to garments and tea, fell by 2.2 percent in 2016, compared with the previous year, while imports rose by 2.5 percent.
The current account of the balance of payments is likely to be in surplus for the year, thanks to tourism earnings, which rose by 18 percent to $3.5 billion and remittances from Sri Lankan workers in the Middle East and other parts of Asia, who sent home $7.2 billion, a 3.7 percent increase from the previous year. But the coalition government has had to stomach bad news about foreign direct investmentdespite boasts after a shock election victory two years ago that it would attract more international investors.
FDI inflows plunged by 34 percent to $444.5 in 2016, compared with $677.6 million in 2015. The central bank estimated in a report on March 27 that the overall balance of payments will record a deficit of $499.7 million for 2016, after taking account of loans and portfolio investment flows, following a deficit of $1.49 billion in 2015.
Policy uncertainty
Sri Lankas FDI record compares poorly with developing countries such as Vietnam, which attracted $11 billion in 2015, and Myanmar, which received $4 billion that year. In 2016, the investment climate [in Sri Lanka] was significantly affected by political uncertainty, policy uncertainty and tax uncertainties, because the coalition government was giving mixed messages, said Shiran Fernando, lead economist at Frontier Research, a Colombo-based think tank. This negatively affected potential investments, since there were new players and new countries that showed an interest in Sri Lanka, but little of that materialized.
Most foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka flows into the thriving property sector, shaping Colombos shifting skyline.
Nature has not spared the island, either. The worst drought in decades during the main rice cultivation season, which begins in the second half of the year, cut the 2017 harvest by 53 percent to 1.82 million tonsa severe blow given that agriculture contributes 9 percent of GDP and employs 28 percent of the labor force. The department of census and statistics said in March that the droughtand severe floods that preceded itwould cut GDP growth to 4.4 percent for 2016, compared with 4.8 percent the previous year. The government had to dip into its depleted foreign reserves to import rice from Asian neighbors.
The fragility of the economy has been highlighted by the IMF, which approved a $1.5 billion loan to Sri Lanka last year to stave off a balance of payments crisis. A more prolonged drought could raise food and oil imports with adverse impact on growth, inflation and the balance of payments, said Jaewoo Lee, head of the IMF mission to Colombo in March. But Lee kept the Sri Lanka government guessing over the release of the $119.9 million third tranche of the loan, which is due to be transferred in April.
The IMF bailoutthe only one currently being delivered to an Asian country, other than war-torn Afghanistanconfirmed the countrys economic malaise. Having an IMF program is the equivalent of being in hospital, Coomaraswamy remarked during a January presentation of the central banks overview entitled: Road map for 2017 and beyond. He added: We are not in the ICU [intensive care unit] but clearly in the hospital.
The governments efforts to balance the books have been praised by Fitch, the global credit ratings agency, which in February revised Sri Lankas credit outlook from negative to stable, and confirmed the countrys B+ sovereign credit rating. The agency praised the government for pushing ahead with IMF prescriptions, including raising value added taxes and reducing public spending to cut the budget deficit, which dropped from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.6 percent in 2016. There is new pressure however to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.5 percent by 2020.
The government is also pushing ahead with restructuring state-owned enterprisesalso suggested by the IMFdespite the risk of a political backlash. It announced in late March the first steps toward the privatization of strategic assets such as the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, the Ceylon Electricity Board, the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Sri Lankan Airlines, the national carrier. The IMF estimates the debts of these four state companies at $7.93 billion.
Finance Ministry officials have also discussed the sale of nonstrategic assets ranging from a five-star hotel to a hospital. But will the government stay the course It may have little choice, given the depleted foreign reserves and ticking debt clock. The Hambantota port deal has surfaced as a gauge of whether it will be possible to unload more debt-ridden state assets for dollars. No wonder, at some seminars in Colombo, speakers give the impression that the country faces an SOS moment.

BSB join in romantic serenade for fans proposal
The Backstreet Boys (BSB) helped a fan propose to his girlfriend by joining him in a serenade of their song Drowning.
Kitty Tung has been a massive fan of the boy band for years, with boyfriend James Guan also enjoying the groups musical talents. So when it came to popping the question to Kitty, James knew he wanted to involve the boys in some way.
After buying tickets to go and see them perform in Las Vegas, James got in touch with their management team to pitch his proposal idea, before being told that the groups unpredictable schedule would make his idea hard to pull off.
Undeterred, James bought tickets to a VIP event, and told Kitty he had won passes to meet-and-greet the five-piece. Once at the event, James told Kitty he was going to thank one of the bands security guards for the tickets he had won, before actually telling the guard his plans to pop the question. The helpful guard then pulled singer Brian Littrell to one side, with Brian then passing on the message to his bandmates and the groups photographer. Josh then told Kitty to come to the front of the line, again fobbing her off by telling her it was part of his prize package, before getting down on one knee.
He had planned to sing Drownings emotional line I cant imagine a life without your love and even forever dont seem like long enough as he proposed, but was left stunned when the boys joined in his serenade as well.
I started telling Kitty that she meant the world to me and that she was the best thing that has ever happened to me, then I started singing the lyrics from Drowning and was planning to ask Will you marry me But BSB then started singing and I was totally shocked! James smiled to Entertainment Tonight.
It was the most amazing moment ever... although my singing was off-key. I couldnt believe I was singing together with the Backstreet Boys and serenading Kitty!
James new bride-to-be Kitty was also taken aback by the incredible moment, telling the outlet: I was in total disbelief when he got down on one knee. And when the Backstreet Boys started singing, I was trying to remain calm, but my heart was beating so fast. It was so surreal and I couldnt believe that the Backstreet Boys helped him pull this off!

## Title: BUILDING BLOCKS FOR HIGH-PERFORMING JUDICIARY

BUILDING BLOCKS FOR HIGH-PERFORMING JUDICIARY
The late V R Krishna Iyer, one of the most eminent jurists to sit on the Supreme Court of India, pithily and wittingly said once that the replacement of the patronage of the political boss with patronage of the judicial boss has not improved the quality of judiciary. It was a critique of the Collegium selecting Supreme Court Judges in India. He went onto say. the Collegium is a judicial creation and the syndrome of the personality cult being beyond accountability. It is bizarre in its performance - its selection process is secret and suspect and is subject to no scrutiny. It excludes the executive and is in that respect unique in the world. Why India should retain such a bedlam process, akin to a pre feudal power cult, is unclear. Parliament must make a law regarding selection of judges, a code of conduct for judges and a Performance Commission as has been done by many States in the U.S..
Principles of judicial performance evaluation
Judicial performance evaluation programme requires high quality materials. These principles are: Transparency  The system should be designed so that all involved  the judges, the evaluation commission, survey respondents, and the public  fully understand and trust the evaluation process.
Fairness  Evaluations should be fair in design and result.
Supreme Court complex
Thoroughness  Evaluations should take into account all relevant information, and be done frequently enough so that the data is meaningful. The data upon which evaluations rely must be as comprehensive as possible.
Shared expectations  Evaluations should teach judges about their strengths and weaknesses on the bench, and promote improved performance. At the same time, evaluations should teach the public about the proper way to evaluate a judge, based on process-oriented measures, not individual case outcomes.
There are fifteen building blocks for a judicial performance evaluation programme:
1. Authorization: How should a judicial performance evaluation programme be legally authorized
2. Implementation: What will the rules governing the programme say
3. Placement: What branch of government, if any, should oversee the programme
4. Reach: Should there be local performance commissions for local judges
5. Composition: What should the make-up of the performance commission be, and how should its members be chosen
6. Timing: How frequently should evaluations be conducted
7. Confidentiality: When, if at all, should evaluations be kept confidential
8. Deliberation: Should the commissions meetings be open to the public
9. Criteria: What are the appropriate bases for evaluating judges
10. Data Collection: What information do we want on the judges
11. Benchmarks: What threshold standards should be expected of every judge
12. Recommendation: Should the commission issue a formal recommendation on retention, if applicable
13. Appeal: What process should a judge have to appeal the evaluation results
14. Publication: What information should the commission make available to the public
15. Dissemination: How should the commissions work be made available to the public
The OConnor Judicial Selection Plan- Judicial Nominating Commissions
The judicial nominating commission is the key to merit selection, of state court judges in the US. Nominating commissions are currently used in 30 states and the District of Columbia to choose judges.
How it works
Whenever a vacancy occurs on the bench, judicial nominating commissions should be the screening entity that accepts applications from potential judicial candidates and identifies a list of finalists for the Governor. Structure and composition of the commissions must provide a climate that fosters public confidence in the process while encouraging highly qualified candidates to apply. They must not be a political or partisan entity and should be representative of the community to be served by the judge.
Elements that comprise an effective nominating commission taken from existing nominating commission processes include: nominating commissions should be constitutionally based, there should be an appellate nominating commission and one or more trial court nominating commissions, in order to assure that the public viewpoint is well represented, a nominating commission should include a majority of non-attorney members who have a range of professional backgrounds and personal experience. Nominating commissions must not be viewed as captive to attorney groups. Nominating commission proceedings should reflect openness and transparency, carefully balancing the applicants need for confidentiality with the publics right to know. The respective terms of commission members should be staggered so that no one leadership group has a predominant voice. Staggered terms also prevent complete turnover in the commissions membership, which provides new members with the benefit of existing members experience and ensures rotation among appointing authorities. There should be a default provision in place should the nominating commission fail to act.
Evaluating Appellate Judges
Perhaps the most significant difference between appellate and trial judges is in their work; while trial judges make rulings throughout the course of a trial, an appellate judges primary output is the written opinion. Second, in todays political climate, appellate judges are increasingly coming under fire for unpopular rulings in a single case or on a specific hot-button issue.
Evaluating appellate judges that includes the following:
* Guidelines and templates for reviewing a judges written opinions for legal analysis and reasoning, clarity, and fairness.
* Surveys about appellate judges for attorneys who appear before them and use their opinions, trial judges who apply their rulings, and court staff who work closely with them.
* A self-evaluation tool that allows judges to assess their own strengths, weaknesses, and overall performance
Judicial Service Commission as aPerformance Commission
The Judicial Performance Commission could serve a valuable function. Litigants should have the power to refer to the Commission a complaint about the conduct of a judge. More recently Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC called for the Judicial Services Commission to have broader input from the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, the President of the Bar Association and relevant civil society representatives to ensure a better informed approach in the matter of appointment and tenure of members of the minor judiciary.

One of the largest local cosmetic manufactures, Chandanaleepa will be plans to obtain two international patents for two new products by the end of the year.
Philip Nehri Mullegama, CEO of the company, told Daily News Business that research in this regard which has been done jointly by the Chandanalepa R&D team and two companies in the USA and France have now been completed and were on final test runs.
Some traditional ayurvedha recipes used by the chairmans (Ranjith Prematillike) father, Dr. D. P. P. Jayaratne too would be used for this innovation. He said that two products would be made using 100% local ayurvedha material and would be marketed both locally and internationally. He said that the factory based in Veyangoda has invested around Rs. 450 million last year for R&D and also for machinery to increase production.
We are currently exporting to 10 countries including Japan, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Malaysia, Singapore and Dubai. We hope to increase our overseas market to 40 countries by 2020.
He also said that they will also introduce a child care range and soap by the end of the year. Commenting on the industry he said that there are many cosmetic products that are dumped from China and due to this the gray market is huge.

China, Sri Lanka vow to deepen cooperation
China and Sri Lanka have pledged to deepen pragmatic cooperation in all fields to further develop the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries.
The pledge was made when visiting Chinese top political advisor Yu Zhengsheng held talks with Sri Lankan leaders.
Yu, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), visited the island country from Thursday to Saturday at the invitation of Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
While meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday, Yu said China and Sri Lanka are traditional good neighbors and their peoples have enjoyed long history of exchanges.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 60 years ago, China and Sri Lanka have supported each other on the issues concerning their core and significant interests, with mutual beneficial cooperation bringing substantial benefits to the peoples of the two sides, the Chinese top political advisor said.
The leaders of the two countries have jointly mapped out the strategic plans for developing the China-Sri Lanka ties, and the two countries should take the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two sides as an opportunity to further implement the consensus reached by the leaders, maintain high-level exchanges, deepen political trust, connect development strategies of the two countries, jointly construct the Belt and Road, boost people to people exchanges, consolidate the friendly public opinions in the two countries so as to further push forward the strategic cooperative partnership between the two sides, Yu said.
For his part, Sirisena said Sri Lanka and China have enjoyed long history of friendship and friendly people to people exchanges.
China has given strong support to Sri Lanka in peace realization and economic recovery, and Sri Lankan people love and respect China, the president said.
As the development of bilateral ties has entered a new stage, Sri Lanka will continue to uphold the one China policy and is looking forward to maintaining frequent high-level exchanges, deepen and broaden economic and trade cooperation and strengthen coordination and cooperation with China in international affairs, he added.
During his meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday, Yu said the China-Sri Lanka relations have witnessed comprehensive development in recent years with deepening pragmatic cooperation, and positive achievements have been scored in major cooperation projects.
Both sides should give play to their own advantages, exploit cooperation potential and jointly build the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, Yu said, adding that they should also push for the steady development of key cooperation projects including the Colombo Port City and the Hambantota harbur.
Meanwhile, China and Sri Lanka should speed up negotiations on the bilateral free trade agreement (FTA), and expand their cooperation to new areas such as ocean, tourism and industry capacity so as to achieve mutual benefits and common development, he said.
For his part, Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka is in the process of industrialisation, modernisation, and urbanisation, and that his country looks forward to boosting cooperation with China in the fields of trade, finance, ports, and transportation infrastructure. Sri Lanka is willing to join hands with China to build the Belt and Road so as to speed up the island countrys economic development and boost regional economic integration, the prime minister said.
Also, on Friday, the Chinese top political advisor met with Sri Lankan Parliament Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, saying that China is very happy to see social stability, economic development, and continuous improvement of the peoples living standard in Sri Lanka.

Chinese trade likely to rebound in March
Chinese trade likely rebounded in March. Exports are benefiting from stronger global demand, especially in the U.S. Imports are picking up on the back of steady domestic demand and increased manufacturing. Chinas booming housing market continues to boost money supply.
House price growth in Tier 1 cities is slowing as government measures to rein in credit growth start to take hold. But outside this, the housing market remains strong and continued to drive credit growth in March. The housing market is also supporting consumer price gains, which likely strengthened in March. Producer prices are also expected to accelerate as rising global commodity prices push up raw material costs.
Indian inflation is edging higher, with March headline CPI expected to strengthen. Higher global commodity prices are pushing up the cost of energy, while lower food prices provide some offset. Wholesale prices are also expected to accelerate, driven mostly by higher fuel prices due to a low base. Indian manufacturers likely slowed in February because of a slowdown in investment. Adding a further dampener to production is the disruption from the governments demonetisation policy.
Elsewhere, industrial production continues to expand steadily in the Philippines as domestic demand and improved global conditions support manufacturing. Malaysian production is also expected to have rebounded in February after the Lunar New Year disruptions.In Japan, machinery orders are expected to have rebounded in February after the Lunar New Year dragged on growth in January. Export-facing firms are benefiting from a weaker yen, but the recent appreciation poses a downside risk to the outlook. Singapores economy likely started 2017 on steady footing. Upbeat manufacturing and services were likely offset by weakness in construction due to the fall in residential property prices.
Australias housing market is growing strongly, and this will support mortgage growth. The regulatory body is working with major lenders to tighten lending standards, and this will likely dampen mortgage growth in the coming months. Australias unemployment rate likely held steady in March because of subdued employment growth. This suggests wages will remain weak through the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, Koreas unemployment rate likely dipped in March as job growth picked up on the back of stronger export conditions. However, restructuring by indebted businesses, especially in the shipping industry, will limit the gains.
The Bank of Korea will likely maintain its current monetary policy stance. The economy is on the mend, but domestic conditions remain difficult and high private debt will keep the bank from easing further.

Re-introduce the lucky draws for banks
Until about four years ago most banks and other registered financial institutions conducted monthly, half yearly and yearly lucky draws for their customers based on the balance available. The winners got prizes ranging from domestic electric appliances such as refrigerators, TVs, cars and houses as prizes.
However one of the governors of the Central Bank during the MR regime issued instructions to the bank to stop these draws and instead have a scheme whereby one gets a gift when reaching a certain age, at marriage, graduation, on reaching 60 years etc.
This has resulted in the Senior Citizens being completely ignored as they are not eligible to get any gift going by the categories mentioned.
I suggest that the incumbent governor of the Central Bank re introduces the former scheme that the banks had so that the customers will stand a chance to win prizes irrespective of their age and social standing.

Collaborating for Good Karma
Time and again leading Sri Lankan film personalities like Gamini Fonseka, Chandran Rutnam, V Vamadevan, Ravindra Randeniya and Jayantha Jayatilleke have stressed the need for collaborations to add value to local cinema.
Collaborations have facilitated the fraternity to absorb expertise and global trends in filmmaking from the international sphere. A Sri Lankan cinema personality like Errol Kelly made his name known internationally, due to his involvement in collaborative ventures.
Regional collaborations paved way for Sabeetha Perera to become the best actress in Pakistan. Hollywood movies like Bridge on the River Kwai, Indiana Jones and The Temple of Doom, Mountain in the Jungle, Rampage and Machan were shot in Sri Lanka on location as collaborations. Bridge on the River Kwai won a many Academy Awards exposing the scenic beauty of our country to the whole world.
At this juncture more facilities and concessions should be offered to collaborative ventures to rejuvenate local cinema and develop its market. In the process the brand Sri Lanka too will consolidate its positioning in the world map.
The Film Team and Good Karma Hospital
The Film Team (TFT) conducted a special event at JAIC Hilton with the participation of Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake, film stars Sriyani Amarasena, Lucky Dias, Sabitha Perera, Sangeetha Weeraratne, and Yashodha Wimaladharma and journalists to announce completion of its collaborative TV production, The Good Karma Hospital.
TFT is an entity formed a decade back as a Locations Service provider for production of International motion pictures in Sri Lanka.
It has convinced Tiger Aspect Productions (UK) to produce their TV series The Good Karma Hospital in Sri Lanka, which was originally scheduled to be shot in India.
Tiger Aspects decision to work with TFT was based on the latters professional and successful handling of many international film productions over the last 10 years, to name a few, Emden Men (Germany), Midnights Children (Canada), Bombay Velvet (India), Jekyll & Hyde (ITV-UK), Dream Hotel (Austria). TFT is poised to make Sri Lanka the ideal filming destination on forecasting the numerous and multifaceted benefits in store.
The story of TheGood Karma Hospital revolves around a junior doctor, Ruby Walker, who arrives in India looking for a job and a distraction from her heartbreak. She anticipates the sunshine and picture-perfect beaches. What she doesnt expect are the realities of work, life and even love at an under-resourced and over-worked cottage hospital.
The TV series shot in southern Sri Lanka stars Amanda Redman, Amrita Archana, James Floyd and our own Nimmi Harasgama.
The Good Karma Hospital to be dubbed in Sinhala
The whole drama is so refreshing to watch and projects humour and entertainment at its best. One could recall the TV series Malgudi Days dubbed and telecast in Sri Lanka some years back when watching The Good Karma Hospital.
It is significant the drama shedding light on a life affirming, optimistic and contemporary story that blends with heart breaking and humour.
TFT member, veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya said The Good Karma Hospital telecast was on ITV PRIME TIME, reaching a record viewership of over seven million households in the UK. He said it has been re-commissioned for a second series to air in 2018 with filming to start in Sri Lanka in August 2017.
We shot this TV series for five months in Galle, Weligama and Hikkaduwa. Colabarative ventures as these are very beneficial to our country as regards flow of foreign money into the country. Local artistes and technicians can enhance the status of their profession by involving in collaborative ventures. They get the opportunity to benchmark with world standards by working with experts. Our own internationally known film personality Errol Kelly is the production designer of The Good KarmaHospital, said Randeniya.
He added, The scenic beauty of our country is projected to the world via collaborative productions thus it is very beneficial to our tourist industry.
Randeniya paid his courtesy to the state sector, police department, education ministry and the media for their support towards this lucrative venture.
TFT member Gopi Dharmaratnam said negotiations are underway with a reviving local TV channel to dub The Good Karma Hospital in Sinhala to be shown to Sri Lankan masses.

Combined efforts by Western, Ayurvedic doctors to curb CKDu in N.C.P
Under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa Programme, priority has been given to providing drinking water to the public, with the aim of curbing the fast spreading kidney disease.
The Chinese government on the request of President Maithripala Sirisena has extended its financial support to realize this venture, said the CM (NCP) Peshala Jayarathna Bandara.
He said this at the inauguration of the newly constructed Medirigiriya Ayurvedic central dispensary. The PC (NCP) has spent Rs. 8.5 million for the completion of the Hospital.
The CM said native medicine and nature were very strongly interconnected . Today we have fallen prey to various health hazards including kidney and heart ailments since we challenge nature and resort to artificial methodologies.
The North Central Ayurvedic Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis said Cabinet had approved the proposal for upgrading the Medirigiriya central Dispensary to an Ayurvedic hospital consisting of a ward complex and other appropriate medical and health care facilities.
He emphasized that it was encouraging that western doctors in the NCP are working together with Ayurvedic and native doctors, to cure CKDu and CKD patients in the region.
North Central Provincial Health Minister K.H. Nandasena, Parliamentarian Sampath Sri Nilantha and Provincial Health Secretary Saman Bandulasena were present at the opening.

For fans of British actor Daniel Craig this might come across as some great news. The actor is reportedly said to be making his appearance as James Bond, after talks with the franchises producer Barbara Broccoli went well, reported DailyMail.co.uk.
Daniel had once stated that he would prefer to slash his own wrists instead of taking up another Bond role. However, Page Six reported that Tom Hiddleston, who was in the running to be the next Bond, might have been ruled out after the producer had a talk with Daniel.
A source also told the publication, Broccoli doesnt like Tom, hes a bit too smug and not tough enough to play James Bond. According to the source, Toms romance with Taylor Swift and his speech where he spoke about aid workers in impoverished South Sudan and how they warmly welcomed him after they watched his TV show, failed to impress Broccoli.

Cricket, the new battleground for protests
Cricket fans were treated to an unusual spectacle at the first T-20 between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the R. Premadasa Stadium when a group of university students took occasion to stage a peaceful protest. The studentsfrom the Moratuwa Universitys Students Union, as evinced by posts on their Facebook pagedecided to use the occasion to protest against the SAITM.
This is not the first time the country has witnessed protests against SAITM these past months. Trade unions, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), the Inter University Student Federation (IUSF), and the Inter University Bhikku Front (IUBF) were among those who organised protests against the private university.
Law enforcement authorities had just the one standard response to these protestors. They used tear gas and water cannons to disperse them, causing havoc and mayhem on the streets, and students ran amok in escape.
It is against this backdrop of regular protests that the protest at the Sri Lanka-Bangladesh T-20 match comes. The students attached to the Moratuwa University Students Union had come to enjoy the match and cheer the country on. But even while cheering Sri Lanka on, they wore t-shirts and carried placards that read Abolish SAITM. They had even worn uniform Anonymous masks. Anonymous is a loosely associated Internet hacktivist organisationwhich may be why the more tech-savvy Moratuwa University students were inclined to wear them.
Their innovative use of the international platform to bring the issue surrounding SAITM to the attention of the common public, however, drew mixed reactions.
The likes of cricket commentator Roshan Abeysinghe were not amused, and tweeted Stupidity has no boundaries. Hence no point commenting. Only sympathise with these kids used as pawns by unscrupulous elements.
Others chimed in, echoing Abeysinghes opinion that a cricket match was not the place to protest. They argued cricket was a sport untouched by bitter national politics and should remain that waya game to be enjoyed, not politicised.
Cricket is one of the countrys greatest uniting factors, when the nation, irrespective of political, ideological, religious, and ethnic differences come together to cheer the country on. It is why the use of a cricket match as a platform to raise awareness on a political issue has come under criticism.
There were those that argued that this kind of action fractured Sri Lankas society. There were those that argued that the anti-SAITM protest sent out a negative message to the international community. They said protests, such as these, tarnished Sri Lankas image in the international arena, giving the impression that ours is a nation riddled with serious socio-economic problems.
But, theres always the flip-side to an argument. Despite the views criticizing the action of university students, many of the comments on Facebook and Twitter were congratulatory: they felt that students, with their uniform Anonymous masks, had used the platform effectively to draw attention to an issue close to heart.
Anti-SAITM protests have typically taken up the streets. Students would enter the streets in hordes, aided and enabled by trade unions and political parties with vested interests. Roads would be blocked, traffic congested, and tear gas canisters and water cannons would be used by law enforcement authorities.
The protest at the R. Premadasa Stadium did none of that: it did not waste the time and money of the public nor the resources of the state.
The Police did not have to use batton charge or other forms of minimum force, nor were the public forced to waste time in traffic during rush hours. This is also, not the first time the cricket arena has been used to make a political statement.
During the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2003, Zimbabwean cricketers Andy Flower and Henry Olonga, wore black armbands to mourn the death of democracy in Zimbabwe, under the presidency of Robert Mugabe.
The black armband protest came under severe criticism from senior Zimbabwean political figures, but was praised by sections of the international media that despised Mugabes presidency.
The International Cricket Council deemed that Flower and Olonga had taken a political action, but refused to charge the pair with an offence. Following the protest, Flower and Olonga were forced to leave Zimbabwe, and they later settled in England.
In 2010, an LTTE supporter carrying an LTTE flag invaded the pitch, while Sri Lanka was playing in England. Similarly, pro-LTTE groups in London have used the occasion of Sri Lanka matches to protest their political cause.
This is not to say cricketor any other sportmust be tainted by politics or that it should become the newest arena for political protests. But using sports events to make political statements is not unprecedented.
Irrespective of the ethics of the protest, one thing is certain: this new form of protest is certainly less taxing than the protests that take up the street.
With all its ills and all the accusations against it, it is a still a form of protest that saves the time and energy of commuters, law enforcement officers, and even protestors themselves, who no longer have to give themselves up to tear gas and water cannons.

A total of 30,486 dengue patients and around 60 deaths were reported during the past three months, Epidemiology Unit sources said.
The highest number of dengue patients, 60,906, was reported from the Colombo district. The second, 3,853, was from the Gampaha district. The Trincomalee district reported 2,820, while Jaffna reported 1,884, the sources said.
The Epidemiology Unit officials warn the public to take precautions against spreading Influenza A(H1N1) because a large number of people shop and visit crowded places during the festive season. They are advised to cover mouth and nose with a handkerchief or a tissue paper whenever they cough and sneeze.
They are advised to avoid touching their eyes, nose, mouth and refrain from spitting in public. Washing hands regularly with soap and water or clean hands with alcohol-based hand rubs, dispose of used tissues/handkerchiefs and wash used handkerchiefs with a germ killer soap/liquid before re-using help avoid infections.
Any one who suffer from fever more than two days should seek prompt medical treatment from a state hospital or from a qualified doctor. No drug other than Paracetamol should be used for fever since doing so may lead to complications, the sources added.

It is my hope that as a nation, following the life and example of Jesus, we would strive this Easter to strengthen the bonds of unity among the different communities and break down the barriers of distrust among us.
The Opposition Leader said Sri Lanka was currently at a crucial juncture in history and he called on all Sri Lankans in the true spirit of Easter, to rise to the challenge, join hands, and work towards creating a future that is marked by justice, peace, hope, and reconciliation for all our people.

Erudition on the decline
Title: Journals of the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka New series volume 61 part 1 and 2: 2016
Editor: Vidyajoti E Walter Marasinghe
Publisher: Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka
The Journals of the Royal Asiatic Society of Sri Lanka (JRAS), Volume 61 Part 1 for the year of 2016 contains three articles, a book review and a tribute. They are : Mahinda Somathilake on Ajanta Murals and their Chronology : A Critical Analysis from pages 1 to 32, Chandana Jayawardene on Counting and Computation Abilities in Early Sri Lanka : A Review based on Buddhist Literature from page 33 to 68 and Sarath Chandrajeewa on Vehragala Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva : An Inquiry into Its Style and Period (The Mahayana Buddhist Bronze Statue in Colombo Museum) from pages 69 to 106, the review by Anad Singh on the book titled : Buddhism at Sranth is found from pages 107 to 110 and the tribute of Hema Goonetileke on Dr. Christopher Reynolds is from pages 111 to 113 of the journal.
At page 3 Somathileke states: Thenceforth, after centuries of neglect, the caves of Ajanta were discovered in the first part of 19th century AD, the earliest recorded visitor being some officers of the Madras Army who saw the paintings in 1819. However Benjamin Rowland in his The Ajanta Caves  Early Buddhist Painting from India UNESCO 1963 at P5 has stated that : In the year 1817 the manoeuvres of a company of British Soldiers resulted in the discovery of the greatest cycle of Indian wall-paintings in the rock-cut cave temples of the Ajanta gorge 
The second comment, which this reviewer wishes to place on record is that the reference found in D. B. Dhanapalas Buddhist paintings from shrines and temples in Ceylon Collins London 1964 on the significance of Ajanta cave Buddhist paintings for Sri Lanka. Though the learned writer attaches a foot note at page 16 of the journal but it is in a different context from the very same book cited by the reviewer i.e. cave 17 paintings on the advent of King Vijaya.
Three scenes found in the cave 17 would have been a merit worthy point of comment for the learned writer at least in a foot note; aptly it is the only place of connection to the Sinhala Culture. The first scene from the Simhala Avadana which depicts: The army on the march, led by Simhala who is riding a white elephant. The second scene also from Simhala Avadana which depicts: Under a tent, Simhala and one of the ogresses, momentarily transformed into a beautiful woman, are conversing while, to the left, other ogresses are engaged in their gruesome practices. The third scene is also from Simhala Avadana which depicts: The sacred horse and its groom. Cave 17 is somewhat is dealt with by Sarath Chandrajeewa at P79-80 in the same issue in his article. The painting on the advent of King Vijaya has had adorned the Sinhala Bauddhaya commemorative issue in 1915.
Buddhist Literature
The third comment which this reviewer wishes to make on this article is that Vini Vitharana in his Sri Lanka  the Geographical Vision Department of Educational Publications Sri Lanka 1996. (The thesis accepted by the University of Ceylon Peradeniya for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy - 1966) at page 195 he states that: Mookerji (1957, 29-30) (History of Indian Shipping) believes that the Jtakas such as the Mahjanaka, Valhassa and Sankha and the story of Vijaya stand evidence to the prevalence of large ship in Sri Lankan waters during the ancient times.
He also presents several bits of sculptural, artistic and numismatic evidence from Snchi, Kanheri, Andhra, Ajant and Borobudur ranging from 2nd century BC to the 11th century AD in support of a claim for the prevalence of extensive shipping in the Indian Ocean (ibid 35, 41-42, 45-50). This reviewer neither sees any iota of material cited by the learned writer on numismatic evidence nor on Mukerji cited to by Vitharana supra.
The second article of Chandana Jayawardene based on Buddhist Literature does not say whether it is published or unpublished literature. The article does not cite the following: B. C. Laws History Pali Literature of Ceylon Vol. I and II London 1933. Louis de Zoysas Catalogue of Pali, Sinhalese, and Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Ceylon Government Oriental Library Colombo 1876 and the Catalogue of Pali, Sinhalese and Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Temple Libraries of Ceylon. Colombo 1885. D. M. de Z. Wickramasinghes Catalogue of Sinhalese Mss in the British Museum London 1900 and the Catalogue of the Sinhalese Printed Books in the Library of the British Museum 1901, A. B. Keiths History of Sanskrit Literature Oxford 1928, W. A. de Silvas Catalogue of Palm Leaf Manuscripts (Memoirs of the Colombo Museum) Vol I 1938, James de Alwiss A Descriptive Catalogue of Sanskrit, Pali and Sinhalese Literary Works of Ceylon, Vol I (1870) 2 and 3, William Skeen Government Printer Colombo and Somapala Jayawardhanas Hand book of Pali Literature Colombo 1994.
Another noteworthy omission is that Wilhelm Geigers Culture of Ceylon in Medieval Times edited by Heinz Bechert Wiesbaden : Otto Harrassowitz 1960 which is not cited to in his article.
The third article is by Sarath Chandrajeewa. This reviewer fervently believes that it is Veheragala where the title is found as Veragala (see: first paragraph it is referred to as Veharagala) How did this error seep in throughout the article
Nandasena Mudiyanse in his Three unpublished Mahyna Bronzes from Ceylon in the British Museum JRASCB Vol XIV, 1970 pages 46 to 49 has described from the Hugh Nevill collection which is assigned the British Museum Registration Members 1898-7-1-135 (figure 1) and 1898-7-1-136 (figure 2) where he has stated that: The deity sits in Maharajalila, the left hand sitting resting on the asana while the right holds a lotus flower in bloom. The left leg hangs down, but the right is bent and is placed on the seat. (emphasis added)
At page 04 of the journal this reviewer finds a photo of the Avalokithesvara Bodhisattva. But curiously at P31 of the journal in Somathilekes article cave 1 part of a photo of Ajanta Cave paintings: Padmapani Bodhisattva typically resembles Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva of Veheragala in Sarath Chandrajeewas article. Sarath Chandrajeewa in his article totally ignores this painting or Nandasena Mudiyanses account cited by this reviewer.
Ajanta murals
This reviewer finds a photograph which appears in the Wikipedia free encyclopaedia on Avalokitesvara Bodhisatva a bronze statue of Avalokitesvara from Sri Lanka CA 750 CE from Burmingham Museum of Art is also not adverted to by Sarath Chandrajeewa in his article.
This reviewer is of the fervent opinion that cave 1 of Ajanta mural painting Padmapni Bodhisattva furnishes the right hand clue of posture of the carrying a flower in statue of Veheragala. Any observer would find that these two have strikingly similar features. Curiously Sarath Chandrajeewa aptly agrees with the reviewer though he has not cited cave 1 painting of the Ajanta murals.
John Clifford Holt in his book titled Buddha in the Crown Avalokitesvara in the Buddhist Tradition of Sri Lanka Oxford University press 1991 states that the first to fourth statues from Tiriyaya cited in his work from Ulrich Von Shroeders book, the figure 12 (Holts) the bronze statuette from Boston Museum belongs to Ananda Coomaraswamys collection, figure 16 of Holt from Natha devale from Kandy all there statues are in lions roar posture  thus lokeshwara features. Nandasena Mudiyanses Mahyna Monuments of Ceylon, M. D. Gunasena Colombo 1967 is not referred to by the learned author. Pl to Pl 14 contains no accreditations to the photographs that appear therein. Did the JRAS violate the copyrights of a previous photographer or an author
The Part 2 of Volume 61 New Series of the JRAS the contents reads as follows: Shanthi Jayawardenes Uri Lankas Tr Devi, from pages 1 to 20, S. Sarath Mathilal de Silvas The Concept of Equality : its Scope, Developments and International Legal Regime from pages 31 to 54, Ramla Wahab-Salmans A History of the Ceylon Moor Press (1882 - 1889) from pages 55 to 70, Susantha Goonetilekes Happiness and the Psychological Contents of Anuradhapura Society from pages 71 to 88 and Uda Hettiges Tribute on Prof. Senaka Bandaranayake from pages 89 to 90. It is evident that JRAS part 2 is a slimmer and contains less pages than the part 1 because it has only ninety pages. JRAS Part 1 is only replete with hundred and twelve pages.
Once this reviewer perused the first article in part 2 volume 61 only he could realize that Uri Lanka is an error for Sri Lanka  it is a printers devil!
This article on Tara devi is on a museum object found in the British Museum. The article neither contains the museum object inventory reference number of figure 1 nor of figure 2 solid cast gilt bronze 0.17 meters Tara Devi.
The writer Shanti Jayawardene has even not attempted to trace at least the museum object number of figure 3 Tara Devi seated found in the National Museum Colombo nor figure 11 Avalokitesvara Tiriyya cited in page 9 JRAS. This reviewer finds it as a sine qua non to identify the museum object by the museum inventory number as the museum inventory contains information that would have furnished the reader of the RAS of the day it reached the museum and how it reached the museum the background of the object of study to the academic or the member of RAS.
The article on Sri Lankas Tr Devi contains figure 1 to figure 27. This reviewer did not find any of these figures are mentioned or referred in the article in parenthesis. The reviewer identifies this as a lapse in the JRAS.
Another salient omission by Shanthi Jayawardene is that he has not referred to U Von Schroeders The Golden Age of Sculpture in Sri Lanka Visual Dharma Publication, Hong Kong 1990. vide: at 90 -1 Samadhi Goddess (no 30) is Jayawardenes figure 3 where National Museum object no. 40.474.144 registered in 1940.
The next comment which the reviewer wishes to make is that a new unaccepted way of writing has emerged by the figures provided therein. That is by mentioning the once who holds the copyright i.e.  British Museum,  National Museum,  Ulrich Von Schroeder,  CCF and  Senake Bandaranayake. This reviewer condemns this mode of writing as it is a sheer violation of the copyright law of the country.
The next article is written by S. Sarath Mathilal de Silva on the The Concept of Equality: Its Scope, Developments and International Legal Regime The writer is identified at the beginning of the article itself as an Attorney-at-Law in which hitherto is not found at the beginning of an article in the JRAS.
National Archives of Ceylon
The third article is by Ramla Wahab-Salman on A History of the Ceylon Moor press (1882-1889) which refers to Orabi Pasha  page 65-6 in the JRAS Part 2. This reviewer finds that a book published by Frewin and Co. Colombo in 1983 titled: Orabi Pasha  The Egyptian Exiles in Ceylon written by A. C. Dep. is not referred to by the writer Wahab  Salman. Arnold Wrights Twentieth Century Impressions of Ceylon 1903 also contains some material on Orabi Pasha. Wahab - Salman has turned a blind eye to the said material. This reviewers next comment is that she even has not referred to Dr. Lorna Dewarajas History of Muslims in Sri Lanka authoritative book published for Muslim of Sri Lanka 1994.

Fiji claim record 17th Hong Kong Sevens title
HONG KONG: Defending champions Fiji clinched a record17th Hong Kong Sevens title on Sunday (Apr 9) after blowing away South Africa to hand new coach Gareth Baber a victory in his former home town.
The Pacific islanders recorded a badly-needed first win on the world series this season as they finally vanquished a post- Olympic hangover, after taking gold in Rio last summer.
Baber has been under huge pressure after taking over mid-season from Ben Ryan, who enjoys legendary status in Fiji after guiding them to their first-ever Olympic medal.
His team triumphed in the city he used to call home when coach of tournament hosts Hong Kong, with whom he agonisingly missed out on securing promotion to the world series last year.
But there was no hint of nerves as he returned to the biggest venue of the sevens circuit. His charges swept away South Africa 22-0 with four unanswered tries, including two spectacular second-half scores from Kalione Nasoko who was named player of the final.
Theres huge expectation with Fiji - they are the world champions, the Olympic champions for a reason, Baber said.
When you look back on your career as a coach or player, there are moments where perhaps things didnt go so right, and they make perhaps coming back to the scene of the crime and doing it well that bit more special.
DREAM TO PLAY IN HONG KONG
He added: I love being here in Hong Kong ... I thoroughly developed my coaching here and now I come back and put it out for everybody to see with a great group of people and a great country as well.
Sevens is Fijis national sport and the team enjoy a phenomenal record in Hong Kong, winning five of the last six tournaments.
Fiji captain Osea Kolinisau said: Every young Fijian grows up dreaming to play one day in Hong Kong.
He added: Im stoked for Gareth. I know hes been under the thumb, a lot of pressure, people questioning his credentials ... its special for him to come back to Hong Kong and to get his first title.
South Africa must wait another year to try and claim their first sevens title in Hong Kong. But the Blitzboks remain top of the standings with 145 points, with Fiji leapfrogging England to claim second place on 122 points with three events still to play. Coach Neil Powell said he had fielded a young squad after losing several experienced players to injury but admitted his team was beaten fair and square.
Hong Kong was the seventh of 10 tournaments in the global series, with Singapore hosting the next leg before it ends in May in Paris and London.
They (Fiji) will definitely come out guns blazing in Singapore to see if they can close that gap - we need another strong performance in Singapore next weekend, Powell said.
Australia overcame a talented USA side - who overpowered England in the quarterfinals and pushed South Africa to extra time in the semis - to claim third place.
USA coach Mike Friday admitted he was frustrated with the loss but added: Its an unbelievable sevens tournament, unbelievable carnival and celebration of rugby, and the world does come to play here. - AFP

Finance Minister visits supermarkets to check on prices
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake made surprise visits to several super markets in Colombo on April 9 to ascertain whether they maintain standard commodity prices.
The minister talked to consumers and enquired them about commodity prices. Many consumer goods were sold at ordinary prices but certain super marketers were selling canned fish, sprats and powdered milk packets at different prices. The minister informed the Consumer Affairs Authority in this regard.
We engaged in a similar surprise visit to Colombo wholesale market recently and, enquired about prices of consumer goods in the market. Later we worked out how much should be the price of each item when it reaches the retail outlets. During this visit, we came to know that not only the ordinary retail shops but also super markets sell goods at lower prices, the minister said.
Several places sold goods at high prices. We complained about such places to the Consumer Affairs Authority. Price differences were observed in powered milk and specially sprats, though price of sprats is already controlled. However, 80 - 85 percent of goods are sold under low prices, he said.
The minister said a relief sack of essential items will be provided to consumers with effect from tomorrow. The sack of 10 items worth Rs.1,515 will be provided at Rs.975 under the programme during the New Year season until April 20. Potatoes, big onion, rice, sprats, sugar, canned fish, chopped chilies, gram and powdered milk will include in the relief package. One million sacks will be distributed throughout the country and it costs the Ministry Rs. 540 million.
We cleared that there is no shortage of consumer items in the market as charged by bankrupted politicians. Therefore, it is the duty of the media to disseminate this message to the people in this country. A rice kg was sold at Rs.110 at the time we assumed power on January 8, 2015. When it is dropped to Rs.75, they shout. Dhal was Rs.230240 at that time, and it is Rs.157 today, he said.
Powdered milk was Rs. 425 at that time; it is Rs.210300 today. Fuel and LP Gas are available at reduced rates today. A cylinder of LP Gas was sold at Rs.2,635 at that time and it is dropped to Rs.1350 today. Kerosene was Rs. 80 at that time and it is Rs.45 today. Relief has been brought to the ordinary people today. These current prices should be further reduced. A programme is afoot under the guidance of the President and the Prime Minister to make that programme a success, the minister said.
MPs Kavinda Jayawardana and Harshana Rajakaruna were present.

Frozen moments of a winning partnership
The Australian High Commission launched a photography exhibition at the Lionel Wendt Gallery on April 5 to celebrate the 70 years of development cooperation between Australia and Sri Lanka.
The exhibition, which was comprised of over 50 photographs, highlights the projects that have benefited Sri Lankans in the areas of health, education, employment, and sport, among others. Most of the pictures were taken after the end of the civil conflict, but there was also a selection of vintage black and white photos featuring a variety of scenes of Sri Lankan-Australian friendship.
The lions share of the photos, however, captured the recipients of Australian aid, such as fishermen with boats and citizens in rebuilt homes. Pictures of children, women, and the elderly feature prominently. Most of the documented projects were carried out in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
Particular highlights includes portraits of those who received loans to start a cinnamon oil mill and those of a female de-mining team trained by Delvon Assistance for Social Harmony (DASH) and funded by Australia. These snapshots capture women with heavy demining equipment. The accompanying captions describe the tedious, stifling, and heroic work of clearing mines throughout the country.
Though most of the photographs subjects are aid recipients, there are a few of Australian diplomats interacting with locals. One excellent photo is of Kathy Klugman, former Australian High Commissioner, at the opening of rebuilt homes for resettled families.
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australias Minister for International Development and the Pacific, launched the opening, and noted that Australia has supported Sri Lankas development over the course of the countries bilateral relationship. She added, however, that Australia is ready, willing, and able to help Sri Lanka continue its development.
Many of our new programs focus on partnering with the private sector in innovative ways to create more quality jobs and opportunities for all Sri Lankans, especially women, she said. She added that Australia would continue to support young Sri Lankans to study at its universities.
We are proud to support the next generations of Sri Lankas leaders with a world-class education in Australia said Minister Fierravanti-Wells.
The opening itself was a stylish affair, as representatives from NGOs, foreign embassies and high commissions, and members of the local community viewed the photographs over canaps and fine wines.
The exhibition is now closed, but it will be open to the public from April 21 to 23 at the Lionel Wendt Gallery, Colombo 7.

Residents of the Siriwardena Mawatha near the Ragama railway station complain that the garbage dumped in the area has caused them a serious health hazard. The garbage dumped all over the area permeates unbearable foul smell, they said.
Environmental pollution resulted by garbage dumped recklessly has a direct link with the high number of reported dengue patients in the area, they said.
Several dengue deaths including that of a 7-year-old girl were reported recently.
The residents urge authorities to take immediate action to prevent people from dumping garbage since it would lead to dengue epidemic situation in the area in the near future.

Garcia beats Rose to claim Masters Green Jacket
AUGUSTA: Spains Sergio Garcia ended nearly two decades of major disappointment when he beat Englands Justin Rose in a playoff to win the U.S. Masters on Sunday, donning the Green Jacket on what would have been the 60th birthday of his hero, the late Seve Ballesteros.
After 73 majors, four heartbreaking runner-up finishes and years of self doubt, Garcia finally delivered the long awaited title when his 12-foot birdie putt at the first extra hole dropped into the cup at the par-four 18th, triggering a massive cheer from a gallery that had been on the edge of their seats.
Deadlocked after nine holes, the two friends and rivals produced an enthralling back nine showdown worthy of any Masters champion in what became a head-to-head battle.
Garcia and Rose both carded 69 to finish tied on nine-under-par 279 at the end of regulation and send the years first major to a playoff when both missed birdie putts and settled for pars at the 72nd hole.
It marked the first Masters playoff since Adam Scott beat Angel Cabrera to become the first Australian to wear the Green Jacket in 2013 at Augusta National.
All the omens had seemed in place for a Spanish victory with Garcia starting the day perched atop the leaderboard alongside Rose on Ballesteross 60th birthday.
Ballesteros, the Spanish talisman who died of brain cancer in 2011, inspired a generation of golfers in his country, winning Green Jacket twice in 1980 and 1983.
Garcia becomes the third Spaniard to wear the Green Jacket, joining Jose Maria Olazabal, who also triumphed twice at Augusta, in 1994 and 1999.
It is amazing. To do it on his (Ballesteross) 60th birthday and to join him and Jose Maria Olazabal, my two idols in golf, it is something amazing, said Garcia before accepting the Green Jacket from last years winner Danny Willett in Butler Cabin.
Jose Maria texted on Thursday saying how much he believed in me and to believe in myself.
Everybody has been great. My whole family, my fiance.
Garcia, who has been plagued by self doubt when it came to majors, once said he did not have what it takes to be a major champion but demonstrated on Sunday during an enthralling rollercoaster battle with Rose that he does indeed possess the tools, demeanour and determination of a champion. - Agencies

GMOAs political project
GMOA big gun Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya on Friday left no one in doubt about his political affiliations. He has from time to time betrayed the fact he is a Rajapaksa sympathizer, though not in explicit terms. But, during his speech, opposite the Fort Railway Station, on Friday, in the middle of the doctors strike Padeniya who is given to fiery speeches, like a politician in full cry, surpassed himself when he used uncouth language that was unbecoming of a member of the medical profession. Laying into the Yahapalanaya government, Padeniya, in an obvious reference to the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister, went onto describe them as amanayo for their unyielding stand on the SAITM issue. What is more, Padeniya also dealt a broadside even on the countrys justice system querying as to what is the point of having courts if it cannot deliver proper judgements. The image created by Padeniya on Friday is the furthest one could have of a member of the medical profession. It also revealed the GMOA to be just like any other Trade Union whose members gather at Liptons Circus shouting slogans.
It has been the GMOAs professed stand hat it did not support any political party but fought for the issues confronting the medical profession and the rights of patients. However the speech made by Padeniya and others in the GMOA on Friday left no doubt that the doctors Trade Union was working to a political agenda and were in fact foot soldiers of the Rajapaksas. The tone and tenor of some of its members and the hatred betrayed by its office bearers during press conferences and public speeches leaves little doubt as to where the sympathies of the GMOA lay. This is also confirmed in the doctors venturing out into extraneous issues such as ETCA which certainly is not the province of members of the medical profession. The GMOA, has, all but shed any pretenses of being a Trade Union with no political affiliations and shown itself to be wedded to the campaign to bring the Rajapaksas back to power. It is no secret that prominent members of the GMOA enjoyed special privileges under Mahinda Rajapaksa, and what is more, the GMOA openly campaigned for the election of MR. It is also revealing how mute the GMOA was during the Rajapaksa presidency where no notable protest or demonstrations took place. It is time the GMOAs true face was exposed.
SAITM was not the creation of the Yahapalanaya government but was established during the Rajapaksa era. Not only that, Mahinda Rajapaksa also requested that scholarships be awarded by SAITM to deserving students. What was the GMOA doing then Did the likes of Padeniya let out fire and brimstone, like he did on Friday, when the SAITM was operating without let or hindrance under Rajapaksa. Or, as Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said, was the GMOA in mortal fear of Gota and was only now disporting themselves like cardboard heroes Did the doctors make even a whimper of protest when the Kotalawala Defence Academy, that was under the then Defence Secretary, was given the license to confer medical degrees Why only target SAITM Do members of the GMOA fear a new class of doctors emerging from SAITM to challenge their dominance Like Minister Kiriella said, the GMOA has no right to interfere in Sri Lankas medical education. As it is, the country is badly hit by a dearth of medical practitioners and matters can only further aggravate, with all medical faculties in state universities closed as a result of the anti-SAITM protest. The GMOA should squarely take the blame for inciting students to take to the streets, blighting their future. Today, it is not just the medical students but even ordinary schoolchildren, with no inkling of the SAITM issue, too have been co-opted into the anti-SAITM campaign. Even a candlelight vigil was held the other day in Fort, with little children participating, giving the impression that SAITM is the biggest issue confronting the country. Obviously, a large sum of money has been pumped into the whole project which has taken on a virulent anti-government hue.
Now that the GMOA has unraveled itself in no uncertain terms, and shown its hand, the government should not compromise on SAITM or any other unreasonable demand by the doctors. It should certainly not be allowed to meddle into affairs not medical. We say this because the doctors are bound to come out with all guns firing when the ETCA is signed in the coming months. Members of the medical profession cannot tell the government how to run the countrys economy. Fridays strike and protest meeting may well be a trial balloon with more agitations in the offing, led by the GMOA. The doctors are certainly going all out to cause public disaffection towards the government, with elections round the corner. There is nothing more that could direct the public ire on a government than the plight of poor patients going without treatment, as shown on television, every time the doctors go on strike.

Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday accused the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) of pursuing a political agenda.
Minister Kiriella speaking at a public event in Ulladupitiya, Harispattuwa said the GMOA in the past had backed the former President Mahinda Rajapaksas political campaigns and now they were doing their utmost to put the Yahapalna government into difficulty. Kiriella said the GMOA had kept silent when the Malabe private medical college was given Rs. 600m during the former Presidents time in 2011. The Minister said the GMOA had no legal right to intervene in the issues relating to the private medical college.
Measures have been taken to address the issues relating to the quality of medical education offered by the institution, he said.
The Minister said the Sri Lanka Medical Council will come up with the required minimum standards, and the Government was prepared to take over the Neville Fernando Hospital and run it as a state hospital if required.

Hells-bells peal out at disruptions of nuptials!
Funny moments seem to crop up at certain weddings I have been privileged to attend over the years. What makes them so humorous is that they are unexpected and arent supposed to happen.
In my youth I was accorded the singular honour of being chosen as the Best Man by more than a dozen bridegrooms. No small wonder then that I have seen more than my fair share of wedding disasters and side-splitting cameos enacted that set events into a whirligig of fun.
Nobody knows better than I that even the most meticulously mapped out wedding plans can turn into total disarray. All it takes is to set a tiny spark to trigger a powder-keg situation that erupts in laughter. I have been both behind the scenes and in the forefront of so many weddings and have witnessed some of the wildest and weirdest goings-on imaginable.
Now veteran Best Men such as I are hardly intimidated by any sort of hustle and bustle and are great guys to have at your side when things go wrong. All this brings me to the exciting subject of elopements and runaway brides. You see the original duty of a Best Manwas to serve as armed backup for the groom in case he had to resort to kidnapping his intended bride away from disapproving parents. The best part of that title refers to his skill with a sword, should the need arise.
As in medieval times I have twice served in this role quite admirably, sans the swashbuckling swordplay, of course. The most effective weapon in my arsenal was my rapier wit combined with a two-fisted punching ability. Now tradition has it that the Best Man stands guard next to the groom right up through the exchange of vows and later outside the newly-weds bedroom door.
As mentioned earlier I was obliged to perform the former function a dozen times with due diligence. But I desisted from executing the honeymoon suite vigil. Still it seemed like a load of fun to organise a bit of a conspiracy with the groomsmen to knock on the honeymooners door and announce loudly: Room service!
The moment the exasperated groom opened the door the entire insufferable bunch would barge in and demand that the groom join his attendants in finishing off an entire bottle.
There was the unforgettable incident when a terrified friend of mine named Gaspar made an emergency midnight call at my home. Trembling with trepidation he explained that his girlfriends father had threatened to fill him full of buckshot unless he agreed to marry his daughter within the week.
So the following evening, armed with a bottle of premium liquor, we paid the old boy a visit. Gaspar gasped out his request for an eight-month reprieve. Following a slug or three of the good stuff all differences were sunk and the old boy was transformed into the epitome of the convivial father-figure.
At the end of the discussion he began waxing poetic saying: My son, my son, this will be a match made in Heaven. Gaspar and I did not dare express our contradictory thoughts that it appeared more like a match made in the other hot place.
Yes siree, I have seen them all, from shotgun weddings to reception crashers to groom, and groomsman becoming utterly un-groomed and staggeringly unsteady as a result of the stag party the night before. It is a time in which both the groom and his retinue are all struggling with pre-marital jitters which is a completely normal phenomenon.
Just three hours before the church ceremony the groom elect, my friend Desi, suffered what seemed the worst attack of cold feet I have ever witnessed as an attending best man. He was still tormented from the effects of his stag bash.
His two groomsmen and I could not fathom whether his anxiety was triggered by stress over the wedding planning or about the marriage itself. Yet what was abundantly clear was that poor Desi was a raging bundle of nerves. Attempting to calm himself he made the mistake of downing a couple of more shots of vodka which made matters far worse.
We were now faced with the terrifying prospect that the wedding would have to be called off. He was hardly in a fit state to walk up the aisle much less sit up straight. So we tried every trick in the book as well as out of it to sober him up.
The methods ranged from frog-matching him into a cold shower over and over again while force-feeding him copious quantities of iced water, lime juice and strong black coffee. With only an hour to go he finally threw up, regurgitating gallons of double distilled grog reminiscent of an oil gusher.
He was cold-showered again and forced to brush his teeth although he did seem still a bit groggy. He was then marinated in aftershave before we helped him slide into his tuxedo. Only the red in his eyes gave away any evidence of the ravages of the monumental binge he had suffered the night before. Except for a hysterical giggle the tension and stress appeared to have left him. He seemed well and truly unplastered.
All seemed to go well as we marched down the aisle. The ceremony appeared to be a pretty smooth affair until it came to the part of the wedding vows where Desi when asked by the priest about the for better or for worse part giggled and exclaimed: Ill try! And when asked to repeat after the priest the words love and trust he said: shove and lust!
But all hell broke loose when it came for the five-year-old ring bearer to approach the couple. The whole episode seemed like a few clowns short of a circus as he then took the cushion with the ring and flung it at the little flower girl who had been making faces at him. It took a groomsman a good while to find it while crawling on his hands and knees.
He then returned with the ring and made the gravest mistake of his life by pulling the recalcitrant brats ear. The little bounder stepped aside and kicked his attacker squarely on his shin. Then as his adversary bent he let off with a mighty unnerving, Hiyy-ahh! At the same time he executed an unerring and unexpected snap-kick to his tormentors mid-section. And the moral of the story Never raise your hand to a feisty kid. It leaves your groin unprotected.
You could hear the crunching sound of impact distinctly on the wedding video. A ding-a-ling-a-ling bells of hell thwack! The groomsman was now rolling around on the ground, clutching his bruised gonads, cursing under his breath and humming sweet hymns in a soprano-like voice.

India poised to become worlds third largest economy, power
India is the world's fastest growing major economy. By 2050 it will be the planet's most populous nation.
As it attempts economic transformation, India needs everything from infrastructure to energy and education  the latter two imports which already dominate its trade with Australia.
But more than any material demands, what India wants is recognition  as a country poised to become the world's third largest economy, and a power in its own right.
As Malcolm Turnbull visits India for meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and business leaders, he is talking up the "tremendous opportunity" the nation's growth represents for Australia.
Taken for granted
When Indian and Australian politicians stand up to give speeches in each others' countries, you bet on hearing "India and Australia have much in common".
Perhaps. But "cricket, Commonwealth and curry" as an old adage went, is not how 21st century India sees itself, or its relationship with Australia. (Perhaps with the exception of wanting to remain the number one Test team).
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to make India a great power, one which commands international respect in its own right, not merely as a balance to regional rival China.
His path to this goal is India's burgeoning youth  he wants to train and skill them to make and do things which are globally valued, and in doing so lure foreign investment in India and transform the nation's economy.
"He [Prime Minister Modi] has changed the way Indians look at themselves," said Dr. Anirban Ganguli, director of the Government-aligned think tank, the Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee Research Foundation.

This might seem simple, but openly courting foreign investment the way Modi has represents a significant shift in postcolonial India.
"Earlier, we were very ambiguous in this  'should we, shouldn't we'  and I think this was due to our colonial past," Dr Ganguli said.
"There's this national sense that we don't want to be exploited."
Following centuries of mercantilism under British rule, in 1947 newly-independent India turned away from trade, opting for a planned economy on the socialist principle of self-reliance.
Dr Ganguli says this explains India's notoriously bureaucratic restrictions on commerce and foreign investment, which only began to be dismantled in the 90s.
"So I think there was a lot of ambiguity, and it didn't allow us to clearly state, 'What is it that we want' as you've asked me," he said.
For the Government to foster risk-taking entrepreneurship, provide incentives for start-ups and actively encourage foreign companies to set up shop in India is significant, he said.
Where does Australia fit
Modi's answer to the exploitation fear is to encourage skilled manufacturing and services  to move India's goods and services exports higher up the value chain from garments or call centres.
"[Prime Minister Modi] has used this term, 'human resource superpower,' in terms of economy and manufacturing," Dr Ganguli said.
"It is this young India, this new India which needs training, which needs opportunity.
"[There is] this huge emphasis on skilling the population  where Australia plays, or expected to play a great role."
Foreign students are a $20 billion business for Australia. Last year 61,000 Indian students headed Down Under, making Australia the second-most popular destination for Indians behind America.
Critical for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Education Minister Simon Birmingham is enabling Australia's institutions to reach further into India, where they can teach those who lack the means to study abroad. Birmingham said Australia's focus is now shifting to "how it is we can help Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government to skill some 400 million people by 2020".
Foreign educators are still not allowed to set up campuses under their own name in India, but partnerships and collaboration agreements are proliferating.
Birmingham said Australia will make the case for easing restrictions.
"Enhanced mutual recognition of Australian qualifications as well as better access for Australian education and training providers into India, to help them meet their targets to build their capacity and their economy," he said.
And what about turning the lights on
Turnbull will meet Adani chairman Gautam Adani while in India.
Adani's board is due to decide this month whether to proceed with the controversial $21 billion Carmichael coal mine in Queensland's Galilee basin. The project has state and federal Government support in Australia and the company says it will help provide cheap power for Indians still living without electricity.
But environmental protesters have threatened to disrupt construction and the plan to import coal runs contrary to India'sOffice of Fair Tradingstated goal of coal self-sufficiency.
Asked on Sunday if he will be promoting the project, Turnbull replied "we'll certainly be talking about the importance of energy exports to India".
"As you know India has a massive program of expanding electrification across the country and Australian coal has a very big role to play in that," he said.
The nuclear option
It is two years since India and Australia signed a supply treaty. This visit is expected to herald the first Australian uranium shipments to India under that deal.
When Resources Minister Matthew Canavan visited India last month, he told the ABC that he was "very confident" uranium sales were finally set to begin.
"I know of some very well-developed and keen interest," Canavan said.

India sends water, rice as Sri Lanka faces severe drought
With Sri Lanka experiencing one of the worst droughts in the last four decades, India has provided emergency assistance of water and rice to Sri Lanka. The government has already handed over eight water bowsers to the Sri Lankan authorities and the consignment of rice would be delivered soon.In response to a request from the Sri Lankan government for drought relief assistance, the Indian government had announced the decision to provide eight water bowsers and 100 metric tonnes of rice to Sri Lanka.
The supply of these items is in the nature of emergency assistance to augment relief measures undertaken in the wake of the severe drought faced by Sri Lanka, Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj told Parliament in a written reply.
The lorry-mounted water bowsers were given to the Sri Lankan government on March 21. India has always been among the first to respond to requests from the neighbouring countries in times of crisis.
The current gifting of the water bowsers and rice is part of that policy, Swaraj added.
Sri Lanka is suffering from the worst drought in 40 years with over a million people facing acute water shortages. The country has experienced prolonged dry season with some districts having 60 to70 percent less rainfall. The local wells and reservoirs are running dry.The harvest of rice is going to be hit due to water shortage and the prospect of rice shortage later this year is looming large.

A countrywide carbonic cultivation programme has been initiated under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The minister told Daily News that a testing carbonic cultivation programme conducted in the Kottankattuwa village in the Kantale area has proved the advantages of carbonic paddy cultivation. He said 194 bushels of paddy were secured at a cost of Rs. 34,250 from a single acre paddy field cultivated with carbonic fertiliser.
An acre of paddy grown with chemical fertiliser yields only 165 bushels and it costs Rs. 40,500, the minister said.
"Therefore, we initiated an island-wide carbonic cultivation programme from Mihintale, Wellaragama and 250 farmers families participate in it. Two thousands acres will be used for the project. The farmers are provided with seed varieties, and agriculture appliances among others.
A carbonic fertiliser plant will be established at Wellaragama.
A carbonic cultivation colony that will produce 100 percent chemical free food crops will be established by 2019, the minister said.

A journey of soul search,
He is widely known as Rohantha Reggae. Hailing from a little town nestled in the chilly Nuwara Eliya, Rohantha was studying for his A/Ls in Mathematics stream at St. Anthonys College in Kandy when an idea urged him to rediscover his aspirations.
This was an idea that would take him on a long winding journey for several decades, across the island and beyond the seven seas.
I wanted to explore various subjects and discover a means to heal people. Sri Lanka is a tropical island and it draws a lot of people with spiritual energy. I became interested in music and started listening to different genres like pop, jazz, rock and reggae. And little by little I was drawn to Reggae, to the life story of Bob Marley and their way of life. Reggae is like a ladder, where you cant see its end. So I decided to learn reggae music, make it popular in my home country and compose my own songs.
During the many years of self-studying, experimenting and research, Rohantha kept tabs on the local Reggae scene and when he realized that authentic music has yet to reach the local fans, he decided to step forward with his own style of Reggae - marking the birth of Rohantha Reggae.
With an ad-hoc band he groomed himself and an unwavering passion for music, Rohantha made his debut appearance gaining recognition and popularity following his first performance. Reigniting the spark of soul search, he once set off on a quest for the origins of music, and continued traveling to many countries visiting the original homes of the worlds top musicians including Mozart.
While studying and experimenting the scope of music, Rohantha continued his higher education in Engineering. A long journey has seen to him performing at every university in Sri Lanka, in small towns and big cities, street corners as well as glitzy clubs - with the same inimitable passion to share the spirit of music.
An artiste of one of a kind calibre, Rohantha has rediscovered music as a lifestyle and a spiritually uplifting experience, rather than a vocational education. He has travelled far and wide cross borders from the orient to the west, gaining deep insight into multifarious cultures and music styles while learning different languages. This comprehensive experience and knowhow led him to compose songs incorporating eclectic language phrases, transcending time, space as well as boundaries to spread his message loud and clear.
Rohantha released his debut album in 2000, and since then he has released scores of songs warmly embraced by his fans across the globe. He believes that through reggae music he has spiritually become closer to nature, and can feel the pulse of people.
Expressing his views on the distinctive Rasta appearance he said, I have met Rishis (sages) and Sadhus (ascetic persons) when I travelled to Rishikesh and Himachal areas in northern India. It was a sight to behold, these holy men wearing dreadlocks, just like the Rastafarians from Jamaica. Dreadlocks do not belong to one country, ethnicity or religion, but its a universal attribute. Rastafari was originally a religion, a culture and a way of life, which later became popular through Bob Marley and his reggae influence across the globe. Rastas love nature and everything about humanity.
They live by the two words - Love and Respect and Reggae is about One Love. It has become my mission to inspire many people, across generations, from the richest to the poorest.
As a composer, lyricist, musician and researcher - Rohantha says he is closer to realizing his ultimate dream. After embarking on a world tour, he said he is finally prepared to visit Kingston, Jamaica - the very town which nestles the residence of the timeless legend - Bob Marley. Rohantha has fondly named his own residence as Kingston long ago with a strong desire to visit the legendary Bob Marleys home in future.
Before commencing his world tour, Rohantha was back in the island to perform for his fans in the commercial capital.
Joining the Colombo Hippie Market held in Kolamba Kamatha, BMICH Recently, Rohantha performed with true zest and passion kindling the spirit of reggae to the delight of the crowds.
While touring the country, Avi and the Hippie Market team approached me and we had a discussion to hold special reggae sessions. Ive been to Hippie Markets in Goa, San Francisco and some European countries.
I was really excited to join the local Hippie Market and its really nice to see the especially the young generation embracing the world cultures. So this is like a learning experience for them, to learn music, cultures and lifestyles of a bygone era. And theres also a special coincidence, I performed once at a Hippie Market in Goa on March 26, 2012, and here I find myself performing again on 26th March 2017 at a Hippie Market in Colombo. This is called positive vibrations.
Concluding his thoughts Rohantha said that he feels like the tiny seed he planted decades ago has grown into a soaring tree. And if anyone aspires for something, they should set aside the little doubts and hesitations and pursue their dreams with strong determination.

JVP protest Trincomalee MoU with India

JVP leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that JVP will stage an island wide strike with the participation of all trade unions against the government's attempt to sell the Trincomalee oil tanks to the Indian Oil Company.
He made these observations today at a press conference held at the JVP Political Head Office in Pelawatta, Battaramulla.
He also said Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama will go to India in April and ink an agreement in this connection. He also said that the JVP has filed a case in this connection as well.
"The UNP government in 2003 entered into an agreement to lease those Oil Tanks in Trincomalee to the IOC which has a capacity of 1 million MT," MP Dissanayake said. "Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody pointed out according to the first MOU between the IOC and the government, a proper lease agreement has to be signed within six months of the MOU which was not fulfilled.
Due to this reason he has tendered a cabinet paper requesting to hand over oil tanks back to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) which later was approved."
MP Dissanayake said that however the Premier Wickremesinghe has again tendered a cabinet to cancel it and to develop them as a joint venture between CPC and IOC. 
"Minister Malik Samarawickrama is to go to India in April and sign an agreement in this connection," MP Dissanayake said. "We will protest against this. These oil tanks have a capacity than Orugodawatta and Muthurajawela oil tanks which is 0.4 MT million altogether. If we use those tanks to store the oil needed to Anurdhapura, Vavunia, Polonnoruwa Kilinochchi and other areas in North and East we could have saved more than Rs 1000 million a year."
He added that however the government had to hire oil tanks from the IOC during 2005 to 2009 to store oil needed for the security forces and the use of the civilians there.
"The Government had to pay a sum of Rs 692 million to IOC during that period," MP Dissanayake said.
"But the government earned only Rs 75 million during the corresponding years."
JVP Parliamentarian Dr Nalinda Jayathissa also participated at the press conference.

La La Land : Surrender to the music!
You often get a high when you have experienced something really good. It may be a hearty meal comprising you all time favourite dishes or experiencing a rare moment which stays with you in your mind forever in the years to come. It can even be experienced if you have watched an exceptionally good work of art.
Damien Chazelles award winning La La Land falls into this category. You not only get carried away by the heart tugging storyline but it is mostly the music in this ace musical which takes your breath away. These numbers make your heart swell, which is what the best musicals do. And best of all it is a musical which makes us yearn for more musicals  rejuvenating a tradition of yesteryear Hollywood.
Close to home
The movie is pretty much about us  the audience living in the modern world. It is about what we have become due to the circumstances around us. It is more about the dream factory from which its title derives  Hollywood, LA. It is a place close to home yet so far at the same time.
He is a passionate jazz pianist and she is an aspiring actress and playwright. After a couple of false starts, chance encounters, long walks in the moonlight, clever banter and countless gazing into each others eyes, Mia and Sebastian realize that they have fallen for each other. Love takes them on a beautiful fantasy until reality brings them back onto the ground.
Mixing the feel good moments and the melancholic moments from the musical traditions is one of the most fascinating aspects of La La Land. You get a feel of hits like Singin In The Rain, The Band Wagon and Funny Girl, Oliver! fused with gloomy instances which remind you of Chicago and A Star is Born. That gentle whistling, enchanting colours, old world mood, vintage styling and choreography of that magical melody sucked us into the world of La La Land with ease.
Main attraction
Pairing Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone who scorched the screen together with their chemistry in Crazy, Stupid Love was the main attraction which won the audience over. Their performances and chemistry is truly remarkable.
Shot by Linus Sandgren in Cinemascope La La Land captures the scenic beauty of the city beautifully. Los Angeles has never looked so good, and neither have its many iconic, cinematic locations that the movie twists and twirls between.
La Land makes you think about the grand old staple of Hollywood - musicals again. However this time the productions have been jazzed up with technology, psychology and more. It takes our breath away and makes us want more.
La La Land is screening at Majestic Cineplex.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in a message released for Easter, said the season on Lent teaches the meaning of sacrificial love, depicted in the life of Christ.
Jesus Christ was and is one of the greatest teachers of history, whose message of love and compassion has touched hearts and transformed lives of people throughout the ages, the message read.
The Cross was a challenge to the political and the religious hierarchy of the day; the Cross continues to challenge Christians to herald in change in keeping with the doctrine Christ preached - that of love, compassion and forgiveness.
The season of Lent teaches them the meaning of sacrificial love that was so poignantly depicted in the life of Christ.
Christians observe Good Friday at the foot of the Cross and rejoice in the resurrection of Christ on Easter Day - symbolising the victory of justice, mercy and forgiveness that form the foundation of selfless living Christ preached, the message read.
May Christians everywhere truly experience the joy of resurrection and love for fellow mankind this Easter.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has been made the youngest ever UN Messenger of Peace.
The 19-year-old, who is doing her A-levels and has an offer from a top UK university, will take the role with a special focus on girls' education.
In 2012 Yousafzai was nearly killed by the Taliban for campaigning for girls' rights to education.
Accepting the accolade in New York, she said: "(Bringing change) starts with us and it should start now."
"If you want to see your future bright, you have to start working now (and) not wait for anyone else," he said.
United Nations secretary-general Antonio Guterres described her as a "symbol of perhaps the most important thing in the world - education for all".
Last month, Yousafzai said she had received an offer tostudy politics, philosophy and economicsat a UK university, on condition of achieving three As in her A-levels.
Yousafzai, who narrowly escaped death after being attacked on her way home from school in Pakistan, did not confirm which university had made the offer.
But previously she revealed she had interviewed for a degree place at an Oxford college.
UN Messengers of Peace are selected from the fields of art, literature, science, entertainment, sports or other fields of public life.
Other messengers have included Muhammad Ali, George Clooney, Michael Douglas, Leonardo DiCaprio, Stevie Wonder and Charlize Theron.

Animation and the director of Madagascar invite you to meet a most unusual baby. He wears a suit, speaks with the voice and wit of Alec Baldwin, and stars in the animated comedy, DreamWorks The Boss Baby. The Boss Baby is a hilariously universal story about how a new babys arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator, a wildly imaginative 7 year old named Tim. With a sly, heart-filled message about the importance of family, DreamWorks The Boss Baby is an authentic and broadly appealing original comedy for all ages. This unusual animated film is bolstered by a unique visual flair with important lessons for children in the audience.
The Boss Baby is screened at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm, 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.

Minister Senasinghe to participate at Harvard University meeting
Sujeewa Senasinghe, State Minister for International Trade has been formally invited for the second time to attend a prestigious meeting at the Centre for International Development (CID) at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.
This latest programme is a platform where 100 leading international policymakers, Chief Executive Officers, Heads of foundations and multilateral organizations and development experts will meet and discuss important issues relating to global sustainable development and prosperity.
Furthermore the conference known as Global Empowerment Meeting (GEM17) will examine innovations and inspire discussion towards joint action to address these issues.
The discussion will largely focus on moral foundations and societal identities and how these forces play an important part in policy making and setting priorities in today's development agenda.
Among the leading speakers are Robert Wright, Bestselling author and journalist; Dani Rodrik, Professor of International Political Economy at Harvard, Joshua Greene, Professor of Psychology and Director of the Moral Cognition Lab at Harvard; Maria Ramos, CEO of Barclays Africa Group Limited: Michele Lamont, Director of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs and Mark Blyth, Professor of Political Economy at Brown University.
Sujeewa Senasinghehas had a strong connection with Harvard University's Centre for Economic Development (CID) having participated earlier in August to September 2016 at an Executive Education Programme titled "Mastering Trade Policy: Understanding and Acting in Today's Economy" which was initiated by Prof. Robert Z Lawrence of Harvard University.
Hence the participation by the State Minister at the 9th annual Global Empowerment Meeting will be an excellent opportunity for him to interact with many leading figures in a wide spectrum of specializations and to make a strong case in favour of Sri Lanka as a partner for trade and for Foreign Direct Investment.

No government gave due place to local entrepreneurs - Minister Gamage
Successive governments have unfortunately failed to give the place due for local entrepreneurs, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage said.
He was speaking at a meeting in Colombo recently of the Public Commission to formulate a national policy on international trade.
Gamage said the Kantale Sugar and the newly established Bibile Sugar companies could have been run by local investors, but both had been handed over to a Singaporean company.
He said ministers were not consulted when taking certain government decisions, which left them helpless. As a country, national interests should be safeguarded when signing international agreements, he said.
Gamage pointed out that the export revenue, which stood at 37% of the GDP in 2005, has now declined to 14% due to the depreciation of the rupee and other reasons.All should unite to raise export revenue, strengthen all other sectors and develop the country, he added.

No unsolicited tenders
The Power and Energy Ministry has informed the Board of Investments (BOI) that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) will not procure power through unsolicited tender procedures.
The Board of Investments and other institutions bring proposals on power project investors. Even though these projects had received the BOI approval, the CEB by law, cannot accept these power projects, Power and Energy Ministry Secretary Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda said, adding that it would be in violation of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act.
There has been a round of meetings in this regard and we have made our position clear to the relevant parties, he explained. Dr. Batagoda also said, the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has to abide by the existing law, which is to procure power through competitive bidding only. He also said the CEB will always have to consider the least cost option when purchasing power, for the benefit of the public.
Speaking to the Daily News, Dr. Batagoda said, the CEB has to follow the Sri Lanka Electricity Act when it comes to purchasing power from the private sector.
Mainly, according to the Electricity Act, the CEB cannot procure electricity from power projects or any such thing without a competitive tender procedure, Dr. Batagoda said.
Secondly, any power project has to be included in the long-term generation plan. This 20-year plan has to be updated every two years. In the 20-year plan, we must identify which are least cost generation plans, he explained.
We have to consider what power projects have the lowest cost and subsequently be beneficial to the country. This long term generation plan then has to be approved by the Board of CEB, then the Power and Energy Ministry and finally by the Public Utility Commission, Dr. Batagoda further explained.
He also pointed out that the CEB now gets the approval from the Committee on Economic Management headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for the long term plan as well, before sending it to the Public Utility Commission.
The CEB can procure from the private sector power providers who are included in this long term plan only, Dr. Batagoda also pointed out.
The CEB cannot procure from or issue tender for any power project which is not included in the long-term plan by law, he added.
The only exception will be if a certain power project is given by a foreign government to the government of Sri Lanka, Dr. Batagoda said.

Post-Brexit trade deal with India worth extra 2 bn to British economy
Britain will be able to increase its exports to India by more than 2 billion per year after Brexit by cutting EU red tape, a new analysis has found.
The UK currently faces significant tariffs on its trade with India because of the European Unions failure to agree a free trade deal. The deal has been held up for a decade by European Union regulations on intellectual property and data protection, with which India is refusing to comply.
But after Britain leaves the EU, the deal can go ahead because British trade negotiators regard the disputed EU rules as unnecessary.
A report by the Commonwealth, whose 52 member nations include India and the UK, says that Brexit will present a significant opportunity.
The report, titled Brexit: Opportunities for India, says that the UK and India can secure a far-reaching deal which will see the value of British exports to India rise from 4.2bn to 6.3bn, an increase of 2.1bn, or 33 per cent.
Imports from India to the UK will rise by around 1 billion, meaning the UKs balance of trade will be improved.The report says:
Given the slow pace of negotiations over [a trade deal] with the EU, Brexit provides a fresh opportunity to India to strengthen its economic relationship with the UK through an IndiaUK trade and investment agreement.It suggests that the UK will be able to show more flexibility than the EU on red tape and increase trade between the two nations as a result.

Psycho-social programmes benefit children in war-torn areas
Different psycho-social rehabilitation programmes for children have different results due to differences in resources, methodologies and objectives. But, a much more significant difference appears when comparing rehabilitated children with children who have not undergone any rehabilitation at all. This is shown by a study from the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.
"Different programmes for taking care of traumatised children have different effects. But the main difference is between putting any programme into work and doing nothing at all. "That is one conclusion Kumari Thoradeniya draws from her thesis study, in which she has compared three different psycho-social rehabilitation programmes for war-affected children in Sri Lanka.
Field studies for the thesis were undertaken in 2005, in which Kumari used interviews, questionnaires and observations to gather data.The Muditha programme, operated in a Sinhala village in the Vavuniya district, is one of the three.
This was initiated by a Buddhist monk when some children sought his protection and care. At the time of the study, there were nearly 80 children in this programme, of whom 90 percent were Tamils from the Northern Province.
The Karuna programme in the Batticaloa district of the Eastern Province, on the other hand, was started following requests by the government and non-government officials. In 2005, the programme employed 46 staff members, all of whom had prior knowledge of conducting a psycho-social rehabilitation programme, for the 300 Tamil children in their care.
Lastly, the Upeksha programme  also in the Batticaloa district  was initiated by a Catholic priest living in the same war-torn area as the community he served. The programme involved groups of 25 Tamil and 25 Muslim children, and equal numbers of boys and girls, for nine months. After nine months, another group with the same composition was selected.The programmes were also compared with a group of children who had not been subject to any rehabilitation at all.
"The impact levels of each of the programmes were different because of their differences in objectives, approaches and methodologies, as well as varying levels of human and material resources," explains Kumari.
"However, when comparing the rehabilitated children with those who had not gone through any rehabilitation, there was a remarkable difference. The rehabilitated children showed a much higher possibility of becoming normal citizens compared to those who had not undergone any rehabilitation.The results underscore the need to recognize requirements for psycho-social rehabilitation, as this is intrinsic to long-term personal as well as social development. Government policies should include psycho-social support for victims of war, and should take into account issues such as local human resources, building capacity, enhancing resilience, networking, advocacy and coordination with other actors when addressing the psycho-social well-being of a population."

Dharmaraja College gave a good display of rugby to win their second game of the season against St. Peters College beating Peterites by 35 points (2 goals, 3 tries and 2 penalties) to 24 (1 goal, 1 try and 4 penalties) in their Div. one Segment 1 A rugby match here in Kandy at Nittawela grounds yesterday. At half time winners led 27-9. This is the last first round match of the two schools.
This is the Rajans best game of the season. Earlier they beat D.S. Senanayake and went down to St. Josephs, St. Anthonys, Isipathana and Royal Colombo.
Even with this win, Rajans are to play in the Plate competition during the second round and Peteires will still compete for Cup championship, thanks to the Antonians loss at the hands of Royal, which helped Peterites to remain in the Cup competition.
Scores for Dharmaraja - Sandeepa Shiva (2 tries), Chamika Perera, Yemin Basuru, Binura Bandara (1 try each). Gihan Ishara did the conversions. For St. Peters College, Mohamed Mohideen put up two tries while Stephan Sivaraj made the conversion.
Rajans under the guidance of Kapila Silva displayed a superb show, though they failed to enter the Cup competition. They stunned Peterites, who was in fine form this season.
Rajans looked a complete different outfit by transforming themselves into a fighting outfit. They were fast on the field throughout the game. They gave a superb forward play and their tackling too was terrific which brought the Peterite attack to a grinding halt.
The game began with even exchanges and the Peterites looked very dangerous, but gradually Rajans made inroads and sealed the victory at the end.

Rehabilitation hospital to be constructed at Mankulam
A new rehabilitation hospital will be constructed at Mankulam in Vanni to rehabilitate around 45,000 disabled persons living in Vanni, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, there are around 1,600 kidney patients in Vavuniya and 60 percent of them are from the Southern part of Vavuniya. During the previous regime, people had been re-settled in Mamaduwa in Vavuniya without providing them basic facilities.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the newly constructed kidney care centre at Mamaduwa recently.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the Northern Province Health Minister made a request to develop health facilities in the area. Sri Lanka was destroyed due to racism and the war was a temporary solution. The good governance government will ensure the rights of all.
When all required facilities are provided for the disabled, they will understand the bitterness of war. The rehabilitation hospital is to be built with the support of the Northern Provincial Council. A research centre will be constructed with the assistance of the European Union (EU) to find out the reason for the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU). When the reason is revealed, it will be much easier to treat the patients, he added.

Rehabilitation of Labugama Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plants completed
Access Engineering PLC braces its presence in the water sector with the recently completed rehabilitation work of Labugama and Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plants. These time-worn water supply schemes have been accounting for 15 -18% of water requirement in Colombo City and Suburbs before rehabilitation work began.
Labuagama and Kalatuwawa Treatment plants were constructed by the British in 1886 and 1957 in close proximity to each other with a capacity of 60,000 m3/day at Labugama WTP and 90,000 m3/day at Kalatuwawa WTP which have been later reduced by 30% due to the severe deterioration that has occurred over the years.
Recognizing the vital rehabilitation work required for the said the treatment plants, National Water Supply and Drainage Board initiated a project with a tied aid loan provided by the Government of Hungary together with Access Engineering PLC and Fevarosi Vizumvek of Hungary. Design and the construction of all the non-process components of the project and civil work of process based components were primarily awarded to Access Engineering PLC under a consortium formed by Access engineering PLC and Betonutepito Zrt of Hungary while Betonutepito Zrt proposed and designed the new water treatment process and the supplied all mechanical and electrical materials.
The long awaited rehabilitation work proceeded under the three stages of design, construction and assistance in operations and maintenance. The scope of the work includes the renovation and replacement of existing filters and clarifiers, intake well improvements, modification of aerators and other process structures , design, supply and installation of all M&E equipments, reconstruction and renovation of existing buildings , internal roads and site work, etc,
With the completion of the project by 26th of February 2017, the productive capacities of the treatment plants were extended and the water quality was significantly improved.
The excess of water treated after the rehabilitation work, is now supplied to the areas situated in western -east zone of Colombo (Maharagama, Homagama, Padukka, Kaduwela, Seethawaka, Kotte, Kesbewa & Kolonnawa...etc,)
"The engineering team worked in a highly challenging environment as the rehabilitation work proceeded while the treatment plants are in operation.
Yet Access Engineering made every effort to complete the work while ensuring minimum disturbance are made to the supply of water to the city of Colombo" said Dhanushka Munasinghe, Project Manager of Rehabilitation of Labuagama & Kalatuwawa Water Treatment Plants.

Sangakkara scores 71 as Surrey open season with innings win
LONDON, Monday: Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara hit a fluent 71 in Surreys opening county match of the season against Warwickshire at the Oval.
Sangakkaras half century coupled with M Stonemans knock of 165 saw Surrey reach 454.
Warwickshire were then bowled out for 91 with M Footitt taking six wickets for 14 runs. Forced to follow-on Warwickshire were spared the blushes by England batsman Jonathan Trott as his excellent unbeaten 141 helped the Bears fight back to take their game into a fourth day closing on 322-7.
However Surrey took less than an hour on the final morning to wrap up a season-opening victory over Warwickshire by an innings and one run on Monday.
After resuming 41 behind, the Bears hopes of saving the game pretty much rested on Trott.
But Tom Curran broke through, trapping Jeetan Patel lbw - and Trott added just 10 to his score before holing out off Mark Footitt for 151.
Chris Wright was then bowled by Curran as Warwickshire were all out for 362.
Having opened up with a 23-point haul, Surreys next game is also at home against Lancashire, starting on Good Friday.

Skys 21st Century Fox  takeover cleared by Europe
European Commission competition authorities have cleared 21st Century Fox to buy the 61% of broadcaster Sky that it does not yet own.
Both Sky and Fox are controlled by businessman Rupert Murdoch, who also owns the Times and the Sun newspapers. However, the 18.5bn deal could still face regulatory obstacles in the UK, where Sky is based.
UK Culture Secretary Karen Bradley has asked regulators to investigate the deal. Last month she told MPs that Ofcom, the media watchdog, and the Competition and Markets Authority, would report to her by 16 May.
Part of Ofcom's investigation will include whether Sky's potential new owners are "fit and proper". Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan Murdoch are both joint chairmen of 21st Century Fox and News Corp, while his other son, James Murdoch, is chief executive of Fox.
Labour has raised objections to the takeover and has urged Prime Minister Theresa May to keep her promise of standing up to powerful interest groups. David Winnick, a Labour MP, said it would be "simply unacceptable that the amount of media ownership [Rupert Murdoch] already controls should be increased".
While the UK mulls possible intervention, the European Commission approved the deal "unconditionally". "Based on the results of its market investigation, the Commission concluded that the proposed transaction would raise no competition concerns," it said. Fox welcomed the Commission's decision, adding: "We now look forward to continuing to work with UK authorities and are confident that the proposed transaction will be approved following a thorough review process."
The US company is offering 11.7bn for the stake in Sky it does not already own. Sky shareholders would receive 10.75 cash for each share, valuing the entire company at 18.5bn.
Shares in Sky closed up 1p at 963p on Friday. The satellite broadcaster has 22 million customers in the UK, Ireland, Italy, Germany and Austria. In 2011, Rupert Murdoch abandoned a bid to take full control of Sky in the wake of that year's phone-hacking scandal involving journalists at his UK newspapers. One title, the News of the World, was subsequently shut down.

Some GMOA office bearers have no discipline, Rajitha
Some office bearers of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) have no any discipline. They only attempt to topple the government, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He made this observation yesterday at Temple Trees presiding over the Nursing Diploma Certificate Awarding Ceremony for the 2012 A Group. Nurses numbering 1220 obtained their diploma certificates at the ceremony.
The Minister said the trade unions of the Health Ministry like to stage strikes. They hold strikes and announce the strikes are successful, Senaratne said.
They are putting the lives of the people at stake by doing so. They should stage a strike if the discussions were failed. Some office bearers of GMOA do not like discussions, he said.
The Minister said the strike should not be the main tool that the trade unions have to win their demands.
The government attempt to solve the issues in a humanistic manner, but the trade unions act the other way round, he said.
With whatever issues they create, this government cannot be toppled, Minister Senaratne said. The government should take stern actions against the GMOA. I am always in that view. They have taken free education to become doctors but actions of some doctors cannot be acceptable, he said.
Minister said the trade unions say they would stage strikes when the Ministry said disciplinary actions against the medical staff. In the past, the strikes were held to protect the free health service, but now such strikes are not being held, Minister said. During a discussion with the GMOA, the Health Services Director General had told them that he was working in accordance with the government regulations, the minister said.
Minister Senaratne said the GMOA in response to Health Services Director General had said they would see to it when they toppled the government after three years.
We have to change the mentality of some of the office bearers of the GMOA, Minister Senaratne said.
The Good Governance Government do not take defeat as the Bandaranaike government did. The government is committed to serve the people. So nobody can topple this government, he said.

Sri Lankan real estate to be honoured at PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards 2017
The annual PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards series has been revamped in 2017 to include categories for Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Laos, India and the Maldives markets.
The Asia Property Awards grand final ceremony in Singapore will now be held over two nights at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands on November 7 and 8, 2017. The finale will also feature China, Hong Kong and Macau categories as part of the expanded programme.
In the lead up to the November ceremony, nominations are now being accepted online via AsiaPropertyAwards.com/nominations/. Developers, industry professionals, consumers and the public can nominate until August 18 and official entries are accepted until August 25.
Sri Lankan real estate, which joins the Awards series in its 12th year, recently entered JLL's Global Real Estate Transparency Index for the first time and has shown huge potential for development. The sector is supported by a stable economy with a projected 6 percent growth this year.
Country winners in Sri Lanka and other markets will advance to the seventh annual PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards grand final in Singapore to compete for regional titles and to be crowned the "best in Asia" in 2017.
Last year's grand final champion was Malaysia's Sime Darby Property, which collected the biggest award for Best Developer (South East Asia).
"The recognition of Sime Darby Property as the Best Developer in South East Asia by such esteemed industry experts is further testament of our commitment as a trusted developer. We were very honoured to receive the award and our heartfelt appreciation goes to the organiser," Dato' Ir Jauhari Hamidi, managing director at Sime Darby Property, said in a press statement in November 2016.
Every stage of the awards programme - from nominations to site visits and judges' deliberations - is strictly supervised by BDO, one of the world's largest auditing and accountancy firms with operations in more than 130 countries and territories. BDO has been the official supervisor of the Awards for more than a decade.
"It has been an exciting journey for the Asia Property Awards after joining PropertyGuru in 2016," said Terry Blackburn, founder and managing director of the Awards. "Our expanded awards scheme is a tribute to the strength of the Asian real estate industry. Fair judgement and transparency of process are at the heart of the Awards and we're delighted to introduce the awards system to Asia's rapidly growing property markets."
He added: "For more than a decade we've had incredible support from various developers, who have been instrumental in the growth of the property sector. As we explore new countries for the platform, we will ensure that the PropertyGuru Asia Property Awards truly is the region's benchmark for the finest real estate developers, developments and design in the region."
Hari V. Krishnan, CEO of PropertyGuru Group, said: "Because of the Asia Property Awards, consumers are empowered to make confident property decisions, whether they're first-time buyers, expat renters or serial investors. Property knowledge is essential in our culture at PropertyGuru. We wish the country winners the best as they advance to compete at our grand final in Singapore."
First launched in 2005 by Ensign Media in Thailand, the Awards system also holds annual black-tie gala dinner events in Cambodia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Myanmar, Malaysia and Indonesia, playing host to up to 600 C-level executives, senior industry figures and VIPs at each event.
Following the format of the country awards, Sri Lanka categories are divided into three sections: Developer, Development, and Design. All eligible nominations are rigorously and fairly judged by the panels of experts, based on the most detailed and fairest criteria:
* Developers - reputation, image and corporate social responsibility initiatives; overall track record; displays of innovation; and achievement in the past 12 months.
* Development and Design - location; value for money; unique selling points; state of completion; sales success; design concept, innovation and use of space; quality of amenities; and construction and materials used.
Five industry experts are confirmed to sit on the independent judging panel in Sri Lanka. They are: Stephanie Balendra, director, SB Realtors (Private) Limited; Dr Nirmal de Silva, director and CEO, Paramount Realty; Roshan Madawela, director and founding CEO, Research Intelligence Unit; and Steven Mayes, managing director, JLL Sri Lanka.
New regional categories to join the 2017 Awards include Best Mixed Use Development (Asia). While the award was presented in select country ceremonies last year (Singapore, Malaysia, China, Hong Kong/Macau), it will be the first time that a regional winner will be named.
Another new category is Best Universal Design Development (Asia), which is open to residential and commercial developments across the region that will be shortlisted in any category at the country awards. The project must be built environment that can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.
Overall, there will be seven Design, eight Development and two Developer categories at the grand finale ceremony, which will be preceded by an official shortlist announcement in early October.
The two gala events in Singapore will each begin with a two-hour international networking cocktail reception, followed by the opening remarks and speeches, four-course dinner, and the awards ceremony proper. The first night on 7 November focuses on Singapore categories, and the second night on 8 November features the new markets and the regional competition. Alongside the gala dinner, PropertyGuru's C-suite conference - the two-day Singapore Real Estate Summit 2017 - will be held at the same venue in the daytime.

State of emergency in Egypt after Palm Sunday bombings kill 44
EGYPT: Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced a three-month state of emergency following twin church bombings by the Islamic State group that killed dozens on Palm Sunday, the deadliest attacks on the minority in recent memory.
The attacks in the Nile Delta cities of Tanta and Alexandria followed a Cairo church bombing in December and came weeks before a planned visit by Catholic Pope Francis intended to show support for Egypts Christian minority.
Sisi declared the three-month state of emergency, which he must present to parliament within a week, during a defiant speech warning that the war against the jihadists will be long and painful.
The first bombing at the Mar Girgis church in Tanta city north of Cairo killed 27 people, the health ministry said.
Emergency services had scrambled to the scene when another blast rocked St Marks church in Alexandria where Coptic Pope Tawadros II had been leading a Palm Sunday service.
Seventeen people including at least four police officers were killed in that attack, which the interior ministry said was caused by a suicide bomber who blew himself up when prevented from entering the church.
The ministry said Tawadros was unharmed, and a church official said he left before the explosion.
The private CBC Extra channel aired footage of the Alexandria blast, with CCTV showing what appeared to be the church entrance engulfed in flame and flying concrete moments after a guard turned a man away.
Eyewitnesses said a police officer detected the bomber before he blew himself up.
At least 78 people were wounded in Tanta and 40 in Alexandria, the health ministry said.
Egyptian officials denounced the violence as an attempt to sow divisions, and Francis sent his deep condolences to Tawadros.
IS claimed two Egyptian suicide bombers carried out both attacks and threatened further attacks in a statement published on social media. After the bombings, Sisi ordered military deployments to guard vital and important infrastructure, his office said. State television reported that the interior minister sacked the provincial head of security and replaced him after the attack.
I heard the blast and came running. I found people torn up... some people, only half of their bodies remained, Nabil Nader, who lives in front of the Tanta church, said.
At St Marks in Alexandria, at night the bodies were brought in wooden coffins decorated with golden crosses to the church yard where hundreds of sad and angry Copts gathered and a priest was saying prayers.
A Muslim funeral was also held in El Behira province for one of the four policemen killed in the St Marks attack.
A general view of a Coptic church that was bombed on Sunday in Tanta, Egypt.
Worshippers had been celebrating Palm Sunday, one of the holiest days in the Christian calendar, marking Jesuss triumphant entrance to Jerusalem.
Egypt had been ruled under emergency law -- which allows police expanded powers of arrest and surveillance -- for decades before 2012. Pope Francis, who is due in Cairo on April 28-29, offered prayers for the victims. Let us pray for the victims of the attack unfortunately carried out today, he said.
May the Lord convert the heart of those who sow terror, violence and death and also the heart of those who make weapons and trade in them. Copts, who make up about one tenth of Egypts population of more than 92 million and who celebrate Easter next weekend, have been targeted by several attacks in recent months.
Jihadists and Islamists accuse Copts of supporting the military overthrow of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi in 2013, which ushered in a deadly crackdown on his supporters.
In December, a suicide bombing claimed by IS killed 29 worshippers in a Cairo church.
The group later released a video threatening Egypts Christians with more attacks. A spate of jihadist-linked attacks in the restive Sinai Peninsula, including the murder of a Copt in the city of El Arish, led some Coptic families to flee.
US President Donald Trump led international condemnation of Sundays attacks.
So sad to hear of the terrorist attack in Egypt. US strongly condemns. I have great confidence that President Al Sisi will handle situation properly, he tweeted.
UN chief Antonio Guterres expressed the hope that the perpetrators will be swiftly brought to justice after a Security Council statement condemned the bombings as heinous and cowardly.
The Cairo-based Al-Azhar, an influential Sunni Muslim authority, said the attacks aimed to destabilise security and... the unity of Egyptians. Egypts Copts have endured successive attacks since Morsis ouster in July 2013. More than 40 churches were targeted nationwide in the two weeks after the deadly dispersal by security forces of two pro-Morsi protest camps in Cairo on August 14 that year, Human Rights Watch said.

Sun directly overhead until April 15
The drop in winds and the sun being directly over Sri Lanka until April 15 are main causes for the prevailing excessive hot weather, the Meteorology Department stated.
Meteorology Department Deputy Director Anusha Warnasuriya said clouds are not seen in the morning hours during the inter-monsoon period. Therefore, sunlight falls directly on the ground aggravating the hot weather conditions.
She said thundershowers could be experienced in the evenings in April and May.
The temperature in Colombo marked as 33 degrees Celsius while Jaffna, Ratnapura, and Vavuniya were at 35 degrees Celsius yesterday.
Anuradhapura reported a temperature exceeding 36.1 degrees Celsius. The average maximum temperature in several parts of Sri Lanka increased to 35 degree Celsius.
National Hospital Coordinator Pushpa Ramya De Soysa said the prevailing heat wave may cause children and the elderly population to be dehydrated since their endurance level is low.
De Soysa said increased thirst, dry mouth, decreased urine output, headache, dry skin, nausea, and dizziness are dehydration symptoms and the public is cautioned to be vigilant on the symptoms and seek medical attention. She also instructed the public to consume a lot of fluids to prevent dehydration.

Tollywood now embraces disability
Disability is a subject that hasnt been explored widely in Tollywood. Earlier, portrayals often made disabled people seem like objects of pity, isolated beings embittered by fate. But social attitudes have changed. We now have a slew of Telugu films that have embraced inclusivity for the disabled and are normalising portrayals.
From Ravi Teja and Raj Tarun who play visually-challenged people in their upcoming films, Raja The Great and Andhagadu to Ram Charan who is rumoured to be playing a hearing impaired man in his next, or Nagarjuna who wowed as a wheel-chair bound quadriplegic millionaire in Oopiri- these actors are breaking the age-old stereotype that a hero needs to be invincible.
Filmmakers and writers too are attempting to convey these characters with some degree of sincerity and sensitivity. A disability doesnt make a person less intelligent or interesting. Ravi Tejas character is going to be a combination of both. There was a time when a disabled protagonist was seen only in art films or horror movies, but we are going completely commercial, with zero compromise on the character, shares Anil Ravipudi, director of Raja The Great, agreeing that the actors decision to take up the role was looked at as a bold move by many.
Thats probably because a stars image is at stake in such scenarios. In fact, Nagarjuna revealed that when he was approached for Oopiri, the filmmakers had doubts if hed agree at all! Reflecting on the same, music composer, actor and director R.P. Patnaik says, When I did Seenu Vasanthi Lakshmi (in which he is visually impaired), it was easy for me to transform into the character, because I am not a star whose films are watched with a set of expectations.

Turkish Airlines quickly responded to this call for action which has turned out to be one of the most powerful social responsibility campaigns of all times. In response to the demand of Jerome and his friends to carry humanitarian help to Somalia, Turkish Airlines as the only airline that connects Somalia to the world tweeted the message We had a call for a journey of love and action and announced that, they will support the campaign by carrying 200 tons of humanitarian aid to Somalia in the coming 6 months.

Two opening batsmen of class - Sunil Gavaskar and Geoffrey Boycott
As our readers already know, our disadvantage we immediately encounter is a dearth of opening batsmen. Just imagine having Sunil Gavaskar and Geoffrey Boycott coming into opening the proceedings for Sri Lanka, I am sure young Kusal Mendis will be grinning from year to year.
I feel that these two cricketing greats have the basics engraved in them and its worthwhile having a peep at their performances. From the subcontinent Gavaskar has been lavishly praised by Rajan Bala in his book Glances of Perfection. He states that the initial back and across movement he used to the express fast bowlers was only after he had assessed that at that pace they would find it almost impossible to get the ball to move off the seam, and even he reckoned if they did move it, it would be generally in. As a result of this he handled the fastest of bowlers with such skill and aplomb that they were soon a frustrated lot. Bala further adds that if he had a problem with this type of bowling, it was when the fast medium bowler maintained a consistent on and outside the off stump line and a length that did not quite permit playing off the back foot. Then he became a wee bit tentative. Even then he handled this sort of attack better than all, because the basis of his play was side on.
Bala emphasizedthat, Gavaskar like Pataudi before him, followed the maxim taught to the great England batsman, Peter May by his coach, former England bowler George Geary: keep your head still, stand still as long as you can. When you move your feet, move quickly, but the longer you stand still the later you play your shot. One should not forget the English coaching influence on Gavaskar in the form of Stan Worthington.
The unique aspect of Gavaskars batting was that he was a keen watcher and a quick learner. At the first sign of trouble with his technique he would talk to former players turned coaches, and Bala further adds that it would have helped Gavaskar, he still went back to the drawing board practicing for hours and asking his Dardar Union Club faithfuls to bowl to what he perceived as a problem area.
As it happens just a sound technique would not make a great batsman there is also the mental aspect adds Bala, an avid student of the game, Gavaskar made mental notes about every bowler he faced and about the conditions he played in. In 1974 he authored what many of us feel till this day was technically the best of his 34 centuries. This was before he sustained the finger injury. At Old Trafford in the first Test against an England attack comprising Bob Willis, Chris Old, Mike Hendrick. Tony Greig and Derek Underwood, and in conditions that were tailor made for them, extreme cold and the bowlers getting movement through the air and off the seam, he scored 101 in the first innings and 58 in the second innings. That century displayed skill in technique that have yet to be bettered by any other batsman in adverse weather conditions.
The other batsman of equal class as an opening batsman was Geoffrey Boycott, Nick Brownlee in his book The One Hundred Greatest Cricketers describes Boycott as infuriating, obstinate,opinionated- but how England could do with an opening batsman who could hang around as long as Boycott those days. At times watching Boycott at the crease was akin to pulling teeth, yet his record speaks for itself: of the 112 batsmen who have made more than 25,000 first class runs, only Don Bradman (95.14) has a better career average than Boycott (56.83), states Brownlee.
Boycott announced himself in 1965 with a brilliant century in 1965 Gillette Cup Finals, but thereon his career became clouded with controversy. He seems to be constantly at war with the management and players at Yorkshire and when passed over for the England captaincy, he made himself unavailable for Test matches from 1974 till 1977. Typically on his return to the England side, he scored his hundredth hundred in front of his adoring fans at Headingly, concludes Brownlee.
Both these batsmen had one thing in common and that was getting back to the drawing board, practicing and perfecting their art. Today there is a surfeit of cricket in all forms and on a given day practically all the test playing countries are in action. The question is how can young talent that we have hone their skills, have they got any breathing space, their calendars are choc a bloc with fixtures. Have the cricket world gone mad Dont they know that too much of a good thing is good for nothing
For some of our batsmen who are currently on display, the forward defensive shot is nonexistent, why play a forward defensive shot, their idea is to propel the ball out of the ground, knowing jolly well that the vultures are hanging around the boundary lines. They forget that Sir Vivian Richards played a defensive shot after hitting a six. One should not tempt fate too much!

United Airlines incident: Why do airlines overbook

A common overbooking problem on a United Airlines flight on Sunday ended with a man being bloodied and dragged from his seat and an already troubled airline earning more bad press. How did it all go so wrong
Overbooking on flights happens all the time. Empty seats cost airlines money, so they offset the number of passengers who miss flights by selling too many tickets.
In this case, the problem arose because United decided at the last minute to fly four members of staff to a connection point and needed to bump four passengers to make way for them.
When there's an overbooking issue the first step is to offer an inducement to the passengers to take a later flight. On Sunday passengers were offered $400 (322), a hotel room for the night, and a flight the following afternoon.
When no-one took the offer, the amount was upped to $800. Still no-one bit, so a manager boarded the flight and informed passengers that four people would be selected to leave the flight.
That selection is based on several factors, but frequent fliers and higher fare-paying passengers are given priority to stay aboard, a spokeswoman for United confirmed.
A couple who were selected agreed to leave the plane voluntarily. A third passenger, reportedly the wife of the man who was forcibly removed, also agreed. The man, who said he was a doctor and had to see patients in the morning, refused.
At this point, the airline could have identified another passenger for removal or raised its offer anywhere up to a maximum of $1,350.
Erin Benson, a spokeswoman for United, could not confirm whether other passengers were sought. She did confirm that no offer was made above $800, but could not comment on why.
According to eyewitnesses, the man who refused to be ejected said he was a doctor and he had appointments to keep the following day, though this has not been confirmed. This was a Sunday night flight; the next flight on offer didn't leave until 15:00 on Monday.
An eyewitness said the man was "very upset" about the possibility of being bumped and attempted to call his lawyer. An airline manager told him that security would be called if he did not comply.
At this point, security officers came to speak to him, first one then two more. As the video shows, their conversation ended with the man being yanked from his seat onto the floor and dragged off, blood visible on this face.
United is technically within its rights to forcibly remove the man for refusing to leave the flight, and the step is part of the airline's carriage guidelines, but such instances are extremely rare.
Of the 613 million people who flew on major US carriers in 2015, 46,000 were involuntarily denied boarding, according to data from the Department of Transportation - less than 0.008%.
The majority of those would have been informed before they boarded the flight, said Charles Leocha, the founder of passenger advocacy group Travelers United. He could not remember seeing a passenger violently dragged off a plane. "It turned my stomach," he said.
Removing passengers at the last minute to make way for staff was also highly unusual, he said. Staff transport should be identified ahead of time and factored into bookings.
US fliers have become resigned to chronic delays and poor service, according to Leocha, and a lack of readily available information about their rights meant they were too dependent on the airline managers in situations like these.
"Our expectations have been driven so low that passengers have begun to accept it," he said. "What they shouldn't have to accept is being dragged off the flight to make way for an employee."
Oscar Munoz, CEO of United, said in a statement: "This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers."
Munoz said the airline would review the event and "reach out" to the passenger, though a spokeswoman could not confirm whether United was in touch with him yet.
One of the security officers involved in the incident was suspended on Monday afternoon, pending a review, said the Chicago Department of Aviation in a statement.
The actions of the officer were "obviously not condoned by the Department", the statement said.
Whatever happened on the flight - and the details will undoubtedly emerge in the coming days - it was a bad day for United, Leocha said. The airline had only recently been at the centre of another controversy, when a fortnight ago it refused to let two girls board because they were wearing leggings.
"This isn't really a lesson for passengers it's a lesson for airlines," he said. "The only lesson here for passengers is when security get on throw up your hands, because otherwise you're going down the aisle with a fat lip."

US, Mexico, Canada join to launch 2026 World Cup bid

The United States, Mexico and Canada are joining together and will enter a bid to host the 2026 World Cup.
The announcement was made Monday afternoon in a press conference hosted by the federations of the three countries at One World Observatory in New York.
The bid also comes at a time while the current US president, Donald Trump, has implemented an aggressive stance on immigration enforcement and wants to build a wall at the US-Mexico border.
"We have the full support of the United States government in this project," United States Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati said. "The President of the United States is fully supportive and encouraged us to have this joint bid. He is especially pleased that Mexico is part of this bid -- and that's in the last few days we've gotten further encouragement on that.
"So we're not at all concerned about some of the issues that other people may raise. We looked at bidding alone and decided in the end we wanted to bid with our partners in North America, and we have a strong encouragement from President Trump to that very end."
FIFA, soccer's governing body, is expected to name the host for 2026 in May 2020, which is the final year of Trump's first presidential term.Because of US presidential term limits, Trump would not be in office in 2026.
"For the Federacin Mexicana de Ftbol, and the entire Mexican soccer family, it is a source of pride to be candidates, along with the United States and Canada, to host the FIFA World Cup in 2026," Mexican Football Federation President Decio de Maria said through a press release. "We have a unique opportunity to be the first country to host three World Cups. As such we are filled with pride and committed to make it the best ever."
The last time FIFA chose hosts for men's World Cups the decision was mired in controversy. In December 2010, the governing body announced that Russia and Qatar, respectively, will host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. But in the years following, FIFA has had to investigate claims that bribery influenced the voting process.
North America last held a men's World Cup in 1994, when it was hosted by the US. The US also hosted women's World Cups in 2003 and 1999, while Mexico has hosted men's World Cups in 1986 and 1970, and Canada had the women's World Cup in 2015.
"I really thank Sunil's open mindedness and U.S. Soccer's open mindedness and Mexico's open mindedness," Canadian Soccer Association President Victor Montagliani said. "I think it's a testament to I think also how football has changed in our region."
The only other time multiple nations have hosted the World Cup was in 2002, when it was held in South Korea and Japan.
In January, FIFA announced it would expand the World Cup from32 to 48teams starting in 2026.

What Trump calls strength, China calls stupidity
In China, political events proceed with clockwork choreography, especially state visits. So President Donald Trumps decision to attack the Assad regime while in the middle of his summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping came as a shock  the equivalent of holding a fancy dinner party for your boss and getting into a yelling match with a neighbour in the middle of it.
And as so often with the Trump administration, theres a smorgasbord of bad motivations to pick from. Its easy to imagine the murine sniggers of anti-Asian racist Stephen Bannon  still skittering around Trumps entourage despite his recent removal from the National Security Council  at the prospect of slapping the Chinese down, or that Trump himself thought it would be the best way to seem like a big man in front of his guest.
Several U.S. commentators have been impressed by the strength demonstrated by the strikes in Syria  and the implicit messaging that, hey, we might just get a little crazy with North Korea next. But I doubt thats how Beijing reads things. China is perfectly well aware of the military might and global reach of the United States; its not like they cant count aircraft carriers. What its continually and pleasantly surprised by is how stupidly the United States uses that strength.
For Xi, the strikes might have been a sign of disrespect  but they were also a reminder of the fundamental dumbness, from a Chinese strategic perspective, of U.S. foreign-policy decisions.
South China Sea
Sure, Syria is friendly with China  though more by transitive properties, of being a Russian client state at a time when Moscow is Beijings most consistent ally, than by any real ties. But its not an important market or a vital friend; its a distant, small country embroiled in a war far removed from China. (Syrias 22 million people are a little less than the official population of Beijing.) Chinese citizens are just as moved by the murder of innocents as anyone else, when they know about it, but theyre not going to protest in the street about it, so the government doesnt care.
Beijing likes to throw around the term core interests. Sometimes this is just rhetorical bullying, as when the term was redefined to include every inch of the South China Sea. But its also a reminder of Beijings steady, relentless focus on its key issues, both at home or abroad: Communist Party dominance, economic development, and territorial integrity. Taiwan matters, Syria doesnt. The overshadowing of Xi by Syria on foreign news probably stung a little, especially for Chinas weak, beleaguered Foreign Ministry, ever eager to prove to its bosses how much shine its putting on their image abroad. But on Chinas domestic channels  the ones that really matter to the leaders  it was all Xi, all the time. The presidential glad-handing in Mar-a-Lago led the news broadcasts, not the Syria strikes.
Trump might have thought he was signaling a bold willingness to use force to his visitor, but China regards U.S. military might as early U.S. statesman Elbridge Gerry once did the prospect of standing army: Like a standing member; an excellent assurance of domestic tranquillity, but a dangerous temptation to foreign adventure. Chinas happy to gradually extend power elsewhere, especially in its own neighborhood.
But it hasnt gone to war for 38 years, since the last spasms of the Maoist era produced a blundering invasion of Vietnam in 1979. (In that time frame, the United States has gone to war in well over a dozen countries, and Russia in close to a dozen.) Beijing views Washingtons scatter-shot, flip-flop approach to foreign policy  especially in the post-Cold War era  as destabilizing, foolish  and useful.
Iraq, any Chinese decision maker will tell you, bought us a decade. Before 9/11, it looked as though the United States was moving to seriously contain China. Afterward, the Asia-Pacific languished as American lives and money bled out in Fallujah and Kandahar.
Rights of sovereign states
While the United States was mired in the Middle East and Afghanistan, China was building factories, economic alliances, and artificial islands. As much as the Chinese publicly decry U.S. strategists suspicions about Chinas rise to the forefront of the global stage, in private they see these concerns as both logical and inevitable  hence the popularity among Chinese international relations theorists of the Thucydides Trap, the idea that an emerging power will always clash with the existing hegemon. The United States went into Iraq for no good reason, spent a trillion dollars, and came out with nothing. From the Chinese perspective, theyd just started a chess game when their opponent spotted them a queen.
China will lightly beat the drum about the rights of sovereign states and Western interference  not least to do its duty by its actual ally and neighbour, Russia. It already used one of its relatively rare U.N. Security Council vetoes to block past sanctions on Syria as a signal of good faith to Russia, although it usually relies on Moscow to take the heat and abstains. But a United States that sticks its hand in the bear trap of Syria is a United States with fewer resources to devote to areas and issues that actually matter to China.
