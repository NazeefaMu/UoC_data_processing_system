Three teams in Paris onslaught as police hunt for suspects
FRANCE: French Police have identified three teams of gunmen wearing suicide vests who killed at least 129 people during an onslaught on the French capital claimed by the Islamic State group, prosecutors said Saturday.
A 29-year-old Frenchman was the first to be confirmed among the seven attackers, all of whom died in the assault, while two other men who registered as refugees in Greece have been linked to the atrocities.
The Greek line of enquiry, and the discovery of at least one Syrian passport at the scene, has raised suspicions some of the attackers or accomplices might have entered Europe as part of an influx of people fleeing Syrias civil war.
A Syrian passport in the name of a person born in Syria in September 1990 was found near a suicide bomber who blew himself up at the Stade de France (stadium), prosecutor Francois Molins told a press conference.
Earlier in the day, the Islamic State extremist group claimed responsibility for the attacks that left a trail of destruction at a sold-out concert hall, at restaurants and bars, and outside Frances national stadium.
A total of 129 people were killed and 352 wounded, of whom 99 were said to be in critical condition. The toll does not include the seven attackers.
President Francois Hollande called the coordinated assault on Friday night an act of war as the Paris capitals normally bustling streets fell eerily quiet, 10 months after attacks on magazine Charlie Hebdo shocked the nation.
A national emergency and three days of mourning have been declared. Paris City Hall ordered all city facilities closed, while the Eiffel Tower shut indefinitely.
Amid the fear there was also defiance, as hundreds gathered spontaneously at blood donation centres and flocked to place candles and flowers at the sites where people had died only hours earlier.
In a cafe in central Paris, a man who gave his name as Luc, aged 46, said he was stunned.
I just dont understand. They keep telling us that theyve thwarted attacks, that theyve made arrests, and here youve got guys shooting at everyone in a concert hall in the centre of Paris.
Theyre unable to protect this city, thats what its about.
Gunman identified
The remains of the 29-year-old French gunman were found near the Bataclan concert hall in eastern Paris, the bloodiest of the attacks.
A total of 89 people were killed there by armed men who burst in shouting Allahu akbar (God is greatest!) before gunning down concert-goers and executing hostages.
The jihadists were heard raging at the French president and his decision in September to begin air strikes on Islamic State in Syria.
I clearly heard them say Its the fault of Hollande, its the fault of your president, he should not have intervened in Syria, Pierre Janaszak, a radio presenter who was at the concert, told AFP.
The band on stage at the time, US rock group Eagles of Death Metal, survived the attack but have cut short their European tour to return to the United States, promoters said.
As heavily-armed police stormed the Bataclan at around 12:30 am (2330 GMT), two of the gunmen blew themselves up, while the third was shot by police.
Three suicide bombers also detonated their explosives outside the Stade de France stadium where France were playing Germany in a football friendly attended by Hollande, who was evacuated.
The seventh attacker blew himself up on a bustling avenue near the Bataclan concert hall, injuring one other person.
Analysts at Eurasia Group said the attacks confirm a structural shift in the modus operandi of the Islamic State, and represent a prelude to additional attacks in the West.
European investigation
The investigation quickly spread beyond France on Saturday as Belgian police arrested several suspects in Brussels, including one who was in Paris at the time of the carnage.
Michel told Belgian television that the arrests were linked to suspect vehicles identified during the investigation by French police.
French authorities also asked their Greek counterparts for information on the passport found at the scene of the Stade de France attack.
We confirm that the (Syrian) passport holder came through the Greek island of Leros on October 3 where he was registered under EU rules, said a statement issued by Greek minister for citizen protection, Nikos Toskas.
Another foreigner sought in connection with the attacks was also found to have registered in Greece, police sources confirmed to AFP.
Greece is the main entry point in Europe for hundreds of thousands of Syrians refugees and European security forces have long feared that IS militants could hide among them.
In Germany, the authorities said they were looking into a possible link between the attacks and the arrest in Bavaria last week of a man with a car-load of weapons and explosives.
The Paris attacks were prepared, organised and planned overseas, with help from inside (France), Hollande said.
International solidarity
The massacres sparked an outpouring of emotion around the world, with Londons Tower Bridge, Berlins Brandenburg Gate and the World Trade Center in New York all illuminated in the red, white and blue of the French tricolore.
Mourners also broke out in spontaneous renditions of the French anthem La Marseillaise, including at a rally in Dublin and at New Yorks Metropolitan Opera.
US President Barack Obama described the onslaught as an attack on all of humanity and an emotional Pope Francis said he was shaken by the inhuman attacks.
British Prime Minister David Cameron said the attacks suggest a new degree of planning and coordination and a greater ambition for mass casualty attacks.
France has been on high alert following the January attacks and narrowly averted more bloodshed in August when a gunman was overpowered on a packed high-speed train coming from Amsterdam.
In their statement posted online Saturday, IS said eight brothers wearing explosive belts and carrying assault rifles conducted a blessed attack on... Crusader France, saying the targets were carefully chosen.
It also referred to French air strikes on IS in Syria, threatening further attacks as long as it continues its Crusader campaign.
As well as the stadium and the concert hall, several restaurants were also targeted, including a popular Cambodian eatery in the trendy Canal St. Martin area, where at least 12 people died. Another 19 people were killed at a busy restaurant on nearby Rue de Charonne.

Soma Edirisinghe:
You will continue to live in our hearts forever
Kissing her forehead a few weeks ago, I whispered, "I love you, archcha". Then I left the hospital bed she was laying in after she whispered "bye darling".
Little did I know, this would be our last goodbye. It breaks my heart to know she's gone, and I find myself secretly shedding tears when I am reminded of her. But more than anything, I am hopeful. Let me tell you why.
What can I possibly say about Sri Lanka's sweetheart that hasn't already been said Most people know her as a phenomenal businesswoman and philanthropist who wholeheartedly served the people of Sri Lanka.
They call her Deshabandu, they call her Deshashakthi, and they even call her Doctor. But there are only 12 individuals including myself who have the privilege of calling her "archchi".
While the media constantly reminds us of her superhuman efforts in the fields of business and philanthropy, to me, she was simply "archchi", the only grandparent I had the privilege of meeting.
I wouldn't be lying if I said that my siblings, cousins, and I sometimes had to make "unofficial" appointments to meet her; but when we did, we ended up having the best of times.
She certainly wasn't a conventional grandmother. I mean, how many grandmothers would ask their grandchildren to read her autobiography when they ask her to recite a story of her childhood
Soma Edirisinghe would never do such a thing, but my archchi did. She spoiled us with the best birthday presents and her beautiful spacious garden was the venue to all our parties. She was witty, loving, and caring in her own unique way, and we loved her immensely.
My archchi lived an amazing life. And when she wasn't busy serving the people of Sri Lanka, she would take the time teach me a lesson or two.
She instilled in me the notion that the effort you put in is what you get out. There is no dream too big to achieve, no task too difficult to accomplish, and no challenge too daunting to overcome.
Life is what it is. She warned me that I would encounter setbacks. But more importantly, she made me promise that when I do, I will accept them, learn from them and push on.
Success requires toil and perseverance, as does any great goal worth struggling for - my grandmother is a testament to this. But most importantly, archchi taught us the importance of serving and appreciating those around you, and in doing so she inspired us to be the best that we can be. And that is exactly what we will do.
My siblings, cousins, and I certainly have big shoes to fill, but with you watching over us, we know that the sky is the limit. And while I wish I get to say "I love you, archcha" one more time and see your smiling face, I find peace in knowing that you are right there beside me saying "don't worry darling, I know".
You may have left us now, but you will continue to live in our hearts forever.
I love you Archcha!

M.A. Nawaz:
A dedicated social worker
The janaza of Alhaj Mohamed Arif Nawaz, a senior Vice-President of the Moors' Islamic Cultural Home, took place at the Kuppiyawatte Muslim burial grounds, Colombo on November 11, 2015) amidst a large and distinguished crowd.
He was 79 years and leaves his wife and three children - two boys and one girl.
A dedicated social worker and Islamic activities, Nawaz was deeply involved in the social uplift and religious activities of the MICH.
He took a keen interest in the welfare of the old and other destitute housed at the Makola Home for the Aged.
In fact, just two days before his death he had visited the Makola Home with Chairman M. Mohideen Rajabdeen and had attended to the wants and requirements of the inmates.
He throughout his life, showed an abiding interest regarding problems faced by the Muslim community, and involved himself in solving them through the Home.
He also helped the MICH in attaining international standard in billiards and snooker, and was the manager when M.J.M. Lafir won the World Billiards Championship - the first Sri Lankan to crown himself as a World Champion in any sport - in Bombay in 1973.
As one who was keenly interested in building up a strong media, he was closely associated with some of the well-known journalists at that time and backed to the hilt the launching of AL-ISLAM tabloid edited by journalist Hamza Haniffa of Lake House fame.
While conveying my deepest condolences to his wife and family members and the MICH President Omar Kamil and members of the Home, I say my fervent Du'a is for the good soul of M.A. Nawaz to enter the eternal sanctuary of the Jennathul Firdous!

P.K.S.Mohideen:
A man with extremely good qualities
Born on May 26, 955 , basic education in your native place, then in Madras (now Chennai) you worked for an industrialist in Bombay (now Mumbai) married me and settled in Sri Lanka as a successful businessman till your last breath.
We married on September 1, 1985. As my father was a strong Indian he was adamant in giving his daughters in marriage to Indians, so this is how my life with you started.
You were not a most important person nor a very important person, but a very very simple ordinary man dressed in a white cotton half sleeved shirt.
Wherever you went, whatever function it may be, you were easily spotted in your white shirt.
Life with you was just wonderful, words are not enough to pen. You were a very down to earth person with good qualities. You had the talent to handle everything single handed and you helped uplift many families.
The relationship you had with your staff and customers was great.
You will be magnified and multiplied in the creator's rank. Your dedication and devotion in your business took you to the top most level.
I had a very good happy and contented life with you from 1985-2014. Only a child was missing in our married life but that in your version "Having a child is not a profit and not having a child is not a loss".
I finally followed you quiet happily what the creator 'destined' for us. Life without you is boring, dark and lonely.
You were my inspiration in giving charity. You are not a personality to be forgotten.
Your memories are like pressed flowers in my thought. My prayers and duas for you to be my husband even in Jannah (paradise).
F.B.Mohideen.
N.C. Peiris :
You were mother and father to us
It's hard, very hard to pen all that you are to me and my family. You were both mother and father to us. The many times I miss you I feel you are right near me. You are a memory that will never fade.
As I returned to the land you loved, the land of the Menorah, to me, you were here. The words you spoke resounded within me, a gong that will not be silenced with time. Time stood still, as I heard your voice, the things you said just flooded my mind. I thought time will heal, I guess that it is just a phrase.
No one can ever replace you. Your love and faithfulness to God and family is fast fading in the modern world of selfishness and injustice.
I am blessed to have had a father - so selfless and kind. You were always there for me, you understood me.
The things you spoke are etched within me- an Eternal Monument portraying Faithfulness to Yahweh.
Dada, until we meet again in the sweet bye and bye, I pray I will be faithful to El Shaddhai as you were. ". For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable,
Then will come to pass the saying,
"O death, where is your victory O death, where is your sting" (1 Corinthians 15:55)

Because pregnancy is a shared responsibility
Hemas Hospital in Wattala hosted a celebration on November 11 to commemorate 10,000 successful baby deliveries at the hospital chain, coupled with a promotion of their special Maathru package of perks for new mothers.
Maathru is a very impressive financial leg-up for women with newborns. It includes the entire baby- delivery process at a fixed price (at rates between Rs. 40,000 and Rs. 85,000), including the labor room, medicines, doctors fee and use of the pharmacy, laboratories, ICU and other hospital units.
It also includes a savings account partnered with HNB with a Rs. 1500 opening balance, gift packs of diapers, baby toiletries, infant clothes and bottles from Baby Cheramy, Farlin and other brands, a 10% discount worth over Rs. 10,000 for essential vaccinations for the baby up to 10 years of age, 10% off Farlin flagship stores, 10% off for online purchases from Happiness.lk and free antenatal classes at the hospital.
The benefits provided are clearly manifold and seem an attempt by the institution to make the patients daunting transition into caretaker a smooth one.
Speaking on the occasion at Hemas Hospital, Director of the Private Health Sector Regulatory Council, Dr Kanthi Ariyaratne, stated that a pregnancy is not one persons responsibility, but in fact a shared responsibility, between family members, and between the hospital staff and the family.
She went on to say that knowledge and the right attitude were integral to how well patients were treated at Hemas, and that more valuable than the commendable high-tech facilities they have, is the human touch - the relationship between two humans - that truly defines the experience that a patient has at a hospital.
Countless new mothers and infants filled the lobby of Hemas Hospital at the event, ushering in a new era of their lives, and grateful for the support that Maathru gives them at the beginning of it. The hospitals move to celebrate the mothers and their children, even years after birth, marks its endeavor to form lasting bonds with its patients.
Hemas Hospital prides itself on being accredited by the Australian Council of Healthcare Standards, and reaches to do more than just treat patients as patients, but as life-time customers. The Maathru package just enhances the parents experience and is our way of thanking them for choosing to have their babies at our hospitals, stated Dr Peiris of Hemas staff.

Car used in attacks found in Paris suburb
A black Seat Leon car used by gunmen who fired at people in restaurants during the attacks in Paris on Friday has been found in the eastern suburb of Montreuil, police said today.
French Police had identified one of the gunmen who blew himself up at the Bataclan concert hall, himself up at the scene of the bloodiest attack where 89 people were killed, as 29-year-old Paris native Omar Ismail Mostefai.
Six people close to Mostefai have been detained, including his father, brother and sister-in-law, judicial and police sources said.
The Islamic State group has claimed the carnage carried at some of the French capital's most popular night-spots, including a sold-out concert hall, at restaurants and bars and outside France's national stadium. The seven attackers -- six blew themselves up and one was shot by police -- are the first to ever carry out suicide bombings on French soil and, unlike those who killed 17 in Paris in January, were unknown to security services.
Investigators in France, Belgium, Greece and Germany are now trying to find out who these men were, how they carried out such a vast coordinated attack, and why. Meanwhile, Belgian police have arrested several people over links to the Paris attacks in a huge sweep, including one who was in the French capital at the time of the attacks.
Justice Minister Koen Geens said the arrests were in connection with a grey Polo that had been rented in Belgium that was found near the Bataclan concert hall.- NDTV

Climate change and warming seas make sharks smaller and weaker
AUSTRALIA: Sharks could be smaller and weaker in the future because of climate change.
A University of Adelaide study of Port Jackson sharks in captivity reveals warmer water and higher carbon dioxide levels associated with climate change make them hungrier but reduce their metabolic efficiency, leave them unable to smell for food and stunt their growth.
"In warmer water, sharks are hungrier but with increased CO2, they won't be able to find their food," study leader associate professor Ivan Nagelkerken said.
"With a reduced ability to hunt, sharks will no longer be able to exert the same top-down control over the marine food webs, which is essential for maintaining healthy ocean ecosystems."
The Port Jackson shark is a bottom-feeding shark that relies primarily on its sense of smell for food.
In the university study they took much longer to find food or didn't bother trying with a higher concentration of CO2 in the water.
Dr Nagelkerken said all shark species were likely to suffer similarly under climate change.
University of Adelaide marine ecologist Professor Sean Connell said the study threw extra weight behind a push to prevent the overfishing of sharks.
"One-third of shark and ray species are already threatened worldwide because of overfishing," he said.
"Climate change and ocean acidification are going to add another layer of stress and accelerate those extension rates." - AAP

Clinton urges war on Islamic State, not Muslims
US: White House hopeful Hillary Clinton called for global unity to crush the Islamic State group, as the carnage in Paris took center stage at Saturday's Democratic presidential debate.
The three candidates began their debate with a moment of silence for the victims in France, bringing Friday's horrific attacks an ocean away to the forefront of the 2016 race as they dominated the first half hour of the political showdown.
Clinton, liberal US Senator Bernie Sanders and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley united in calling for the destruction of the jihadists accused of massacring at least 129 people in the French capital.
"We are not at war with Islam," said the former secretary of state, choosing her words with care as she warned ordinary Muslims should not be viewed as a threat. "We are at war with violent extremism."
"Our prayers are with the people of France tonight, but that is not enough," she said, calling for global resolve to defeat ISIS, "a barbaric, ruthless, violent jihadist terrorist group."
The Islamic State group (ISIS or IS) claimed responsibility for the coordinated attacks on a Paris concert hall, restaurants and bars, and outside France's national stadium -- calling it retribution for French air strikes in Syria.
"It cannot be contained, it must be defeated," Clinton said of the group which has overrun swathes of Syria and Iraq.
With all the talk of battling the jihadist wave, the Democrats on stage refused to use the term "radical Islam," which moderators used Saturday -- and Republicans in the presidential race have used throughout the campaign -- to describe the scourge.
"Let's not fall into the trap of thinking our Muslim-American neighbors... are the enemy," O'Malley said.
Former Florida governor and Republican presidential hopeful Jeb Bush spoke up from afar during the debate, tweeting: "Yes, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism."
While Democrats displayed equal determination to eradicate jihadism, fissures appeared between the candidates on whether the United States should lead the struggle.
Clinton said American leadership was critical in the effort, with all the diplomatic tools at Washington's disposal beyond just military might, "but this cannot be an American fight."
That drew a sharp disagreement from O'Malley.
"This actually is America's fight," he insisted. "America is best when we are actually standing up to evil in this world."
Relatively hawkish Clinton, self-described democratic socialist Sanders and low-polling O'Malley took the stage in Des Moines, Iowa for their second Democratic showdown in the 2016 primary cycle.
With 79 days before the first state-wide vote in Iowa, frontrunner Clinton has reinforced her status as the woman to beat in the race.
Her poll numbers have risen steadily since mid September, to more than 54 percent today according to a RealClearPolitics average. Sanders is at 33 percent, while O'Malley is languishing at three percent.
With Sanders eager to take the fight to Clinton on the economy -- he is calling for an economic revolution, while knocking Clinton for her ties to Wall Street -- the refocus on terrorism shifted the early portion of the debate in favor of the former top diplomat, fluent in foreign policy.
But Sanders stood his ground, arguing that the Iraq war, which then-senator Clinton voted to authorize in 2002, laid the foundation for the surging jihadist threat that once more sowed carnage on Friday.
"I would argue that the disastrous invasion of Iraq, something that I strongly opposed, has unraveled the region completely and led to the rise of Al-Qaeda and to ISIS," Sanders said.
The Iraq war, he repeated, "was one of the worst foreign policy blunders in the modern history of the United States."
On the economic front, the candidates sparred -- gently, compared with their Republican rivals who have already clashed in four on-stage debates -- over how to increase wages and expand the work force.
Clinton also said Saturday she had a "very aggressive plan" to rein in Wall Street's big banks.
Sanders shot back with a blunt message -- "Not good enough" -- and essentially challenged Clinton to disavow much of her connections to Wall Street millionaires who back her campaign. - AFP

## Title: Do you suffer from nail fungus

[HEALTH WATCH]
Do you suffer from nail fungus
Nail fungus is a common condition that begins as a white or yellow spot under the tip of your fingernail or more often in toenail As the fungal infection goes deeper, nail fungus may cause your nail to get discolored, thickened and crumbled at the edge. It can affect several nails, but usually not all of them.
If your condition is mild and does not bother you, you may not need treatment. If your nail fungus is painful and has caused thickened nails, self-care steps and medications may help. But even if treatment is successful, nail fungus often comes back.
Nail fungus is also called onychomycosis (on-ih-koh-my-KOH-sis) or tinea unguium. When fungus infects the areas between your toes and the skin of your feet, it's called athlete's foot or tinea pedis.
Characteristics of infection due to onychomycosis are as follows:
* Thickened nails
* Brittle, crumbly or ragged nails
* Nail shape distorted
* Nails dull in color with no shine
* As time passes nails get dark due to debris building up under your nail
Infected nails also may get separated from the nail bed -- a condition called onycholysis (on-ih-KOL-ih-sis). You may feel pain in your toes or fingertips and detect a slightly foul odor.
Nail fungal infections are typically caused by a dermatophyte fungus. Yeasts and molds also can be responsible for nail fungal infections.
Fungi are microscopic organisms that do not need sunlight to survive. Some fungi have beneficial uses. Others cause illness and infection.
Fungi:
DementiaLive in warm, moist environments, including swimming pools
* Can invade your skin through tiny cuts that cannot be seen with unaided eyes sometimes visible small opening between your nail and nail bed
* Can cause problems, if your nails are often exposed to warm and moist conditions
Your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug. Some studies show the most effective drugs are terbinafine (Lamisil) , itraconazole (Sporanox) and candazole. These drugs help a new nail growth without infection, slowly replacing the infected part.
You typically take this type of drug for six to 12 weeks. But you will not see the end result of the treatment until the nail grows back completely. It may take four months or longer to eliminate an infection.
Treatment success rates with these drugs appear to be lower in adults over age 65. And treatment success seems to improve when you combine oral and topical antifungal therapies.
Oral antifungal drugs may cause side effects ranging from skin rash to liver damage. You may need occasional blood tests to check on how you are doing with these types of drugs. Doctors may not recommend them for people with liver disease or congestive heart failure or those taking certain medications.
Trim and thin the nails. This helps reduce pain by reducing pressure on the nails. Also, if you do this before applying an antifungal, the drug can reach deeper layers of the nail.
Before trimming or using a nail file to thin the thickened nails, soften them. You can do this with the following nightly routine: Apply urea cream to affected nails, cover them with a bandage, and wash off the urea with soap and water in the morning. Repeat until the nails soften. Protect the skin around your nails with petroleum jelly
If you have a condition that causes poor blood flow to your feet and you cannot trim your nails, see a health care provider regularly to have your nails trimmed.
There are some remedies to get rid of the nail fungus at home.
Mix equal parts of apple cider vinegar or common vinegar and water, soak your toe nail in it for 30 minutes, dry your toe nails thoroughly and do this daily for a week. Another treatment is-mix a few drops of garlic extract with one tea spoon of olive oil and turmeric powder, apply it on the infected toe for 10 minutes and gently scrub it.

[COURTESY CORNER]
Dont stuff your face, dine with grace!
Table manners play an important part in making a favourable impression. They are visible signals of the state of our manners and therefore are essential to professional success. The point of etiquette rules is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable.
Whether dining with royalty, heads of state, the diplomatic corps or sitting with friends and family at a humble home repast, an understanding of dining protocol makes time spent with others around a table more enjoyable. When you know the rules there is no awkwardness or questions about how things should be done.
Instead there is only opportunity to spend quality time with the company present. I have often noticed that many of the so-called elite, or people regarded as the cream of society had never been taught proper dining etiquette. I was actually astounded that people who had spent fortunes on their education were still eating from their plates like horses.
Yes, some of us do have horrendously poor table manners. We slurp our soup, chomp our chocolate cake, spill our salt and belch our blessings. And while all of this slurping, chomping, spilling and belching can be seen as quaintly charming, we are no longer living in caves or little wooden shacks.
You must learn about basic table manners you should use at every meal.
Sure, we Sri Lankan buth gottas relish out staple rice and curry above most other menus. For us sub-continentals there is no way around it. Our food tastes best when eaten with the fingers. There is a perceptible dimension added to the eating process when we do it the customary way. Besides, Sri Lankan foods are designed to be eaten by hand.
Even breads are to be torn and wrapped around foods. Rice is customarily blended with curries so each mouthful is unique. If you eat off a banana leaf trying to use a knife and fork would shred your plate.
Eating gracefully with your fingers is a cultural practice everyone should experience while visiting Sri Lanka. For those who might feel finicky many Sri Lankan hosts provide esoteric table items such as fingerbowls. Frankly, many Westerners almost never use those things, and even when they do, will not know how to use them either. I remember once at a large formal rice and curry luncheon where finger bowls had been placed for every diner. One of the foreign guests tried to drink it mistaking it for a kind of exotic aperitif.
If nothing else, live by these simple rules which I was tutored in when I was around six. First always pay attention to your hosts. Being an observant diner and picking up on cues from your host will enable you to avoid most of the embarrassing situations you could find yourself in.
Simple things like waiting to eat until you see others eating and using the utensils others are using will enable you to wing it, meaning to do it in an impromptu manner, improvising, with little preparation. However, this constant observing and following does not allow you to relax and enjoy the evening. So you had better become a fast learner from simple observation so that you can dine with the confidence and finesse of an aristocrat.
To start, your napkin should be spread out on your lap, never tucked into the neck of your shirt even if you want to protect your Gianni Versace tie. Sit up straight and make sure your elbows are not encroaching on your neighbours space. Do not rest your elbows on the table or lean on them when eating. If you are served a meal that is already on the plate, wait until everyone round the table has been served before starting. When group dining, offer side dishes around the table and hold them for the person next to you.
Cutlery should be rested on the plate or bowl between bites. Never gesture with your cutlery, and do not scrape or clatter it noisily. Depending on the formality of the occasion, there will be varying amounts of cutlery on the table. The layout should always be the same, fork to the left, knives and spoons to the right. Work from the outside inwards, course by course. Dessert utensils usually sit above the place setting.
Always eat at a relaxed pace and try to match your fellow diners. Keep your mouth closed and chewing noise to a minimum. Never smack your chops. Talking while there is food in your mouth should be avoided at all costs even when you have a conversational gem ready to pop out of your gullet. Do not drink your wine too fast or ask for a top-up unless you are in very familiar company. Do not overindulge, there is nothing worse than a drunken diner, particularly at a formal or business dinner.
In order to recover if expected to speak, only put a single bite in your mouth at a time. The days of stuffing your mouth and with as much food as it can hold and wolfing it down are over.
Bring your food to your face, not your face to your food. You should not be leaning over your food, shovelling it into your mouth with a distance travelled of only six inches. Instead, sit straight, balance a single bite on the utensil of choice and bring it directly to your mouth. And never drink from your soup bowl. Say Thank You, Please, and Excuse Me. These small words are magic and should be used liberally.
Dress appropriately even for informal dining and make certain your attire even though relaxed and casual is clean.
In both social and professional circles, demonstrating class and courtesy can open doors for you, while displaying poor manners can cause doors to shut in your face.
It only takes a bit of guidance and practice to help people sail through a wide variety of potentially awkward situations while dining with grace and poise. Moving from being clueless in such matters and becoming a class act is not a impossibility if you simply follow the right guidelines.

England end series drought with Kiwi win
WIGAN, SATURDAY: Elliott Whitehead scored two tries as England survived a New Zealand fightback to beat the Kiwis 20-14 in the third and final Test in Wigan on Saturday for a 2-1 series win.
Victory gave England their first series success since 2007 when the then Great Britain, as they were known at the time, beat New Zealand 3-0.
Whitehead  who will join Australian NRL side the Canberra Raiders next season - had never before crossed for a try in international rugby but scored one in each half at a rainswept DW Stadium, the home of English north-west rugby league giants Wigan.
Jason Nightingales superb finish on the stroke of half-time kept the Kiwis in the game but when England skipper Sean OLoughlin crossed late on it seemed a home win was assured.
But not for nothing are New Zealand the number one side in the world and late tries from Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Jordan Kahu set up a dramatic finish.
The visitors fightback, allied to narrow defeats by the Kiwis in both the 2013 World Cup semi-final and the 2014 Four Nations, shredded the nerves of England fans but their side held out.
Steve McNamara knew his reign as England head coach would likely be decided on the 80 minutes of this match. Having sprung into life in the first Test in Hull to seal a comfortable 26-12 win, England had crumbled at Londons Olympic Stadium as the Kiwis levelled the series with a 9-2 victory last weekend.
And for the the decider, McNamara opted to roll the dice with his selection as Jermaine McGillvary came in on the right wing and Matty Smith at half-back on his home ground.
Much like the start of the second Test, England took the points when they were on offer early on as Gareth Widdop rewarded some early pressure with a penalty.
The Kiwis took the opposite approach on their first foray deep into English territory, opting to tap and go but the English defence held firm.
Smith class
Despite the wet conditions, both sides showed admirable ambition with ball in hand and, after the Kiwis had a scored ruled out on the 20-minute mark, it was England who grabbed the games first try.
The recalled Smith - playing his first game for England in over a year - had already shown touches of class in his kicking game when he laid a perfect grubber on for Whitehead to collect and dive over the line. Widdops conversion made it 8-0 and the Kiwis badly needed the next score before the interval to give them a foothold.
And it was Nightingale who provided it, the Kiwi winger going airborne in the left corner to evade the scrambling Zak Hardaker and acrobatically ground the ball.
Isaac Luke curled the conversion over and England reached half-time with only a two-point lead at 8-6. As the weather worsened after the break, the Kiwis dominated territory but were unable to pierce Englands defence.
And just after the hour mark Whitehead made them pay, the forward stepping past Kahu and fending off Kevin Proctor for a fine close-range score.

Bunka awards 2015
From the Land of the rising Sun....
Both Japan and Sri Lanka have emerged from the depths of despair and share a common understanding of the bitterness and the senselessness of war. For Japan the one event that almost crippled it, was the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombings. For Sri Lanka it was the war against the LTTE that claimed the lives of countless youth. But they have also a shared interest in arts and culture. So it is these similarities and experiences that have enabled them to sympathize with each other, understand each other and recognize each other strengths.
The Bunka Awards are presented annually by the Japan Sri Lanka Friendship Cultural Fund which was established in 1993, on the initiative of the Japanese Solidarity Association and the Japanese Commerce and Industry Association in Sri Lanka, in collaboration with the Embassy of Japan. The Bunka Awards are aimed at encouraging and promoting Sri Lankan artists with artistic talents in such fields as drama, theatre, dance, music, painting, sculpture, pottery, photography, lyric writing, literature, video animation and visual arts. For the past twenty one years, 118 mid-career individuals and organizations received Bunka Awards for their creative activities in culture and arts.
Japan and Sri Lanka have had a very good relationship for many years in the field of Arts and Culture which brings about true understanding. I would like to congratulate all the Bunka Award winners. This is an encouragement for all in the field of Arts and Culture in Sri Lanka. We hope this will be a bridge between Japan and Sri Lanka in the field of Arts and Culture, Ambassador of Japan, Kenichi Suganuma.
This year the following six Sri Lankan artistes received the prestigious Bunka (Cultural) Awards.
* Dileeka Abeysekara (Music/Vocal)
* Nadeeka Guruge (Music/Composer)
* Dr. Saumya Liyanage (Drama/Acting)
* Kapila Poogalaarachchige (Music)
* Lakshmi Sriharan Dance (Bharatha Natyam)
* Academic Players (Kelaniya University) Drama/Theatre
During the long years of association between Japan and Sri Lanka there have been visits to each country by government officials of each nation. We have had various cultural exchanges. I thank the Ambassador for facilitating this function and giving our local artistes the necessary encouragement. Our Sri Lankan artistes are essential to this country. They are essential components of the country, said Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development & Cultural Affairs, S.B. Navinna.
The highlight of the Bunka Awards presentation ceremony was the live performance by each award winner, displaying their versatile talents which merited their selection.
Dileeka Abeysekara certainly was the nightingale of the evening with her powerful voice and perfect pitch. Her voice which has been nurtured and tempered with years of practice and experience certainly made an impact on the audience. Nadeeka Guruge, the soulful musician certainly must have had his lesson from a deity of music with his soothing and ethereal music.
Saumya Liyanage and his troupe delivered a swashbuckling performance which was a very good piece of acting. Mr. Kapila Poogalaarachchi, the maestro in black directed his singers with aplomb and his commanding personality brought out the best in them. Poogalaarachchige talent was evident with his inimitable style. Lakshmi Sriharan was the epitome of Bharatha Natyam with her dance that was majestic and perfect. Her dancing was of the highest caliber. She moved like a great cat mesmerizing everyone. The Academic players delivered a frightening performance stunning everyone with its intensity, but the talent was there.
Minister of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development & Cultural Affairs Hon S.B. Navinna graced the occasion as Chief Guest alongside Ambassador of Japan, H. E. Mr. Kenichi Suganuma. Mr. Naoto Honda, President of the Japanese Solidarity Association of Sri Lanka, Mr. Carlo Fonseka, Co-Chairman of the Fund and other distinguished invitees including members of the diplomatic Corps and several renowned Sri Lankan artistes were also present on this occasion.
The 22nd Bunka (Cultural) Awards ceremony, organized by the Japan Sri Lanka Friendship Cultural Fund, was held on November 8 at the Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation, Colombo 07.

Lee ousts rival Lin in China Open semi-finals
FUZHOU, SATURDAY: Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei battled to a tight victory over long-time rival Lin Dan in a tight three-set China Open semi-final showdown in Fuzhou on Saturday.
The 33-year-old Malaysian demonstrated gritty resolve in his triumphant win over the Chinese badminton legend and five-time world champ Lin, winning 17-21, 21-19, 21-19 in front of a packed house at the Haixia Olympic Sports Centre in Fuzhou.

Making compost in the backyard
Some useful tips
* Touch the pile. If it is warm, your microbes are doing their job fine for you. If it is not warmer than temperature outside then feed kitchen waste and manure to the pile. It will increase decomposition.
* Keep the pile moist and not dry.
* Air is necessary for organisms working on your pile. Insert some tree branches in the pile so that they can be occasionally shaken to allow air circulation.
*Air and moisture are your pile's lifelines.
* If your pile is still not decomposing, then maybe you have added too much carbon and too little nitrogen
A better alternative and nature-friendly preference over chemical fertilizers is compost. Nutrient rich, black, soil-like matter otherwise referred to, as black gold of the garden, compost is inexpensive and a great fertilizer for your plants. With a little time and effort, you can make your own compost in the backyard with wastes from the kitchen.
Benefits of compost
Compost improves the soil and in effect keeps your plants healthy. It improves soil structure, aeration, texture and its water retaining capability. Micro-organisms that feed on compost produce nitrogen, phosphorus and the likes, which enrich the soil. In essence, compost is not only a great fertilizer for the plant but also environment-friendly.
Making compost yourself
Any pile of waste organic matter will rot. But in order to produce good compost for your garden, follow these steps:
Get a bin. A compost bin can be of wood, cement, brick or plastic. Place the bin on a level, well-drained surface. A compost bin does not have a base. This allows earthworm and other micro-organisms to enter the bin from the soil and work on compost. Avoid wood bins that may be chemically treated to keep micro-organisms at bay.
To 25 parts carbon add one part nitrogen. Carbon-rich organic matters are brown coloured waste products that include hay, saw dust, old leaves, cardboard, newspaper and straw. Nitrogen-rich organic matters are green coloured products that include green grass, manure, coffee, weeds, and vegetable peels.
First, place around six inches of carbon-rich matter like hay, straw etc. Then top it with a three-inch layer of nitrogen-rich organic waste like vegetable scraps, manure etc. Water each layer in the bin. Add these layers alternately till it becomes say four to five feet high.
Shred all the waste that you dump in the pile as smaller the particles, faster will be its decomposition. Perhaps, a sample pile composition could be four parts of fruit and vegetable scraps, two parts of cow dung, one part of shredded paper, and one part dry leaves.
Protect the pile from rain. Cover the pile, as its contents must not become soggy. They must not be too dry either.
Be careful of what you add. Do not dump diseased or infected plants and vegetables as they may survive even in the bin. Meat, dairy products, bones and fish attract rodents and other undesired creatures to your bin. Also, dog, cat or pig feces should not be put in the pile. However, chicken or cow dung is beneficial in a compost bin. Refrain from adding chemically-treated plants from your garden.
Proper air and water assists decomposition. Keep the pile moist but not saturated in water. Also, using a shovel, turn the contents of the compost bin thoroughly. This will aerate its contents, prevent it from stinking and hasten decomposition. It is advisable to mix the compost once in one or two weeks. Under proper temperature and moisture conditions, earthworms and other microbes will do the decompostion or hard work for you.
In six months your compost will be ready. It must smell sweet like earth and should become dark and crumbly. Spread around two inches of it and till the soil until it mixes well. Though the compost is spread on the top layer of the soil, it releases nutrients to the layers lying underneath.

One year on
MEERIYABEDDA VICTIMS LEFT IN THE LURCH
The over powering stench of sewage engulfs the air around once abandoned tea factory in Mahakanda. Undeterred by the horrible smell, a group of children who skipped school play in front of the building. Four elderly women keep a watchful eye. The sewage pit is spilling over as rainwater fills the pit. The town council truck has to empty the pit. It has done so only twice during this year.
To prevent the pit from overflowing and soiling the entire area we directed the spillage to the river which flows bellow. We know it is not the best solution, but we have no other option. The pit was built for three months only not to last this long, Subramaniam Thalaimahal (36) said.
Thalaimahal along with 330 others lived in the line rooms in Meeriyabedda, in Koslanda Estate, which was destroyed in the landslide disaster of October 29 last year killing 37 people. Officials and politicians flocked to the scene, with promises of rapid action to provide the victims with housing, both permanent and temporary.
Foundation stones were laid not once but twice with much fanfare. Temporary ownership documents were also distributed. But the Promised Land still remains an illusion to the victims. Former minister A. Thondaman and Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa laid the first foundation stones in one location in December last year, in the run up to the Presidential elections.
Subramaniam Thalaimahal, returned to the country three days after hearing of the incident only to find all her family members except for her daughter killed in the disaster.
Another foundation stone was laid at yet another site by two new politicians, in March. The responsibility of handling the project too passed from Urban Development Authority to Disaster Management Ministry.
The pillow passing ensured nothing was done for most part of the year, as the first anniversary of the disaster come to pass. While officers and politicians got their act in order, the victims of Merriyabedda
disaster languish in the shelter which is way past its expiry date. One year later the victims belonging to 75 families are crammed into 50 8 by 8 partitioned rooms in the tea factory with some rooms housing two families.
Kandasami Sinnayya (42) is busy making lunch in his temporary home, while his wife works in the estate. He shares the room allocated to his family with seven other people. They sleep, dress and cook in the same space. Its a tight fit at night he says.
The three adults sleep on one side of the room, then the five children sleep vertical to the adults. We make a room by piling away all our things together, he explains. Apart from his wife and two children, his father and three of his sisters children live with him. His mother died in the disaster. He too was caught in it, but escaped with injuries. He spent a few days in hospital and returned to the camp, where he lives now. As a result of the injuries he sustained he is unable to do much physical labour, the only income generating activity he previously engaged in.
I never got any compensation, I hear that others have got Rs. 40,000. Apparently my medical states that I stayed in hospital for only one day. But I was hospitalised for a few days. It is all in Sinhala so I didnt know what was written in the medical record given by the doctor, Sinnayya explains through a cloud of smoke coming from his kerosene cooker.
With no proper ventilation, the rooms fill with smoke when the residents cook in each room. We had a lot of respiratory issues because of this. In our line rooms we always cooked near a window so the smoke went out of the house. We didnt breath in the smoke, claims Thalaimahal who lives alone in the shelter. She lost both her parents and a sister in the disaster. Her daughter who escaped, is now studying in a boarding school in Colombo under a scholarship programme.
Unable to earn a living due to the injuries he sustained
in the disaster, Kandasami Sinnayya and his
father and three children now survive on the
single income brought home by his wife.
Designed as a temporary facility for three months, social and psychological issues are slowly rising as over 300 people live together in the overcrowded shelter. Many of the women are affected by the lack of privacy. Most young girls are affected and cry saying boys were watching when they change clothes. They are psychologically affected, a government official helping in the facility who declined to be quoted, said.
Family disputes and domestic fights are on the rise, the officer said. Many children who are exposed to it have started repeating the words exchanged. To Thalaimahal, and many others living in Mahakanda factory a solution seems far away. Although officials have now promised to give them houses, all 75 of them before Thai Pongal festival in January, she has no faith in the promise.
Only four houses have been completed up to roof level. They have commenced the work for only 50 houses. They are still laying the foundation for the rest of the houses, she claims. But the victims have nothing else to do but wait.
We will wait till January, thalaimahal says quietly. Disaster Management Centre claims that the delays in the construction of the houses were owing to the administrative lapses and shortage of building materials. The change of government also meant a change of location allocated to build houses. We had two elections since the disaster occurred and the responsibility was passed from ministry to ministry so it took time to get the process going. Then it was difficult to get the money reallocated to our ministry. Now all that is in order, and we have started getting building material, the project will flow smoothly, Disaster Management Centre Director General Major Gen. L. B. R. Mark (Retd) explained.
However, only 53 houses will be put up in the first phrase. The land allocated for the rest of the houses is being prepared only now. According to Badulla District Secretary Nihal Abeysiri, 47 houses of the 53 have been completed close to roof level.
It will take time as we cannot blast boulders with dynamite. We will have to use a breaker and do it slowly. This will take time, explained Abeysiri.

No electricity, no basic facilities:
Long wait for the forgotten of Bandarawela
Ten-year-old Fathima hoped to top the list in Badulla district at this years scholarship exam. Her school teachers had high hopes, so did her parents.
Unfortunately it was not to be. Being cooped up in a small makeshift tin hut in the Poonagala Praja Shalawa ground for the last one year with no electricity to study in the night, she couldnt perform her best. Little did she know that the landslide that destroyed her house in Jalashakanda would also take her dreams away.
The landslide in Jalashakanda area destroyed seven houses, including that of Fathimas. All houses in the area were evacuated and the residents were given temporary shelter in the town mosque, Kovil and the town hall.
After NBRO withdrew the evacuation warning those families whose houses were still standing moved back, others, 34 families in Bandarawela alone had to find alternative accommodation. According to officials in Divisional Secretariat there are close to 150 families who should be relocated immediately due to landslide threats as assessed by National Building and Research Organization.

Many found relatives to live with, some rented houses but like Fathimas family, there were some who had nowhere to go. The Bandarawela divisional secretariat gave them temporary shelter in the Poonagla Praja Shalawa, where the seven families still remain a year later.
Crammed in an 8 by 8 room, they cook, sleep and work in the same space. Two families have got part of the community hall to stay in, while the others have got sheds made of tin sheets. Last week they got permission to build a separate area for a kitchen so they dont cook in the same room as they sleep in. The houses have no access to electricity. So school children living in the facility cannot study at night.
The children try to finish their homework before leaving school, there is no place to study here, explains Fathimas mother, Sameena Begam, 27. Majority of the men engage in daily paid labour work, while the women stay home and make plastic bags.
We used to make about 300 odd bags a day, as we were able to work in the night, but since we have no electricity we can only sew when there is enough light, explains Y. S. Farina, another resident in the temporary shelter. On a good day, women make about 150 bags now.
The loss of income is acutely felt by the families as they struggle to make ends meet. Farina lives with her youngest daughter and her husband, in one of the tin sheds. But she prefers let her younger daughter stay with her elder daughter in Walimada as the camp is no place for a young woman
of 18 years, she says. Owing to her failing health, her younger daughter has returned to stay with them. Its time to look for proposals for my daughter, but how can we do that here. There is no place to even let a visitor in! I dont know for how long we will have to live like this, Farina laments.
Their privacy is constantly invaded. The hall is still used by a number of community associations for meetings every two weeks, at times with close to 100 people in attendance, claims Farina. When such a meeting takes place, Fathima Parshama (29) collects her mattress and other personal belongings and stores them away from where the meeting takes place until the meeting is over.
I sleep in the area the meetings are held as there is no room in the small area allocated for us. My husbands mother, husband and the two children sleep there. So I fold up and remove everything when I know there is a meeting happening. The Samurdi meeting has a large number of people coming in. Its very difficult for us here, Parshama said explaining her difficulties. Her daughter too sat for scholarship exam this year but failed by one mark.
She didnt have a chance to study here, she says. The families have written to all the local authorities about their plight, but assistance is slow to reach them. They have now pinned their hopes on a provincial councillor who has promised to find a solution soon.
But suitable lands are in short supply in Bandarawela. After much deliberation a suitable land has been identified in one of the tea plantations. Recommendations have been sent to the plantation ministry to get the land released to build houses. The ministry is yet to make an assessment on the matter.
I was told by the minister that the plantation company gave a letter regarding the land. I have not been officially informed yet, Badulla District Secretary Nihal Abeysiri said.
Even then, the plantation company has to call for contract to sell the trees. The contractor will have to cut down the trees and transport them out of the site. All this will take time. Only after that can we start building houses, Abeysiri said indicating that for Fathima and her community wait will be long.

[HEALTH WATCH]
Mind your mouth!
World Diabetes Day was celebrated on November 14. According to the latest findings, 20 percent of urban population and eight percent of rural population in Sri Lanka suffer from diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is on the increase among school children and pregnant women. Senior Lecturer attached to the Medicine Department of Clinical Medicine, University of Colombo, Consultant Endocrinologist / Diabetologist Dr. Prasad Katulanda talks to Health Watch about the risk of developing diabetes and preventive measures.
Q: What is diabetes 
A : Diabetes is having higher sugar level in your blood than the reference range. In Type One diabetes, there is no insulin production in the body at all and the person needs to take insulin from outside in order to survive. Type One diabetes usually affects children and young people.
Type Two diabetes is more common than the Type One diabetes and it is caused due to Insulin resistance in the body and non production of Insulin in the body. Initially a person can manage Type Two diabetes through lifestyle modifications and tablets, but later most of them needs insulin as well.
Q: Who are at risk of developing diabetes 
A : South Asian population is at high risk of developing diabetes. Actually there are some genetic markers that have been found out to incriminate as risk factors for diabetes, but it looks like it is not only the genes. It is genes' environment interaction. The same genes were there in our bodies even thousands of years ago, but diabetes was not so common. Now it is believed that due to lack of physical exercise and unhealthy diet, these genes get modified themselves. This is called epigenetic. This gene modification plays a major role in developing diabetes.
Q: What are the complications of diabetes 
A : Diabetes has two sets of complications. If a diabetic's sugar level is very high, he/she can get diabetic coma, various infections etc.
But if a diabetic's sugar level is not in control for a long term, many other complications can be developed in him/her such as Diabetic Retinopathy which causes blindness, Nephropathy which causes kidney failure, Neuropathy which causes lack of sensation in your feet, genital areas, etc. Lack of sensation in feet can lead to amputations and lack of sensations in genital areas in males can cause erectile dysfunctions. One of the more serious complications caused due to lack of sensations is having heart attacks and strokes. These heart attacks and strokes affect young people in a more aggressive way. A diabetic can get a heart attack or a stroke ten years before than an ordinary healthy person gets the same. Those heart attacks can be painless.
Q: How can diabetes be controlled
A : Modifications in lifestyle are very important for any diabetes patient. They should eat healthy food and do regular exercises. The tablets given to such patients are very safe and they never cause kidney damage even when taken for a longer periods. Some people think that long term intake of tablets can lead to kidney damage, liver txocation etc, but all those are only myths. There is no truth in those ideas. These myths cause a lot of problems for diabetics because not taking drugs as prescribed lead to kidney damage etc.
Dr. Prasad Katulanda 
(M.B.B.S), MD (Med), DPhil(Oxford UK)
Q: How about various opinions/beliefs existing among people on diabetes medicines
A : All the herbs that are used by some people that they would lower their blood sugar level are not evidence based. The western medicines are scientifically developed on evidence based systems. They are very closely monitored by International organizations such as FDA in US, European Medical Regulatory Authority etc. But when it comes to herbs, scientific researches had not been done. This does not mean that herbs are not useful. The relevant authorities/institutions should conduct scientific researches and develop medicines out of these herbs which are very potent and safe.
Q: How can diabetes be prevented 
A : Sugar intake leads to many diseases including diabetes. Diabetes patients should not take sugar. But here in Sri Lanka all food and beverages contain sugar. Tea is served everywhere in Sri Lanka after mixing sugar and not separately. People do not reject sugary food and beverages because according to our culture and traditions, offering food and beverages and accepting food and beverages is equally important. Due to this situation healthy people falls sick and the sick (diabetics) people cannot control their diseases. Annually one Sri Lankan consumes 30 kilograms of sugar and this is far beyond the limit.
The latest scientific researches had clearly shown that use of sugar, especially soft/cool drinks have a direct link with developing diabetes. If a person takes one or more such drinks per day, his/her risk of developing diabetes is twice higher than in a person who do not take those drinks. Drinking soft/cool drinks have a major impact on children's health. There is nothing in sugar other than calories. No nutrition in sugar at all. Sugar offers us empty calories only. Sugar can be avoided very easily and it should be done in order to prevent diabetes and many other related health issues.
The persons who use excessive sugar face other health problems such as developing fatty liver which cause cirrhosis. Fructose in sugar causes this condition. Too much intake of sugar increase triglycerides in blood. This leads to heart diseases. The possibility of developing cancer is higher in over weight people. High intake of sugar makes people over weight. Healthy diet and regular physical exercises are very important for all.

Modi receives unprecedented welcome in the UK
A new era in Indo-British relations has dawned. No Indian leader, not even the Mahathma or Shri Nehru or Indira Gandhi has received such a grand welcome, it is unprecedented, Prime Minister Modi was even invited by Her Majesty the Queen to a luncheon, an honour normally reserved for a Head of State; it was not so long ago that then Chief Minister of Gujrat, Mr.Modi was blacklisted by them after the killing of Muslims in Gujrat.
British foreign policy
Its quite an amazing turn around in British attitude, for they have even laid on another unprecedented event, Prime Minister Modi addressed no less than sixty thousand or more British nationals of Indian origin at the Wembly Stadium, at which Prime Minister Cameron and many Ministers of the British government were also present. PM Modi also addressed Parliament. This requires us to speculate as to what the reason could be for this huge change in British attitude towards India.
In this context I must also flag the fact that the Chinese Prime Minister also received an unprecedented welcome when he visited the UK last month. Britain, it is said now has a policy described as a Mercantilist policy towards China.
Does it therefore not indicate a major shift in British foreign policy I presume that Britains involvement with the US in Iraq and the findings of the Chilcott Report may have taught them a lesson; that it is better for Britain not to involve itself in foreign adventures, leaving that to the US and perhaps only lending side support, indicating a retreat by Britain in the area of involvement in the affairs of the world, as was indicated clearly by the British Parliament voting against intervention in Syria. Their main goal therefore seems to be Prosperity through economic development and by plugging into the Chinese and Indian economies.
India and Britain have sealed a 9bn worth of commercial deals in the retail, logistics, energy, finance, IT, education and health sectors, which the PM Cameron had said created or safeguarded 1,900 jobs.
According to the joint statement issued at the end of the visit, India and the UK have stated that they stand united against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and support the early finalization of a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism. They will continue to work together to disrupt all financial and tactical support for terrorist networks including ISIL, al-Qaeda, This joint statement is to create that umbrella framework under which this kind of a security cooperation can continue.
Responding to a question at the joint press conference, Modi said, Both our countries face extreme threat from terrorism, that is why fighting terrorism is not something that just one or two or three countries can do. This is the responsibility of every human Mahatma Gandhi used to say that you only get justice when you know what injustice is. So, who do we designate as terrorists Who helps the terrorists In fact, there is a proposal in the United Nations on this issue, but unfortunately, it is just hanging without any settlement and the UK and we agree that we need to discuss this at length. That is why all well-meaning nations should work together.
Cameron then said, India has suffered on the streets of Mumbai We have suffered on the streets of London, and we have to confront, particularly this Islamist extremist violence and terrorism, which is doing so much damage, not just to our countries but also to the world.(The monstrous attack in Paris will no doubt bring the Democracies together to end this menace)
Make in India
On Defence Cooperation, the joint statement said that UK and India will elevate their Defence relationship by establishing capability partnerships in strategic areas, through which they will work together across the spectrum of doctrine, training and other elements upon which military effectiveness depends.
The two PMs also agreed that their governments would work together to support Make in India on indigenous defence projects.
Cyber security also emerged as a priority during the visit. According to the joint statement, the two countries will work together to provide world-class expertise, education and training to their nations cyber security professionals. The two countries agreed to expand the UKs Chevening Cyber Scholarships programme for India and establish a Cyber Security Training Centre of Excellence.
On online child pornography, they said the two sides will work together, in partnership with their nations technology industries, on the global We PROTECT initiative to combat online child sexual exploitation. In this regard, they said the UK will provide advice on the setting up of the new Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre.
So a new era has indeed dawned in Indo-British relations and we need to take cognizance of it and see how best we can plug into this new relationship to ensure the prosperity of our country.

Myanmar President will hand power to Suu Kyi after poll win
MYANMAR: Myanmar's President Thein Sein on Sunday said historic polls won in a thumping landslide by Aung San Suu Kyi's party were the consequence of his government's reforms and vowed a smooth transition of power.
The former junta general, who shed his uniform to lead the country's quasi-civilian regime five years ago, said the November 8 polls were testament to the political and economic changes that have swept the former pariah state since the end of junta rule.
The election is the result of our reform process and as we promised, we were able to hold it very successfully, he told a meeting of political parties in Yangon, in his first public appearance since the polls.
We will hand this process (of reform) on to a new government, he said, adding don't worry about the transition in comments aimed at calming nerves in the country's first attempt at a democratic-style transition for decades.
Addressing representatives of nearly 90 political parties, many of which were trounced by Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, the Myanmar leader said elections are the duty of a democratic nation.
He appeared sanguine about the resounding defeat of his army-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, which will slip into opposition in the next parliament -- due to sit from February -- with some ten percent of the elected seats in the national parliament, compared to the NLD's 80 percent.
The winning party is responsible for carrying out its duty and other opposition parties should provide checks and balances. That is called democracy, he said.
Thein Sein, a slight bespectacled 70-year-old, has steered the country's dramatic opening up after years of isolation, freeing political prisoners, unleashing a long-muzzled press and welcoming foreign investment.
On Sunday he said international praise for the elections suggested they were free and fair.
Both the president and army chief have agreed to talks with Suu Kyi in the coming days as the country's political big-hitters look to negotiate a long transition which will see Thein Sein retain his position until March.
Observers say it is imperative that Suu Kyi build friendly ties with the military elite, which retains significant political and economic power.
Suu Kyi has already travelled to the capital Naypyidaw, where on Monday she will attend a last session of the old parliament, which will continue sitting as a caretaker legislature until January.
NLD spokesman Nyan Win, who attended Sunday's Yangon meeting, reaffirmed the party's committment to national reconciliation and peace

Number three spot up for grabs
New Zealand will be a watershed tour  chief selector
Sometime this week the national selectors will sit down to pick the squad for New Zealand and considering all what has gone before in the lead up to the tour it is not going to be an easy task. Sri Lanka are due to tour New Zealand next month.
Following the Cricket World Cup in February-March, Sri Lanka hosted Pakistan, India and West Indies at home and after losing to the two Asian teams they finally managed to turn defeat into victory by beating West Indies in the Tests and ODI series.
Winning the series was a good thing its important for a team and it does a world of good for the confidence of a team, said chairman of selectors Kapila Wijegunawardene.
We should not make this West Indies win just a flash in the pan but build on it. After losing two back to back series to Pakistan and India we have turned the corner.
There was more experimentation being carried out during the Pakistan and Indian series now weve kind of honed in on the combination barring maybe one or two adjustments. Its very important for the team to build on this success going forward.
There are still areas to be looked at the boys are still making fundamental mistakes which you cant do at this level. What we are hoping is that they will build on this, have a very good series in New Zealand and go into the England tour next summer with a lot of confidence under their belt, he said.
One of the key holes the four-member selection committee comprising Wijegunawardene, Amal Silva, Brendon Kuruppu and Hemantha Wickremaratne will be hoping to plug as quickly as they can is the vital number three position in the batting.
Following the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara who had held that position for more than a decade, the heir apparent was Lahiru Thirimanne who was groomed to occupy that spot, but unfortunately the left-hander has failed to deliver and the selectors were forced to drop him from the second Test against West Indies and try out 20-year-old Kusal Mendis.
What we planned earlier is not quite working out the way we anticipated, we will be open to making a few experiments in that position to see who best needs to be slotted in there, said Wijegunawardene.
We are going through some of the performances from the A team. When you are limited with the solution you have to take there is some element of risk which is being forced on you trying to identify the right player for the line-up, he said.
Wijegunawardene named Udara Jayasundera, Kithuruwan Vithanage and Kusal Mendis as the players they have in mind for the spot.
Its a matter of getting his confidence back for Thirimanne. It can happen to every player now and again. He needs to work on his technical flaws and get his confidence back, said Wijegunawardene.
I am sure once he gets a couple of good scores under his belt he will be back on track. Right now he is not really fulfilling his role in that position.
Whether Thirimanne can find a place in the side other than at number three, Wijegunawardene said, We need to look at the other positions that we have lined-up in the last three series and see whether they are being fulfilled by the players occupying the slot. We need to look at it with an open mind, what role can be delegated to Thirimanne.
Wijegunawardene said that he was not overly satisfied with the Lankan batting performances in the Tests and called for more improvement.
Our batsmen should have been a lot more assertive and convincing with their batting performances. There are lots of areas to improve in the batting, said Wijegunawardene.
There were some fundamental mistakes being made, batsmen getting out to shots that should not have been played in certain situations, we need to address that. In the Test arena we need our batsmen playing themselves in and occupying the crease and playing the ball on merit. They also need to be a lot more selective in their shot making than what we see now, he said.
Wijegunawardene said that the New Zealand tour could turn a new leaf on Sri Lankas cricket future.
We feel New Zealand is going to be a watershed tour where the new combination has an opportunity to really turn a new leaf and start building for the next 3-4 years, said Wijegunawardene.
If you really play to your potential and be disciplined in your approach there is no reason why we cant come off winning this series. I have a lot of confidence along with the rest of the selectors in the abilities of our cricketers.
We got a very talented set of boys who are capable of reaching great heights if they are really disciplined in their approach which is what we are advocating the coach staff to focus on.

## Title: No Backyard, Problem

Life on the Balcony
No Backyard, Problem
Who among us has not heard these lines of Juliet Capulet "What's in a name That which we call a rose/By any other name would smell as sweet.." And who among us does not know that she says these words standing on the balcony of her father's house, while Romeo, unknown to her, stands in the garden, listening to every word she says. The crucial word here though, to us gardeners, is balcony: the balcony that lets Juliet out, even as it welcomes Romeo in: the balcony on which their love takes root and blossoms: the balcony which continues to play a pivotal role in the modern world, too...providing the same romantic aura Juliet knew on her balcony once long ago, in fair Verona.
Just think about it. You can get to know what it feels like to be in a mini paradise, right in the middle of busy Colombo, if you want to: a place where you can relax after a hard days work, a place that is an intimate, manageable, useful, and absolutely stunning oasis right in front of those French doors leading onto what the Marriam-Webster dictionary says is a platform that projects from the wall of a building and is enclosed by a parapet or railing. In other words, a balcony!
Many experts in the field point out that while not every aspiring gardener may have the option of a garden bed, almost every aspiring gardener can find a place to grow. Flowers, vegetables, herbs, even trees are possible if you have a balcony in your house or apartment.
According to Jean Sleigh, The Garden Genie, it is important, though, that you know what kinds of plants will thrive on your balcony, and which won't. It is very easy to determine this: "You need to watch your balcony over a 24-hour period to see where the sun travels, making a note of the range from gentler morning sun through to scorching afternoon rays." She says the cooler your balcony, the lower the temperature, which will affect the type of plants you buy. This will also affect how much watering you do.
If you include dwarf trees and shrubs in your garden, you'll need to plan ahead to ensure they receive enough direct sun daily. The sun's path changes as the days unfold, so take this into consideration as well. Also remember that most flowering plants need lots of sunlight.
If your balcony is mostly shaded, Sleigh suggests 'Chinese Lanterns' (Fuchsias), Falling Stars, and a collection of the Coleus variety, including the Freckles, Prince and Flamingo coleus. If your balcony is sunny you can go for flowers like roses and jasmines.
It is also important to note the wind conditions on your balcony, says Sleigh: "Many balconies suffer from being windswept. Try to find plants that are built for wind and dry conditions".
Plants on sunny balconies need to be watered daily, and putting dishes under the pots will allow the plant to continue 'sipping' water after being watered. Remember, the higher the balcony, the dryer it's likely to be. Until you get accustomed to the water needs of your balcony garden, check your new plants everyday to make sure they haven't dried out. If the balcony does not get sunlight throughout the day, experts say you have to monitor the plants and water accordingly. It is also advisable to raise pots off the ground, so that water can drain freely. And remember to check now and again that all the pots' holes are still open.
Choosing the proper container is always important no matter where you decide to have your indoor garden. But it is even more crucial when gardening on a balcony. Weight and proper drainage is a key factor, no matter what material you choose. Plastic is lightweight and fashionable. Pots made of cement is another option. Saucers under the containers help if the balcony area does not drain well.
It is also important to use caution when placing containers on balconies. Improper placement creates a tripping hazard or an undesirable step-up for children. Make sure that railings and ceilings can support the weight of flower pots or containers with plants in them.
Sleigh says it is important to 'feed' potted plants, as they cannot get their nutrients from the ground. Also, periodically rotate the pots to allow the plants - depending on the plants' preference - to get maximum sun exposure and to prevent lopsided plants and bare patches.
Sleigh also points out that potted plant gardeners need to monitor the growth of their plants, as every few years, most plants will need re-potting due to being 'pot bound'. This means the roots have completely filled the container, and the plant needs to be replanted. She says to replant into a container twice the size of the first one, and add good quality compost and drainage stones.
If you are lucky, once your balcony garden grows, you will have 'wild visitors' who will drop by to say 'hi'. Miriam Settles who blogs at flatbottomflowers.blogspot says "We get bees, goldfinches and toads (in our balcony garden). And there are hummingbirds who love to stick their beaks into flowers. I try to get them trumpet-shaped blooms." Settles is also resolutely against pesticides. "Once the garden is in, I don't fiddle with it."
That's it. When you have decided what plants can work on your balcony, and what containers to grow them in, it is time to start enjoying the 'feel' of your balcony garden. Sydney Eddison once said that gardens are a form of autobiography, so ensure your green haven reflects your tastes.
Finally, when the heavy lifting is done, when the seeds have sprouted, when new leaves begin to show on the Kathurumurunga plant, prepare yourself for kicking back in your mini paradise, maybe with a glass of lemonade made with the lemons growing right on your balcony.
Chances are, as you smile at the young rose plants basking in the morning sunlight, as a yellow butterfly flirts with the jasmines you will have an inkling of what Juliet meant when she wished,"This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet."
Catch you next week, as you enjoy the 'buds of love' you planted on your balcony, turned into 'beauteous flowers' like 'the fairest stars in all the heaven..." Happy balcony gardening!

NZ conditions were the biggest challenge - Shashikala
Sri Lanka captain Shashikala Siriwardene said that conditions in New Zealand was the biggest challenge after her team was whitewashed 0-5 by the home side in their women's five-match one-day international series.
"When we arrived in New Zealand we were seventh in the table and had hoped to grab a few points. But unfortunately as a team we couldn't perform as we expected," said Siriwardana.
"Conditions were the biggest challenge firstly and this was the first time we all played here. We were also short of few experienced players like Eshani and Udeshika.
"But we learned a lot and thanks to ICC Women's Championship, we have the opportunity to play against the best seven countries in the world. We gained good experience and I am sure we will be tougher for the experience next time."
New Zealand climbed to third place in the ICC Women's Championship following its 3-0 win against Sri Lanka in Lincoln.
The White Ferns went into the series in sixth position on eight points, but has now leapfrogged Pakistan, England and South Africa to third on 14 points, two behind co-leaders Australia, which lies marginally ahead of the West Indies when run-rates are factored in.
India has switched places with Sri Lanka who are now rooted to the bottom of the table on five points.
The White Ferns, in fact, swept Sri Lanka 5-0 in the series but only the first three matches counted towards the ICC Women's Championship. The 5-0 series win, nevertheless, has had an impact on New Zealand position on the ICC Women's Championship on which it has gained two points to move up to 111 points.
The ICC Women's Championship is a qualifying tournament for the ICC Women's World Cup 2017 and is being participated in by Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka and West Indies. The top four sides from the ICC Women's Championship will gain automatic qualification for the event proper which is to be staged in England, while the bottom four sides will get a final chance of qualification through the ICC Women's World Cup Qualifier in 2017.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, November 16, 2015 - 01:00
Obamas rebalance strategy and the India -Africa Summit
The first focus is on the US and the Asia Pacific region. The recent focuses of the US in the Asia Pacific region include five years of intensive negotiations that led to the conclusion of the landmark TPP - the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, President Xi's visit to the United States, and the trilateral summit of the leaders of Japan, Korea, and China. Followed by the historic Burma's election, President Obama's travel to APEC and the East Asia Summit, and the climate conference in Paris.
TPP is a trade deal-intended to support high-paying jobs and strengthen America's middle class. It will cut taxes on U.S. exports; it will help American small businesses to export by eliminating obstacles and opening markets, sets new rules for economic engagement in industries and reduce subsidies to state-owned enterprises abroad that make US businesses less competitive.
TPP is one part of a larger programme to strengthen the Pacific region economically with its roots in APEC. TPP sets high standards on good governance. Countries like Vietnam won't see the full economic benefits of TPP if they don't live up to their commitments to meet international standards on labour rights, for example and includes capacity-building and training that will help the less-developed TPP members meet their obligations. TPP is the economic leg of the Obama Rebalance.
Chinese President Xi's September visit to Washington has focused on cooperation in areas like climate, global health, counter-piracy, Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan and likely ensures disagreements or a crisis do not escalate into a conflict. The US secured a commitment from President Xi that China will not conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft for commercial gain.
South China Sea
Approximately perhaps two dozen U.S.-China leaders meetings since the President Obama took office has in the words of Daniel R. Russel, Assistant Secretary, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs put a "floor" under the relationship. In the South China Sea, China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan contest the sovereignty of many of the islands since sovereignty over islands gives legal entitlements over the adjacent seas. The South China Sea is a rich fishing ground with potentially significant hydrocarbon reserves. The US insists that all claims, territorial and maritime, be made based on international law, and that differences be addressed through diplomatic or legal means since these are vital shipping lanes, carrying over half the world's merchant shipping tonnage.
The US sees Southeast Asia is an important driver of growth, since a crisis there would seriously harm the global economy whilst some of the affected countries are U.S. treaty allies and close friends.
China, in 2014, launched a building spree in the contested waters and, the Chinese military has at times warned U.S. and other ships and planes in the region that they should not enter China's so-called "security zone."
The recent transit of a U.S. Navy ship near several of the disputed features is a reminder that international law applies to the South China Sea. During his visit, President Xi Jinping took a major step forward at the press conference in the Rose Garden with President Obama, when he stated unequivocally: "China has no intention of militarizing its islands in the Spratlys.
"If China follows through on this pledge, the other claimants may follow suit. Another major development was the decision, by the arbitral tribunal under the Law of the Sea Convention, that it has jurisdiction over a case brought by the Philippines evaluating China's maritime actions and claims in the South China Sea, including the so-called "9-dash line."
APEC members
This case won't address the question of sovereignty, but by applying the international law of the sea, it has the potential to resolve some important differences over the rights and entitlements of the claimants to the South China Sea maritime space and its resources.
The meetings in Seoul between the leaders of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea of three major economies and key players in regional security supports regional prosperity and American interests.
After the trilateral, President Park and Prime Minister Abe held their first summit. The leaders agreed to accelerate discussions to resolve the sensitive historical issue of "comfort women"... which would be particularly meaningful since its the 50th anniversary year of South Korea and Japan normalizing relations.
It makes the region more secure and helps the US better address global challenges and seize new opportunities.
Burma conducted a historic election. It fostered a civil society that engages directly with the government. Burma is also negotiating and is engaged in political dialogue with ethnic groups after nearly 70 years of ethnic-based conflict.
President Obama will travel to the Philippines for APEC  and an initiative the U.S. launched in 2011 will bear fruit: APEC members will reduce or eliminate tariffs on dozens of goods that make "green" economic growth easier and cheaper. These reductions complement the strong environmental provisions in the TPP, and will help American green tech companies.
After APEC, the President heads to Malaysia for the East Asia Summit and meetings with ASEAN leaders.
The US invested in ASEAN, through President Obama's regular participation in the Summit by sending a dedicated full-time ambassador.
The Summit brings together the ten ASEAN countries and eight dialogue partners, including the United States, China, and India for a wide-ranging discussion of the leading issues.
It helps the US take the Rebalance global, engaging key players in the Asia-Pacific on issues beyond the region, such as ISIL and the challenge of violent extremism; Iran; cyber security; and global health challenges like pandemic disease.
President Obama is expected to press a forward-looking agenda at APEC and the East Asia Summit - one that supports inclusive economic growth, builds momentum toward a successful outcome at the Paris climate talks in December, increases the region's ability to weather disasters, empowers women as full and equal economic participants, encourages innovation and aspiring entrepreneurs, stands for fairness and the rule of law, and launches ambitious discussions of digital trade and other issues critical to the future of the U.S. and regional economy.
Shortly thereafter, world leaders will gather in Paris for the global climate talks. The U.S. and China are the world's two largest emitters, and the ambitious targets both Presidents set last year, affirmed this year, were important. South Korea is hosting the U.N. Green Climate Fund. Japan has pledged $1.5 billion dollars to it.
The strategic priority that President Obama placed on the Asia-Pacific region when he came to office in 2009 makes sense with a constructive relationship with China and strong ties with other powers like India and Indonesia. Overall the rebalance has generated much.
The second focus today is on the India-Africa Forum Summit.
A record 41 of the 54 leaders of the African Union (AU) came together in Delhi at the end of October for the third India-Africa Forum Summit. Previous summits were held in 2008 and 2011. Previously, the India-Africa summit followed what was called the Banjul formula, that the AU would be represented by 15 leaders chosen from the five founders of the New Africa Partnership for Africas Development (NEPAD)  South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Senegal, eight RECS (or Regional Economic Coordinators), the current and incoming AU Chairperson, and the AU Commission Chair. This year India invited all 54 African Heads of State or Heads of Government.
Scholarships and infrastructure projects
The attendance of all led to some problems, as the dispute between the AU and Morocco over the Western Sahara state called SADR (Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic). Morocco claims the SADR, while the AU recognises it as a full state, which led Morocco to walk out of the AU in 1984. India recognised the SADR in 1985, but then withdrew recognition in 2000. For the Summit, India said it had invited all African Union countries and Morocco.
A full debate ensued at the summit, when Algeria and others tried to insert a clause on colonialism in the draft declaration, which could have been aimed at Morocco, but which could also be read as anti-Western, which India, given its good relations with the U.S. and Europe, wished to avoid. To the credit of senior MEA officials, the situation was sorted out, but not before delaying the declaration and the subsequent presidential banquet.
Indias announcements of $10 billion fund, 50,000 scholarships and infrastructure projects benefit India as much as they do Africa, giving a toehold in a continent where China and the U.S. already have a greater presence. For most countries there, India represents a country with similar problems, tropical climate, and challenges of poverty and disease, but has overcome many of these challenges through low-cost innovations. As a result, Indias rural healthcare, water conservation techniques, scientific expertise, educational facilities and programmes for women mean much more than the amount of aid would. In the IAFS declaration, the clauses on cooperation on food security, solar power technology, satellite weather research and the blue, or maritime economy will probably go the longest way on the India-Africa partnership.
There were four key Summit take aways:
U.N. Reforms - India has been lobbying to reform how the U.N. is governed, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking out for a change to the Security Council to better reflect todays geopolitical realities with PM Modi and his colleagues seeking to win support for Indias candidacy.
Terrorism - The summit also focused heavily on terrorism and defense. The Westgate Mall attack in Kenya and the continuing raids by Boko Haram in Nigeria and neighbouring states were brought up by the Kenyan and Nigerian Presidents, respectively. PM Modi has repeatedly voiced his concern regarding rising terrorism and the need to quash it. Cyber security, maritime security and defense cooperation were also on the agenda.

Climate Change - PM Modi called on the assembled African leaders to join an alliance of solar-rich countries at next month's Paris climate conference. Both African nations and India want to "light up lives of our people and power their future," Modi said, adding that it should be done in such a manner that "snow on Kilimanjaro does not disappear, the glacier that feeds the River Ganga [Ganges] does not retreat."
Development Initiatives-The announcements of $600 million in grant assistance along with a $100 million India-Africa development fund and a $10 million India-Africa health fund demonstrates India's transition to a more active development donor and partner. India-Africa trade currently stands at nearly $72 billion, twice as much as five years ago but still small in comparison to the value of the China-Africa trade, over $200 billion.
Taken together the Foreign Policy initiatives presented here shows different styles of two powerful nations working with regions of strategic importance to their respective interests.

Russian involvement in Syrian War
When I began to ink this text, what my mind was struck by, was, the beautiful Teaching of Wisdom, compassionately elucidated by the Buddha. That is Middle Path and the eternity of its power. The Buddhas path comprises a frank relevance, a doctrinal depth and an orientation to growth for a balanced sophistication of international politics.
If we are to be constrained by the present century of civilization, at first it was by cold war, the said balance was maintained, though it is a debatable proposition. The efficient actors were the Soviet Union and the United States, along with the protagonists of Europe. One camp belonged to the socio-economic formation of Socialism. The other constituted the texture of Capitalism with Europe, having United States at its head. There was Non- alignment too. But, it was not the final resolute factor in the determination of weighty global issues. Circumferentially, the inter-action of the subjects of International Law, appeared to have been in discordance and in incongruence. Nevertheless, the needed balance was always available.
Eternal conflict
Now, the socialism-rooted Soviet Union has ceased and, therein, the governance of Russia is grounded on a polity, structured in to a market economy. The socio-economic status of the two quarters has reached the parity, yet, the contradiction continued to exist. The difference between the two interest-inviting epochs was as follows: In the socialism-Capitalism era, the contradiction had been based on the fundamental doctrines and it was present in the periphery. It was discernible. In the second age of market economy, the discrepancy is not conspicuous at the circumference, but, the conflict seems to have been deposited in the unseen center of the relationship realm.
Russia voices.
In recent times, Russia observed silence in numerous international issues, it could intervene in to. This non-intervening transient tranquility of Russia ushered the affairs of the globe, in to a tangle, the disentanglement of which depicted virtually very much complicated than expected.
Now, dropping its quietude, by intervening in to the Syrian crisis, Russia powerfully voices; Come on guys we are. The empirical emergence of Russia, to wage a powerful battle against the finger-chopping and neck-cutting terrorism of Islam State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) issues a powerful call to all actors of international arena, concerning a fresh relationship balance, that was present in absence, not to be lop-sided in their global relationship management.
Of this, is a voicey and useful warning, Sri Lanka should not and cannot be deaf about. This is a turning point; the foreign policy of Sri Lanka must be subjected to a decent and discernible re-alignment, with the pursuit of the diplomacy of relationship equilibrium. In such a concatenation of circumstances, it is perceptibly pertinent to explore an exegetical elaboration of the pragmatic eruption of Russia in the Syrian crisis.
Non-alignment
Before traversing across the essence of paradigm-shift, being proposed by the Russian factor of military intervention in Syria, the writer of the present text, as an expert of International Law, wishes to digest the concept of Non-alignment as a principle, applicable to the management of international relations.
The Non-alignment has a vision. That is to strengthen national capacities and collective self-reliance of developing countries. The mission of Non-alignment is to contribute to the acceleration and enhancement of national development by strengthening and expanding South-South technical cooperation in the context of international development collaboration. Its objective comprises the achievement of the development goal of developing countries and to attain a sustained, people-centered development and to enable developing countries to become equal partners in international relations, without being victimized by international geo-block politics.
Questions
Can a country, as a subject of International Law, be non-aligned Can, a State exist among the members of the international community and be free from it simultaneously In the void of such a freedom, can a Government be established in the state of Non-alignment These are important questions; one must pose, to comprehend the practicality and fruitfulness of the concept of Non-alignment, as a principle of global relationship regulation.
Opinions
I discussed this subject-matter, yet as an International Law scholar, with many personalities of differing domains. My non-Sri Lankan university professors disagreed with it with no reservations. For American and European international Lawyers, it became a laughing stuff. Yet other intellectuals, unconnected to legal realm had an agnostic approach. The Russian cosmonaut, Comrade Alexiy Koseegin, who was the first human being to come out to the emptiness of the cosmos, in my majestic encounter with him, back in Kiev, said, Gamini, it was only in the cosmos, thousands of miles away from the planet earth, while floating in the air, in the state of non-gravity, I, sometimes felt that I was non-aligned.
Now coming back to Sri Lanka, only two Sri Lankan politicians disagreed with the Non-alignment, as a fruitful and logical principle of global relationship management. One was the JVP leader, Mr. Anura Kumara Dissanayaka, who expressed his view, in one of my politico-philosophical discussion with him at JVP head office at Battaramulla. The other was, the first President of Sri Lanka, J. R. Jayewardene, who, as a brilliant lawyer and as an empirical follower of the Buddha, illustrated what follows: Gamini, your dad, Pani Ilangakoon is a founder member of SLFP and the MP for Weligama. I am the leader of UNP. Yet, I am totally aligned to your father. One can be non-aligned, if it is during ones life time, only on the attainment of Arhathood (enlightenment) or if the case were to be referred to the after death status, it is only in Nirvaana (Liberation) that one can be non-aligned.
Dynamic alignment
Thus, in such a terse exegetical backdrop, the determination of the question; that the orientation of the foreign policy of Sri Lanka must be non-aligned or aligned, generates a heated debate. What the writer of the present textual analysis proposes is dynamic alignment in place of non-alignment. In fact, the history of the external affairs of Sri Lanka is a story of more alignment than non-alignment.. In 1970s it was aligned to India and China. After 1977, its alignment was with the West and USA. Again, from 2010 and onwards, the direction of the Sri Lanka foreign policy had been rooted in China. Yet, during all such periods, what Sri Lanka declared was non-alignment as its foreign policy. This is where; the context of Dynamic Alignment, the present writer suggests stems from. Thus, in the era of dynamic alignment, the Russian factor, the flexing of its powerful muscle in Syrian crisis, erupts in to the very center of the think-tank of Sri Lanka foreign policy.
Involvement backdrop
Now, coming back to our original subject, absorbing the relevance of alignment, it was reported that President Putins address to the Verkhnaya Palaata (Supreme Council) was unexpected, but the whole course of events led to nothing else, but to an increase of military support that went to Damascus, and to the possibility of using Russian military aviation therein. In his recent New York visit, Putin, responding to a question about the possibility of air strikes against the captured territory by Islamic caliphate, said, that he thinks about it and did not rule out, adding, that Russia will only act in full accordance with the norms and principles of international law, that is, with the authorization of the Security Council of the United Nations or upon request of the Syrian authorities.
It is clear, that Damascus had long since, turned to Moscow, with such a request, but it was not officially voiced before the decision. That, apparently, was finally decided after a meeting with Obama, during which, Putin could discuss two variants of Russia's participation in the war, against the transgressor, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria Caliphate (ISIS).
Negotiation and failure
The first, which Putin proposed in his speech at the United Nations, was to create a global coalition and getting for it the mandate of the Security Council. If the United States supported this option, Russia desired to take part in operations in Syria in that format. But, negotiations with Obama made it clear that the United States does not want to go along this path and fight as part of a new coalition in concurrence with Russia.
Besides US insisted that Moscow joined in the existing US-led coalition that does not include Syria and Iran, and on the top of that, the said coalition does not have a mandate of the UN Security Council.
Or else to act on its own. That was the position held by United States. And how else, the US could respond to Putin's warning that Moscow has Assad's appeal that in the case of the rejection, by the United States, of the first version, Moscow will begin separate action in Syria
Final decision
In fact, after the meeting-results with US President, President Putin took the final decision in relation to the subject of Syria that Russia will not act through the dictate of anybody and will be based on the request of the authorities of the republic and the agreement between the two countries, concluded in 1980. The second option was forced on Russia.
The request made by the President of Syria was formally adopted, and President Putin sent an appeal to the Federation Council, which unanimously supported him.

The president himself has called the three main conditions for the use of the Russian army in the war, while stressing that Russia is not going to plunge headlong into the conflict, which has deep roots and different reasons:
1. the Russian military will support the Syrian army only in its fight against terrorist groups;
2. it is only the application of the Russian Air Force and participation in ground operations is excluded
3. the support will be limited to the period of the operational attacks of Syrian army
This would mean that Russian military aviation helps the Syrian army to regain control of the country, destroying the armed forces and communication structures of Islam State of Iraq and Syria terrorists and those hired terrorists who do not belong to Damascus, and then to leave Syria, indeed, retaining a continuing Russian military base in it.
This form of Russian participation, and its major goal, the Russian Leader styled, the destruction of the militant, Islam Sate of Iraq and Syria terrorists, in the territories, they unlawfully seized, causing blood, pain and thousands of agonizing deaths. The Russian President further warned: Russia must act pre-empt, rather than waiting for them to come to our house. The President recalled that the ISIS Caliphate has long declared Russia, an enemy and in its ranks fight thousands of immigrants from Russia and former Soviet countries.
New mission and vision
Warning appears to be the main purpose for which Russia went to war. But the war in Syria has many dimensions, each of which has its own importance for Russia in particular and a discerning weight for the glob in general. Namely, this is where, a new and a dynamic redesign of global and regional geo-politics flexes its muscle for a new vision and a fresh mission.
The Department of the Diplomacy of the Ministry of External Affairs of Sri Lanka and the Governing Leadership of Good Governance, with President Maithripala Sirisena at its apex, will have to consider these international relationship revolutions and manage their fruitful regulation with circumspection in order to be seeded in a fertile diplomacy equilibrium to benefit Sri Lanka as a whole. Here are the three most important ones:
Dimension A
It is Syria itself. Who needs a global and a dragging war in the region, a war that could escalate into the culmination of a nuclear war and become the start of a new world war The Americans or Russians It is a big question with capital B. Even if one were to believe in the theory of controlled chaos, one must recognize that some states of vested interest are now seeming to be losing the Middle East. It is too great a price for any long-lasting goals on a global scale.
Unification of Syria
Now, no one, already, has the strength and will, to gather the scattered stones - the Damascus too is no longer able to do so. A particular vested interest, like the Saudis, dream to overthrow Assad. Iran, a Shiite country, can not intervene in full force, risking sharpening the so propagated slogan- Sunni-Shiite war.
And in these conditions, what is consolidated is the terrorism of Islam State of Iraq and Syria Caliphate that everyone recognizes, the main threat to the world. Given this, the only means to stop the Caliphate terrorism growth in the region is, the restoration of a unified Syria, as early as possible.
Russian approach to Syria, subsequent to the extirpation of the terrorism of Islam State caliphate, shall be in what follows: (See table above)
Dimension B
It is the Middle-east region itself and not a particular country. Russia is not interested in the collapse of Syria. Its collapse will hit across the Middle East region - an area of Russias national interests and what really attracts Russia is a region-wide picture, across the Middle-East.
Russias exit
Loud was the exit of Russia from the Middle-east region. On the eve of the unfortunate collapse, the Soviet Union did not stop the campaign against Iraq, and then completely melted in the air, like a genie in Muslim tales. National interests in the region were betrayed, thrown out and forgotten, but what to say about the Middle East, when the same has been done in relation to their own country and neighbouring regions.
From zero, Russia began to return to the Middle-east region, and after the Arab Spring, Russia went to work actively with all the countries and to develop a comprehensive regional policy. Against the backdrop of the chaos that resulted from both domestic crisis and international geo-politics of some vested interest in the Middle-east region, Russian position had to be reshaped and strengthened.
Redesigning processes of the geo-politics of the Middle-east region are shown, not only to have begun, but also to be continuing. And exactly, this is the useful Russian call, the writer of the present text heralds above. With all the differences with the neighbors of Syria, the fact of Russias consistent support for its ally was, for countries in the Middle-east region, the best proof of the seriousness of the strategic and powerful return of Russia, to the Middle East, and of Russias absolute fidelity, total dedication, ceaseless allegiance and motivational exactitude to the given word.
Dimension C
It is the international impact itself. Of course, the war with the finger-chopping and neck-cutting terrorism of Islamic Caliphate refers to the issues of global level - both on the level of ambition of the caliphate, and the complexity of defeating it. And to understand this, it is not even necessary to consider the caliphate as a Project of certain vested interest. In reality, some are just trying to use Islam State and the terrorism of its members, to meet their own goals, wherein indeed, about any control over the caliphate cannot be even spoken about. Yet, one can just imagine what would happen, in the event of a victorious march to an Islamic state and its geo-politics redesign.
ISIS intimidation
However, the natural tendency of many Muslims to unite, and the caliphate was a prerequisite for the formation of what is now called the Islamic caliphate headed by the Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The intervention of external players: special services and then the authorities of the West, the Gulf, Islamist radicals from around the world and Islamist armed insurgency such as al-Qaeda, turned the territory of Iraq and Syria in to an unprecedented domain of experiments,.
Wherein, finger chopping and head cutting videos of infidels were made, as if specially designed, to weaken the will and to impair the courage of the world, to resist and get terrified, turn away and leaving the territory of the Caliphate alone. The Management of circumstances between Russia and ISIS has culminated in to a level, as it was between the Government of Sri Lanka and LTTE terrorists. First crush and defeat, then to deal with those who called themselves what. This now is the only acceptable approach. And the fact that Russia is going to muster its military might to materialize the above, would mean that it takes on a huge responsibility. And this responsibility and determination of Russia, are not only just making all propaganda of vested interest funny, about the isolation of Russia or the slogan  Russian threat to the world,. On the contrary, it will clearly show the international community, who is who and the peace and balance of power-oriented alignment with super powers in the relationship regulation of international domains, is an indispensable imperative.
Global trust
The aggression of the certain states has always been aimed, not at eliminating the threat to their security itself, but at scrapping countries for the establishment of an order of privileged geo-politics, in which such states would be the conductors and beneficiaries. And now Russia goes to war and surprisingly, again at the request of the legitimate government, that is the Syrian authorities, who are trying to save the country from the consequences, of the same alien aggression.
Herein, Russia can be seen to be demonstrating, that Russia is the main defender of national sovereignty of any country in the world, and that may be relevant for any country in the era of economically forced geo-politics of globalization
Sri Lanka cannot be bereft of the immense dimension of this diplomacy depth. No super power, Russia included, must be under underestimated. What is need is the discovery of right super-power international balance, through the insight of doctrinally and pragmatically armed diplomacy experts, for Sri Lanka to benefit.
Diplomacy is not a domain of dogmatic fools of inflexibility, rooted in vanity, deposited in vainglory and conceit. It is a beautiful art and science of the establishment of international relationship equilibrium. This is the fruitful call of Russia, the writer of the present text heralds above.

Shipping fears as Rhine falls to lowest level in 40 years
THE NETHERLANDS: The Rhine has been hit by its longest period of low water in 40 years, Dutch officials have said, raising inland shipping costs and fears of collisions on one of Europe's busiest rivers.
"The Netherlands is currently hit by the lowest water levels in the Rhine since 1976," the Rijkswaterstaat, the department tasked with dealing with transport infrastructure, said Wednesday. On Monday "the 1976 low water level record of 120 days was broken and it's expected that the situation will continue," it explained in a statement.
As a result, the river's draft has fallen by at least a third, meaning more smaller ships are needed to transport the cargo.
That in turn increases the risk of collision as the mighty waterway - an artery serving the Netherlands, Germany, France and Switzerland - narrows in width due to falling water levels.
"The situation in Germany is particularly worrisome," said Marja de Vet, editor at the Dutch specialist shipping magazine Schuttevaer. "As from this week, large ships are unable to get through a passage in the river," she said, referring to Germany's Rhine Gorge. The Gorge is notorious for its strong currents including at the Lorelei, a huge rock on a scenic but particularly dangerous bend in the river.
"At this moment the water level is so low that only a limited number of our ships can use the river," added an official at a Rotterdam inland shipping company. "With a narrowing in the waterway, there is indeed more risk of collision," he said, asking not to be named. The Rhine is one of the world's most frequented inland waterways and some 600 ships cross the Dutch-German border on a daily basis, says the Strasbourg-based Central Commission for the Navigation of the Rhine. - JAPAN TIMES

The Sri Lanka Freedom Party will not be able to win the upcoming local government election if the campaign is headed by President Maithirpala Sirisena, Sri Lanka Freedom Party Pathadumbara Organizer and Parliamentarian Lohan Ratwatte said. SLFP grassroot level members oppose the chairmanship of President Sirisena as they believe that he is responsible for the SLFP's debacle. Ratwatte also invited SLFPers holding positions in the Yahapalana government to come and work for the victory of the SLFP. He said each parliamentarian should represent the government or opposition. But presently more than 50 parliamentarians do represent none of these and hope to take a decision with regard to this in the future.

Sri Lanka talks resuming Iran oil imports
Iran and Sri Lanka have begun new talks to resume oil shipments to the Asian country, head of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) Roknoddin Javadi says.Sri Lanka was dependent almost entirely on Iran for its crude oil supplies before halting imports under US pressures in 2012.

Javadi said Iran is ready to resume sales when sanctions are lifted on the Islamic Republic in early 2016. Irans oil negotiations have started with Sri Lanka, the Mehr news agency quoted him as saying.

He said numerous talks have been held with Sri Land and other traditional oil customers over the past few months to resume Iran's exports.

All the countries are serious about purchasing crude oil from Iran, he said, adding we believe we will have suitable conditions.

Javadi, however, stated that resuming exports to traditional clients will be time-consuming, Mehr reported. Sri Lanka has been importing oil from Oman, Saudi Arabia and the UAE since sanctions were imposed on Iran.
Before the sanctions, the Asian country bought almost all of the 50,000 barrels of oil which it needs per day from Iran. Sri Lankas only refinery, the Sapugaskanda plant, is configured to run on Iranian light crude.

US sanctions have left Sri Lanka struggling, with its sole refinery facing shutdown from time to time amid shortfalls in the absence of Iranian crude. According to officials, the facilitys switch to processing alternative crudes has reduced the yield. For instance, processed products from Oman light and Murban crude of Abu Dhabi have been 20% lower than those from Iran light. Saudi Arabia's light has also higher sulfur content than the Iranian grade.

According to Sri Lankan Petroleum Minister Susil Premajayantha, every 5,000 metric tons of Iran light yielded 1,250 tons of gasoline and 1,200 tons of gasoil. This ratio worked out to drop to 600 metric tons of gasoline and 1,400 tons of gasoil when Saudi light was used.(iran-daily)

To strive, to seek, to find  a career in poetry
The previous and current young poet laureate for London offer their tips for a career in poetry, from online networks to how to combat a blank page
Reading is key
In any artform, you learn from those who came before. Poetry is no different. Reading widely allows you to assess the styles of poetry that speak most to you. Being able to critically assess work that you like and to understand what it is that resonates and connects with you is just as important as identifying what you dislike and assessing why and what you dont want to replicate.
Reading around the subject of writing and about the lives of other writers also helps to ground your work. In a job that can seem transient and intangible, experiencing first hand the effect that good writing can have is immeasurable.
Build a network
Writing can be an isolating path; you spend a lot of time alone with your thoughts, reflections and words. The writing communities that Im part of, notably Burn After Reading, which is full of committed, talented writers, keep me motivated.
I have a group of people I can share work with and ask for opinions, help or stimulus. Theyre a constant source of inspiration and support. Find a group of like-minded people with whom you feel comfortable sharing first drafts and thoughts. Join a writing group, attend an open mic, follow other writers on Twitter, engage in conversations and build a base of creative people.
How to combat the blank page
A blank page can be intimidating. I often begin writing by freewriting, a technique in which you give yourself a designated time limit  perhaps five or 10 minutes  and write without stopping. You can write about whatever you want: pick a sentence out of a book and begin with that if you cant think of anything.
The idea is to get raw material on to the page. With freewrites you use the creative side of your brain and keep the editor out of the way until later.
Another tip is to find a poem you like and write a response to it: what do you want to ask the poem, the speaker, the poet Try to carry on from where the poem stopped  what new direction can you take it in
Get your voice out there
If you have something to say, use the means at your disposal to say it and distribute it. Set up a simple WordPress site or Tumblr where you can share your work (recorded on your smartphone) direct with audiences. Film a video of yourself performing and upload it to YouTube, or record a track and upload it to SoundCloud. These avenues allow you to get your voice out there for others to hear and appreciate.
Write about whats difficult
What are you most dreading to write Often thats the very thing you need to write about the most. Its easy to get caught up in thinking that you should write about certain topics or in a specific style, but doing this only masks what you truly want to say.
Listening to what you need to write is a necessary skill for a writer. Its in writing about whats difficult, painful and embarrassing that will connect you to the reader, but its also where you can find light and humour.
Even if you never share that particular piece of work, its always there to reflect and work on at a later point if you choose. It will also free your mind to write about other things.
Set yourself clear goals
Set yourself practical goals and be clear about what success means to you. Do you want to write and perform as a career What steps should you take to get there Who can you speak to to help shape practical goals in achieving this Or is writing regularly for yourself a more desirable goal
Recognise this, too, as a success and create conditions to enable you to write regularly.
For example, book out a regular time every week to write and try to stick to it or start an anonymous writing blog. Importantly, dont get swept up into other peoples versions of success. Be sure of what you want from your writing and create your own action plan.
Be inspired by other artistic forms
Reading poetry and discovering other writers is so important, but I also think good writing finds interesting crossovers with other artistic mediums. Immerse yourself in different artforms, whether film, dance or theatre, to see how this might inform and shape your writing, particularly if it is in a topic or area that you are writing about.
It might also leave you open to developing interesting collaborations with other artists, which could lead you down an interesting trajectory you hadnt previously envisaged.

Terror casts shadow over City of Light
FRANCE: The Eiffel Tower was closed, the Champs-Elysees was lifeless and museums, markets and schools were shuttered on Saturday as Paris reeled after the bloodiest terror attack in French history.
A city famed for its glamour and bustling streets seemed garbed in mourning as Parisians struggled with the shock of the multiple attacks that claimed scores of lives.
On Saturday night, when the streets would normally be thronged with weekend revellers, an eerie silence descended on the city.
A few dozen people defied a ban on assembly to gather in Place de la Republique, a stone's throw from where the attacks took place and where a vast crowd came to mark the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January.
"This is the centre of France. This is where we gathered for Charlie," Gabrielle Paoli, 24, told AFP.
Paris City Hall ordered all city facilities closed, including schools, museums, libraries, sports halls, swimming pools, tennis courts, food markets and district town halls.
Only civil registration offices, to record marriages, would be open, authorities said, adding that security would be beefed up at district town halls.
It was the second terror strike in less than 10 months. In January, 17 people were killed, including five of the cartoonists at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in jihadist gun attacks.
In the Place de la Bourse, a large square near the Paris Opera, traffic was unusually thin and pedestrians were few.
"People are worried," Jean-Louis Masson, 50, who lives locally, told an AFP reporter.
"You can see that in the SMS messages that are going around. We were concerned for one of our children who was out last night, and we called to make sure she got home."
Masson's son, Adrien, 13, said he was a "bit worried. You get to be afraid that something could happen."
In a cafe, a man who gave his name as Luc, aged 46, said he was stunned.
"I just don't understand. They keep telling us that they've thwarted attacks, that they've made arrests, and here you've got guys shooting at everyone in a concert hall in the centre of Paris.
"They're unable to protect this city, that's what it's about."
The street outside the Galeries Lafayette department store was empty, after the emporium -- which initially declared it would remain open -- closed its doors.
At the approach of the Christmas season, the store's glitzy windows are usually crowded by young Parisians and tourists eager to watch automated puppets in scenes from popular tales.
On Saturday, the puppets went through their movements without an audience as fairy music played in the background. A line of Star Wars stormtroopers stood grimly to attention, impressing no one.
At the Starbucks coffee house in the Boulevard Haussmann, a barista shrugged his shoulders. He and his colleague had seen three customers in an hour and a half.
"It's empty," he said. "Normally, we have five or six people here at any one time. They are often tourists who stay in hotels in the Opera district and want to save on the cost of breakfast."
Around the Champs-Elysees, Gucci, Zara and other brand stores were closed and cafe terraces were empty.
At newspaper kiosks, dramatic headlines and pictures likened Paris to a combat zone, after jihadists attacked crowds and restaurants goers.
"War in the heart of Paris," the conservative daily Le Figaro said. "This time, it's war," Le Parisien said.
Police said all public demonstrations in the Paris area would be banned until Thursday, and the French secretary of state for sports issued instructions to regional sports federations to cancel matches this weekend. - AFP

Wanna know a secret
Loveable should have been her middle name. Working with integrity, honesty and compassion Pooja Gauthami Umashankar embraces the best of what Sri Lanka and India has to offer.
She has proven her mettle in acting in Indian films like Pori, Thagapansamy, Thambi, Pattiyal, Githan, Ula Ket Kume, Jay Jay and Altagasam and Sinhala movies like Anjalika, Aasai Mang Piyabanna, Yahaluvo, Suwanda Danuna Jeevithe and Kusa Paba.
Indian director Balas Naan Kadavul set a new challenge for her. Her performance as a blind beggar won many accolades. Her latest film, Professor Sunil Ariyaratnes Paththini is slotted for release soon.
Q: You are more in Sri Lanka than in India now
A: Yes, my granddad is 98 and I intend to spend as much time with him as possible. He is my most favourite person in this whole world! Love him to bits...
Q: Where do you like to go on vacation and what do you like to do
A: I love Sri Lanka. Its my home away from home and a vacation packed together. Thats never going to change. Vacation for me is being around people who enjoy life to the fullest. It is being around people who have hearts full of love and are full of laughter. So, everyday is a vacation because I surround myself with happy people.
Q: What was your worst subject in school and why did you dislike it
A: I never liked maths. Guess it was because I never could understand it. LOL. Now that I think about it, I believe that if I liked the teacher teaching me the subject I am sure I would have loved it too as much as I loved history, civics, political science and law. I have had wonderful and amazing teachers teach me these beautiful subjects.
Q: What does marriage mean to you
A: As a girl/woman I believe that who I want to marry is the single most important decision I make in my adult life. I need to ensure that I will be able to fulfill my duties as a wife to my fullest capacity.
I should be a blessing to my husband. We should become one in unity, in essence, in purpose and in mind.
I should be a comfort to him and I should rejoice in him, relish his love and cherish him dearly.
I should be able to defend him when the time arises and never take him for granted. Most importantly I should be able to respect him. All of this is not difficult at all as long as I find myself a righteous man because then he leads a blameless life.
I want a man who will love me. It is as simple as that. I need love in its truest and purest sense. I deserve it and anything less I reject.I am no longer engaged to Deepak Shanmuganathan. We broke off the engagement. That relationship as a husband and wife in the future would never work. So I decided to walk away while it was still possible. I do not endorse or subscribe to the concept of a divorce.
Q: If you were given an opportunity to spend a day with anyone on earth, who would you choose and why
A: I wouldnt change anything in my life at the moment. Its perfect. God gives me the opportunity to meet wonderful people on a daily basis.
I learn and unlearn many things. The situations I am put through and the people that walk that path with me bless me and show me how gifted I am. I choose to spend my day with the very same people I come across on a daily basis.
Q: What irritates you most
A: There are a load of things that can get to me. Here again I choose to let the positive in and keep the negative out. I choose on a minute basis to never let irritation get the better of me.
Q: What do you value most in a human being
A: LOVE. Thats the answer to all problems, situations and conditions.
I believe each of us has within us a heart full of love that when used at its fullest potential has the power to heal, spread harmony, unite all and can achieve just about anything we put our minds to.
Q: What is your ideal combination of a meal
A: I love home cooked food. I will never get tired of eating it. At home I am assured of a clean, healthy and tasty meal. It is a meal cooked with love. Thats the best combination I would say.
Q: What is the best acting tip that you can give to a newcomer
A: Enjoy your work. Be honest to the character. Work hard. Dedication and sincerity needs to be put into your work. Discipline and time management is of utmost importance. Never compromise.
Give it your 100 percent. Work so hard until such time where you no longer have to introduce yourself. Trust me, it works like a miracle.
Q: What do you think is your weakest point and what is your strength
A: My weakest point is that I trust whole heartedly and always give the benefit of the doubt to another. It has gotten me into loads of trouble. But I still continue to do so because my weakness is also a blessing to me. I am able to pick myself up after getting beaten to a pulp and bounce back into life like all is brand new. I believe that restoration in my mind and spirit comes from God. He doesnt just repair my broken heart, spirit, body, soul and mind. He restores it to brand new and to an even better condition than it was in before. My biggest strength is God. When I have him with me I believe I need not look for anything or anyone else. He guides me and leads me. I happily follow.
Q: If you can do a role in a remake, which would you choose and why
A: Sound of Music or My Fair Lady. Even Maine Pyar Kiya is up my alley. I love romance and the promise and hope it holds. I like doing these feel- good films.
I like the fact that these movies made me smile, laugh, dance, sing and cry and the works. LOL. As you can see I am a romantic fool!
Q: If you can travel back in time which moment would you like to relive
A: I believe that my best is yet ahead of me. I have enjoyed every moment of my life till now.
But this is for sure. My best in life is yet to come. So I would like to look on forward instead of going back in time.
I would like to let memories be memories and look towards my future, towards achieving my goals and fulfilling my calling here on earth.
Q: One thing you would like to do before you die.
A: Spread as much love, joy, laughter, kindness, hope, patience, peace, gentleness, goodness, faithfulness, confidence, hugs, respect, self control etc.
Q: What are you up to these days
A: I am waiting for the release of my new film Paththini.
Q: Three lesser known facts about yourself.
A: People think that I am a machine that smiles, laughs and plays all the time! They forget that I do get tired and I can run out of patience at times.
I cry when I get angry. I would give up my acting career if my husband wants me to do so.

Warped sense of humour can be early sign of dementia
* What is dementia
Dementia is a loose term used to describe different degenerative disorders that trigger a gradual loss of brain function - thinking, remembering and reasoning.
*Is it the same as Alzheimer's
Alzheimer's is the most common form of dementia, accounting for around 62 per cent of all diagnosed cases.
* Who gets it
In most people, symptoms first appear in their mid-60s. An estimated 850,000 people in the UK have dementia, with the number set to rise to more than a million by 2025.
* Is there a cure
The disease is progressive and currently incurable, though there are treatments to reduce the symptoms. In the end it robs the sufferer of the ability to carry out the simplest tasks.
* What causes it
The causes are still not completely understood. Scientists believe genetic, lifestyle and environmental factors all play a role.
Scientists find that patients with frontotemporal dementia had begun laughing at tragic events in the news or in their personal lives years before they were diagnosed
The development of a warped sense of humour could be an early sign of dementia, scientists have found.
The families of patients with frontotemporal dementia revealed with hindsight, they had noticed that loved ones had developed a darker sense of humour years before the disease had been diagnosed.
Many said their relatives had begun laughing at tragic events in the news or in their personal lives, such as one who was amused when his wife scalded herself.
Experts from University College London, who questioned the friends and family of 48 patients, said more research was now needed to understand how and when changes in humour could act as a red flag for dementia.
Frontotemporal is one of the rarer forms of dementia, but one of the more common causes of the disease for those under 65. It affects the area of the brain that controls personality and behaviour.
As opposed to Alzheimer's, which causes difficulty with memory, patients can instead lose their inhibition, become more impulsive and struggle with social situations.
Dr Camilla Clark and her team asked the friends or relatives of patients to rate their loved one's liking for different kinds of comedy - slapstick comedy such as Mr Bean, satirical comedy such as Yes, Minister or absurdist comedy such as Monty Python - as well as any examples of inappropriate humour over the last 15 years - well before any diagnoses.
Nearly all of the respondents said, with hindsight, that they had noticed a shift in the nine years before the dementia had been diagnosed.
This included laughing at events others would not find funny such as a badly parked car or a barking dog.
Third of people born in 2015 'will develop dementia'
Dr Clark said: "As sense of humour defines us and is used to build relationships with those around us, changes in what we find funny has impacts far beyond picking a new favourite TV show.
"We've highlighted the need to shift the emphasis from dementia being solely about memory loss. "These findings have implications for diagnosis - not only should personality and behaviour changes ring alarm bells, but clinicians themselves need to be more aware of these symptoms as an early sign of dementia."
Dr Simon Ridley, from Alzheimer's Research UK, which partly funded the study, said anyone concerned about changes in their behaviour should speak to their GP.
"While memory loss is often the first thing that springs to mind when we hear the word dementia, this study highlights the importance of looking at the myriad different symptoms that impact on daily life and relationships," he said. "A deeper understanding of the full range of dementia symptoms will increase our ability to make a timely and accurate diagnosis."
The study is published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Williamson and Taylor dominate Perth Test
Perth,Sunday: New Zealand batsman Kane Williamson and Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc joined elite company as bat continued to dominate ball on the third day of the second Test against Australia at the WACA Ground on Sunday.

In reply to Australias formidable 559 for nine declared on a placid wicket, the Kiwis were 510 for six at stumps, trailing by just 49 runs.
Ross Taylor had emerged from a form slump and scored his second Test double century to be a career-best 235 not out, with Mark Craig on seven.
Williamson became one of the four youngest players to reach 12 Test centuries when he made 166, while Starc bowled what is believed to be the fastest recorded delivery in Test cricket.
Williamson rarely looked troubled in posting his second century in as many matches, before mistiming a pull shot off Josh Hazlewood and was caught at mid-on by Mitchell Johnson to end a record 265-run stand with Taylor, a new benchmark for New Zealand in Tests against Australia.
He faced 250 balls in 390 minutes and hit 24 boundaries.
The 25-year-old made 140 and 59 in the first Test at the Gabba, which New Zealand lost by 208 runs, and continued that form in Perth.
It was his 12th Test century and only three other players have scored as many centuries at the same age -- the others being Sachin Tendulkar (16), Don Bradman (13) and Alastair Cook (12).
Williamson has made centuries in five of his last seven Tests against Pakistan, Sri Lanka, England and Australia, and in that time he has scored 1,118 runs at 111.80.
Taylor was a little less sure at the crease and flirted with disaster on a couple of occasions, but recovered to post his 13th Test hundred and looked increasingly comfortable during his innings. It was a welcome performance for the classy Taylor, who has been struggling with form for some time and had not scored a Test century since November last year.
In a game where records have been tumbling with incredible regularity, Taylor posted a new benchmark for visiting players at the WACA and also became the first New Zealander to score a Test double century against Australia.
