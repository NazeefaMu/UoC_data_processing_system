## Title: Of disasters, man-made and natural
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, April 21, 2017 - 01:00
Of disasters, man-made and natural
Disasters are many and varied. However, there are principally two types that are prevalent nowadays. They are natural and man-made disasters. Hardly a day passes without disaster striking some part of the globe. Global warming had resulted in a series of natural disasters and destructive weather patterns,
Sri Lanka was considered to be located in an exceptionally favourable location out of danger. As a popular song says there are no earthquakes and volcanic actions in Sri Lanka. However, things do not look too bright for our future as signs of danger are already apparent. Of late our country has also experienced a series of disasters.
Beginning with the tsunami of December 2004 there has been a series of severe floods, landslides with much destruction of life and property etc. We could recall the Aranayake and Badulla landslides, the Salawa Army Camp explosion and now the exploitation at the Meetotamulla garbage heap. Were they natural disasters or man-made disasters Though they appeared to be natural, it was undoubtedly a result of mans interference with the environment or his destruction of it. Nature has a tendency to react violently to mans cruelty to it.
Since disasters could be more frequent in the days ahead it is necessary to have a good knowledge about disasters, their causes and preventive measures. Yet Sri Lankans seem to be hardly knowledgeable on such matters and both the rulers and the administrators do not seem to give it due consideration.
Tsunami disaster
Incidentally it would be interesting to recall an incident that happened at the time of the tsunami disaster of December 2004. When the earthquake that triggered the tsunami took place the United States Pacific Tsunami Warning Station contacted our Foreign Ministry in Colombo and warned about it. Being a holiday only a minor servant had answered the call but he was ignorant of the phenomenon of tsunami so that he did not act on the message received. The authorities ignored it even after the local and international media reported the incident. The cost paid was enormous- about 40,000 dead.
To take matters worse even the Pallekele station  the only one that was working at the time -monitoring seismic activity was closed on that day as it was a public holiday. The Minister in charge then was Dr. Tissa Vitharana, who strangely enough justified the closure instead of acknowledging the lapse of duty. It was as if disasters too take holidays seriously!
Since the frequency of disasters seems to have increased, it is necessary to keep the public well aware of their nature and repercussions. Perhaps it would be best to include disaster management to the school curriculum to equip the future generations with the ability to face them knowledgeably.
Perusing the media subsequent to the Meetotamulla disaster one gets sick of attempts of politicians and administrators to blame one another for it, instead of pooling their resources to find a quick and long-lasting solution to guarantee a non-repetition of similar disasters. It is futile to blame the present or last government as both as well as even earlier governments are responsible for the neglect and indifference shown towards the garbage disposal problem by all of them. Those who wax eloquent now on solutions were also waxing eloquent post the tsunami and numerous devastating floods that occurred earlier. However, most of the proposals they put up for show then never materialized. In the midst of the tragedy a Minister is repeatedly blaming the people for their protest demonstrations against the garbage heap. He has obviously forgotten that people do not protest for fun and are only exercising a basic right of theirs.
Game of power politics
The blame game and the myriad of proposals are all part of the game of power politics. Most such actions are carried out with a view of future elections and the grandiose projects are forgotten once popular interest wanes. Long after the disasters at Aranayake, Salawa and elsewhere, some victims are still suffering without proper redress. There is hardly a calling of conscience or duty by the country and the people. As a rule it is the poor who are worst affected by disasters. The dearth of pro-poor policies in governance is conspicuous.
At the time of the Salawa explosion, the government blamed the former regime for installing an Army Camp with an ammunition depot in a densely populated area while the former regime insisted that they had a plan to re-locate it elsewhere but the change of government prevented it. Yet nearly a year after the incident the Army Camp is yet to be re-located. Apparently there is no political will or it is beyond the list of priorities.
Both the government and the public seem to be more obsessed with cosmetic projects of city beautification than giving priority to avert man-made disasters such as that of Meetotamulla. Otherwise they would not have waited till the problem developed to colossal proportions. Another cause is the mentality to go for mega projects, to undertake the largest constructions in Asia if not in the world. The garbage problem could have been and must be solved in parallel at local government or district level. The craze for mega projects retards progress, especially in view of the shortage of investments.
Unscientific exploitation of natural resources and the destruction of bio-diversity due to the greed for profit should be stopped. Development should not come at a cost to be paid in disasters. The lowering of the water table due to excessive digging of tube wells, unrestricted import of foreign flora for commercial purposes, excessive sand mining in rivers, unscientific and destructive fishing practices, excessive use of chemical fertilizers etc. have given rise to many health hazards and potential disasters. It would be also unfair to blame only politicians as administrative bodies and officials and law-enforcement agencies are also responsible for the preservation of natural resources and prevention of their undue exploitation. Undoubtedly we are yet far away from good governance.
On the other hand, how could there be good governance when there are no national policies with respect to almost all spheres of social human activity

Fairway Colombo wins 2016 Guest Review Award
The latest entrant in Colombos hospitality sector, the Fairway Colombo recently received the 2016 Guest Review Award by Booking.com.
With an overall score of 9/10, Sri Lankas most technologically advanced city hotel is acclaimed to be the property with the best value in Colombo providing guests with more than their moneys worth in comparison to other locations in the city.
Standing at the end of Hospital Street in Fort, the Fairway Colombo fits in perfectly with the colonial faade. However, upon entrance one is greeted by an entirely modern setting along with the most technologically advanced features.
Another prominent feature of the Fairway Colombo is that every process of the hotel is designed not just for the ultimate comfort of guests but also in order to ensure the preservation of the environment and the conservation of energy.
We have gone to great lengths to ensure that all of the hotels activities and various processes are environment friendly. Unlike most hotels, were not trying to attract everyone; our goal is to attract a particular group of customers to whom these aspects are important, explained Mr. Imal Fonseka, the Group CEO of Fairway Holdings.
Indeed, the very process of checking in is a paper-free process, while every room in the hotel is equipped with motion sensors as a means of preserving energy.
Just as in the lobby there is no paper to be found in the room, not in the form of a menu or telephone directory.
However, the key feature of each room is the IP-TV that offers not just a number of varying channels to suit the interests of the guests, but also a selection of restaurants from which a guest may select their choice of dish and have it delivered to the hotel without ever having to leave the room.
But should one wish to dine out, the hotels location is within walking distance of some of the most renowned restaurants and pubs in Colombo.
Located in the heart of Colombo Fort, the Fairway Colombo offers guests not merely comfort, luxury and hospitality but privacy as well.
Unlike other hotels in Colombo the Fairway Colombo has no ballroom or grand hall or any form of gathering hall, thus maintaining a quiet and peaceful environment for guests.
A popular travel fare aggregator website and travel metasearch engine for lodging reservations, Booking.com lists approximately 1,200,000 properties in 225 countries and books 1,200,000 room nights per day.The site is also available in 40 languages.

I am ready to abolish, prune down Executive Presidency: President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he was either ready to abolish or prune down the powers of the Executive Presidency. I am ready for either. That was my commitment, the President said.
We have now completed two and a half years in government- criticism, allegations and insults are in plenty.
They are very common features of a vibrant democracy, President Sirisena said.
He referred to the past where there had been attempts made to extend the term of the government without holding elections and he brought in Turkeish President Erdogans example to substantiate his claims.
These are not viable options in government. I am not going to talk about the circumstances or background of the story,the President said while saying that a draft Constitution would be ready within the next two weeks for Cabinet to discuss.
We have told the Expert Committee to expedite the matter,the President said.
The President also said the National Audit Bill would soon be brought before Parliament after it has been discussed in Cabinet.
During the previous Cabinet, I promised to bring it in January. I will now direct them to do it as soon as possible,President Sirisena said.
Commenting on the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) and the runway, The President said there were various opinions expressed in newspapers about the standards of the runway which was rehabilitated. Despite these criticisms, the BIA, he said would very soon host Airbus 380; large aircraft and the contractors who did the work at the BIA were locals.
Talking of the duty free shops, the President said that duty free shops were given on an open contract.
Earlier those shops were given to the cronies of ministers. Now we are getting more income than what was earlier. We are getting up to 40 percent compared to the earlier 24 percent, the President said.
He also said that his government expedited the Moragahankanda-Kalu Ganga irrigation projects,
We have to build two more dams and a tunnel of 21km. This will enable us to give water to
Kurunegala and Kilinichchi in the North. Within the city itself, we have started new projects and restarted projects that were abandoned. Nothing will be sold to foreigners on a platter. The Port City was a good example of that.
That was an outright betrayal in the history of this country. The previous government gave free hold land of 200 hectares to China and even my small helicopter could not go over it without the permission of the Chinese government.
That was the worst betrayal in our country, the President added.
Referring to the UNHRC, the President said that his government had been able to put it off by two years, We have to make submissions at the end of two years and we will do what we can.
I am confident that I can salvage the country out of this abyss while protecting democracy and the independence of the judiciary.
The President also said that in the North, the government has completed nearly 60 percent of resettlement work. The primary task now, he said was to resolve the issue of missing people, I will device a scheme for this, the President assured.

## Title: IMF concerned over rise in credit growth in China

IMF concerned over rise in credit growth in China
Going forward in the year emerging markets, in particular Asia could face challenges to its financial stability from the spillovers from advanced economies, said International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Counsellor Tobias Adrian speaking to journalists at the launch of the Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR) of the IMF at the IMF, World Bank Spring Meetings in Washington last week.
Financial experts at the panel noted that the key challenge to financial stability in emerging markets during the year is the spillover from advanced economies failing to get the right policy mix to ensure financial stability.
Financial experts at the IMF also cautioned that political and policy uncertainties in advanced economies could open up new channels for negative spillovers on emerging markets.
The rise in credit growth in China could be dangerous according to financial sector experts who noted that the longer booms last and the larger credit grows, the more dangerous they become to economies.
Credit in relation to Chinas economy has more than doubled in less than a decade to over 200 percent.
We expect credit growth to come down in China and advanced economies to reduce vulnerabilities to the economy, Adrian said.
He said the Chinese authorities continue to adjust policies to limit credit growth of the banking and the shadow banking systems.
However, IMFs financial experts noted that more has to be done by the Chinese authorities to reduce growing vulnerabilities.
The Chinese authorities progress and success is vital for global financial stability, Adrian said.
However, the IMF in its GFSR stated that global financial stability has improved and economic activity has gained momentum during the past six months.
The IMF in its GFSR further states, hopes for reflation has risen and monetary and financial conditions remain highly accommodative. It states investor optimism over new policies under discussion has boosted asset prices.
However, the GFSR states that failing to get the policy mix right could reverse the market optimism.
It states further, in the United Sates policies could increase fiscal imbalances and push up interest rates and global risk premia.
Global shift towards protectionism could have drag down trade and economic growth, triggering capital outflows from emerging markets.
Experts at the panel noted that loss of global cooperation on regulatory reforms could reverse some of the gains that have made financial systems safer across the globe.
Markets expect these adverse developments will be avoided and that policy makers will take steps to implement the right mix of policies, Adrian said.
He said for emerging markets this means addressing domestic and external imbalances to enhance resilience to external shocks.
Global growth could strengthen and deflation risks could continue to fade with the right policy mix. This would benefit emerging markets and advanced economies alike even as interest rates rise and monetary policies normalize, a panellist said.
However, emerging markets could face very trying times with a sudden reversal of market sentiment that could reignite capital outflows and hurt growth prospects.
The IMF estimates that debt held by weaker firms in emerging markets could rise to around USD 230 billion under such a scenario.
Financial experts also noted that domestic banks face the greatest challenges with almost three quarters of them having weak returns in 2016. The GFSR notes that the domestic operating environment for banking plays a significant role.
Weak profitability limits the banks ability to retain capital and thus constraining its ability to weather shocks and increasing risks to financial stability.
While no single structural factor explains chronic low profitability, overbanking is a common challenge. Overbanking takes different forms, for example weak banks with low buffers, too many banks with a regional focus and narrow mandate or too many branches and low branch efficiency, Adrian said.
The inward policies of the Trump administration and protectionist measures could threaten global financial instability according to financial experts.
US policy proposals should aim at increasing economic growth, but should also avoid creating fiscal imbalances and negative global spillovers, Adrain said.
He also noted that emerging market policy makers should address their external and domestic imbalances to ensure financial stability.

It is family!
Drama at Visakha is very much a family affair. The girls have grown together and formed strong friendships and in doing so they have committed 100 percent. Dramatic Moves features the Visakha English Drama Society, a tight knit outfit that has done some excellent drama over the years.
A lot of talent
We have been taking part in Shakespeare Drama at the very first stage. Drama at Visakha has been existing for a long time. We normally take part in Drama Comp. organized by the Royal College Interact Club. We also take part in Shakespeare Drama Competition. Those are the two major events we normally take part in. Recently we have started doing some public productions for the benefit of the Drama Society, to showcase the talents of the students. We have inter-house drama competitions every year  we award the best actor, best actress and supporting portrayals, said Teacher in Charge Asiri Sammanani Payagala
When it comes to talent they get the best here from all over the country.
From the scholarship exams we get quite a lot of talented girls into our school, but this is not to say that we dont have talented girls in our school. We do have quite a lot of talented girls. So this is a good opportunity for them to showcase their talents. They are good in choreography, music and directing. They are quite talented in all those areas. For Drama Comp. some of the seniors directed a few years back and we have won first place, pointed out Payagala
The parents of the girls are very understanding and it has been very much a process. They let the girls do drama because they know how important it is to the girls.
Without their support I would have never come this long. Because they have always been the pillar of strength and the staff members are also very cooperative. The principal has always been there with us, where drama is concerned. And especially the old girls, they love drama and they have financially supported us during many given times. They have also supported us, even for the public productions. And every time when it comes to Shakespeare drama they have supported us financially with the costumes and directors fee, explained Payagala.
At Drama they have been winning for the last couple of years.
A good way
Drama Comp. we have won many years. When it comes to practices we think about our girls schedules as well. There are a lot of extra -curricular activities running at school, and many of the girls are not just limited to drama. So we adjust according to their time frames. But we have regular practices every Wednesday from 2pm  4pm, added Payagala
The school cover all genres  comedies, tragedies and tragi -comedies.
We have faced the challenges of finding a director. At first we did not have a permanent director earlier. So it was a bit of a challenge for me when I took over. Luckily we found Chalana Wijesuriya. He has been hardworking and doing the best for the girls.
When it comes to Drama competitions, it takes a long time for the girls to get prepared for that. It takes at least one month.
It is not easy for us to take part in lots of competitions. Throughout the year if we keep on taking part in competitions, the girls cant do any other work. The work ethic is hard work with fun. I dont mind the hard work because at the end of the day when I see them performing on stage that is all I care about. I dont mind going through all the hard work. That is all I look forward to. That is the best, elucidated Payagala
When they did Julius Caesar the female version. The girls performed brilliantly there but did not get selected to the final round at all.
We also did the Brothers Grimm Fairytales. There was a lot of team work. We had a big cast. The play was quite outstanding. We enjoyed doing it and the audience also liked it. I think that was a good play. We did Candid last year.
The audience liked it. I have watched the performances with quite a lot of enthusiasm. Drama is a good way for them to become confident young ladies. It gives them a lot of confidence. I have seen the timid ones becoming very confident. Sometimes they dont even know they have that talent. They have discovered their talents, summed up Payagala
Director Chalana Wijesuriya has been with the girls for a long time. The first opportunity he got after leaving school in 2012 was to work with the girls. Since then he has been with them. He feels it is quite fun working with the girls and that it is a challenge. They are quite hardworking. DRAMA RESULTS AT VISAKHA

Togetherness, force behind success
President Hiruni Herath felt that the influence of togetherness and the bonds they have formed have contributed a lot to their success.
It is our togetherness and sense of family and throughout the years however much all the trouble we have gone through we have always been together as a family. We have faced so many troubles. We have committed 100 percent and we have been here as a family. I keep coming back to the fact that we are a family because it is the most important thing that I have seen at drama at Visakha so far, said Herath
Herath pointed out that some of the challenges they have encountered may be finding sponsors and getting people together which is also a pretty big challenge.
Our Drama society is pretty old. Of course we had done Shakespeare throughout the years. We have inter-school house dramas, so we find new faces and recognize the talents. Of course we had done Drama Comp. and we have been champions. We also have a production coming in May. It is all about finding new faces and giving opportunities to kids to get out there and get on stage. Drama is pretty much what all of us do 24/7.When it comes to the competition in the Drama Circuit in Colombo it is very competitive. We see so many new schools coming in. The work ethic is both hard work and fun!, pointed out Herath.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Team work matters
Amaya Fernando President for 2016 felt that the talent is big at Visakha. She pointed out that a lot of their success can be attributed to the fact that they are very close to each other.
I think doing Drama benefits you in so many ways, because first of all it gives you that exposure, it exposes you to a lot of different people and you can overcome your stage fright and you become much more comfortable in performing to an audience and when you do Drama you enter into this circle of people that are really special. Getting to know those people is one of the most important things, because it is a family. That is there in every school not just ours. When you do drama together automatically you become a family. Team work and that love that you see in a cast is the most important thing, explained Fernando.
Fernando took us back through history, citing many milestones in their journey. Actually the girls all admitted that they love to do anything that is different.
I think there are a lot of talented girls in school, because every time we do a production we see so many new girls coming in from all grades. The girls are quite talented, so it is all about recognizing their talents and bringing them into drama. Candid was the first official drama production done solely through the drama club. We got students from Grade 4 onwards to take part in it. It was on June 28 and 29 at the Lionel Wendt. We had a pretty good crowd as well. It was an important milestone for the society as it was the first drama done through the society. We only got outside help to do backstage and directing. Through the OGA we have also done productions before, detailed Fernando.
There was this one instance where they did a dark comedy for Drama Comp in 2015. It was called 4am. Then also did Titus Andronicus a tragedy for Shakespeare and became runners up in 2015.
Last year in 2016 we did Romeo and Juliet for Shakespeare, but we did it in a different way. Because instead of focusing on the love story of Romeo and Juliet, we focused on the friendship of Romeo, Benvolio and Mercutio. It was a play about friendship and what those three friends went through in the course of that love story. It was pretty different and the judges and audience also saw that difference. Last year (2016) was pretty special because we won every award that there was. We won Best Supporting Actress, Best Actress and Best Stage Craft. And we also won the competition, pointed out Fernando
When it comes to balancing my studies and practices, it is not easy because I am taking on someone elses role and being that character. So it is really hard to focus on anything else, because we have practices all the time but even though we spend one or two months on a play, and we focus completely on that, our girls at the end of the day always focus on their exams and get through and we have never got any complaints or anything. We find a way to balance it somehow, shared Fernando
Fernando also felt that Drama at Visakha has grown over the years so much. After their victory at 2013 the enthusiasm has definitely grown.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A winning team!
Hasini Jayawardena spoke about how the girls attempted a very adult play and accomplished it with flying colors. She is also a great help to the team.
4am is a play written by Jonathan Dorf. It was a play about things that are very taboo in society. Things people do not talk about much. There were sections in the drama  one was about an abused child, one was about a girl who wanted more attention, there was another one about a girl who was dealing with issues. The common thing they all had was they were all awake at 4 am in the morning and feeling very lonely and very alone in their situations. We won that competition actually  Drama Comp. 2015.

JCT Oil Bank earns Rs 77 mn  profit in 2016, up 113%
Jaya Container Terminals JCT Oil Bank has enhanced its profit by 113% in relation to 2015, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said. This company had earned a profit of Rs 36 million in 2015. It had earned a profit of Rs 77 million in 2016. It has reduced the selling cost from Rs 96 million to Rs 92 million and administrating costs from Rs 64 million to Rs 55 million.
Ranatunga said the primary business of the Jaya Container Terminal Limited is the storing of fuel supplied for vessels and to supply fuel needed by the companies which provide fuel for vessels in the sea. This company comprises of 13 fuel tanks that could store, HFO 380, HFO 180 and MGO fuel categories. The total capacity of these tanks is 35000 MT.
Preparation of effective management plans by giving the priority to protect the institution has paved way to these accomplishments, Minister Ranatunga said. Employees could protect institutions by earning profits for the government.I am thankful to you about this victory you have accomplished. When these institutions earn profits, there will be no need to sell them.You didnt ask for difficult provisions.
Your requests were reasonable. Hence hardworking employees should be protected. Trade Unions of this institution have gone beyond the party politics and they have unified to protect this institution. That is what government expects from you. I need to develop these institutions by working hard. When we achieve that development then we could say there is no need to sell these institutions and we are earning profits. When institutions do not earn profits then short sighted people around the government try to sell these assets. As a leader who is against the policy of selling state owned assets, as a leader who protect the government assets, contribution you gave to enhance the profit of this institution is a great support to me, Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
The business plan of the shipping oil laboratory to be constructed was hand over to Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.

Juventus hold firm to knock out Barcelona
Barcelona: A distraught Neymar left the field in tears as Juventus held Barcelona to a 0-0 draw at the Camp Nou on Wednesday to reach the Champions League semi-finals 3-0 on aggregate.
Barca had overcome a 4-0 first-leg deficit against Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16 with a dramatic 6-1 win back on home soil.
But Juventus showed why they boast the best defensive record in the competition as Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar were blunted as the Italians gained revenge for their defeat in the 2015 Champions League final.
"To not concede a goal in two games against Barcelona says a lot about the tactical level of the team," said Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri.
"They had more chances in Turin than they did tonight. The team defended very solidly tonight."
Juventus join holders Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and Monaco in Friday's semi-final draw.
"We tried with all our might, but we couldn't find the route to goal," said Barca coach Luis Enrique.
"We played a very poor first half in Turin and that has cost us dearly. I will remember what happened in the first half there."
Straight from kick-off the visitors seemed determined to learn from the French champions' mistakes.
Allegri's men pressed high to prevent Barca dominating possession and enjoyed the better of the early chances.
Gonzalo Higuain volleyed over from the edge of the area before only a brilliant challenge from Gerard Pique prevented Juan Cuadrado's cross providing Higuain with a tap in.
Barca had to wait 19 minutes for their first clear sight of goal as they intricately worked the ball around a packed Juventus box before Messi fired inches wide. Messi then stung Gianluigi Buffon's palms for the first time on the half-hour mark.
"Overall they were the better team and deserved to go through," Pique told BeIN Sports Spain.
"Little-by-little we started to create chances, but they built a mountain."
At the other end, Higuain threatened again when he just couldn't get enough power on Miralem Pjanic's dinked cross to beat Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
Neymar had been Barca's hero in a remarkable finish with two goals and an assist in the final minutes against PSG.
Yet, he found it far harder up against friend and former Barca teammate Dani Alves and his frustrations at a perceived lack of protection from referee Bjorn Kuipers spilled over as he was booked just before half-time. Juventus also had the first big chance of the second half as Cuadrado fired across Ter Stegen but wide of the far post. Ter Stegen was then forced to turn behind another driven effort from the Colombian.
Messi was being forced to come deep in search of possession, but he briefly had Juventus hearts in mouths with a low effort that was deflected fractionally wide.
Enrique forlornly turned to Paco Alcacer from the bench as the hosts played with four forwards for the final half hour.
Messi had another big chance after a rare Buffon handling error from a corner, but unfortunately for Barca it fell on his right foot and the Argentine fired well over. - AFP

Both driver and pillion rider, Easwar Rao and Mohan Rao, fell off the lorry.
Thinking that they were dead, the lorry driver slowed the vehicle and jumped from it and ran away.
The vehicle, without its driver, later rammed into the roadside dhaba, where the four persons were waiting for a bus, said Anil Kumar. -Agencies

Malaysian HC rejects request to transfer Sri Lankan envoys assault case
Malaysian High Court yesterday dismissed the governments application to transfer a criminal trial involving a Sri Lankan envoy from the Sepang court to Kuala Lumpur on security grounds.
Free Malaysia reported that Justice Nordin Hassan has said the grounds raised in the application pertained to law and order.
The applicant and the witness could complain to the trial judge and law enforcement agency if they are unhappy about a crowd outside the Sepang court, he said.
Nordin said the same crowd could be in Kuala Lumpur if the trial venue were to be shifted.
This is not a good reason to transfer the case from Sepang, he said. Last September, three men were charged with rioting and assaulting ambassador Ibrahim Sahib Ansar at the KLIA airport.
He unprecedented application was filed in January by the public prosecutor, with Ibrahim filing an affidavit in support of moving the court.
The application was made under Section 417 (d) of the Criminal Procedure Code for the High Court to grant an order for the general convenience of a witness.
Ibrahim said he believed that his safety was not guaranteed if he were to attend the trial in the Sepang Sessions Court as witness because large groups of Tamils had gathered there during the last two case managements.
He said he was still traumatized by the brutal attack on him at KLIA, a public area which should have tight security measures. I fear for my safety and security if the trial is to be continued in Sepang, he said in the affidavit, adding that he had lodged a police report to express his concern.
He said he felt safer to have the trial heard in Kuala Lumpur as security measures there were tighter and better.
Ibrahim said Tamil groups had attempted to harm the staff of the Sri Lankan High Commission and a former prime minister at a Buddhist temple during his visit to Malaysia.
Lawyer M Manoharan, who is appearing for the accused  A Kalaimughilan, V Balamurugan and V Ragunathan  said the case would be mentioned before the trial judge on May 3.
We will officially inform the judge of todays ruling to fix the trial dates, he said.

## Title: Meethotamulla and its aftermath
## Supertitle:

## Date: Friday, April 21, 2017 - 01:00
Meethotamulla and its aftermath
Joint Opposition parliament group leader Dinesh Gunawardena has requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya to summon an emergency session of parliament. The Speaker, on his part, says parliament can be summoned only at the instance of the Prime Minister. What parliament can achieve at this stage is indeed a moot point unless the JO is planning to use a parliament debate on Meethotamulla to attack the government and blame it for the tragedy.
A sample of what form a parliament debate would take was shown by Gunawardena himself when he told a media briefing on Wednesday that the government ought to be ashamed for offering a mere Rs. 100,000 as compensation on behalf of a victim. This, after Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake having assured that the sum mentioned by the MP was only an insurance payment and that full compensation would follow.
Anyway, the damage has been done and how a parliament debate is going to help the Meethotamulla victims is difficult to fathom. On the contrary, a slanging match over the whole affair will only increase the ire of an already incensed general public who attribute the tragedy to the negligence of politicians of all hues.
This, at a time the country witnessed the dignified presence of our national cricketers led by skipper Rangana Herath at the tragedy site, offering solace and material comfort to the victims. Hopefully this gesture on the part of our cricketers would spur an avalanche of largesse from others, particularly the corporate sector. It must be remembered that the Meethotamulla garbage mountain includes a not inconsiderable portion of factory waste and discards in addition to the garbage and litter from wealthy homes in the city. Hence they are all obliged to come to the assistance of the victims in whatever form.
Meanwhile garbage trucks keep roaming the streets of Colombo and elsewhere, aimlessly, trying to locate dumping grounds while still others are driven from pillar to post after being chased away by irate residents who would not want another Meethotamulla in their backyards. The blame game is also continuing apace, the latest addition to the babel of voices is that of Gamini Lokuge who was nowhere near the Meethotamulla garbage site following the tragedy, although as an MP representing the Colombo District he would have been a recipient of the manapeys of the Meethotamulla residents. Like fellow Colombo District MP Udaya Gammanpila he has emerged from the shadows to take aim at the government. The former UNP stalwart, now an abject follower of Mahinda Rajapaksa, is repeating the claim of Gammanpila that had Gota's Puttalam project being implemented the tragedy could have been averted.
He also reiterates Gammanpila's claim that funds were allocated in the 2015 budget for Gota's project but a change in government put paid to the matter. Lokuge who is based in an electorate where the garbage problem is most acute should have been among the first to urge the former Defence Secretary to get on with the project at the very outset and not in 2015 when the garbage problem had got out of hand. Credit is also sought to be given to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa for conditioning the military for such arduous tasks as the rescue mission in Meethotamulla when it is common knowledge that even in the pre-war days the army was well geared to handle emergency operations, as witnessed in the cyclone devastation in the East in 1977.
A parliament debate, called for by Dinesh G., no doubt will also centre on the merits of Gotabhaya, curtsy JO speakers, and on what might have been, had his projects and plans for the city being implemented, never mind if the Puttalam project was pigeon holed and funds allocated only in 2015.
Be that as it may, the directive issued by President Maithripala Sirisena for speedy resettlement of the victims of the Meethotamulla tragedy is to be welcomed. Steps have been taken to provide homes to 98 families as an initial measure and a programme has already been drawn up in this connection. It is not just homes and accommodation, the victims should be given assistance to rebuild their devastated lives. As television showed there are a large number of children among the displaced, whose education is going to suffer. Among these children there are those who had lost one or both parents. A special programme should be devised to seek out these children, lest they be left to their own devises and be exploited by unsavoury elements. The Ministry of Women and Childcare should move in the matter. It is laudable indeed that our national cricketers who visited the scene had taken cognizance of this factor and have pledged to support the children to rebuild their future. Others too should join in without leaving everything in the hands of the government. Private Television channels who give wide publicity to their charitable projects can take the lead in this connection. No one will begrudge them for the publicity they shower on themselves by assisting the victims of the Meethotamulla tragedy.

Meethotamulla garbage crisis: Tissa proposes simple remedies
Many foolish ideas being presented to solve the Meethotamulla garbage issue such as transporting garbage by train when many simple scientific solutions are available, Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
He was addressing a press conference at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday.
The LSSP leader said trains have to operate day and night a year or more to transport over 20 million tonnes of garbage from Meethotamulla to Puttalam. We have many no cost scientific solutions to solve the issue. I can show how I have implemented such a solution to remove the garbage at my Colombo residence, he said.
Covering garbage with a hard polythene sheet and allowing it to decompose and become natural fertiliser is one solution. The money earned from selling this fertiliser can be given to the Meethotamulla people. The Bloemendhal garbage mountain naturally underwent this procedure. Today that location is covered with grass and plants and has converted to a natural mountain, he said.
A total of 100 tonnes of garbage can generate one megawatt of electricity. The The Yatiyanthota Pradeshiya Sabha commenced fertiliser production scheme using garbage under my guidance and now it is functional. The solution presented by the late Bernard Soysa and I 22 years ago was defeated by MPs who had been bought by some private companies which earned from garbage and it is still the same, he said.

Microsoft rallies finance leaders  to embrace future
Microsoft held a symposium for C-level finance executives at Cinnamon Grand Colombo, recently.
The event which featured keynote speakers and a live demo-revealed how Microsoft Power BI, an interactive data visualiser that utilizes predictive- analytics and machine learning, could help CFOs and their finance teams grapple the future. From cloud computing and robotics to analytics and automation, a new class of digital disruptors is transforming how business gets done, said Tharshini Perera, Group Finance Manager, Microsoft. At Microsoft, we're expecting these disruptors to have a big impact on the way Sri Lankan finance will progress. Therefore, we find it important to create this two-way dialogue now to help our partners achieve more.
Corporations that thrive in this rapidly changing world contrast greatly to the organizations that once dominated the early 1990s. Today, finance leaders give businesses a new competitive edge, and are responsible for delivering business insights across their organizations. Furthermore, the drive toward efficiency will demand more from CFOs and their teams.
Vikram Bakhshi, Senior Finance Director for the Asia Pacific Region tied Microsoft's mission to engage and empower people to optimize and transform operations. Financial departments across many industries are undergoing unprecedented disruption. Technologies like predictive analytics and machine learning are entering the finance mainstream, allowing finance teams to contribute to the business conversation with real-time data driven insights, he said.
Conducting a demo on Microsoft's Power BI tool, Gael McLennan, Finance Director Microsoft South East Asia said, Data is pervasive and action is elusive. The Power BI dashboard is a cloud-based business analytics service built for non-technical users. With just a browser-any browser-or a Power BI mobile app, finance workers can keep tabs on their business through live operational dashboards. It just takes a moment to load up a dashboard and start interacting with your data.
Using data-driven insights to help make quick and more informed decisions is increasingly important; Power BI can help finance teams deeply explore their business data with interactive visual reports that drill down into their most important information-and enrich it with additional data sources. Reports are built on datasets, while visuals can be pinned to dashboards. In turn, these dashboard visuals are linked back to the reports. The software incorporates predictive-analytics, machine learning, and a view related content feature provides a quick and efficient way to view and jump between those connections. The interface is uncomplicated and constructing a sample dashboard takes little over five minutes.
The event concluded with an interactive session for the CFOs and wider audience, initiating a conversation over the benefits Power BI dashboards have across multiple industries to how CFOs can prepare themselves given the future of data-analytics.

Nadal among favourites for French Open, says Arantxa
NEW DELHI: Nine-time winner Rafael Nadal remains among the favourites for this years French Open -- but Roger Federer is stronger than ever at 35, according to Spanish great Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.
Sanchez-Vicario said Nadals fitness would be the key at the seasons second Grand Slam, starting next month, after he missed last years French Open during an injury-hit 2016. However, the 30-year-old Spaniard recovered to stun many observers by reaching Januarys Australian Open final against Federer, where he lost in five sets to his long-time rival. Well, definitely. I think that he is one of the favourites to win again at Roland Garros, Sanchez-Vicario, a four-time Grand Slam-winner, said at this weeks Rendezvous Roland Garros event in New Delhi.
Hope he is not injured. So thats the most important (thing) for him in order to compete well again, added the 45-year-old. Nadal, currently ranked seventh, has lost three times to Federer this year after this months Miami Open final and their clash in the last 16 at Indian Wells.
Sanchez-Vicario was full of praise for the evergreen Swiss, who won a record-extending 18th Grand Slam title at the Australian Open.
He has become stronger. His backhand is powerful and he is winning many points there. And he has that mentality in the game, he is a champion, she said of Federer.
Its great for sports, and for tennis, to see him doing so well again and winning Grand Slams at that age. He is a legend and a champion.
Sanchez-Vicario, who was just 17 when she beat German great Steffi Graf to win the 1989 French Open, added that she was open to the idea of joining the likes of Ivan Lendl, Boris Becker and Amelie Mauresmo as one of tenniss celebrity coaches. AFP

National Policy on Standards for Adventure Activities
Adventure Tourism and Adventure Training is fast becoming a popular industry. The Central Project Management Unit of the Ministry of National Policy and Economic Affairs, in furtherance of their Tourism development initiative and the Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Minsters Office, together with the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Board, recently convened a meeting of service providers and regulators in the sector.
The idea was to promote self-regulation. There are International Standards for all adventure activities, and the need was for Sri Lankan Standards to be developed, on par with the international Standards. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Standards is already involved in this task. They were present and agreed to involve all stakeholders in this process. The meeting decided on some important follow up steps.
The SLTDB will set up a website on which all locations at which Adventure Activities are provided by service providers will be listed. The Sri Lanka Navy will convene a meeting of all water based adventure service providers to assess the present status. For example, the wreckage of the HMS Hermes off Batticoloa. Similarly, the Sri Lanka Air Force will coordinate air based adventure activities through a meeting of stake holders. In the same way, the Special Forces of the Army will focus on land based adventure.
On the emergency communication and search and rescue, the TRC will coordinate with telecommunication
service providers and health and emergency first responders, to have a common number to call in case of a crisis. The PDO of PMO will work with the PMs Committee of Vocational Training to develop a National Standard Qualification for Adventure Trainers. The Sri Lanka Insurance Board will look into the insurance cover aspect of adventure providers and participants.
In the future, the consensus view of the meeting, was that Adventure Tourism and Training will be increasing in popularity exponentially, and that the industry service providers should prepare for this and have best practice safety standards available.

Over 50 thalassemia patients had contracted hepatitis-C virus through blood transfusion they received from state hospitals despite the claim that the virus has already been eliminated from Sri Lanka.
The Health Ministry has already been informed about the issue but still there is no response, Ragama Teaching Hospital Director Dr. Roy Perera said.
Addressing a programme held at Kadawatha yesterday, he said 20 thalassemia patients from Ragama and another 32 from Anuradhapura contracted the hepatitis-C virus, which is transmitted through blood. Every month, about two Hepatitis patients with hepatitis-C virus are being detected, he said.

Pakistan PM survives Panama Papers ruling
Pakistan's Supreme Court has ruled there is insufficient evidence of corruption to remove Nawaz Sharif from the role of Prime Minister.
It instead ordered a further investigation into money transfers.
Questions arose over the business dealings of Sharif's family when three of his children were linked to offshore accounts in the Panama Papers leaks in 2015.
Sharif and his family have denied any wrongdoing.
They have dismissed the claims as politically motivated.
The case has made headlines in recent months amid predictions it could determine the future of PM Sharif.
Stocks rose following the highly anticipated decision on Thursday.
The Supreme Court agreed to investigate Mr Sharif's offshore wealth late last year after opposition leader Imran Khan threatened street protests.
The focus of the probe was on the funds used to purchase property in London using offshore companies.
Sharif's daughter Maryam, tipped as a future political star, and his sons Hasan and Hussein are implicated in the allegations.
Sharif says the wealth was acquired legally. But his critics have suggested offshore companies were used to launder illegally-obtained wealth or avoid taxes.
The Supreme Court's five-member bench was split on Thursday, with two judges voting against the prime minister but three choosing instead to order a further probe.
Sharif's party, the Pakistan Muslim League - Nawaz (PML-N), hailed the decision and his daughter Maryam tweeted: "Praise and glory be to Allah alone."

Patali wants garbage management made an essential service
Garbage management should be considered an essential service and brought under a Central Garbage Management Authority, placing garbage management across the country under same without any delay, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
He also said that the people should get rid of the popular slogan of we dont need garbage of Colombo and join together to solve the issue considering the matter as a national issue.
He made these observations at a press conference held at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry auditorium at Battaramulla.
Various governments had attempted to solve this issue at various times but certain politicians attempted make petty political gains by organizing protests and urging the people to do so, Minister Ranawaka said. Those protests against the scientific garbage management attempts led to this tragedy at Meethotamulla. So we should not allow anybody to abuse democracy in the country to disrupt these constructive projects .
He also said that there is talk that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had a plan to dump garbage at Aruwakkaru in Puttlam. He added however that had been halted as the Wild Life Department was against it. The message was conveyed to us by the Central Environment Authority. The Minister however conceded that it was a commendable task as it was a scientific approach.
He also said that certain institutions level allegations that the authorities asked for bribes to allow them to engage in garbage management. However we have granted the projects under open tenders and they have been disqualified due to various reasons including the inadequacy of technology Minister Ranawaka said. I clearly state that there had been no corruption in our ministry.
Minister Ranawaka further stated that instructions were sought for garbage management through an expert committee. In 2015 international tenders were called for the garbage management in Karadiyana and Gampaha. 119 local institutions and 11 international institution applied, Minister Ranawaka said. So we selected four investors and three investors for Karadiyana and Gampaha respectively after a technical evaluation.
Those who were not selected say that they were asked bribes. This is the nature of the country.
He also said that that Meethotamulla land was handed over to Western Povince in 2012. The CMC dumped garbage there and later the Western Province was given another land in Muthurajawela.
With this our ministrys responsibility is over Minister Ranawaka said. The responsibility of Garbage disposal came within the ambit of provincil councils.
Megapolis and Western Development deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna also participated at the Press Conference.

Peoples lands should be released: TULF
Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) General Secretary V. Anandasangaree in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday reiterated their demand that the lands belonging to the people in the Northern and Easter Provinces be released.
He said delay in releasing the lands may prove detrimental and even led to a demand asking the Tamil MPs of these districts to quit Parliament.
The full text of the letter:
The Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) reiterates its demand for the release of lands belonging to various individuals, at different places in the Districts of Jaffna, Mannar, Killinochchi, Vanni, and at various places in the Eastern Province as well. The TULF is very frankly of the opinion that continuing to hold these lands cannot under any circumstances be justified. For any human being living in any part of the world, land is too precious to give up. It is such a sensitive issue, I wish to warn the Government Your Excellency, that the only way to solve this problem is to promptly and unconditionally quit all such lands .
I wish to quote from a press release of the TULF dated July 2, 2010, signed by me as the Secretary General. TULF. The first paragraph itself says I am frankly of the opinion that the opening of an Army Camp at Mullaithevu as a fore-runner and the decision of the Government to build permanent houses for the Army are ill-timed, counterproductive and will very soon prove disastrous. I am not that foolish as to stir up a hornets nest by protesting against these moves. Whatever I do and say are always with patriotic feelings.
My sincere advice is that the Government should forthwith stop opening any more new camps in Vanni, close down the one already opened and also abandon the idea of constructing permanent houses in the North and the East for the use of the Army. The Government should understand and appreciate my thinking and give credibility to my suggestions.
The fears expressed by me at that time now stands proved. Your predecessor did not take my advice but I hope you will. The movement to demand the release of lands, is now fast gaining ground. Added to this, even the Catholic clergy is getting worried over the new developments. Hence the Government should not loose time to concede the demands of the people. In a peaceful situation, so much of Army Camps are not at all necessary and all Camps other than those that were in existence before the war, should be closed down immediately, without causing humiliation to the people who think that they are fighting a holy war.
Your Excellency, any further delay may prove detrimental and may even end up with the demand, that the Tamil MPs of these districts should quit Parliament.

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said the Yahapalana government will give priority to rescuing the people from the evils of tobacco, alcohol and drugs.
What the previous government did under the Mathata Thitha was to grant liquor licenses to their cronies. When these cronies ventured out for various other illegal business connected to the liquor trade, the political leadership even threatened the Police to secure their release, the minister said.
He was addressing a ceremony to commission the service centre to fulfil the requirements of the people living in Muwanwewa, Lunugamwehera.
The public servants in the Muwanwewa area will be able to serve the people without any hassle through this newly commissioned service centre.
Loads of narcotics were brought to the country by containers during the former regime. Today our government nabs such narcotic containers. The Customs is also rendering a yeoman service island-wide to tackle the narcotics. We have stopped giving liquor licences through politicians. The responsibility of the
politicians is not giving liquor licences but rather serving the villagers, he said.

From Putney to Bhairava Kanda
The Ceaseless Chatter of Demons, Ashok Ferreys new novel published by Penguin, India, has an impressive quote from Alexander McCall Smith on the front cover: A wonderful writer. This lovely, surprising book will enchant and amuse. It is, quite simply, a triumph. This is a handsome compliment, coming from such a renowned writer. Of the three novels written by Ferrey to date, this arguably is his best. Enchanting and amusing it is from the word go. When it comes to eloquent phrasing and poignant satire, Ferrey (one of Sri Lankas leading fiction writers) is in a class of his own. Whether he is writing short stories or novels, to produce irresistible page-turners is his unique gift, largely due to his flair for effortless storytelling. A hallmark of his writing is his incandescent wit.
All his books published to date (novels and short-stories) are very entertaining. They may not tackle complex social or psychological issues, but they do take a swipe at the false values and double standards espoused by privileged segments of Sri Lankan society, especially the westernized, upper-middle class. Here is an example (from Demons) of his breezy writing style and humorous prose: I had thick curly black hair and flat features. But I had lustrous, velvety skin, even if it too was rather black for my mothers refined Sanskritized tastes. My one great feature was my smile  it truly lit up the darkness I seemed to carry around with me  and it was surprisingly popular with the girls. Naturally, I smiled an awful lot. As expected, the only woman who was immune to this smile was my mother.
Demons, though cosmopolitan in scope, is imbued with a strong local flavor. The imagery created through figurative language and witty dialogue is very Sri Lankan. The plot is woven round a series of events that occur after a young man from Bhairava Kanda (the one with lustrous, velvety skin) is packed off to Oxford University by his strong-minded mother, who is obsessed with the lost treasures of the erstwhile Kandyan Kingdom, not to mention various rituals associated with Bhairava Kanda sub-culture, such as demonry and necromancy. The sprawling old house she lives in (Mahadewala Walauwa) is a symbol of wealth and prestige. Legend has it that Bhairava Kanda (gnome mountain) is where hundreds of young virgins were sacrificed to Bhairava, the four-headed Demon King, during the days of the Nayakkar Kings, the last rulers of Kandy.
While at Oxford he falls for the lovely young daughter of an Italian-American millionaire, a few years older than himself. A heady one-night stand produces an unexpected result: a shotgun marriage to which he has difficulty adjusting, so much so that he quits Oxford and goes to live with her in Putney, a district in south-west London. He tries to become a writer but fails to finish the book.
It is when the couple goes to Bhairava Kanda on holiday (late 2004) that various complications arise. The plot takes an unexpected turn as the spotlight shifts from the protagonist to the humble housemaid who, having endured a great deal of humiliation and abuse, decides to turn tables on the status quo. The manner in which she hijacks the story is an interesting feature of the plot.
The protagonist (Sonny), his overbearing mother (Clarice), his enigmatic wife (Luisa), and the lowly housemaid (Sita) comprise the core of the dramatis personae. The macho garden boy (Pandu), who displays an insatiable lust for Sita, adds an interesting dimension to the plot. So does the drag queen  a demon who emerges from the netherworld to check out the scene in Bhairava Kanda, where it is believed the ogre still resides (though he doesnt howl for blood any more). All three novels by Ferrey are of the cross-cultural variety, but in Demons we see his gift for poetic imagery and artistic expression undergoing a complete metamorphosis from chrysalis to Lepidoptera. What we now see is a new kind of Ferrey blending luculent prose with expansive vocabulary to create colors, tones and textures every bit as delicate and enchanting as those of a Jezebel or a Sylphina Angel.
Through skillful use of a variety of literary devices such as metaphors, similes, idioms, symbolism, flashbacks and alternative viewpoints (omniscient and restrictive), the writer creates a sharp divide between modern, post-industrial British society and traditional, pre-industrial Sri Lankan society, with focus on the Bhairava Kanda sub-culture, symbolized by Clarices Weltanschauung  an infernal blend of prejudice, bigotry, superstition, greed and ruthless pragmatism. Even the drag queen is impressed by it.
Let us pause for a moment to recall Robert Knox, who provides a fascinating account of Kandyan culture in his book, An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon. Knox was of course an Englishman and his seminal work was published in 1681. This was more than a hundred years before the British conquest of Ceylon commenced. In Demons one can find examples of how the colonial powers (British, Dutch, Portuguese) collectively altered the course of Sri Lankan history.
Like Ferreys other two novels, this one also relies heavily on sub-text to capture the various shades and nuances of Sri Lankan culture. In this regard the author toys with the concept of morality, especially in the context of Bhairava Kanda sub-culture, where the lines between good and evil are blurred. A peculiar feature of the novel is that the person who impacts the reader most is a minor character (Sita) and not the protagonist. If there is a central theme, it is embedded somewhere in the book and is not easily accessible. But all in all, Demons is a winner, an excellent read.

Recruiting Nuts for life changing travel experiences
Juliet Coombe discovers why Jetwing Tailor Made & Jetwing Travels lead the market with over four decades of incredible and very special travel experiences.
What seemed like a great idea the night before, whilst learning to mix Big J Cocktails at Jetwing J after an amazing day doing feasible experiences, looked up at the palm trees early morning looked distinctly unattractive at6am in the morning. I am on the palm fringed beach of Jetwing Beach Hotel, Negombo, looking at a terrifying prospect of climbing a 28 foot coconut tree and walking the line from one tree to another so I could really understand first hand the challenges of making treacle. There was only one way up to the world of the coconut tapper and it was via old looking coir ropes with long dead coconut shells tied into them as footholds, surrounded by Hitchcock like crows eager to make my acquaintance, though not necessarily for positive reasons, I felt. Furthermore, I could see a large group of hornets flying around Nimal, the seasoned tapper, going about his business and when I asked Hemantha, the hotel naturalist, about them, fully expecting a response along the lines of dont worry they are the non-stinging variety or its okay if you ignore them they wont sting you, I instead got yes, his brother had to go to hospital in a critical condition a few days ago when he tried to clear them away at night with a torch. At that point, I have no idea why, I decided to carry on and give it a go, and put my foot on the first shell.
Making treacle
I regretted my bravado immediately and wondered how I might escape the impending humiliation until I was told it would be easier without my sandals. Sure enough my feet turned out to be more monkey-like than I realised and I had real confidence in the grip they afforded me so struck out somewhat gingerly for the treetop. The rope was rough but the shells seemed strong enough so I persevered, occasionally hugging the tree for dear life as I went. By the time I reached the top, sweating profusely with a crow squawking almost on my shoulder but feeling triumphant, I then had to negotiate huge coconut fronds to get onto the rope joining the tree to another. I was reminded at this point of my youth where using all four limbs to climb a tree wasnt so difficult and got my confidence back again until going along the tightrope it did that thing of increasing circular motion making me think it would soon upend me and have me falling on my neck. Push the ropes wide apart, my worried fellow tapper finally broke his silence. Sure enough this worked, too, and although rough on the feet I made my way across to the next tree where Nimal joined me. The hornets seemed to have lost interest at this stage but the crows were definitely not letting me get away with what they saw as their free drinks so squawked away to no avail. Nimal showed me how to remove, by twisting, the pots that were full of the raw liquid, at this stage smelling a tiny bit boozy, but not for making arak in this case but for making treacle for the hotel, as they had been filled with a small bit of the trees bark to prevent fermentation. He also took his Crocodile Dundee knife and hacked away a little at the stump to stimulate, further, the secreting of this soon to be delicious accompaniment to yogurt/curd or ice cream. Unusually, my descent, was much easier than the ascent and this was the end of the tapping  there was a large and a medium sized pot for the mornings work. Indrani, Nimal able assistant for collecting the juices in the pots and the keeper of the fire for boiling the raw juice, told me that they get RS/500 per large pot, and that one gallon of raw juice gets boiled down to one bottle of treacle, worth RS/75.
A wonderful lifestyle
I have been a tapper for 43 years since I was 12 years old, Nimal claims, having learnt the skill from a Tamil from southern India, but his son has other ideas for his future, sadly, so Nimal is looking to recruit his apprentice from the likes of me if possible, so send in your CVs if you want an amazing job in an amazing place like Jetwing Beach and Blue, but be prepared to wait a few years as he has no intention of stepping down, or should I say stepping off, any time soon and seems very proud of his job. He is very happy that I had a go, saying I feel you have added value to the experience. I was then taken across the road, past the fine all-weather Jetwing Beach tennis court, through the amazing oasis that is the Jetwing organic vegetable garden where I tried fresh cucumbers, to where the treacle is made in vast woks that require five hours of boiling before the sticky dark brown nectar of the gods is produced. The same cinnamon wood fires are also used to burn clean the inside of the collecting pots, which takes about ten minutes. The boiling process also kills off any residual fermentation that may have occurred in the collected liquid. Indrani and Nimal were clearly very dedicated to their jobs and had a wonderful lifestyle so for any westerners or Sri Lankans brave enough to take on this challenge, who have not yet found themselves an exciting enough career this could be the opening you have been waiting for  who knows Nimal might need relief soon for further hornet attacks or if he gets fed up with the haranguing of the crows, or you may simply want to learn all about it first or play the long game. Which ever experience you decide on when booking a trip with Jetwing Travels, remember Jetwing Hotels have developed together with them a unique range of travel experiences in their stunning portfolio of 33 hotels, that will simply blow you away with the incredible team of characters that make every trip an unforgettable one.

Recycling contaminates plastic toys with toxic chemicals: IPEN
A new global survey finds that recycling plastics containing toxic flame retardant chemicals found in electronic waste results in contamination of the world's best selling toy along with other children's products.
The contaminants can damage the nervous system and reduce intellectual capacity of Children.
The study was conducted by IPEN, a global civil society network, Arnika, an environmental organisation based in the Czech Republic, and CEJ, Center for Environmental Justice.
The toxic chemicals, OctaBDE, DecaBDE, and HBCD, are used in the plastic casings of electronic products and if they are not removed, they are carried into new products when the plastic is recycled.
The survey of products from 26 countries including Sri Lanka, found that 90 percent of the samples contained OctaBDE or DecaBDE. Nearly half of them contained HBCD,
In Sri Lanka, CEJ purchased five Rubik's cube-like toys and send them for analysis to the Czech Republic.
Two samples were chosen for laboratory tests. The analysis found that both samples contained OctaBDE and DecaBDE at elevated concentrations. These chemicals are persistent and known to harm the reproductive system and disrupt hormone systems adversely impacting intelligence, attention, learning and memory.
The study emerges just a few days before the global conference of the parties to the Stockholm Convention will decide whether to continue allowing the recycling of materials containing OctaBDE and possibly make a new recycling exemption for DecaBDE. The treaty's expert committee has warned against the practice.

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that a retired judge is to sit in a committee to probe incidents that led to the Meethotamulla tragedy. The President also said that if necessary, legal action would be contemplated depending on the recommendation of the judge.
He stressed that there should not be a repetition in the future. He said although the government will pay compensation to the next of kin, it cannot give them back the price of the lives lost in the tragedy.
I have had three rounds of talks to resolve this issue before the tragedy took place. We discussed this issue at Cabinet level, he said
The President added that the tug of war between the institutions handling the issue are solely responsible for the tragedy. We know that people make money out of garbage trucks going in and going out of the Meethotamulla garbage dump by way of extortion, he said
President Sirisena added that he has directed the Army engineers and Urban Development Authority to get involved in removing the garbage dump.
Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said a new garbage holding facility has been set up at Kirindiwela which could extract water out of garbage and recycle them.
He added that waste management is a must which should start from home. He said that the government will establish sanitary landfills to solve this issue.

Retiring duo Misbah, Khan lead Pakistan against Windies
Kingston: West Indies and Pakistan get a three-Test series underway on Friday at Sabina Park in Jamaica with both teams struggling in the midst of challenging transition periods.
Despite victories in both the T20 and One-Day International series earlier in the tour, the tourists have shaped up as a far more vulnerable outfit in the traditional format of the game.
The home side, who remain mired in the lower reaches of the international rankings, look set to make further alterations to their line-up in the quest for a consistent winning formula.
Pakistan topped the Test rankings last September following their drawn series in England.
But a slump of six consecutive defeats, ironically initiated by the West Indies in Sharjah five-and-a-half months ago at the end of an otherwise disastrous campaign for the Caribbean team, has seen them slip to fifth and increased public pressure on Misbah ul Haq to step down as captain.
After much speculation Misbah has announced that this series will be his last before retiring from the international game.
And only last week fellow veteran Younis Khan, Pakistans most prolific run-scorer in Test history, also revealed that the West Indies tour will be his last in national colours.
Khan goes into the match needing just 23 more runs to become the first Pakistani to amass 10,000 runs in Tests, and while the milestone will be of immense personal significance, of even greater concern to the visiting team is completing their first-ever Test series triumph in the West Indies by the time the final Test concludes in Dominica in mid-May.
Sabina Parks 50th Test since the first was staged in 1930 against England is likely to be an intriguing affair given Pakistans less than flattering display in their lone warm-up match ahead of the series where they were outplayed in a drawn three-day fixture by a West Indies Board Presidents XI in the western Jamaican town of Trelawny.
Three of the representative team who starred with the bat against the tourists  Kieran Powell and the uncapped pair of Vishaul Singh and Shimron Hetmyer  were named in the West Indies squad of 13 for the opening Test although it is anticipated that Hetmyer, captain of the victorious team at last years Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh, and fast-medium bowler Miguel Cummins will be omitted from the final eleven.
Kraigg Brathwaite, the mainstay at the top of the batting order over the past three years, goes into the match still basking in the glow of his historic effort in the Sharjah Test victory when his unbeaten innings of 142 and 60 guided the West Indies to their first Test win over Pakistan away from home in 26 years.
Notwithstanding his outstanding entry to senior international cricket during the limited-over leg of the tour, Pakistans Shadab Khan may not make his Test debut alongside established wrist-spinner Yasir Shah unless the pitch looks extremely dry before the toss on Friday morning.
Wahab Riaz and Mohammad Aamir are set to spearhead their attack but with Hasan Ali nursing an injury sustained in the warm-up match, there is speculation that 27-year-old fast bowler Mohammad Abbas will earn his first Test cap in support of the senior men.
Teams (probable): West Indies  Jason Holder (capt), Kraigg Brathwaite, Kieran Powell, Shai Hope, Vishaul Singh, Jermaine Blackwood, Shane Dowrich, Roston Chase, Devendra Bishoo, Alzarri Joseph, Shannon Gabriel.
Pakistan  Misbah ul Haq (capt), Azhar Ali, Ahmed Shehzad, Babar Azam, Younis Khan, Asad Shafiq, Sarfraz Ahmed, Mohammad Aamir, Wahab Riaz, Yasir Shah, Mohammad Abbas.

Right of Reply: 1977-2017: A Political Revue of 18.4.2017
I am not surprised at all to read an article penned by Sarath de Alwis, attempting in his usual style to cast doubts on the veracity of the information found on my most recent publication - The P.M.s Biography.
In 2015, when my book, The Great November Revolution was released, de Alwis was quick to devote half a page to virtually do the same thing as he has done on the Daily News (C.D.N.) on Tuesday (April 18). He has on many occasions in his columns made references to me with an ulterior motive. It is very obvious he has a personal axe to grind. Since, Mr Ameresekere on the CDN of 20/4/2017 has adequately dealt with the issues raised by de Alwis, I believe there is no necessity to respond to Mr de Alwis's comments.
The material for the book he refers to was researched over a period of two years, many people were interviewed and their opinions were also cross checked where possible, since some of those events took place before I was born or when I was at school. He also claims Ranil Wickremesinghe deserves a balanced biography while making several contradictions. I urge Mr de Alwis to put his foot where it rightly belongs and publish a balanced biography of the P.M. of his own, like what I did at my cost, without attempting to pass judgement on the work of others.

The Government today decided to pay a monthly allowance of Rs 50,000 to each family that has been evacuated from the high-risk area around Meethotamulla garbage dump, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary S. S. Miyanawala said.
He said about 150-160 families would receive the monthly allowance for a period of three months. The allowance is provided for the evacuated families to rent a house until permanent houses are provided.
The families who were given permanent houses in the housing complexes coming under the Urban Development Authority would not be entitled to this payment. 
Houses were handed over to members of sixty families whose houses were completely damaged at the Meethotamulla tragedy earlier today based on a decision taken at a Progress Review Meeting held on provision for relief to the victims.
The decision was reached under the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at a Progress Review Meeting held this morning.

Rukmini Kodagoda Junior Match Play Golf: Akash meets Vinod in Gold div. final today
In the Gold division the finalist made the cut to battle it out for the coveted Rukmini Kodgoda trophy and the Sri Lanka Junior Match Play Champion title.
In this division age group boys 18 yrs and below, Vinod Weerasinghe overcame stiff competition from Armand Flamer Caldera to win the game 3/1. Both golfers showed much promise and being long off the tees they battled it out with good play and ultimately Vinod won on the putts.
In the final, past champion Weerasinghe is looking to go for his second win back to back.
T. Akash had a narrow 1 up win over Vihan de Alwis, after Vihan being 3-up on the turn but careless play cost him the match. In the final top seed T. Akash will take on last years winner Weerasinghe.

SAITM to be broad-based: Board of Governors to be appointed
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that the Government will put an end to the SAITM monopoly and appoint a board of governors in line with other such institutions in the world. The President also said that SAITM will be broad-based and will be listed on the Stock Market shortly.
President Sirsena said that the government devised this system after taking into consideration certain suggestions made by the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF). The students pointed out that SAITM belonged to one person, and it cannot have a common approach regarding certain issues.
Accordingly, the Governent has had discussions with Dr.Neville Fernando to introduce more reforms, the President added.
The Medical Council has announced minimum qualification for medical education. The Government has a task of recognizing non State educational institutions which include medicine,President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena added that at least 7585 per cent of students go overseas annually for higher education.
We can only accommodate 25,000 students in state universities, the President added.
The President added that in the past, it was only the rich who sent their children to foreign countries for higher education. But now most parents sell their belongings to provide a higher education for their children, President Sirisena added.
Under the circumstance, we have to recognise non state education for Sri Lankans. SAITM could impart medical education for the children in this country, the President said.
At the same time we gurantee the rights of all university students. We will increase the number of scholarships granted to them, President Sirisena said.
The President added that fees of private education institutions will be amended to provide more children higher education opportunities.

Serena expecting baby this year
LOS ANGELES: Serena Williams is expecting a baby this year her spokesperson confirmed Wednesday, hours after the tennis great hinted at the news in a Snapchat post.
I'm happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this Fall, Los Angeles-based publicist Kelly Bush Novak said in a statement emailed to AFP.
While Williams won't play again this year, she looks forward to returning in 2018, Bush Novak said.
Williams' Snapchat post, quickly highlighted in US media, showed the 35-year-old in a yellow swimsuit that revealed an apparent baby bump. But the post was quickly taken down, lending an air of mystery to its meaning.
The GOAT herself @serenawilliams took to Snapchat to announce she's 20 weeks pregnant! Congratulations Serena! the US Tennis Association, organizers of the US Open which Williams has won six times tweeted, using the acronym for Greatest Of All Time.
But the Women's Tennis Association deleted a congratulatory tweet and acknowledged in a statement they had not had confirmation of the news.
It was hours before they could tweet: It's official! @SerenaWilliams and @AlexisOhanian are expecting a baby this fall. In December, Williams announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, first sharing that news on the Reddit social media site.
If Williams is 20 weeks into her pregnancy, that means she was already expecting when she won her record-setting 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January -- where she beat her elder sister Venus in the final.
For fans the announcement underscored Williams' superwoman status.
Williams hasn't played since her Australian Open triumph, which saw her surpass Steffi Graf for the most Grand Slam singles titles in the Open Era.
Only Australian Margaret Court has won more, capturing 24. The last of those came in 1973 -- the year after Court gave birth to a son.
Williams cited a knee injury in pulling out of tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami in March.
Her inactivity saw her drop to second in the world rankings.
But she is set to regain the top spot from Germany's Angelique Kerber on Monday when the latest standings are published.
Comeback credentials
Williams wouldn't be the first top women's player to return to competition after having a baby, but she would be the oldest. Belgium's Kim Clijsters came out of retirement at the age of 26 after having a child and won three Grand Slam titles.
Former world number one Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, 27, won the Indian Wells and Miami titles in March of last year before missing the rest of the season as she awaited the birth of her first child in December.
Since the birth of son Leo, Azarenka has returned to training and plans to return to competition at the WTA tournament in Stanford, California, in July.
But Williams has proved herself capable of returning to top form after long absences from competition.
She was sidelined for almost 12 months after her 2010 Wimbledon victory, returning from a potentially life threatening pulmonary embolism. Over the past year Williams' schedule has included few tournaments outside the Grand Slams.
Her appearance at the Australian Open tuneup event in Auckland, New Zealand, marked her first tournament since a semi-final exit at Flushing Meadows last September. - AFP

Serendib Flour Mills brings sustainability to operations
Serendib Flour Mills (SFML) recently embarked on a long-term sustainability drive to minimize the companys impact on the planet, whilst improving the overall management of water and energy use at its milling facility.
Serendib Flour Mills CEO Kevin OLeary said: We are trying to reduce our long-term greenhouse gas emissions and ensure that we use water and energy in the most efficient manner. Whilst a more environmentally-friendly operation enables us to tread lightly on the planet, it also enables us to reduce our operational costs and minimise the unnecessary wastage of important natural resources.
SFML recently hired Control Union, an independent international assurance and certification body to conduct a full environmental assessment of the companys operations and milling facility. Based on the findings of the study, measures are now being put in place to reduce the companys total carbon emissions by 8% in 2017. A variety of smart energy solutions are also being discussed and will be rolled out throughout SFML over the course of the next five years.
SFML delivered its first tanker to silo operation to Diana Biscuits and is planning to offer the storage option to other customers as well. Instead of constantly transporting large volumes of flour between the milling facility and customer factories, the tanker stores 20 tonnes of flour at a customers factory site itself, and eliminates additional transport costs altogether.
Explaining the benefits of using new storage solutions such as the silo, Kevin OLeary said: The use of this innovative storing option saves a great deal of fuel and energy, however it is also more hygienic as the flour has zero human contact and travels directly from SFML to the silo and finally to a customers factory site itself. The silo uses robust FIFO practises, is more efficient, it reduces unloading times as well as transportation and labour costs  enabling SFML and our customers to reduce costs and reduce the impact on the planet.
Green leadership: Commenting on how SFML is spearheading its sustainability initiatives, Kevin OLeary said: We recently appointed an energy management team- a diverse group of professionals from across the organization, who come together on a monthly basis to plan out all activities, analyse our reports and form our energy policies, in consultation with Control Union. The team also engages with an energy expert to share and learn more about best practises and new ideas. He further added: We also are trying to increase employee awareness on key issues such as water conservation, recycling and the need to save energy, weve deployed a series on internal messages throughout the organization such as regular e-mail reminders and notices, we will also come together more as a team to celebrate key environmental hallmark days. Additionally, we will be investing in conducting ongoing training sessions, to ensure that proper environmental practises become a core part of even day-to-day office activities.

Sims backs Wolves to rediscover their bite
LONDON: Warrington may have suffered a woeful start to the Super League season but Ashton Sims sees no reason why they cant make up for lost time.
Former Fiji international Sims felt he was playing some of his best rugby during Warringtons early-season woes, which saw the 2016 Super League Grand Finalists lose their first six league games.
Remarkably, the Wolves only win before April was against Brisbane Broncos in the World Club Series, but they have since turned things around - with three successive victories catapulting them to within two points of the top eight ahead of Saturdays clash with Wakefield.
Forward Sims believes their struggles were blown out of proportion before they finally got off the mark with a 22-22 draw against Hull FC, and is confident normal service will be resumed as they continue to repair the damage caused by their slow start.
My form felt quite good earlier this season but it was hard to say you are playing well when you are losing games, said Sims.
But Ive been really enjoying my time here so its good to be back to winning ways and we can push on now.
We had a good second half against Hull which was important for us to build on.
It had been a frustrating season for us because in those first few weeks the only game we won wasnt in the Super League, it was against the Broncos.
We showed some good signs of how we should be playing but it was just unfortunate that it wasnt in Super League.
This weekends Super League action kicks off on Friday as struggling Widnes host St Helens, while there are two matches on Sunday as Hull FC host Castleford and Wigan face Catalans Dragons.
Hull returned to form at just the right time with a 24-10 win against Leigh last week - with Tonga centre Mahe Fonua back to his destructive best after a pair of high-profile errors this month.
The 24-year-old has been targeted after spilling the ball out of the backfield, but head coach Lee Radford warned Castleford he is back to his best.
Mahes issues over the last month have been well-documented, said Radford. Rightly, opposing sides are now making an extra little play at the ball every time he carries it.
So for him to respond from that initial error against Leigh was big. This weekend also sees Super League sides enter the Challenge Cup for the first time this season, with Salford, Leeds, Leigh and Huddersfield all in action.
Huddersfield head coach Rick Stone is desperate to see their eight-match winless streak disappear against Swinton Lions - and he believes a bit of luck would make all the difference. - AFP

The tourism industry is booming in the country despite the slight set back for Sri Lankan Airlines in the first four months of this year. However we see that the trend is back on its upward momentum these last three months and there has been a 3% growth in within these last three months against last year, he said.
PATA is a non-profit organisation responsible for the development of travel in the Asia Pacific region. It consists of 95 government, state and city tourist bodies, 29 international airlines, airports and cruise liners and 63 educational institutions. Tourism Promotion Bureau officials said the event will help increasing Sri Lankas prominence in the tourism industry.
Amaratunge told the Daily News that through the summit, the the international community will be able to see what the country has to offer. We want to make Sri Lanka a popular destination.The country as it is has many perks as it is. We have the finest diversity, best beaches, trained staff in the hospitality industry and so much more. We are confident that we will be able to surpass our target 2.5 million with the exposure this event will provide us, he said.

A tribute to Bertie Wijesinha
This is a belated but worthy tribute to Sri Lankas only survivor of World War 11 cricket, who passed away last week. I refer to R B Bertie Wijesinha who was a coaching institution with a distinguished record of several national players produced by him.
I first met Bertie in 1946 immediately after World War 11 concluded. He had a whistle stop coaching stint at Nalanda College, Colombo which I attended. It came to light later that Bertie found travel between his residence and Nalanda too arduous and time consuming.
The next confrontation was at the then SSC cricket ground, at Victoria Park, Colombo 7 where the Nelum Pokuna is presently located. It was when the Combined Colleges XI opposed the mighty SSC in a two-day encounter. I performed with a degree of credit and was astounded when, at the end of the days play, eminent seniors such as Col F C de Saram, Lucien de Zoysa and Bertie sounded me about joining the SSC. As invitations from such illustrious individuals were uncommon I sought time to discuss matters with my parents.
The next morning was sensational! The eminent Oxford Blue Col F C de Saram had entrusted SSCs roley-poley, mustachioed bar keeper Sarah to hand deliver the Application Form to my home. Thus commenced my partnership with Bertie.
Bertie, it must be admitted, was no Gary Sobers as an all-rounder. Nor was he a Mahadevan Sathasivam with the willow. But he was always accommodating when asked to clarify various cricketing issues.
His coaching contributions to youth were wide and immeasurable. Technique and theory were well balanced, as was in evidence during the hey days of the Wettimuny brothers. Maintaining the spirit of the gentlemens game was uppermost in his mind and discipline was of paramount importance.
Berties attitude towards the game and its participants ran parallel to that of Nalandas Prefect of Games T Kandaswamy who reigned supreme for nearly three decades.
Lastly and thankfully Bertie enjoyed domestic bliss for well over fifty years with his wife Dorothy, a Beauty Queen of the fifties.
When I visited Bertie a few years ago, in the company of another Thomian stalwart, Mevan Pieris, I was taken aback to see a once brilliant cover fielder, who formed a near impenetrable barrier in the covers with Hector Perera, H I Fernando, Channa Gunasekera and, when not keeping behind the stumps, with Mahes Rodrigo, struggling to maintain his balance when walking.
It also brought to mind his half-century against the Pakistani quickies Munawar Ali Khan, Khan Mohamed, U Chippa, Fazal Mahmoud and Maqsood Ahamed in 1950 at the Karachi Cricket Stadium. How ironical, I wondered.
May the turf weigh lightly on him!

Trinco port, FTA among topics for discussion during Modi visit
The contract for the construction of the Trincomalee Port and the conclusion of the Free Trade Agreement are among some of the bilateral agreement that will visited during Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka, the New India Express reported.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected in Sri Lanka for the inauguration of the UN Vesak Day celebrations from May 12  14.
It will be Prime Minister Modis second visit to Sri Lanka since 2014.
Earlier in 2015, he had inaugurated the reconstructed Northern Province Railway line that linked Jaffna with Colombo. The rail line is one of the few developmental projects undertaken by the Indian government in post-conflict Sri Lanka, where China has made deeper inroads.
The Indian Government has been undertaking large number of development projects in Sri Lanka for rehabilitation and resettlement of conflict-affected and internally displaced people in Tamil-majority Northern and Eastern provinces.
Indias total development aid is more than USD 2.6 billion. As per the Government of Sri Lankas statistics, more than 880,000 Internally Displaced People have been resettled in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, as of end-August 2016, with around 43,600 people left to be resettled.
The flagship project is the US$ 270 million Indian Housing Project for constructing 46,000 houses in the Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka, which are nearing completion, and 4000 houses in the Central and Uva Provinces.

UN Vesak academic conference 2017: Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable Peace
The teaching of the Buddha was addressed to many groups of people in society with varied goals and ambitions. While some of his followers were keen on attaining the ultimate goal of ending suffering by renouncing all worldly ties, there were others, perhaps, who constituted the majority, who wished to live a happy, contented and fulfilling life meeting their all social obligations.
The Buddha taught them how to live a good family and social life enjoying what they earned from righteous means. In these teachings we find the Buddha addressing issues that would usually come under the modern concept of justice, in particular, the concept of social justice.
Insights found mainly in the Basket of Discipline (Vinaya Pitaka) testify to the existence among Buddhists of a sophisticated tradition of juriprudence and natural justice.
What the Buddha taught on social issues in general and what he taught on justice, in both social and legal sense, need to be highlighted, so that the teachings of the Buddha may become an antidote to the social ills prevalent in society today.
Inner and outer peace
In Buddhism, peace, intimately associated with justice, is understood in a broader sense to include both inner and outer peace, and peace as absence of conflict and peace as a positive quality of individual and of society. In order to ensure that peace is sustained it is necessary that individuals have inner peace developed with mindfulness.
This, however, does not mean that Buddhism neglects social and structural aspects of securing peace among large entities such as societies, nations and finally, the entire world. In the context of the present day world, it is crucial that peace and understanding among religions or among the followers of religions be given priority. It is the duty of the Buddhists to elucidate the Buddha's insights on social justice and peace and also elaborate on the vast historical experiences of the Buddhist societies in South, Southeast, and East Asia where Buddhism has been practiced by millions of people for over two millennia.
Economic well-being of all Buddhist communities
What lies behind the Buddhist concern for justice and peace is the idea of well-being of all sentient beings within which includes economic well-being without which the whole concept of well-being will lose its significance.
Today there is a need to go beyond academic discussions of economics, and explore possibilities of promoting economic well-being of all Buddhist communities by all Buddhist communities.
The perennial Buddhist prayer May all beings be happy (sabbe satta bhavantu sukhisatta) exemplifies the Buddhist aspiration for the well-being of all beings, transcending all barriers and limitations, has remained the goal of Buddhism from the day of its inception for the celebration of which the UN Day of Vesak has been dedicated.
Finally in this era of sophisticated mass communication it is very important that Buddhists review the current state of their modes of communication and the institutes and individuals engaged in communication. In the arena of communication and use of mass media Buddhists need to share their experiences with one another and explore ways and means to make the maximum use of the modern technological innovations.
Keeping this broad vision in perspective the conference will focus on the following four themes:
(I) Social and natural justice inthe Buddhist perspective
(II) Inter-religious understandingof common future for the humankind
(III) Buddhist forum for economicsand promotion of cultural tourism
(IV) International Buddhist media network
The conference will devote an entire session for papers dealing with multiple aspects of social justice and a round-table symposium will be held for each of the other themes.
The paper presenters and resource persons for the proposed themes will be invited. All participants of UN Vesak 2017 celebrations are encouraged to take part in sessions of their choice and contribute to the discussion and action plans that will ensue.

Unfair to blame present govt. for Meethotamulla tragedy: Malwatte Prelate
Since the Meethotamulla Garbage problem has been dragging on for nearly 30 years, it is unfair to point the accusing finger at the present government with regard to the recent tragedy that occurred there, Most. Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter said. The Mahanayake Thera said only two years, have passed since the present government came to power and these two years are inadequate to resolve such a longstanding problem of this nature.
The Chief Prelate expressed these sentiments delivering an Anusasana when Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday.
The Malwatte Mahanayake Thera said as a result of the Meethotamulla tragedy, people elsewhere protested against the dumping of garbage from Colombo in their areas,since they had no trust in pledges held out by politicians.
At this moment of grief, everyone should join hands to provide succor to the affected people without making utterances for pure political gain, the Malwatte Chief Prelate said. Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala said that even though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa made various statements for political gain, the project planned by his regime to take Colombos waste to Puttalam to fill limestone quarries was extremely unsuccessful and had to be abandoned. Now they were making various unfounded statements to wash their hands off the Meethotamulla problem.
Sumathipala said the Puttalam project was only a colourful pipe dream which was impractical. Nearly 8,000 tons of waste was collected from the Colombo urban areas. One goods wagon in a train could accommodate only 40 tons and one could imagine what a lot of wagons would be needed to transport such a load of garbage daily, he said.
Even a grade two student would not put forward such a weak plan or programme, the Deputy Speaker added.
The need of the hour was the establishment of a national institution to handle garbage management. The Government, Provincial Councils and Local Government institutions should join hands to work out a national policy and programme in this direction, Sumathipala said.
Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Sri Lanka Cricket National Projects Secretary Sujeewa Godaliyadda were also present on the occasion.

As such there was no need to jump the gun as the Council would automatically stand dissolved after the lapse of the five year term.

Every designer who has shown at CFW in last 10 or so years have been impacted by our programmes. As I have personally spent time with them at some point or the other, and every year a new lot comes and current lot becomes not-so-new. Every season is carefully planned with the development of fashion design industry at its base. We know where we are going this year and next. Nothing is done adhoc, everything is part of a plan. Bigger goals ahead, stated Founder and President of Colombo Fashion Week, Ajai Vir Singh at the event.

Harry is a real hero
A compliment from sister-in-law:
The Duchess of Cambridge has praised her 'brilliant' brother-in-law Prince Harry for speaking out about his mental health struggles - as she hinted at battling with 'mixed emotions' after becoming a mother for the first time.Kate, 35, was speaking to Jamie Maloy, headteacher of Viking Primary School in west London, during a reception for London Marathon runners at Kensington Palace on Wednesday.
Mr Maloy lavished praised on the prince, saying: 'What I love is your brother-in-law talking the other day, because that's just ignited it.
'Everyone's talking about mental health now because someone who is so famous and so much in the public eye has actually turned around and said something hit me hard  the death of a close loved one. And I think people have gone "good on you, because you could have never mentioned that."'
When he told Kate how Harry was 'a real hero to a lot of people', she replied: 'Absolutely. He's been brilliant.'
The Duchess of Cambridge hosted the athletes running for Heads Together, the mental health campaign she launched last year alongside the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, at her Kensington Palace home on Wednesday afternoon
The Duchess was hosting a group of athletes running for Heads Together on Wednesday, the mental health campaign she launched last year alongside the Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry which has been chosen as the official charity for this year's race.
The princess also met DJ Neev Spencer who suffered post natal depression after the birth of her daughter, Genevieve, now nine months.
Kate told her: 'Nothing can prepare you for motherhood - especially the first time round, the mixed emotions.'
The Duchess has spoken candidly in the past about suffering from a 'lack of confidence' as a first-time parent, calling motherhood a 'huge challenge'.
Today, the mother-of-two opted for an uncharacteristically dressed-down look with a 220 striped top from Italian label Luisa Spagnoli, skinny jeans and her trusty Superga trainers as she welcomed the runners to her London residence - a far cry from her ultra-polished look during her last public appearance on Easter Sunday. - Daily Mail

Influenced by Scandinavian architecture, the Colombo City Centre residences focus on providing an aesthetically-pleasing, neo-classical environment that meets the diverse needs of the 21st century lifestyle.
The spacious interior design of the CCC apartments is devised to help residents de-stress, relax, and unwind. High white ceilings, homogeneous porcelain tile flooring, full glass elevation, and sophisticated colour palettes figure prominently in the space, allowing for a greater intake of natural light and providing the perfect canvas for prospective homeowners to define their living space.

Additionally, nearly every room within the apartment, especially the bathroom, will host unobstructed, panoramic views of the awe-inspiring emerald-green Beira Lake, the exquisite Indian Ocean coastline, and the brilliant city skyline at night.

Action on garbage despite protests
As protests erupt over the choice of location to dump garbage from Colombo, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said the government would no longer indulge in discussions or criticism on the subject of garbage but will take swift action, despite the agitations.
We have identified a few areas to set up a sanitary landfill for Colombos waste. This would take up to a month to be ready and in the meantime, we are looking to Karadiyana and Dompe as a temporary solution,he said. The Minister was addressing a media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday. Given the numerous protests by residents of Karadiyana and Dompe, Minister Yapa said the government would not be immediately informing the people of the new locations, he said. We are not looking to create another Bloemendhal or Meethotumulla.Open dumps are not what we will create. The government will prepare sanitary landfills with the aid of the latest technology,Minister Yapa said.
The Minister who was one time Minister of Environment explained that the issue of garbage could not be resolved due to opposition from various politicians and other pressure groups every time a proposal was brought to deal with it. Western Provincial Council Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya reiterated the Ministers stance and explained that it was the failure to create the Meepe sanitary landfill site which resulted in the Meethotumulla tragedy.
There have been 25 mountains of garbage which have been created around the Western Province because we could not implement Meepe,Devapriya said.
The Chief Minister also complained that successive programmes brought forward by the Provincial Council failed due to authorities in the central government not granting approval on time. I have asked the Cabinet, the President and the Prime Minister to let us do our work. We are very interested in such programmes.All that is needed is for them to clear the path for us, he said. He added that in the next three years, if the projects of turning garbage into electricity are implemented in Muthurajawela and Karadiyana, the Western province will have no garbage issue to speak of.

Australia to ship dairy heifers to Sri Lanka
West Australian cattle exporter 'Wellard' will soon be looking for dairy heifers from Australia to fill contracts it has in Sri Lanka.
The company has sourced 2,000 pregnant Friesian-Jersey cross heifers from New Zealand as the first shipment to fill a 20,000 head contract.
Wellard Breeding and Dairy General Manager Colin Webb said the NZ shipment was timed to coincide with the completion of cattle handling and dairies being built in Sri Lanka.
Our next consignment will be sourced from Australia, and we will be seeking similar categories of heifers once we start our Australian procurement program, Webb said.
Wellard said the live cattle export program would help Sri Lanka produce fresh milk for the local market rather than rely on expensive, imported milk powder.
The company is also supplying nutrition, herd management, animal welfare, veterinary and milk quality advice as part of the contract.

Bird obsession
A man has been dubbed the Ornimator for filling his entire home with 60,000 worth of bizarre ornaments.
Eccentric Lawrence Cobbold, 43, has filled his home, three sheds and a garage with 20,000 items of bric-a-brac - and he doesnt plan to stop there. The obsessive collector - who started his hobby 30 years ago - even moved to a new house so he could have more room his ever expanding collection. And he even has to cook and clean at his parents home because he has no room in his own place.
It just took off, said Lawrence, who works as a warehouse attendant.
A couple of my work mates have seen the collection. They know roughly how much Ive got but when they see it its more than they thought. Id say that the total value of my items are between 50,000 to 60,000.
In total, Lawrence has around 14,000 thimbles, 2,000 paperweights, 1,000 fridge magnets and about 300 plates. He has also collected hundreds of pictures, mugs and jigsaws, all connecting in some way to birds .
Lawrence, of Plymouth, Devon, says he is known in most of the local charity shops, with some stores even holding items back for him that theyll know hell like. His collections have taken over every room of the house - so he spends most of his time at his parents place.
He said he has started collecting smaller items, such as thimbles and paperweights, to fit around his bigger pieces.
Ive got a feather duster, but a lot of the pieces are too delicate to clean that way, he said.
The best way to clean them is to blow the dust off them and then hoover it up.
Lawrences dad Tony used to keep budgies, canaries, cockatoos and finches and thinks that could be where his sons interest with birds started. He has also been organising car boot sales for over 20 years.
Whenever we see a bird, thimble or paperweight, well always buy it, said Tony, 65.
We dont just go out and buy one, well buy 100 or 200 at a time. We buy everything. The good with the bad.
Lawrence previously owned a two-bedroom house before he moved into his father Tonys old three-bedroom property so he had more room. Tony even sold Lawrence his garage so that he had extra space to store his mammoth stash. But he still has to do most things at his parents house.
Tony said: He cant prepare any meals, or do any washing at his house, he has to do everything at ours.
He used to sleep at ours as well and just have the house to show his ornaments but hes managed to fit a bed into one of the rooms now. He cant do any cooking because he doesnt want the grease or dirt to damage his collection. He does have a kettle though so he can make a cup of tea or coffee.
Single Lawrence Cobbold said one of his favourite items in his collection is a 6ft4in lamp in the shape of a parrot which he bought for 200 from a shop in Newton Abbott. He said his best bargains tend to be bulk bought collections of thimbles which work out at 5p or 10p a piece. His oddest item is a paper weight with a jellyfish inside which he bought for 20 from a shop in Paignton.
Asked why he collected items he said today: I dont know really. It started off with bird ornaments and then it went to thimbles and then it went to paper weights. I dont know why I do it. I just do. I always have. I like to talk to people in the charity shops, so its a social thing too. I had a budgie when I was little so that started off the birds. Im going to keep collecting the thimbles and the paperweights because they are smaller, because Im trying to downsize.

A bond built through learning  Australian alumni in Sri Lanka
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson in a press release highlighting the cooperation that exist between Australia and Sri Lanka said theyll be launching the Australia-Sri Lanka Alumni (ASLA) to add a new dimension to bilateral education relationship.
Following are excerpts of the press release:
The links between Australia and Sri Lanka in education go right back to mid-last century. More than a thousand young Sri Lankans have received scholarships to study in Australia under the Colombo Plan, and more recently through the Australia Awards.
Alongside those scholarships there has been tremendous growth in the number of Sri Lankan students choosing to study in Australian institutions under their own steam. Indeed right at this moment there are over 7500 Sri Lankan students studying in Australia.
That makes education one of the core pillars of our people-to-people relationship  perhaps even more significant than the healthy rivalry between our cricket teams. As I go around Colombo and more broadly in Sri Lanka, Im struck by how many talented, motivated, energised people I meet who are graduates of Australian institutions. From cabinet ministers, to hoteliers, senior bureaucrats, businesspeople, scientists, caf owners and doctors. These are people who have chosen to invest in their futures, and entrusted Australian universities to help them do so.
We know international education is a big financial commitment for families, and one that shapes the lives of students in a very profound way. But it pays off. When they return to Sri Lanka these students contribute actively to the growth and welfare of this country. They also return with a real appreciation for Australia as a country and Australians as a people. And they find ingenious ways to sustain the links theyve built, through business, through culture, through lasting friendships and many other ways. But sadly, not many of them choose to support the Wallabies in rugby.
We dont want the relationship with Australia to end once students return to Sri Lanka. We want to find ways to stay connected with students who experienced our country and to support them in their careers. Thats why Ive established a new body  the Australia-Sri Lanka Alumni (ASLA). We want ASLA to provide a platform for Sri Lankan alumni of Australian universities to connect, through valuable professional networking opportunities.
The very first ASLA event will be held at the Movenpick Hotel in Colombo on April 26. I will be leading a discussion on the future ingredients for a successful and sustainable tourism industry in Sri Lanka. Ill be joined by the Deputy Chair of Tourism Australia, Andrew Fairley, who can impart some of his knowledge of Australias vibrant tourism sector  now our largest services export industry. And well be graced by two illustrious Sri Lankan alumni who are leading Sri Lankas preparation for the tourism boom.
We know that education is the pathway to success in the century ahead. And that many of us are now committed to lifetime learning as the global economy changes.
We hope ASLA can make a contribution by translating international education experiences into practical networking opportunities that boost your career back home, and we can have an interesting and fun time along the way.

Central Authority for solid waste management

President Maithripala Sirisena at a progress review meeting this morning ordered a speedy solution to solid waste management.
The President furthered ordered necessary arrangements are made to vest power with a Central Authority in regard to this.
The garbage issue has reached a peak with over 700 MT of garbage collected daily and no place to dump it.
Having identified several other temporary locations, the government was met with stiff resistance from residents who protested the dumping of garbage in their areas.

Changing trashing habits
Heaps of garbage lay piled up at every nook and corner of Colombo, letting stray dogs drag and feed on it and as the week wears on, garbage from Colombo has nowhere to go.
Colombo Municipal Council trucks in the meantime, were seen wandering the city looking for dumping grounds amidst strong protests by residents surrounding the landfill sites of Dompe and Karadiyana, calling for authorities to not dump Colombo Garbage close to their homes. Protesters on Wednesday alleged that the government was trying to turn their city into another Meethotamulla.
The general public however also have a part to play in managing their own waste and thus far have failed to realize their responsibility towards creating change.
Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, Sociologist, Nimal Premathilake said there was no need to wait for huge projects to commence reducing waste as Provincial Councils and Urban Councils could on their own, take small initiatives to bring about great change.
Garbage is a resource and that can be used very effectively. Our people are so used to just dumping all waste into one bag and throwing it. Firstly, the mentality of the people has to be changed to make a difference in the whole process, he said.
Premathilake who was the former Chief Public Health Inspector of Balangoda Urban Council recalled his experiences at Balangoda, which too went through a garbage crisis. There was a huge garbage problem in Balangoda as well and empty lands were used to dump garbage. In 2000 however, the administration of the Balangoda urban council realized the challenges pertaining to garbage and introduced a well organized waste management project, he said.
At a time when all the garbage was being dumped within the town of Balangoda itself, Premathilake said the Urban Council reached out to the people and educated them on the importance of making their own compost.
Following that initiative we told the people that they can sell their waste and they were given a small value for it. There are many technical issues when waste is taken for recycling. The garbage collector was trained to collect the waste and segregate it in proper manner, he added.
Premathilake further explained that another small initiative that was taken in Balangoda was to introduce the same system to Schools.
The students were taught and trained to keep the environment clean. They learnt about the compost making process and they contributed a lot to making the project a success. Creating awareness among a thousand students would lead to cleanliness in thousand homes, he said.
He said the mixed composting method could be easily implemented and that it would not consume much space and added that nearly 80 percent of the problem would be solved if a proper method was implemented to manage degradable garbage.
Premathilake however, also noted that the biggest challenge in Colombo was managing the garbage generated by a floating population.
In Meethotamulla, all waste has been dumped together and that is not an effective measure, he said.
He further said that he is currently taking measures with the support of the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development to introduce mixed compost methods in all condominium flats in Colombo.
Premathilake pointed out that there are nearly 150 recycling companies; both small and large scale industries but they were not being used fruitfully.
Currently, waste has become a social problem as well as an environmental problem. A small step will make greater changes in the whole system, he said.
Bhagya Seneviratne - Bambalapitiya
I live in an apartment in Bambalapitiya and I dont have a garden to make natural compost and neither do I have the space to keep a compost bin. I think that, this is the situation for many people living in Colombo, not enough space do all that. Provincial Councils have a vast role to play in this regard.
We segregate the waste but the CMC workers put it all together in their trucks. What is the purpose of making it mandatory for all people to segregate the garbage if they are not collecting it properly
Fathima Zuhair - Nawala
When I called the Kotte Municipal Council they said they will collect it on Wednesday but the garbage keeps piling up and no one has come to collect it.
We also try our best to separate the garbage and dispose of it but the Municipal Council truck just puts it together.
We need some effort from the Municipal Councils as well to reduce the garbage.
They say they have compost bins for all residents but they are yet to give it to us.
Pathum Wickremasinghe - Dehiwala
The garbage issue has become the talk of the town now. The public blames the government for the whole calamity. Even though the government took responsibility for the incident, they should realize that the tragedy occurred because of their inability to introduce a proper waste management system.
Meanwhile, the public also have a responsibility to reduce waste.
I saw people protesting not to put Colombo Garbage in their residential area.
We cannot blame them for doing so. Meethotamulla garbage dump was initiated as a temporary project, but it continued for years despite several objections from the public. Therefore, it is fair from their end.
A. Goonetilleke - Colpetty
Soon, Meethotamulla will be forgotten, except by those affected by the tragedy. By now, most of us would have thrown the usual brickbats at the Government and authorities and moved on to newer local or global happenings. The Meethotamulla tragedy need not have happened, and need never happen anywhere in this country again if I, an ordinary citizen, accepts responsibility for my part in it and is determined to do my part in the future for the betterment of my country.
My garbage is my responsibility. Even if I pay taxes for garbage collection, I am responsible for the way it is sorted and packed before collection. My garbage has no place in front of my neighbour's house, beside a lamp post, or in the nearest drain. Public roads do not need my bus tickets, and beaches and parks don't need my empty plastic bottles and wrappers.
You and I can practically make a difference by allocating three to five minutes a day to separate biodegradable from non-biodegradable waste. Even children can be taught to dispose of garbage responsibly. Such basic separation at point of source will result in an increase of the lifespan of the final disposal site. The recent tragedy could have been averted if each of us had handled domestic garbage more responsibly.
Try and use biodegradable kitchen waste as compost. Disposable plastic containers work well as pots for plants, collect unsoiled plastic bags and donate them to street vendors and the cost of buying shopping bags for their customers reduces.
Accept the offer of sturdy reusable shopping bags sold by most supermarkets at a nominal price, and use them as much as possible. Leaves or rubbish outside your own garden is not meant to be swept in front of your neighbour's garden and forgotten. Bag it, sort it out and dispose of it.
In addition, consider repairing things before you replace them, if possible. Selfishness and negligence could give rise to another tragedy like the one that hit Meethotamulla. Likewise, responsible action, individually and collectively, will eventually give rise to a cleaner and more disciplined nation.
Vidya Abayagunawardena - Environmentalist
So far Sri Lanka has failed to manage its own garbage for several decades and Meethotamulla was the highlight of this issue. The collapsing of the Meethotamulla garbage mountain cost many lives, injured hundreds and destroyed hundreds of houses. Previous governments and also the current government did not give high priority to finding a lasting solution to the garbage issue in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka produces only 2.3 million tons of waste compared to 45 million in Australia annually, where they recycle waste within the same year. Sri Lanka accumulates waste each year, piles it and dumps it on open dumping sites, open burning and into water bodies. This has created severe health and environmental hazards. Apart from the current amount of waste produced in the Colombo city limits, this will double within a few years time. This is mainly due to the fact that the Port City, new residential apartments, hotels and new businesses will generate more garbage in years to come.
Sri Lanka needs to find an immediate solution to this burning issue without delay, otherwise Sri Lanka will face multiple issues relating to health, environment, socio-economic and political factors. The only solution for Sri Lanka's waste management is to set up proper recycling plants in the country.
Open dumps, burning and filling of water bodies is not the solution for waste management in Sri Lanka any more. Due to some unknown reasons, the setting up of recycling plants is not seen as a solution to Sri Lanka's garbage issue.
People and businesses can separate garbage but there is no proper facility to recycle them. Under these circumstances Sri Lanka will have several garbage mountains collapsing, similar to the Meethotamulla story in years to come.
The Meethotamulla incident was reported by leading mass media around the world and unprecedented publicity was given to this incident. Sri Lanka will become more famous for the collapse of Garbage Mountains rather than the country's achievements in the socio-economic, political and other sectors if the country if it does not address its garbage issue.

Computer issues at CMC Town Hall
Recently I had to visit the Assessors department located in the first floor of the CMC building, Town Hall, to hand over the necessary set of documents in order to get the Certificate of Ownership for my daughters house. After perusing the documents, a female officer gave me a printed paper with some details and a charge of Rs. 585.00 (all inclusive) requesting me to make the payment to the cashier in the ground floor after handing over the receipt.
When I took this document to the cashier, I was directed to a counter in the extreme corner to get a formal invoice (computer generated.) In order to get this invoice, I had to wait for a long time in the queue and I overheard the invoice clerk telling her other colleague in the adjoining cubicle that the computer is taking a long time to process the details fed in and it was also getting stuck.
I had to subsequently take this invoice to the cashier to settle same and get a receipt. Thereafter, I had to go back to the first floor to the Assessors department to hand over the receipt.
This letter is to request the IT department of the CMC to troubleshoot the issues with regard to the above computer so that neither the invoice clerk nor the customers are inconvenienced due to the fault of the computer and the payment procedure is also simplified by the Finance Division to make it time-saving.

Death Sentence..!
It was a day before Earth Day, and in the International Court of Justice, there was a stomping of little feet and raising of childlike voices. The Judge lifted his gavel and brought it down, not once, not twice but a dozen times, but the angry din didnt die down a bit. Order! Order! he said wearily rising from his seat and some calm was restored.
A moment later the sounds became worse. Killers! cried the children in the courtroom, as the long line of defendants were led to their box.
Murderers! shouted the same children, their shrieking shrill voices rising in crescendo.
Destroyers!
Butchers!
Order! Order! said the Judge, as he turned his angry glance at the parents of the children in the defendants box. They were all trying to put on a brave face, but their lawyer knew it was a lost case.
You may start! said the Judge kindly to the lawyer who represented the Children of the World and all the children in the International Courtroom cheered as their young lawyer got up, but the next moment as they looked at the faces of their own parents, they started their angry booing again, waving their little fists at the adults standing with forlorn faces.
Your honor, these men and women in the dock are murderers and killers! shouted the young lawyer.
They are your parents and relatives, said the Judge to the children.
They have desecrated our inheritance! shouted the children some of whom were weeping ceaselessly.
What charges have you against all the accused asked the Judge.
That they, said the lawyer reading from a list, have knowingly misused this their earth they were given to use for a limited period of time, and, have through pollution and waste, emissions and environmental mishandling, made this planet a place unfit for these their children to live in.
What evidence do you have asked the Judge.
Floods!
Unseasonal rains!
Epidemics! shouted children.
Tsunamis! shouted a child from Asia.
Heat waves!
Global warming!
Dried rivers!
Shrinking oceans!
Order, order! shouted the Judge finally, You say that all this has been caused because these people never took care of their planet
Yes your honour!
What do you plead asked the Judge looking at the accused, who stood trembling. Adults all of them in the age group of fifty and above.
We plead guilty your honour!
Guilty of destroying planet Earth leased to you for your lifetimes
Yes your honour!
The Judge turned to the lawyer who represented the children, And what punishment do you seek
Death! shouted all the children, Death! and even as they shouted the Judge heard the sickening sounds of wheezing and coughing from an unhealthy generation.
The Judge looked wearily out of the window, and whispered, The sentence is death. But it is not I who have passed this sentence, but Mother Earth herself.
There was no weeping or crying in the courtroom as the accused were led away..!

Destined to Meet
She traveled from Italy. He from Delhi. Their destination: The University of Cambridge, UK. She was there to learn English, he, to study mechanical engineering. Though they were at the same university, their paths might never have crossed if they had not been at the same restaurant at the same time one memorable day.

Yet, at first, it seemed only Charles Antoni, the Greek restaurant owner, at whose restaurant Rajiv Gandhi first set eyes on her, predicted what would inevitably happen. When he saw the doe-eyed, shy girl from Italy, Rajiv had persuaded Antoni to make room for him to sit next to her, so that he could get to know her a bit more. Antoni had agreed, provided Rajiv paid double for making the arrangement. As Antoni remarked later in a film on Rajiv by Simi Garewal: Rajiv might not have known it at the time, but he, Antoni, knew. I had never seen anybody so much in love. It was like in a book.
The Italian girl who captured Rajiv Gandhis heart so totally was Sonia Maino.
Born on December 9, 1947, in the small village of Orbassano, just outside Turin, Italy, Sonia was raised in a traditional Roman Catholic household, and her parents, Stefano and Paolo, were working class people. Stefano was a building contractor who owned his own medium-sized construction business; Paolo took care of the familys three daughters. When Sonia was eighteen years old, her father sent her to Cambridge, England, to study English. He did not know that his oldest daughters life was about to change forever.
According to Sonia, she fell in love with Rajiv the moment she saw him. The courtship, however, lasted three years, perhaps because Rajiv was from one of the most famous families in India, if not the world.
However, Sonias father was not particularly keen on Sonia marrying Rajiv, not because he did not like Rajiv, but his daughter going to a distant land and culture worried him no end.
Indira Gandhi too had had her own doubts about this union. When Rajiv had introduced Sonia to her when she went to London in 1965 for the Nehru Exhibition, Indira Gandhi felt that Sonia should come to India for a few months to see things for herself before taking the final decision.
Sonia thus waited to complete her 21st birthday in December 1967 and arrived in Delhi in early January 1968. She was put up with the Bachchans at their Willingdon Crescent house, though she spent the day at 1 Safdarjang Road, with the Gandhis. After a week or two, Mrs. Gandhi realized that both were very serious and there was not much point in waiting; their going around would only encourage gossip. Towards the end of January, their engagement took place and the wedding was fixed for February 25th, that same year.
Sonia and Rajiv were married in a simple ceremony; Sonia wore the same pink sari her mother-in-law had worn at her own wedding many years before, woven by Jawaharlal Nehru while he was in prison.
It was an Indian wedding with a difference, simple and yet, gorgeous. The two exchanged garlands, vows and signed the legal papers while the former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and mother of the groom, looked on. Among the invitees were the then President Zakir Hussin and the grooms aunt Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit. As well as Rajivs brother Sanjay Gandhi and Sonias family. Sonias father did not come but her mother, sister, and maternal uncle arrived a day or two before the wedding. A reception was held the next day at Hyderabad House.
The love story continued till the very end. Rajiv would constantly praise his wife in public and call her the most beautiful woman I know. And there seems little doubt that Sonia was the only woman in his life, although he could be charmingly flirtatious with pretty women even in Sonias presence. She would look at him from the corner of her eye in playful reproach.
Once when asked, Baldev Kapoor, the photographer who had been with them ever so many times, if he thought they were in love, said, Oh yes,  and smiled, obviously.
