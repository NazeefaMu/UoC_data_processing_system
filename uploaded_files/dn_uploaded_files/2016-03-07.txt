Four-goal Ronaldo silences Madrid critics in Celta rout

Madrid, Sunday: Cristiano Ronaldo silenced his critics with four goals in Real Madrids 7-1 mauling of Celta Vigo on Saturday after being jeered by certain sections of the home support.
Ronaldo wheeled away in celebration with hand cupped to his ear after smashing home Madrids second after Pepe had headed Zinedine Zidanes men in front before half-time.
The three-time World Player of the Year added three more to surpass Telmo Zarra as the second-highest scorer in La Liga history with 252 goals in just 228 appearances.
And there was further good news for Real as Gareth Bale scored Madrids seventh on his first appearance after six weeks out with a calf injury.
Victory moved Real back to within nine points of leaders Barcelona, who travel to Eibar on Sunday.
You know Cristiano, he is capable of scoring four goals and there are very few people capable of doing that. That is why he is unique, said Zidane. It is part of football that the fans whistle now and then.
They are demanding fans, but at the same time they know their players well and always want more. That is good to help us improve and do more.
There was little evidence that Ronaldo or Real were about to burst into life during a quiet first-half played out in front of a frustrated home crowd after last weekends 1-0 defeat to Atletico in the Madrid derby.
Iago Aspas had a huge chance to put Celta in front when he headed against the bar before Keylor Navas smothered his follow-up effort from point-blank range.
Ronaldo didnt make his presence felt until 20 minutes in when his fierce strike from distance was beaten to safety by Ruben Blanco. The Celta keeper also denied Isco and Casemiro, but the visitors were struggling to deal with cross balls and Pepe powered home the opener five minutes before the break from Iscos cross.
Ronaldo had controversially claimed Real would be top of the league if the rest of his teammates matched his exacting standards after the Atletico game.
And the Portuguese was met with a few whistles from the crowd early in the second half after losing possession twice in quick succession.

Team effort won Tamil Union the Premier league - club president
Tamil Union C&AC president Rasakanth Rasiah said that it was team effort that enabled his club to emerge champions in the Premier league tournament and end a 66-year barren run. Tamil Union crushed Galle CC by six wickets with a day to spare after trailing them by 152 runs in the first innings to win the title.
Tamil Union C&AC president Rasakanth Rasiah
They went into this final league match holding onto a nine-point lead over Galle CC. When Tamil Union were shot out for 191 in their first innings in reply to Galles total of 348, it seemed the title that was well within their grasp would elude them. It was then that Tamil Union showed their fighting spirit that has been a feature of their success during the season. Led from the front by their captain Suranga Lakmal, the Sri Lanka fast bowler, Tamil Union shot out Galle CC for a mere 126 in the second innings with Lakmal leading the way with four wickets supported by another Sri Lanka fast bowler Shaminda Eranga with three.
But still Tamil Union had the challenging task of chasing 279 for victory. Dhananjaya de Silva, a prospective Sri Lankan cricketer made certain that there would be no hiccups during the chase by scoring a brilliant 124 that virtually brought Tamil Union to the door step of victory. Former Sri Lanka and SSC batsman Tharanga Paranavitanas unbeaten half-century ensured they got there in style.
Tamil Union were the first holders of the division I inter-club Sara trophy in 1950 and since then they have twice come within touching distance of winning the title but luck was not with them. This win certainly is a huge relief after winning and losing the first Lakspray trophy in 1982/83 and being deprived again in the Centenary Year by a stubborn last wicket stand, recalled Rasiah. It is all about team effort. The national players played whenever they could and all the other players adjusted and played together as a unit. They hit their peak in the Super Eight stage winning all the matches outright including a great one against traditional rivals SSC after 33 years. The team showed that they were not only winners but true champions, he said. The Tamil Union president added that thanks are also due to officials of the club both present and past-for the many sacrifices they had undergone to mould this team - most of whom are from the outstation into a champion unit. The club provides accommodation and even meals to certain players. It is certainly a very welcome reward which we are all proud of, Rasiah said.

Waragoda puts Nalanda in a spin, but its a draw
Off-spinner Supun Waragodas seven-wicket haul (4 for 13 and 3 for 28) for Ananda College was the highlight of the final day in the 87th annual Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter against Nalanda which ended in a tame draw at the SSC grounds yesterday.
A supporter who ran onto the playing area is deftly being shown where he belongs by the long arm of the law.
Ananda continuing from their overnight first innings total of 55 for 1 in reply to Nalandas first innings of 197 declared at 216 runs for four wickets, with a lead of 19 runs. Opener Rahal Avishka made a flying start racing to 84 off 127 balls with 13 fours but fell 16 short of scoring a hundred when he was stumped by Sandaruwan off Kavindu Bandara. Ashel Sigera (41 n.o. with 6 fours) and Kavishka Anjula (44 n.o. with 6 fours and a six) shared an unbroken 61-run stand for the sixth wicket before the declaration. Nalanda in their second innings struggled to 106 for six wickets of which Suhange Wijewardane contributed a fighting unbeaten 40 off 85 balls (3 fours) to stall the Anandians from running through their batting a second time. Waragada with three wickets and a match bag of seven wickets was adjudged the man of the match.
