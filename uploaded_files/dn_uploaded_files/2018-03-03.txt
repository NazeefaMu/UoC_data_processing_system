Blood blooming project, a sheer drama
This is the story of Pohottuwa, the bud. A bud should become something different and complete; because it is the party symbol of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), the bud will bloom, they said with much conviction and expectation of the second coming of Sinhala only of Bandaranaike. Other parties predicted it will wither and negate the expectations. Like a giant in Maha Wanse, Sambanthan exposed the reality.
Speaking in Parliament, the veteran Tamil liberation fighter attacked former fascistic President Mahinda Rajapaksa for creating condition for Elam. He made a sharp point, the veteran democrat, Sambanthan, said that Mahinda, as President had talked of maximum possible devolution, when he inaugurated the All Party Representative Committee (APRC). Latter mentioned, also the Experts Committee appointed by him and led by Prof Tissa Vitharana. Mahinda noted that the report of this committee recommended reforms that went beyond the 13th Amendment; thus creating hope of Thirteen Plus.
Interestingly, Sambanthan mentioned that all the members of the Joint Opposition had unanimously supported the Resolution to turn Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly and had participated in the proceedings of the Steering Committee appointed thereof. Neither Mahinda nor anyone else talked of Eelam, either in the Constituent Assembly or in the Steering Committee, he firmly pointed out.
All this reality he weighed against fascistic jabbering of Mahinda, made during the course of the election campaign. Mahinda screamed idiotically that Tamil Eelam could bloom after the election if the people choose poorly. It was not only Mahinda who said it. Many of the key spokespersons for the SLPP issued that warning. It is obvious, appointing a committee to come up with solutions to Tamil national problem, does not mean that one is preparing for a separate Eelam. Voting for turning Parliament into a Constitutional Assembly does not mean that Mahinda or anyone else was voting for Sampanthans outcome preference. There was more than one report, which came out of the deliberations of the Steering Committee. Nothing finalized has come out of it.
Political solution
Actually contradiction came from the thirteen plus statement and from the maximum devolution pledge made by Mahinda to hoodwink Tamils and international democratic community. Only he would know really why he made such ambiguous statements. He did make them, and thats what counts. And thats why Sambanthan is absolutely right in chastising Mahinda for what is clearly double-talk and therefore irresponsible. Such irresponsibility on the part of The lotus bud as Sambanthan puts it, results in Eelam blooming, is a clever prediction. The notion is interesting. What it implies is that there is a germ of Eelam bud already in the lotus bud.
Sambanthan describes their campaign, I want to put on record that my Party at this Election, in our manifesto, talked of a political solution within the framework of an undivided, indivisible, single country. There was no campaign carried on, anyway, in the North and East which talked of division of the country. We only talked of a solution that is acceptable to our people that are reasonable substantial power-sharing within the framework of a united, undivided, indivisible single country.
While Tamil leaders campaign for a single country lotus bud bearers shout The Eelam bud that is. What is power-sharing if not Federalism What is Power-sharing without talking of history, demography and geography if not devious machinations for land theft based on a myth-model What is substantial in this context if it is not a legitimating of a lie in its extrapolation
Sambanthan however, introduced the real deal. Hes not playing politics-of-the-moment. He is not indulging in conveniences. He is speaking the truth of the Eelam bud. Mahinda uses phrases such as substantial devolution or maximum devolution in a context where Tamils have identified the territory of historical homeland on lines drawn by the history of Jaffna kingdom and bitter struggles since 13th century. Such words are tossed around in ridicule, in a context of a painfully identified legitimate history; a refusal to peruse real evidence to back claims, blood spilled, tears shed. In addition fascistic mockery says:
Lets get this straight. Sambanthan and the Eelamists, now in defence mode and in reduced circumstances following the military rout of the LTTE, are indulging in federalist talk. Federalism is about territories with distinct peoples voluntarily coming together. It naturally implies that having come together, any of the entities thus united (another problematic word used by Sambanthan and his ilk) can voluntarily choose to go it alone. This is bud. This is the rub. This is the bud that the federalists in the business of constitutional reform are carefully and surreptitiously watering and fertilizing. Rajapaksa, because of his careless of ill-advised uttering, has no moral authority to cry foul over Eelam-budding, but that does not mean people need not be concerned about it. After all, when G.G. Ponnambalam was spouting communalism, few would have thought that the 50-50 bud would bloom into a rabid terrorist outfit like the LTTE which would reduce people like Sambanthan into choirboys and cheerleaders.
Rajapaksa camp
The Rajapaksa camp, then, does not have the moral right to raise fears over an Eelam-bud, but it does not follow that the fears expressed are without basis.
He cannot talk, but others can and must. They must because Sambanthan has clearly reiterated that there is an Eelam bud and because the entire constitutional reform project is run by lackeys of the bud-blooming project. Most importantly, they have demonstrated their utter lack of integrity in processes by refusing to enumerate grievances and by refusing to consider undeniable historical, demographic and geographical factors. It has been reduced to a process of predetermining telos and constructing conditions and modeling myths to obtain that end point.
As long as the Eelam-bud exists, then it will be named as such, Sambanthan should understand this. Just because someone doesnt have a moral right to call it such does not mean it does not exist. Sure, various people can nurture it, but the principal gardener is the federalist. Sambanthan, if you want to put a name to it.
Fascistic clowns in the robes of pundits will inevitably end up in the dustbin of history.

Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena, arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue, were yesterday ordered to be further remanded until March 15 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
The court was informed through Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara that notices issued on a previous occasion directing Arjun Aloysius to be present before the CID had not been served.
The Magistrate had issued an order directing former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to appear before the CID to make a statement, before March 8. The notices in this regard were sent through DHL Courier Service.
A representative of DHL Courier Service in Singapore had reported that the recipient has moved out after it visited Arjuna Mahendrans residence in Singapore.
The CID director had also sent an email asking him to appear before the CID on March 8, DSG Jayasundara added.
On February 16, Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne refused to release the two suspects on bail citing that reasons given by the defence are not sufficient enough to consider releasing the suspects on bail under exceptional circumstances.
The suspects have been charged under the Public Property Act, Penal Code, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
The Magistrate observed that the concerned Treasury Bonds can be considered as property described under Section 388 of the Penal Code.
Meanwhile, the Magistrate granted permission to the CID to record statements from Aloysius and Palisena at the Colombo remand prison between March 5 and March 15.
The Magistrate further issued an order directing the Prison Superintendent to take necessary steps regarding the defence complaint that Arjun Aloysius was suffering from a skin disease with ulcer urinary symptoms.
Filing a B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID had named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
The prosecution maintained that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bonds on February 27, 2015.
The prosecution said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged with the criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appeared for the CID.
Defence Counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC with Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke appeared for the suspects.

Consultant Gynaecologist debunks claims about sterilization pill
There is no sterilization pill invented in the world that could make a woman or man infertile by one intake, GMOA Vice President and Consultant Gynaecologist at the National Cancer Institute, Maharagama Dr. Sarada Kannangara said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said fear mongering over mixing sterilizing drugs with food has no scientific base and brushed aside the claims as a canard. At the same time he pointed out that there are much bigger issues people need to worry about, such as the food they consume when it comes to human fertility.
Heavy metals such as Cadmium, Mercury etc., are risk factors for infertility. It has been researched that the continual exposure to such heavy metals can cause reproductive problems. It has been found out that, plastic water bottles (BPA) can cause infertility in males and if the bottles are exposed to the sun the risk is higher. Various food additives and substances added to artificial food, soft drinks and various types of sauce are also risk factors to infertility. Not only infertility, they can also carry abortion risks. These are serious matters people need to pay attention to and correct their food patterns, he commented.
Besides that, there is no pill which could make you barren tomorrow by mixing with the food you take today, he explained.

84th Battle of the Saints:
Daniel shores up Joes with brilliant 93
Sri Lanka under 19 player Jehan Daniel rescued St. Josephs from total disaster with a gallant knock of 93 on the opening day of the 84th Battle of the Saints cricket encounter against St.Peters College at the P. Sara Oval yesterday.
Invited to bat first St Josephs were dismissed for 195 failing to last the 60 overs allowed for both sides in the first innings. The Joes were all out in 53.2 overs.
By stumps the Peterites had batted themselves into a strong position making 190-6 in 49 overs and will look to gain a first innings lead in the remaining 11 overs.
Daniel came to the crease when his side was in dire straits at 47 for 3 falling to the pace of Sri Lanka under 19 player Gunathilake and his right arm fast bowling partner Prabasara Herath who ripped through the Joes top order batting.
Right-arm pacie Gunathilake made early inroads when he dismissed opener Johan de Zilva bowled for 8 while the other opening bowler Herath added salt to the wound of the Josephians when he went through the defence of one drop batsman Nipun Sumanasinghe for 5.
St. Josephs slid to 47 for 3 when left arm spinner Miflal Ameen took the prize wicket of left hander Revan Kelly who had scored 1000 runs for the season - caught by captain Gunathilake at first slip.
Daniel stood tall amongst the ruins playing a captains knock of 93 off 115 balls that included three fours and six sixes.
Incidentally when he was in his late thirties he went for an expansive square drive of off spinner Sachin Silva to be caught brilliantly by wicket keeper Shalith Fernando off a thick edge, but to the utter dismay of the whole Peterite team as well as their supporters umpire Lindon Hannibel shockingly ruled him not out.
Daniel made use of this lucky break to put on a valuable partnership of 46 runs for the seventh wicket with right hander Dineth Jayakody and 34 runs for the eighth wicket with 14 year old former St. Sebastian under 13 left hander Dunith Wellalage to see St. Josephs to a decent first innings score of 195.
The Peterites got the wicket of Jehan Fernandopulle run out for 15 by a brilliant piece of fielding by Herath and Joes were 68 for 4 at the time.
A fifth wicket partnership of 39 between Daniel and wicket keeper Sachintha Ravindu the left hander took the score to 107 before Ravindu was caught at first slip of spinner Sachin Silva.
Within quick succession Joes slumped to 107 for 6 when left handed all-rounder Lakshan Gamage was caught brilliantly by Ruvin Seneviratne at extra cover for a duck once again off Silva.
Then Jayakody was stumped by wicket keeper Shalith Fernando of 14 year old left arm spinner Kanishka Maduwantha for 13 and Daniel was finally out caught by Sulakshana Fernando of left armer Ameen seven short of a well deserved century with the score 187 for 8. At the same score Wellalage was bowled by off spinner Silva for 13 and Joes were soon all out for 195 when Miranga Wickramanayake was run out for 10.
The Petrites coming to bat after tea were soon in trouble at two down for nine runs when Joes right arm fast bowlers Lakshan Gamage and Johan de Zilva sent both openers skipper Gunathilake (2) and Shanon Fernando for a duck.
But the Peterites recovered to score 190 for 5 at close thanks to fighting partnership of 91 runs for the third wicket between one drop batsman Sulakshana Fernando (16) and wicket-keeper cum number four batsman Shalith Fernando who hit a superb 58 off 73 balls with six fours and two sixes.
Ranmith Jayasena who is expected to lead St Peters next season joined the run parade cracking 55 off 68 balls with four boundaries. He was unfortunately dismissed two overs before the close by right arm leggie Ashain Daniel who had him stumped by keeper Sachintha Ravindu.
The match continues today.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Kandys Battle of the Golds tomorrow
Kandys first cricket big match is the 20th encounter between Wariyapola Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College and Sri Rahula College called the Battle of the Golds that will take place at the Pallekelle International Stadium today and tomorrow. They are also the two of the oldest schools in Kandy. Cricket is one of the major sports at the two schools. Sri Sumangala has a long history which is 139 years old originating under the name St. Pauls College as a junior school of Trinity College. After laying the first brick on 8 February 1879 after 100 years in the 1980s, the name was changed to Wariyapola Sri Sumangala College. They first played cricket in 1894. The school gave up the sport and after an 87-year-long layoff; they re-started cricket in 1981.
This was largely due to the efforts of former Sri Lanka cricketer and Kandy Municipal Council Commissioner the late D.H. de Silva. He coached them to play cricket. Special mention must be made of D.D.T. Alwis, a long time coach. Sri Rahula College Katugastota is also one of the oldest cricket playing schools having started the game of cricket in 1890s but gave it up a few years later and were more involved with football, athletics and hockey. However, in the 1970s they came back with cricket. A big hand should go to Aubrey Kuruppu, who did his best as coach. Aubrey is a former S. Thomas College, Combined Schools, University of Peradeniya, Saracens SC, Central Province and Sri Lanka Presidents XI cricketer and cricket commentator.
He trained many cricketers to come up in the game, unfortunately though, when they come up to under 17 level they are being snatched up by other schools. It is going to be two good days of cricket if the weather stays good with batsmen expected to dominate the game. The luck of the coin will go a long way in deciding the outcome of the match.
Fazil says goodbye on his own terms
A match winner and a draw card wherever he plays ruggerite Fazil Marija ended his career with the Clifford Cup finals on Sunday. Now 36, Fazil bid farewell at Longden Place. There's little doubt Marija's rugby career will always be etched in the minds of all rugby players and not be forgotten.
He loved the game, was a good team man and was someone who was very passionate about the game. He prepared very well and gave his all to his club and country. He thanked his family for their support and patience with his long rugby career, and the man who made him international class level Mr. Rugby Malik Samawickrema. The way Marija played the game is a model for all young players coming up and to Sri Lanka rugby.

KOICA has also donated high-tech laboratory equipment to the Criminal Investigations Department, established a tourism-sector training center in the Wattala area, and provided fellowship to Sri Lankan government officials to attend trainings in Korea.
Apart from grants, the Korea Eximbank, which opened a branch in Colombo two years ago, has been providing loans for the Sri Lankan government.

Lalith Weeratunga allowed to travel abroad
The Court of Appeal yesterday allowed former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga who was convicted of misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC, to go abroad over a period of one month.
The Attorney General did not raise objections to the request made by the defence.
Taking into consideration a revision application filed by Lalith Weeratunga, the Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench comprising Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne ordered to set aside the Colombo High Courts decision to reject Weeratungas request to go abroad.
On January 29, the Colombo High Court had rejected a request made by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga that he be allowed to go abroad.
Weeratunga who was convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) had sought the Colombo High Courts permission to travel to Doha, Qatar and Australia in the months of March and April.
While rejecting the application, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had observed there is no legal basis to consider this application since a person convicted of an offence has no right to be presumed innocent.
The High Court Judge further observed that the accuseds request cannot be considered as an urgent requirement since his request was not based on a medical requirement.
On September 7 last year, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs.600 million of funds belonging to TRC in connection with the controversial Sil Redi (Fabrics used by devotees to observe Sil) distribution case.
They were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
They had filed appeal petitions in the Court of Appeal challenging the judgment of the Colombo High Court. They are currently out on bail.
Counsel Kanchana Ratwatte appeared for Lalith Weeratunga. Senior State Counsel Nayomi Wickremasekara appeared for the Attorney General.

Most sixes conceded by a bowler in a Twenty20 International
No bowler wants to watch his deliveries sent out of the fence but Yuzvendra Chahal was hit for as many as seven sixes in the 2nd T20I game in Centurion. The leg-spinner took the trashing from the South African batsmen as he conceded 64 runs in his four overs without any success.
Chahal, who is known for his braveness in bowling attacking line, was hit for as many as 41 runs in 12 balls by Heinrich Klaasen in the game. The home team chased down 189 banking on fifties from Klaasen and JP Duminy to level the series.
Beginning from the last years A team triangular series in South Africa, Klaasen made 110 runs against Chahal in 74 balls with six fours and eight sixes. The Indian bowler claimed the wicket of Klaasen only once in seven innings they faced off.
The South African wicket-keeper hit three sixes in Chahals first two overs and two in a row in the 3rd over. JP Duminy hit one more six in that over which yielded them 23 runs while Farhaan Behardien hit one in the final over of the leg-spinner. With those seven sixes, Chahal became the first Indian to conceded seven sixes in a T20I game.
Ravindra Jadeja conceded six sixes in the 2010 WT20 game against Australia despite bowling only two overs. He was taken on for three consecutive sixes on the last three balls of his first over and three more maximums on the first three deliveries of his second over which turned out to his last as well. Jadeja and Chahal conceded five sixes in a T20I innings during last years matches while Stuart Binny was hit for five sixes in the record high-scoring game in Lauderhill in 2016.
Chahals seven sixes in this game are also the joint-most number of sixes conceded by a bowler in a T20I match. Four players other than Chahal have achieved this unwanted feat with the last one being Andrew Tye during the recent high-scorer against New Zealand at the Eden Park in Auckland. Stuart Broad was the first player to enter the list after being hit for sixes in an over he bowled to Yuvraj Singh in the 2007 WT20 match in Durban. - CT

Myanmar defends troop build-up
MYANMAR: Myanmar on Friday defended deploying fresh troops to a border zone with Bangladesh where thousands of Rohingya refugees are camped, blaming a militant threat as Dhaka called for an immediate retreat to lower tensions along the troubled frontier.
The increased security presence this week has centred around a strip of no man's land between the two countries where some 6,000 Rohingya sought shelter after fleeing a brutal Myanmar army crackdown last August.
The military campaign drove some 700,000 Rohingya across the border in total, with most travelling on to sprawling refugee settlements in Bangladesh's southeastern border district of Cox's Bazar.
The UN has accused Myanmar of waging an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Muslim minority.
Yet Myanmar has staunchly defended the crackdown as an effort to snuff out Rohingya militants who raided police posts last year.
The recent spike in security along the border is a response to new intelligence about the movement of Rohingya militants, said Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay.
We acted this way based on the information we got regarding terrorism, especially the ARSA movement, he told AFP, using an acronym for the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, a militant group, and declining to elaborate further.
It was not aimed at antagonising Bangladesh, he added.
On Thursday Bangladesh's foreign ministry said it summoned Myanmar's envoy to call for an immediate pullback of Myanmar security forces along with military assets from the area. In recent weeks the Rohingya living in the no man's land strip have faced growing pressure from Myanmar soldiers, who have stepped up patrols along the barbed-wire border fence near the camp and ordered the group to leave over loudspeakers.
On Thursday some 100 Myanmar soldiers arrived near the refugee camp in heavy military vehicles, according to Bangladesh border guards and Rohingya.
The heightened tensions will do little to speed-up a stalled repatriation plan signed by the neighbours in January.
The process was delayed at the last moment due to lack of preparations and protests by the refugees, who fear returning to Myanmar without guarantees of basic safety and citizenship.
Myanmar has branded the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and systematically dismantled their legal rights and access to basic services in Rakhine, a state where they have lived for generations.

89th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter today :
Nalanda have the edge over Ananda in bowling
Nalanda College will be banking on a better bowling attack than their traditional rivals Ananda College to bring a long overdue win for them when they meet in the 89th Battle of the Maroons cricket encounter for the Dr NM Perera memorial trophy starting at the SSC grounds today.
We have a good bowling attack and our bowlers will control the game. Anandians have a good batting line but I think their bowling side is poor, said Nalanda coach Keerthi Gunaratne, a former Sri Lanka fast bowler. We can see a very tough game in this years big match.
Nalanda captain Lakshitha Manasinghe also harboured hopes on his bowling line up to bring victory to his team.
I think both schools have well balanced teams. I expect a big challenge from the Ananda batting line, but we have a good bowling squad to face that challenge, said Rasanjana. We also have stylish batsmen like Suhanga, Avishka and Chamindu while Ravin and Kaveesh will give a fullest support to our team.
The Nalanda team is packed with five all rounders like skipper Lakshitha, vice captain Suhanga Wijewardana, Kaveesh Madurapperuma, Chamindu Wijesinghe and Ravin de Silva.
Last years big match centurion Lakshitha has scored 780 runs and bagged 49 wickets this season. He also made an unbeaten century and two half tons. Sri Lanka under 19 player and deputy skipper Suhanga Wijewardana has also done well with 627 runs and showed his talents as a pacer. Another key role player is fresher Chamindu Wijesinghe who has made 570 runs and bagged 48 wickets while 2nd year coloursman Kaveesh Madurapperuma has scored 187 runs and claimed 59 wickets with a best of 5 for 9. All-rounder Ravin de Silva has a haul of 47 wickets and scored 240 runs.
Stylish batsman Avishka Perera whose had a good season scoring over 550 runs including three half centuries will be relied upon to score heavily.
Nalandas fast bowling squad comprises four pacemen Suhanga Wijewardana, Madushan Hasaranga, Chamindu Wijesinghe and Nipun Devinda. Their match winners have been left-arm spinner Kaveesh Madurapperuma (59 wickets), off spinner Lakshitha (49), left arm spinner Umeksha Dilshan (30), right arm leg spinner Ravin de Silva (47) and off spinner Mahima Weerakoon.
Nalanda has recorded four outright wins this season in 20 matches against Isipathana, DS Senanayake, Dharmapala Pannipitiya and Dharmaraja Kandy and suffered two outright losses to St. Joseph Vaz and S. Thomas Mount Lavinia.
All rounder and 4th year coloursman Asela Sigera leads Ananda and under his captaincy they have scored three outright wins from 13 matches against Zahira Colombo, Dharmapala Pannipitiya and Lumbini Vidyalaya and suffered an outright loss to St. Josephs College.
Our team has had good preparations for the big match and I am satisfied with my team. We have a good bowling attack and a strong batting line up. We are confident of winning this, said Sigera.
Ananda coach Ramesh Perera said, We have a strong batting line up and very talented bowlers. We performed well this school cricket season and our players are now in a winning mood.
Ananda are strong with six all rounders including three centurions like deputy skipper Lahiru Attanayake (108 n.o.), Dushan Hettige (114) and Daminda Reshan (100). In the batting line up skipper Sigera has scored 450 runs and claimed 52 wickets. Attanayaka is the leading run getter with 700 runs under his belt inclusive of seven fifties and a century against Trinity College. Shamal Hirushan has contributed 411 runs and bagged 30 wickets while Reshan has claimed 34 wickets and made 300 runs and Hettige 620 runs including three centuries and three half tons.
Stylish batsman Kanishka Ranthilakage has topped the 500 run mark along with 2nd year coloursman Kavindu Gimhana who has made 300 runs.
Sigera will lead the spin bowling attack with 42 wickets and left arm orthodox Reshan will support him having captured 34 wickets with his off spin. Much is expected of Gishan Vishwajith, Chamika Gunasekara, Shamal Hirushan and Dushan Hettige.
The two schools started their big match series in 1924 and so far Ananda has won 12 times and Nalanda on six occasions with the rest of the matches ending in draws. Ananda last won in 2003 under Duminda Kularatne and Nalanda in 1953 under W Wimalaratne Silva.
Ananda established a record for the most consecutive victories in the history of the encounter by winning the Big Match during the years 1937, 1938 and 1939. The match between the two schools was not played in 1943, 1944 and 1945 due to the 2nd World War. The Maroons encounter was also not played in 1948, the year in which Sri Lanka gained Independence.
Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider Dialog Axiata PLC will be the main sponsor for the encounter and the One Day match that will be played on March 18 at the same venue.

PM predicts bright future for Sri Lanka economically
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the Investors Forum in Singapore assured the international investor community that Sri Lanka was committed to forging ahead with its reforms agenda.
He said Sri Lanka had put in place measures that would not only make it an attractive place to do business, but ensure that the country becomes the knowledge-based highly competitive economy it is poised to.
Sri Lanka is on the path of becoming an attractive place for business in South Asia, one of the fasted growing regions of the world, the Premier said. Sri Lanka as an island is increasingly becoming a vital player in the region enabling us to punch above our weight, a lesson we learnt from Singapore, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister reiterating further on the reform agenda said that Sri Lanka had taken numerous initiatives to stabilise and re-orient the economy.
Moving from a growth model dependent on debt-fuelled public infrastructure spending to an outward looking one driven by private enterprises, exports, and Foreign Direct Investments,the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was delivering the Keynote Speech at the Investor Forum organised by the Colombo Stock Exchange, Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka and the Singapore Sri Lanka Business Association, held at the Four Seasons hotel in Singapore yesterday.
Referring to the ease of doing business, the Premier revealed that by mid-2018, the time taken to register a new business will reduce from six days to just one day. Finding land and registering property will be halved from 51 days to 26 days, and the procedures reduced from nine steps to two steps.
He elaborated further stating that they were introducing an Electronic Single Window that would link dozens of state agencies dealing with international trade through a few clicks.
Through the new Colombo International Financial City, the present Port City project, we are creating a unique business climate that is globally-competitive.
This new city will function as a special economic zone and have a conducive and transparent regulatory system. It will provide an environment for your companies like no other in this region.The enabling legislation is now in the preparatory stage. We plan to launch the gallery mid this year  you should visit, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that the government was complementing these efforts with comprehensive trade policy reforms.
He mentioned the recent budget removed protectionist para-tariffs on over 1,200 items, with the rest slated for removal in 2018 and 2019. We know we can leverage on our strategic location to expand market access. Therefore we are expanding our trade and investment relationships with a diverse set of countries, such as the US, EU, India, China, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia.
The Prime Minister also spoke on the possibility of closing in on two bilateral agreements, an Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement with India which would deepen the existing FTA and a comprehensive FTA with China.
These agreements are an important part of the new National Trade Policy launched last year, and are a linchpin in the ongoing trade policy reforms. They will add on to the advantage created by our access to the EUs GSP+ facility. This means that through our preferential market access, any business located in Sri Lanka would be able to access nearly 3 billion people from Spain to China - we are probably one of the very few countries in the world that can claim this! This only adds on to our strategic geographical advantages  we are 1 hour from 5 fast-growing South Indian States, have quick access to the Bay of Bengal region, and only a few hours from South East Asia and the Middle East,Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister mentioned about attracting more Belt and Road projects from China adding that they expect a lot of investor interest in the new Logistics and Industrial Zones near the southern port of Hambantota, which is being developed with Chinese investment.
Three other large industrial zones are being set up, including one in partnership with a private investor from Thailand. We also expect to develop tourist zones and domestic airports across the country, to facilitate the booming tourism industry.
A key initiative on this front will be a highway connecting Hambantota in the South, Colombo, and Kandy in the centre of the country. A highly developed economic infrastructure system connecting two ports, two international airports, 3 major cities, the Premier said.
Referring to the macroeconomic front, the Prime Ministerhe added that when the Unity Government took over the economy in 2015, they had a challenging task where National debt had been mismanaged, and fiscal and monetary policy lacked discipline. Since then, we have taken appropriate measures to build back our economys strength and resilience. We are very focused on fiscal consolidation, and the results are already visible  the tax to GDP ratio has improved, and ratings agencies are providing favourable outlooks. Next month, a new Inland Revenue Act will come into effect, providing a progressive, modern, and transparent income tax policy, The Premier said.
The tax incentives regime is now firmly written into the law, and is based on investment allowances. The top rate of income tax is now lower than many countries in the region. Other revenue initiatives  VAT reforms, predictability in tax incentives, digitization of revenue administration  are all part of the fiscal reforms we have embarked on, guided by the on-going IMF programme. The Exchange Control Act has been replaced by a new Foreign Exchange Act. The forecast for the Sri Lanka Economy 2018 states amongst others that, Merchandise exports is anticipated to grow by 10.7%.

The poor in South Asia
South Asia with 22 percent of the world population and 1.3 percent of the worlds income has 60 percent of the worlds poor. Thus, the majority of the poor lives in South Asia.
However, only those below the income level of US $ 2 per day have been counted as poor. It fails to recognize several other factors that equally define poverty. The $2 limit is an arbitrary number which does not take into account the peculiarities in each individual country and the level of development reached by countries.
For poverty is a relative concept. There is absolute poverty and relative poverty. Though there is no absolute poverty populations could be poor in comparison with the well-to-do. Poverty alleviation cannot be reduced to an increase in monetary income alone. It could also hide causes of poverty.
In most Third World countries poverty is an inherited trait. It is a factor of underdevelopment, often due to colonial plunder of their resources. However, there could also be new forms of poverty, viz., those connected with development. Such are those evicted from their traditional settlements due to development projects. Similarly natural disasters such as droughts and floods could also throw hundreds into poverty.
It has also been shown that the lack of an equitable distribution of a nations resources is also a contributory factor to poverty. Reduction of inequity in distribution makes a greater impact on poverty alleviation than simple reduction of the gap between the rich and the poor. For when the poor increases their income, the income of the rich increases much faster. This has led to the widening of the rich-poor gap and an increase in the ratio of one to the other.
Poverty alleviation needs much more than income support. There should be a holistic approach, which necessarily include the development of physical and social infrastructure. Of special importance is skills development or human resources development.
Structural defects in the economies that have marginalized entire communities due to historic factors also contribute to the perpetuation of poverty and they require special efforts for their elimination.
South Africa to affect radical land reform
South African Parliament has passed a resolution to amend Section 25 of the Constitution to enable the government to carry out a radical land reform that would end racial disparities in land ownership which persist more than two decades after the end of apartheid.
The resolution passed by an overwhelming majority of 241 votes to 83 votes against was brought forward by Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, and was approved after an amendment proposed by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) was incorporated.
Two weeks ago South Africa's new President Cyril Ramaphosa said he would speed up the transfer of land from white to black owners. However, he stressed it must be conducted in a manner which preserved food production and security.
I will shortly initiate a dialogue with key stakeholders, he said, adding: There is no need for any one of us to panic and start beating war drums.
We are going to address this and make sure that we come up with resolutions that resolve this once and for all. This original sin that was committed when our country was colonized must be resolved in a way that will take South Africa forward.
Border dispute threatens Brexit deal
British Prime Minister Theresa May has rejected a proposal by the European Union to establish a common regulatory area between Brussels and Northern Ireland.
She said: The draft legal text the Commission has published would, if implemented, undermine the UK common market and threaten the constitutional integrity of the UK by creating a customs and regulatory border down the Irish Sea, and no UK prime minister could ever agree to it.
The EU proposal outlined by the bloc's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, states a common regulatory area between the EU and Northern Ireland would be established in the event an EU-UK agreement on a future relationship fails to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland.
The EU document further said: The common regulatory area shall constitute an area without internal borders in which the free movement of goods is ensured and North-South cooperation protected in accordance with this Chapter.  The territory of Northern Ireland, excluding the territorial waters of the United Kingdomshall be considered to be part of the customs territory of the Union.
In response to the British refusal to accept a common regulatory area EU Chief Negotiator Barnier called on Britain to provide better ideas on how to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, while preserving the integrity of the single market.

Protracted challenges
The Cabinet reshuffle of last Sunday keeps reverberating in the politics of the day due to its necessary association with the result of the recent Local Government Poll, which saw a major failure for the Unity Government. That the reshuffle was only half complete, being confined to the UNP Ministers, is also a considerable disadvantage in efforts to move ahead after the poor showing at the LG Poll; as it continued to show a lack of necessary unity in government, especially in the context of the strong criticism and attacks on the UNP and its leader, the Prime Minister, by SLFP members of the unity coalition.
President Sirisena moved away to some extent from the thinking and statements of key SLFP Cabinet Ministers, who made the strongest calls for the end of the coalition of unity and removal of the Prime Minister. This was in his call to study the poll defeat in its proper context, and correctly understand the causes of the massive voter rejection, and see how best these results could be applied to take the government ahead in its remaining period.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the UNP do have continuing issues, although the party did come far ahead of the SLFP-UPFA in its second position in the poll, with reports of dissent within the party, rejection of the re-shuffle by some backbench members, and the call by some for a motion of no-confidence in the Prime Minister. It will be necessary for the party to address these issues with speed, with proper understanding of how its policies and practices contributed to the major setback of the unity coalition, and the huge success of the SLPP.
The SLFP act
A larger issue facing the unity coalition is the need for an effective study in terms of wider politics and voter rejection of the SLFP itself, in terms of the massive defeat it suffered. The fact that the larger voter base in the country is in the rural agricultural sector, and the subject of agriculture was in the hands of the partys General Secretary is a cause for concern. This is especially so in the context of the failure to supply of fertilizer to cultivators. The defeat in the largely agricultural areas in Raja Rata and Wayamba  that combined Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Kurunegala  is of special significance. As pointed out by analysts, the SLFPs key functionary  its General Secretary, is elected from Anuradhapura that saw a huge defeat, and Polonnaruwa being so closely linked to the party leader, the President, also raises concerns about policies affecting the agricultural community.
The SLFP also has several other ministries such as Transport and Disaster Management, with closer interaction with the public and wider rejection of policies by the voters as seen in these results. A proper analysis of these results in terms of ministerial and related administrative activity is of necessity, if the message of the post-poll reshuffle is to have any impact on the progress of the government.
The UNP task
A key aspect of public interest is in the portfolio of Law and Order being given to the Prime Minister, especially in the context of it being a ministry that has to deal the follow up on the Central Bank bond issue. Statements that this is only a temporary assignment is encouraging; with the understanding that the poll result and its own shake up has not taken the bond issue away from the public mind. The UNP also has to do a good rethink on major economic issues it has been having a control of in the past three years, and the wider interest that President Sirisena shows in guiding economic policies. The situation arising from the bond issue does give some strength to his position; making it necessary to have a better understanding between the UNP and the President, in the better formulation of economic and financial policies in the period ahead.
There recent developments have brought to light the major differences between the UNP and SLFP on political ideology. These differences have prevailed over decades, with the UNPs economic strategies more associated with Free Trade and neo-liberal policies. The SLFP has been associated with pro-State controlled policies closer to the old Welfare State and an emphasis on people control. These are two conflicting paths, but the reality of a governing coalition requires a better understanding of the differences in the context of moving together, in keeping with the pledge to move ahead while fighting corruption. The policy statements of January and August 2015 had little emphasis on economic strategies. The necessity today is to work on the practical possibilities of a coalition of unity, and consider the best policies acceptable to the people, who are not largely associated with particular ideologies. The progress of government will depend on such understanding, and less of individual or party rivalries.
The Lasantha killing and more
Law and Order remains the area of importance in political developments, continuing with the considerable delays in bringing the corruption of the previous regime to book. With increasing reports that the new minister on Law and Order would be Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka (SF), there has been a statement by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa (GR) to probe SFs alleged role in the assassination of Lasantha Wickrematunge. This call comes in the context of allegations about GRs own alleged role in this assassination.
As a journalist who has been in the fight against violence directed at journalists and the media from its inception, this call by GR certainly needs comment. Let us first place on record that both GR and SF are innocent of this crime, and should be treated as such. What is of considerable interest in who is to be further investigated in this regard is that Lasantha Wickrematunge was assassinated in January 2009, and we are now in March 2018. There were seven years since the tragedy when the Unity Government resumed investigations. Whoever may be the guilty, what had the then government, in which GR was the Secretary, Ministry of Defence, and whose brother, President Rajapaksa had direct control over the Police and Justice too, done in bringing the assassin/s of Lasantha to book The new probes are showing that he was not killed by a gun bullet, but a different weapon; there are reports of the initial information to the police on this brutal killing being hidden or even distorted. Senior police personnel who were associated with this investigation have now been produced in court.
Whoever is to be questioned in this continuing inquiry, what can anyone in the previous government, especially those who held key positions in Defence, Police and Justice, have to say about this huge, in fact criminal, delay in bringing the killer/s of Lasantha to court It is necessary that the new Minister of Law and Order (whoever he is), will carry out a proper, but speedy probe and bring the suspect killer/s and related conspirators to justice. There can be no more cause for further delay, let the best investigators be given this task and the truth revealed.
Although there is no comment by GR or anyone else about it, this is also a call for a better and complete probe into the killing of Wasim Thajudeen, that rugby captain, whose death was reported as an accidental death in the days of the Rajapaksa Regime, and is now found to be a killing. Here too, the necessity for a speedy conclusion of a genuinely thorough probe is necessary, bringing to court whoever the suspects and accused could be; however high their connections with the previous regime may have been.
A further call for a good and thorough probe is into the absence or disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda, another journalist; whose continued absence has raised many genuine concerns about the role of services personnel, whose task and duty was not the capture, hiding and final absence of any journalist. These are tasks the new Minister of Law and Order will have to give precedence to, very much in the context of the public feelings expressed in the recent poll, although the winners may prefer to be silent on such criminal matters.
Ampara and Thambuttegama
The government should also pay important attention to the situation in Ampara, where there has been a major threat to communal and religious harmony, showing signs of a resurgence of the situation that took place in the Beruwela -Alutgama areas some years ago. It is necessary for all measures to bring about peace and understanding to be used in this regard in the wider context of unity and conciliation among communities that make up the Sri Lankan nation.
There is also the necessity for action to prevent any further violent protests over the attempt to use the water of the Rajangana Wewa, meant for agriculture, for the production of bottled water for commercial profit. This is giving good ear to agricultural realities, more than support for commercial interests of more profit than service.

Renovation of 2400 irrigation tanks begins
The inauguration of the programme of renovating of 2400 irrigation tanks began yesterday under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena with the intention of recreating the ancient irrigation development in the country.
Irrigation tanks, which were not renovated for a long period of time, in the North, East, North Western and North Central provinces will also be renovated under this programme.123 irrigation tanks in the Polonnaruwa district will be developed in the first phase. The renovation of the Chandana Pokuna tank in Hingurakgoda area began under the patronage of the President as the first irrigation tank of this programme yesterday.
This lake provides water to cultivate thousands of acres of land since the time of ancient kings. The Chandana Pokuna lake which has a gross water capacity of 800 acre/feet provides its benefits to 300 farming families in the area.
These renovation works carried out with the support of the Sri Lanka Army under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa (Awakening of Polonnaruwa) District Development Project.
The President said that the objective of this programme is to strengthen the economy of the farmer community as well as to strengthen the national economy of the country by giving a new impetus for the field of agriculture and food production.
The President pointed out that under the previous government too similar projects were implemented, but as a result of not implementing properly, those programmes were not successful. The President said it is the responsibility of everybody to contribute to achieve success in this programme to give a better living standard for the farming community in the country.
The renovation activities of the Chandana Pokuna was estimated to be around Rs. 16 million. However, later it was decided to carry out renovation with the assistance of the Sri Lanka Army with an expenditure of around Rs. 2.5 million.
Public representatives of the area, including Polonnaruwa District Secretary Ranjith Ariyarathna, Pibidemu Polonnaruwa development project director Major General Sudantha Ranasinghe was present.

Save our leopards
Newspapers reported last week that the Yala National Park has recorded the highest-ever income of Rs.700 million in 2017. Most people visit Yala to catch a glimpse of the elusive Sri Lankan Leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya), the only big cat found in Sri Lanka, which is called Diviya in Sinhalese and Siruththai in Tamil.
With a population of less than 1,000 individuals left, the Sri Lankan leopard has been included in the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Endangered Species. Several incidents of poaching of leopards have been reported recently, further highlighting the need for protecting this vulnerable species.
Worldwide, all big cats are facing a number of threats including habitat loss, poaching and hunting, illegal trade and extinction. Trophy hunting of big cats is still legal in many countries, which adds to the cats woes. The time has come to take concrete action to conserve these majestic species.
Hence the World Wildlife Day, which falls today (March 3) is celebrated in 2018 under the theme Big cats: predators under threat. World Wildlife Day gives us an opportunity to raise awareness about their plight and to galvanize support for the many global and national actions that are underway to save these iconic species.
The expanded definition of big cats is now being used by wildlife experts, which includes not only lion, tiger, leopard and jaguar -- the four largest wild cats that can roar - but also cheetah, snow leopard, puma and clouded leopard. Big cat species are found in Africa, Asia, and North, Central and South America, representing a virtually global distribution with the exception of Europe, Australia and Antarctica.
Big cats are among the most widely recognized and admired animals across the globe. However, these predators are facing varied threats, which are mostly caused by human activities. Overall, their populations are declining at a disturbing rate due to loss of habitat and prey, conflicts with people, poaching and illegal trade.
Tiger populations have plummeted by 95% over the past 100 years (fewer than 9,500 remain in the wild today) and African lion populations have dropped by 40% in just 20 years. In fact, lions have completely disappeared from 26 African countries. Some species such as the Amur Leopard (Panthera pardus orientalis) is down to about 60 individuals, making them critically endangered. If no action is taken to save the Asian tigers and leopards, they might face the same fate as the Asiatic Lion (Panthera leo persica) which is now found only in Gujarat, India.
A few decades from now, you will be able to see some of these majestic creatures only through pictures or at zoological gardens if no serious efforts are made to increase their numbers in the wild. Ironically, zoos are one of the best ways of wildlife conservation. Zoo breeding programmes help various species to diversify their gene pool and increase their numbers, albeit in small increments.
Just a few months ago, two Sri Lankan leopard cubs Yala and Nimala were born at the Bonham Zoo in the UK. This is a boost for the Sri Lankan leopard, which needs every possible help. Likewise, the main zoological gardens in Dehiwela is known worldwide for its breading and research programmes  three lion cubs were born there a few weeks ago. The zoo should enlighten visitors about these programmes as well, without just being an exhibition of animals.
It is vital to educate the people, especially those in villages bordering the leopard habitats, about the importance of conserving them. This is being done successfully in India where many organisations help the villagers to co-exist with the animals. Attacks on people give the leopards a bad name, but many fail to see why the leopards or other cats enter human territory. Most often, the cats face a habitat loss as humans encroach on their territory (we have seen this with elephants as well). Factors such as climate change also play a role as animals are forced to go to human habitats in search of water and food, which can sometimes unfortunately be livestock. This creates a conflict between animal and man for which finding a viable solution is extremely hard.
Sri Lankan zoologists and researchers should play a more prominent role in efforts to conserve big cats worldwide. Learning from other countries about their conservation programmes will give a better chance for our conservationists to help leopards to thrive. Restricting visitor numbers to Yala was just one step that could help the leopards to continue their dominance at Yala.
Education can play a vital role in protecting the Sri Lankan leopard and indeed, all other wild native wild cats such as the Fishing Cat (Prionailurus viverrinus) Jungle Cat (Felis chaus) and Rusty Spotted Cat (Prionailurus rubiginosus). Schoolchildren and the general population know little or nothing about these precious cats. A lesson on these cats must be included in the school curriculum and electronic media must educate the public on them. That will boost efforts to conserve the wild cats of Sri Lanka.

Special Envoy on Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention to visit here
Special Envoy on the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention Prince Mired Raad Zeid Al-Hussein will undertake an official visit to Sri Lanka from March 4 to 7.
The visit of the Special Envoy takes place in the wake of Sri Lanka becoming the 163rd State Party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention, having deposited the Instrument of Accession in December 2017.
According to the government news portal, Sri Lankas accession to the Convention has been hailed by the international community as a very positive development, and it has immensely contributed towards building a positive image of Sri Lanka in the international arena, the government said in a statement.
During his visit, Prince Mired is scheduled to call on the President and Prime Minister, and to meet with Secretaries to the Ministries of Defence and Resettlement, Commander of the Army, and officials in-charge of mine-clearance.
The visit also includes a field visit to a mine-clearance site in Muhamalai, Jaffna on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News the Coordinator of the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) Vidya Abhayagunawardena said it is a huge achievement for Sri Lanka.
This is the first time that a special envoy to the mine ban treaty has visited the country. In fact, Sri Lanka is a success story in mine clearance. We have the lowest rate of mine related incidents in the region compared to other countries such as Cambodia, Laos etc. Sri Lanka reported only two mine related incidents last year, having cleared 500 sq. km of mine infested area by the end of the war. Currently, Sri Lanka has just 27 sq. km left to be cleared, he noted. The government also intends to complete mine clearance activities by 2020. If we can achieve that target, Sri Lanka would be the first country in the region to rid the country of mines completely. Then, Sri Lanka would become Universalisation Ambassadors to the convention. Meanwhile,the Cabinet last Tuesday took the decision to become party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions. This year happens to be the 10 anniversary of the UN Convention on Cluster Munitions.
Sri Lanka also ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities on February 2016.

Sri Lankas leadership at Geneva Conference on Disarmament commended
The Decision arrived at during Sri Lankas Presidency of the Conference on Disarmament (CD) to resume substantive work, and the role played in this regard by Sri Lanka's Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha, had been commended during the High-Level Segment of the CD held in Geneva this week.
In his address to the CD on February 26, UN Secretary-General (UNSG) Antonio Guterres, referred to the recent Decision of February 16 as an effort to find ways to break the long-standing stalemate in this Conference". He said: I believe you are off to the best start in nearly two decades, and I look forward to building on this new momentum.
At a follow-up meeting held on the sidelines of the High-Level Segment, UNSGs High Representative for Disarmament Affairs Izumi Nakamitsu said she was "deeply impressed and grateful for the leadership offered by Ambassador Aryasinha in adopting the Decision which is a contribution not only to the CD, but also towards the overall objective of disarmament".
She requested Sri Lanka to help with the immediate next steps in the implementation of the recent CD Decision.
The Executive Secretary of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) Lassina Zerbo, in his address at the High - Level Segment, noted that the decision taken by the Conference on February 16 has sent a very encouraging message to the international community: Concrete steps are being taken to advance the substantive work of the Conference on Disarmament.
The Foreign Minister of the current CD Presidency  Sweden, Margot Wallstrmobserved: It is in these times of hardship that we must multiply our efforts and show that the Conference on Disarmament, as a platform for diplomacy, can achieve results that bring us closer to our common goal of disarmament. During the past weeks, intensive consultations have been conducted under the able leadership of the Ambassador of Sri Lanka. During these consultations, we sensed that there was an emerging will, underpinned by a spirit of compromise, to get the CD back on track. That sense proved correct. The CD eventually managed to adopt a decision that paves the way for structured discussions.
My gratitude also goes to the Ambassador of Sri Lanka Ravinatha Aryasinha for his hard and successful efforts to establish Subsidiary Bodies of the CD, the Minister added.
In their statements to the High-Level Segment, Ministers and Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs from Brazil, Egypt, Iran, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Myanmar, Romania, Russia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Switzerland and Venezuela commended the recent Decision and Sri Lankas leadership role. Earlier, the delegations from Australia, China, Cuba, France, India, Pakistan, Spain, UK, and the USA had welcomed and extended support for the decision secured during Sri Lanka's Presidency.
Meanwhile, in an analysis written on the February 16 decision titled "The Conference on Disarmament agrees to start working: a wake-up call for 'sleeping beauty'", Marc Finaud, Senior Programme Advisor and Arms Proliferation Cluster Leader, Emerging Security Challenges Programme, at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy (GCSP), observed: "On February 16, 2018, after intensive consultations, the current President of the Geneva Conference on Disarmament (CD), Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha of Sri Lanka, banged his gavel to mark the decision of the CD to start substantive work.
This decision may not have hit the headlines in the world media, but for most members of the disarmament community, it was an unexpected achievement. In recent years, the 65 members of the Conference, established in 1979, agreed by consensus on a formal programme of work only in 1998 and 2009. Those attempts were short-lived since they were defeated by further disagreements about which items to negotiate on and on linkages established between some of those issues.
This is why the CD, which had not negotiated any single agreement since the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty adopted in 1996, was often derided as the Geneva Sleeping Beauty .
"The compromise achieved, thanks to the diplomatic skills of the President, paves the way for the establishment of four subsidiary bodies (Ad Hoc Committees) to explore the possible common ground on the so-called four core issues of the agenda (adopted by the UN General Assembly).
In addition, a fifth subsidiary body will examine the remaining agenda items. This decision reflects the necessary constructive ambiguity and the flexibility required to rally consensus between the states that wish to jump-start the negotiations and those who are less enthusiastic and advocate more exploratory talks," he said.

Starc five-for puts Australia in total control
DURBAN: The spin of Nathan Lyon and the reverse swing of Mitchell Starc sent South Africa crashing on the second day of the first Test against Australia at Kingsmead on Friday.
South Africa were bowled out for 162 shortly before the close, giving Australia a lead of 189 runs on the first innings.
Lyon started the slide for the hosts and finished with three for 50 before the tall left-armer Starc gave a magnificent display of fast, reverse swing bowling to take five for 34.
AB de Villiers played almost a lone hand for South Africa, making 71 not out.
Mitchell Marsh struck 96 for Australia. Largely through his efforts, as well as an aggressive innings of 35 by Starc, Australia's last three wickets added 100 runs to take them to a total of 351.
On a pitch which has proved even slower than predicted by both captains, left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj took five for 123 for South Africa.
Spin continued to be effective when South Africa batted. Off-spinner Lyon was brought on in the eighth over and took two wickets in his first over.
Starc used reverse swing bowled from around the wicket to make the ball move disconcertingly away from the right-handed batsmen before blasting out the last two batsmen, both left-handers, with full deliveries bowled from over the wicket.
Dean Elgar and Aiden Markram put on 27 for South Africa's first wicket and were looking reasonably comfortable until Australian captain Steve Smith brought Lyon into the attack in the eighth over. He had almost immediate success, catching Elgar off his own bowling with his second delivery. Three balls later he had Hashim Amla caught off bat and pad at short leg.
Markram (32) fended a short ball from Pat Cummins to give Cameron Bancroft a second catch at short leg to leave South Africa reeling at 55 for three at tea. De Villiers and captain Faf du Plessis batted confidently after tea, scoring freely off Lyon so that the spinner was taken off after a spell of two for 36 in ten overs.

Vets deployed to treat injured tuskers in herd brawl
Two groups of veterinary surgeons were deployed at the Yala National Park to treat three tuskers who have sustained injuries in their brawl, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Raveendra Samaraweera said.
He said the three were injured in their brawl due to harsh weather for the elephants in the park. He said the incident was reported in many media channels. These brawls are natural, but we have to attend to their health as we need to save tuskers, Minister Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations after assuming duties in his office yesterday morning at the Ministry in Sethsiripaya.
He said he was really pleased with his new position. He added that he had been appreciated as one of the oldest members of the UNP since he had been representing the Parliament since 1989. He said he belived he was appreciated for his patience because he remained without complaints though many young members get ministerial portfolios.
If I was not given this opportunity at this moment, what could I do Minister Samaraweera quetioned. Should I criticise my party I cant do it. If I dont agree, I shall have to leave. In such a way, I have set an example.
Questioned by the media personnel on the elephants seized from the temples, Minister Samaraweera said the complaint against them was they were caught from forests without permission. He said that around 30 such elephants were under the care of the government at Udawalawe. He said a decision would be made on them following the legal action.
Retaining those elephants is costly as around Rs 200,000 is spent on each per day, Minister Samaraweera said.
There is another complaint that they are not properly provided with food and facilities by those who have obtained the tenders.
The Minister said the would take measures to solve the human-elephant conflict, assuring water for the animals in the forests during the dry season.
He said the peoples issues have to be addressed keeping an eye on the wild animals rights as well.

South Africa, Wales to play one-off test :
Washington to host historic rugby match
South Africa and Wales' rugby sides will play a one-off test match at the RFK Stadium in Washington DC, it was announced.
The two nations will meet on June 2 at the 46,000-seater stadium, which was previously home to the Washington Redskins and, until last year, Major League Soccer team DC United.
The intention for both parties is to reach a new audience in a country where rugby's popularity continues to grow.
"The match in Washington allows us to take Springbok rugby to America and potentially expand the team's appeal to a very large audience," says Jurie Roux, head of the South Africa Rugby Union.
"Our research shows that the Springboks have a growing worldwide fan base and we see the match in Washington as an ideal platform to tap into a market that offers huge possibilities for South African rugby, in the exciting American sporting area."
The seven-a-side game has proved particularly popular in the US. The Las Vegas leg of the Sevens World Series has, in recent seasons, attracted over 80,000 spectators across three days of competition.
Sevens will get a further boost when San Francisco plays host to this year's World Cup in July.
Major League Rugby -- being billed as the highest level of American club rugby -- kicks off in 2018 and will feature seven teams in its inaugural season with an eighth to be added in 2019.
The match between South Africa and Wales will not be the first high-profile international to move state-side. Ireland and New Zealand met at Chicago's Soldier Field in front of a sold-out crowd of 61,000 in 2016. It was a game that saw Ireland overturn the All Blacks' 18-match unbeaten run.
"This is an exciting fixture for the WRU and for the national squad," says Welsh Rugby Union CEO Martyn Phillips. "It is a great opportunity to showcase Wales and our game in the capital of the United States.
"The opportunity to expand the already great Welsh support base and Welsh brand is very exciting for us, especially in such a large demographic and audience as the US."
Wales will then go on to face Argentina in Santa Fe and San Juan as part of the side's preparations for next year's World Cup in Japan.
The most recent encounter between South Africa and Wales was in Cardiff in December last year, with the hosts winning 24-22.
The Springboks have recently parted ways with coach Allister Coetzee, who led the side to just 11 wins in 25 games, and signed former player Rassie Erasmus on a five-year contract running until the 2023 World Cup. The two-time world champions sit sixth in the world rankings.
Wales, meanwhile, is one spot below its Southern Hemisphere rival. After a convincing victory over Scotland in the opening weekend of the on-going Six Nations Championship, it has fallen to defeats by England and Ireland in the two most recent rounds.  CNN

Weird rules of cricket you probably didn't know
Cricket like any sport has several rules, some are common others rarely come into use.
Most of the rules make sense, while there are some uncanny ones, for which we always wonder why do they exist.
Here we take a look at some of cricket's weird rules that most of you might not be aware of.
DHONI'S RUN OUT ATTEMPT GOES WRONG
During the ICC Champions Trophy 2017, Bangladesh were awarded 5 penalty runs against India, when Dhoni attempted to flick a ball at the stumps and the ball instead hit his glove, which was placed close to the stumps.
FORFEITING INNINGS OF A TEST MATCH
You can forfeit an entire innings of a Test.
One famous incident, that occurred in the past, was between England and South Africa in 2000. Rain played spoilsport and SA captain Hansie Cronje made an offer to England captain Nasser Hussain to chase down 249 in 76 overs. South Africa forfeited their second innings while England forfeited their first innings.
HANSIE CRONJE'S MATCH FIXING EPISODE
This Test match between South Africa and England is remembered for other reasons. The forfeiting of the innings turned out to be a match-fixing deal in which South Africa captain Hansie Cronje was involved with.
NOT OUT IF GLOVE IS NOT IN CONTACT WITH BAT
One of the rules of caught out in cricket states that a batsman cannot be ruled out if the ball hits the batsman on the glove and is caught but the hand or the glove is not in contact with the bat.  Newbytes
