Davis Cup hit by star pull outs
London Thursday: The Davis Cup quarter-finals take place this weekend but are missing the superstar pulling power of Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray and potentially overshadowed by Rafael Nadals last-ditch attempt to get to the Rio Olympics.
World number one Djokovic and newly crowned Wimbledon winner Murray had been expected to play in the quarter-final between Serbia and defending champions Great Britain.
But Djokovic pulled out of the tie after his shock Wimbledon third-round exit to Americas Sam Querrey, the Serbs earliest loss at a Grand Slam event in nine years.
Murray, the world number two, is still officially listed in the British team for the Friday-Sunday tie on outdoor clay in Belgrade.
However, the 29-year-old is expected to watch from the sidelines as he rests after his Wimbledon triumph and ahead of a packed summer schedule which includes the Olympics next month as well as the US Open.
Andy has to look after his body and his mind. Hes got his eyes set on getting some rest and really making a big push for the Olympics, US Open and beyond, Britain team captain Leon Smith told the BBC.
The British challenge will be led instead by world number 67 Kyle Edmund and the 240th-ranked James Ward.
In the absence of Djokovic and Serb number two Viktor Troicki, world number 81 Dusan Lajovic will lead 2010 champions Serbia.
Fourteen-time major winner Nadal and his Spanish team do not feature in the World Group quarter-finals, but the 30-year-old still faces a key weekend as he hears whether or not the International Tennis Federation (ITF) will give him the go-ahead to take part in Rio.
Nadal hasnt travelled to Romania for the Euro/Africa zone play-off as he continues to recover from a wrist injury which forced a withdrawal from the French Open and caused him to miss Wimbledon.
Nadal is keen to play in Rio after being unable to defend his gold medal at London in 2012 due to a knee injury but he hasnt fulfilled the qualifying criteria.
In other quarter-finals this weekend, Italy host Argentina in Pesaro.
Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open winner, is back in the Argentina squad after a four-year absence.
Federico Delbonis, the world number 40, is the South Americans top player while Fabio Fognini, ranked 36, leads Italys challenge.
Only once since returning to the World Group in 2002 have Argentina failed to have at least made the quarter-finals and that was in 2014 when Italy beat them in the first round.
In Trinec, the 2012 and 2013 champions Czech Republic face nine-time winners France, whose last title came in 2001.
The Czechs will miss their number one, eighth-ranked Wimbledon semi-finalist Tomas Berdych, while France will be led by 10th-ranked Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. France can also call upon Wimbledon doubles champions Nicolas Mahut and Pierre-Hugues Herbert.
The weekends remaining quarter-final sees 32-time champions United States host Croatia in Portland.
Both sides boast two top-20 players -- John Isner for the home side and former US Open champion Marin Cilic for 2005 champions Croatia.
Croatia have won all three of the nations previous ties, with Cilic also starring in the most recent encounter, a quarter-final in 2009.

Govt will not be allowed to take over SAITM: Bahu
Nawa Sama Samaja Party leader Dr. Wickramabahu Karunaratne said they would not give any opportunity to the government to take over SAITM.
Addressing a media briefing at the party headquarters yesterday, he said SAITM should be abolished and the administration of SAITM should take steps to award compensation to the students.
If the law of this country permits, a private degree institution like SAITM that does not follow the proper procedure, should be closed down. A serious question had arisen about the standards of SAITM. Even Professor Carlo Fonseka had alleged that SAITM had not developed its standards quantitatively and qualitatively. Therefore this garbage dump should be buried without being taken over by the government," Dr. Karunaratne said.
The same mistake was done in the past when the government took over the Ragama Medical College disregarding the free education received by the medical students. If the government takes over SAITM, it will pave the way for other fake degree offering private institutions to get official recognition despite the struggles by students and other parties for free education, he said.

Murali claims BCCI owes Mahela and him US$900,000
NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Indian Premier League can never be too far away from controversy.
The latest being legendary spinner Muthiah Muralitharans allegation that the Indian board still owes Mahela Jayawardene and him $500,000 and $400,000.
The issue of pending payments was re-ignited by Brad Hodge after Mohammed Shami was paid 2.2 crores for missing IPL 2016 due to injuries.
I see Mohammed Shami got compensated for injury during IPL in 2015 from BCCI. Any chance they can compensate the Kochi Tuskers players, the Aussie tweeted.
Kochi Tuskers were part of the cash-rich league in 2011, post which the franchise was terminated by the BCCI due to failure to submit bank guarantee.
Murali, Mahela, VVS Laxman and Ravindra Jadeja were some of the high-profile players in that team.
The BCCI still owes me $400,000, and Mahela, who was the captain of the team, $500,000. Ive written or spoken to the BCCI officials so many times in this regard, but despite many assurances on their part, nothing has happened. Overall, the BCCI owes the Kochi players more than $2 million. Were still waiting to get 40% of the money due to us, Muralitharan told Times of India.
The franchise paid us only 60% of our share, before asking us to take the remaining 40% from the BCCI, since they claimed that the board had kept their guarantee money with them.
Ive played in so many leagues around the world, but no board has done something like this. Like the players, the board too is supposed to honour a contract. It shows that they dont care for the players. Theyre just bothered with running the tournament.
BCCI however refuted Muralis charges, stating its for the franchise and not the board to pay these players. The Indian board further added that the matter was in court and players would be paid once the issue was legally resolved.  TOI

Shaun Marsh, Smith warm up for Tests with centuries
At an informal all-Australian practice two-day match at P Sara Stadium yesterday Shaun Marsh and captain Steve Smith scored centuries before retiring.
Opening the batting in the absence of David Warner (who remains affected by the fractured left index finger he sustained during the recent ODI tri-series in the West Indies), Marsh completed a solid, patient century in taxing humidity.
Against an opposing attack that featured the not-always-friendly firepower of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon and Moises Henriques as well as a handful of eager young bucks.
On a pitch that sported a tinge of green that  offered more encouragement to the quicks than the standard subcontinent deck.
Joe Burns might have been the only specialist Test batsman to lose his wicket across 90 overs yesterday  caught behind for nine when trying to squeeze a wide, yorker-length delivery from Starc through point  but his place in the starting XI for the first Test starting at Kandy on July 26 is not in doubt.
Marsh can make an even stronger case for a Test recall in next weeks marginally more formal three-day tour match against an as-yet-unnamed Sri Lanka Cricket Board XI at the same venue in Colombos inner-east.
Where Warner will once again be sidelined having only returned to shadow batting in the nets yesterday and filling various roles as 12th man, umpire and beyond-the-rope outfielder during the 89 overs in which Smiths XI posted 4/389 against the side captain by Adam Voges.
The vice-captains absence is likely to be the only anomaly between the team that takes to the lush P Sara field for that game and the XI for the first of the three Tests against a largely unheralded and equally under-rated Sri Lanka.
Australias most potent paceman Mitchell Starc, impressed in his first competitive red-ball hit-out since major ankle surgery last November.
After dismissing Burns, he welcomed his Test captain Steve Smith to the crease with a steepling bounced followed by an even more menacing short ball into the captains ribs.
Starc finished with three of the four wickets to fall to bowlers  Shaun Marsh and Smith both retired from the middle upon reaching their respective centuries  and rattled the stumps of National Performance Squad member Hilton Cartwright and fellow fast bowling cartel member Nathan Coulter-Nile.
He showed his stamina wont be an issue in the enervating post-monsoonal heat despite his extended lay-off, sending a bouncer sailing over keeper Peter Nevills head for four byes with the second new ball late in the day.
But even though the pitch offered good carry when the ball was hard and shiny and a few jumped off a length, it often yielded more tennis ball bounce that meant those batsmen who got going  Smith, Marsh and his younger brother Mitchell (77 no)  were able to cash in.
Certainly there was slow turn but little else on offer for the spinners, with Lyon, highly-rated young wrist spinner Mitchell Swepson and his fellow leggie Arjun Nair all copping punishment when they dropped short and the ball sat up, asking to be hit.
Its unlikely that will change drastically tomorrow when Steve OKeefe will have the chance to push his claims for the role of second spinner in the upcoming Test series, bowling to the likes of Voges, Khawaja and Nevill in this faux fixture.

Sudath Sampath to coach U-20, Womens Sevens teams
Former Isipathana and Sri Lanka Sevens rugby skipper and Police SC, CR & FC and CH & FC rugby coach Sudath Sampath has been entrusted with the task of coaching the Sri Lanka Womens national rugby Sevens as well as the Sri Lanka national Mens Under 20 rugby Sevens teams with immediate effect.
Sampath is known to be one of the best ever Sevens players produced by the country and came into the national rugby team in 1990 where he turned out for the Sicily Sevens in Italy at the age of 20.
Sampath who is more famously known as the Little Serevi of Sri Lankan rugby was a complete treat to watch in full flow and can make any opposition look like mere spectators with his nippy footwork and quick breaks.
He is currently with the CH and FC team as the assistant coach and had a good season this year from the second round onwards in the Dialog inter-club league rugby tournament ending up with some spirited performances.
Sampath is a level 2 qualified rugby coach, hence is an interesting addition to the national ranks.
Meanwhile Army officer (female) W.D.P.I. Thilakawardena and ex-Thomian rugby player Jayan Goonetilake has been appointed as managers of the National womens and Under 20 rugby teams respectively.
Nazim Mohamad, secretary of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union (SLRFU) officially confirmed all the appointments.

Pakistan 282-6 against England at first day close
LONDON, THURSDAY: Pakistan were 282 for six after winning the toss at stumps on the first day of the first Test against England at Lords on Thursday.
Misbah-ul-Haq, who in the course of his innings became the oldest Test centurion in 82 years, was 110 not after Rahat Ali was bowled by Chris Woakes off what became the last ball of the day.
Warwickshire all-rounder Woakes led Englands attack with four for 45.
This is the first of a four-Test series.
The first hour saw Hafeez and Masood put on a 38-run stand that involved a little bit of luck alongside some proactive batting.
Hafeez might have been taken on 11, when a drive at Broad resulted in a thick edge low to the left of James Vince at third slip but he could not hold on one-handed.
The same batsman flashed wide of the slips off Ball in the 10th over and Masood followed suit, off Woakes, moments after.
Woakes, though, found success shortly before the drinks break, inducing a thin edge from Masood with a delivery than bounced a touch more than expected.
The elegant-looking left-hander is well acquainted with the surroundings at Lords, having grown up around the corner in St Johns Wood, but he was unable to linger in the middle long enough to truly enjoy himself.
Hafeez gambolled his way to 40 before finally falling in lackadaisical fashion, trying to flip Woakes across the line only to offer a straightforward catch to Jonny Bairstow running across towards square leg, but Youniss presence at the crease, springing cat-like into line 15 years after his last appearance at Lords, hinted at the work to come for the bowlers.
