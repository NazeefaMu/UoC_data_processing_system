Buddhist perspective to conflict resolution
Conflict resolution is a popular subject of discussion in the world today. It is a topic widely discussed in the university as well as among intellectuals. Sources and examples in field are mainly found in the Western world.
During the civil war in Sri Lanka and during communal conflicts, international peacemakers or aids suppliers brought examples from the West. However, many have forgotten that Sri Lanka is a country which has a long history with a Buddhist way of life that lasted 2,500 years and more. Recalling this, Rev. Fr. Sarath Hettiarachchi, born and bred on Sri Lankan soil, and having received higher education in Sri Lanka, discusses conflict resolution methods by referring to the "Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories" in his book Pansiya Panas Jathaka Potha saha Gatum Nirakaranaya. Rev. Fr., thus, has made us proud.
Being a son of a Buddhist father and a Christian mother, he has natural claim by birth to embrace religious co-existence. He obtained his first degree from Peradeniya University, Master of Arts and PhD from Kelaniya University, and Theological Degree from Serampo College in India. I recognized him as an intellectual and analyst of the book "Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories." He is the only Christian Father in Sri Lanka who has done a study of the book in a sociological angle for his PhD. Most intellectuals are confined to their subject of academic study, but Father Hettiarachchi is different, as he does not confine himself to only books. He stood neck-and-neck with me and other monks, and worked together to see an end to the war during that dark period of three decades.
Ignoring ones own conveniences and going through thick forests of Vavuniya and visiting other places such as Madu Church, Malavi, LTTE Headquarters in Kilinochchi, and University of Jaffna, we, together, conducted discussions with the army personnel with the prime aim of stopping bloodshed among our people and to create a peaceful country for all. During the last few days of the war, Rev. Fr. Hettiarchchi and I, together, got into a military tank and proceeded to the battlefield to provide moral support to the three forces, risking our lives.
In writing his book titled The Book of Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories and Conflict Resolution, it is clear that the writer has obtained all necessary material from books and other relevant sources as well as from life experiences, which, in my view, have contributed to the success of this creative work. This is the first time that a Sri Lankan Christian Father has written a sociological book on the book of Five Hundred and Fifty Jathaka Stories, but there is something more about this. My friend, Sirisumana Godage, invited Rev. Fr. Hettiarachchi to launch this book for a special reason.
Father Sarath Hettiarachchi is at present, suffering from a blood cancer disease called Multiple Myeloma. According to medical advice, this is incurable, and the cost of medicine and treatment is high. However, he attended to all matters pertaining to the book by himself while either being bedridden or hospitalized, fighting all kinds of aches and pains, and bearing them up fearlessly and courageously.
When he was working hard to develop religious co-existing among people, he had to suffer immensely. Many criticized him and caused him a lot of problems. A majority of them belongs to the same faith as his. Yet he had enough courage to face such attacks although his younger sister also became a victim to a train bomb. He continued to carry out discussions with the LTTE leaders for peace because he had such intrinsic courage within him.
From his sickbed, he completed his book. It will be launched as a Godage Publication on March 31, at 4.30 pm, at the Colombo Public Library Auditorium. The revenue earned from this book will be used to meet the medical expenses of Rev. Fr. Hettiarachchi. Political leaders, artists, ambassadors, and a large number of intellectuals are expected to attend this function.
We invite all friends of Rev. Fr. Sarath Hettiarachchi, belonging to all faiths, to be present at Colombo Public Library Auditorium on March 31, at 4.15 pm. Further information can be obtained by calling 071-8220910 or 071-0907801. Let us wish Rev Father Sarath Hettiarachchi, Theruwan Saranai.

Case against Tissa Attanayake : Fifteen witnesses including President, PM to appear in Court today
Fifteen prosecution witnesses including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are to appear before Colombo High Court today (20) to testify in the case against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election for the purpose of affecting the results of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
On December 5, 2016, the Colombo High Court had issued summons on 15 witnesses including the President and Prime Minister to give evidence as the prosecution witnesses in the case.
UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake had been arrested and held in remand custody for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last Presidential Election with the intention of inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities. He is currently out on bail.
The accused had been charged under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007. This is the first time in Sri Lanka that an accused had been indicted in the High Court by the Attorney General for an offence that comes under the ICCPR Act. Additional Solicitor General Wasantha Navaratne Bandara PC with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama are to lead evidence on behalf of the Attorney General.
The Attorney General alleged that Tissa Attanayake had publicly announced on December 22, 2014 that there was a secret agreement between the then Common Opposition Candidate Maithripala Sirisena and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Attorney General alleged Tissa Attanayake committed an offence under Section 3(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Act No. 56 of 2007 by inciting racial or religious hatred among ethnic communities.
Section 3(1) of the ICCPR cites that no person shall propagate war or advocate national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to cause discrimination, hostility or violence.
The AG further alleged that Tissa Attanayake had committed a punishable offence under Sections 454 and 459 of the Penal Code by forging a document and displaying it to the public as genuine and that the accused had also committed an offence under Section 80-C of the Presidential Election Act for displaying a fake document prior to an election, for the purpose of affecting the result of that election in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate. The AG has listed 15 persons including President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as witnesses in the case.

Casemiro guides leaders Real through Athletic test
BARCELONA, Saturday -Real Madrid went five points clear a the top of La Liga after coming through a testing game at Athletic Bilbao to win 2-1 thanks to Brazilian midfield lynchpin Casemiro's strike on Saturday.
Karim Benzema fired Real ahead in the 25th minute with an exquisite first-time finish from a Cristiano Ronaldo cross after Casemiro had begun the move with a clever long ball from the halfway line.
Athletic worked hard to get back into the game and, after Real keeper Keylor Navas produced a brilliant save to deny Inaki Williams, veteran striker Aritz Aduriz headed the home side level from close range in the 65th minute.
Casemiro restored Real's lead in the 68th, however, by controlling a Ronaldo's flicked header from a corner and calmly taking his time to tuck the ball into the net from close range thanks to some careless defending. Real lead on 65 points from second-placed Barcelona, who have also played 27 games and host Valencia on Sunday.  Agencies

Cheese gets a miniature house
This hamster has its own house and even holds its personalised spoon and bowl while eating. Cheese, the dwarf hamster is owned by Tiffany Zhang, 29, from Manchester, who created a hamster house and trained Cheese to use utensils on her own.
The cute pet has her own bedroom, furniture, and eating gear for snacks. The house has its own stairs, rooms, and bed for Cheese to nap or eat in different areas. Tiffany insists that Cheese even cleans up her own bedroom on a regular basis.
She said: "I've had Cheese for about 16 months and she's unlike any pet I've had. She cleans her own bedroom regularly by throwing out everything she doesn't want in there, mainly her own poops. When she's on her own during the day, she sleeps, eats, digs, cleans her bedroom and grooms herself a lot. She's very adaptable and smart when it comes to the food that she loves, that's how I managed to get her used to eating yogurt while holding mini spoons or bowls herself.
Tiffany added: "I bought a DIY dolls house set from a craft shop and put the house together, then it took me a while to source the furniture which is not only reasonably priced but also the right size for a dwarf hamster. I eventually found some flat pack furniture from eBay which was just about the right size to fit in the house.
The mini cushions, plates, spoons, and bowls are from Japan, I bought them during my last trip to Tokyo because I collect toys and designer collectibles myself, plus I thought it would be a good size for a dwarf hamster." Mirror

Chelsea march on, Arsenal's Wenger to reveal his future after loss
LONDON, Saturday - Chelsea continued their seemingly irresistible surge towards regaining the Premier League title as a late Gary Cahill goal saw them snatch a 2-1 win at Stoke City on Saturday to move a provisional 13 points clear at the top.
The latest triumph for Antonio Conte's unstoppable charges came after London rivals Arsenal's season continued to unravel with a third straight 3-1 away league defeat, this time at West Bromwich Albion.
The Gunners fourth loss in five league games raised further questions about the future of under-pressure manager Arsene Wenger, who announced intriguingly afterwards: I know what I will do. You will soon know.
Conte had been without the in-form Eden Hazard through injury for what always promised to be an awkward fixture for Chelsea at Stoke and, just as they had recently held Manchester City at home, the Potters again made life difficult.
Willian put the leaders ahead after 13 minutes thanks to a blunder by Stoke goalkeeper Lee Grant but Jon Walters equalised with a penalty before halftime after being fouled by Cahill.
The England defender made amends in the 87th minute with a deserved winner and, after Phil Bardsley had been sent off for Stoke in added time, Conte celebrated with his staff on the touchline as Chelsea moved on to 69 points, leaving all the pressure on their nearest pursuers who play on Sunday.
Second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who host Southampton, and third-placed Manchester City, who welcome fourth-placed Liverpool to the Etihad Stadium, now both have to win just to get back within 10 points of the leaders.
Arsenal's defeat came amid more protests from some of the more vociferous of the Gunners faithful about Wenger as the manager acknowledged that his side were in the middle of a unique bad patch in his two-decade managerial reign.
After dismal defending saw West Brom's Craig Dawson head home twice from corners in a convincing win for Tony Pulis's men, Wenger told reporters: We lose game after game at the moment and that for me is much more important than my future.
Yet as the debates about his prospects became ever louder -- one airplane trailed a banner over the ground that declared Wenger Out while another trumpeted In Arsene We Trust -- the Frenchman said he would clarify his future soon.
His team, though, now look in serious jeopardy of not enjoying a 20th successive season of Champions League football in 2017-18 -- and if Manchester United win at Middlesbrough on Sunday, Arsenal, currently fifth on 50 points, will drop to sixth, two points behind Jose Mourinho's men.
Basement club Sunderland were held 0-0 at home to poor travellers Burnley, while third-bottom Hull City were trounced 4-0 by Everton, for whom league-leading scorer Romelu Lukaku scored twice in added time, taking his season's tally to 21.
The Belgian became the first Toffees striker to hit 20 league goals in a season, since Gary Lineker 31 years ago, though his goals were bitter-sweet for Everton fans who know he could leave after this week rejecting a new contract offer.
Leicester City's remarkable resurgence under new manager Craig Shakespeare continued with a fourth successive win under his stewardship since Claudio Ranieri's sacking.
The champions won 3-2 at West Ham United with first-half goals from Riyad Mahrez, Robert Huth and Jamie Vardy for their first league success away from home all season.
Shakespeare, the first Premier League manager to oversee a side scoring three goals in his first three matches in charge, was intensely proud of the results his players had gleaned.
Like Leicester, Crystal Palace eased their worries with a third straight win, 1-0 at home to Watford through Troy Deeney's own goal, suggesting master escapologist Sam Allardyce can maintain his record of never suffering a Premier League relegation.
After Swansea City's recent revival under Paul Clement was checked with a 2-0 defeat at Bournemouth in the late game, the bottom five teams are now Sunderland on 20 points, Middlesbrough 22, Hull 24, Swansea 27 and Crystal Palace 28.  Agencies

Chinese Defense Chief arrives in Sri Lanka

Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanquan and a delegation of twenty-one members has arrived in Sri Lanka for an official visit.
He will visit Nepal next.
China has also invested heavily in Sri Lanka, funding airports, roads, railways and ports, and including the island nation of 21 million people on its "One Belt, One Road" mission to create a modern-day "Silk Road" across Asia.
China is vying to increase its influence in Nepal, which serves as a natural buffer between China and India, challenging India's long-held position as the dominant outside power in the landlocked nation.

The ministry, in a short statement, said Deputy Naval Chief Su Zhiqian would accompany Minister Chang.
China's Defense Ministry said in December that China would hold its first military drills with Nepal in 2017.
In 2014, Sri Lanka allowed a Chinese submarine and a warship to dock at its port in the capital Colombo, prompting concern in New Delhi.
India, which has a festering border dispute with China, has looked at the latter's strategic ambitions in South Asia and in the Indian Ocean with some nervousness.
China has close defence ties with India's long-time rival Pakistan, and has been getting closer to Bangladesh and the Maldives too.
Chinese warships now increasingly drill in the Indian Ocean too, as Beijing becomes more confident about projecting power far from its shores.

Right supervision of student discipline
The student conduct should first be examined by looking at the relevant environment. This is an essential requirement to understand the student behaviour. The analysis must be supported by an assessment of the environmental influence.
The influence can vary, depending on the societal expectations of universities as well as colleges.
For that we must shift into the in loco parentis perspective.
The term in loco parentis, which in Latin means in the place of a parent refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organisation to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent.
It allows institutions such as colleges and schools to act in the best interests of the students as they see fit, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students civil liberties.
We should focus more on entrusting leadership with students, which has been lacking so far.
Such a paradigm shift may reinforce proper discipline, a fundamental requirement of any educational institute.
Over to you Education Minister and other authoritative personnel who can take decisions on the countrys education.

Country needs politicians with a back-bone: President
President Maithripala Sirisena stressed that the country needs to have patriotic politicians with a strong backbone instead of yes-men or henchmen.
The President added that the type of politicians required for the country should be forthright and should not accept everything without any positive argument.
The type of politicians that the country needs should not say Yes to everything but must have the courage to point out any shortcomings, the President added.
President Sirisena was speaking at the SLFP headquarters after opening a political academy of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front yesterday.
The political academy aims to train young politicians so as to empower them to take the country forward.
"Measures were taken to commence this academy since there is a timely need to have a proper political knowledge driven force," the President said.
"The main hindrance and challenge in creating such a pure and clean political force is the nonavailability of experienced and well-versed politicians. At this juncture the new political academy will play a pivotal role in the country's political arena in the future, President Sirisena said.
He added that every young SLFP politician should get a thorough knowledge about the history of the SLFP.

Court issues arrest warrant on Dhammaloka Thera

Colombo Additional Magistrate yesterday issued a warrant for the arrest of Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka thera of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda for not appearing in Court on two occasions over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner of causing nuisance.
When case came up before Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe, Dhammaloka thera was not present in Court and the Additional Magistrate was compelled to issue warrants against the Thera.
Further magisterial inquiry put off for April 5.
On December 6, 2016 the Court issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera from using loudspeakers in a manner of causing nuisance at Siri Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m.
The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka at Siri Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr.Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Halok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Siri Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple.
They said the authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions. Senior Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Counsel Sudath Atapattu appeared for the Centre for Environmental Justice.

Deeney own goal lifts Palace out of relegation zone
LONDON, Saturday - An own goal from Watford captain Troy Deeney handed Crystal Palace a vital 1-0 win in the Premier League at Selhurst Park on Saturday.
A big penalty shout from Palace within the opening 10 minutes of a scrappy first half was turned down by referee Martin Atkinson after winger Wilfried Zaha appeared to have been pushed down by Craig Cathcart in Watford's penalty area.
Deeney's horror moment came in the 68th minute after Yohan Cabaye swung a free-kick into the Watford box, which should have been easily dealt with by their skipper, but the striker diverted the ball into the bottom corner.
The victory lifted Palace to 16th in the table, four points above the relegation zone, while Watford remain 13th.

DFCC Bank releases  concise Annual Report
DFCC Bank continued its revolutionary approach to presenting its annual report in a comprehensive yet concise format, in line with global trends.
This concise approach to reporting enables the Bank to reduce its carbon footprint while at the same time making the report user-friendly for stakeholders.
Almost half the size of customary Annual Reports, this report balances the need to communicate effectively through concise, relevant information while at the same time providing comprehensive compliance-related disclosures. DFCC Bank has drawn on concepts, principles and guidance from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Sustainability Guidelines G4, the International Integrated Reporting Framework and the Smart Integrated Reporting Methodology in producing this report.
The theme for this years report is Growth At Our Core which is in line with the Banks brand promise - Keep Growing. This concept is visually represented using a cross section of a tree trunk. Each year, a tree forms new cells, arranged in concentric circles called annual rings or annual growth rings. These annual rings show the amount of wood produced during one growing season. Thus, the tree trunk cross section featured in the report shows 62 growth rings representing DFCC Banks journey.
The report is presented in three formats which include a concise report in print and CD formats, a comprehensive report available online (https://dfcc2016.annualreports.lk) and a condensed annual snapshot in print and pdf formats that communicates across a broad spectrum of current and potential stakeholders.
The Bank also launched a Perennial Compendium in 2015. \The Perennial Compendium is linked to DFCC Banks website and presents the latest news categorised under Messages, Business Model, Value Creation and Capital Formation and Reports and Notices, based on the integrated reporting guidelines. This Compendium is also replicated in an investor relations app format which can be downloaded via App store or Google Play. Through this, stakeholders globally can stay up-to-date 24/7 on the Banks developments through their smart devices, which are synced to real time updates.
The Banks forward thinking brand personality is uniquely captured and embedded in the presentation of this annual report,DFCC Bank CEO Arjun Fernando said. Staying on par with DFCCs increasingly tech-savvy stakeholder base is an imperative, as they are increasingly migrating to mobile devices to view content and engage with the Bank.
This is part of the journey of adding value to the stakeholder experience, in line with DFCCs new brand promise, which is to Keep Growing.

Dispensers will be absorbed as pharmacists, and a system will be formulated to promote them, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. <U+200B>
Midwives will be given opportunities to enter into the nursing service, he said. The Minister was addressing a ceremony held in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said steps will be taken to make changes with the support of trade unions. "I am facing various problems because I reduced the prices of drugs. Now the drug mafia is creating problems. Drug companies do not assist doctors' organisations," he said. Some get disturbed when they do not receive any benefits.

Elite squad under former Military Intelligence Director killed Lasantha: CID
Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka told the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) that an elite squad operating under former Military Intelligence Director Major General Kapila Hendawitharana had killed former Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga, CID told Court today.
It was the same elite squad that had carried out the attacks on former Rivira Editor Upali Tennekoon, and former Nation Deputy Editor Keith Noyahr, the CID quoted Field Marshall Fonseka as having said in a statement to the CID.
Field Marshall Fonseka had further told the CID retired Major General Ajith Perera had been in charge of affairs relating to Colombo and the suburbs at the time.
Wickremetunga was killed en route to work on January 8, 2019. His murder was widely condemned. In a posthumous editorial the former Editor of the Sunday Leader held former President Mahinda Rajapaksa responsible for his death.
Former Rivira Editor Upali Tennekoon was attacked no less that two weeks Lasantha was murdered. Tennekoon, who escaped the assault, left the country, as did Keith Noyahr who was abducted and assaulted in May 2008. The cases saw little progress under the last regime but have been actively pursued under the present government.
Wickremetungas body was exhumed in September last year, and the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) of the Police told Court today the most recent postmortem results had revealed that Wickremetunga had died as a result of an sharp instrument being inserted into his head, and not by shooting as believed earlier.

Etisalat named most  valuable Telecoms Brand Portfolio for 2017 by Brand Finance
Etisalat is recognised as the most valuable of any telecoms brand portfolio in the Middle East by leading London based brand valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance. This recognition was mainly due to its focused programme on brand activities, management of significant global sponsorship properties and local events targeted at both consumer and business customers as well as the increased revenues has contributed to the brand value.
Etisalat headquartered in UAE has its brand presence in Egypt, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan, the company has ownership stakes in Mobily in KSA, Ufone and PTCL in Pakistan, and Maroc Telecom and Moov brands in Africa. At a value of US$ 7,728bn, this places the Etisalat Group portfolio a comfortable US$ 1.5bn ahead of second-placed telco.
A key contribution to this result was an increase in the strength of its flagship brand, Etisalat, jumping from a rating of AA- last year to AA+ for 2017. This is the first time the consulting firm has evaluated a brand based on its portfolio. Etisalat Group was also assessed on its focussed programme of brand activities, mainly comprising of the management of significant global sponsorship properties such as FC Barcelona, as well as local events targeted at both consumer and business customers.
Brand Finance values thousands of brands annually to compile its Global 500 and Telecoms 500 listings, as well as numerous other sector, region and individual market league tables.
Commenting on Etisalat s strategy, Brand Finance CEO David Haigh said: As well as developing its core brand, Etisalat has pursued a broader brand portfolio strategy to build business value through leveraging branded assets. Brands such as Mobily in Saudi Arabia provide access to very significant GCC markets and in addition, the portfolio approach has provided a foothold in key regional territories adjacent to the Middle East base - for example through Maroc Telecom in North Africa and in Pakistan. The latter gives the opportunity for branded development of a broader converged proposition, involving mobile and fixed line operators Ufone and PTCL. This brand portfolio strategy opens up a range of opportunities in the future to use brand as a means of growing further business value.

CanHOPE patient care event titled Experience the Journey within was held to familiarize the regional journalists with what patients may experience during treatment and how to cope with the treatment process.
Founded in 2006, Singapores PCC which is known for its holistic approach in healing, touching and caring for patients, is one of the largest and leading private cancer centres in the country. CanHOPE is a non-profit cancer counselling and support service initiated by PCC.
CanHOPE works closely with the medical doctors, nursing staff, counsellors and other associated health professionals, offering a vast range of resources and information about cancer, while helping patients and their caregivers to make effective, informed decisions in their treatment journey.
The panel
The services provided by CanHOPE are cancer counselling, rehabilitation, educational programmes and nutrition (Nutrition screening, individual dietary counselling, nutrition workshops, Cooking classes and resource development.) Through CanHOPE, PCC strives to inspire hope in their patients and their loved ones by helping them better cope with cancer.
PCC Vice President Yeo Kim Seck in his welcome address explained the importance of the centre as a comprehensive and integrated one providing the best premiere cancer care.
Just like the conductor directs the entire Orchestra, the PCC guides the patient throughout the treatment process which starts with a cancer diagnosis.
The PCC is one that provides all required treatment whether it is chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery.
He noted that it is of utmost importance to pay vital attention to cancer not only because it is the leading cause of death worldwide, but also because suffering from the disease is a devastating, emotional and painful journey for patients and his/her family/loved ones.
The other speakers were Nurse Manager PCC Tay Sok Har, Counsellor Dominica Chua, Manager, Allied Health Fahma Sunarja, Senior Palliative Care Nurse Zhang Liting, Senior Executive, Services Operations Dianah Awaludin, Senior Counselor Paula Rusly and Senior Dietician Gerard Wong.
Cancer diagnosis and cancer treatment do not merely affect the physical condition, but evoke a wide range of feelings that most people are not accustomed to deal with, the panel noted.
Manager, Allied Health Fahma Sunarja in her speech nutritional Guide during cancer treatment explained the goals of Canhopes nutritional care. The centre with its early nutritional assessment identifies those at risk. It provides aggressive nutrition support in the form of oral nutrition intake and nutrition supplementation and methods to prevent nutritional deficiencies, she said.
The centre is highly concerned about the food intake of the patients during the entire treatment process. As the nutritionist noted patients are educated on topics such as food safety.
They should avoid raw foods such as sashmi, med-rare beef etc), avoid adding spices, codiments after cooking, runny eggs, shellfish ( cockles, clams), raw vegetables, food peels, salad dressing when eating out and most importantly ready- to- eat food that has been prepared many hours ahead, she added.
Art Therapy
Art therapy too is used to expedite the healing process. Senior Counsellor Paula Rusly, defined this therapy as a form of psychotherapy that can be helpful to people who are struggling with difficult and challenging situations such as cancer diagnosis.
She explained how this method is used by patients of various ages undergoing treatment at the PCC to express their emotions. The patients do not need to have any previous experience or expertise in art in order to join in or benefit from an art therapy session.
Senior dietician Gerard Wong noted there is a strong link between being overweight or obese and be at an increased risk of 11 cancers such as liver, advanced prostrate, ovarian, gallbladder , kidney, colorectal (bowel), oesophageal, postmenopausal breast, pancreatic, endometrial (womb)and stomach (cardia.)
He further noted that 1.9 billion adults worldwide are overweight or obese and this exceeds the population of China. Physical inactivity is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, he noted.
The PCC being always optimistic wants everybody affected by cancer to hope for the best without getting discouraged. As PCC Marketing Manager Max Tan finally reassured the PCC team works hard as ever to deliver holistic cancer care in a safe and soothing environment, well aided by the latest technologies and proven innovative therapies to achieve optimal clinical outcomes for its patients.

FCID seeks to rescind the auction
The Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) of the Police will go before the Pugoda Magistrate today to put off the earlier decision of the court to auction the controversial Malwana land.
The court on an earlier occasion decided to auction the land and also published press notices fixing the date for March 29.
It was the public perception that the land in question is alleged to have been owned by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa and businessman Tirukumar Nadesan.
However, both the individuals during the case asserted that they did not own it. A third party also denied any ownership of the land prompting the court to take a decision to sell the land at a public auction after a proper valuation.
The government valuer had accordingly valued the land at Rs 208 million.
When the matter came up for discussion before the Cabinet recently, it was decided to stop the auction and acquire the land for a public purpose or to set up a police training academy. The decision was taken to avoid intimidation by interested parties during the auction and thereafter, and that the land would be taken back in the event of a change of government.
Highly placed government sources said if somebody does not own a land and if there were no legal claimants, such land would be the property of the government, according to the provisions of the Crown Land Act.

France sinks Wales after chaotic and extended rugby finale
PARIS, Saturday - France beat Wales 20-18 thanks to a converted try by Damien Chouly 20 minutes after full time had elapsed following an extraordinary and chaotic finale to their Six Nations match on Saturday.
The clock showed 99 minutes and 55 seconds when replacement flanker Chouly dotted the ball down after nine penalty scrums, and Camille Lopez slotted over the conversion as France saved, like Wales, their place in the second pot ahead of the 2019 World Cup draw.
France ended the championship in third place with Wales finishing fifth.
Wales had victory in their sights when Leigh Halfpenny's sixth penalty gave them a 18-13 lead but France won a five-metre penalty scrum with one minute left. Eight scrums later, after Wales prop Samson Lee was shown a yellow card and a series of controversial incidents including a biting allegation, France finally got over the line for the second time.
I'm an old man but I had never seen anything like this, said France coach Guy Noves, who responded angrily to a reporter suggesting Wales winger George North had been bitten in stoppage time.
Noves bit his hand and said: Look, there's a bite mark, here.
There was also confusion surrounding late replacements with France prop Uini Atonio being substituted by Rabah Slimani. I was told he was injured so I took my responsibilities, said Noves when asked if the substitution was tactical.  Agencies

Having children could increase your lifespan
For some people, having kids is a no-brainer. For others, however, its a less easy decision to make. But if youre looking for a way to live longer, new findings may just help you make a decision.
A study has found that parents live longer than their childless counterparts. This is despite the fact that most parents joke about the trials and tribulations of bringing up kids shaving years off their lives.
The report from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm found that once you reach the age of 60, men and women live longer if they have at least one child.
The researchers used Swedish census data from over 1.4 million men and women born between the years of 1911 and 1925 to draw their conclusions.
They discovered that on average, fathers live 20.2 years past the age of 60, compared to 18.4 years for childless men. For women, mothers are expected to live 24.6 years past 60, 1.5 years longer than childless women. Unintentionally terrifying childrens movies
The researchers gave this example: The one year risk of death for an 80 year old man with a child was 7.4 per cent, compared with 8.3 per cent for a childless man of the same age. Interestingly, the study found that when men were divided into married and unmarried as well as childless and fathers, the unmarried men had a greater death risk: the difference in death risk was 1.2 per cent among unmarried men and 0.6 per cent among those who were married.
Unmarried men might be relying more heavily on their children in the absence of a partner by way of a possible explanation, the study authors suggested.
They are also likely to be less well educated, whereas the opposite tends to be true of women.
While other studies have found that parents of daughters live longer than those who have sons, the latest study concluded that the sex of the children makes no difference. The researchers admit that no firm conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn, but they say: Our finding that the association grew stronger when parents became older is further in agreement with research suggesting that childless people face support deficits only towards the end of life.

Nordqvist went out in the afternoon at the Wildfire Golf Club and started quickly with a five-under par, 31 on her first nine holes. She played college golf in Arizona so feels at home on this course.
They always say that home is where the heart is, and my heart is definitely still here, said Nordqvist. Even though I live in Florida now, this definitely feels like home. I have family and friends here, or seem like family. So I was staying with friends this week. It's just been a fun week.

Indias  Inspriedge to create IT smart village in  East
An Indian IT company is looking to create a smart village in the eastern province along with the Eastern Provincial Council, a first such initiative in the region.
CEO, Inspriedge, Sumit Bothra who met the Chief Minister, Eastern Province, Nasser Ahamed in Batticaloe yesterday said that they are now in the process of identifying a small village and clearing the red tape. This is not a huge investment but what is needed is to get the IT infrastructure in to place.
He said that the idea in this regard was first talked at the Invest in East forum which was held in Colombo late last year. We then drew up a plan which is now in the implementation stage.
Explaining further he said that the proposed village will be firstly installed with free WIFI where households would be able to move in to an era where they would be communication more closely via smart phones and tablets.
Next all government institutions where they have dealings with villages like Water Board, Electricity Board, Municipality would be linked to each other via their existing accounts. This will enable all villages to pay their bills check their usage all via the smart phones. We hope the banks within this proposed Smart village too would use this and create their own platforms to do mobile banking, he said.
Bothra also said that one of the key points that prompted them to select Sri Lanka was the announcement by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that the government was keen to move in to a digital era.
Taiwanese Dr. Michael Ho, Director, Inspriedge, who is a key partner in this project in India and other countries said that the people can use this technology to get advanced reading on weather patterns and even fishermen could use this technology to identify areas where there is a lot fish and also communicate with buyers. Basically they catch the fish and before they return they can sell their catch via mobile smart banking, Ho said. He said that the private sector can join with them and take this technology form them and implement it. They could cover their cost with advertising and also through commissions during transactions of uses. This is now happening all over the world and its the future which we are bringing in.
Ho said with the installation of camera it will also reduce the crime rate, accidents and even a bus time tables could be displayed on bus stations in the future.
Another key area where the proposed smart village could benefit is education.

India to introduce plastic Rs. 10 notes
Five cities across India with diverse geographical and climatic conditions will be the first to start using plastic bank notes of 10 denomination,
with the centre approving a field trial. The notes are considered to be cleaner than paper currency, will last longer and are difficult to counterfeit.
The Finance Ministry has asked the Reserve Bank of India to go ahead with the procurement of the requisite plastic substrate material and approved the printing of Rs.10 notes, Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal told Parliament on Friday. Plastic bank notes are expected to last longer than cotton substrate-based ones, Meghwal said. Over the years, central banks across the world have been exploring different solutions for extending the life cycle of bank notes. These include introduction of plastic ones and other developments in substrates for enhancing durability including use of natural fibre blends andvarnish, he pointed out.
The RBI has been planning the introduction of plastic notes for a while.Under the previous UPA government, Parliament was told in February 2014 about a plan to print one billion plastic notes of 10 denomination for a field trial. http://www.thehindu.com

Kalpitiya reef under threat
The Bar Reef in Kalpitiya, which was hit for the second time by a severe coral bleaching event last year, since 1998, is under threat of destruction posing a severe risk to fishing resources, Marine Environmental Specialists cautioned.
IUCN Coastal and Marine Programme Coordinator Arjan Rajasuriya pointed out that most of the fish could disappear when the corals get affected, thereby affecting the fisheries industry.
This will lead to fishermen resorting to destructive fishing methods. Even now we could see them laying nets on the damaged reef causing further damage, he said.Rajasuriya, who examined the Bar Reef last week, told the Daily News that almost 99 percent of the corals in shallow waters to a depth of about 5-6 metres were dead following the El Nio and La Nia effect in 2015-2016.
It will take at least 15-20 years for the destroyed corals to come back, but only if this bleaching occurrence did not take place repeatedly. However, with climate change, it is likely that these occurrences may happen regularly, said Rajasuriya, who was a former Research Officer at NARA specialized in coral taxonomy.
He noted that the restoration of coral beds by replanting is not possible, given the large scale destruction. When acres and acres are destroyed, how are you going to restore, and where are you going to get live corals to do that he questioned.
He said the countrys coral beds were affected during the La Nia period which happened about six months after the El Nio. He explained that the large-scale death of corals was due to the sea surface temperature increasing to a level that corals cannot tolerate.
The NARA officer observed that the coral reefs along the Western and Southern coasts were badly affected last year, while the East coast did not suffer that much because of the wind pattern and atmospheric conditions.
When we went last week, we discovered that the reef has not recovered and most of the damaged corals have now become rubble. With the wave action and current, they roll over the living corals and bury them. The bleached corals have not got time to recover because of this movement of coral rubble, he explained.
He pointed out that in the case of 1998, the reef structure was largely intact because it was the first large-scale bleaching event. This helped new coral larvae to settle. When it happened this time, the reef structure was weak. Now it has turned to rubble, he added.
Ocean Resources Conservation Association (ORCA) Marine Research Team Leader Prasanna Weerakkody speaking to the Daily News said the Bar Reef had a chance of recovering in post-1998 due to minimum human impact in the area during the time of war.
Certain sections of the Bar Reef recovered almost perfectly and gained about 90 percent live coral cover within a decade from 1998-2009. However, now there is a lot more human impact on it such as fishing pressure, dynamiting and use of laila and surukku nets, ornamental fish collection, tourism and pollution. We do not know the future of the reef. For proper recovery, we need to restrict human impact. The coral reef is going to have a very difficult period recovering and it is not going to recover if we add our own pressure over it, he said.
He observed there is a heavy growth of algae on the reef now.
The Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary declared in 1992 is the largest marine protected area in Sri Lanka. It stretches parallel to the coast from the northern end of the Kalpitiya Peninsula, to the islands which separate Portugal Bay from the Gulf of Mannar. The reserve covers about 306 square kilometres.

Leicester continue revival under Shakespeare
LONDON , Saturday - Leicester City continued their revival under new manager Craig Shakespeare as a 3-2 win at West Ham United on Saturday gave the English champions their first away league win of the season.
Shakespeare's fourth successive victory in all competitions since he took over from Italian Claudio Ranieri last month left Leicester in 14th position on 30 points from 28 games, six above the relegation zone.
The visitors produced a superb first half as early goals by Riyad Mahrez and centre back Robert Huth gave them a 2-0 lead and Jamie Vardy made it 3-1 after Manuel Lanzini had pulled one back with a brilliant free kick.
The Foxes were on the back foot after Andrew Ayew headed in West Ham's second and goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel producing two stunning saves to deny Andy Carroll while Ayew blasted over the bar with the goal at his mercy.

Lesser known, better value
An evergreen tree with glossy bright leaves, lavulu, is an attractive asset to the garden with its fruit turning a bright yellowish color after ripening. It is valued as an ornamental tree with great medicinal value. It is a fine garden companion to have. Garden Talk speaks to Director Institute of Indigenous Medicine, Swarna Hapuarachchi on the Lavulu fruit that is grown for food, medicine and aesthetic value.
It is a very delicious sweet fruit. After ripening it takes a bright yellowish orange color. The interior pulp also is yellowish orange. At the beginning before ripening, the fruit is greenish. It has a high carotene content and has a strong smell. Like, Durian some people like the smell and some people don't. After ripening it is very soft and puffy and we can easily break it apart without using a knife, said Hapuarachchi.
Lavulu can also be made into a curry similar to dhal curry. You can even make a tempered curry as well. The Lavulu is cooked while it is the stage between un-ripened (immature) and ripened (maturity). After it softens it is very difficult to cook. After it takes on a yellow color, it becomes very soft.
When you prepare the curry the fruit should be hard and after cooking it becomes soft. Before ripening you cannot eat, because it is hard. After it ripens and softens it can be eaten as a fruit. When immature it has high latex making it difficult to eat. The bark and when plucking the immature fruit, we can find it has high white gummy latex which is why it is so hard to eat un-ripened fruit. And when it is cooked, it loses its sweetness, stated Hapuarachchi.
Varieties
Lavulu tree is middle sized. In Sri Lanka it can be grown everywhere. There is no definite zone. It is grown in the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia and Cuba. There are so many varieties - nearly 60 varieties, the sizes vary.
However this is an under-utilized crop, because it is not available. Not many people know about it. It can be found in villages. Throughout the year it can be grown anywhere in Sri Lanka. Usually it is available, preferably in the wet and intermediate zones, added Hapuarachchi.
It is good for the younger children since it has high carotene content. It has high nutritional value, and has a high calorie content. Lavulu also has a very high energy value and rich with Vitamin C. It has high Carbohydrate content. It has proteins as well.
It can be used as a jam or jelly, as well as a milkshake. When it is ripened it can be blended with milk and other ingredients and made into a milkshake. It is extremely tasty with natural vitamins. A number of processed food items, such as dessert (ice cream), marmalade and pancakes can be made. Lavulu also can be used to make sandwiches as the ripened fruit can be used as a paste. It has a very nice color with the layers. It can be used with chicken or fish sandwiches.
We can make the dried fruit into a powder. It can be used as a nutritional powder. We cannot preserve the Lavulu fruit as it is not long lasting. The ripened mature fruit cannot be kept for long. If we can dry it and powder it, we can use it. It can then be used with the milk or in pudding mixes. Fruits can be processed into pickles, explained Hapuarachchi.
Medicinal value
As a medicinal plant it has immense value addressing a variety of medical problems.
In Mexico the bark of the Lavulu tree is used to make decoction. It is used for fevers. In Cuba it is used for skin diseases. The seed is used as a remedy for ulcers. But still in Sri Lanka we are not using this for medicinal purposes. We are only using this as a fruit and curry, but this is not practised widely. If trees are available in our home garden then we can do it. The problem is that it is not popular. In Cuba a decoction prepared from the bark of lavalu is used to cure skin eruptions. The paste of seeds is applied for ulcers, pointed out Hapuarachchi.
Flowering under tropical climate extends from January to June, though some trees flower throughout the year. The fruits generally mature from September to February. Some trees produce more or less continuously throughout the year.

The Living Authors with the Most Film Adaptations
It seems as though every other day theres an announcement of a new forthcoming film adaptation of a beloved (or just new) novelafter all, where else would great films come from Its a huge deal to have your novel adapted for the big screen, but some authors probably dont even notice it anymore. There are plenty of writers whose works have been made into many, many filmsWilliam Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Arthur Conan Doyle being the high rollers that immediately spring to mind. But with contemporaryread, livingauthors, the field is a little slimmer. So I wonderedwhich living authors have had the most films adapted from their work (so far) I wondered, I searched, and then I made this infographic.
Some notes on methodology: first of all, this information doesnt exist in any organized place (until now), so I had to search film adaptations author by author. If Ive missed someone, this is why. In fact, Im sure Ive missed someone, but all research has to stop somewhere. Next, I wasnt picky about source material: movies adapted from novels, short stories, and novellas all count, though original screenplays written by novelists do not. I didnt count sequels of films not themselves based on an original workso The Mangler counts, but not The Mangler 2 or The Mangler Reborn. (Im also not counting anthology films in which not all of the segments are adaptations, though this is only an issue for Stephen King, who doesnt need any more of a lead.) On the other hand, single works that have been adapted twice (or split into two films) do get counted twice. Heres a big one: Ive only counted films that were theatrically releasedso no made-for-TV movies. This changes the data a lotfor instance, Danielle Steel has more than 20 TV movie adaptations to her name (and only one theatrical release, in Australia)but I think this way is more faithful to what we mean when we talk about film adaptations.
You had to clear five actual films to get on my list, which is a pretty high bar. Anne Rice doesnt cut it. James Patterson doesnt either. Ive counted films slated as 2017 releases where appropriate, but nothing only announced or in production, because the movie business is unreliable and projects crash and burn all the time. Finally, for my sanity, Ive only counted films based on books written in English.

The London Stock Exchange Group hosted a Womens Day forum titled We Can Do IT for ICT students at the Moratuwa, Kelaniya universities, the Asia-Pacific Institute of Information Technology (APIIT), and the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) with a focus on empowerment.
The panel, comprising senior employees of London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) and MillenniumIT, included Head of HR for LSEG Sri Lanka Bani Chandrasena, Project Director Vidumini Ranasinghe, Software Engineer Dinu Kumarasiri, Senior Business Consultant Amani Gunawardhene and Head of Pre-Sales Sabiha Nanji. The moderator was Associate Business Consultant Erangi De Costa.
The panellists shared their personal experiences including details of their chosen career paths and their views on career advancements and maintaining a work-life balance. They also spoke of the challenges faced working in a historically male dominated industry, before discussing the enormous scope within the local and global ICT arena for women today.
The panel discussion was intended to create awareness of prospective recruitment opportunities and employment opportunities within the IT industry, and to address the misconceptions women have about working in this field.
The panellists discussed topics such as managing a work-life balance, the various subjects and courses that are best suitable for the various job descriptions, and the emotional intelligence and multitasking abilities that women possess to tackle work-related tasks that are considered value-additions to organisations.
LSEG advocates womens rights, equality and empowerment through access to various options including day care facilities, flexible hours, buddy-systems and role models to help and nurture its female employees. Women, like their male counterparts, are encouraged to work on the same projects and programmes and are treated as equals.
Held for the third consecutive year, this forum has helped many students fulfil their dreams and overcome their uncertainties of working in this industry.
This programme complements the various other initiatives by the Group held throughout the year which aim to empower and groom students to step into a professional career in the Technology industry.

Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.61% W-o-W (or LKR 16.25Bn) to LKR 2,655.87Bn cf. LKR 2,672.12Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 55.46% (or LKR 1.53Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Hemas Holdings, Melstacorp and Expolanka which accounted for 94.68% of the sectors total turnover. The Manufacturing Sector meanwhile accounted for 11.10% (or LKR 0.31Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by Teejay Lanka & Tokyo Cement which accounted for 71.06% sector turnover.
The Banks, Finance and Insurance Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 8.86% (or LKR 0.24Bn) to the market. The sector turnover was driven by Seylan Bank (NV) and Commercial Bank which accounted for 46.45% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume too, accounting for 49.14% (or 68.37Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.53Bn.

In terms of volume, Expolanka Holdings and SMB Leasing (X) led foreign purchases while Teejay Lanka and Softlogic Life led foreign sales. In terms of value, Hemas Holdings & Melstacorp led foreign purchases while Teejay Lanka and Aitken Spence foreign sales.
Point of view
Equity markets fell to a one-year low of 6028 points this week before recovering ~19 points to close marginally stronger at 6047.8 points.
The benchmark ASPI made consecutive losses between Monday and Thursday, losing ~56 points amid weak sentiment and rate concerns to hit a low of 6028 points on Thursday.
Strong institutional and HNI interest on Friday however, helped the Index pare down some of its early losses. Fridays crossings in Blue-Chips and mid-caps accounted for ~62% of the weeks total crossings of LKR 1.2Bn; Crossings for the week however, were notably lower than that of the last two week (44% of total market turnover cf. 52% last week and 72% the week prior) helping push the average daily turnover on the bourse ~29.4% lower to LKR 0.55Bn (cf. LKR 0.78Bn last week).
Net foreign flows to equities meanwhile continued for the 7th consecutive week, although 67% lower than last week. The net inflows were despite the US Feds widely anticipated decision to raise interest rates by 25 Bps (to 0.75%-1%) for the 3rd time in a decade.
Emerging market stocks reacted positively to the expected rate hike and the US Feds dovish outlook for the future path of US rates rising to 20-month highs1. Although average risk premiums on EM sovereign debt also tightened as markets perceived the Feds decision and tone positively, the normalization of US Fed rates prompted several EM central banks (China, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait & Bahrain) to also increase rates.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look to look for cue from the CBSLs upcoming policy rate decision next week.
Q416 GDP rebounds but full year growth
GDP growth in Q416 rebounded to 5.3% Y-o-Y, up from the 2.8% Y-o-Y growth recorded in Q415 and 4.6% Y-o-Y recorded in the 3rd quarter of 2016. Growth over the quarter was driven by the Industry sector which grew 9.2% Y-o-Y over the quarter relative to 1.1% Y-o-Y recorded in Q415 with Construction sector activity continuing its recovery (15.5% Y-o-Y cf. -0.9% Y-o-Y in Q415) over the period.
The Services sector too grew 4.6% Y-o-Y over Q416 in line with performance in Q316 but higher than the 3.2% Y-o-Y growth recorded in the comparable period a year ago.
However, the continued impact of the drought in Q416 had an adverse impact on the countrys rice, vegetables and cereal production, pushing growth from the Agricultural sector sharply lower over the quarter (-8.4% Y-o-Y vs. +0.5% Y-o-Y in Q415).
Sri Lankas full year 2016 GDP growth meanwhile, fell to 4.4% Y-o-Y (cf. 4.8% Y-o-Y in 2015) in line with the CBSL, IMF and World Bank estimates of 4.5-5.0% Y-o-Y. Growth over 2016 was the countrys weakest performance since 2013 (3.4% Y-o-Y) and is primarily attributable to the impact from the combination of floods in Q216 and drought in the remaining quarters.
The Agricultural sector consequently recorded a slowdown of -4.2% Y-o-Y (cf. +4.8% Y-o-Y in Q415).
Although slower than in 2015 ((+4.2% Y-o-Y cf. +5.7% Y-o-Y in 2015), growth in Services activities remained buoyant, supported by improvements in financial services, and wholesale and retail trade activities.
Industry sector growth meanwhile, grew strongly in 2016 (+6.7% Y-o-Y cf. 2.1% Y-o-Y) with considerable contribution from the construction sector rebound and notable growth in manufacturing, and mining and quarrying activities.

NARA refutes fishing community allegations
A scientific research carried out by NARA into allegations levelled by the fishing community that there is a natural rock reef in the deep sea, from where sand is taken for the earth filling of the Colombo International Financial City, has revealed that there was no such rock reef.
The sea sand is acquired for the Colombo International Financial City project from a deep sea area nearly 10 kilometres off the Negombo coastal area.
The fishing community of the Negombo area, had been claiming that the natural rock reef at the place where sand was taken, could be damaged when sucking in sea sand.
The Western Province and Mega Polis Development Ministry sought the assistance of NARA to launch a scientific research into the issue and ascertain whether there was a natural rock reef in the said sea area.
The scientific research report in this regard was issued by NARA two weeks ago and the report has clearly mentioned that there was no rock reef in that particular sea area.

Never go blind
Glaucoma is an eye disease affecting the optic nerve which is usually associated with increased eye pressure and progressive visual field defects.
It is the second commonest cause of blindness in the world being second only to cataract. Currently about 60 million people suffer from this disease. It is a progressive disease and if not treated properly it can lead to blindness.
Symptoms
With the most common type of glaucoma, the open angle glaucoma, no symptoms occur usually. With the progression of the disease, visual field defects start in the peripheral field. However this may not be noticed by the patient as the central vision will remain good. Few patients may also experience slight headache, tearing or difficulty in looking at light.
With the other type of glaucoma, the angle closure glaucoma the presentation is dramatic. Sudden onset redness and severe pain in the eye with headache and vomiting could occur. Visual blurring may also occur with extreme difficulty in looking at light. This is an ophthalmological emergency where the eye will become blind permanently in a short time if not treated.
Who can get glaucoma
Anybody can get glaucoma. Anybody from a newborn to a senior citizen can get glaucoma. Babies can be born with glaucoma but the risk increases with old age. People with refractive errors (who need glasses to correct vision) and those with a family history (relations with glaucoma) are more at risk.
Angle closure type occurs more in elderly females and usually the sudden onset attacks occur during evenings.
Treatment
As there is no cure for glaucoma early detection and treatment is the only way out to avoid blindness from glaucoma.
After diagnosing the condition glaucoma can be treated with the objective of minimizing further damage. With the advancement of medicine and medical technology the recent advances in treatment has shown promising results in treatment and monitoring of glaucoma.
With a mere drop of medication in to the eye once a day, the eye pressure is controlled in many patients. Reducing the production of fluid inside the eye, increasing the drainage of the fluid in the eye and protecting the nerve from pressure damage are some mechanisms of actions of the medicines used. However the patient may not feel any change to know whether the drug is working. Therefore this needs to be checked periodically with checking of eye pressure, monitoring of visual fields and optic nerve imaging.
If the progression of damage is continuing, the option of surgical intervention to create an additional pathway to drain the fluid in the eye may be considered. Another option is laser treatment to the eye.
World Glaucoma week -March 12- 18
* Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease affecting the optic nerve usually associated with increased pressure in the eye and deterioration of visual fields.
* As there are no definite symptoms checking the eyes, is the only way to detect glaucoma.
* Proper treatment and monitoring can control the disease to prevent the occurrence of blindness due to glaucoma.

Never say cheese always!
Eating too much cheese may raise your risk of getting breast cancer by more than 50 per cent. Cheddar and cream cheese in particular could increase the danger, a study of women's diets found.
Dairy, with the exception of yoghurt, has been linked to the disease because it contains a growth hormone called IGF-1, thought to turn good cells into malignant ones and encourage breast cancer growth.
It has also been linked to obesity, which raises the risk of 13 types of cancer.
Eating too much cheddar or cream cheese could raise the risk of breast cancer by more than 50 per cent. Dairy, apart from yoghurt, contains the growth hormone IGF-1, which encourages malignant cells (file photo)
Researchers at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in New York looked at more than 3,000 women - of whom 1,941 had breast cancer - over 11 years, measuring dairy intake.
They found cheese raised the risk of breast cancer by 53 per cent, particularly a high intake of cheddar and cream cheeses, while eating yoghurt appeared to cut the danger by 30 per cent.
Lead author and professor of oncology Dr Susan McCann said: 'Dairy foods are complex mixtures of nutrients and non- nutrient substances that could be negatively as well as positively associated with breast cancer risk.'
Charity Breast Cancer Now said the cancer link was still not proven but people should eat a balanced and varied diet.
However, dairy products have also been linked with obesity, which raises the risk of getting 13 types of cancer.
The US scientists looked at more than 3,000 women over 11 years, measuring dairy intake using a food questionnaire.
They found cheese raised the risk of breast cancer by 53 per cent, particularly a high intake of cheddar and cream cheeses, plus American varieties.
However eating yoghurt appeared to cut the risk by 30 per cent for the women studied, 1,941 of whom had breast cancer.
Lead author and professor of oncology Dr Susan McCann said: 'Dairy foods are complex mixtures of nutrients and non-nutrient substances that could be negatively as well as positively associated with breast cancer risk.
'Future studies are needed to confirm the protective potential of yogurt in this type of cancer.'
Manveet Basra, senior public health officer at Breast Cancer Now, said: 'Despite this, and many other studies looking at whether or not there is a link between diet or specific foods and breast cancer, this link is still not clear.
'We do know that eating a balanced and varied diet can help to maintain a healthy weight, which in turn can lower an individual's risk of developing breast cancer.
'However, it is difficult to separate out the real impact of specific foods from other lifestyle factors.' -Dailymail

Newcastle stutter again
LONDON, Saturday -Newcastle United's stuttering progress towards promotion back to the Premier League continued as they were held 0-0 by Birmingham City on Saturday, although they remain in pole position.
Rafa Benitez's side's third Championship match without a win could have proved more damaging but second-placed Brighton & Hove Albion went down 2-0 at playoff-chasing Leeds United.
Third-placed Huddersfield Town were thrashed 4-0 at lowly Bristol City on Friday.
Leaders Newcastle have 78 points, a point ahead of Brighton and seven in front of Huddersfield, who have a game in hand on their promotion rivals. Leeds are fourth with 69 points.
Fulham missed the chance to move into the playoff places when they were beaten 3-1 at home by Wolverhampton Wanderers.
People may expect us to win every away game but this was a valuable away point, Benitez said.
There are still eight matches to be played and as Huddersfield lost we are now in a better position than we were before the game.
The point leaves Gianfranco Zola's struggling Birmingham side five points above the drop zone.
Nottingham Forest grabbed a stoppage time equaliser against Derby County as the East Midlands derby ended 2-2 at the City Ground in Mark Warburton's first match in charge, with visiting manager Gary Rowett also making his debut in the dug out.
Derby led 2-1 with goals from Matej Vydra and David Nugent after falling behind, but Forest's Daniel Pinillos struck in the 94th minute to earn a point that keeps the former English and European champions just above the relegation zone.
It would have been very upsetting not to take something from the game, former Rangers boss Warburton said.
After a really pleasing first half, it was frustrating to find yourself 2-1 down. But they showed great character and that got the late reward. We deserved the point.
Forest are a point above the drop zone where Blackburn Rovers, another club to have won the English title, have 40 after being denied a victory at home to Preston North End when the visitors scored in stoppage time for a 2-2 draw.

Over 200 new entrepreneurs being created at only Rs 32 mn- Rishad
Sri Lankas apex entrepreneurship developer operated by the state, the National Enterprise Development Agency (NEDA), is now on a major youth entrepreneur drive-and the latest node in Sri Lankas grassroots market linkage network to start operations will be serving the small time young farmers and fisher-folk in Northern Provinces Mannar District.
We encourage our youth to be not a burden on the public resources said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the inauguration of the Vidatha Resource Centre in Museli, Mannar on March 16.
He was joined by State Minister of Technology & Research Lakshman Seneviratne.
The National Enterprise Development Agency (NEDA) under my Ministry already works with Vidatha. There are many informal partnerships between Vidatha offices and our NEDA field network. The Ministry is working on serving this aim and its graduate entrepreneurship project the Upadidharee Vyavasayaka Udaanaya is a major project.
In this project 215 graduates have been introduced to technology based new SME start-ups at a cost of more than Rs 32 million. 13 graduates from the total 215 are selected from North. The importance in this project is that proposals submitted by youth are evaluated on models of viability and financing potentials.
More importantly, the businesses encouraged are new technology based. I encourage graduates of Mannar and Museli area too to join this program. The Vidatha centre launched today can help Mannar and Museli youth in farming and fishery sectors to link to main markets using latest technologies.

Public-private stakeholders  identify 15 tourism priorities
After full day workshop at Temple Trees
Key public and private sector tourism stakeholders have identified 15 priority projects to boost and sustain tourism growth over the next three years.
A full day workshop to identify these priorities was held at Temple Trees recently . It was organised by the Ministry of Policy Development and Economic Affairs.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Tourism Development Minister, John Amaratunga, and Deputy Tourism Minister, Arundika Fernando participated in the workshop which was conducted under the auspices of the Governments Economic Delivery Programme, which aims to accelerate the delivery of Sri Lankas most important economic outcomes over the next 3 years.
These outcomes are: an increase in median income, private sector job creation, foreign and domestic investment, exports and government revenue.Under this programme, tourism has been selected as one of six areas for acceleration. The other areas are: agriculture, manufacturing, investment acceleration, digital economy and government revenue. The government has also set up a Delivery Unit, called the Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU), to support the implementation of the Economic Delivery Programme.
More than 150 tourism industry representatives engaged in brain storming sessions to kick start implementation of the governments Tourism Vision 2025 and Tourism Strategic Plan 2017-2020. The audience spanned a diverse group of sub-sectors within the travel and tourism industry, with both large and boutique, Sri Lankan and international players represented.
Similarly, the public sector was represented not only by the Ministry of Tourism and its agencies, but also other government agencies that have an impact on the sector such as the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, Ministry of Western Megapolis Development, Central Cultural Fund, Department of Wildlife Conservation, Police etc.
The participants worked through the day in joint public-private teams to identify potential solutions for addressing the main challenges faced by the industry and developed a preliminary list of 15 prioritised projects to implement within the next 1 to 3 years. The main goal is to ensure Sri Lanka doubles its tourism sector earnings from the present $3.5bn in 2016 to $7 bn by 2020.
At the conclusion of the workshop a selection of the most impactful projects were presented to the Prime Minister and Minister of Tourism who will regularly review progress to ensure rapid and effective implementation.
Some of the top projects were:
Improve international air connectivity to priority markets (from 80 to 130 flights per day) through more direct flights, open skies policy, competitive landing and parking fees, incentivising low-cost airlines and smoother immigration and check-in procedures. Work with public and private stakeholders to create a Colombo Calendar of events which tourists can access across multiple channels (e.g., pick up from hotels or in the airports, access online, get notifications over social media).
Fast-track tailored destination marketing campaigns in the key source markets; initiate a digital marketing campaign in next 1-2 months, as a precursor to the upcoming global campaign.
Meanwhile a Tourism Delivery Lab is to be set up as a follow up to the workshop. This lab will engage in short-burst, intensive implementation plan development sessions that aim to translate the identified project ideas into implementable plans.

Pujara, Saha put India on top in 3rd Test
Ranchi: Cheteshwar Pujara said Sunday the spinners should win the third Test for India after his double century and a marathon partnership with centurion Wriddhiman Saha put the hosts on top against Australia.
After declaring their first innings on 603 for nine late in the final session on day four in Ranchi, the hosts rattled Australia with two strikes including the key scalp of David Warner (14).
Ravindra Jadeja disposed of both Warner and nightwatchman Nathan Lyon (2) in an absorbing final session of play.
The tourists, 152 behind on the first innings, ended the day on 23-2.
Before bamboozling the Australian batsmen with his left-arm spin, Jadeja also scored an unbeaten 54.
I am very confident our spinners (Ravichandran Ashwin and Jadeja) will bowl really well. There is rough, there are cracks (on the pitch), said Pujara.
The day belonged to Pujara (202) and Saha (117), who put on 199 for the seventh wicket to frustrate an Australian bowling attack that failed to take a wicket in the first two sessions.
Pujara recorded his third Test double-century in his 47th match and Saha posted a career-best Test knock to take India way past Australias first innings score of 451.
Pujara, who resumed the day on 130, hit 21 boundaries in an otherwise sedate innings which lasted for 525 balls -- the longest innings by an Indian Test player in terms of balls faced.
I have the experience of scoring big runs in domestic cricket, said Pujara, who recently scored a century during a 300-plus stand with Saha in the final of a domestic competition.
Experience matters a lot. When I was batting, I thought we just wanted to get close to their total... I could have played more shots but I had to control myself.
The 29-year-old -- whose top Test score is 206 not out against England in 2012 -- got to his double century with a flick to square leg off Nathan Lyon. He pumped his fist in a rare show of emotion as his teammates cheered from the balcony.
But he was out in Lyons next over, lobbing a catch to midwicket. He walked back to the pavilion to a standing ovation and a few handshakes from the opposition players.
Saha, who hit seven fours and a six, soon followed his overnight partner after falling to left-arm spinner Steve OKeefe.
This is the best among the three (Test hundreds) I have, Saha told reporters. We badly needed a partnership. Pujara has so much patience... he is always at the top of his game, said Saha, adding that every Indian bowler would be effective come day five.
Plan to combat Jadeja
Jadeja came in at number nine and played a useful cameo, putting on 54 for the ninth wicket with Umesh Yadav (16).
Pat Cummins claimed four wickets while left-arm spinner OKeefe took three.
Australias coach Darren Lehmann said Steven Smiths side has the mettle to last three sessions against the Indian spinners.
Going to have to come up with a plan to combat Jadeja, but weve worked on that and youll probably see it tomorrow, I would think, said Lehmann.
Once the ball gets a little bit softer it plays pretty well so theres no real demons in the track.
Its a case of obviously applying ourselves, much like Pujara and Saha did today. Weve done a lot of practice in those conditions so Im really confident they can do the job, he added.
The four-match series for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy is tied 1-1. AFP

Issues on arbitration
Q: I am a law student following a Diploma in Arbitration. Canarbitration take place out of Colombo What is the difference between ad-hoc and institutional arbitration
A: Under Arbitration Act No. 11 of 1995, arbitration of a dispute can take place in any part of the country.
However, under the Arbitration Act enforcement, applications under Section 31 (1) has to be made to the High Court and challenges to Arbitration awards under Section 32 should also be made to the High Court. Incidental applications should also be made to the High Court.
The High Court referred to in the Act has been defined under Section 50. "High Court" means the High Court of Sri Lanka situated in the judicial zone of Colombo or situated in such other zone, as may be, designated by the Minister with the concurrence of the Chief Justice by Order published in the Gazette.
In the circumstances, until such time, the Provincial High Courts are designated by the Minister with the concurrence of the Chief Justice even if arbitration takes place in a place other than Colombo. The relevant High Court before an application for enforcement should be made is the Colombo High Court.
Arbitration when administered by an institution according to the rules of the institution accepted by parties to the arbitration is designated as institutional arbitration.
When no specified institutional rules are referred to in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitration that takes place proceed on an ad-hoc basis on rules agreed by the arbitrators at the time of arbitration.
In many circumstances of ad-hoc arbitration, parties and arbitrators informally follow accepted model arbitration rules such as those of the UNCTAD. The advantage of institutional arbitration is that the responsibility for organizing the arbitration is entrusted to arbitration institutionally.

Real-life couple who inspired Beauty and the Beast
As he waited at the altar for his beautiful bride, Petrus Gonsalvus was trembling with nerves. Like many 16th century grooms, he had never seen the woman he was about to wed and this sensitive French courtier had more reason than most to worry.
So when the chapel door creaked open, Petrus turned around to lock eyes with wife-to-be Catherine. What he saw in them must have broken his heart... a look of horror, panic and sheer revulsion.
Because she found herself staring into the face of what she viewed as a beast  a monster, a freak of nature, the mythical Wildman said to eat babies alive.
Catherine managed to control her terror and married this ugly creature, covered from head to toe in wolf-like hair. But even more remarkably, she saw past the exterior and fell in love with the brave man blighted by a cruel and misunderstood illness. They had seven children and lived happily ever after for 45 years.
Sound familiar Thats because Petrus and Catherine inspired one of the most famous fairy tales, Beauty and the Beast.
French author Gabrielle-Suzanne de Villeneuve wrote La Belle et la Bte in 1740 and millions of youngsters will now watch Emma Watson and Dan Stevens breathe new life into the fable as the latest Disney adaptation hits cinemas.
But the real-life tale truly proves the storys moral  beauty is only skin deep.
Hypertrichosis
Petrus was born Pedro Gonzalez in Tenerife in 1537, his face and body covered in thick hair that gave him the look of a mythical werewolf. We now know he had inherited condition hypertrichosis, or Ambras syndrome, which sparks thick hair growth all over the body.
The rare genetic mutation is also called werewolf syndrome and just 50 cases have been recorded since the Middle Ages  Petrus being the first.
Little is known of his family but his appearance sparked fear, fascination and superstitious theories in equal measure. He was seen as a monster an unholy hermit of evil  one of the Wildmen of the Woods, who stalked babies in the dead of night and ate them alive.
But freaks of nature were also seen as status symbols by royals and noblemen. So when Pedro was 10, he was captured and taken to France as a coronation gift for Henry II and his queen Catherine de Medici.
On his arrival, the kings physicians and scholars poked and prodded him to see if he would roar. Instead, he stunned them by whispering his name. He was held in the dungeon for further tests.
The scholars reported the wildman was still a child and he showed no sign of aggression or magical powers. So Henry decided to conduct an experiment.
Pedro was allowed to keep his name but in Latin  Petrus Gonsalvus. He got fine clothes and an education fit for a noblemans son. Henry wanted to see if he could make a gentleman of the savage.
And after proving a quick learner by mastering three languages, he remained under the kings protection, shown off to visitors and foreign nobles. Artists flocked from far and wide to paint him.
Marriage
Italian historian Roberto Zapperi, who has written a book on Petrus, says: He was a nobleman. He dressed like one and held a position at court.
Someone who lived by these rules had to marry. The challenge was finding a woman prepared to marry a man who looked like an animal.
In 1559, the king was killed in a jousting match.
He was succeeded by widow Catherine, who in 1573 decided to continue with his experiment by marrying off Petrus and breeding little wildmen.
She began hunting for a bride and wanted a woman strong enough to survive the shock of seeing Petrus at the altar but pretty enough to arouse the beast within the Beast. The Catherine she picked was the daughter of a court servant, whose surname remains unknown.
What happened on their wedding day is not known either and they probably spent the wedding night being spied on by the Queens doctors, keen to observe the Beasts mating ritual and see if the Beauty survived it. But, to the amazement of the court, Catherine and Petrus settled into a happy married life.
Catherine then had two sons, Paolo and Ercole, who did not inherit their fathers condition.
International sensation
But the next two, Enrico and Orazio, did  and the Queen was delighted. The couple also had three girls  Maddalena, Francesca and Antoinetta  all of whom had hypertrichosis.
The family became an international sensation and was allowed to travel Europe to stay with other nobles. They settled in Spain under the patronage of the Duke of Parma.
Zapperi explains: The situation was strange, they were neither captured nor free and got paid very well. The Duke let Petrus run an estate near Parma  but then sent his hairy children away as gifts to fellow dukes. Antoinetta became a plaything for the Dukes own mistress.
It was another cruel blow for gentle-hearted Petrus and his loyal wife. In their final lives, the couple finally found peace at Lake Bolsena in Capodimonte, Italy, on one of the Dukes estates. They were treated as ordinary, respected citizens and it is known Petrus attended the christening of his grandson in 1617.
It is believed he died the following year, aged 81. Catherines death was recorded in 1623. But it seems the real-life fairy tale may not have had such a happy ending as the fictional Beauty and the Beast.
Petrus had proved a caring man, a loving husband and devoted father. But on his deathbed, he was denied the holy oil that anoints the forehead in the last rites.
It meant he could not be buried in sacred ground. Even at the end, Petrus was seen as an animal. Mirror

Resurgent Ireland deny England rugby grand slam
DUBLIN, Saturday - Ireland stunned England 13-9 in the Six Nations on Saturday to deny their old rivals a second successive grand slam and end their hopes of a world record 19th victory in a row.
Joe Schmidt's Irish team secured a top seeding for the 2019 World Cup draw as a try by lock Iain Henderson after 23 minutes proved the difference between the sides.
While England improved after being completely dominated in the first half, they failed to make a serious dent in the Irish defence.
England won the tournament last week with a 61-21 thrashing of Scotland, but they collected the Six Nations trophy in a downbeat mood as the third English side in 16 years to be denied a grand slam in Dublin on the final day of the tournament.
We didn't slam it but, hey-ho, we're still the champions, said England captain Dylan Hartley. Full credit to Ireland.
They put us under unbelievable pressure.
England lost in 2001 and 2011 but hammered Ireland in a grand slam decider in the old Lansdowne Road in 2003, months before they won the World Cup.
The win also denied England a tier-one record of 19 consecutive wins just four months after Ireland prevented world champions New Zealand from reaching the same milestone with a 40-29 win in November.
England, who matched the All Blacks 18-match run with their victory over Scotland last week, have now lost seven times in their last 10 visits to Dublin. Victory rescued a poor Six Nations championship for Ireland, who lost to Scotland and Wales after beating three southern hemisphere teams last year. Ireland ended the tournament in second place and are guaranteed to be one of the top four seeds in the draw for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which will see them avoid heavyweights New Zealand, Australia and England in the group stage.
It wasnt about us stopping England. It was about us producing a performance. This is a really big lift for us, Ireland captain Rory Best said.
England are a fantastic team, they deserve the Championship.

ROCK N ROLL LEGEND CHUCK BERRY DEAD
US: Chuck Berry, one of the creators of rock 'n' roll whose dance-ready rhythms and energetic stage performances helped define modern youth culture, died Saturday. He was 90.
Police in the St. Louis area, where Berry was born and lived most of his life, said that first responders found the guitar legend unresponsive when they responded to an emergency call at his home.
The St. Charles County Police Department sadly confirms the death of Charles Edward Anderson Berry Sr., better known as legendary musician Chuck Berry, the department said on Facebook.
Berry became a sensation in the years after World War II as he brought together rhythm and blues, country guitar and a consummate stage showmanship.
His 1958 hit Johnny B. Goode was so influential and recognizable that the US space program chose it to represent rock music for potential extraterrestrial listeners on the Voyager spacecraft.
Roll Over Beethoven from 1956 was almost a manifesto of rock 'n' roll as the charismatic Berry urged the DJ to switch off the classical records and turn to the new genre of the youth.
Other hits included Maybellene, one of the pioneering rock songs that gave a guitar edge to a popular fiddle tune, and Sweet Little Sixteen, in which Berry hailed rock 'n' roll's sweep across the United States.
But Berry, one of the first African Americans to find a widespread white audience, saw his career crumble in 1959 when he was arrested for taking a 14-year-old girl across state lines for immoral purposes under an obscure 1910 law.
Berry defended himself against the allegations he slept with the young waitress. But he was convicted by an all-white jury and served a year and a half in prison.
Associates would later describe the laid-back and fun-loving Berry as a changed man, and the conviction has long been viewed in the African American community as a warning sign for artists on the rise.
Berry mostly avoided the media limelight as he resurrected his career. In a rare 1987 interview with NBC television, Berry declined to describe himself as the father of rock 'n' roll, listing others including his contemporary Elvis Presley as well as Fats Domino and Little Richard. We're all I think just a cog in the wheel. We all got the ball rolling, he said.
Berry late in his life stayed low-profile in St. Louis where he played two decades worth of shows at the Blueberry Club, with his son Charles Berry Jr. in his backup band.
In a surprise, Berry last year celebrated his 90th birthday by announcing that he had recorded his first album in 38 years.
Entitled simply Chuck, the album is slated to be released sometime this year.
In a statement as he announced the album, Berry dedicated it to his wife of 68 years, Themetta Berry.
Meanwhile,Chuck Berry's death drew emotional tributes from fellow musicians and other celebrities who praised him as a rock 'n' roll trailblazer.
Here are some reactions from Twitter: - Bruce Springsteen: Chuck Berry was rock's greatest practitioner, guitarist, and the greatest pure rock 'n' roll writer who ever lived.
This is a tremendous loss of a giant for the ages. - Brian Wilson: I am so sad to hear about Chuck Berry passing -- a big inspiration! He will be missed by everyone who loves Rock 'n' Roll. Love & Mercy. - Ringo Starr: R I P. And peace and love Chuck Berry Mr. rock 'n' roll music. - Lenny Kravitz: Hail Hail Chuck Berry!!! None of us would have been here without you. Rock on brother! - Rod Stewart: It started with Chuck Berry. He inspired us all.
The 1st album I bought was Chuck's 'Live at the Tivoli' and I was never the same. - The Rolling Stones: The Rolling Stones are deeply saddened to hear of the passing of Chuck Berry. He was a true pioneer of rock 'n' roll & a massive influence.
Chuck Berry was not only a brilliant guitarist, singer and performer, but most importantly, he was a master craftsman as a songwriter.
Chuck Berry's songs will live forever. - Mick Jagger: I am so sad to hear of Chuck Berry's passing. I want to thank him for all the inspirational music he gave to us.
He lit up our teenage years, and blew life into our dreams of being musicians and performers.
His lyrics shone above others & threw a strange light on the American dream. Chuck you were amazing & your music is engraved inside us forever. - Ronnie Wood: So sad -- with the passing of Chuck Berry comes the end of an era. He was one of the best and my inspiration, a true character indeed. - Keith Richards: One of my big lights has gone out. - Arnold Schwarzenegger:
When I was 10 years old and I dreamed every night of moving to America, Chuck Berry played the soundtrack. He rocked the world. RIP. - Stephen King: Chuck Berry died. This breaks my heart, but 90 years old ain't bad for rock and roll. Johnny B. Goode forever.  - AFP

Ruling the ramp
The modeling industry is normally ruled by the ladies. However Daniel Rene de Zilva Wijewardena ruled the ramp when he took part in the 11th edition of the Mister International pageant 2016, which was held in Thailand last month. He was placed in the top 16 at the event. The 23 year old also won the Mr Teleginic mini title which would boost his opportunities in entering the acting and commercial fields.
Apart from becoming the overall winner at Mr International Sri Lanka 2016 he has also bagged the title of Mr Personality. He has appeared in several commercials and was on the catwalk for the EKKO Fashion Show and The Royal Turf Club Runway show. Daniels ambition is to become a pilot. He had done his first flight training in Canada and is continuing his studies at Kolping Kolleg in Germany and resides in Freiburg.
Q: How did you prepare ahead of the Mister International pageant
A: There are so many things that had to be prepared but I mainly went to the gym almost every day, watched my diet practiced my walk and watched the old Mister International shows.
Q: What is the best and worst moment at Mister International for you
A: I think the best thing about the pageant was meeting so many people from different parts of the world. I made a lot of friends there.
Of course the final show was also a highlight at the event. (Grinning) The worst moments were probably waking up after only three hours of sleep every day.
Q: What are your thoughts on winning the Mr Telegenic title Isnt this mini title a new addition to beauty pageants
A: Yes, it was a new addition to the pageant. I am really glad I ended up winning since acting is one of my biggest passions. We had an amazing crew to work with which made it easy for us to perform so it is not only my work that made this happen.
Q: If you could have picked another contestant to be named as the winner of the competition, who would you have picked Why
A: Its a tough question since there were so many great guys but for me personally I would have picked Mister Australia, James Carne.
He has a personality that I have never encountered before. His is a really loving and caring person but at the same time one of the craziest/funniest guys to hang out with. He would have represented Mister International very well.
Q: Is this your first ever international pageant How did you feel representing Sri Lanka at the event
A: Yes, it was my first International Pageant. It was a crazy experience from sleepless nights to people screaming to take a picture with you. I am very proud to have represented Sri Lanka at a pageant like this.
Its a great honour that has been given to me.
I would like to thank my parents, my sister Nathalie, my aunt Sriyani de Zilva and cousin Bishani Nawatathne who flew out to Thailand to support me for the event.
I am also grateful to Brian Kerkoven, National Director for Sri Lanka, Kamil Hewavitharana for all his help and guidance, my aunt Pauline de Zilva, Arvin Rasa, Lalantha Watadura and Tharushi Dabare of EKKO, Lakshman Guruge of Pettah Tailors and Hiran Wijesekara for the beautiful National costume which was greatly admired by the other contestants.
Q: What made you decide to become a model
A: It mainly happened because of one man - Brian Kerkoven. He was the one that saw my potential first and got me onto the stage and believed in me.
Without him I wouldnt have done any of this. He is an amazing person and does things for people without expecting anything from them except believing in them to give it their all.
Q: Who was your role model as a child and how did that help in you become who you are today
A: I had a lot of people that I looked up to as a child, but I never had one specific role model. For me people who believed in themselves and never gave up on pursuing and doing what they love no matter the odds, no matter what field they are in is a role model.
Q: How do you cope under the pressures of being a model
A: Actually I love the pressure of going on stage. When that adrenalin rush kicks in or you are about to do a shoot and you know now that you need to perform no matter what is a great feeling. It gives you a feeling that is unexplainable. It makes you feel alive!
Q: Five things you cant live without.
A: My family, my girlfriend, my friends, chicken and the gym. (LOL)
Q: What appeals to you about flying
A: For me flying means freedom. As a kid my biggest wish was to be able to fly. I remember dreaming about having the superpower to fly and waking up being devastated to realize that it was only just a dream. Every time I take a seat in the cockpit I know that this is the place where I should be. It is the most amazing feeling to have the ability to fly for so many reasons but the biggest one is because I love doing it.
Q: What are your guilty pleasures foodwise
A: Oooh... Chocolate, burgers and fried chicken. Yum!
Q: Who are your fashion icons
A: This might sound boring but I dont really have fashion icons.
I like people who come up with their own styles but if I had to really choose a person who is very fashionable it would be Lewis Hamilton.
I am a big fan of Formula 1 and every time I see him, his style is on point.
Q: A word of advice to aspiring male models.
A: Stay true to yourself and always keep your loved ones close.
Q: Have you already got some offers to act What kind of roles and films/teledramas would you like to do Are you considering a career or a part time career in acting
A: I havent got any offers that seem interesting enough so far. Since I am studying fulltime in Germany from September onwards it will be hard to pursue a career in acting but if I had the chance I would love to do a remake of the series Fresh Prince of Bel Air. (Laughs) But I am pretty open minded to roles. I believe that a great actor should be able to fit himself into any kind of role.
Q: What are you upcoming plans
A: Finishing my studies is my main goal. Then I will see what offers are in store for me. I will continue doing what I love and see where it takes me.

## Title: Saga of Aris 13

Saga of Aris 13
Its so funny that Aris 13 was hijacked on March 13. Sri Lankans are always skeptical about using number 13.
Many of us, on TV, watched with sadness, the plight of family members of the crew of Aris 13, a sea going vessel which was hijacked on Monday March 13. Two days later, I watched on TV, a media briefing in which, the staff of the Director General of Merchant Shipping telling the nation about the action taken by them and the incident. What struck me most was, when they said the vessel was anchored off Djibouti. I presume it was a very senior officer of the Directorate. The highlights were full of inaccuracies and half truths. It is wrong for responsible authorities, to make factually incorrect statements. By then, the whole world, other than Sri Lanka, probably, did know what had happened and where the vessel was. Therefore, I thought it would be worth trying to educate the public. In other words, to strike while the iron is still hot.
The vessel, Aris 13 is a bunkering tanker with a gross tonnage of 1188, draft of 4.6 metres and a speed of about 5 knots. Its IMO registration is 9012501, flying the Comoros Islands flag. Normally, known as a low and slow vessel due to its speed and low draft and as such very vulnerable to pirate attacks. The vessel is believed to have left Colombo harbour on January 28, 2017. It was an all Sri Lankan crew, of which five had signed Articles, which is a mandatory requirement for seafarers. The rest of the crew had not done so. The vessel was moving from Djibouti to Mogadishu in Somalia. They were sailing close to the coast of Somalia carrying fuel. There were no security personnel on board and the crew may have not been aware of the looming episode.
The hijacking
As per reports from related sources and the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), the vessel had passed a SOS message on Monday, saying they were being followed by two skiffs. The vessel had then switched off its tracking system and disappeared. Later it was revealed that the vessel had been taken to a small coastal port known as Alula, in the autonomous Somali state of Puntland, in the Horn of Africa. Puntland remains, part of Somalia but autonomous since 1998 unlike Somaliland. Initial reports indicated that the hijackers claimed they were fishermen who were disgruntled that foreigners were poaching in their sea. The District Commissioner of Alula, Ali Shire Mohammed Osman had promised to take action. Meanwhile the EU NAVFOR from the European Union deployed their assets to monitor the situation. By Friday, the Sri Lankan State had taken positive steps to take control of the situation. All credit to the State, the State of Puntland and the rest of those who contributed, to save the lives and vessel. Probably diplomacy was at its best in a very murky situation.
Sea piracy
The safety of sea lanes and the supply chain is nothing new in the world of commerce, so is piracy. In the current context, sea lanes connect all continents and logistic movement across the globe. In recent years, Somali sea piracy, which actually is part of organised crime, took centre stage in security matters. As a result of piracy, extending to a large area and becoming a major threat to international commerce, there arose a need for a global response.
In 2008, the UN Security Council formally condemned all acts of Piracy and Armed Robbery off Somalias coast and resorted to its first action by adopting Resolution 1816. The Resolution called on states to use all necessary means to repress acts of piracy and robbery at sea. In 2013 the UN adopted Resolution 2125, to tighten anti piracy measures Meanwhile the IMO responded by its circulars 1333, 1334, 1405 and 1406. Much was also done by both state and non state actors, following these initiatives, to counter the threat and menace. The High Risk Area (HRA) became the geographical battle ground. By about 2011, Somali pirates had launched about 237 attacks off the coast of Somalia and the global cost of piracy was about 8 billion USD. About 80% of this cost was borne by the shipping industry, which included higher insurance premiums, ransoms, security and other expenses. There was a time that a hijacked vessel could fetch a ransom of about 6 million USD. By that time, the pirates held 736 hostages and 32 ships. That was during the heyday of the Somali warlords. However, there had not been any major attacks since about 2012, other than about four attempted attacks. The role of Private Maritime Security Companies (PMSCs), intervention by regional naval forces and international cooperation improved the security of the strategic sea route which connected traffic from the South China Sea through the Suez Canal to Europe. The last known incident was, when a crew of 17 Iranians, were taken hostage. Four are believed to have died, four rescued and only eight remained.
Horn of Africa
I heard about the region, as a schoolboy whilst studying Geography. Back then, it was told that the region was the gateway to Asia. Arab traders had ventured into Asia from this important point and eventually it became a trade and commerce hub. Subsequently, it became a strategic point, with the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. The Bab el Mandep straits which has a width of about 30 KMs, divides Yemen and Djibouti. This strategic link, connects the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Suez and the Mediterranean Sea. Almost 5 million barrels of oil pass through this point daily. Such is its importance. The area is considered to be one of the most important choke points in the shipping industry. Interestingly, the vessel Iris 13 was hijacked close to this area. The region is also considered to be a conflict area in recent times. Countries in the region are Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia in the South and Yemen in the North.
Djibouti, which was said to be the place where the vessel was anchored (which of course was not true) is the safari grounds for high paying sovereign states. The American, German, Japanese, French, Italian and Spanish militaries all have military presence in the country to protect their assets in the region, including shipping. Soon the Chinese too will join the fray in opening up a base. So, seven militaries will be crammed up in this country of 1 million people, to project their military power from thousands of KMs away from their homelands. In addition, the European Union Naval Force operation, Atalanta also known as EU NAVFOR has been in operation since December 2008 in the region. Such is the current state of military and naval assets in the region.
Whilst various news reports and views were being expressed over the incident, as mentioned before, some interesting opinions too were expressed. Someone asked, whether it was not possible for the Sri Lankan Navy to rescue them. Such was the concern and naivety. Another view which was expressed and given prominence over the web and media was that it was possible for an individual to seek their release if the State of Sri Lanka approached him. And many believed that story like all other stories.
One media organisation went to the extent of taking credit for its reporting. Its not unusual for reportage to be biased, one sided and to the advantage of individuals. The State media for a change, on Friday, gave some worthwhile reportage on the incident.
Concerns
Some important possibilities need to be brought out at this juncture to safeguard the lives of people, assets and the credibility of the State of Sri Lanka.
Regularise the departure of all sea going personnel from Sri Lanka with more control measures.
At present there are a number of personnel going as crews in general and as security personnel in particular, from Sri Lanka without any restriction. These include foreigners. Eventually, when an incident of this nature takes place, the State has to intervene. If it fails, the responsibility is on the State. Building and developing diplomatic ties in this region in a very positive manner. This action could be a long term investment though costly. This can be seen from the investment made by other nations.
State media to be more pro active in its approach, to situations such as this. Although the saga ended with comfort to the families and the Nation, the loss of lives if it happened, would have been tragic and sad.
Improved communications between Sri Lankan authorities and international bodies including IMO and other non state actors.
The story of Iris 13 hijacked on March 13, will be a case study for those involved in naval studies although the vessel had breached all best practices of security. It will be an eye opener for the shipping industry which is very lax on current security threats and the pirates themselves. It will also be a victory for international diplomacy.

## Title: SAITM issue : Towards a politically-managed middle path

SAITM issue : Towards a politically-managed middle path
While South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) undergoes the debate of To be or not to be, Deputy Minister of Mass Media and Parliamentary Affairs Karunarathna Paranawithana has proposed that we adopt the middle path to solve the problem.
Have SAITM under the State university system as a fee-levying institution, he said in an interview with Daily News, and explained that the situation needed to be politically-managed soon, before it got out of control.
Excerpts follow:
Q. What do you think is the governments current plan of action for SAITM
A. The government has to wait for the Supreme Courts decision. The medical council has appealed the decision of the Court of Appeal, so we have to wait until the Supreme Court decides on it. Until then, the government cannot take any decision. Those who are protesting against SAITM dont seem to understand this.
The court will, however, only look at the procedural issues in this, but I believe that there are some policy issues which need to be sorted out first in this matter.
Q. What kind of policy issues
A. There is polarization in society between the pro-SAITM group and the anti-SAITM group. Both ends propose extreme solutions which is not healthy. I personally believe that SAITM is a crooked entity which was started through the personal contacts Dr. Neville Fernando had with the previous regime. It was not properly established, and at present, its integrity has been challenged.
Such an institution should not exist. But on the other side, those who oppose SAITM do not want to resolve this issue. They want to take this fight on to the streets until finally, someone is killed. They want to topple the government by using this issue.
But I believe that we need an alternative solution to this problem. This is my solution: have SAITM absorbed into the state university system as a fee-levying institute. The best option, thus, would be to convert SAITM to the Medical Faculty of the Open University. The Open University is a government-owned fee-levying university; their law degree is offered on a fee-levying basis.
Student selection then can be done through the University Grants Commission (UGC). Those who do exceptionally well at their Advanced Level exam can be chosen on merit to other universities, those with minimum qualifications, but were not selected due to the district quota system, can go to this.
Those with minimum qualifications and can afford to pay can also go here.
Those who have been discriminated against as a result of the district quota system and cannot afford to pay, can have access to a government student loan scheme, which they can pay back once they start earning as doctors. I am sure they would all be able to pay it once they become doctors. Foreign students can also come to this university. This is the long term-answer. In the short term, you need to think of the students that are currently registered at SAITM. Contrary to what people say, most of them are qualified students, and they should be given the medical degree.
To get the license, they need to sit for a Medical Council exam, either the EPRM or any other exam specified by the Medical Council. We can also have required legal reforms to enable that. There is also an understanding that the clinical training of these graduates is a bit weak, thus the internship period can be extended to give them more time to practice. At present, the government medical colleges have the internship set at one year, for SAITM, we can have it increased to two. By adopting this alternative, we can solve this issue. We are not curtailing free education in this country, rather, we want to expand it. We can even introduce two other medical universitiesone in Sabaragamuwa and the other in Wayamba.
We are also not cutting the proportion allocated for free education, and neither are we asking the people who have the minimum qualifications and the money, to go abroad to complete their studies. This will save valuable foreign exchange for the country while ensuring that the free education system continues.
The most serious problem with SAITM was the issue of standards and regulations, thus, when it is within the State university system, standards which all other universities follow can be applied to this and closely monitored.
Q. SAITM has been in existence since 2008, and consecutive governments, even the incumbent, have not really taken steps to solve the issue. Why do you think this is so
A. Actually, there was no issue earlier because all groups concerned agreed with it. When it was first established, neither the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), nor the students protested over it. All knew it was a crooked deal. When Kotalawala Defence University too, got a medical faculty, none opposed.
They were too scared to oppose then, but now, with the change in government, all these cardboard heroes have come forward to protest.
The other issue was that in this country, there was no coherent debate on the policy on higher education. In developed countries, education is not a commodity. If you take Oxford University or Harvard, University of London, Cambridge, you pay a lot to study, but they are not profit making, they are maintained by trusts. But if you take India, they started private medical colleges, and after many years, one of their Health Secretaries, Sujatha Rao, says that the biggest error committed by the Indian government since Independence was the privatization of medical education. So nowhere in the world can you see private medical colleges succeeding, once they are in tune with market forces.
On the other hand, there is also a certain myth that is being propagated under the name of free education, which is the Kannangara Education system. Under the Kannangara system, you can have fee-levying schools. But the students who protest have come to believe that an education system has to be completely free, and if not, it will cease to exist. This is a baseless argument.
The free education system was really started during the Dutch period; during the British, it expanded. It was given by force, parents who did not send their children to school were punished. But it was not a national education; it had no national goal.
Then, Kannangara introduced a national framework for education and opened up many free schools. But he did not suggest that all fee-levying schools should be closed. Schools such as St Thomas, St Joseph, Bishops College, Trinity College, etc. all remained. Thereafter, during Madam Sirimavo Bandaranaikes time, there was public acquisition of schools, but even then, around 40 odd schools remained under the control of private entities. Those schools, at the same time, are not profit making.
I do not say that only free education should exist in this country. We need fee-levying schools, but at the same time, education should not be turned into a commodity. There should be strict regulations by the government to monitor them.
Q. There are many private colleges in existence already, but why do you think there is so much opposition just for medical We even have law degrees that are offered by private institutes, and a bad lawyer is just as dangerous.
A. Yes, those who oppose private medical, even the students are very much silent on other fronts.
The students do not oppose tuition classes, and many who have been selected to university have done so by attending multiple tuition classes. Once they get to university, many even take tuition classes to earn extra money. That is all private.
Then, some while obtaining a degree at a government university, go to private colleges to study their degrees like CIMA. That is the hypocrisy. But I believe this sector should be scrutinized and regulated. I am for fee-levying education, but my argument is that standards have to be maintained and regulated.
Q. Minister of Higher Education Lakshman Kiriella has said that they expect to introduce a system of monitoring quality for all universities soon. Do you think the problem would be solved after that
A. No, that alone would not solve the issue. The issue of commodification of education would still persist. Market forces cannot determine the path of higher education.
Q. The government also wants to bring in other private medical colleges such as Manipal University to Sri Lanka. Do they hope that if SAITM works out, others too, can come in
A. That is not advisable. Look what happened to India. I do not oppose private universities, bring them, but do not commodify education.
Q. Do you think there is also a fear that if SAITM is shut down, then you would close the door for all other private medical universities, and thus, there is a certain determination to make SAITM work
A. No, we have many private universities in Sri Lanka already, but medical education is special because you cannot teach forensic medicine without forming certain links with the government.
It is the same with other countries. I do not think the medical profession is above all other professions, but medical education has certain unique features which make it necessary that it is highly regulated.
In this country, I recommend that medical education come under the state system, but whether it is offered free or not has to be decided. If it is fee-levying, others will also get the chance, so why do we need others to come in
Q. But isn't the Minister of Higher Education saying he wants others to come in
A. He says that, but they are all in the same old debate. Look at the current situation in Sri Lanka and study our history.
Q. Would you say this is a repetition of what happened with the North Colombo Medical College
A. Yes, at that time too, the courts gave the judgement in favour of the North Colombo Medical College. The government could have been satisfied with that, but what happened after It led to a big calamity, and many people died.
Q. So you think the government will have to take the same steps as before to manage SAITM
A. No, I dont think so but we have to politically manage this situation and come up with the alternative.
Q. If the government was to take over SAITM, will you have a lot of objection from people like Dr. Neville Fernando
A. I dont think so. He is already asking to nationalize the hospital. Why is that Because they cannot run it. We can take the hospital as a public-private partnership hospital and can share the profit.
The faculty, however, can be taken over by the state, and relevant compensation given as it is a fee-levying university.
Q. If you take the example of the North Colombo Medical College once again, the founders of the institute later complained that the government never paid them their promised compensation. Would the same fear be here
A. That cannot be accepted. They want the government to take over the hospital, but they still want to reap the profits off SAITMthat cannot be. By trying to continue with this crooked entity, they are trying to rob the country of its money. We cannot tolerate that; this would encourage others to practice in similar actions.
Q. Do the student groups who oppose this allege that the government is trying to protect SAITM
A. Those students who are on the streets cannot understand the concept of free education. How can they understand what the government is doing We want a just solution.
Q. Has the President appointed a committee to look into this
A. Yes, that is to look into alternatives. If we already have a solutionif the answer is therethe President would not have to appoint a committee, so this shows that we clearly have a problem and need alternatives.
Q. As the Deputy Minister of Mass Media, do you think the government has a problem in not being able to communicate its stance to the protesters
A. We actually dont have an agreed stance. If you looked at the Parliamentary debate on it, some ministers argued in favour of the previous governments SAITM formula, and then some came out and said this was completely wrong. Members such as I, have put forward this formula.
At the same time, some have kept silent on the matter while others have no opinion on it at all. So the discussions are going on.
There is no agreed solution, so we need to create a debate on the viable alternatives.
Q. Isnt that the problem No agreed stance
A. Stances do not just appear, it has to be discussed. There needs to be a wider debate on this.
Q. Until that time, would many be carrying out their protests unhindered
A. That is the nature of democracy.
Q. Do you think the students will accept such an alternative
A. We cannot accept what the students say. Their concern is to protect free education, but they do not care whether there is social justice for all.
The opportunities for free education at present are limited, so what happens to the others What kind of egalitarianism are they talking of
Q. Do you also think these are politically motivated
A. We are not afraid of those political forces; they do not have much power. It is very easy to organize protests in a close environment such as a university, and these students have very little social responsibility, so they are up for a protest.
But the students do have a concern, and that is to protect free education, and we are doing that.
We are now in touch with the students and are talking to them, but we will not tolerate any unlawful activity.

Scotland rout Italy to finish Six Nations in style
EDINBURGH, Saturday - A vibrant Scotland side ran in four tries to crush Italy 29-0 and give departing coach Vern Cotter a fitting send-off in their final Six Nations match at Murrayfield on Saturday.
Flyhalf Finn Russell, replacement centre Matt Scott and wingers Tim Visser and Tommy Seymour scored tries as the Scots earned a bonus-point win and protected their fifth place in the world rankings ahead of the 2019 World Cup draw. Italy, who lost all five matches in the tournament, failed to register a point as flyhalf Carlo Cana missed three penalties and the backs fluffed two clear try-scoring chances early in the second half.
The Scots, humbled 61-21 by England last weekend, climbed to second in the standings before the day's later matches after notching a fourth consecutive home win for the first time since 2006.
I would like to thank the players and everyone for the last three years it has been fun, New Zealander Cotter told the crowd in an emotional farewell.
Fullback Stuart Hogg got Scotland off the mark with a penalty after five minutes before Cana missed a chance to level when he pulled his kick wide from a good position.
That miss summed up Italys miserable afternoon even if it took the home side nearly half an hour for their first big breakthrough.
Following a penalty lineout, scrumhalf Ali Price passed to Russell on the blind side and the flyhalf darted between two defenders to score the first try.
Scotland changed ends 15-0 up after Scott, who had come on for the injured Huw Jones, touched down after Hogg had tapped back Prices chip into the corner.
Wooden spoon holders Italy should have scored a try soon after the break but a mixture of dogged Scottish defence and their own inept ball-handling out wide denied them. The visitors camped on the Scottish line for what seemed an age, earning five penalties as they repeatedly tried to force their way over from mauls and home captain John Barclay was sin-binned. But when Italy should have scored in the corner on two occasions, the backs were ponderous and butter-fingered in their passing and the chances went begging, something their Irish coach Conor OShea will have to work hard on.

## Title: SEC releases Capital Market Strategy 2020
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Monday, March 20, 2017 - 01:00
SEC releases Capital Market Strategy 2020
A vision for capital market development in Sri Lanka
The Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) releases the Capital Market Strategy 2020, a comprehensive transformative plan for Sri Lankas capital market, with the intention of providing strategic clarity to market participants and the general public.
The significance of ensuring the capital markets resilience has become more apparent during recent years of sustained global economic and market uncertainty, divergent growth, volatility, and other emergent challenges. In this context, the Capital Market Strategy 2020 reflects the SECs definitive force of continuity in engendering competitiveness and effective regulation in our capital market.
Focused capital market development initiatives have historically accelerated economic growth and contributed to financial sector stability in emerging economies. Such initiatives proved critical to economic growth amongst regional signifiers including Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, India, and China and those outside the region including South Africa, Poland, Morocco, Hungary, and Brazil.
In Sri Lanka, capital market development as measured by market capitalisation as a percentage of gross domestic product is 25.3%. In contrast, from amongst the above contenders, South Africa, and, closer to home, Malaysia and India, reflect ratios of 234.0%, 129.3%, and 72.4% respectively.
The overview of the Capital Market Strategy 2020 below charts its core themes of establishing a robust and facilitative regulatory environment and fostering capital market development.
In shaping the Capital Market Strategy 2020, we are influenced by the need for regulatory strength and readiness and our ability to effectively deliver governance, enforcement and compliance. The current realities of capital markets necessitate an increasingly more proactive and responsive regulatory action. Further, due to the interconnectedness of markets and global nature, regulation assumes a more pervasive scope and requires progressive benchmarking against international best practice.
The developmental objectives focus on the several constraints characterising our market - its small size and scarcity of liquidity, limited diversification in product offering from an investors perspective, and in listing platforms from an issuers. Additionally, we consider the efficiency and commercial orientation of market institutions, market infrastructure and technology gaps, and community capacity building extending to both the institution and industry.
Strengthening Regulatory and Governance Environment
The amendment of the SEC Act is among the key initiatives geared towards strengthening the domestic regulatory and governance environment. The enhancement of the SEC regulatory framework and capabilities includes the strengthening of the governance standards of the SEC, providing for the establishment of a clearing house acting as a central counterparty (CCP), regulating demutualised exchanges, recognising new categories of market intermediaries, introducing a wide range of enforcement tools to deal with market misconduct, enhancing the accountability of all capital market participants, and encouraging early reporting to the SEC on possible market malpractice through provisions for whistleblower protection.
The passage of this Act would be pivotal to a series of incremental steps, beginning with Sri Lankas adherence to minimum international standards in capital market regulation and extending to an alignment of the domestic regulatory framework with international benchmarks. The SEC considers an enabling regulatory environment as being of foundational importance in creating a level playing field that instills trust and confidence among the varied market participants.
In 2016, the SEC extended an invitation to the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), the global standard-setter for securities market regulation, to conduct a Country Review of Sri Lanka. This was done with a view to assessing the present capital market regulatory framework, identifying gaps in compliance with 37 Principles of Securities Regulation and developing a roadmap for enhanced compliance.
The Country Review was preceded by a detailed self-assessment to facilitate timely completion within the first quarter of 2017 and would result in comprehensive reforms following the publication of its findings. Such reforms would include reviews of rules applicable to the capital market as well as measures to enhance investor protection, improve fairness and market efficiency, reduce systemic risk and global regulatory arbitrage, reduce the costs of conducting business across borders, and improve domestic regulatory capability. It is widely anticipated that such reforms would lay a solid foundation for the Sri Lankan capital market and improve its ability to garner the interest of domestic and foreign institutional portfolio investors.
Rules applicable to all regulatees of the SEC are currently undergoing review and revision with a view to creating a more robust regulatory environment for all and instilling greater discipline market-wide.
Further, the the domestic Corporate Governance Code applicable to listed companies is scheduled to be aligned with principles published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the international reference point for corporate governance regulation and implementation; thus improving the business integrity of listed companies.
Going forward, listed companies would also be encouraged to adopt integrated reporting, a framework that provides a holistic view of the corporate value creation process.
Increasing Accountability and Market Oversight
The SEC places significance on the procurement of a technologically advanced system for market surveillance and regulatory reporting to ensure that transactions are carried out in compliance with the rules governing capital market activity. Such a system would enable the SEC to detect and deter potential market abuse and enhance its ability to pre-empt the occurrence of disruptions in the market as a result of irregular trading activity.
It is also proposed to cast duties on supplementary service providers including those hitherto unregulated by the SEC. This is to ensure that such persons remain accountable for the scope and quality of work performed in relation to the capital market. The SEC also hopes to extend its regulatory reach to encompass other hitherto-unregulated entities and instruments.
Raising the Standards and Competencies of Capital Market Participants
The Capital Market Strategy 2020 proposes to enhance and maintain high levels of professionalism among persons engaged in capital market activity by enhancing the guidelines on fitness and propriety applicable to market institutions and market intermediaries. At the same time, it is envisaged that the qualification framework of the SEC would undergo extensive revision, allowing for multi-tier licensing and continuous professional development
These new guidelines would drive a positive industry culture encouraging honesty and integrity among the regulatees of the SEC so as to better protect the investing public.
Mitigating and Managing Systemic Risk
In order to better evaluate and address systemic risk, the SEC intends to adopt a risk-weighted capital adequacy framework for capital market institutions and intermediaries. This initiative is now underway, following the recent issue of Directives by the SEC stipulating risk-based capital adequacy requirements and the minimum shareholders funds requirement applicable to stock brokers. The development of a risk-based assessment framework for on-site supervision by the SEC would follow. Once such a framework is developed, SEC would conduct inspections of its regulatees in relation to their relative risk profiles and systemic importance.
Prevailing post-trade risks including asset commitment risk and counterparty risk would be effectively addressed, and financial stability improved upon, through the phased implementation of a CCP. The SEC directs the course of the sequential approach, prioritising the implementation of Delivery vs. Payment for settlement and the adoption of Value at Risk based margining (VaR) to mitigate post-trade risk. Extensive consultation with specialists and the industry has led to the determination of both the margining and settlement framework in detail. The SEC would be creating an enabling legal framework in line with acceptable international benchmarks to enable post trade risk management and related initiatives including the introduction of securities borrowing and lending.
Creating an enabling environment for capital formation
The SEC envisions a vibrant capital market attracting strong issuer participation from both the private sector and State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) as a preferred source of long-term fundraising. Representations have been made to the Government of Sri Lanka in exploring the potentiality of invigorating the capital market through the listing of SOEs with compelling investment propositions. Entry by SOEs into the capital market engenders less dependence on State financing whilst enhancing governance standards. The CSE is encouraged to engage with private sector corporates in order to facilitate their efforts to tap the capital market to fulfill funding requirements.
The implementation of new listing platforms for issuers of varied size, scale, maturity, and value-recognition needs is underway collaboratively with the CSE. The Multi Currency Board would enable local and foreign issuers to explore multi currency listings, whilst small and medium enterprises (SMEs) would be provided access via the SME Board. The SEC along with the CSE is also keen to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the equity fundraising process through both operational and technological enhancements.
Creating a robust bond market is a significant component of the Capital Market Strategy 2020. SEC-led collaborative representations in recent years secured tax concessions supporting bond market issuances. As a result, inflows to the primary debt market reached an all-time high in 2015, with Rs. 83.4 Bn being raised through debt IPOs.
Other strategies related to the debt capital market also include the streamlining of the bond IPO process, infrastructural enhancements to support enhanced secondary market activity, and stewardship of joint stakeholder engagements to facilitate liquidity. Collectively, the initiatives aim to enhance the competitiveness of the debt market as a source of financing in a market which traditionally relies on equity.
Deepening liquidity and broad-basing market participation
The Capital Market Strategy 2020 aims to establish the capital market as a preferred investment choice by a broad range of investors. As an important conduit and enabler of retail investment, unit trusts are pivotal to this strategy.
The SEC works towards supporting the unit trust industry by cultivating a conducive environment and creating awareness among the general public in order to ensure that a wider segment of society can reap the medium to long-term benefits and rewards of investing in the capital market through unit trust investments.
The SEC seeks to actively engage provident funds and pension funds in diversifying their portfolios and increasing asset allocation to capital market investments. Increased participation by such long-term institutional investors can improve market stability and sustainability, as a result of their holding power and ability to act in a counter-cyclical manner.
Traditionally having significant exposure to government securities, these funds could optimise portfolio returns and extend maturity profiles to provide better asset-liability matching through calculated investment in the market.
At present, with the broad-basing of market participation in mind, minimum public holding thresholds apply to listed companies upon initial listing, and enforced thereafter on a continuous basis. The SEC would drive requisite policy formulation for the introduction of short-selling, securities borrowing and lending, and other new products in order to deepen liquidity.
Developing infrastructure and enabling new products
Technological readiness, responsiveness and stability are material strategic considerations for market institutions and market participants.
Headway has been made in this regard with the SEC driving the implementation of a common stock broker back office and customised order management systems in conjunction with the CSE.
Resulting in operational efficiency and streamlining of the trade-through-settlement value chain, the initiative sets the infrastructural foundation for the proposed phased implementation of a CCP.
The implementation process constitutes modification of and additions to systems and processes industry-wide, particularly by redefining the CSEs market infrastructure at world-class level.
To increase portfolio choice of investors, the SEC is developing a sequencing framework for the introduction of new products ranging from Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) to Financial Derivatives. The SEC would enable the introduction of a multi-asset offering for investors by spearheading policy formulation in order to facilitate related rule making by the CSE.
Building domestic capabilities
The SEC will facilitate comprehensive community capacity building. Institutional competencies of the SEC are to be enhanced through measures to recruit and retain a proficient workforce. Industry capacity-building focuses on enhancing the financial literacy and capital market expertise of all stakeholders in relation to the capital market, and continuous investor education and public awareness-raising to equip investors with the knowledge required to make informed investment decisions.
The proposed demutualisation of the CSE is a central initiative of building domestic capability through the re-orientation of the CSE to pursue strategic and commercial interests. Demutualisation segregates ownership and management of the CSE in order to adequately represent the interests of all capital market stakeholders. The CSEs business model would be reviewed in the process to optimise financial sustainability. Institutional competence and global acceptability of the CSE is expected to be enhanced through demutualisation, the modality of which is currently being finalised.
Over the medium to long term, far-reaching reforms proposed as part of the Capital Market Strategy 2020 would support the proposition to Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) to reclassify Sri Lanka as an emerging market, providing for broader visibility as an attractive portfolio investment destination.
Implementation
The expansive scope of the Capital Market Strategy 2020 necessitates prioritisation, with goals ranging from immediate to medium and long term. With the intent of increasing transparency, significant milestones would be communicated to the public over the implementation horizon.
Broad market and public consultation outreach would be in effect during the implementation.
Public consultations were conducted in January 2017 in view of the proposed SEC Act and the proposed Guidelines on Fitness and Propriety for Stock Brokers, while an industry consultation on the proposed Advertising Guidelines for Unit Trusts was conducted in November 2016. Further consultation can be expected as other development initiatives progress.
We recognise that in order to implement the initiatives under consideration, the SEC would need to align multiple stakeholders with divergent interests towards universal goals. While the auspices of the Government of Sri Lanka has been secured for the Capital Market Strategy 2020, its successful implementation also anticipates collaborative and complementary alliances with regulators, supranational organisations, market institutions, market participants, and industry associations.
The SEC, in redefining the competitive position of the market, is committed to aligning its role as a responsive market regulator with the significant opportunities present before it.

The Capital Market Strategy 2020 is now accessible via the SEC website,www.sec.gov.lk

Sesame Street to debut Julia, a muppet with autism

Its much-loved muppets Big Bird, Cookie Monster, and Oscar the Grouch have been charming viewers for almost 50 years.
And now the children's TV show Sesame Street is introducing a new muppet character with a simpler name, and a tougher brief.
Julia, a little girl, has orange hair, a toy rabbit - and autism. She will make her Sesame Street TV debut in April on US channels HBO and PBS.
The characteris already included in digital and printed storybooks.
However, bosses want to step up her role.
Autism diagnoses have risen steadily in recent years to a rate of one in every 68 US children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But explaining the topic to a young audience is far from straightforward.
'She ignores Big Bird'
"The big discussion right at the start was, 'How do we do this How do we talk about autism'" Sesame Street writer Christine Ferraro told the CBS News show 60 Minutes.
"It's tricky because autism is not one thing, because it is different for every single person who has autism."
In her debut episode, Julia will demonstrate some common characteristics. When Big Bird is introduced to her, she ignores him.
Confused, Big Bird thinks "that maybe she didn't like me". But the other muppets tell him: "She does things just a little differently."
Later, when a group of children are playing tag, Julia starts jumping up and down with excitement.
"That's a thing that can be typical of some kids with autism," Ferraro said.
Instead of rejecting Julia, the children create a new game in which they all jump around together.
Julia's puppeteer, Stacey Gordon, happens to be the mother of an autistic son. She said the creation of an autistic muppet is "huge".
"Had my son's friends been exposed to his behaviours through something that they had seen on TV before they experienced them in the classroom, they might not have been frightened," she told 60 Minutes.
"They might not have been worried when he cried. They would have known that he plays in a different way, and that that's OK."
At this point it's not known if Julia will become a major character on the show, but Ferraro - who has been writing it for 25 years - is keen.
"I would love her to be not Julia, the kid on Sesame Street who has autism," she said. "I would like her to be just Julia."

Simple Gardening Tricks
Here are some tips to make gardening a breeze.
Little clay pots make great cloches for protecting young plants from overnight frosts.
1. To remove the salt deposits that form on clay pots, combine equal parts white vinegar, rubbing alcohol and water in a spray bottle. Apply the mixture to the pot and scrub with a plastic brush. Let the pot dry before you plant anything in it.
2. To prevent accumulating dirt under your fingernails while you work in the garden, draw your fingernails across a bar of soap and you'll effectively seal the undersides of your nails so dirt can't collect beneath them. Then, after you've finished in the garden, use a nailbrush to remove the soap and your nails will be sparkling clean.
3. To prevent the line on your string trimmer from jamming or breaking, treat with a spray vegetable oil before installing it in the trimmer.
4. Turn a long-handled tool into a measuring stick! Lay a long-handled garden tool on the ground, and next to it place a tape measure.
Using a permanent marker, write inch and foot marks on the handle. When you need to space plants a certain distance apart (from just an inch to several feet) you'll already have a measuring device in your hand.
More Tips and Tricks from Paul 04:28
How can you use bubble wrap to keep your potted plants from stressing out Find out from gardening expert Paul James.
5. To have garden twine handy when you need it, just stick a ball of twine in a small clay pot, pull the end of the twine through the drainage hole, and set the pot upside down in the garden. Do that, and you'll never go looking for twine again.
6. Little clay pots make great cloches for protecting young plants from sudden, overnight frosts and freezes.
7. To turn a clay pot into a hose guide, just stab a roughly one-foot length of steel reinforcing bar into the ground at the corner of a bed and slip two clay pots over it: one facing down, the other facing up.
The guides will prevent damage to your plants as you drag the hose along the bed.
8. To create perfectly natural markers, write the names of plants (using a permanent marker) on the flat faces of stones of various sizes and place them at or near the base of your plants.
9. Got aphids You can control them with a strong blast of water from the hose or with insecticidal soap. But here's another suggestion, one that's a lot more fun; get some tape! Wrap a wide strip of tape around your hand, sticky side out, and pat the leaves of plants infested with aphids. Concentrate on the undersides of leaves, because that's where the little buggers like to hide.
10. The next time you boil or steam vegetables, don't pour the water down the drain, use it to water potted patio plants, and you'll be amazed at how the plants respond to the "vegetable soup."
11. Use leftover tea and coffee grounds to acidify the soil of acid-loving plants such as azaleas, rhododendrons, camellias, gardenias and even blueberries. A light sprinkling of about one-quarter of an inch applied once a month will keep the pH of the soil on the acidic side.
12. Use chamomile tea to control damping-off fungus, which often attacks young seedlings quite suddenly. Just add a spot of tea to the soil around the base of seedlings once a week or use it as a foliar spray.
13. If you need an instant table for tea service, look no farther than your collection of clay pots and saucers. Just flip a good-sized pot over, and top it off with a large saucer. And when you've had your share of tea, fill the saucer with water, and your "table" is now a birdbath.
14. The quickest way in the world to dry herbs: just lay a sheet of newspaper on the seat of your car, arrange the herbs in a single layer, then roll up the windows and close the doors. Your herbs will be quickly dried to perfection. What's more, your car will smell great.

## Title: Solving a translation Puzzle

Solving a translation Puzzle
It started with an editorial query about a bag.
In Karolina Ramqvists novel The White City, a woman, Karin, has been left without resources after living a luxe life with her gangster husband, John, who is dead. Karins Swedish, middle-class family never approved of her decision to become a criminals housewife, so she cant go to them for help. The gangster family that was supposed to have her back has turned on her. She has no one but her nursing infant, and shes reluctant about motherhood. In the middle of a frozen Stockholm winter, Karin is being left out in the cold, figuratively and literally: the authorities are about to seize her grand suburban home. The reader meets her there, where signs of filth and decay abound. Theres no heating, no Internet. Desperate for cash, shes selling off her luxury handbags. The doorbell rings; a prospective buyer who has seen Karins ad has come to have a look:
The woman nodded and said she was going on vacation and this model was so practical for travel, smiled when Dream [the baby] waved in her direction, and asked if she [Karin] was on maternity leave.
Yes.
She managed another smile and held out the tote. Even the lining was in good condition, the subtle pattern brought to mind the patios of expensive restaurants and white sand.
So, are you selling any others
Yeah, Ive taken a few out. One lovely 2.55  Chanel.
The woman nodded. She scrutinized the bag, complimenting her on how well it had been cared for.
Though Ramqvist never tells the reader the bags brand or styleshe rarely mentions brands at allI was sure, when I was translating White City, that she had a specific one in mind. Perhaps knowing which bag it was would unlock something elusive about Karins character.
When our editor sent me notes on this draft of the translated manuscript, she flagged tote. She, too, wondered what kind. Tote doesnt quite communicate luxury, does it The kind that Karin would know so well Her query made me think of the thick cotton totes printed with images of Joan Didion or publishing-house logos. Maybe its a duffel bag she wondered. Something else Check with the author.
There were a number of these kinds of editorial queries, ranging from the landscape surrounding Karins mansion in a wealthy suburb and the style of tracksuit worn by her exbest friend to the types of garbage cans found around Stockholmall of them serving as cultural guideposts.
Id created a document and filled it with reference images so the author would have a sense of the pictures in my mind when I was translating. Many of my photos were spot on. The frozen lake rimmed with reeds Ramqvist said thats exactly how she pictured the lake outside Karins house. The tracksuit Indeed, it was a pink Juicy Couture. These reference images bridged the gap between imagination and language, helped make sure we were all on the same page, helped us both visualize the culture, social structures, and landscape in which the novel was forged.
Henry James recommended that a novelist should try to be one of the people on whom nothing is lost, and I wondered, working through this puzzle, where that leaves the translator. The phrase lost in translation came to mind, and I shuddered. Translators are exegetes, but with a special responsibility to the author in that the art of literary translation turns us into writers as well. As part of my attempt to be a person on whom nothing is lost, I was focusing on the details.
I looked back at what Karin said to the buyer. So spiky. I read the mention of Chanel as a barb; our protagonist adjusting her usual mode of speech, making it intelligible to another woman who might not speak in the same high-fashion codes. If the buyer is among those who refer to the iconic flap bag as a 2.55, Karin is subtly undermining her by clarifying that its Chanel, as though she assumes the woman wouldnt know what she means.
But what was the bag that had caught the buyers eyethe kind of bag that was practical for travel, that made her think of alfresco dining and white sand A bag big enough, as we find out later, to hold a CZ and bags of ammunition, a baby bottle and formula, pacifiers and some cash.
I was picturing a tote bag. But what kind Though there is an inevitable gap that exists between a novel in its original language and its translation, the texture of the culture, its cryptograms, its cool, all had to transcend this. I pressed my ear to the padlock, turned the dial slowly; I listened for the soft clicks that would give it away. I cycled through brands and considered their tote bagstheir exclusivity, who carried them and when. Longchamp, Michael Kors, House of Dagmar. No. Too common. Not yet proven to be timeless. Certainly not expensive enough to resell for a meaningful amount of cash.

Sri Lankas darkest hour in Test cricket-lose to Bangladesh
Sri Lanka has been a Test playing nation for 17 years and never have they suffered such humiliation as losing a Test match to a country ranked lower than them when Bangladesh won the second Test by four wickets to draw the two-match series played for the Joy Bangla trophy one-all at the P Sara Oval yesterday. Sri Lanka won the first Test played at Galle by 259 runs.
Chasing 191 for a historic win in their 100th Test, Bangladesh recovered from a mild hiccup when they lost two wickets at the score on 22 to post a handsome victory after tea on the fifth and final day with the winning hit coming off the bat of teenager Mehedi Hasan when he swept Sri Lanka skipper Rangana Herath to square leg for a couple to signal jubilation in the Bangladesh camp. Non striker Mushfiqur Rahim, the captain was so overjoyed that he ran across to hug his partner in celebration.
Mushfiqur Rahim the Bangladesh captain sets off for the winning runs that gave his team their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka in the second Test played at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
Only three countries have won their 100th Test before Bangladesh  Australia, West Indies and Pakistan. For Bangladesh this win was special because it showed how much they have improved as a Test nation. Yesterdays win comes on the back of their first Test victory against Alastair Cooks England achieved in October last year at Dhaka where Mushfiqur Rahims men drew the two-Test series 1-all.
By beating Sri Lanka away from home Bangladesh have proved that they are no longer the pushovers in Test cricket they used to be, but a team to be respected. It was their ninth win overall and their fourth overseas  after West Indies (2) and Zimbabwe (1) and first win over Sri Lanka in 18 attempts. Bangladesh displayed their character by coming from losing the first Test at Galle to turn tables on a Sri Lanka side that was expected to complete a 2-0 win of the series. What the one-all series draw reflects is that all is not well with Sri Lanka cricket despite the wealth of experts Sri Lanka Cricket has in their support staff hired at great expense. Unless some radical actions are taken and changes made to uplift their game Sri Lanka will struggle to beat teams like Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Ireland (in the ODIs) at international level. These countries deploying past cricketers and coaches from developed countries are fast catching up and Sri Lanka cannot find themselves lagging behind.
To be beaten in a home Test can be galling especially against Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will be licking their wounds of what might have been after letting their opponents off the hook on the third evening when Upul Tharanga spilled that vital catch at deep mid wicket that saw Shakib Al Hasan progress from 11 to 116 and help his team gain a valuable first innings lead of 129 that later turned out to be decisive.
Bangladeshs run chase was spearheaded by opener Tamim Iqbal who hit a superb 82 off 124 balls inclusive of seven fours and a six to take the Man of the Match award.
Tamim fell trying to force the pace which was not required at that moment because there was plenty of overs in hand for Bangladesh to press for the win. He attempted a big hit off Dilruwan Perera and holed out to long on where Dinesh Chandimal held on to a difficult catch.
Tamim figured in an important partnership of 109 for the third wicket with Sabbir Rahman (41) after Herath on his 39th birthday had threatened to create panic among the Bangladesh batting by snapping up the wickets of Soumya Sarkar (10) and Imrul Kayes (0) off successive deliveries to have them two down for 22.
However unlike in the past Bangladesh batsmen held their nerve although they lost a further three wickets in getting to their target.
It was important that skipper Mushfiqur remained in the middle until victory was achieved.
Sri Lanka added a 51 runs for their last two wickets before they were bowled out for 319. Their ninth wicket pair of Dilruwan Perera and Suranga Lakmal stretched their partnership to worth 80 runs  a new partnership record for the series before being parted.
The stand was ended by Perera being run out for a hard fought half century scored off 174 balls with six fours.
Lakmal was out soon afterwards holing out to Musaddaq Hossain for 42 scored off 48 balls (4 fours) giving Shakib four wickets in the innings. Shakib Al Hasan was named Man of the Series.
The two teams move to Dambulla to commence a three-match ODI series starting on March 25.

Sumanthiran insists on foreign judges
TNA Spokesman MP M A Sumanthiran, insisting on foreign judges in the judicial mechanism to inquire into the human rights violations during the last stage of war, called on the government not to renege on its promises to the international community.Speaking to the media following an event in Jaffna on Saturday, he said the government could not escape from fully implementing the 2015 UNHRC resolution.
Reacting to the recent comments by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister and the Justice Minister ruling out the possibility of appointing foreign judges under the Sri Lankan laws, Sumanthiran said there is no such legal barrier for the move. He said even if such a barrier exists, the government should remove it and fulfill its international pledges.
Sumanthiran asked if there was a legal barrier in appointing foreign judges as the Foreign Minister claims now, why it was not stated when co-sponsoring the 2015 Resolution. The Prime Minister himself brought out the several past instances where foreign judges had been allowed in the country, he pointed out.
During the time of the impeachment of Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, Dr Wijayadasa Rajapakshe presented a private members motion proposing an inquiry with the participation of commonwealth judges. What he says now is contradictory to his previous stance, he remarked.
There is an agreement Sri Lanka signed in front of 47 States committing itself to a certain course of action. Unlike the pre-election promises, the government cannot escape from these international obligations. The government can learn a lesson from the repercussions former President Mahinda Rajapaksa faced for not keeping to the UN agreement signed in 2009, he said.
Sumanthiran further pointed out that revising Sri Lankan laws was necessary when setting up a judicial mechanism, because some offences considered crimes under the international law are not recognized as crimes under the Sri Lankan law.

Treasure hunters nabbed
A retired Air Force officer and three others who went treasure hunting to unearth riches which one of them had seen in his dreams were arrested by the Police.
The retired officer, a Kattadiya (Exorcist), and two others which included the land owner where the treasure is said to be buried in the Kalattewa area, Anuradhapura, were caught in the act. The landowner in Kalattewa is said to have seen the buried treasure in his dreams and had sought the help of the retired Air Force office to unearth it.
According to the Police, they had dug several holes in the land but had failed to unearth any treasure. The suspects had been nabbed with the equipment they had used in the treasure hunting.
Investigating are continuing.

Treating MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE
The aim of this article is to provide the reader with a clear and concise summary of what medical negligence is. Hence, this short article is focused more on medical matters than the legal concepts of negligence.
Negligence is a lay term common to any profession, occupation, trade, business or affair. It is a civil law concept extensively discussed in the law of delicts. In simple language, it means doing something that a prudent person would not do or not doing something that a prudent person would do and thereby causing damage to a third party. For example, a prudent driver will never want to speed his motor car along the opposite direction on a crowded one way road to run down a schoolchild of tender years on a level crossing. When it comes to medical practice, medical negligence could be explained as doing something that a prudent doctor would not do or not doing something that a prudent doctor would do in the care of patients and thereby causing damages to the patient. To prove (medical) negligence four components have to be established. They are:
1. Duty of care towards the patient
2. Breach of this duty of care
3. Causation of damages to the patient
4. A direct nexus (causal relationship) between 2 and 3
The doctor should owe a duty of care towards the patient. In medical practice, this is usually represented by the established doctor-patient relationship. This is a strictly professional relationship between a doctor and a patient. Though the doctor-patient relationship is a contractual relationship, documentary evidence is not essential to prove the same. Yet, if documentary evidence (such as bed-head-ticket entries, medical certificates, prescriptions, channeled consultation documents, investigations ordered by the doctor, medical or surgical equipment bought under the instructions of the doctor etc) are available, then it is easier to prove the existence of this duty of care.
This duty of care should be breached by the doctor. This is termed lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in medical practice. In medical ethics, we talk about highest degree of care and skill towards every patient. Yet, to constitute medical negligence the courts expect a more reasonable and realistic approach from the doctors by expecting only a reasonable degree of care and skill. This clause has been extensively discussed in case laws on medical negligence throughout the world.
The expectations of the courts also differ from time to time and from country to country. Different tests have been devised by courts in this respect though the writer does not wish to discuss them in detail. Interested readers are encouraged to refer to few famous English cases such as Hunter V. Hanley (1955) SLT 231 at 217, Bolam V. Friern Hospital Management Committee (1957) 1 WLR 582, Maynard V. West Midlands Regional Health Authority (1985) 1 All ER 635, Bolitho V. City and Hackney Health Authority (1996) 4 All ER 771 and Adams V. Rhymney Valley DC (2000) Lloyds Rep. P.N. 777 (41). In a medical point of view, a reasonable degree of care and skill could vary on several matters. Firstly, it varies on the level of education and experience of the attending doctor. It is common sense that the reasonable degree of care and skill expected of an intern house officer with only the basic medical degree and no clinical experience is different from that expected from a consultant with several decades of clinical experience when both attend the same case. Secondly, it differs upon the available facilities.
For example, the reasonable degree of care and skill expected from the same consultant attending the same type of case in two different stations, one being a tertiary care teaching hospital with all modern facilities and the other being a rural hospital in a remote area with bare minimum facilities, would be definitely different.
Thirdly, this differs on the situation too. For example, assume a condition where the same consultant surgeon, in the same hospital attending the same type of operation (for example amputation of the leg below knee joint) under two different situations. One is an elective surgery upon a patient admitted from the diabetic clinic with a chronic non-healing gangrene of foot while the other one is a life-saving emergency operation where a pedestrian is admitted in shock stage with extensive haemorrhage following a run-over traffic accident. The reasonable degree of care and skill a medical man could exercise in an emergency situation may be at a lesser level than in attending an elective procedure performed at leisure with enough prior preparation and planning.
The lack of reasonable degree of care and skill could be by doing something (commission) or by not doing something (omission). For example giving penicillin to a patient with a known allergy to the same drug is a commission while not giving Rhogum injection to a Rhesus negative woman who had delivered a Rhesus positive baby is an omission.
These commissions or omissions could occur at any stage/step in medical management ie: history taking, examination, investigation, treatment or follow-up. For example not extracting a vital piece of information which will be materially significant in medical decision making for the care of the patient, while obtaining the history could be considered as lack of reasonable degree of care and skill. If the attending doctor fails to examine the abdomen and elicit basic clinical features of tenderness, guarding, rigidity etc in a surgical casualty with acute abdomen, that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in clinical examination.
If the doctor fails to order an ECG on a middle-aged, hypertensive, diabetic male coming with a classical retrosternal chest pain, that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in the investigation. If a diagnosed patient with purulent meningitis is put only on a simple oral antibiotic, that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in treatment. If a woman undergone mastectomy for a highly malignant form of breast cancer is not followed up in the surgical clinic after discharging from the hospital that is a lack of reasonable degree of care and skill in follow-up.
The third fact needs to be proved for a successful litigation in medical negligence is the causation of damages to the patient. These damages could vary from death (loss of life) to a variety of other conditions to the patient or in the case of a minor to its parents.
How much ever the doctors actions are unacceptable and below the normal standards, if no damage is caused, there is no ground for medical negligence litigation. For example, a VOG fails to diagnose pregnancy induced hypertension or gestational diabetes in a pregnant woman. Yet, she delivers a healthy baby on term without any harm to the mother or the baby. In this situation, there is no ground for a charge of medical negligence.
The final (fourth) component is the nexus or the causal relationship between the doctors behaviour and the damages. In other words, a direct causal relationship between the doctors commission or omission and the damages incurred to the patient has to be established. This becomes fairly complicated at times.
The legal concepts of the theory of causation and remoteness of damage etc. are not discussed here. If the damages are not directly as a result of the doctors behaviour, then there should be no charge of medical negligence.
In other words, all four of the above mentioned components have to be proved to establish medical negligence. This was the basis of the Supreme Court decision in the famous Arseculeratne v. Priyani Soysa case. The brain stem glioma the child had suffered was inoperable and was necessarily fatal. Even if the condition had been correctly diagnosed at the initial stage, that does not change the outcome. So, the outcome was independent of the doctors behaviour.
At this point, one important fact has to be emphasized. An error of judgment does not necessarily amount to lack of reasonable degree of care and skill. This is a matter better understood by the men and women of medical profession than the lawyers, engineers, mathematicians, or statisticians. We, doctors, mostly use the hypothetico-deductive method in arriving at a provisional diagnosis. It is an evidence-based method of narrowing down your bunch of possibilities by ruling out certain conditions based upon the information you gather from history, clinical examination and investigations.
The human body does not always comply with mathematical frames. Therefore, if the doctors approach to a particular disease presentation is rational and acceptable that itself shows the exercise of a reasonable degree of care and skill. A precise diagnosis or a perfect cure cannot be guaranteed at all times. We must say and say firmly that in the professional man, an error of judgment is not negligent, said Lord Denning in Whitehouse v. Jordan which was affirmed by Lord Fraser in the House of Lords in the same case as that an error of judgment is not necessarily negligent.
This was in keeping with our Supreme Court judgment in Priyani Soysa case though the District Judge went on to claim that in his opinion, misdiagnosis is no diagnosis.
Most of the medical negligence cases are civil cases which should be proved on the balance of probability. The burden of proof befalls on the plaintiff, the patient. Unless proven otherwise the doctor is considered not negligent. In cases coming under res ipsa loquitur or the principle of facts speaking for themselves the doctor has to prove that he is not negligent. For example, in the amputation of the wrong limb, unless the doctor proves to the contrary, he is held negligent for that act. In criminal negligence, a fifth component comes to play a part. That is gross disrespect to human life. For example, if an on-call house officer does not attend to a surgical emergency despite repeated calls from the nurses and as a result, the patient dies of acute haemorrhage, this depicts the doctors disregard to human life.
There are few defenses a doctor can stick to in case of an allegation of medical negligence against him. One is the admittance of risk by the patient in the form of written informed consent. This is the legal principle of volunti non-fit injuria. Another approach is the denial of negligence.
The doctor also can claim that it is an inevitable accident or an act of God. Contributory negligence by the patient is another defense.
Vicarious liability and delegation of duties/responsibility is yet another approach. These are not discussed here in length.

Ananda Coomaraswamy
Amalgam of East and West
Ananda Kentish Coomarasamy was not an Indian by birth, but he showed more than any scholar, a wider understanding of Indias cultural heritage. He was born at Rhineland Place, Kollupitiya, on August 22, 1877, and was the only child of Sir Muthu Coomarasamy and his English mother Elizabeth Clay Beeby.
His father, Sir Muthu Coomarasamy, was well-versed in Western classics as well as Pali and Sanskrit. He translated Dhatavamsa (History of the Sacred Tooth Relic) from Pali into English, and was responsible for the establishment of the Colombo Museum in 1871. Sir Muttu Coomaraswamy was the first non-Christian form Asia to be called to the English Bar, and he was a prominent member of the Legislative Council in Ceylon.
During the reign of Queen Victoria, he was the first Asian to be knighted, and was a popular figure among the socialites in London. He enjoyed the company of Lord Palmerston, Lord Tennyson, and Benjamin Disraeli. He was portrayed by Disraeli as Kusinara in his unfinished novel.
When his son, Ananda, was almost two years old, Sir Muthu died. His mother brought him up in England where he received his education at Wycliff College in Stonehouse Gloucestershire, and later, at University College London.
In 1903, he was 25 years of age when he was appointed Director of the Mineralogical Surveys in Sri Lanka, and three years later, his contributions to the Mineralogy of Ceylon won him the degree of Doctor of Science of London University, of which he was elected a Fellow.
He was the Director of Mineralogical Surveys in Sri Lanka from 1903 to 1906, and that was the turning point of his career, when he made two discoveries, namely Serendibite in 1902 and Thorinite in 1904, at Gangapitiya in Gampola.
Writing on Serendibite, he said: It was of a beautiful blue colour, and was discovered in intimate association with the diopside in narrow contact zones between in acid moonstone bearing granulite and limestone, which occur in alternating bonds at Gangapitiya.
The second mineral he found was a cubic mineral of high specific gravity which analysis proved to be aside of Thorium and Uranium. The cubes were very small (2/10 inch.), and the colour was dark blue. The importance of this mineral was derived from its radioactive properties.
The travels he made around Kandy in search of minerals gave him the opportunity to visit villages known for traditional Kandyan arts and crafts. The age-old work practiced by the artisans threw much light on the different aspects of Sinhalese culture.
The information thus gathered enabled him to write his monumental treatise "Medieval Sinhalese Art," which he published in England in 1908. The publication of this book brought him recognition as a scholar. The success he achieved was due to his ability in delving into the source, and his insight, which gave him the authority to his interpretations that made his book unique.
The first edition of the book was limited to 425 copies printed under his supervision at the Essex House Press in the Norman Chapel at Broad Campden Gloucestershire. The publication of this book was considered a landmark by the scholars in the revival of Sri Lankas cultural heritage.
The studies he made revealed the cultural affinity between India and Sri Lanka, and he commented: a perfect window through which to gaze on Indias past than any that can be found in India itself.
According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, Sinhalese art is essentially Indian in outlook and Hindu in character. This aspect helped him assess culture in a truer perspective.
He said: "Every stem and leaf of the liyavela ornament in Ceylon, and in the details of South Indian architectural decoration is never realistic, but based on observations or ideal forms.
These carved forms or ornamentations were used by the Sinhalese craftsman to depict energy and growth, and Buddhist and Hindu concepts were depicted symbolically.
He found Kandyan art as a branch of Indian art, and the architecture of Kandy was similar to that of Kerala. The folk art of the Sinhalese, especially practiced by women, was related to motif ritual of the embroidered Kantha of Bengal. This affinity helped him to assess Indian culture in true form. He then abandoned his scientific research and devoted himself to the study of the arts and culture of India and Sri Lanka.
The result was his two monographs: The Aims of Indian Art and Bronzes from Ceylon. In these studies he attempted to reconstruct and interpret the philosophy of Hinduism. His research was not in the role of a romantic aesthetician, but as the foremost academic historian of Indian and Indonesian art. He succeeded in synthesizing the ideals and traditions of Indian art found in different parts of Asia and created a new consciousness of Indian cultural unity.
He wrote: The trained Sinhalese craftsman never falters because the carve is second nature to him. Such is the carve of energy and growthrhythmic and disciplined, but unsatisfied, ever-striving towards an end not yet attained as of a vine climber climbing upwards vigorously, or restless flames of fire.
The visits he made to India were fruitful. He studied art, music, dance, and religion. The worship of beauty was the motivation and message to his attitude towards Indian art.
In that sense, his role falls into three different types: First, as an exponent of the philosophical aspects and dramatic techniques of the Indian dance. Second, his influence on Hindu and Buddhist iconographic studies. Third, as an art critic whose artistic and scholarly interests ranged from the technical and theoretical aspects of Indian paintings to Tagores paintings.
His first essay, The Dance of Shiva, displayed aesthetic sensibility. It was his point of view and sense of the sublime. The aesthetic expression of a creative power could discover a mode expressive of fundamental rhythm and so profoundly significant and inevitable, as well as metaphysical focus of an image of reality. While Tagore pioneered the cultural experiment of the Manupuri dances in Shanthiniketan, Coomaraswamy explored the aesthetics of Bharata Natyam in Tanjavur. By doing so, he secured Bharata Natyam a place in the great tradition of the Indian dance.
The creative writings, History of Indian and Indonesian Painting and Rajput Painting were considered important for the study of art. He wanted to donate his collection of artifacts to the Indian government. Since it was not forthcoming, he left for the United States of America (USA) in 1915.
At first, he was appointed a Research Fellow at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. Later, he became the curator of Indian and Eastern Artthe post he held until his retirement a month prior to his death, on September 9, 1947, in Boston, at the age of 70 years.
He supported the Swadeshi Movement in India and argued against the import of cheap machine-made articles from the west, and he was also the champion of the national system of education. He advocated the Indian cultural and ethical values and an orderly and integrated life, joy, and beauty.
It was the time when western culture and Graecian concepts of beauty and aesthetics were considered highly that he espoused Indian art and thought it as the best in the world.
He was of the opinion that a single generation of English education succeeded in breaking the threads of tradition and created non-descript and superficial beings deprived of rootsa sort of intellectual pariahs belonging to neither the east nor west; past nor future.
Coomaraswamy further said, "our leaders are already degenerated quite as much as Macaulay could have wished them to bea class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, opinions, morals, and intellect because they have yet to discover India.
They have not realized that the modern world has no longer an integrated culture, but an organized barbarism and political pandemonium. He showed with his writings. how suicidal it was to live by bread alone and, he pointed out how disastrous it was to embark on a rudderless voyage under the illusion that it is progress.
"The measure of our culture," he said, "is not our ability to learn new tricks, but that of what we have to give. Therefore, he insisted on adherence to tradition."
As an accomplished linguist, he knew English, French, German, Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Pali, and Hindi. He also knew or acquainted himself with Italian, Spanish, Icelandic, Dutch, Persian, Tamil, and Sinhala.
The last book he wrote was "Why Exhibit Works of Art." He interpreted Indian thought forms. His interpretations inspired him to compile it. He collaborated with Sr. Nivedita to write Myths of Hindus and Buddhists. His earliest work, "Mirror of Gestures," was based on Indian dancing, which he jointly wrote with D. Gopalakrishnayya.
Writing on beauty, he said, It is a state. It is also widely held that the true criticRasikais able to decide which works of art are beautifulRasavantand which are not The concept of beauty, and the adjective, beautiful, belong exclusively to aesthetics, and should only be used in aesthetic judgement.
Ananda Coomaraswamy lived to see India usher in freedom, but soon had reason to deplore the imitation of western industrialism in free India.
His first wife, Ethel Mary, a German, helped him to write Medieval Sinhalese Art. The second wife, Alice, who was English, but called herself Ratna Devi, wrote a book on Indian songs.
Donna Luisa, his third wife, edited the books he had compiled before his death, and came to India with his ashes to fulfil his last wish.
Narada, his son, was a novelist who died in an airplane crash. His daughter, Rohini, a musician, lived in New York. The youngest son, Rama, a surgeon, worked in New York.
The interpretation of Indian wisdom to the west was inspired by his study of vedic thought.
With fame and recognition, he remained modest. He said, Anything personal must not intrude in my work. It would be Aswargya to allow such things
It is interesting to note that in 1905, he founded the Ceylon Social Reform Society to stress the grave threat to native social and cultural traditions from the indiscriminate copying of western models. He gave lectures and wrote articles to the Ceylon National Review of which he was the first editor.
He also urged the use of national languages in education and preservation of the arts and crafts and modes of drawing. He supported his cousin Arunachalam in the establishment of the Ceylon University.

Amarasiri Abeyewardene
Pioneer educationist
The current senior deputy principal of Stafford International School Amarasiri Abeyewardene will be completing 50 years in the field of education at the end of September, 2017, when he will be retiring from service at Stafford International School after 39 years. Abeyewardene, fondly known by his students as Mr. Abey, started his teaching career on October 1, 1967, when still at the University of Ceylon, Colombo.
He passed his Advanced Level from Royal College Colombo in 1965, and proceeded to do a science degree at the University of Ceylon, Colombo. At the General Science qualifying examination of 1966, he was one of nine students in a batch of 120 who passed the examination. As such, the first year general science BSc. batch was thus so small that eight other students from the Peradeniya Campus joined these nine students, so that the BSc. 1 batch had 17 students in total. This batch of students proceeded from BSc.1 to BSc. 2, and all of them qualified as BSc. graduates in October, 1968.
In 1968, he was appointed as a Chemistry demonstrator, but declined the appointment, as he had already found permanent employment. At the University, he was the treasurer and then the secretary of the student Christian movement. Together with students from the universities and schools, he participated in the Triennial Conference in Pune, India, where he was in-charge of a group.
He commenced his teaching career as the Physics lecturer at Pembroke Academy in Flower Road, Colombo 7. This academy was owned by his uncle Hope Abeyewardene, who was also a well-known educationist. He was a first-class physics teacher, who even had classes in his own house. The classes at Pembroke Academy consisted of more than 100 students, and Abeyewardene was able to get the attention of all whenever he took a class. He also taught chemistry and mathematics to the Advanced level first and second year students. As Pembroke was well-known for the success of failures of Advanced level students, who proceeded to universities, medical colleges and engineering faculties in the universities in Sri Lanka, many of his students have qualified as doctors, engineers, accountants and science graduates, who will vouch for his teaching and administrative abilities. Although he started as a teacher, he soon became the principal of the academya post he held from 1970 to December, 1978.
As Pembroke depended on its external students for practical examination, and as the department gave up the practical examinations, institutes like Pembroke could not survive and had to close down in December, 1978. In January, 1979, english medium students were transferred to Stafford, then known as Stafford Ladies College, and the sinhala medium students were relocated at Alexandra College, Colombo 8. Initially the English medium classes were held in the film co-orporation building adjacent to the Ladies College. In a couple of years, Stafford Ladies College was re-named Stafford Institute, then, Stafford Institute of higher education, and finally, Stafford International School.
The English medium students sat the local Advanced Level, and some of them, the London Advanced level, which was conducted by the London University. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the students had to go to India to sit for the examination. However, in the 1980s, the Department of Examinations conducted the examination for the London University. After some years, the conducting of the examination for the London University was handed over to the British Council, which up to now, conducts the examination initially for all candidates, but now, for the private candidates only. This is because some schools which conduct classes for the London examinations were awarded the status of Teaching Institutes, and these schools, such as Stafford International School, now conduct the examinations dealing directly with the examination bodies in U.K.
Abeywardena was appointed the Superintendent of examinations for Stafford International school for Edexcel, and then for Cambridge University, and deals directly with these two examination bodies. He has always been a tower of strength for Stafford as well as for his students at all times, and has conducted the examinations to the best of his ability and to the satisfaction of the examining bodies at all times.
Initially, when the English medium section commenced at Stafford, he was the head of this section. When the school became an International School, he assumed a dual role as the Vice Principal and physics teacher, then, the Deputy Principal, and now, the Senior Deputy Principala post he holds presently. Stafford International School changed from the Edexcel Curriculum to the Cambridge University O/L and A/L curricula, two years ago. The change was a blessing to its students as 20 world and country awards were received by students of Stafford, in 2016, which amounts to the highest number of awards received in a year by students of Stafford.
During his period of service at Stafford, he has been in charge of the school Interact Club for 25 years from its inception. He is also in charge of the School Aviation club. He has organised the school Carol Service for a number of years, seeing to every aspect of the service. With his guidance, the Interact Club has organised a number of Medical Camps in rural villages, specially in Kurunegala and Anuradhapura, and donated milk powder, dry rations, etc. to cancer patients, orphanages, and the poor, and has organized walks and fairs on three occasions.
He has written many recommendations for students, which the students will vouch for their admissions to foreign universities, and are extremely grateful to him. Even at his 40th wedding anniversary, the service there was a surprise when a past student, Malaka Talwatte, gave a glowing tribute to Mr. Abeywardena, saying that what he is today is due to his teaching and the recommendation he received for his entry to a UK University. The now famous eye surgeon Dr. Amila de Alwis and many other students also give similar tributes about Abeywardena. Even in church circles, he has held many positions. He has served in many committees, has been the Secretary of Finance of the Sri Lanka Methodist Church for 17 years, and has held the position of the Vice President of the Methodist Church Sri Lanka in 1996, which is the highest position which a layman could hold.
Abeywardena always loves and cares for the well-being of his students, and in turn, the students love him. This is simply displayed because whenever a past student working or studying abroad comes on a holiday to Sri Lanka, they make it a point to visit him at school or at his home to inquire about him, his family, other teachers, and the school. The saying goes all good things must come to an end, I am sure the management, teachers, and students of Stafford will miss the services of Abeywardena when he relinquishes his services to the school at the end of September, 2017. Be it Amarasiris Vice Presidency in the Methodist Church in 1995, their Silver Wedding in 1994, their Ruby Wedding in 2009, the one who was most excited was his wife Caryl, who died suddenly on February 10, 2017. She was always looking forward to their Golden Wedding in 2019, which is now only a dream for Amarasiri. Their two children, Arindra, who is married and in Australia, and Cheryl, who stays with Amarasiri, with her child, Malik, because her husband works in Hong Kong, now see to the needs of their father. Caryl was always a tower of strength in all the activities her husband was involved in.

The 90th anniversary of the Sinhalese Dictionary falls on March 21. A dictionary for a span of nine decades is indeed a landmark in Sinhalese literature. The 90th anniversary commemoration of the Sinhala Dictionary would be held today at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute Auditorium with President Mithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe gracing this momentous occasion. This article endeavours to examine these nine decades in retrospect.
It was the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society (RAS, CB) in Colombo who mooted the idea of a scientific Dictionary of the Sinhalese Language and it was through this society that plan was launched which was eventually to be realized.
The initial impetus came from Dr. Reinhold Rost (1822-1896) a native of Eisenberg from Central Germany who was bestowed a doctoral degree for a thesis based on the Sinhalese language which was awarded by the University of Jena, who was later appointed as the Head Librarian of the India Office Library in 1869. Rost was known an acclaimed profound authority as Edward Mueller his Simplified Grammar of the Pali Language in 1884 and R. C. Childers, his Dictionary of Pali Language were dedicated to him.
Rost wrote to another Pali Scholar Sir John F. Dickson then the President of the RAS, CB laying emphasis on the need of a Sinhalese Dictionary on Scientific lines. The society at the general meeting held on October 4, 1888 set up a committee comprising of Waskaduwe Subuthi Thera, Mudliyar B. Gunasekera, W. P. Ranasinha and R. S. Copleston Bishop of Colombo, an author of a work on Buddhism. Though few texts were indexed a specimen vocabulary were compiled but the time was not ripe to reach fruition for such an endeavour.
In 1925 Sir Cecil Clementi as the President of the RAS, CB revived the original plan. The valedictory presidential address at the general meeting of the October 1925 categorically indicates that the aims of the dictionary were twofold. Thus: A better understanding of the language and building up of a really fine modern Sinhalese literature.
Prof. Wilhelm Geigers second visit to Ceylon his arrival was expected by this time. Sir Cecil thought that this would offer a gateway of opportunity through Geigers expertise. Thus: He hoped that Professor Geiger would not be allowed to go away without giving the society its views as to the lines upon which the dictionary could be best prepared.
Julius de Lanerolle who was later assigned the task of completing the Dictionary observes its progress in 1945 Centenary Volume of RAS, CB on the Geigers outset dealings. Thus: Professor Geiger was eventually consulted. After a careful study of the Societys proposals he submitted a Report, dated February 3,1926, setting forth in brief outline not only what organisation there should be but also what form the dictionary itself should take. His recommendations were sound and generally acceptable to all schools of modern scholarship. They were adopted in toto when the Dictionary came to be finally designed, though they seem to have escaped the attention of those who were responsible for some specimen entries which were at one stage submitted to a Committee of European scholars before editorial treatment was started.
The then Government of Ceylon on an invitation extended for Geiger to stay in Ceylon and edit the Dictionary. Geiger requested time to re-think and wrote from Java on May 26, 1926 declining the said request. The reply of the Colonial Secretary in Colombo dated July 8, 1926 sets out the intention of re-approaching Geiger at a later date. Thus:
Dear Professor Geiger,
I have received your letter of the 26th May in which you say that you have definitely come to the conclusion that if would not be possible for you to undertake the Editorship of the proposed Sinhalese Dictionary. The Government has received this intimation with much regret, though it was not unexpected, and it highly appreciates your offer of assistance in the future, of which it will not fail to take advantage should occasion arise.
The RAS, CB on March 26, 1926 in accordance with Geigers recommendations took steps to set up a Committee of the Dictionary with H. W. Codrington, W. Geiger, D. B. Jayatileke and Abraham Mendis Gunasekera as members.
Authority on Sinhalese grammar
The work took eager earnestness with the Ceylon Government assuring its solemn support. But the project invariably suffered considerable delay and difficulties. The 17th International Congress of Orientalist held in Oxford in 1928 appointed another advisory panel, a Consultative Committee for the Dictionary. The following year a preliminary specimen of six pages were prepared and circulated throughout the world by the Dictionary Office.
Julius de Lanerolle in his article entitled: Sinhalese Dictionary and the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in Journal of RAS CB. (NS) Vol I P14 says that totally ignored Geigers recommendations and this specimen was useful in methodical basis on which to find a scientific dictionary. The Dictionary office of Colombo was fraught with difficulties as there was no co-operation in between the English members of the 1928 consultative committee, the rival London Committee.
The official report of 1931 has expressed ray of optimism on the progress of the Dictionary. It is said that a more authentic account could be found in a letter written by Prof. Gunapala P. Malalasekera (1899-1973) Pali Scholar to Geiger on February 11, 1931. Malalasekera asserted on the problems lay before them. He indicated that although Sir D. B. Jayatilekes Wide knowledge of Slinhalese was acknowledged by all but his arduous political duties were a harbinger and also of his meagre knowledge on Pali and Sanskrit philology.
Though Mudliyar W. F. Gunawardana was known as an authority on Sinhalese grammar as a philologist he was known to be obsessed with unfounded theories of the Dravidian origins of the Sinhalese. Therefore his etymology was considered unduly biased. Though Mudliyar Abraham Mendis Gunasekera was considered as the most skilled lexicographer at the time was at his ripe age his sudden death on February 10, 1931 brought a setback to this project.
G. P. Malalasekera observes the unsatisfactory state of affairs that prevailed. Thus:
The work was done largely by monks and school teachers in various parts of the island who had no idea whatsoever of lexicography. The result is a very large collection of words true enough, but of title use for lexicographical purposes.
It seems to me that all the words will have to be referred to their context again by someone competent, but even that will not be easy as in a good many cases the manuscripts which were indexed are not in the possession of the Dictionary Committee, nor have they got copies. There is nobody in the Dictionary who knows any French or German and the whole mass of philological literature available is to them, therefore, a closed book.
The state of affairs of the Dictionary was indeed in a sad plight thus because of the complications that arose from the expert opinions.
There were clear difference in opinion of British Indologists who got involved in criticizing the specimen entries without any constructive criticism to improve same; the others who wished to expand the project oriented towards the etymology of the other modern Indo Aryan languages.
Sir Baron Jayatileke took the initiative to clear up this situation by extending the invitation to Wilhelm Geiger to take over the editorial work to formulate and launch further plans to continue further compilation of the Sinhalese Dictionary. Hence D. B. Jayatilekes functions remained primarily as the figure head.
On December 18, 1931 Magdalene and Wilhelm Geiger arrived Colombo for their final visit to Ceylon. Geiger in his memoirs Aus Meinem Leben Vol 2 pp 145-6 provides that Baron Jayatileke did not hesitate to confess the personal and administrative problems that beset him in progressing the Dictionary then he could workout a better plan accordingly. Geiger had two colleagues working closely for him. The first was Julius de Lanerolle where Sir Baron he himself had a high opinion for his ability and perseverance. The other was M. D. Ratnasuriya.
Thus Prof. Geiger in his memoir observes the difficulties that he encountered: When one considers that there was no lack of intrigue against Jayatilaka, against the entire idea of the Dictionary, and probably against me personally, and that there were not altogether unfounded complaints as to the squandering of financial resources, one can realize that our editorial life was not exactly a bed of roses. Add to all this the fatigue of daily office-work.
We would leave for the Office at about 9.00 a.m. and work really hard, without a break, until 1.00 p.m. Then we would return to the hotel for lunch, and go back to work at 3.00 p.m., when we put in another hour or two, often literally in the sweat of our brows. In a tropical climate, at the age of seventy-five, such intensive work comes as a real strain.
Sinhalese Language and Literature
The official report of the RAS, CB Council Meeting minutes for RAS dated May 14, 1932 observes a similar position:
Dr. and Mrs. Geiger worked continuously at the Dictionary from the time they arrived in Ceylon until they left.
Geiger assiduously worked together with his wife Magdalene, sorted out 600,000 entry slips systematically arranged in filing cabinets with a fervent intention once the fresh entries emerged to revise them. Geigers meticulous painstaking work paved the way for the future methodical work on Dictionary.
The first fascicle of the Dictionary of the Sinhalese Language emerged in 1935 and according to the title page states that was compiled under the direction of Wilhelm Geiger by four scholars: Sir D. B. Jayatileka as the Editor in Chief, the late Vasala Mudliyar A. M. Gunasekera, Vasala Mudliyar W. F. Gunawardhane who opted to resign in 1932 and Julius de Lanerolle.
It was de Lanerolle who shouldered the burden to toil and moil of the editorial work in Colombo. The first fascicle of the Dictionary contains a detailed introduction on Sinhalese Language and Literature. Geiger has sent same to Sir D. B. Jayatileke on December 1, 1931 and both were signatories of same.
Geiger advocated that Helmer Smith (1882-1956) to be his successor. Geiger also wished de Lanerolle to have further study at Neubiberg which was realized only in 1936.
Helmer Smiths name appeared with Geiger on the title-page in fascicle (part 2) 1936 of the Sinhalese Dictionary.
The Dictionary achieved great esteem throughout the scientific world by March 1935, with over 1,100 subscribers enlisted which ran into 22 parts by 1991 covering all vowels. In 1992 it was possible to complete the Sinhala-Sinhala etymological Dictionary in 26 volumes and 46 parts. Thereafter 6 revised volumes emerged. In 1941 the responsibility for the Dictionary from the RAS CB, passed to the University of Ceylon in 1942 and now it was re-transferred in 1972 to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. A Dictionary Office was setup by this Ministry who is mindful of the countries heritage.
It was in this spirit that the RAS, CB sphere headed and embarked upon a task to start Sinhalese Dictionary where the University of Ceylon and Ministry of Cultural Affairs has continued it for posterity as a national heritage. No doubt the Sinhala Dictionary has continued to maintain high standards of scholarship as the only such organisation in South-East Asia.

## Title: A UNPers lament

A UNPers lament
Kurunegala District UNP parliamentarian Indunil Thushara is a much aggrieved man. He laments that although he had striven hard for the victory of President Maithripala Sirisena he had been overlooked for Ministerial office. He said three individuals from Kurunegala who worked against President Sirisena's victory were today Ministers. He also said that people were wondering why the government had so far not nabbed any rogues.
The MP is not alone in his predicament. Many UNP parliamentarians, some of whom even risked their lives working for the President, at the last Presidential election, have the same grievance. They are justified to a great extent. Having been in the Opposition for the last two decades they would naturally like to savour the fruits of office. To add insult to injury, some UNP MPs have even been forced to serve as deputy ministers or state ministers under SLFP ministers who themselves worked against the President. One such minister who insulted the President at a personal level during the election campaign is today an important minister while another who vilified former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in a most degrading manner too is a minister. On the other hand the UNP MPs who braved all odds to enthrone the Common Candidate are forced to take a backseat in the government.
However galling as it may be, the UNP MPs who sacrificed a lot, but received little or nothing for their trouble, should learn to grin and bear and accept the consequences of a Unity Government. They should also bear in mind that the move was the brainchild of their own leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The UNP won the general election by a razor thin majority and there was the very real possibility of Mahinda Rajapaksa buying over some MPs from the minority parties to form a government of his own and stake the claim for the Premiership. In such an eventuality all would have been lost to those MPs who are now harbouring grievances. Besides, the constitutionally prescribed numerical limit for ministers has already been reached and there is no way that the President could add to the exiting numbers. This is one of the reasons that has even stalled some of the Joint Opposition MPs from crossing over to the government. There is also the question of a bloated Cabinet.
Be that as it may, the disgruntled UNP MPs should take to heart from the fact that they have a government led by their party after over two decades and make a meaningful contribution towards taking the country forward. Besides, a government jointly formed by the once arch foes is a good thing that has happened to the country, putting paid to the contentious and vituperative politics we have been witnessing right all along. Since Independence the trend had always been for the victor at an election to call a halt to the projects and proposals of the departing regime and commence their own thing, with the vicious cycle continuing, stifling development and progress. Now for the first time both major parties are working together in unison, which indeed is a refreshing experience and redounds to the good of the country. With both parties agreeing to extend their cooperation for the duration of the present government one can hope for positive developments, unlike before, when rancorous politics retarded progress.
Of course there are certain SLFP MPs who are trying to rock the boat and make statements and remarks that could cause damage to this unity. Such elements should be reined in by the President, if the present arrangement is to proceed unhindered. This is also sometimes seized upon by members of the Joint Opposition to make the public believe that cracks are emerging within the Unity Government. True, there could naturally be differences, when, once arch rivals happen to work together, as in the present instance. Besides, the policies and ideology of the UNP and SLFP differ, although it must be stated that the gulf in the economic policies of the two parties have narrowed considerably, thanks to the course correction made by CBK when she was President. However these factors should not be allowed to stand in the way of unity.
Be that as it may, the President should appreciate the contribution made by the UNP towards his victory, when a majority of the SLFPers now in government were solidly behind Mahinda Rajapaksa. Hence any move to sideline UNP MPs would not only seem ungracious but will have other consequences. A disgruntled set of MPs in the government is bound to affect its forward march. Many are the times recently when groups of UNP MPs were seen summoning press conferences to voice their grievances over the utterances of certain SLFP MPs which no doubt would have been sweet music to the members of the JO. MP Thushara's lamentation is a reflection of this frustration being harboured by a section of the UNP MPs. It would be wise for both the President and Prime Minister to discuss matters with these UNP backbenchers and alley their concerns, without letting things to fester within and cause disharmony in the Unity Government.

Vaiko arrested while attempting to besiege Lankan embassy
MDMK General Secretary Vaiko and his followers along with traders union leader T. Vellaiyan were arrested on Saturday when they attempted to besiege the Deputy High Commission of Sri Lanka opposing a resolution in the UN Human Rights Council seeking more time for Sri Lanka to probe the war crimes during the military offensive in 2009. Addressing the protesters, Vaiko said the United States would bring a resolution giving two more years for Sri Lanka to hold an inquiry into the war crimes and the resolution also says that no international jurists could enter Sri Lanka without the latters consent.
The new resolution will bury justice for Tamils at the United Nations since a resolution asking Lanka to carry out an international, independent investigation was passed in the UNHRC in 2015, Vaiko said.

We did too many mistakes  Herath
A maiden Test defeat at the hands of Bangladesh was not the result Sri Lankas acting captain Rangana Herath would have scripted at the commencement of the second Test at the P Sara Oval. But it so happened, that Herath on his 39th birthday suffered his first loss as Sri Lanka captain in four Tests.
I thought we did too many mistakes while fielding and batting. We dropped a couple of crucial catches and that was the main reason for us to lose the match, said Herath at the post-match press conference.
Bangladesh won the second Test by four wickets to draw the two-match series one-all.
If you take the second innings we were batting well. After Upul (Tharanga) got out, Dimuth (Karunaratne) and Kusal Mendis were going great and then we lost five wickets for 40 runs. That was the key. That turned the game. That shouldnt have happened. That started our collapse, said Herath.
Before the series started I said that this was going to be a challenging one as both teams were equally balanced. We had a good chance in Galle as we got close to 500 runs. Here we couldnt do the same. The team that played well won the game today.
On the progress made by Bangladesh as a Test nation, Herath said, They have certainly improved a lot. Earlier when they got partnerships going, they didnt take pressure well. Now they counter our plans and they have been very clever.
I thought that we could defend the target of 191. We have played games with India and Pakistan and defended low scores. So having three spinners I was confident that we could pull it off. We got two early wickets but after lunch they were attacking and the game slipped away from us.
Sri Lanka cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha admitted that Sri Lanka had not fielded well in the series.
I dont think we are one of the worst fielding sides. We dropped a few catches which is bad, said Gurusinha.
Working on little things is important. I am observing what we are doing well and what we are not doing well. Fielding will be one area we will focus a lot before the one-day games with coach Graham Ford. Its skill and a lot of repetition.
Its not the amount of time you do Its the quality of training do. We need to improve the intensity and not the time. You can do one hour or half hour. Its the intensity we have to concentrate on. We will increase our intensity levels in training.
Bangladeshs winning captain Mushfiqur Rahim owed his teams success to how much each member valued the match.
What made me happy was how we understood the value of the match even when we were ahead of behind in the game, said Mushfiqur. We tried to understand the value of a run, a misfield. Giving away runs in the first innings may not seem much at the time, but it comes back to hurt you at the end of the day.
We tried to recognize these small things. The fact that we realised each and every bit of it was quite impressive. The batsmen and bowlers played with responsibility, which made it a happy moment for us, he said.
It is new for us to chase in this type of wicket on a fifth day. We needed a 50-plus opening stand, but Tamim and Sabbir really made it easy for us with their 100-plus stand. But no opposition would let us have it easy. We had the belief in the end stages, though unfortunately, we lost Shakib. We had Mosaddek and Mirza, and we thought we could do it in singles. - ST

WHY THIS PRIVATE PHOBIA
This is a continuation of my previous correspondence on the SAITM issue, which I published in the Daily News of July 15, 2016. In this article, I hope to convince the public of the glaring need for private Medical Colleges in this country to be worked out on a public-private partnership in this country.
This is the only country in the world that is against private medical colleges. I was the Professor at the first North Colombo Medical College, which was established 1981 by the College of General Practitioners, and continued till 1995, when it was taken over by the government and made into the Kelaniya Medical Faculty. Although the CGP built a beautiful three-storied building to house the professorial units, and built many buildings to house the pre-clinical and para-clinical departments and a large library, no compensation was given to the CGP by the government.
This is one of the 16 countries in the world that has free education from Grade one up to University. It is the taxpayers of this country who have to pay for free Education. Unfortunately, what is given free is never appreciated, and that is why we see so many strikes by the IUSF and protest marches in the country, as they dont have to pay for their Education.
Throughout the world, universities admit purely on merit. In our time, we had to go for an interview before we were selected for the university. In our country, admission to the university is no more done on merit, but by a peculiar system known as Z Score, by which even the best students with 3 As dont get admission to the Medical Faculties, and the parents have to send their children abroad to various medical colleges and universities approved by the SLMC. It is a well-known fact that many of the Doctors serving in the private and public sector, and universities have been sending their children abroad over many years, for higher qualifications in Medicine and various other fields. Many of them never return to Sri Lanka. Thus, according to Minister Kiriella, over Rs. 15 billion has been lost to the country every year due to the fact that we have no facilities in this country for private medical education.
Fortunately, IUSF doesnt seem to make a fuss about the vast number of international schools in the country, and the private universities and establishments that are continuing to give degrees in various other fields such as Accountancy, Engineering, Law, IT etc. None of these professionals go on strikes or protest marches in this country like medicos.
There are about 26,000 doctors registered with the SLMC; about 20,000 in government service, and 15,000  16,000 of Government Doctors are members of the GMOA. The eight state medical faculties in Sri Lanka have an out put 1,200 doctors per year. And about another 300 Doctors who are Sri Lankan citizens qualified overseas enter the work force every year. So in all only around 1,500 doctors enter the work force every year.
Sri Lanka has a population of 21 million, and this goes up every year by over 300,000. The proportion of doctors to the population is around 1:1,000. In Britain, it is 1:20. So will we never be able to reach those figures even after couple of centuries at the rate we are going. The government is hoping to open up two faculties in Wayamba & Sabaragamuwa. Every year we will require 300 more doctors for the increase of population annually.
The specialist medical officers in curative (hospital) services 2016 is as follows:
Total cadre required: 3,078
Total in position: 1,634
Total vacancies: 1,447
How long will these vacancies take to be filled The cadre will increase every year with the increase in population.
The WHO requests the government to reduce the doctor to patient ratio to 500. This means that we will require 40,000 doctors for a population of 20 million. Can the medical faculties in the country ever produce this number even for another 100 years Thus, it is quite obvious to any sane person to realize that we require private medical institutions under the PPP Programme urgently in this country. We require at least 20 more faculties to produce this number. I cannot understand how intelligent Doctors in the GMOA cannot realize this. They too, are carrying on protest marches and strikes in various parts of the country, putting the poor patients in to so much inconvenience and trouble. In my opinion, all this is done with selfish motives. However, they do their private practice in the evening, attending to the rich.
In our times, 40  50 years ago, medical professions were highly respected. However, I feel ashamed when I hear of what it has come to. It is no longer a profession or vocation, but downright business. In the NCMC, we taught our students not only medicine, but to treat the patients with TLC(Tender, loving care). Unfortunately, I dont think that this is ever taught in our state medical faculties. That is why the graduates who passed out from the NCMC are top consultants in this country and even abroad, because their approach to patients is quite different.
The GMOA and the medical students are protesting against the ruling given by the Court of Appeal. In my opinion, they should be charged for contempt of court. The SLMC has appealed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. We will have to wait and see what the outcome is.

Women entrepreneurs  empowered by Coca-Cola
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka organised an internal event for its executive staff on March 8.
Leading women entrepreneurs in Coca-Colas 5by20 network converged on the venue from diverse regions such as Negombo, Hambantota, Vavuniya and Kandy, to share their success stories.
The international theme Be Bold for Change was very evident during this session, as the women recounted their personal struggles and how they took a bold step towards entrepreneurship for the well-being and future security of their loved ones.
The women entrepreneurs shared their experiences in overcoming economic crisis, physical disabilities and society pressures and norms, to become successful entrepreneurs, only because of the support and guidance they received from Coca-Colas 5by20 programme.
The 5by20 programme is conducted locally in partnership with Women in Management (WIM) in the form of Business Skills Development training programmes, which are customised to suit the training needs of different women.
The inspirational storytelling session was followed by the women entrepreneurs showcasing their products ranging from handmade, leather and cloth shoes and bags, organic jams and pickles, kurakkan based products and batik and wax creations.
Both male and female executives had the opportunity to engage one-on-one with the women entrepreneurs, and purchase their goods in support of their incredible journeys, their resourcefulness and creativity.
Commenting on the 5by20 experience, Nisha from Kandy said, To be bold, what I believe is that every woman should have both discipline and strength. This strength will help us face obstacles and overcome any problem in life. The 5by20 initiative has given me the confidence to achieve my target.
Coca-Cola, International Womens Day 2017 was a week-long celebration with activities where both men and women could actively join hands in creating a more inclusive work environment, conducive to their needs and creating a culture that empowers women.

World Water Day : Sustaining the liquid of life!
Wednesday will be United Nations' World Water Day. The event is held on March 22 each year. Events are organized on or around this day to increase people's awareness of water's importance in environment, agriculture, health and trade. Its aim is to remind people about the significance of fresh water and to promote sustainability for fresh water resources' management.
Its a day to celebrate water. Its a day to prepare for how we manage water in the future. Each year World Water Day highlights a specific aspect of freshwater. Last years theme was: Water and jobs. Better water, better jobs. Today, almost half of the world's workers - 1.5 billion people - work in water-related sectors and nearly all jobs depend on water and those that ensure its safe delivery.
World Water Day celebrations in 2017 will highlight the theme Waste Water. Climate change, population growth and economic development demand for sustainable solutions to make the world future-proof. Waste water is perceived as a valuable resource in the circular economy and its safe management is an efficient investment in the health of humans and ecosystems. Improving waste water management means improvement on all six targets of the Sustainable Development Goal on Water. Remember there is no such thing as wastewater - only water wasted.
Toda Today, almost half of the world's workers - 1.5 billion people depend on water and those that ensure its safe delivery. Yet the millions of people who work in water are often not recognized or protected by basic labour rights. The theme in 2016  water and jobs  is focusing on nd livelihoods - and even transform societies and economies.
Gaston de Rosayro
Water! We drink it, wash in it, cook with it, swim in it and generally take it for granted. This clear, tasteless and odourless liquid is so much part of our lives that we hardly ever think about its amazing properties but take hardly give it a second thought unless we are denied access to it. We would die in a few days without water as 65 percent of our bodies are composed of water.
Besides slaking our thirst, water is necessary to dissolve essential minerals and oxygen, flush our bodies of waste products, and transport nutrients around the body where needed. Water is the only substance that has these properties. And it has many more fascinating features that suggest that it has been designed just right for life.
The availability of water
Water is not only the most essential substance next to oxygen for human life. It is also complex, often containing hundreds of dissolved minerals and chemicals. Most water is also structured or clustered in complex ways. It is indeed a remarkable substance whose extreme value is often unrecognised. And today, we are messing with it. The sheer number of human beings on Earth - seven billion, with another two billion likely by 2050 - is adding unsustainable stress to the supply and the quality of fresh water all over the globe. While water is life, the limited, and in too many cases, nonexistent, availability of clean, potable water means lingering sickness and even death for countless people in scores of countries.
Water, water everywhere, not a clean drop to drink! The old primer attributed to a ship-wrecked victim may become a terrifying reality if our precious liquid is not managed and sustained adequately. Who would have thought that there will be a day when sanitation of available water would be more of a concern than availability of water itself 
The availability of water decides not only the number of individuals of each species that are able to survive in a particular area, but it also decides the diversity of life there. Of course, the availability of water is not the only aspect that decides the sustainability of life in a region. Other factors such as the temperature and nature of soil also matter. But water is one of the major resources which determine life on land.
A healthy planet
Many of us in Sri Lanka do not realise how fortunate we are. We simply turn on a tap when we need fresh clean water. We use this water for a variety of purposes. On average, our direct indoor water use comes to over 69 gallons of water per person per day. When you include all uses of water at home, both indoor and outdoor, a local family of four can use up to 400 gallons per day!
But spare a thought for the nearly 750 million people around the world who still have no access to clean drinking water. That is why so many people, children in particular, suffer all types of life threatening illnesses. In many parts of the undeveloped world, including Sri Lanka, women waste hours walking to fetch water from streams and waterholes rather than spending their time more productively.
It behoves us all to tell the world that responsible use of fresh water is essential for a healthy planet and human well-being. But fresh water, in turn, isnt possible without a healthy planet. Yet human actions are putting a healthy planet at risk. After all, life on earth is maintained by water. A crisis of fresh water will be the biggest challenge to humans in the millennium.
Saving water
That is why all the worlds national authorities responsible for drinking water supplies keep stressing the importance of spreading the message that drinking water will be the most precious commodity in the world in the near future. Water means different things to each of us but one thing is for sure! It is vital for all our lives.
This is a problem that concerns us all. Water authorities everywhere are striving frantically to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene to cover the worlds population by 2030. The goal is possible only if we all chip in and help them.
Fortunately, saving water around the house is easier today than ever before. Modern toilets, showers and faucets are designed to be more efficient and can save your household many gallons per day. For example, older toilets can use up to 6 gallons per flush, whereas newer low-flow (water-saving) toilets use from 1.6 to 3.5 gallons, and high-efficiency models even less. Similarly, regular showerheads spray nearly a gallon per minute, while low-flow models put out just over half a gallon per minute. That is why we should also consider cutting our shower time down by at least a few minutes.
No matter how you spell it or how you pronounce it, H2O is a wonder: a beautifully simple, simply beautiful element that, when all is said and done, means nothing less than life.

Xi, Tillerson vow to work toward closer US-China ties
CHINA: Chinese President Xi Jinping and US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pledged in talks on Sunday that the two powers would work to strengthen a relationship that has been unsettled by disputes over North Korea and trade.
Xi met Tillerson in Beijing just hours after nuclear-armed North Korea tested US-China unity anew with a provocative rocket engine test, and with negotiations under way for a potential Xi summit next month with President Donald Trump in the United States.
Xi said told Tillerson that he and Trump had resolved in a phone call last month to make joint efforts to advance China-US cooperation, and we believe that we can make sure the relationship will move ahead in a constructive fashion in the new era.
Im confident that as long as we can do this the relationship can surely move in the right direction, Xi said.
En route to Beijing, Tillerson visited US allies Japan and South Korea where he declared Washington would drop the failed approach of strategic patience diplomacy with Pyongyang -- a sharp break with China, which favours careful diplomacy over heated rhetoric.
Relations have also been strained by Chinas fierce opposition to a US anti-missile defence system being deployed in South Korea, and Trumps Twitter accusation on Friday that China was not doing enough to control its neighbour and historic ally Pyongyang.
Trump also has repeatedly accused China of unfair trade practice.
But Tillerson has made nice while in Beijing.
We know that through further dialogue we will achieve a greater understanding that will lead to a ... strengthening of the ties between China and the United States and set the tone for our future relationship of cooperation, Tillerson told Xi.
Earlier Sunday, North Korean state media said the isolated regime had tested a powerful engine hailed by leader Kim Jong-Un as a new birth for its rocket industry, which experts view as cover for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles.
The announcements timing appeared intended to sour the visit to China by Tillerson, who warned on Saturday after talks with his counterpart Wang Yi tensions on the Korean Peninsula had reached a dangerous level. Tillerson and Wang pledged China and the United States would work together toward denuclearising Kims rogue regime, but did not offer clear details on how.
It was not immediately clear whether Xi and Tillerson discussed North Koreas latest thumb in the eye.
The Norths state news agency KCNA said Kim had overseen the rocket engine test and emphasised that the whole world will soon witness what eventful significance the great victory won today carries -- a possible veiled warning to Pyongyangs adversaries.
The report hinted the new engine could be used to put a satellite in orbit, but rocket engines are easily re-purposed for missiles.
North Korea is banned by the international community from pursuing nuclear and missile programmes but has defiantly ploughed ahead.
It staged its two latest nuclear tests last year and recently fired off missiles that it described as practice for an attack on US bases in Japan.
The leader (Kim) noted that the success made in the current test marked a great event of historic significance as it declared a new birth, of North Koreas rocket industry, KCNA said.
The Xi-Tillerson meeting came as delicate negotiations are under way for a Xi-Trump summit, possibly next month in the United States.
Trump has been a frequent China critic, and the summit could be crucial in setting a lasting tone in the relationship between the worlds two largest economies.- AFP

Sri Lanka ranks top in health indicators
Sri Lanka enjoys impressive health indicators with a life expectancy for males and females standing at 72 years and 80 years respectively, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
As per WHO Global Report 2016, the incidence of tuberculosis in Sri Lanka is estimated at 65 per 100,000 population while prevalence and mortality stood at 99 and 5.6 per 100,000 population, the Minister said.
The Pulmonary TB notifications, which showed an increase till 2011, has remained steady since then at little over 10,000 detections annually. Of all the cases reported, nearly 45 percent cases were from the Western Province, Minister Rajitha said.
The Minister was addressing the Ministerial Meeting Towards Ending TB in the South-East Asian Region in New Delhi, India recently.
The Minister said according to WHO statistics, deaths due to chronic pulmonary airways diseases reached 6,127 or 4.84 percent of all deaths in 2014, while the age adjusted Death Rate stood at 29.4 per 100,000 of population, ranking at 38 in the global index.
This is in spite of the fact that Sri Lanka is ranked 11th out of 34 Asian countries surveyed by the 2015 mid-year `Numbeo Pollution Index, which estimates overall pollution, with the biggest weight given to air pollution.
Nearly 70 percent of the hospital deaths in Sri Lanka are due to major non communicable diseases such as cardio-vascular diseases, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases.
The probability of dying prematurely from NCDs is 18 percent. Government target is to reduce this by two percent annually, the Minister said.

The Sri Lankan crew rescued from Somali pirates on Friday is yet to decide whether they would continue to work on the ship or return home.
Namalie Sampath, sister of the chief officer on board Ruwan Sampath said; since they were able to drop off their cargo of oil at Djibouti, my brother said that they are yet to decide on whether they would come home or not, she said.My brother spoke to me today (19) and said that he was fine with working but given the emotional strain of last week, it would depend on whether the rest of the crew too is up to continuing with working. They would also have to wait for another crew to take over before they can be released from the ship, she added.
The Aris 13 was escorted on Friday by a French warship and Somalian marine forces to Bossaso in Somalia.
The Somali pirates hijacked the vessel on March 13. After four days of intense diplomatic negotiations and foreign military assistance, the vessel was released without a ransom being paid.

## Title: Back when pop music was literary
## Supertitle:

Back when pop music was literary
As a commentary on Jacobean tragedy, Echo and the Bunnymens 1983 track, The White Devil, is of limited use. It doesnt tell us much that is original or penetrating about its subject, the playwright John Webster:
John Webster was / One of the best there was / He was the author of / Two major tragedies / The White Devil and / The Duchess of Malfi / The White Devil and / The Duchess of Malfi
As a reflection of the state of pop in the early 1980s, though, the song has more value. Never mind how prosaic are the words of singer and songwriter Ian McCullough; what is significant is that Echo and the Bunnymen, no strangers to the upper end of the singles charts, regular visitors to Top of the Pops, saw fit to write about a seventeenth-century dramatist (other than, of course, the most famous one). In this  turning to literature for raw material  the band were far from alone among their contemporaries.
Released the same year as The White Devil was Spandau Ballets True. Take your seaside arms and write the next line, declares Tony Hadley, a touch obscurely, at one of the songs many moments of unbearable emotional drama (unbearable for the singer, and perhaps the listener too). That peculiar line, the songwriter Gary Kemp has since clarified, was a reference to a passage in Lolita where Humbert Humbert is haunted by the memory of a little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue. True might have had the distinction of being the first UK Number One single to reference Vladimir Nabokov, had it not been for The Polices Dont Stand So Close to Me three years earlier. There, Sting had evoked the relationship between a teacher and a schoolgirl with an allusion to the same book that would later inspire Kemp:
Its no use, he sees her / He starts to shake and cough / Just like the old man in / That book by Nabokov
The year after True, Duran Duran, whom the music press liked to portray as Spandau Ballets sworn rivals, had a hit with The Wild Boys. If Spandau Ballet had smuggled a liking for scandalous reading matter into True, Duran Duran exceeded them by basing a song on a novel from 1971 by William S. Burroughs. The Wild Boys: A book of the dead is Burroughss fantasy of a band of adolescent males crossing a ruined North America in a riot of fighting and homosexual sex. Simon le Bons lyrics dont appear to mention the second of those activities  the teenage girls who made up the largest part of Duran Durans audience might have been put off (or, perhaps, made over-excited)  but a literary source had once again found its way on to mainstream radio.
Just as much as synthesizers, hairspray and record sleeves in the Russian abstract style, a major marker of the pop of the early 1980s and late 1970s, particularly British pop, was bookishness. If literary influences werent always worked subtly, or even meaningfully, into the lyrics of the era, they at least indicated an intellectual curiosity and ambition on the part of their authors, not many of whom, it is worth noting, were university graduates.
This habit of advertising in song the contents of ones bookshelves suggested, too, that being widely read might even have a distinct glamour about it. To anyone studying the downloads charts today  where you will search in vain for echoes of the English Renaissance stage or the Penguin Classics backlist  this idea will probably seem quite bizarre. One of those non-graduates with an impressive personal library was Ian Curtis, the singer and lyricist for Joy Division. Several years before Duran Duran took William S. Burroughs into the charts, the novelist had supplied Curtis with a well of potently diseased imagery, and perhaps a degree of highbrow ballast too.
Interzone, from Joy Divisions 1979 album Unknown Pleasures, borrows its title from the hellish country in which much of Naked Lunch occurs.
The song, which takes us on a walk through the city limits in the company of an existentially damaged narrator, is not as vivid on the page as Burroughss prose. Yet, listening as Curtiss stark words drone on, drawing you into the songs terminal space, you are witness to a songwriter introducing pop to regions where only difficult literature had gone before. Other Joy Division song titles  Dead Souls, Atrocity Exhibition  further show the bands interest in making records that blur into the reading lists.
At the same time that Curtis was inventing a Gogolian and Ballardian music, in the same city of Manchester, the singer Morrissey was taking care of his own education, having left school at sixteen.
Oh, theres more to life than books, you know, he sang on the Smiths 1983 track Handsome Devil, but not much more. Throughout Morrisseys career  as he has quoted Wilde and referenced Woolf  the sincerity of this statement has never been in doubt. If the opening of 1985s How Soon is Now immediately lodges itself in the memory  I am the son / And the heir / Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar / I am the son and heir / Of nothing in particular  it is partly due to George Eliot.
To be born the son of a Middlemarch manufacturer, and inevitable heir to nothing in particular, wrote Eliot of the dissolute Oxford dropout Fred Vincy in her novel. Morrissey may be drawing a parallel between himself and socially climbing Fred, but it seems more likely that he just enjoyed the sound of the phrase and the exaltedness of the source. There has always been the sense that, for Morrissey, literature provided not only verbal inspiration but a form of class escape.
Though pop had nodded before towards books  Poe and Burroughs appeared on the cover of Sergeant Pepper, Led Zeppelin made fair use of J. R. R. Tolkien, and of course there was Bob Dylan  by the 1980s the references were coming more thickly, and they showed increasing literary discernment. Kate Bush became famous in 1978 with a hummable prcis of Emily Bront and ended the 1980s with The Sensual World, a song that adapts Molly Blooms closing monologue in Ulysses. Scritti Politti, who took their name from Antonio Gramsci, released a single titled Jacques Derrida (Im in love with Jacques Derrida / Read a page and know what I need to). The Cures early song Killing An Arab is based on an episode in Camuss Ltranger and their track How Beautiful You Are is a rewriting of a Baudelaire poem. In 1988, the Sisters of Mercy made the Top 20 with a song, Dominion, that quoted both Shelleys Ozymandias and T. S. Eliots Gerontion. For a few years, it seemed, you werent authentically rock and roll unless you were also conspicuously well read.
Why this ever happened, and why it no longer appears to be the case, is one for the sociologists as well as the pop historians. Many of the stars of the 1980s were first picking up their instruments around the time of the early punk rock releases. Punk, branded by the Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McClaren and their sleeve artist Jamie Reed with the apothegms of the Situationist International, always had a smack of learnedness about it: if you wanted really to grasp the Pistols and the others, you were required to do a little background reading. No future, perhaps, except in the public library. Few are the 1980s musicians, too, who wouldnt cite David Bowie, avid self-educator, as a model. Educational conservatives might point to the fact that many band members of the era came of age before the end of selection in UK state secondary schools; it is tempting to invoke the figure of the grammar school boy with his grounding in Latin and his several poems learned by heart (though Morrissey, for one, failed his 11-plus exam).
It also shouldnt be forgotten that literate pop is still being made. Radiohead have taken repeatedly from J. G. Ballard since the 1990s (one of their songs is called Airbag); in 2007, Klaxons scraped the Top 40 with the single Gravitys Rainbow (though the lyrics didnt greatly enhance any reading of Thomas Pynchons novel); and P. J. Harvey, when promoting her 2011 album Let England Shake, made much of the influence on the record of Harold Pinter and T. S. Eliot. But these are occasional activities largely on pops settled, adult-orientated fringes.
The noisiest and most ubiquitous songs of the moment are no longer scattered with allusions to books and writers. If you believe that popular music is at its best when it channels ideas and fantasies from outside its own confines  even risking accusations of pretentiousness in the process  this has to be considered a loss.

Bileeta celebrates  seventh anniversary
Bileeta, a company with an award-winning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) solution, celebrates its 7th year.
Bileeta was started with the intention of offering a world-class product and CEO Sanji De Silva says the company was launched with ERP 6.0. Then, as technology was evolving rapidly and moving to Cloud and Mobiles, Bileeta capitalized on this trend and pioneered in developing a Cloud-based ERP solution called Entution, which is a comprehensive ERP solution based on a brand new concept called Journeys.
The uniqueness of this solution is that it is designed to simplify the user experience to any customer compared to traditional ERP solutions, said De Silva. Among the many advantages of Entution is the easy facilitation of overall business transactions, accuracy, visibility, minimizing human errors, staff efficiency, reduction of operational costs.
An added advantage is the affordability as the customers will not have to buy licenses or any hardware but instead can use the software on a subscription basis.
During the seven-year journey, the company has won numerous awards, both locally and internationally. In 2014 Bileeta was recognised as the Overall Winner with a Gold award at NBQSA for Entution.
An award at the Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Awards brought international fame which has now given the company leverage to take the product overseas. In the same year, CTO, Sanka Weerasinghe, was awarded the Peoples Leader in IT award for his contribution towards people management practices.
As a truly Sri Lankan company, we are proud of our achievements and our successes in digitally transforming small, medium and large companies, including those in the government and private sector, said Sanka Weerasinghe.
According to Weerasinghe, one of the key factors of the companys success is the employees. We recruit our staff through a comprehensive testing procedure.
We encourage and nurture these employees through continous on-the-job training, knowledge transfer and appraisals.
Envisaging on future plans, De Silva emphasizes that with the success of their Cloud-based ERP in the local market and having gained international recognition, his team is in the process of exploring overseas markets.
During the last year, we had rapid growth of local client base and we are excited to be pitching our product to others. Year on year we double our clients which means the demand is high and that encourages us to enhance the product further, he said.

Blueberries beat the baby blues!
New mothers can ward off the sadness and mood swings that often follow the birth of a child by taking three dietary supplements including blueberry juice, a study suggests.
In the first week after giving birth, about three quarters of women experience the baby blues, which usually fade within days. Those with severe cases are about four times more likely to go on to have post-natal depression, which affects one in eight mothers. Scientists in Canada say the blues can be prevented by giving women a handful of pills containing the raw materials that their brains need to make up for the chemical changes they go through after the end of pregnancy.
Two doses of concentrated blueberry juice, which helps to prevent oxidation damage to the brains messenger chemicals, as well as two compounds that are essential for making those chemicals, can virtually eliminate post-partum melancholy, according to a small clinical trial.
The researchers argue that the nutraceutical treatment could also be an effective way of protecting some women from post-natal depression, although this has yet to be demonstrated.
Post-partum blues are thought to be largely the indirect result of a sudden decline in a new mothers sex hormones. As these chemicals dissipate, there is a corresponding rise in the levels of a brain enzyme known as monoamine oxidase A, which breaks down several molecules linked to happiness and motivation, including dopamine and serotonin.
A group led by Jeffrey Meyer, from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, speculated that giving women the ingredients might banish the blues.
They recruited 41 pregnant women in their late 20s and early 30s, roughly half of whom were about to give birth for the first time. Starting three days after the births, the researchers gave half of the women two blueberry drinks, 2g of tryptophan and 10g of tyrosine. The rest were not given any supplements.
The results, in the journal PNAS, indicate that the treatment worked: the depression scores for most of the mothers in the control group rose swiftly after birth, while those in the nutraceutical group barely changed. The Times

Body burden
The 21st century living is showing some interesting developments  have we being too creative and are about to pay the price for being so Has our temporary applications taken permanent abode within us thus changing who we are Time will tell but the results at present is indicating us to take note of and take real due care. The answer lies not in purging ourselves with the unwanted but more so with purging our heads from the imbalanced smartness that we appear to demonstrate.
We walk into a supermarket and avail ourselves many a product which contains a multitude of chemicals to realize some specific property. Sometimes we gladly embraced bottles filled with chemicals because the aroma that the spray gives to us is quite pleasing and titillate our senses and perhaps those who are around as well. Instead of getting rid of a negative smell we tend to mask the negative with a product purchased to give an acceptable perception.
With some analysis we may find that we actually spend more on these products than on our food. While the chemicals that we have introduced, synthesized and produced, in large numbers have resulted in some extensions to our average life span, have yielded a higher quality of life, there are indications that some of these developments may actually turn out to be not too wholesome after all.
Today we speak of having introduced more than one million chemicals and most are finding their way into commercial operations, services and products. Everyday many are coming across a wonder chemical. Check the price of a high end perfume and one may understand the power of a chemical ingredient in turning both heads and commerce around.
Newer chemicals
Introduction of these newer chemicals as constituents to our bodies and their permanent resident status stemming from fat solubility means that we are modified! Today I am more than I am because I appear to harbour about seven hundred foreign chemicals and related residues which are termed as our chemical body burden.
It does not matter from where I come from and where I live because this burden appears to be ubiquitous. This value appears to be true even for those from remote corners far away from the active human centres. The term body burden refers to the total amount of chemicals that are present in the human body at a given point in time.
Sometimes it is also useful to consider the body burden of a specific, single chemical, like, for example, lead, mercury, PCB (polycholorinated biphenyls) or dioxin. These chemicals that we use tend to leave a more lasting imprint in our bodies and in the environment.
They also move from one place to another and demonstrate preferences in settling down in some preferred locations.
Our bodily fat appears to be one such place. Such migrations and the ability to accumulate have meant today a new born getting exposed to some of our modern miracles even before they have a chance to enter to this world  to the developing fetus through the placenta.
Subsequently they may also find that breast milk too is not the most preferred and important as it is shown to be. The unique importance of breast milk has not changed it is the contaminants that are being increasingly shown to be present in mothers milk that concerns the researchers.
Absence of strict quality criteria
Due to vigilant groups issues have surfaced and ability to take action had emerged. However, the current manufacturing scenarios have two types of manufacturers. Those engaged in responsible manufacture, once potential issues come to light take proactive steps in implementing findings and staying clear of bad ingredients.
They would not mind stopping production or removing ingredients even if there is no immediate substitute being available to realize the primary property. Then there are manufacturers who only consider the specific property and would continue to use the chemicals in spite of new evidence. With the same product manufactured in two different locations the rogue production actually puts the user in danger.
Another serious aspect to note is that these sub standard products do appear with a lower price tag which makes purchasing much more a complex issue.
This we experience daily by saying products from one country is cheaper than from another and we witness many a purchasing decision going the way of the cheaper option in the absence of strict quality criteria. When chemicals are ingredients of a complex product one may have to go into extreme depth with detailed criteria if one wants to ensure consumer protection.
What is responsible behaviour It is interesting to note how one company through the normal monitoring mechanism but with positive corporate commitment identified and took steps with respect to a particular group of chemicals even though at the time they were an excellent revenue generator.
The story as reported in US press and by Gregory Unruh in Earth Inc. is as follows; It was in 1997, that 3M made a surprising discovery during a routine check of factory workers blood. As expected, the blood of all the 3M employees had small quantities of the chemical perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)  a key input used in the production of 3Ms renowned stain-resistant spray Scotchgard. The problem was with the control samples taken from nonemployees. Since the people in the control group had never been in the plant or exposed to the production process, their blood should have been clean. It wasnt.
Detectable concentrations of PFOS turned up in all of them. Hoping there was some mistake; 3Ms medical director got samples from six hundred Red Cross donors and tested them. There was PFOS in all of these samples too. He then obtained samples from Europe, comfortably far away from the 3M facility. They all tested positive. It seemed that everyone in the world was contaminated with 3Ms product. And not just people. Polar bears in the Arctic, birds in Japan  just about everywhere anyone looked they found 3Ms PFOS.
Credit should indeed go to those who took great pains and efforts to pursue an odd finding to the identification of a global problem of persistence of synthetic chemicals. To its credit 3M voluntarily shut down its PFOS plant, a business that had been profitable for over fifty years. 3M demonstrated thus the answer to my question. How many would behave in this manner is a key question to answer when thinking about responsible corporate behaviour.
We are yet not fully aware of the consequences of the chemical body burden and the concentration at which point they would actually cause an adverse effect. However, we cannot wait to determine the value before taking action either.
That is why chemicals such as PFOSs which raised much interest and subsequently concern at 3M are subjected to international protocols  Stockholm convention  today. At present a study has been completed and an action plan developed in Sri Lanka after preparing a national inventory of these chemicals.
We have observed many deficiencies in our system in the process which demands corrective action.
PCB is one chemical that is in the list of banned chemicals under the Stockholm Convention. PCB at one stage was a quite a useful chemical being used in number of critical applications. PCB was used in coolant system of capacitors, transformers and electric motors.In USA one of the major users of PCBs, General Electric (GE) had released between 500,000 lbs and 1,500,000 lbs of Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) into the Hudson River during their production operations and this became a major environmental issue subsequently. GE facilities along the river apparently had released the waste chemicals over a 30 year period. PCBs are now known to be responsible for a range of health issues from lower IQ, neurological disorders to cancer. PCB can enter the body from eating contaminated fish, inhaling the volatilized chemical, drinking contaminated water and absorption through the skin. PCB contamination is considered especially dangerous for pregnant and lactating women. In a recent study published by the Simon Fraser University of Canada they demonstrated that in a sample of children studied in United States they had identified the presence of PCB in all of them  ie 100% presence which is not at all a positive find.
The 21st century living thus is quite complex. While we go on in search of quality, comforts and convenience and superior properties we have to understand the short, medium and long term risks that may be emerging. This calls for parallel work from both the manufacturers and regulators.
The responsibility on the manufacturer is not to use an ingredient when the body of knowledge indicates warning signals and not to act with bias towards superior properties claiming incompleteness of knowledge. Chemicals once greeted with Nobel Prizes such as DDT are today similarly subjected to international protocols.
Today we say when we walk about we may be giving shelter to around 700 foreign chemicals within our body. We inhale, swallow them or absorb them through our skin. These three routes are prone to abuse and we at times have very little control too.
This knowledge has come through detailed experimentation of some dedicated researchers and through techniques developed by another set of dedicated researchers. Yet within our national boundaries our abilities in testing our own unique body burden is difficult due to the limited availability of testing facilities. This implies too our inabilities in differentiating quality products vs rogue products that may be entering our markets based on cost effective considerations which usually dominates the decision making process.
There is a need in developing internal monitoring capability along with relevant human resource developments. Otherwise we observe that for even simple monitoring we have to reach out to external bodies at great expenses.
Couple of analysis points does not tell the whole story. It is not possible to seek greater quality of life without an investment in instruments and implementation of systems such as Global Harmonised Code that enable sustenance of our progress with due care. Responsible use of chemicals is the way forward if we are not to become walking chemical repositories.
