Accessible Cricket where Everybody is included
Cricket, like football and rugger, is very much a spectator sport. ICC periodically gives Sri Lanka Cricket a big sum of money for upgrading facilities for spectators at international match venues.
BUT regrettably . all past leaders of Sri Lanka Cricket, including the ministers for sports, have not found it imperative to invest in establishing toilets, refreshment areas and seating facilities  even in the VIP Boxes  safely to accommodate the countrys largest minority  spectators with restricted mobility, wheelchair users in particular.
Two elders and several wheelchair users have communicated with me to express their grief on being denied their right to come and witness the last test-match innings of our legendary Kumar Sangakkara  for want of accessible and safe facilities.
This situation was worse when crickets most prestigious mega-event, the World Cup, came here last. We had nine matches, including a semi-final, and a big sum of money was given well ahead of time by the ICC for upgrading facilities at match venues.
When doing so, highest equal priority should be given to inclusion with safety and dignity of the countrys 20% of the population with restricted mobility.
Here we are talking of near five Million of people includes the growing number of seniors, (over 65 years are fast approaching 18% of our population!), victims of the war, those including the youth living with numerous debilitating medical conditions and the convalescing.
We also have an unaccounted number of permanent users of mobility-aides such as wheelchair, crutches, frames, etc.
Many of these people are young and cricket loving. They are the very people who have the desire and time to come and see a match but they are denied that right.
In fact Participation restrictions with activity limitations are now recognised internationally as a human rights violation issue.
Failure to provide safe and equal access to a facility or equal treatment in a service  that is what we, still, see at sports stadia - constitutes discrimination.
Supreme Court ruling of 27 April 2011
The Supreme Court recognises that: People have different levels of ability to move freely, and that many are restricted in their movement to varying degree.
This Court further recognises that: No person should be discriminated against on the ground of their mobility restriction in a manner which precludes or impedes them from enjoying equally their Inherent Right to Access, safety and accommodation in day-to-day life at public buildings, public places and facilities provided there.
This ruling is mandatory by law for approving building plans and also issuing certificate of conformity. It covers newly constructed, renovated and upgraded facilities at cricket and all sports stadia.
Those holding top positions in cricket and all sports along with the Minister for Sports here must give serious thought to these ever increasing vital segments of our population and comply with the laws of the country.
They must setup the framework to activate immediately this dormant accessibility legislation and ensure this law is effectively implemented in sports that will also then strengthen the rule of law in Sri Lanka.
Real Corporate Social Responsibility
Business giants spend big money to bring live television coverage of these sporting events. Administrators cry that television has deterred the crowds from coming to witness even a test match, an ODI or T20 and thereby drastically reduces the profits each hosting club needs for their survival and the betterment of its players.
But in rugger, football and cricket, we have a commodity with unlimited potential for entertainment and togetherness in an excellent social environment.
A proper investment strategy CAN still reverse this sad trend and thereby optimise the profits.
Accessible Cricket for all concept has been proved a big success in England in particular as a lucrative business opportunity.
But in Sri Lanka its still an untapped low cost feasible investment bringing rich dividends.
Even the hospitality boxes and pavilions belonging to reputed business giants who spend big money to promote live telecasts and talk highly about their corporate social responsibility, continue to deny wheelchair users and many seniors, the facilities enjoyed by others in same society.
Even then, there are not even properly designed toilet and restaurant facilities - the most essential two needs during several hours stay  that are accessible to those with restricted ability at most reputed sports venues.
Businessmen should embrace human diversity
Many business organisations are readier to offer sympathy and a helping hand than empathy for ENABLING and EMPOWERING. But if these business organisations could as part building their image as a peoples caring company, INVEST 10% of that big ADDITIONAL money they happily spend for few seconds of their TV commercials on match days to promote Accessible Cricket for All, those rupees would make sports stadia enabling for the widest possible range of potential spectators, and thereby touching hearts and benefiting thousands of cricket, rugger and football loving spectators.
It would also do tremendous good to the game, the clubs and also the country! That would be REAL Corporate Social Responsibility!!
Accessibility experts  our missing link
ABILITY is DIVERSE. Designing for inclusion of all people is an essential investment and a highly responsible task involving time, effort and money. Hence, authorities undertaking construction should seek expert guidance as to how best to do this right, first time!
Accessibility experts perform a highly specialised job, which is still, under-estimated and unrecognized in Sri Lanka.
They require a good in-depth understanding of intricacies backed by adequate practical experience and thorough working knowledge that goes far beyond than what our university courses on architecture and civil engineering teach.
It is NOT one where standards and specifications can just be read and applied in vital tasks.
Accessible Tourism - An essential investment for Cricket
It is encouraging to know that Sri Lanka Tourism has an ambitious plan to promote tourism here through King Cricket. Those spectators with restricted mobility forming the largest minority must have the right to accessible accommodation at all hotels and motels in and round sports stadia.
Independent surveys confirm that it is the senior sports loving public from the West, Australia and UAE who have the time, big purchasing power, spending capacity, and the inclination to travel out of season and not be perturbed by unwarranted fears. But they find difficulty here in identifying essential facilities including toilets  even at our star-hotels and guest houses that cater for their reduced ability needs.
This needs to change  and change soon  in the interests of all people and of the economy. It should soon be an implemented policy of Sri Lanka that no sports stadia or hotels should be allowed to waste our limited assets with man building more physical barriers to man. Justice delayed is justice denied and, in this case, loss of profits and the countrys good name too!

Amla stands firm against England
Cape Town, Monday: South African captain Hashim Amla defied England's bowlers and batted throughout the third day of the second Test at Newlands on Monday.
Amla made an unbeaten 157 as South Africa reached 353 for three at the close, still 276 runs behind England's first innings total of 629 for six declared.
AB de Villiers was the only batsman dismissed during the day as South Africa, 1-0 down in the four-Test series, dug in on a pitch which offered no assistance to the bowlers.
Steven Finn was the only successful bowler. He had De Villiers caught at midwicket shortly before tea after Amla and De Villiers had put on 183 in a third wicket partnership which lasted for two minutes short of five hours.
Faf du Plessis, who like Amla had endured a lean spell with the bat, made 51 not out as he helped his captain put on an unbeaten 85 for the fourth wicket.
It was a crucial innings for Amla, who was under pressure for both his captaincy and his batting. South Africa have not won a Test since beating the West Indies at the same venue a year ago, while Amla had made only 150 runs at an average of 15.00 in 10 innings since that match. It was a triumph of technique and concentration as he made his first Test century since he hit 208 against the West Indies in Centurion in December 2014. By the close he had batted for nine hours and 26 minutes and had faced 371 balls. His innings included 21 fours.
After the worst year of his international career, Amla had two strokes of luck. He was dropped by James Anderson at slip off Joe Root when he was on 76 and by Nick Compton at backward point off Steven Finn when he had 120.

Australia pulls out of U19 WC - ICC invites Ireland as replacement
Australia has pulled out of the ICC under 19 Cricket World Cup starting on January 27 in Bangladesh citing security concerns and safety of its team.
The Australian senior team also pulled out of a tour to Bangladesh last October for the same reasons.
The International Cricket Council in a media release today said it will continue to prepare for the tournament despite Australia withdrawing its team from the event and expressing its concerns about the safety and security of its squad and management.
The ICC explained that its own security manager and an independent security agency had been working very closely with the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the Bangladesh security agencies, and that the planned security arrangements satisfactorily mitigate the risks identified such that it remains appropriate for the event to continue as planned.
The ICC further announced that it has invited Ireland, as the runner-up in the qualifying event in Kuala Lumpur in October, to replace Australia in the 19-day tournament. "Whilst the ICC notes and respects the position of Cricket Australia, which we understand is based on an advice received from the Australian Government we are obviously disappointed with the decision.
"The ICC takes its responsibilities around the safety and security of ICC events extremely seriously. And taking into consideration the full and unequivocal support of the Bangladesh government that has been afforded to us at the highest level and through all local security agencies, the advice we have received from our own and independent security experts, and the robust security plan that has been developed, the ICC remains of the view that it is appropriate for event planning to continue as scheduled," ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said.
"Naturally, as part of that planning process, the ICC's own security team, supported by an independent security agency, will continue to monitor closely the situation in Bangladesh, including all travel advisories provided by relevant government agencies.
"Security plans associated with an event of this size and stature are always subject to continual review to ensure that they remain appropriate and fit for purpose, and this event is no different.
"The ICC U19 Cricket World Cup is an extremely important event on the ICC calendar, which has a reputation of producing international stars. We remain confident that the ICC, in conjunction with the BCB, will be able to successfully deliver this event in Bangladesh," Richardson concluded.

Australia to push for day-night Ashes Test  Sutherland
Sports Letter:
A poser for ICC
I refer to your article under the caption Govt. Seeks ICC help to inquire into financial irregularities and corruption at SLC in your CDN of January 4th 2016.
Since a probe for the period 2011 to 2014 of SLC has been completed and the report handed over to the Minister of Sports, the above assistance from the ICC must be to probe the activities of the Govt. appointed Interim committee under the Chairmanship of Sidath Wettimuny. That is a good thing and why not
It is strange however that the ICC has reached such understanding with the Government on matters that are purely internal to SLC to be under supervision of ICC and the Government of Sri Lanka.
Early last year, the ICC threatened suspension on Sri Lanka Cricket when the Minister of Sports Navin Dissanayake appointed an Interim Committee without conducting elections. The ICC says they do not tolerate government interference into the activities of their Members, but how come now.
How funny things keep changing around. I wonder what ICC has to say about all this It is anyway good that Interim Committees are also probed not only elected bodies. The Government should also probe the
D.S. de Silva Interim Committee with the supervision of ICC for bringing SLC to bankruptcy a few years back.

Sydney, Tuesday: Cricket Australia chief James Sutherland said Tuesday he will talk to his England counterparts about the prospect of scheduling a day-night Ashes Test in Australia in the 2017-18 series.
Sutherland said he has mentioned the possibility "in passing" with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) about playing a day-night Test in the next Ashes series.
Sutherland said he has already spoken to South Africa and Pakistan authorities about playing a day-night Test in Australia next summer following the success of the concept in Adelaide in November last year.
The historic Adelaide match against New Zealand attracted a total attendance of 123,736 fans over three lively days. The opening day gate of 47,441 was the biggest at the Adelaide Test since the famous 1932-33 'bodyline' series.
Sutherland said it would be logical that the continuing success of further day-night Tests in the next Australian summer would make it an attractive proposition to schedule a day-night Test in the Ashes series in the following season.
"We will be actively pursuing at least one day-night Test this year with our two visiting teams, South Africa and Pakistan," Sutherland told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
"And I guess on the assumption that we do play a day-night Test next summer or two that we will progress that further and it will be more of a fixture in our calendar.
"Needless to say the summer after that is an Ashes series and probably that just established tradition will continue."
Sutherland said England administrators were progressive thinkers and would be interested in the day-night Test concept.
"Only (spoken to them) in passing, nothing official and to be honest it's a long way off, but I know that the chairman (Giles Clarke) and chief executive (Tom Harrison) of the ECB are very progressive in their thinking about the game," he said.
"With CEO Tom Harrison's background in the media he'll certainly understand growing the popularity of the game is first and foremost in our minds as cricket administrators."
Sutherland said the Adelaide Test had shown the cricket public's curiosity and acceptance of day-night Test cricket.
"The point is that the hours of the Test match, if they are shifted in such a way that they move into the afternoon and evening, what Adelaide showed us is that more people will turn up to watch the matches and more people will be watching on television," he said.
"That's what we want Test cricket to be -- more accessible to the public than it is now and Adelaide was proof of that concept and we're going to see lots more day-night Test cricket in future."

## Title: A brief note on Sumitra Peries
## Supertitle: [Stars of Yesteryear]

[Stars of Yesteryear]
A brief note on Sumitra Peries
She has been called, among other things, a "poetess" of our film industry. Professor Carlo Fonseka lays out a more nuanced description: the "Mother of the Father" of Sinhala cinema. Both go some way in grasping her pithily, but there's something that seems to elude commentators here, something she herself has held back from them. I am of course not suggesting that words can't do justice to her, but then again, in an industry where words are a distraction and the image is held as sacred, filmmakers remain indefinable even through the eyes of the biographer. This week's star is no exception to this, I believe, and thankfully so.
With more than five films to her name, Sumitra Peries deserves as much introduction as all those other directors here who forged a personal idiom in their work. She has her views on film craft, and after much discussion I doubt I've even come close to finding out what they may be. So rooted in their settings, and full of empathy for their women, those films of hers (made at a time when men were said to make the moves in the industry) stand out, though not always in a way which attracts unqualified praise. Inevitably: in this country, after all, praise has never been free of caveat.
Sumitra's biography has been written extensively many times before, so delving into it lengthily will serve little purpose. After all, snippets from her childhood and teenage years - her upbringing under the shadow of a powerful political family (the Gunawardena clan hailing from Boralugoda); her education at Visakha Vidyalaya (where she was branded a "leftist"); her voyage along the Mediterranean in search of her pipe-smoking brother; and her schooling at the London School of Film Technique towards the end of the 1950s (the only woman enrolled there at the time) - would fit a Hollywood scrapbook!
And in a way, this may be what has infused that sense of daring and courage we see in many of her films. To start things off I put to her that most of the criticism levelled at her films is based on how THEY think she views the women in them. Profiling Sri Lankan Cinema captures this best: "Although she deals with the loves and lives of women, she is unable, in many of her films, to break out of the patriarchally sanctioned framework that has been privileged and has held sway in Sri Lankan cinema." I would disagree: the fact that a patriarchal society overwhelms the wives, mothers, and daughters resident in her films doesn't take away our sympathy for them, something most critiques of her seem to miss.
Sumitra is cautious in her reply. "The women in my films almost always lose, yes. But in my world they are the sufferers. I can't manipulate reality, and the reality in my day was pretty much presented in my first few films." What this implies, of course, is that her later films were different, and I would agree: Nadeeka Gunasekera from Yahalu Yeheli is not Vasanthi Chathurani from Ganga Addara or Gehenu Lamayi. In the latter two films, all the woman can do is to either bemoan her cruel fate or kill herself in the face of oppression. In the former film, that woman has changed: she is independent enough to defy both family and father, features of the same "patriarchally sanctioned framework" that critics find fault with in Sumitra's films.
To consider this as her signature is both correct and wrong. Women reside in Sumitra's world, true, and it is through the deeply felt poignancy of their plights that our empathy is evoked. But reading her work this way misses out several other aspects to her work. I think she herself sums this up best: "I'm not 'committed' in an excessively political way. But I don't think you have to be political to evoke sympathy for the downtrodden."
I think the central trope that binds her films is based on gender differentials. At times however, this is superseded by another trope: class differentials.
How even or uneven her films are can be judged by how well these two tropes coincide. In Gehenu Lamayi, for instance, the central drama of the conflict - between the landed bourgeoisie represented by Ajith Jinadasa and the peasantry represented by Vasanthi Chathurani - is rarely if at all subsumed by the tension generated by the romance between the two. In Ganga Addara, on the other hand, the central conflict, which is represented by the class-gap between Chathurani and Sanath Gunathilake, is effectively made an instrument of melodrama.
Many of her films were vindicated at the box-office, particularly Ganga Addara. In an industry which has almost always sustained an inverse relationship between critical and commercial appeal, this too is notable, though perhaps not surprising: Sumitra has frequently gone for adaptations of authors who have struck a chord with youth, particularly Karunasena Jayalath.
I noted at the beginning that the labels like "poetess" do scant justice to Sumitra. I still stand by this.
They imply that she's "different", that her films are "feminine" in some outlandish way, and that her empathy for women comes out from personal experience. No, I don't deny that a film like Gehenu Lamayi has an experience.
But demarcating her as a poetess due to this betrays the same "framework" which the authors of Profiling Sri Lankan Cinema find to be affirmed in her work. How By implicitly considering her films as "quirks" in our cinema, "freakish" in their conception and by their views on gender relations.
I've come across comments like this as well. Suffice it to say that they are crass and ridiculous, if at all for the reason that they tend to devalue her stature as a courageous filmmaker on her own right. I point this out to Sumitra by telling her that notwithstanding the honesty and courage invested in her work, many of her critics are bothered only by the fact that despite the director being a woman, the women in her films are never vindicated. I add that had she heeded their call and altered the way her characters are portrayed, they would lose half the authenticity and spontaneity that distinguish them to date. She smiles. By way of agreement, I'd like to think.
In this sense I think the observation made at the end of the essay on her in Profiling Sri Lankan Cinema is misplaced: "Clearly Sumitra has not gone far enough as a director with feminist interests. But then no one else has either." To judge films made about women with the criterion one uses for feminist pamphlets is, in my mind, a little erroneous, something driven home by the fact that NONE of the directors (in her day) venerated for their empathy towards women can be classed under the "feminist" tag. Why judge her films on this basis ALONE, then
These reflections provoke debate and discussion. That's not for an article or two. That's for an entire book. No one to my mind, however, has approached Sumitra Peries' life and work this way, a pity considering how enriched her works are if they're read in more ways than one.
This is certainly exemplified in her masterpiece, Sagara Jalaya. I tell Sumitra that the ending of that film, with the fiercely independent Heen Kelle (Swarna Mallawarachchi, in her best role) left at a crossroads and her son writing a letter to his uncle asking for a job, is the most powerfully intense in the history of our cinema. The anguish reflected in that sequence, in my opinion, is hard to replicate even today. That goes a long way in evoking sympathy for woman and child in light of contemporary reality, certainly a better way than that demanded by those who claim that her work is unsatisfactory on the basis of feminist ambitions.
Sumitra Peries, in short, has (like her husband, I should add) been subject to relentless and not always justifiable criticism, much of which has centred on a crass and downright incorrect reading of her work. Let me put it this way: I've come to appreciate works of art for how they relate to context and reality.
The best praise the artist can receive (we're told) is that his or her work is perennial DESPITE this. But I'm not happy with such a categorisation of art. I'd like to alter this, hence: the best praise an artist SHOULD get is that his or her work resists the strands of time, and is always subject to transformation in the hands of the critic, from one period of time to the other.
Judging by this, Sumitra has (happily) had her share of praise. As I pointed out before however, that praise has not been unqualified, inevitable in a small industry (and country) such as ours.
This isn't to say that she's gone unnoticed. It's just that, when it comes to analysing her conception of the cinema, people have let their biases for or against it colour their verdicts on how well she has stuck by it. We need to re-evaluate her radically, I believe. And fast.

Djokovic claims first win of season in 51 minutes
Doha, Monday: Novak Djokovic took just 51 minutes to win his first game of 2016, easily beating Dustin Brown 6-2, 6-2 in the opening game of the Qatar Open on Monday.
The world number one was rarely troubled by the German and barely raised a sweat, cruising into the second round with an ominous display for rivals looking for any early-season weaknesses from Djokovic after his dominant 2015.
"It was a very good start," Djokovic told reporters afterwards.
He said he was untroubled by the blustery and relatively cold weather in Doha, with temperatures reaching 17 degrees Celsius (62 Fahrenheit).
"Considering the weather conditions and everything, I think it was a good performance from my side.
"I played a player who I never faced before and somebody who is a very charismatic guy and very good for tennis, for sport and somebody who is very unpredictable.
"He hasn't served particularly well today, which I think has helped me."
Djokovic said before the tournament started that he is in Doha to win and not merely play some warm-up matches before the defence of his Australian Open crown later this month.
And he certainly served notice of that, racing to a 5-0 lead in the first set in just 16 minutes.
Brown belatedly rallied, holding his serve for the first time in the sixth game and then breaking the Serb's serve to make it 5-2.
The world number 118 then had two points to claim a third successive game but double-faulted twice, allowing Djokovic to claim the first set in just 25 minutes.
The second set followed a similar pattern as Djokovic, 28, swatted aside any potential resistance from Brown -- who famously beat Rafael Nadal in the second round at Wimbledon last year -- by breaking serve in the fourth game to take a 3-1 lead.
That was pretty much the end of Brown, a qualifier for the tournament, and the contest.
The 31-year-old rarely threatened the Serb's serve and it ended in sorry fashion as Brown delivered his fourth double fault of the night to end the match.
Djokovic, making his second appearance in Qatar, was watched on by coach Boris Becker, the first winner of the Qatar Open back in 1993.
There were also first round victories on Monday for France's Jeremy Chardy, Robin Haase of the Netherlands, Bosnian Damir Dzhumhur and British qualifier Kyle Edmund.
Tuesday will see number two seed Nadal, Tomas Berdych, seeded three, and defending champion and number four seed David Ferrer all play their first round matches.
In the second round, Djokovic will play the winner of Fernando Vasco and Malek Jaziri, who play on Tuesday.

DS Senanayake OBU motor rally on Saturday
The DS Senanayake Old Boys Unions (OBU) much looked forward to fund raising motor rally will take place on Saturday, January 9.
The motor rally which was the first such motor sports event started by an Old Boys Association has been held annually since 2004 and is a much looked forward event in the schools OBU calendar.
The rally run on the Time-Speed-Duration (TSD) format will witness about 60 vehicles starting out from the school premises along a specified route covering approximately 135km to conclude at the Laya Leisure Resort at Kukuleganga.
The event has grown in interest among the old boys and over the years has grown in numbers and standard with the event nearing a professional TSD rally.
Approximately 60 competitiors are expected to traverse a route covering gravel and tarmac roads suited for cars and jeeps along the scenic outskirts of major cities such as Homagama, Gelanigama, Mathugama and Bulathsinhala. Although the event is held as a competition, the focus is on fun and friendship.
With the growing standards of the event, the OBU has outsourced the conduct of the event to the Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC) this year. CMSC is the oldest motor sports club in Sri Lanka with experience in conducting one of the oldest rallies in the country and is affiliated to FIA, the international governing body for motor sports.
The drivers will be given their route instructions on a professional easy to understand tulip charts to navigate the course based on a time plan and have to check in at secret check points. The drivers will be awarded debit points for failure to observe the TSD instruction and the competitor with the least debit points will be declared the winner. The rally plotting team will register the drivers at checkpoints through a mobile QR (Quick-Response) code system that will relay the check-in time to the rally control in order to ensure speedy results processing and accuracy.

How Adopting A Pet Made Our Relationship Stronger
Having both grown up with dogs in our lives, my boyfriend Aaron (now my husband) and I always knew that owning a dog was in our future. Canine companionship was something we wanted to experience together, and it felt like a natural next step in our relationship. Suddenly, after a few short months of dating, a scruffy ball of terrier energy named Leroy came bounding into our lives from a local rescue and he has been a sidekick to our adventures ever since.
Almost immediately, our relationship evolved to support our new titles as pup parents. Let me just say that even deciding on a name together was no small task, and the decisions that followed came quickly and in abundance. Being responsible for another life form outside of ourselves now became paramount and tested how we tackled things as a unit. No longer were we griping about which sushi restaurant to order-in from. We were learning to communicate better through choosing the best veterinarian or pet insurance plan, and deciding who picks up the poop, or how we want to handle discipline. One of the beauties of dog ownership has been learning to practice patience and compromise with each other.
We also learned that it wasn't solely about making these particular decisions that mattered, it was about defining our long-term goals as a couple and now as a family. Learning to articulate our expectations solidified a strong foundation for us to build on.
Leroy quickly became a permanent fixture in our lives, so much so that even dog-friendly offices and apartments are now major decision factors in our careers and home life. These days, we plan every outing with Leroy in mind, always seeking out dog-friendliness -- from accommodations, to beaches and hikes, to restaurants and cafes. Leroy is the type of dog who always wants to be a part of the action, and he has kept us seeking adventure both near and far. Fortunately, we have always been an active couple, and we hope becoming owners to an energetic pup will keep us young. These kinds of experiences continually spark new stories and create new memories that bring us closer.
With all the highs and lows of dog ownership, there's nothing like learning to laugh about cleaning up accidents, and maybe even replacing a rug you've always secretly hated anyway. Our trials and tribulations in co-pet parenting have taught us to not always take things too seriously. One of the most valuable lessons we've learned in our practices is remembering to praise each other for victories of all types and sizes. Observing how a little bit of praise can go a long way with Leroy has helped us to reflect a similar approach in our relationship.
Since deciding to document our lives with Leroy through photos and stories on social media, Aaron and I have been welcomed into a supportive, active community of animal lovers both online and off. Through that community we have been able to create lasting connections with people all over the world. Adopting Leroy has taught us so much about who we are, as well as who we want to be: people who will never stop trying, and never stop loving.
He has kept us grounded and given us a strong foothold into planning our future and we are so grateful to have him along for the ride. Pets add fun, love, companionship and unconditional love to your life. Whether a dog, cat, guinea pig or bearded dragon, there's a perfect pet for everyone.

Life beyond 64 squares
Viswanathan Anand is your quintessential Chennai boy, who loves his morning walks and Tamil films. He travels around the world for tournaments, but when hes back in the city, where hes based currently, he loves it. His family opened their home for people from the nearby slums who were battling it out during the recent floods, a gesture that earned praise from many. At the launch of Toneez Fitness Centre at Nanganallur, the grandmaster took time out for a chat on the recent floods, why 2015 was a bad year and his plans for the future.
Q. Hows the year been kickstarted You are set to start travel ling for the chess season soon
A. Well, the first few days have been brilliant. I play in Gibraltar later this month and Zurich next month. Then, the Candidates is coming up, and Ill get ready for it.
Q. 2015 wasnt a particularly good year for you, both professionally and personally
A. It did seem to start off as a good year, and then everything went off the rails after Norway. Beyond the broad picture, you need to get into the technical details. Ill do that, and hopefully, that will help things with the next tournament.
Q. Personally too, it was a really tough year. Your mother, who got you into chess, passed away, and you lost your close Spanish friend, Maurice, as well
A. A year hasnt passed by, and I remember amma constantly. Obviously, everyone has a relationship with their mother, but mine goes back pretty far. And you appreciate that only when theyre gone. Almost for everything, theres a connection  I often think about what she might say to certain things, what Ill say and that sort of thing. When I come back to Chennai, my first reaction is not to call her, which was happening in the beginning. That hurts a bit. I lost my friend, Maurice, who was Spanish, but I was happy that I got to see him and say goodbye.
Q. Your wife opened your home to people during the floods. Akhil, your son, must have found a lot of new friends
A. Oh yes! I was in London then; I had left Chennai on November 17{and things were already bad} flights were getting delayed, and I almost missed my connection. I thought we had it bad right then but nothing could prepare me for what I was reading in the subsequent days. The places that Id gone cycling just a few days ago suddenly had to be accessed by boats; I couldnt imagine it! And then you realise you have to visualise the whole terrain, how the water wouldve risen that high.
The best thing about the floods, of course, was the spirit of volunteerism  I dont know if we read more about it and it was always there  but I thought it was different this time.
I admired Arunas decision to take in some people and let me stay there till things settle down my son Akhil adjusted well. By the time I came back, Chennai was dry again there was no trace of what had happened. I still cannot visualise what happened in those days.
Q. Do you miss being a doting dad when youre on tour
A. In chess, theres no predictable calendar last year, I was in Chennai from February to May! I am a chess player and the job needs me to travel often.
However, when Im free, Im completely free and spend a lot of time with my son. Hell be five soon, and I guess his reaction to my leaving for tournaments is changing too.
He can play a bit of chess  he knows how to set up the pieces  but hes more into puzzles, paintings and music. We encourage him to do a lot of things, to see what sticks.
Q. Thereve been a few films on chess recently; you must like the attention the sport is getting with filmmakers
A. I was really happy with Algorithms that told the story of the struggles of a blind chess player. It wasnt a mushy film; it just put their story out and let you deal with it. You could see how angry they get when they lose, the emotions they go through and you realise that its just as competitive for them. I also liked Pawn Sacrifice  but thats because I knew the history and I wanted to see how it would be portrayed. It tells the story of Bobby Fischer; it is set about 40 years ago, and perhaps the new generation might not be too aware of Fischer. This movie will introduce him to many of them. It captured many things about chess; I was happy that both movies were released and widely seen here.
Q. Theres also Wazir, an upcoming Hindi film in which Amitabh Bachchan reportedly plays a paralysed chess grandmaster
A. Ive heard about it, and yes, I would like to check it out when it releases.
Q. Were now at the inauguration of Toneez, a fitness centre. How important is fitness for a chess player
A. Everybody needs fitness, irrespective of their profession. Any sort of mental work takes a physical toll, and you need the resources to deal with it. If youre not physically fit, your brain gets tired and you make mistakes. Thats true of any job, where you dont move a lot. I think fitness transcends your profession; it is essential for life.
Q. So, whats your fitness routine like
A. I run on alternate days and I also do quite a bit of stretches and weight training. Ive been doing it seriously for almost 20 years. Of course, fitness training evolves over age.
Q. You mentioned age. Do you think age has anything to do with excelling in chess There are still ageing champions in many sports
A. Its fairly clear that chess is a young sport, just like any other game. Maybe you get a few more years in chess, as compared to football or tennis. At this stage in my life, Im just curious to see where I can get.
Im still very motivated to try hard. Honestly, I want to play for the pleasure of playing. I know that theres a clock ticking, but I dont want to obsess about it.

New Zealand seal series win over Sri Lanka
Mount Maunganui, Tuesday: New Zealand sealed the one-day series against Sri Lanka on Tuesday with Martin Guptill's century spearheading a 36-run victory in the fifth and final one-dayer at Mount Maunganui.
Martin Guptillof New Zealandbats during thefifth one dayinternationalcricket matchagainstSri Lanka playedat the Bay Oval
in MountMaunganui onJanuary 5. AFP
Matt Henry's five-wicket bag helped ensure the hosts took a 3-1 series win to go with their 2-0 Test domination last month.
New Zealand posted 294 for 5 batting first at the popular beachside resort venue with Guptill making 102, before Sri Lanka were all out for 258 with 17 balls remaining.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews, with a brave knock of 95, had set the scene for a cliff-hanger finish when he led his side to 223 for 5 before the tail folded in six overs for the addition of only 35 runs.
The last three wickets fell for six runs in the space of 10 deliveries.
Along with Mathews, Dinesh Chandimal and Milinda Siriwardana played their part in keeping Sri Lanka in with a chance for most of the their innings. Mathews and Chandimal produced a 93-run stand for the fourth wicket before Trent Boult, making his first appearance in the series, dismissed Chandimal for 50.
After Thisara Perera (15) made a brief appearance at the crease Siriwardana and Mathews cracked 62 off 40 to have Sri Lanka at 223 for 5 with nine overs and five wickets to get the remaining 72 runs.
But when Siriwardana fell to Mitchell Santner for 39, New Zealand rammed home their advantage.
At the start of the day Guptill capped a remarkable home season with his 10th ODI century, reaching 102 in 109 deliveries to go with his 79, 93 not out, 30 and 27 earlier in the series.
When Mathews won the toss and put New Zealand into bat he had an immediate result with Tom Latham out in the first over without scoring.

But Guptill and Kane Williamson then established New Zealand's dominance with 122 for the second wicket.
Any loose ball was despatched towards the boundary with a Guptill four bringing up their century partnership in 115 balls.
But a lapse in timing by Williamson on 61 led to his undoing when he gloved an attempt to sweep a leg-side delivery from Tillakaratne Dilshan and wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal snared the catch.
Ross Taylor put on 81 for the third wicket with Guptill who was caught by Thisara Perera off Nuwan Kulasekara.
Taylor brought up his half-century with a six to mid-wicket before also falling to Kulasekara.
Sri Lanka in reply were on the back foot in the third over when Dilshan, marking his 300th ODI, was removed by Boult for five.
Henry bowled Lahiru Thirimanne for two and had Danushka Gunathilaka caught for 15 as Sri Lanka slumped to 33 for 3 after nine overs before Mathews put some respectability into their innings.
Henry, who was only required by New Zealand for three of the five matches, finished with five for 50 to give him 13 wickets in the series, while Boult took three for 43. AFP

Nothing is forgotten!
Saranga Mendis made news in the circles with his tele-drama Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli. How he brought the emotion factor into this action packed story is noteworthy. His unquenchable thirst to learn and experiment in the sphere is remarkable.
Saranga firmly believes a stage drama, tele-drama or film director is not born overnight but as a result of years of dedication towards learning the subject and working with veterans.
This humble human being is related to senior lecturer and playwright Mangala Senanayake, actress Jayani Senanayake and script writer Morris Mendis.
Saranga Mendis spoke his heart out to Daily News on his works and local tele-drama sphere. He disclosed an action-film with his direction is in the offing which is scripted at present. His leisure time is totally devoted to study newest trends in global cinema.
Excerpts of the interview...
Q. You have become a tele-drama director to reckon with. How did you enter this field
A. After leaving school I studied a two year course in creative arts at Sunera Foundation. Subsequently I worked with Prasanna Vithanage, Nalan Mendis and Harold Wijesinghe. I respect them as my mentors in the field.
Saranga Mendis with his beloved wife Chamika Mendis
Late Harold Wijesinghe taught me the theory side of television. He offered me to work as a co-director in his tele-drama Sihina Wasanthayak with Sunil Costa. This was the turning point on my quest to become a tele-drama director.
I directed the tele-drama Ganga Addara which was followed by Bharyavo and Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli.
Q. Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli was a noteworthy tele-drama.
A. People needed heroes on television. I wrote the script to give it a Robin Hood touch and it paid dividends. Cast comprised mainly of stage drama actors who knew the depth in acting. I tested all my knowhow on Gini Avi. After Dandubasna Manaya best action scenes came in Gini Avi. These were real fights and were more credible. We did 300 episodes.
Still Gini Avi DVDs are being sold in the marketplace and people comment on the web page. Gini Avi redefined local mega tele-drama and made masses ambassadors of this tele-drama.
We proved via Gini Avi the versatility of an actor is much more important than his looks. A segment of viewers who were not tele-drama lovers sat in front of TV to watch Gini Avi. Thus we revolutionized the tele-drama sphere with this tele-drama.
Q. How was the budget allocated for Gini Avi
A. We sold one episode for 115,000 LKR whereas an episode of Dandubasna Manaya was sold at 350,000LKR decades back.
Thus we worked within a limited budget though the technology is now advanced. It was a challenge for us and we had to counter the competition to have an edge.
Q. Your newest tele-drama is Dedunnai Adarae. It is presented in a completely different manner which reminds us of Indian Soap Operas.
A. We did it with a purpose. At present many TV channels tend to dub Indian tele-dramas in Sinhala and telecast. TV Derana offered me a challenge to do an original Sinhala tele-drama to counter these dubbed versions. Hence I resorted to this presentation style.
A tele-drama director or a film director for that matter should not try to project his/her image via his works. We have to adapt a style best suited for the creation. Yet our philosophy could be one. To do this a director should know his onions. I personally like to differentiate my works and reluctant to languish in one genre or style.
With Dedunnai Adarae we approached the market segment of viewers who have been watching dubbed tele-dramas. Dedunnai Adarae is not made in the Indian mould though. We only benchmarked with technical aspect of Indian tele-dramas and localized that to suit our viewers.
If you take all my tele-dramas you could see they revolve around varied styles of presentation. Prasanna Vithanage once told me presentation style is demanded by the creation itself.
The most important thing is to be sincere to your creation.
Q. Can a tele-drama have cinematic qualities
A. Tele-drama is different to cinema and we have to bare that in mind. It is a joke that in some award ceremonies awards are presented to tele-dramas which have best cinematic qualities.
If they are the best tele-dramas households must watch them since they are shown in your drawing room unlike cinema. But it doesn't happen. Why is that
Take India for an example. They have clearly separated the two spheres. They have cinemas that provide light entertainment as well as art house productions. They treat tele-drama field differently.
A scene from Gini AviSaha Ginikeli tele-drama
Q. Many actors starred in Gini Avi are cast in Dedunnai Adarae too.
A. Yes. That itself shows the prowess of those actors. They can adapt to any character with ease. Athula Jayasinghe is one good example. We have shown the viewers an actor should be able to do any character coming his way credibly. Many actors in our country cannot perform. Their performances are not credible and not felt by viewers. This is one major reason people resort to watching Indian tele-dramas. Viewers value acting over glamour.
Q. How is the dedication of new actors in the local tele-drama field
A. Dedication of many popular actors is zero I should say. But who come from stage drama sphere have the dedication and discipline. I mostly work with them. They explore for new opportunities because they have studied the subject and they are eager to confront challenges. Acting is a subject that can make you a Professor.
Many new actors and actresses seek instant popularity. They think this is a hobby. This is a profession and one should respect it. We are in a lucrative industry.
Q. What is in store for you in 2016
A. I hope to venture into cinema. Digitalization of local cinema is our hope.
My first cinema will be one like Gini Avi Saha Ginikeli or a sequel. Presently we are working on the script.

A big blow to Afghanistan as this would be their last time at the SAFF games.

Wash-out douses hopes of Australia clean-sweep
Sydney, Tuesday: Rain appears to have scuttled Australia's hopes of sweeping their series 3-0 over the West Indies after a third-day wash-out in the third and final Test on Tuesday.
The entire day was lost through rain, with the tourists on 248 for seven in their first innings and a total of 86.2 overs bowled in the first three days at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
The only chance of a result seems to be some creative declarations from rival captains Steve Smith and Jason Holder, but Windies coach Phil Simmons said the weather would have the final say.
"I think we need to see how much play we get tomorrow first," Simmons told reporters.
"One side is telling me there is showers again in the morning and now I've just heard there may be showers in the afternoon too so we've just got to see what happens tomorrow then we go from there." With no action to speak about on the field, Simmons was asked if there was a light at the end of the tunnel for his beleaguered team after two heavy Test defeats in Hobart and Melbourne.
"I think we have seen in the last three days of cricket (including Melbourne) we've had, we've improved and our batting seems to be thinking about it more and fighting a little bit harder to not give the Aussies wickets," he said.
"There is a lot of light (at the end of the tunnel) with the players and I think you can mention (Kraigg and Carlos Brathwaite) because they have got runs. "The way how (Darren) Bravo has batted in all the Test matches. The way (Rajendra) Chandrika has looked. He hasn't gone on to a big score but the way he looked early on.
"Even the captain (Holder) when he batted in the second Test on the last day you can see there's a lot there to work with."
But Simmons, who has had his brushes with the West Indies cricket board, believes for the Caribbean team to progress in Tests it will need all its best players from the three formats of the game.
While the Test team struggles, Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Darren Sammy and Andre Russell are in Australia but playing in the Twenty20 Big Bash League.
"I still have the feeling that it will always be good to get the best players from the West Indies playing all formats of the game," he said.
"If we can get that, then we will have an organisation that is moving forward.
"That is my hope now, at the end of the day we might have a solution but we still might have players that might not think they can play Test cricket, or might not really want to play Test cricket anymore.
"So when we get to that solution between the parties that are involved then we can see where that takes us."
Further rain is forecast on Wednesday. If play is possible the West Indies will resume with Denesh Ramdin on 30 and Kemar Roach yet to score.
