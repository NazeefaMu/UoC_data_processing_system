Among the twinkling stars
Heavy rains was no disturbance at all for the Lady of Victories Convent, Moratuwa, when they celebrated the 80th anniversary celebration of the Past Pupils' Association.
The Convent's present and past pupils gathered in blue and white dress that depicted their school colour. Everything, including the welcome drink, was blue.
That was a nice combination as compared to the blue skies above. It was as if Mother Mary fondly looked down to bless the convent named after her. The celebration was held at the Mount Lavinia Hotel.
Former Central Bank Assistant Governor Priyantha Fernando graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Highways and Investment Promotion Deputy Minister Eran Wickremeratne made a sudden appearance. Rev.Sisters, Esmi Rodrigo, Catheriene Perera and Sujeeva Nonis represented the Convent at the occasion.
Veteran musician Faizal Bongso made the evening colourful with the background music provided by Marians. Dushyanth Weeraman's dance troupe added an extraordinary flavor to the function. The evening commenced with an opening prayer. And then followed the dine and dance evening. They danced to their heart's content.
In between were lucky draws that offered the participants covetous prizes such as overseas trips. The draw prizes were segmented into categories such as Table Draw, Lucky Entrance Ticket Draw, best dancer, best dancing couple, best tap dancer, best baila dancing couple and best dressed lady.
Ann Dias emerged the Queen of the Night.

China joins hunt for alien life with world's biggest telescope
CHINA: Chinese scientists are constructing the world's biggest radio telescope, which will be more effective than any other at picking up weak messages from outer space that could be linked to intelligent life.
Assembly of the Five-hundred-metre Aperture Spherical Telescope, or FAST, began in July and is expected to be completed in 2016.
Once finished, the reflector dish of the telescope will be 500 metres in diameter, replacing Puerto Rico's Arecibo Observatory, only 300 metres in diameter, as the world's largest.
The wider the dish, the more effective the telescope becomes at picking up weak messages from outer space.
Nan Rendong, the chief scientist of the FAST project, told the Xinhua news agency: "A radio telescope is like a sensitive ear, listening to tell meaningful radio messages from white noise in the universe."
"It is like identifying the sound of cicadas in a thunderstorm."
Rather than sitting above ground, the telescope's dish is sunken into a natural bowl-shaped valley in China's Guizhou province.The geography of the surrounding hills and the remoteness of the site mean that there will be less interference from Earth-based radio signals. The dish will be suspended slightly above ground level by a series of strong pillars and cables, allowing operators to move it and listen in to noises coming from different parts of space. - THE INDEPENDENT

CPA to seek massive public participation in formulation of new constitution
The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has initiated a programme to obtain the highest possible participation of citizens in the formulation of the new constitution.
A civil society dialogue on Programme on Public Participation in Constitution Making was held yesterday at OPA building, Colombo to introduce civil society representatives to this programme and obtain their suggestions and ideas.
CPA Founder Executive Director Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said that in the current social background, civil society has a particular opportunity to contribute its suggestions on policy making agenda specially in the formulation of a new constitution.
"The agenda of national unity government very strongly reflects the demands, arguments, and ideas that were not put forward over the past few decades." he said.
He also said the contribution of civil society to public the policy making agenda especially for the formulation of supreme law of the country is an opportunity that we should never miss.
He also added that Sri Lankans treated the two elections held this year as a respective society.
The people were not afraid of voice their opinions on reforms, injustice, transparency.
Parliamentarian Jayampathi Wickremaratne said that under the guidance of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, a special committee has been appointed to look into the formulation of a new constitution.
"The committee is comprised of officers from all relevant authorities, such as, the Legal Draftsman's Department, Parliament and legal experts, etc," he said.
Senior CPA Researcher Lionel Guruge said the government has declared its intention in promulgating a new constitution and is taking measures to establish a Parliamentary Select Committee to work on that.
"The CPA firmly believes that the formulation of a new constitution with the proactive participation citizens is of paramount importance," he said.

Delimitation of electoral districts: Committee to scrutinize issues
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha will appoint a committee to look in to the issues and complaints with regard to the delimitation of electoral districts, Elections Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya told the Daily News yesterday.
Final decisions will be taken only after the report is published, he said.
The Elections Commissioner added that the delimitation committee report was published under the patronage of the President. However, there are conflicting opinions regarding this issue. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe do not intend to postpone the Local Government elections.
He said the Commissioner of Elections do not have the power to decide on the date of the election. This has to be decided by the Cabinet and the Parliament.
He said elections could be held before March 31, 2016.

Dog Bed
When you lie down with dogs, your emotional well-being can benefit, some experts say. Others contend pet owners who let their dogs share their bed are barking up the wrong tree.
Owners sharing beds with dogs are fairly common, according to Psychology Today. It quoted a recent survey that indicated about half of all dog owners allowed their pets to sleep in the bed with them, with the highest percentage single females between the ages of 18 and 34.
Married men over 45 years old were found most likely to kick the dog out of the bed, the survey indicated. Disagreements among couples over allowing pets in the bed are not new, Psychology Today said. It told of how 1800s Army Gen. George Armstrong Custer's wife Libbie objected so strenuously to the presence of dogs on their bed that they reached a compromise: When Custer was home the dogs could sleep in their bedroom but not on their bed. In the field, Custer shared his cot with his dogs.
For most people, having a dog in bed is psychologically comforting, Psychology Today said. It added, "The dog serves as a loving companion close at hand, and it keeps you from feeling lonely or insecure no matter how dark the night."
Touching, human or otherwise, raises levels of oxytocin in the body, creating a feeling of contentment, according to the New York Times. It said the comfort that an unconditionally loving animal provides in bed is an emotional balm, especially for the lonely, anxious, or depressed.
The Times reported that Cesar Millan, the hard-nosed dog trainer known for his former National Geographic Channel TV Series "The Dog Whisperer," agrees, though he believes the dog should be invited up - just to show it the real leader of the pack - and the human should choose the part of the bed where the dog sleeps.
Thehyperpup.com emphasizes that puppies don't remain puppies for long. As a cautionary tale, it told of an innocent 12-pound puppy that morphed into a 56-pound dog that splayed out on her back in bed like a drunken sailor, belly up, legs open, eyes closed, tongue out, and taking up half the bed.

Drones patrol skies over fire-prone areas in Indonesia
INDONESIA: Indonesia has launched two drones to patrol the skies over fire-prone areas in a bid to give emergency workers real-time alerts on hot spots, allowing them to respond faster to the fires and put them out before they spread to other areas.
The haze crisis, caused by fires burning over dry peatland in Sumatra and Kalimantan, has spread across Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, as well as parts of the Philippines and Thailand in recent weeks.
The Pollutant Standards Index (PSI) in South Sumatra, one of the worst hit areas this year, registered significant improvements with PSI levels in its capital city of Palembang, falling to 219 at 1pm on Monday after peaking at 819 in pre-dawn hours.
But in Palangkaraya, the capital of Central Kalimantan where schools were shut for more than three weeks, the PSI was at 1,059, way above hazardous levels.
The two drones, owned by state-owned aircraft manufacturer Dirgantara Indonesia, were deployed earlier on Monday (Oct 12), Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan told The Straits Times.
The specifications of the drones were not revealed but previous reports had indicated that Indonesia has drones that can operate up to a range of 200km.
The drones, which were deployed in South Sumatra's Ogan Komering Ilir regency where the concentration of the hot spots was detected, can fly for about three hours before they need to return to base to be recharged.
The Indonesian government has in the past week started multilateral firefighting operations involving Singapore, Malaysia, Russia, China and Australia. But low-visibility caused by the thick haze has hampered some of the waterbombing and cloud-seeding operations over fires in Sumatra. - STRAITS TIMES

Farcical repetition of history
There was a string of political assassinations targeting prominent Tamil politicians during the first half of the Rajapaksa rule, starting from November, 2005.
Nearly a month after former President Mahinda Rajapaksas ascension to power, a prominent Tamil Parliamentarian was shot dead by a gunman while attending a Christmas midnight mass at St. Mary's Church in Batticaloa. Pararajasingham, a journalist turned politician, was identified by many in the South for his pro-LTTE viewpoints and it was no secret that the TNAs politics, at that juncture, was eclipsed by the military power of the LTTE.
Government authorities dubbed Pararajasinghams assassination as a mysterious political killing for which no party claimed responsibility. They said only the Parliamentarians wife and his security officer, a Policeman attached to the Battocaloa Police station, were aware of the Parliamentarians decision to attend the midnight mass. His wife too was among the eight people who were injured due to the attack.
St. Mary's Church is located in a former High Security Zone between two important military camps in the East. There was ample military presence in the area and it did not require a lot of wisdom to understand that the culprits could only have escaped with the complicity of some members of the security forces. The slain Parliamentarians family had blamed that a certain paramilitary group operating in the East should be held responsible for the killing.
Quite obviously, fingers were pointed at the group led by Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan alias Karuna, who defected from the LTTE in 2004. The second in command of the Karuna group was Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan who later fell out with Karuna and became the Chief Minister of the Eastern Province.
It was common knowledge that Karunas group, which later formed the Tamil Makkal Viduthalai Puligal (TMVP) party, was hugely backed by the Sri Lankan military. For obvious reasons, the Sri Lankan military was playing the Karuna card against Prabhakaran in an attempt to gain a higher bargaining position in the faltering peace process. Random killings were taking place across the country and fingers were pointed at the LTTE and paramilitary groups, backed by the Army. Pararajasingham, Nadaraja Raviraj and T. Maheswaran were prominent Tamil politicians who got killed amidst this smokescreen created by random killings.
Saturday night drama at Pilleyans Batticaloa residence
The controversy surrounding Pararajasinghams murder took a new turn when the CID arrested two suspects last week in connection with the incident. The two suspects were former Batticaloa Municipal Council member Edwin Silva Krishnanandaraja alias Pradeep Master and Rangasami kanaganayagam alias Gajan Mama. They were close associates of former Eastern Province Chief Minister Sivanesathurai Chandrakanthan alias Pilleyan. A few days after the arrest, suspicions were directed at the former Chief Minister, an ex-militant of the LTTE, in connection with the murder.
A group of CID officers investigating into the matter left for Batticaloa on Saturday afternoon in search of the former Chief Minister, who is now a political non-entity. They first visited the personal residence of Chandrakanthan to question him over the murder. To their disappointment, the family members of the former Chief Minister informed the CID officer that he was not home and they were unaware of his whereabouts. The CID officers suspicions grew as they spotted the former Chief Ministers vehicle parked near the house. That was an indication that Chandrakanthan was attempting dodge the Police inquiry into the murder.
The CID then deployed a phalanx of security officers around the former Chief Ministers house, expecting his return at any moment. Another group visited Chandrakanthans brothers house to see if they had any information about the politicians whereabouts. They said they too were unaware of his movements.
At this point, the CID told Chandrakanthans family members to inform the former Chief Minister to be present at the CID office on Sunday at 5.00 p.m.
There was some uncertainty on Sunday as to whether the former Chief Minister would turn up for the questioning. While on his way to Colombo, he informed the CID that he was coming. The former Chief Minister, accompanied by his lawyer, arrived at the CID at 5.30 p.m. After the questioning, the CID took measures to arrest the former Chief Minister under a 72-hour detention order.
What requires emphasis is the fact that the killing took place when Karuna and Pilleyan were together, after their defection from the LTTE. There were speculations that at the time the killing took place the Karuna group had some links with the members of the security forces. However, it is too early even to speculate that members of the security forces are linked to Pararajasinghams killing. While maintaining its links with the Army, the Karuna group also waged a battle with the LTTE and Pararajasingham was a supporter of the LTTE at the time.
Eknaligoda tortured for five days and murdered in Welikanda
Investigations into Prageeth Eknaligiodas disappearance took a new turn last week with the CID teams visiting the Girithale army camp where the journalist had allegedly beenheld after his abduction, two days before the Presidential election in 2010.
The CID has already taken into custody 11 members of the military intelligence unit in connection with the journalists disappearance. The majority of suspects who are presently in custody are ex-members of the LTTE who defected from the organization with Karuna and Pilleyan. That leaves space for outsiders to draw parallels between Eknaligodas disappearance and other political killings such as Pararajasinghams murder.
The CID also took the suspects into the Girithale camp, under the protection of the military police. After perusing reports pertaining to the vehicle movement at the camp during the period of abduction, the CID got the suspects to identify the places where the journalist had allegedly been held.
According to highly placed Police sources, the journalist had been detained at the Girithale army camp for more than five days. During the first two days, he had been questioned over a booklet titled family tree and his alleged associations with former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka who was then a Presidential candidate. After questioning, the journalist had been subjected to torture for nearly three days, a Police source who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily News.
It has now been established that Eknaligoda had been detained at Girithale with the knowledge of top military officers who were in charge of the camp. It is also clear that senior officers who were handling military intelligence at the time were also aware of the abduction and the subsequent disappearance. As a result, several big names in the Army have already come under the searchlights of investigators, sending ripples across the countrys defence establishment.
The investigation teams have already found some evidence to suggest that the journalist had been taken to Welikanda from the Girithale camp. But nothing concrete has been established so far. Some suspect that the journalist was killed in Welikanda. However, the CID is yet to officially declare that the journalist, who was a vociferous critique of the Rajapaksa rule, had been killed.
We already have evidence and information to take legal action against the suspect for abducting the journalist. But, we need concrete evidence to determine his fate. We need to know whether those who abducted the journalist had killed him. Then, we will take legal action against culprits for killing Eknaligoda. That is why the investigation has consumed a lot of time. We dont want to come up with a half-baked prosecution, a senior official, who is heavily involved in the investigation, told the Daily News.
The other challenge for the CID team is to identify the authority that issued orders to disappear the journalist. Nothing has been transpired so far about the person who issued the order as the suspects are keeping it as a closely guarded secret. However, the Eknaligodas family had already stated in public that a senior official, who was involved in the countrys defence establishment over the past 10 years, should be held responsible for the abduction. But, the CID investigations into the matter are solely based on evidence.
Indecisiveness on LG polls
A strong sense of indecisiveness looms large over the Local Government election scheduled for March. There is no decision so far on the electoral system that will come into effect at the Local Government election. While the President and the SLFP prefers the new electoral system, the UNP is pushing for the current system. The Elections Department has told the government that it can finalize delimitation within six months, if the government decides to conduct the Local Government election under the new electoral system.
Although the Prime Minister has said there is no reason to refrain from holding the Local Government election in March, political circles in Colombo are still not too certain about timelines of the election. However, the postponement of the election is disadvantageous for the ruling party in more ways than one. Under the present circumstances, only the UNP can be identified as the ruling party as it has a majority stake in the national unity government.
However, the Local Government election is now turning out to be a three-cornered fight with the UPFA facing a split ahead of the election.
Weerawansa and co. attempt to revive 2004 strategy
A major step in this direction was the formation of a national movement with the participation of several constituent parties of the UPFA. The prime objective of this new alliance, titled National Movement to protect the Motherland, is to oppose the governments commitment to conduct a war crimes inquiry.
A discussion in this regard was held at the Abhayaramaya, the de facto political office of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on October 9 with the participation of minor political parties of the UPFA. During the meeting, the group decided to appoint Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, Prof. Induragare Dhammarathana Thera, Dr. Medagoda Abhayathissa Thera, Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera and Fr. Sarath Hettiarachchi as the patrons of the movement.
Mahajana Eksath Peramuna Leader and UPFA Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena has been appointed as the Chairman of the movement while Prof. G. L. Peiris has been appointed as the Secretary. National Freedom Front Leader and UPFA Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa is the National Organizer of the movement.
Udaya Gammanpila has been appointed as the Cultural Affairs Secretary of the organization while Gevindu Kumaratunga serving as its Administrative Secretary. Parliamentarian Gamini Lokuge has been appointed as the Treasurer.
The National Movement to Protect the Motherland has been formed as a socio-political movement and one can easily draw parallels with this movement and the Patriotic National Movement (PNM) formed in 2003 to make way for the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). Some who were heavily involved in the affairs of the Patriotic National Movement (PNM) were behind the formation of the National Movement to Protect the Motherland.
It is important to examine the circumstances leading to the formation of the Patriotic National Movement (PNM), a front organization for the UPFA. Among the key figures involved in the formation of the movement were Ven. Elle Gunawansa Thera, Wimal Weerawansa, Mangala Samaraweera, Anura Bandaranaike and Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera. Wimal Weerawansa, at that point, was the Propaganda Secretary of the JVP while Bandaranaike and Samaraweera represented the SLFP-led Peoples Alliance.
The main objective behind the setting up of the PNM was to hinder the peace process initiated by the UNP government in December 2005. The PNM dubbed the entire peace process as a betrayal and mobilized masses against it. As Weerawansa was heavily involved in the affairs of the PNM, the JVPs the organizational strength was behind the movement and it also had the backing of a section of the SLFP.
The LTTE was at the zenith of its military power at the time of the movements formation. Although the organization was negotiating with the government, they also strengthened their military apparatus, raising serious doubts over its commitment to the peace process. The South was suspicious over the bonafides of the LTTE and there was a strong criticism that the government was soft-pedaling the LTTE matter. The PNM cashed in on the fears of the South and consolidated their position in the countrys socio-political sphere.
Twisted roles of Mangala and GL
Through public meetings, rallies and seminars, the organization stressed the need for a patriotic political alliance to counter the peace process of the UNP-led government. It laid the foundation to form the UPFA, an alliance between the SLFP, the JVP and several other political parties in the opposition. The UPFA was formed just months ahead of the Parliamentary election in 2004 and the coalition managed to defeat the UNP with a margin of nearly 20 seats. Wimal Weerawansa and Mangala Samaraweera played decisive roles behind the formation of the coalition and it was led by the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The minor parties of the UPFA are now attempting to stage the same play with some different characters, after a lapse of 12 years. Wimal Weerawansa, has chosen to play an important role in the drama like in 2004, but he does not have the same strength he had in 2004 as the Propaganda Secretary of the JVP. Dinesh Gunawardena, who played a 'supporting role' in the UPFAs formation in 2004, has become a key figure in the new national movement.
Interestingly, Mangala Samaraweera, a key player in the PNM and the UPFA in 2004, is playing a pivotal role in the countrys inquiry into war crimes allegations and international humanitarian law violations. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, now a Patron of the SLFP, is to head the governments mission for national reconciliation and she has become a staunch supporter of the war crimes inquiry. Arjuna Ranatunga, another founding member of the PNM, is currently holding an important Cabinet portfolio, under the national unity government.
In a strange twist of events, Prof. G.L. Peiris, a key member of the UNPs governments negotiation team who earned the wrath of the likes of Weerawansa, is a front-liner of the newly formed national movement. Prof. Peiris, the chief architect of former President Kumaratungas power devolution package in the mid-90s, has now reinvented himself as a staunch nationalist with Sinhala-Buddhist leanings!
On the other hand, dynamics have shifted in an unimaginable way 12 years after the UPFA's formation. The Rajapaksa government has militarily crushed the LTTE, the biggest challenge the country faced at the time of the UPFAs formation. Even the Tamil National Alliance has abandoned the idea of a separate state and its leader has been appointed as the Opposition Leader of the countrys legislature, positioning the party strongly in Sri Lankas national politics. The impact of the Rajapaksa governments military victory against the LTTE has lost its validity as the former President overplayed it for his own political gains. The ultra-nationalist campaign, which forms the ideological base of the new national government, suffered defeat at two national level elections, within a period of nine months. It is no longer a popular slogan as it used to be in 2004.
All the groups involved in the new movement are minor political parties that do not have island-wide presence. The largest political party in the movement, the NFF led by Weerawansa, has only five seats in Parliament. As stand-alone entities outside the umbrella of the UPFA coalition, they can hardly secure a seat at a national level election. In this context, it is difficult to imagine - at least at this point - that the new movement will be a prelude to a grand political coalition like the UPFA, twelve years ago.
The popular face they are trying to promote is former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. However, former President Rajapaksa, who led the UPFAs unsuccessful election campaign in August, is yet to officially associate himself with the new alliance. He will have to step out of the SLFP  the party of which he was a member for more than 45 years  to extend his support formally to the newly formed national movement. It, needless to say, will be a tough task for the former President who is now a mere Parliamentarian of the opposition.
The UNP and the SLFP, the two main political parties, are on the same page about the domestic war crimes investigation, supported by international stakeholders. Both parties have expressed clearly that the country cannot rule the need for a credible domestic mechanism that can earn the faith of the international community. This agreement will not allow the new national movement to piggyback on a mainstream political party, in its bid to gain political power.
Against this backdrop, the national movement will only ensure the political survival of the UPFA minor parties who will be left out by the SLFP in the near future. With the SLFP going solo, the minor constituents will be deprived of organizational strength to carry out an island-wide campaign when it comes to an important election. The movement against war crimes inquiry and patriotic rhetoric associated with it will be their last straw where the elections are concerned.

Iceland: Changing Climates and Cameras - On Assignment
Like it or not, weather is probably the most inconsistent constant we face in our everyday lives. That is, after all, why it's one of the first things mentioned in family catch-ups or business calls and one of the most popular categories of mobile apps. We even have television stations dedicated to telling us how dry (or wet) our weekends are going to be. For a photographer, weather becomes a separate obsessive art in and of itself-so much so that expeditions are often planned to far-off lands simply because the weather, or light, is particularly agreeable for the mood we're trying to capture. The visual feeling of a photograph is almost always directly related to the weather, so travelers we photographers often become.
Traveling is the way that I've built a career in photography, capturing the world's best outdoor and action sport athletes in the planet's most extreme landscapes. While photographing everything from spiky rock summits in Pakistan to elite runners in the sweaty, wet jungles of Brazil, I've seen a lot of wacky weather. But nowhere else in my travels have I seen the weather change so quickly and dramatically than as in Iceland.
Now, we could go on for hours about the geography, the waterfalls, and the otherworldly color palette that make Iceland stunningly beautiful, but to me it's the ever changing weather that makes Iceland a photographer's dream. Never was this more apparent than on an assignment I took to capture images along Iceland's famous Ring Road using a new point-and-shoot camera.
The goal was simple on paper: Spend a week driving the 800-mile loop around the island, and document anything and everything that happened with my point-and-shoot.
At first I was worried about leaving my trusty SLR at home (OK, I packed an "emergency" SLR in the trunk), but as we put Reykjavk in the rearview mirror, I found myself psyched to just have the small camera in my pocket and my mind free to absorb the epic beauty that Iceland is famous for. By day two, I realized that having your camera in your pocket has other distinct advantages.
Namely, if you find yourself needing to jump over a river to get the perfect shot of a passing rainbow, you're much quicker and nimbler.
Or if you come around the corner on one of Iceland's infamous F roads and there happens to be a field of Icelandic horses in a freak blizzard before you, capturing the fleeting moment is only a five-second process.
As the week wore on I realized an unexpected and bigger benefit: I was interacting with my travel companions more and tinkering with my cameras less. I was truly enjoying the adventure-in the moment, as it happened.
Free of the burden of heavy camera bags and worrying about equipment and getting "the shot," I could simply sit back and enjoy the feeling of the electric-green moss near Hfn as we lay in a brief moment of sunshine, watching the clouds fly by overhead. Or accept the challenge to fly a kite as the wind gusted to hurricane levels on the beaches in Vk.
It was liberating.
They say that if you don't like the weather in Iceland, wait five minutes. In our week traveling the Ring Road, I think we saw every type of weather imaginable: rain, snow, wind, sun, rainbows-usually all in the same day.
But with my trusty point-and-shoot in my pocket, I think I had the perfect tool for the job, always within reach and ready to capture those fleeting moments of light and weather across the epic Icelandic landscapes. National Geographic

Matale Thomians hold Antonians to a draw
Heavy rain forced an early end to the schools Under 19 cricket tournament match between St. Anthony's College, Katugastota and St. Thomas College, Matale which ended in a draw at Bernard Aluvihare Stadium, Matale yesterday.
This was a historic match of a sorts as this was the first time that these schools met at a senior cricket match perhaps in any teams sports. Thomian promotion to higher level and Antonian demotion to tower division was responsible for this.
Though conceding first innings points the Matale Thomians look major honours as they were 44 runs ahead and 9 wickets in hand when rain stopped play at 1.45 pm.
The Antonians could have found themselves in deep trouble if not for two face saving knocks by Mohamed Afler 73 (10 fours) and Suresh Jayasinghe 45 (6 fours) who together were responsible for 119 of the 167 runs scored by St. Anthony's College. Then their off spinner Kavindu Yapa Bandara took 7 for 34 in tantalising spell to restrict the Thomian. For the Matale school off spinner Dimantha Senanayake took 5 for 30.
St. Thomas College, Matale 127 all out in 45.4 overs (Pubudu Chathuranga 30, Liyanga Jayasundera 22, Kavindu Yapa Bandara 7 for 34, Pradeep Darshana 2 for 24) and 74 for one in 19 overs (Lihanga Jayasunera 34 not out, Pubudu Chathuranga 30, Kavindu Yapa Bandara 1 for 23).
St. Anthony's College 162 all out in 37 overs (Mohamed Afler 74, Suresh Jayasinghe 45, Dimantha Senanayake 5 for 30, Sashika Bandara 2 for 23).

A nagging indulgence
A Masters for creative writing Thats hardly possible, you would guess. But the reality is that creative writing is no longer a job done purely in your imaginative realm. It requires researching. Like it or not, creative writing has turned out to be a competitive industry. Madhubhashini Disanayaka Ratnayake read Creative Writing for her Masters. That aside, she finds a vociferous (possibly addictive) reader within herself. So to say, this litchat could be quite a comfort zone for her.
Q: Why do you write
A: Because that is what makes me feel most myself. Because I am angry about some things and do not know how to put things right except to put it into words. (I have this bad habit of trying to fix things!) Because - outside of my family - that is what I feel gives my life most meaning.
Q: What is your muse
A: Good books. Every time I read something breathtaking, I want to try and write something as good. Because I read some of the best writers around, I am probably never going to do that, but at least I am trying to get to some point ahead. At least a small step forward on a very very long road is better than not moving at all. Complacency is a very dangerous thing.
Q: What kind of books do you like to read most
A: Serious stuff, I guess. Something that teaches me something about life, about people, about another way of looking at things. We are very limited in our personal lives - there is only a particular range of feelings and emotions that we can go through - though admittedly that can get pretty broad sometimes too! But books give access to an unlimited number of emotions. Then you become bigger, greater. That said, I really loved the Harry Potter series too - that would probably not come under serious stuff but pure entertainment.
Q: What are your favourite books
A: Too many to list. But I will tell you some of my favourite authors - Tony Morrison, Alice Walker, Nadine Gordimer, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Jhumpa Lahiri, Magaret Atwood, Alice Munroe, Jeannette Winterson, Nadeem Aslam, Amitav Ghosh, Caryl Philips, Marquez, Ben Okri and others I have forgotten to name here. I like almost all the books that these writers have written.
Q: What have you got to tell the worst critic of yours
A: Thank you.
Q: Looking back, do you wish if you could edit your first book
A: Of course. It is actually very hard to read what you have written some time back. Very often you have to try and not cringe.
Q: What is your opinion about literary awards
A: Being human, when I get an award, I think it is good. When I dont, I think its bad. So I love the Gratiaen. And dont think much of the State Literary Award. This is said just to show how fallible and human writers can be. There is nothing objective about what we say.
Q: Out of the award-winning books and popular books, which category appeals to you most
A: Award winning, I guess. It depends very much on who the judges are - and what the award is. When I choose books at the British Council for example, when I dont know the author, I check in the cover to see if it has got any award. That is how I discover great writers I hadnt heard of, like Pat Baker for example. But then the genres such as Fantasy like Harry Potter and Detective like Agatha Christie are very appealing to me too. Those belong to the popular, I guess. Goes to show that really good writing is simply really good writing: award winning books are popular as well and vice versa.
Q: Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating
A: I read mostly when I wait for something to happen. Since I am a mother who drives children for many of their activities, I get a lot of that - possibly my vociferous reading is thanks to this fact. I read guiltlessly at those times. At home, when I read, there is this nagging feeling that there are many others things that have to be done. One of these days I will get rid of that, probably, but when the kids are young, putting your feet up and reading seems an indulgence even though my heart and brain tells me it is not.

New traffic plan has added to the chaos - Gemunu
The new traffic plan in Colombo introduced by the Police is a total failure since it has actually created more traffic congestion, Lanka Private Bus Owners Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne said.
He said the government should introduce a long term plan to tackle this problem without diverting traffic here and there.
You cannot stop people from buying new vehicles and when these too are added, road traffic deviation will not work, he added.
People in countries like Japan always use public transport and they use their cars only on weekends to attend to their private work.
We should develop our public transport system to that level, Wijeratne added. He noted that it is essential to make the shift from private to public transport to tackle the problem of congestion due to the increase in vehicles.
When the average speed decreases, it leads to longer travel times, causing economic loss as a result of high fuel consumption and rise in pollution levels.

Next LG poll under hybrid system - Mustapha
The government hopes to hold the next local government elections under the proposed Hybrid system, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha said yesterday.
Under this system, 70 percent will be elected under the wards system and 30 percent under the mixed proportionate system, the minister said.
Musthapha said a study on the delimitation of electoral boundaries has been conducted and currently the authorities were discussing on some disputed areas.
Out of the 335 local government bodies, 312 were being administered by a special commissioner after their term of office expired recently.
The term of office of some of the remaining Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas will end on October 16 and the rest on October 31. Local Government and Provincial Councils Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana said according to Act 2012 No 22, all local government elections should be under the new mixed system.
The next election should be held under the new system. The term of office of all local government bodies will expire by October 31 and the election should be held within a short period, he said. Paranavithana added that there are some critical observations by political forces about the proposed new system.
There are main criticisms against the new system. One is that the demarcation of constituencies is not transparent and not inclusive. It means that ideas of all stake holders have not been taken into consideration. he said.
The deputy minister also said that the introduction of a multi-member constituency was also a little problematic.
Some say that the principle of multi-member constituency has been violated. There really are no multi-member constituencies. There are some ethnic divisions, he said.
Paranavithana said it is widely accepted that womens quota for local bodies should be guaranteed. The accepted quota is 30 percent. But this is 0 percent. There is no guarantee for womens quota. Some suggest that we should introduce another amendment to the Act and go for the election, the deputy minister said. He said the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister also has the power to appoint another committee to look into these grievances and make his recommendations.
The minister is going to appoint a committee and take all matters into consideration. Another Cabinet sub committee has also been appointed headed by Minister Kabir Hashim to study these issues and suggest some recommendations to the Cabinet, Paranavithana said.

One novel, lasting fame
On March 30, 1820, Anna Sewell was born into a devoutly Quaker family. Her mother, Mary Wright Sewell, was a successful children's book author. Sewell was mostly educated at home and did not attend school for the first time until she was twelve years old. Two years later, she seriously injured both ankles in an accident. From then on, Sewell had extremely limited mobility; she required crutches and could never walk great distances.
Sewell resorted to using horse-drawn carriages for transportation. Soon she fell in love with horses and became deeply concerned about their humane treatment. That concern led her to undertake the children's Anna Sewell classic Black Beauty. Sewell undertook the novel not for children, but for those who cared for horses. She said her "special aim [was] to induce kindness, sympathy, and an understanding" toward equines. But when Sewell began the novel in 1871, her health was already failing. At first, she narrated the story to her mother. In 1876, Sewell began writing on small slips of paper, which her mother would then transcribe.
Sewell completed Black Beauty in 1877, only five months before she passed away. She did, however, live long enough to enjoy the book's initial success. Though Sewell finished only one novel during her lifetime, that book has survived as a wonderful literary legacy. Sewell is one of many legendary authors who managed to publish only a single novel during their lifetime.
Edgar Allan Poe
One of the earliest American authors to embrace the short story, Edgar Allan Poe was a master of suspense and horror. He's credited with originating detective fiction and contributing to the evolution of science fiction. A truly prolific author, Poe was the first American author to earn his living (paltry though it Edgar_Allan_Poe-1sometimes was) through writing. Yet he only wrote one novel: The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838). Jules Verne would later write a sequel in 1897 called An Anarctic Mystery, but also known as The Sphinx of the Ice Fields.
Emily Bront
Like her sisters, Emily Bront originally published under a more androgynous pseudonym--when Wuthering Heights was published in 1847, it bore the name of Ellis Bell.
The novel met with mixed reviews from critics, who mostly found the book unbelievable and even scandalous. In a later edition, Charlotte Bront wrote a preface to the novel, defending her sister's work. Unfortunately Emily would not survive to write another masterpiece; she died of tuberculosis only a year after Wuthering Heights was published.
Oscar Wilde
Oscar Wilde wrote plenty of plays and poetry, but The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) would be his only novel. It didn't win Wilde any friends with literary critics, who called the novel everything from "effeminate" to "unclean." Always eager to please, Wilde revised the novel but directed the rest of his energies to plays and poetry. During Wilde's lifetime, he would be best known for these, but it was Dorian Gray that earned Wilde a place in the literary canon.
Margaret Mitchell
Margaret Mitchell had never wanted to publish a novel, but then a colleage expressed doubt that Mitchell could accomplish such a feat. Gone with the Wind was published in 1936, propelling Mitchell to the exact kind of fame she had wanted to avoid. She won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1957.
Gone with the Wind has remained one of the bestselling books of all time. Mitchell, who hated being in the limelight, refused to publish another novel and had little time to reconsider--she died at age 49, after being struck by a car. Her novella Lost Laysen was published posthumously in 1996.
Ross Lockridge, Jr
Though Ross Lockridge, Jr has yet to become a household name, the author received considerable acclain for his first novel, Raintree County, published in 1948. The book is often considered a Great American Novel, placing Lockridge in the illustrious company of legendary authors like Mark Twain and Ernest Hemingway. Raintree County topped the New York Times bestseller list and was adapted for the silver screen in 1951. But it would be Lockridge's last work; he committed suicide only three months after Raintree County was published.
Ralph Ellison
When Ralph Ellison published Invisible Man in 1952, it met with almost immediate acclaim. It won the US National Book Award for Fiction in 1953. Ellison continued to write, hoping to match the success of his debut novel. But in 1967, a fire in his home destroyed Ellison's second manuscript. Ellison persevered, eventually producing a new manuscript that sprawled to over 2,000 pages. After he died, the manuscript was condensed, edited, and published as Juneteenth.
Boris Pasternak
Boris Pasternak is remembered as a titan of twentieth-century poetry. It's no wonder that his attempt at a novel would be nothing short of spectacular--yet Dr. Zhivago (1957) was almost not published at all. The manuscript had to be smuggled out of Russia and published abroad.
In 1958, Pasternak was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, and his latest novel certainly contributed to the Swedish committee's decision.
Unfortunately the Russian government disapproved of Pasternak's perspective, and he was forced to decline the Nobel Prize under threat of punishment.
John Kennedy Toole
When A Confederacy of Dunces was published in 1980, it earned author John Kennedy Toole a posthumous Pulitzer Prize.
The brilliant but troubled Toole had finished the novel much earlier. But the stress of consistent rejections from publishers wore on Toole, as did other aspects of his life.
He committed suicide in 1969. The book was published thanks to the hard work of Toole's mother and has since been recognized as an outstanding work of twentieth-century American literature.
Arundhati Roy
The God of Small Things, published in 1997, was Arundhati Roy's first major foray into fiction.
The semi-autobiographical book met with great praise; it won the Booker Prize, made Time magazine's list of the five best books of 1997, and was a New York Times notable book of the year. Though Roy has said that she's working on another novel, there's no anticipated publication date. Meanwhile, Roy has steadily published non-fiction and screenplays.

Over 65,000 applications to get 30 pc from EPF
The Labour Department has received over 65,000 applications from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) members to obtain 30 percent from their EPF accounts. The Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry allows members to withdraw 30 percent from their accounts from May, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
"I have instructed my staff to take steps to implement this at provincial level efficiently and effectively. A large number of people are coming to the Labour Department at Narahenpita daily to check the balance in their accounts. It is an inconvenience for both them and the department," he said.
"Although we have received over 65,000 applications we can grant funds for only 3,700 due to the lack of department staff. As a result, we will implement this at provincial level through the Deputy Labour Commissioner General Offices," he added.
The Labour Department has found solutions for the shortage of staff. However, it is more convenient to implement this at provincial level as members do not need to come to Narahenpita from far off areas.
Implementing this programme at provincial level will make this three times more efficient, the minister said.

PALESTRINA AND THE UPRISING OF CHURCH MUSIC
The fading period of Renaissance made a significant impact for the entry of Giovanni da Palestrina, destined to become the father of sacred and spiritual music of the church. This fusion of style and score, more of a preoccupation, was the time of reverent, lush choral works that awakened the church and so far evaded the interest of composers.
Thus began the seculiar counterparts to church music by masters of Madrigals producing contrapuntal settings of long lines on pastoral subjects.
A closer relationship between seculiar and church music was the cross-pollination that benefitted the development of both and musicians spread its concept through the Burgundian style of learning to all European composers. This development was the result of the royal patronage usurping the church as the most important in the influence of all churches, orthodox or otherwise. This took place in the middle of the fifteenth century and in 1416, Henry of England employed over thirty voices in the Chapel Royal while the Papal Chapel had only nine voices. This fascinating combination began opening its doors to composers' character in music.
Based on this background of new thinking, the stage was set for Giovanni da Palestrina's entry to the world of classical music. He was responsible for the uprising of church music; the spirituality therein that intrigued and amazed all Christian leaders who found the expression to voice what had been hidden within their souls. It was a true medium of bonding worshippers across Europe to their fold. This was in the background of sermons and preachings of priests being far below the attraction or reason for church-goers to continue their presence in prayer sessions or the bland choral singing of the day. The following two hundred years witnessed the invasion of compositions that led to the magnifying church music such as Schubert's AVE MARIA, Mozart's AVE VERNUM CORPUS and the poignant choral works written by several others. There was also the GERMAN REQUIEM scored by Brahms, Mendelssohn's ELIJAH (Rest in the Lord)' A different version of THE REQUIEM by Verdi along with Handel's HALLELUJAH chorus from the MESSAH made their powerful presence in the Church.
It was the iconic Palestrina that excelled in MASS, the elaborate choral setting of the principal ritual of the Roman Catholic Church. It was originally set for unaccompanied chorus like Palestrina's MISSA PAPAE MARCELLI which was an excellent example but later turned to solo, chorus and orchestra. The setting of the ordinary MASS was initiated by Palestrina himself.
Palestrina never related but went on to create extraordinary motets best known as church chorale compositions and set them to Bible text, usually found in Latin. They rested in elabrorate contrapuntal style and meant for three of four voices and unaccompanied. The important aspect of motet as Palestrina tried hard to reveal was that the counterpart of the secular madrigal and the Roman Catholic Church was equalant to the English Anthem.
Giovanni da Palestrina commenced his illustrious musical career as a boy chorister in Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome and his first job as an organist at the Julian Chapel while being married with two sons. After dedicating a book of messes containing over a hundred for which Pope Julian III, he was rewarded with the place in the papal choire without the usual audition that caused a stir among his fellow choristers who noted that he did not have a good singing voice. Palestrina was dismissed on the grounds he was a married man by the new Pope, Paul V.
Palestrina who was determine to continue at the Vatican marked his time until a new Pope was named. Till then he was involved in a string of appointments with an offer from the Emporer Maximillan to be the maestro at the Royal Court in Vienna on an exorbitant fee. In no time Palestrina found his dream come true. He was appointed as maestro under the new Pope, Gregory XIII at the Julian Chapel until he died. When his wife and two sons died from the Plague and in desperation, he took decision of entering priesthood but was persuaded otherwise by a wealthy widow of a furrier combining music with real estate management. Palestrina realising he was no innovator other than in music, found himself tempted by the offer and in no time, prospered.
However, he devoted himself to meditation and studied religion as he began writng music for the Church in spiritual purity. Berlioz was one of his severe critics especially on his madrigals that are known as medieval lyrical poems but found nothing in contrapuntal style, generally designed for voices. The counterpart of the liturgical motet was not found in his madrigal and Berlioze further pointed out but acknowledged him as a writer of pure beauty sounds and could not write any other music. Yet, we find forceful expressions in his music that includes 250 motets, 60 sacred, 100 secular madrigals along with lamentations, psalms, litenies and masses.
He is universally accepted as the greatest composer of the Catholic Church and one of the finest masters of classical polyphonic writing. The Vatican used him during the Counter-Reformation when the Church was doing all it could to strike back at the Protestant Movement that called for music to avoid elaborate contrapuntal setting that tended to obscure the words. Palestrina knew exactly what the Vatica wanted which was an ethereal cloud of sound to fill St. Peter's this he achieved and perhaps rewarded because is it here that he was buried with his coffin displaying the epitaph MUSICAE PRINCEPS.

Governor Tales
Sir Herbert Stanley 1927-1931
by Bassano, vintage print, 1937
Now we are gradually coming on to the threshold of Sri Lankan independence while the governors themselves fashioned their acts accordingly. For example Sir Stanley was responsible for the preliminary work regarding the bringing down of the throne and crown of our kings from England to which land they were taken after the capture of Kandy.
Why the removal To rid the island of insignia that could provoke rebellion. The crown and throne were actually brought back to the island by the duke and duchess of Gloucester during a subsequent governorship.
Anyway back to Stanley's bio data. Born in July 1872, Eton and Oxford educated, he soon got interested in the colonial empire mostly in South Africa. First he acted there as private secretary of the first governor general, Gladstone. Then he was promoted to imperial secretary and in 1927 was appointed governor of Ceylon at the late age of 52.
If Stanley had made a name for himself by this time, in varied capacities, one was that he was married to the most beautiful woman in the world (Hulugalle).
Coming back to more prosaic stuff, by this time the report of the Donoughmore commission had been presented to the British parliament. Back at home it got subject to much debate and discussion in the legislative council, especially the matter of the grant of universal suffrage. Especially arose the issue of considering the grant of universal suffrage, all and sundry, even to the newly come estate Indian population. The abolition of communal representation too raised much igniting matter.
Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, the leader of the unofficial members in the LC was one who opposed the matter of universal suffrage, vehemently arguing that it would lead o socialistic legislation. He also argued, maybe be correctly that educational advance should precede general enfranchisement.
Despite much opposition of taking away the main university away from Colombo, opposed even by some of the most powerful, it was in Stanley's tenure that the legislative council (LC) passed a motion for the establishment of a university in Kandy in March 1928. The opposition to this project was triggered by the concept that all major establishments should be in the capital. However the project went ahead.
A few months later the report of the Donoughmore commission was published while a new chamber was attached to this all important council that was steering the country's politics for a number of years.
These following events that were shared by the governorships of Sir Clifford and Stanley in 1927 should also be mentioned.
Steps being taken for the electrification of the island. With this end in view in March 1929 an electric power station in Kolonnawa opened. No doubt the island was on its way to getting electrified totally.
But Governor Stanley's heart was in South Africa just as governor Gregory" s heart was in Lanka. In 1931 he returned there as high commissioner for UK and later became governor of Southern Rhodesia and later settled down in Cape Town. He died at age of 82 years in 1955, well into our times. So he was one who passed the 70 limit.

Sisters orphaned decades ago in South Korea reunite by chance in US
US: Two orphaned sisters separated decades ago in Korea have been reunited after miraculously getting hired on the same floor of a southwest Florida hospital.
Holly Hoyle O'Brien was adopted by an American couple in 1978 when she was 9-years-old after. A few years earlier, her biological father had wandered into the path of a speeding train and she was forced to identify his body. After that, she went to live in an orphanage in South Korea. Her stepmother had taken her younger half-sister years earlier and left. It's unclear where the two went.
O'Brien grew up in a happy home in Alexandria, Virginia, with three sisters and six brothers. Still, something was missing. One night she woke up in tears, telling her parents, "my daddy died, I have a sister, we need to find her."
Her adoptive mother contacted the orphanage but they had no record of a biological sister.
"But in my heart, I knew," said O'Brien, now 46. "I knew she was out there somewhere."
Her sister, Meagan Hughes, barely remembers her mother or the Korean orphanage where she eventually ended up. She was also adopted by an American family and grew up in Kingston, New York, about 300 miles from where her sister lived in Virginia.
Earlier this year, O'Brien was hired at Bayfront Health Port Charlotte, working on the fourth floor with the medical surgical unit. Two months later, Hughes, who had been working as a physical therapy assistant, was hired.
"One of the patients told me there was another nurse, named Meagan, who was from Korea. She said you should talk to her, maybe you're from the same town," said O'Brien.
The Sarasota Herald-Tribune (tinyurl.com/okwhrvz) reports the two instantly connected and soon the similarities started adding up. - JAPAN TIMES

SL vulnerable to drug traffickers - Ruwan
Sri Lankan Security Forces including the coastguard are continuously engaged in protecting the country from the drug menace since the country is vulnerable to drug traffickers due to its location, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.
Security Forces have confiscated a significant amount of drugs, the minister said at the international meeting of senior drug enforcement officials of the Indian Ocean region at the Taj Samudra Hotel, Colombo yesterday.
The meeting was jointly organised by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Global Maritime Crime Programme and the Defence Ministry. Wijewardene said Sri Lanka was maintaining a cordial and close rapport with other countries and organisations which are engaged in fighting the drug menace in the international arena. "Sri Lanka is in the centre of the Indian Ocean and therefore the country is easily affected by the drug menace," Minister Wijewardene said.

Special licence for passenger transport drivers
The Department of the Commissioner of Motor Traffic (DMT) has commenced issuing a special licence to drivers transport passengers buses with the intention of safeguarding commuters and pedestrians rights.
Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said it will be compulsory to obtain the special licence for drivers working in passenger transporting vehicles including CTB and private buses, motor coaches as well as staff and school vans in the future.
The drivers are expected to undergo a 14 day training programme and should pass the compulsory examination following the two day practical test to become eligible for the new licence. The training programme will provide an awareness of first aid, technical know how and ethics and values a driver should processes, he said.
Qualified drivers who pass writing and practical tests will be given the special certificate after the payment of Rs. 2,000 to the DMT. In the future, when they renew their licence from the DMT, a special licence under the category of Passenger Transport (PT) will be given to drivers, de Silva said.
According to statistics, there are around 40,000 passenger transport drivers in the country. Around 500 drivers have already undergone the training programme.
The third stage of the training programme was conducted under the patronage of Minister de Silva yesterday.
Around 100 drivers of passenger transport buses are undergoing the training programme.
The minister addressing a gathering said it is the responsibility of the Transport Ministry to regain the respect lost by passenger transport bus drivers.

Sri Lanka faces test before Test
While Sri Lanka will be looking to salvage some of its lost prestige after losing back to back Test series against Pakistan and India, the West Indies is in search of their elusive Test victory formula in the island which they have found hard to attain. The West Indies has never won a Test match in Sri Lanka.
The two sides meet in the first Test at the Galle International Cricket Stadium today.
But the Sri Lankans also cannot hide the fact that picking the final eleven has caused them the biggest headache following the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara, the lost case of Jehan Mubarak, the poor form of Upul Tharanga (both dropped), the injury to fast bowler Shaminda Eranga, the banning of Tharindu Kaushal's so-called 'doosra' and the non selection of off-spinner Suraj Randiv who plucked five wickets in a side match against the West Indies, which have all contributed to the uncertainty.
The only aspect that Sri Lanka can look forward to with some form of positivenes is that the series is on home turf and the West Indies are currently not the strongest of teams.
The preparation for both sides has also been hampered by rain, but at the same time are confident that they had adequate exposure prior to the all important Test and trying out the new faces for the right combination will be another test.
Sri Lanka in particular has been quite successful in discovering a couple of players who no doubt can be an asset for the future. One such player is left-hander Milinda Siriwardena who has proved his class beyond doubt.
West Indies captainJason Holder
Sirwardene who has made many tours with the Sri Lanka 'A' team has finally given the selectors a stern reminder by scoring a century against the tourists in the concluded three-day game. Siriwardena also gave out an impressive display in the ODI series against Pakistan.
Minodh Bhanuka is the other player who went on to score a century in the three-day game at the SSC ground.
The experienced duo of Dhammika Prasad and Nuwan Pradeep will share the new ball for Sri Lanka. Veteran Rangana Herath who bowled Sri Lanka to victory against India at Galle in the First Test will spearhead the Sri Lankan spin attack and is likely to be supported by young off spinner Tharindu Kaushal. Kusal Perera will bat at number seven strengthening the lower middle order.
The Teams:
Sri Lanka (from): Angelo Mathews (Captain), Lahiru Thirimanne (V. Captain), Kaushal Silva, Dimuth Karunaratne, Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera, Milinda Siriwardena, Kusal Mendis, Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera, Tharindu Kaushal, Dhammika Prasad, Nuwan Pradeep, Suranga Lakmal, Dushmantha Chameera,
West Indies (from): Jason Holder (Captain), Carlos Braithwaite, Jerome Taylor, Shannon Gabriel, Kemer Roach, Andrea Coley, Devendra Bishoo, Jermaine Blackwood, Kraigg Braithwaite (V.Captain), Darren Bravo, Rajendra Chandrika, Shane Dowrich', Shai Hope, Denesh Ramdin, Marlon Samuels, Jomel Warrica.

Sri Lanka: sea, sand and surf
I blame Bethany Hamilton. Repeat viewings of "Soul Surfer," the 2011 movie about the young surfer in Hawaii who lost an arm to a tiger shark only to return to competition, have left my two young children fearless in the ocean and enthralled with the sport.
So, with air miles to spare and vacation time to burn, my wife, two offspring and I made for Sri Lanka.
Best known for its tea and tradition, the island once called Ceylon has quietly become a destination on the Asian surfing scene alongside the better-known breaks of Bali and the Maldives - although its surf spots are definitely grittier and lower key.
On the country's east coast, generally avoided for a quarter century during the brutal, 26-year civil war, the surf scene has not moved far beyond the time, decades ago, when the first Western surfers wandered off the beach in search of fresh water and some plumbing.
Greeted
The country confounded our expectations from the beginning.
The A.T.M. machine greeted us out loud and, for some reason, with a light Scottish burr: "Please input your secret code" and then, "What would you like to do"
What we wanted to do, after stocking up on rupees, was head quickly away from the southwest monsoon that sweeps the west coast of Sri Lanka in summer. Our destination was Arugam Bay. The east coast village, entirely dry in summer months, is the country's surfing capital from April to October. Once the seasonal waves vanish, it reverts to its historic role as a tuna-fishing port.
Jordan Griffin, a sometime member of the New Zealand surf team and a barista, comes to Sri Lanka when his visa in Bali runs out. He calls Arugam Bay "one of the best spots in the world, maybe not for high-performance surfing but for long boards."
The long rides, the relative lack of surfers and the sense of uncovering a new frontier make it worth the trip, he added.
"If I wanted strong waves, I would go to Western Australia. But that's not really my gig," he said. "This is Bali 20 years ago. It is a pretty special place to surf."
As complete newbies to surfing, mellow sounded good. We decided to spend a week in "A-Bay" at the end of July, and another in the south coast town of Weligama. Its sheltered, mile-wide bay also offers excellent conditions for beginners and, although the area catches some of the west's wet weather, it can be surfed year-round.
For a relatively small island of 25,330 square miles, not quite the size of Ireland, Sri Lanka has a remarkably diverse climate. We landed in Colombo, the lush, tropical capital.
A 230-mile drive that took seven hours - on these roads, the largest vehicles have the right of way - took us right across the island to Arugam Bay. With its acacia trees and lion-gold grass, the bay area looks more like the South African bushveld than a tropical island. Peacocks wander the parched rice paddies just outside of town, and the sea breeze, once inland, blows hot and dry.
Restaurants
Arugam Bay is a one-road village lined with roti restaurants touting the national dish, rice and curry - a spread of dal, popadums and meat and vegetable curries that belies the generic name. It also is home to some two dozen shop fronts, really little more than concrete shells, where you can buy T-shirts or rent surfboards for about 500 rupees, or about $3.50, an hour.
About 2,500 rupees will get you an hour with a personal instructor who works on technique - and gives your board an extra push when he shouts "Get up!" Another 1,000 rupees will pay for a tuk tuk driver, who will wait for you during your lesson.
We sought out Krishantha Ariyasena, chairman of the Arugam Bay Surf Club, a loose-knit group of instructors who try to coordinate a business that, in practice, is run by the seat of its board shorts.
Ariyasena, known to everyone as Krish, is one of three Sri Lankans who has qualified as an instructor through the International Surfing Association. We took about 10 lessons - dividing our time among Krish, other club instructors including Chanu Anjana, and teachers from the Amigo Surf School, overseen by Johnson Ratnasingam - before attempting to catch our first solo waves.
First, there was a brief tour around the board - "rails" for sides, "fins" on the underside - and some beach practice. The main technique is the "chicken leg" maneuver: As the wave nears you, lying on the board and with your head up, you bend your weaker leg until its heel touches your other knee. Then, as the wave picks up speed, you jump up onto both feet with your stronger leg (or, as the instructors explain, your right leg if you are "regular" and your left if you are "goofy") to the back of the board. That learned, we hit the water.
At this point in the story, you probably expect me to say that my children, who are in primary school, picked up surfing far faster than I did. And that is exactly what happened.
A beginner's soft-top surf board, which is eight -feet, eight inches long, is like a raft to a young child, so Verity, 9, and Max, 6, were standing up and riding waves almost immediately.
On the other hand, I am a 44-year-old who weighs in at 185 pounds on a good day. My knees were scraped raw as I struggled just to get my balance on the board. But, by the end of my first lesson, I was able to spend at least a few seconds on my feet before falling back into the waves.
Besides beginners, who can learn while surfing waves that break easily on the beach itself, Sri Lanka draws long boarders and surfers who hang five, take waves while doing handstands and enjoy very long rides. The biggest and best surf spot, the Point, is within walking distance of Arugam's village; other sites are just short drives.
Anusanth "Babu" Anthrasa, an Amigo Surf School instructor, said his longest ride at the Point was 70 seconds, "riding up to the lip and turning all the way along."
Locals say Pottuvil Point, a 15-minute tuk tuk ride from Arugam Bay, is the longest surf break in the country, more than 1,000 feet on a good day and about a minute-long ride. "But your legs would be jelly" from the exertion, Anthrasa added.
A-Bay, where you can count the two-story buildings on one hand, has not been spared development by choice. The country's lengthy civil war cut access to the east and north of the country, home to the Tiger rebels. Even locals struggled to make what was then at least an 11-hour trip from Colombo. Sharon Atapattu Tissera, who runs the Hideaway resort in her former vacation home, said the place was abandoned for much of the time between the onset of hostilities in 1983 and the end of the war in 2009.
"There used to be 25 to 30 checkpoints to come here," Tissera said. "We had to dodge parts of the road that were blown up by landmines."
Important
Perhaps one of the most important events that led to the end of the conflict was the 2004 tsunami that swept the eastern shores of Sri Lanka on December 26, killing 375 people in Arugam Bay alone. "Whole families got decimated," Tissera said. "They know adversity."
The region is still recovering, but for now retains its small-town charm, with wild elephants occasionally coming to drink at the lagoon, and langur monkeys and macaques roaming in the forests.
"The best thing about this place is it's so wild and raw and undeveloped," Tissera said. "Even if it's a bit selfish, I feel really, really grateful."
Jake Mackenzie, a Hong Kong native who runs Drifter Surf Shop in Bali, has brought his family to Arugam Bay for a vacation four of the last five years. Mackenzie rents his own tuk and takes off at 4 a.m. for Okanda, a spot with a tubing surf break near the entrance to Kumana National Park - literally the end of the road.
Okanda "is very raw, there's nothing there, no shade," Mackenzie said, but he noted that the tube is perfect for more-experienced young surfers. "To be honest, I'm spoiled when it comes to waves, living in Indonesia. If I want to crank it, I do it there. But I come here because it's great for the kids, and because of the people."
Surf lesson
Given its trading past, eastern Sri Lanka has evolved into a blend of populations. En route to one surf lesson, our tuk tuk contained a Christian Tamil surf coach, his Buddhist assistant and this foreigner, all being driven by a Muslim. Still, it was Australians who first discovered the waves in Sri Lanka and started to surf there regularly. Jaya Dissa, a tuk tuk driver, recalls his amazement when he saw his first "white guys," back in 1971. As a 10-year-old, he tagged along wherever they went. The local boys used to bodysurf, and the fishermen knew all the breaks. But they hadn't seen surfboards before. "I used to give them coconuts, whatever I can find, and then ask to have a ride on their board," Dissa, now 54, said. He became one of the best local surfers, but he left during the war, returning home only three years ago. "Now I don't have the lungs or power for it."Surfing in Sri Lanka is surprisingly seasonal. The monsoons bring rain to one side of the island while the other is dry. The resulting tides shift the sand throughout the year, so what once was a surf break gets washed away, only for the sand bank to build back up the following season.
Most of the Arugam Bay surf instructors teach for only half the year. The rest of the time they revert to catching tuna.
They may make more money fishing with their fathers, but to a man (and in a culturally conservative country, the surf coaches still are all men) they say they vastly prefer teaching newbies. "I'm making friends, that's what I love about surfing," Anthrasa, the Amigo instructor, said. "I love my job, and I'm having the most fun ever."
By the end of our trip we could, more or less, catch our own waves. Max decided he could dedicate his life to the sport. He wanted to put in a call to our relatives.
"Let's tell them we are going to stay and live here forever," he said, "and then we can come and play on the beach every day."

From Symbian to Android: A mother's leap of faith
What happens when a person who is used to an old Nokia phone gets a brand new Moto E Here's what Manu Shankar/Rediff.com realised when he gave one such phone to his mother
In the world when mobile phones and its technologies are changing at the rate of knots, there are still some, who haven't quite made the switch to the Andriod world from the Symbian age.
While it's hard to imagine someone not carrying a smartphone in their pocket, few are still coming to the terms with the world of Andriod.
So when I asked my mother to get rid of her Nokia E71 for good, she was a bit skeptical. After all she was comfortable with the keypad and didn't quite like the idea of touchpad or sliding her fingers through.
When I gave her Moto E second generation, she was reluctant to take it but had to since her Symbian phone had reached its saturation point.
The good thing about Symbian phones is that it's pretty simple. With Andriod, it's completely the opposite for a first time user.
So from the Gingerbreads to Jellybeans to Lollypops to KitKats -- all these mumbo jumbos sounded more like aliens compared to the simple phonebook, messages and basic e-mail. "Why would they give such chocolatey names. Why don't they make something simpler for our generation," she cribbed.
So everytime I tried to sit with her and explain how to operate the phone, she would often tell me, "Please explain it to me in layman's language."
I would often tell her not to go into the intricacies of it at the most if she won't understand and she could do a lot more with a smartphone.
So when she started exploring Moto E, she found out that it is relatively simpler yet power-packed phone. Its weight, camera and battery were the three big elements that caught her eye.
While I've seen the days where mobile phones have evolved from VGAs to multiple pixels, for her this was the first phone that gave crystal clear pictures. So the 5 MP camera is constantly on the run and she is quite happy to snap away photos and videos at every occasion.
The world seems all too colourful and power of Play Store seems to have opened a whole array of options for her.
She could not only surf the Internet, but social networking sites too were now accessible to her at the click of a button. Gone are the days of dull looking Symbian to more vibrant Andriod, where the power of customisaion takes you over.
Bit of research over the net and now she fully understands the difference and proudly says, "I've a mini computer in my hands, which takes care of my office as well as my personal needs".

He's the street artist they call the 'French Banksy', his provocative, epic murals appearing overnight, as if from nowhere. From the Paris banlieues where he grew up to New York and Shanghai, JR has a mission - to make us see those we have made invisible
Little more than 10 years ago, the Parisian photographer JR was what's usually called a vandal. He pasted things illegally in the street. Did you have a revelation at some stage, I ask him, when you thought, "Ah, this is art"
"No. At the time, there was not street art," he says. "There was no Banksy. It's not the kind of thing you said you wanted to be when you're older."
What A criminal
"Exactly."
JR still pastes things in the street; it's just that the things have got bigger. And the world has an expanded idea of what's vandalism and what's art. JR's canvases are now tower blocks, whole buildings, entire streets. His scale is epic, monumental. He turned the separation wall between Israel and Palestine into a giant gallery of faces - Palestinians on the Israeli side, Israelis on the Palestinian side, though no one could tell. He transformed a huge favela in Brazil into a vast artwork in which he literally gave the town eyes, and he displayed a pregnant refugee on the point of giving birth on half a mile of the Seine embankment in the solidly bourgeois Ile Saint-Louis.
He's usually described as a street artist and given that he's from Paris, and started out spray-painting walls and has the semi-anonymity of those two initials (his real name has never been made public), "the French Banksy" is a description that tends to follow him around. But whereas Banksy is furtive, stealthy, inward, JR couldn't be more expansive. He works with a large team of people across two continents, collaborates constantly, and communicates - via Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and the walls of dozens of cities around the world - relentlessly.
He has a knack for making the invisible - people, usually, the poor, the marginalised, the forgotten - visible. It's a sort of magic trick, I realise, making people appear, making us take notice, although it's David Blaine, the American street magician, who is actually the one who points this out to me. Blaine is known for his feats of endurance that exist somewhere at the edge of art and magic and madness - he once spent 44 days in a Plexiglass box suspended above the Thames - and he's a friend of JR's.
"JR sees things from a different perspective," Blaine tells me. "He pasted this figure of a person, hundreds of metres long, on the sidewalk at Fifth Avenue and Madison and everybody was walking over it and nobody saw it until it was photographed from above. It was completely invisible but suddenly seen by everyone. The way he's using his art has made me think about magic in a very deep and personal way." When I meet JR, it's just a few weeks since Europe's refugee crisis has finally hit the top of the political agenda propelled by the heartbreaking image of a small dead boy on a beach. And it strikes me that it's a real-life example of exactly what JR has spent the past 10 years trying to do. It's all about trying to get people to take notice of the people we spend most of our lives failing to see, or maybe, more accurately, trying to avoid seeing. JR's work has been to find a strange angle or a previously hidden corner and bring them to us. He shows us them at massive scale, or across landscapes, or just in some new or surprising or beautiful way we weren't expecting.
JR used to be one of those people.
A banlieue kid. Half Arab - his father is Tunisian - he grew up on the wrong side of the Priphrique, the ring-road that separates the bourgeois quartiers of central Paris from the places where it houses its large immigrant population: in huge concrete cits or public housing projects. It was in one of these, Les Bosquets, that JR came to take photographs 12 years ago and set in train the sequence of events that's led him to where he is today.
It was in the same suburb that the riots kicked off exactly a decade ago, the riots that swept through the banlieues and then the rest of France over a period of weeks and saw running battles with the police and more than 10,000 vehicles destroyed.
And when I meet him, he's back in the neighbourhood with a film called Les Bosquets. Even by JR's standards, the project is a stretch. As a concept, it's bordering on hallucinatory: a classical ballet performed in a housing estate reimagining the events of the 2005 riots. It's just 17 minutes long and, in the blasted concrete wastelands, mixes first-hand video footage of the riots with ballet and modern street dance he has choreographed himself. -The Guardian

Turkey feels blowback from surge of terror in its neighbours
TURKEY: In the deadly terrorist attack that claimed the lives of 95 people on Saturday in the Turkish capital, analysts see the effect of the fallout from surge of violence and terrorism in Syria and Iraq, both neighbours to Turkey.
"What we see is a spillover impact of the ongoing conflicts in our neighbouring countries in the southeast where militants of all sorts of terror groups wreak a havoc," Mehmet Seyfettin Erol, professor of international relations at Ankara-based Gazi University, told Xinhua.
"The terror that has been taking a huge toll on civilians in Syria and Iraq is now overflowing to Turkey," he said.
The attack that killed 95 Turkish civilians, according to official figures as of Sunday, and injured 246 was the work of suicide bombers who blew themselves up in the midst of a crowd that were about to hold a major peace rally in downtown area near Central Train Station in Ankara.
Although the interim Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu listed several terrorist groups as possible culprits on Saturday, local media reported that investigators are now focusing more on the Islamic State (IS) as the key suspect.
Yunus Emre Alagoz, the missing brother of Abdurrahman Alagoz who is believed to be the suicide bomber behind the attack in July in the southeastern town Suruc of Sanliurfa province that claimed the lives of 34 people, was named as a suspect.
Both brothers reportedly joined the IS in 2014. Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (MIT) former deputy head Cevat Ones said the attack is almost certainly linked to radical Islamist groups operating in the Middle East.
The timing and motivation of the attacks are also in the minds of analysts who are trying to make sense of what happened in the deadliest terrorist attack in the Turkish history.
"We have to ask ourselves why the IS attacked Turkey and why now," Idris Gursoy, Ankara-based political analyst, said in his comments to Xinhua.
"There may be some groups, home and abroad, that want to influence voters' behaviour when there are only three weeks left to the snap poll," he explained.
Turkey is heading to repeat elections on Nov. 1 after major political parties failed to form a coalition government in the aftermath of the inconclusive June elections.
Many of those who joined the peace rally in Ankara on Saturday are affiliated with the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democracy Party (HDP).

US underwater de-mining assistance improves safety
The US Navy recently concluded a two-week training session in Trincomalee to equip and support Sri Lanka's underwater de-mining efforts.
Working with scan sonars and robots donated by the US Navy, the Sri Lankan Navy enhanced its ability to search, locate, and provide information on any unknown items underwater, including unexploded ordnance from the conflict in Trincomalee Harbor.
"The United States is committed to aiding de-mining efforts across Sri Lanka, whether on land or at sea," said U.S. Ambassador Atul Keshap.
"By removing these remnants of war, we are helping ensure Sri Lankans can live and work more safely. This effort also increases the ability for the port of Trincomalee to expand its commercial operations," he said.
This recent exercise is part of continuing US assistance for de-mining efforts across the country, totaling over $43 million since 1993.
In his October 8 meeting with Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminathan, Ambassador Keshap announced an additional $1.745 million in support of de-mining activities in Sri Lanka.
US assistance to Sri Lanka's de-mining efforts have also included the transfer of safety and field equipment, surveys on mine contamination for detection and land release, and mine-clearing operations.
The United States is also leading efforts to boost Sri Lanka's own de-mining capacity through training for mine disposal units in the Sri Lankan military, including the Mine Detection Dog and underwater de-mining programmes.
"It was an honor to work with such a dedicated group of guys [in the Sri Lankan Navy]," said Leading Petty Officer Juan Hernandez. "Sharing my knowledge of these systems and seeing how receptive the divers have been has truly been a rewarding experience."

Video conferencing for health sector
Arrangements are being made to develop facilities such as video conferencing in the health sector to avoid unnecessary costs and time wastage, Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said.
He said carrying out the same set of blood tests repeatedly when obtaining medical treatment from different doctors can be avoided with the development of ICT in the health sector.
"We are also in the process of connecting 3,500 state institutions establishing a network. We will also implement the concept 'Distributing one million tabs among people'. We will distribute them for a very nominal fee. Funds will be allocated from this budget to develop digital infrastructure," Fernando said addressing the inauguration ceremony of EHealth Asia 2015 in Colombo yesterday.
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said there is a 400 percent increase in allocations to be made for the education sector from the 2016 budget while there is a 75 percent increase in the allocations for the higher education sector from the 2016 budget.
He said within a year, more freedom will be granted to state universities to function independently.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said the ministry has set up a National eHealth Steering Committee supported by WHO.
"Under the guidance of this committee, we have established National eHealth Guidelines and standards have been drafted. A unique and specialised workforce has been established to manage health information management," he said.
Prof. Sandeep Sahay from Oslo University and Asia eHealth Information Network President Dr. Alvin Marcello also spoke.

## Title: Why Angus Deaton deserved the Nobel Prize in Economics

Why Angus Deaton deserved the Nobel Prize in Economics
Every year, theres a Monday in October when the world wakes up to the latest Nobel Prize winner in economics and collectively wonders: Who
Even economists like me often have to scramble to figure out who the winners are and what they did, knowing my mom or a neighbour will expect me to have an intelligent answer at some point this week. For me, at least, this year is different than most, since the winner, Angus Deaton of Princeton University, is such a towering figure in my field of international development. This is a prize for advances in our understanding of poverty and inequality. It couldnt be better deserved.
Id never met Deaton in person until a couple of weeks ago, when he presented a paper at a small development economics seminar at Columbia University, where I work. (In retrospect, that might well have been his last normal, intimate academic talk. Ever.) But like many development economists, I can point to more than one time in my career where Deatons thinking had great influence. Speaking from personal experience, three times stand out, and all help to illustrate the work that got him the Nobel.
The first was almost 15 years ago. I was a masters student at Harvard, more interested in economic history than anything else, when my econometrics professor, Rob Jensen, hired me to spend the summer in India to run a household survey  a questionnaire on every family members work activities, earnings, health, education, and what food and items they consumed. I didnt know the first thing about household surveys, and so I bought a couple of books to bring with me.
One was Deatons Analysis of Household Surveys, a technical manual on analyzing poverty data.
The other was Deatons hefty 3-volume manual on Designing Household Surveys, written with Margaret Grosh, which weighed probably 20 pounds in reality (and 50 in my memory). I needed a separate suitcase to bring them all to India. Its only when I arrived I realized that Volume 1 held a CD on the back page with the full text of the books. Even so, I couldnt bring myself to give away these paper treasures, and carted the heavy bastards around the country for four months.
Deatons books contained the models for every measure of economic well-being the profession possessed. At the time, I took for granted they existed, and it never once occurred how hard they were to invent and get people to use.
As we walked to the office today, my colleague Suresh Naidu put it nicely. Before there were evaluations of anti-poverty programs, or analysis of inequality trends, or really most of empirical development economics, there had to be something more fundamental: measurement.
We had to know how to assess poverty, and we needed to have large-scale data to do so, to challenge our assumptions, and provide new answers. And Deaton as much or more than anyone else made this happen. Deaton helped bring about this data and measurement revolution in several ways. One was to help establish expenditures and consumption as the best of a bunch of bad measures of poverty. Annual income works fine in a country like the United States where most people earn a regular salary from one source, but its meaningless when a household has dozens of small activities, varying day to day, most of which produce things the family consumes themselves. The other contributions were to show just how much we could pull out of these simple data, and (as impressively) to actually measure it in huge household surveys  in countries that had never had that kind of data before.
We take for granted today that there are repeated health surveys of Uganda, or consumption data going back dozens of years in Cote dIvoire. But there was a time not that long ago when all of this had to be conceived and invented. Dozens of important people and organizations pushed this ahead. Deaton was one of the leading lights.
Most of us also know Deaton for some other big contribution. In my case, this was his work on commodity prices and how their fluctuations tormented developing country economies in the 1970s and 1980s. This was my second intellectual encounter with Deaton, when as a first-year Ph.D. student I started asking whether sudden shocks to oil or coffee or other commodity prices could send a country into political chaos as well. Of course, Deaton had beaten me to it.
Sudden falls in coffee and oil prices destroyed poor countries in the 1970s and 1980s, especially in Africa. Deaton had done some of the best work, both on the behavior of commodity prices, their effects on growth, and also on the reasons they caused macroeconomic chaos.
He also peeked into what the effect was on coups and political instability. In later years, hundreds upon hundreds of scholars would start using data from many countries to analyze why wars and coups happen. Deaton was one of the very first.
Deaton didnt win the Nobel for this commodity or political instability research. But its a nice example of why the Nobel committee chose him out of all the data and consumption revolutionaries: his interests were so wide and his contributions so influential, in so many big questions of development.
His idle afterthoughts helped start huge literatures, like the cross-country study of coups and wars, often years before others caught on. Twenty years after his first paper on commodity prices and political stability, I wrote what I think is a much more comprehensive and definitive paper. But its much easier to try to finish a debate than ignite and inspire one.
The third influence Deaton has had on me is much more recent: his critiques of randomized trials in development. In developed countries, scientists and governments often test the effectiveness of new pills or new employment programs by comparing a treatment group to a control group, where the people who get the treatment are drawn randomly by lottery.
Until recently, these randomized trials were almost unknown in poor countries. Billions of aid dollars were going into untested programs with untested assumptions. Proponents of randomized program evaluation  the so-called randomistas  argued more field experiments were needed to learn what worked. Deaton pushed back hard.
If youre a below the age of 30 in the world of international development and have heard of Deaton, its probably for this controversy. Today, about half my work has used some kind of field experiment  such as what happens to poverty when the poorest people get cold, hard cash instead of food or skills training  so obviously I paid attention when an intellectual hero took aim at the method.
I think the early arguments between Deaton and the randomistas involved more bluster than substance, on all sides. Randomistas called their trials the gold standard of evidence. Deaton called this misleading. But what seemed like an attack on randomized trials was more subtle  it was Deatons plea for modesty in what randomized trials can tell us.
Two weeks ago, he came to Columbia and presented a new paper on the use and misuse of randomized trials. Its a more balanced and evolved piece after, I presume, many years of debate. It was my favorite presentation of the year at Columbia. I hope with the Nobel he will still have time to get it public soon (though I fear not).
The basic idea is this: as development agencies and scholars have rushed to do more randomized trials, theyve overstated what those trials can tell us. The smartest randomistas of the movement know the limitations of experiments, but are happy to let the policy worlds enthusiasm get feverish, since good evidence is long overdue. But Deaton fears the average policymaker might take the results too seriously.
Sitting in my office a couple of weeks ago, he told me a story about the day he and his fellow economists started running regressions for the first time. It seemed like a magic tool to give all answers. And indeed it vastly increased our knowledge.
But many decades later, we recognize that most regressions are misleading, and know what to look for in good analysis. We teach regressions like a disease, one where we must find the cures for all its ailments. He wants us to think of randomized trials the same way: better than what we had before, but still profoundly diseased and in need of a lot of care and attention before we believe any of the analysis it produces. I will not preempt his paper with his unpublished arguments and prescriptions, but (as usual) I think hes right.
All in all, this is a great decision from the committee from the perspective of caring about poverty, inequality, and getting the evidence right. - www.foreignpolicy.com

Youyou Tu: how Mao's challenge led her to Nobel prize
It was 21 January 1969 when Mao Zedong gave a 39-year-old scientist from Zhejiang province the challenge of her life.
China was in the grip of the Cultural Revolution, with universities and schools across the country shutting their doors as the red guards ran riot.
Amid all the madness Youyou Tu, then a researcher at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine in Beijing, was handed a daunting mission: to find a drug that would cure malaria.

"The work was the top priority so I was certainly willing to sacrifice my personal life," the famously understated scientist later recalled.
On Monday, nearly half a century after her life-changing quest began, Tu was awarded the Nobel prize in medicine for her role in creating a drug that helped slash malaria mortality rates in Africa and Asia, saving millions of lives.
Yet for all her achievements, Tu, who is now 84, remains a little known figure, even in her native China where she had drifted into obscurity despite the magnitude of her discovery.
As news of Tu's victory reached her native land on Monday night, one fan wrote on Weibo, China's Twitter: "Recognised at last!"
Tu was born in Ningbo, a port city about 140 miles south of Shanghai, in 1930. She was named after a verse in the Book of Songs, a collection of ancient Chinese poetry that is believed to have been compiled by Confucius. Tu chose medicine, not philosophy, when she left Zhejiang and headed to China's capital to further her studies in 1951.
She enrolled at the Peking University School of Medicine and graduated from its Department of Pharmacology four years later.
From university Tu moved to the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She married Li Tingzhao, a former school classmate and factory worker with whom she would have two daughters, and settled down in Beijing.
Then, in 1969, everything changed when Tu was recruited to a medical research project so secret it was known only as "523".
The unit had been created two years earlier - on 23 May 1967 - on the orders of Chairman Mao, who hoped to find a way of halting the spread of malaria, a disease that was decimating North Vietnamese troops fighting in the jungles to China's south-west.
Tu was tasked with searching in nature for a new malaria treatment and was sent to Hainan, a tropical island off China's southern coast that has long struggled with its blight.
