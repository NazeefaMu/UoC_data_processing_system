Aaron Finch laments Australias horrific batting:
Car crash in slow motion
Australia captain Aaron Finch was disappointed at how his side got shot out for 89 by Pakistan in the first T20I, likening the performance to a car crash in slow motion.
In a chase of 156, Australia slipped to 22/6 inside the Powerplay as Imad Wasim and Faheem Ashraf wreaked havoc, and it was only through a 38-run stand for the seventh wicket between Ashton Agar and Nathan Coulter-Nile that they were able to recover somewhat.
Finch, who himself got out for a duck, didnt mince words in his assessment of the top order and took the blame for failing to get his team off to a better start.
Opening the batting, its my responsibility to get us off to a good start and set up the chase there, said Finch. I take full responsibility for that.
I think any time that youre chasing a total like that its important you have a solid start and for me to get out in the first over and not give us that was not good enough. That Powerplay was horrific ... it was like a car crash in slow motion.
Finch admitted that there could be a few shake-ups to the personnel after that awful performance, particularly in the batting department. He did however spare a word of praise for the bowlers, who kept Pakistan in check despite opener Babar Azam scoring an unbeaten 68.
I think all in all, our bowling performance was pretty good. Our fielding was slightly sloppy, then the batting was awful. Definitely when that happens, when you lose a game so badly, you have to look at everything.
For Pakistan, theyll have fewer selection considerations to make ahead of the second T20I at Dubai on Friday if any at all. They looked solid in all departments. Not too many batsmen had a chance after a lengthy 73-run partnership between Azam and Mohammad Hafeez for the second wicket, but a eight-ball 17 not out cameo by Hasan Ali in the end gave Pakistan late impetus.
Sarfraz Ahmed the captain was delighted at the overall performance.The partnership between Babar and Hafeez was crucial for us. We knew, if we make 160, we will be in the game, he said.
We want to take wickets in the Powerplay and we did that today. Imad was superb in his comeback match. The hitting done by Hassan Ali in the death overs dragged the total over 150 and that brought us back in the match.

Colombo Ports Eastern Terminal to remain a state-owned entity
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between Sri Lanka and India on April 26, last year, had not mentioned anything about handing over the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port to India.
It was in response to a question raised on whether there was any truth to the rumours on the subject.
He was addressing the media at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Headquarters, yesterday.
Section 9 of the MOU mentioned the development of a container terminal at the Colombo Port as a joint venture with Indian investments, considering that the majority of transshipments at the Colombo Port was related to India. It also stated that the government would announce the awarding of the contract by May, last year, the minister said.
The Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port would not be privatised as the governments stance was to run it as a state-owned entity, he added.
Minister Samarasinghe said that the government had no intention of privatising the Eastern Terminal (ET) of the Colombo Port and therefore, he had submitted a Cabinet paper seeking approval for the further development of it.
I seek approval for international tenders to supply the necessary cranes to the terminal. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) has invested US$80 million to develop the Eastern Terminal and another US$80 million will be be required to install the necessary equipment, including cranes, the minister said, adding that the SLPA could set aside US$ 80 million for the latter.
Furthermore, the government had no objection to hand over the development of the Colombo Port's Western Terminal to India as a joint venture, he added.
President Sirisena recently discussed the need to run the Colombo Port's Eastern Terminal as a state-owned entity with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while participating in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Summit, the minister said.
He said that only deep terminals could handle large modern vessels. Hence, the Colombo Port's Eastern Terminal was the only state-owned terminal that could accommodate and handle such vessels. If the ET were to be privatised, the SLPA would be unable to handle large vessels, Minister Samarasinghe added.
The Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT), which was leased to China for a 35-year period during Mahinda Rajapaksas regime, could also handle such large vessels.

No proof of Middle Easterners in caravan - Trump
US: US President Donald Trump told reporters assembled in the Oval Office on Tuesday that he has very good information that there are Middle Easterners in the caravan, but admitted he has no proof.
There's no proof of anything. There's no proof of anything. But there could very well be, Trump said.
Trump was asked about why he is implying that Middle Easterners are terrorists, and he responded by saying Customs and Border Patrol has intercepted both good and bad people at the border from the Middle East.
Over the course of the year, over the course of a number of years, they have intercepted many people from the Middle East. They have intercepted Islamic State (ISIS). They have intercepted all sorts of people. They have intercepted good ones and bad ones. They have intercepted wonderful people from the Middle East. And they have intercepted bad ones, Trump said.
While meeting with reporters, Trump asked Vice President Mike Pence to comment on his conversation with the president of Honduras. Pence said the caravan was financed by Venezuela.
At the president's discretion, I spoke to President Hernandez of Honduras, Pence said. He told me that the caravan that is now making its way through Mexico, headed for the southern border, was organized by leftist organizations and financed by Venezuela.
Pence doubled down earlier Tuesday on the president's assertion that Middle Easterners have infiltrated a caravan of Central American migrants traveling through Mexico to the U.S. border.
It's inconceivable that there are not people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than 7,000 people advancing toward our border, Pence said in a conversation with the Washington Post on Tuesday morning.
Pence backed up President Donald Trump's statements that people from the Middle East were mixed in with the thousands of migrants traveling to the nation's southern border to escape violence and poverty in their countries.
Trump made the comments in a tweet Monday and repeated them during a campaign rally in Houston later that night, also claiming that MS-13 gang members were part of the caravan. In recent days, Trump has attempted to make the migrant caravan a midterm campaign issue by blaming Democrats for not cooperating with him on immigration reform.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer dismissed Trump's claim as a diversion from other issues, particularly health care, ahead of the midterm elections. Efforts to reach a compromise in Congress on immigration reform stalled in June after Trump refused to back a bill that didn't include radical reductions to the current legal immigration system.

All state hospitals will be computerized and networked by next year (2019) and the eHealth card will be introduced for all Sri Lanka citizens, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, once the computerization process is complete, the free health service can be offered to all citizens without any difference.
He was addressing the fourth Industrial Revolution and Healthcare Conference at the Kingsbury Hotel in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said that by next year a gene technology laboratory will be set up in Sri Lanka. About 40 percent of the total population of Sri Lanka has gene differences. According to gene technology based medical science, different methods of treatment are used for the same disease based on the specific patients genes.
When I took over the Health Ministry, there was a shortage of 44 to 75 drugs and 10 percent wastage. A new computer software was introduced to prevent this situation. Now, there is no drug shortage or wastage. The Health Ministry now saves money and uses the savings to provide free eye lenses, heart stents etc. This is how modern technology has been used for the well being of the people, Minister Senaratne added.

Maj. Gen. Hettiaarachchi's wish to convert Jaffna into another Singapore:
Army to help Jaffna war-torn people stand on their feet
Jaffna has witnessed unprecedented development under the present Northern Commander Major General Darshana Hettiaarachchi. He has tirelessly and effortlessly ploughed into re-building Jaffna and had done so with nothing up his sleeve except for 'one objective 'and that was to see the wellbeing of the poorest segments of the Northern Tamils. It is not an exaggeration to say that his eyes drowned in tears as he recalled their sordid plight. "They are poor and innocent people and I felt that I should do my utmost best for their welfare as a Buddhist, let alone being the Northern Commander, it was my duty to dispense my duties to keep them happy," said an emotional Darshana at the recently held Colombo based Defence Seminar 'Achievements.'
Large scale housing projects
Large scale housing projects have already been completed in Keerimalai, Thelippalai, Karainagar, Point Pedro, Alaveddy and Periyawillan. This apart, Jaffna's civilians have been recipients of artificial limbs, cement to build their kovils, cattle, monthly distribution of milk packets, donations for kovils, 100 sewing machines and sanitary items. Also 9,500 coconut seedlings had been distributed among households, while Palmyrah growing had been incredibly encouraged. A collaborative effort of the Army and the Coconut Cultivation Board would as a result, witness massive coconut plantations on all occupied lands. Already 25,000 coconut seedlings have been rooted. Jaffna peninsula's coast conservation in collaboration with the Coast Conservation Department is underway not to forget re-forestation that is being assisted by the Forest Department in Army occupied lands.
Helping farmers to till their lands facilitating agricultural growth are done by the assistance of Army's tractors.
Significantly, funding cataract surgeries are the Kadawatha Lions that transport patients for surgery to the Lions hospital in Kadawatha. Theatre costs, spectacles, accommodation and food are also provided by them.
Medical camps and scholarships for children
A total 17 medical camps and 19 blood donation endeavours, construction of hospital buildings in Kayts, Velani, Murunthankerny, Chankanai, Waddukkodai and Kodikkamam have been realized. Scholarships and computers have also been provided to 850 children, while Grade 5 scholars have been felicitated along with the best performers at the O' Levels and A' Levels. They were recipients to stationary and books, while bicycles were distributed among 450 needy students.
The recruitment of 111 Tamil youth into the Army is also noteworthy. Never had this been done earlier.
Army personnel posthumously donate eyes, body organs
Over 10,000 Army personnel have posthumously given their consent for their eyes and body organs to be donated as well.
Several parks have been built, while the Hartley College grounds was redone free of charge by the Army. Further, the religious wing of Tamil Eelam, the local Parish was also renovated free of charge. "I have no bias towards anyone!" said this humanist and liberalist to whom a warped communal mindset is a stranger.
Southern well wishers are also currently funding nearly 10,000 families with sanitary facilities.
The Jaffna Super Cross to be re-introduced
An annual motor race named 'Jaffna Super Cross', once an event only for the Colombo bourgeoisie including the Rajapakse offspring, is also being planned. Yet to come in was Rugger - a favourite past time of the former ruling elite, which reminds this writer of how though ironically, poverty alleviation is common to both political parties.
Vesak, Deepavali, Thaipongal celebrated on grand scale
Also of a unique nature was the unusually grand scale of Vesak, Deepavali and Thai Pongal celebrations, where General Dharshana Hettiarchchi was seen personally supervising the cooking and serving of lunch. The future would also witness Army women rendering devotional Tamil songs at Tamil religious ceremonies. This well read Northern Commander is indeed a rare blessing to the Army for he unfailingly recalled India's world acclaimed poet Rabindranath Tagore when he quoted, "Where the world has not been broken into fragments by narrow domestic walls; the walls of caste, creed, race and religion.
Special constraints do not permit this writer's first to name the diverse individuals and organizations that have ungrudgingly given of their best to General Dharshana Hettiaarachchi to rebuild Jaffna besides the government funds that keep rolling in and he is eternally grateful to one and all for bringing Jaffna to what it is today.
"My ambition is to create Jaffna a Singapore, he said, when questioned about the future of this long neglected peninsula.
To him, consulting the people takes top priority in all developmental efforts. As for political freedom, it is sure to culminate only in the formation of the Tamil political elite - a repetition of the Southern Sinhala political elite - both of whom are hell bent on hoodwinking the masses and building unbounded financial reserves for their own unborn generations. At this point, the historical reference to the British leaving behind a political elite on their exit from our territorial entity is inevitable.
Bringing relief to neglected Tamil masses
In the post-independence years that followed, we witnessed these elites resorting to unprecedented corruption that saw a reverse of the positive trade balance the British left when closing shop here. So, it is far better to have a General in the calibre of Dharshana Hettiaarachchi to turn Jaffna into a Singapore, bringing relief to that neglected locality's innocent Tamil masses, than to have them suffer under Tamil elite hegemony which exactly had been the happenings in the South - the stampede over the Sinhala masses by the corrupt Sinhala political elite - Karu Jayasuriya being an exception. Ironically, Sri Lankans view his age over integrity as an impediment to leadership, whereas an enlightened Malaysian populace have invited Mahathir Mohammed at the age of 92 as Prime Ministerial deposit to clean up Malaysia 's Aegean Stables. Incidentally, Karu is 20 years Mahathir's chronological junior, but still 'unsuited 'to lead!!
This writer's numerous attempts to get at Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, remained futile.
His parallel this writer found in R. Sampanthan's Press Secretary whose chosen preference was a ' deafening mute' in her attempts to get at him at the cost of her wallet. Elitist arrogance will hold no good be it in the South or the North. Once in power, they, like their Southern twin brothers, the Sinhala elitists, would undoubtedly not be equal to the task!

Babies recreate Mickey Mouses most iconic looks
To celebrate Mickey Mouses 90th birthday which will fall on November 18, 2018, Babble teamed up with Karen Marie of Belly Beautiful Portraits to recreate his most legendary looks using some of the cutest models around - sweet newborn babies.
Marie, a longtime Disney fan - whom you might remember from her previous Babble collaboration where she dressed babies as Disney villains, or when she transformed them into Disney princesses - pays beautiful homage to Mickey in her latest shoot. She says she was particularly excited about this project for personal reasons.
A famous Walt Disney quote that really resonated with me while researching this project was, I only hope that we never lose sight of one thing - that it was all started by a mouse, says Marie.
Marie explains that, like many of us, she grew up watching Walt Disney classics like The Little Mermaid and visiting Disneyland with her family - traditions she now shares with her own children. These memories also provide emotional inspiration for her work.
For all of these [memories], I can thank Mickey Mouse, she says.
The photographer tells Babble that each image was created in painstaking detail (with help from Sew Trendy Accessories and Off My Hooks) in order to capture the essence of each Mickey Mouse persona. According to Marie, it takes a village to create each photo, which includes hand-sewn costumes and custom-made props.
There are so many moving parts that need to line up just perfectly, says Marie.
So, without further ado, lets take a look at some of the outfits that made Mickeys most well-known film and TV appearances so memorable!

Positive thinking is the background of modern philosophy of living a successful and happy life
Be  positive!
Being optimistic is often portrayed as a foundation for making your life full and happy. And really, these are not just words. There are several benefits in positive thinking which influence our health, confidence and relationships with other people.
If youre not one of these positive-thinkers yet and wonder why you should try positive thinking yourself, here are some reasons for you:
1. Positive thinkers cope with stress faster and more effectively.
If an unpleasant situation happens, they concentrate on solving it rather than thinking that the things are out of their control. Actually, they are less subjected to stress as they dont have a habit to concentrate on their negative thought.
2. Better health.
Its proven that those who think positively live longer and feel better than those who dont. All negative emotions reflect immediately on our body, and when we are stressed and have depressive thoughts, we face sleep problems, our muscles become tense, we become anxious and feel dissatisfied with everything. And as we get rid of the destructive thought, we also get rid of their physical result.
3. You have better relationships with people.
Positive and open people make a better first impression and usually have a lot of friends. People usually are attracted to positive persons and want to maintain a friendship with them, thats why positive thinkers have an active social life. The same goes for romantic relationships, as such people attract more attention of the opposite sex.
4. A positive way of thought lets you be more focused and concentrated.
When you realize that the problem is not the end of the world, you learn to stay more focused when you face the problems. As a result, you can make the right decisions even in the difficult situation.
5. More confidence.
A positive way of thought learns you to be more confident. You dont want to pretend and be someone else, you learn to love yourself and to be yourself, and it boosts your confidence.
6. Positibe thinkers are more successful in life.
Positive people tend not to concentrate on their failures and see more life opportunities. They are open to learning and trying something new. Thats why they are more successful in their careers.
7. They have a happier life.
The optimistic people usually live happier and more productive life. Remember the law of attraction  if the person thinks positive, she attracts more positive events in her life. If the person is grateful for everything she has, she will get even more of this.
So, dont concentrate on your problems, be optimistic and your life will change in the better way!

BOAT SHOW & BOATING FESTIVAL  SRI LANKA 2018 begins today
Boat Show & Boating Festival Sri Lanka 2018 is organized by Boat Building Technology Improvement Institute (BTI) and Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), in association with Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, Ministry of Ports and Shipping and Sri Lanka Ports Authority at Galle Yacht Marina, Port of Galle from October 26  28, 2018.
Boat Building industry has identified as a leading industry and an emerging export sector and has also been identified as one of the key sectors in the National Export Strategy (NES) 2018  2022 for Sri Lanka.
Organizing of the Boat Show Sri Lanka which commenced in 2008 is one of the main activities which is also recommended in the National Export Strategy (NES), undertaken to promote the industry. The Show organized once in two years, provides a forum for the industry to display and promote their products to potential clients whilst creating investment opportunities in boat and ship building, training, marine infrastructure and marine tourism.
The 6th Edition of the Boat Show will be organized October 26  28, 2018 with a novel concept and named as Boat Show and Boating Festival 2018, which is the first ever boating festival in Sri Lanka organized to showcase the countrys capabilities in marine tourism, recreational boating, yachting and boat building which is mainly focused on exports.
Although Sri Lanka has a long history in boat building, the nation is currently not engaged in boating activities and therefore, it is necessary to create an interest amongst the local community in boating activities. Building a strong local market will benefit to the countrys export market as well. Considering the above this years boat show will focus on boating activities and nautical tourism.
This year the show will be organized in the Galle Port. The mini marina will be used to berth vessels to be displayed and for water activities and the land area surrounding the marina for exhibiting boating related products and services.
The inauguration ceremony of the Boat Show & Boating Festival will be held on October 26, 2018 at 3.00 pm. The First Vice President of the Republic of Burundi, Gaston Sindimwo and Jean Bosco Nutunzwenimana, Minister of Transport, Public Works, Equipment and Territory Management will visit the Boat Show 2018 on the invitation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and will grace the opening ceremony as the guests of honour.
Number of international buyers and visitors will be visiting the Boat Show from countries such as Maldives, Sweden, Italy, UAE, India, Poland, Belgium, Pakistan, Seashells and Mauritius.
Considering the importance of enhancing the International Profile of Sri Lanka as a Marine Tourism destination and a quality boat manufacturing hub and encouraging the boat manufacturing industry to adopt new technology and manufacturing techniques, EDB and BTI propose to organize an International Conference on Nautical Tourism on October 27, 2018at Jetwing Light House Hotel in Galle parallel to the Boat Show & Boating Festival 2018.
It is expected that 100  150 participants from the industry will participate at the conference including boat manufacturers, chartering companies, students of marine industry and journalists.

The speakers are: Mike Derret , International Marina Expert, UK, Sandrine Devos, representative from European Boating Institute (EBI), Michal Bak, Secretary General, Polish Chamber of Marine Industry and Water Sports (POLBOAT).

Book on worlds most loved hobby
Collecting stamps is a hobby both young and old can enjoy. Stamps are miniature gateways to the world as they depict geography, biography, history, culture and art of various countries.
Philatelic Journalist and representative of the International Association of Philatelic Journalists, Anura Samaraweera through his latest book `A Guide to Stamp Collecting opens avenues for young enthusiasts to learn the unknown facts about stamp collecting.
Children and teenagers were early collectors of stamps. Many adults dismissed it as a childish pursuit but later many of those same collectors, as adults, began to systematically study the available postage stamps and publish books about them. Today, though the number of collectors is somewhat less, stamp collecting is still one of the world's most popular indoor hobbies. There are thousands of organizations for collectors such as local stamp clubs, special-interest groups, and national organizations. Most nations have a national collectors' organization. Stamp clubs and philatelic societies can add a social aspect to stamp collecting and provide a forum where novices can meet experienced collectors, he said.
Samaraweera has started penning books on stamps in 1984 when he was working as a Postal Officer at the Postal Department. He has researched and gathered information on stamps and has contributed many articles on stamp collecting to Mihira, Bindu, Navayugaya among many other childrens papers.
Through my latest book I intend to introduce stamp collecting to beginners and guide them on how to make an exhibit in international exhibitions. Many casual stamp collectors accumulate stamps for sheer enjoyment and relaxation without worrying about the tiny details. The creation of a large or comprehensive collection, however, generally requires some philatelic knowledge and will usually contain areas of philatelic studies, he said.
He pointed out that most of the collectors are not aware of the opportunities that exist at international level for stamp collectors. Samaraweera is Sri Lankas National Commissioner for the World Stamp Exhibition Thailand, one of the worlds high profile philatelic event displaying approximately 2,500 frames of exhibits from all Federation Internationale de Philatelie (FIP) member countries.
He has bagged the Silver Brown award at Hong Kong EXPO International 2004, Large Silver at Kuala Lampur Stamp Show, Silver Brown at Taipei 2005 International Stamp Exhibition and Silver Brown award at Bangkok International Stamp Exhibition.

Canine Lessons
Dogs are such phenomenal teachers for us. They teach us about gratitude, love and compassion, being present, and joy. But they teach us more than that.
1. Looks can be deceiving
Dont judge a book by its cover; a very big man or woman can be hiding inside any body.
2. Allow fresh air and wind in your face whenever possible
Dogs truly do know how to live in the moment. I dont stick my head out the car window, but I try to appreciate the spring smells and fresh air. Dogs arent thinking about tomorrow, they are excited for this very moment all the time. You can be too.
3. Be loyal
If only we could all be the person our dogs think we are. When you think youve lost everything, take a good look around, I guarantee your dog will still be there, full of love and admiration.
4. Never to pretend to be something youre not
Dogs dont care what other dogs think. They have adorable personalities and we love them for it. Embrace your own adorable personality.
5. You are never too old to play
Life is short, so have fun and stop taking everything so seriously.
6. When loved ones come home, always greet them
Take an opportunity every day to tell those who mean the most to you that you are happy to see them.
7. Stretch before rising
This is a good one to follow especially as we get older. I often see my dog stretching into downward facing dog. It makes me smile every time.
8. Avoid biting when growling will do
Stand up for yourself, but no need to be unnecessarily aggressive or harmful.
9. Forgive
Dont hold grudges, even if someone hurt you; you have the choice to forgive.
10. Show compassion
Dogs are kind souls, full of compassion and love. In times where I have been upset, my dog is the first one to cuddle and comfort me.
11. Trust your instincts
Trust your initial instincts of a situation or person, before you let the mental chatter in your mind tell you youre wrong. Your gut instinct is usually correct.
12. Things dont matter
A dog can have the best time with an old worn out ball. You can find joy in small things. Lose your obsessions over materiality.
13. Go for walks every day
Dogs are oddly excited by going for walks whereas some days I feel I have to convince myself to go. Appreciate the opportunity to get outside and be within nature; take in the smells, sights and feelings.
14. Love unconditionally
Love yourself, your friends, your kids, your family, your job, your community and most of all, love mother earth.
15. Get lots of rest
You know the old saying, let sleeping dogs lie. Dogs love to sleep, and we should not downplay our need for rest either.

In view of the diverse nature of the land use and to maintain homogeneity, three sub-indices for residential, commercial and industrial lands are computed separately, using per perch bare land prices collected from the Government Valuation Department.
The overall LPI is computed by taking the average of these three sub-indices.

Colourful Warne joins MCC World Cricket committee
LONDON, Thursday: Australian spin great Shane Warne said he had plenty to offer as he was appointed to the MCCs influential World Cricket committee, which suggests changes to the games laws.
The 49-year-old replaces fellow Australian Rod Marsh, who stepped down after serving on the committee since 2012.
It is an honour to have been asked to be a member of the MCC World Cricket committee, Warne said in a statement.
It is an extremely exciting time for cricket and I hope that I will have plenty to offer in discussion and debate. I look forward to contributing to the work of the committee.
Warne has gained a reputation for his robust views. This week, he said Australias Test team needed a kick up the backside after their series defeat to Pakistan.
As a player, he was the first bowler to reach 700 Test wickets and his final tally of 708, in 145 Tests from 1992 to 2007, is second on the all-time list.
Committee chairman Mike Gatting, flummoxed by Warnes famous ball of the century during the 1993 Ashes series, said he was delighted to have the Australian on board.
Obviously his profile in the world game is as big as they come and with his extensive experience, I am sure he will offer great insights into many different facets of the game, Gatting said.
Recommendations of the committee, which meets twice a year, have resulted in innovations including day/night Test cricket and limiting the size of bats.
At its last meeting in August, the committee raised the idea of using a shot clock to speed up play.  AFP

Comforting a sick dog
Identify a sick dog
Dogs are friendly companion animals, who cannot talk to express their requirements. Therefore you have to identify when the dog is sick and informed to the veterinarian. Always try to meet a qualified vet to treat your dog. You know your own dog better than anyone else, so you may be the first to notice that something is wrong.
According to the age and breed of the dog behaviors can be changed. Older dogs and some breeds of dogs are very lazy and they sleep most of the time. But puppies and some breeds of dogs are very energetic and are very active. You must have thorough understanding about the behavior pattern of your dog before you decide whether the animal is sick or not.
Signs of sickness
It's important to understand that dogs do not generally exhibit signs of illness when they first become sick. It is believed that they instinctively hide their illness as a form of self-protection as appearing weak would make them vulnerable in the wild. In addition, dogs are not emotionally attached to their own discomfort the way humans are, so they are more likely to act normally when they feel sick.
Here are some signs to watch for that might indicate the need for veterinary attention. When in doubt, don't wait. If your pet exhibits any signs that do not seem normal, call your vet right away. There are two main types of signs
1. General signs
Body temperature over 104 F or under 99 F (normal is typically 100.5 C -102.5 C), Poor appetite, Lethargy, Weakness, Appetite change associated with weight loss or gain and change in activity level, sleeping more than normal, or other behavior or attitude changes are some general signs of a sick dog.
2. Specific signs
These signs are related to specific organ system in the body.White or very pale gums  signs of blood parasites or internal bleeding or any severe woundLabored breathing, nasal discharge, congestion, wheezing, frequent panting coughing, sneezing,  signs of respiratory diseaseCollapse or loss of consciousness  situation of comaDizziness, seizures, imbalance, or circling  signs of a disease in the nervous systemInability to walk, lameness - signs of paralysis, distemper, joint or bone problemVomiting, diarrhea, constipation, extremely bloated abdomen  signs of diseases of the gastro intestinal tract Excessive salivation, bad breath or drooling  signs of disease in the mouth, RabiesFrequent and/or inappropriate urination, excessive thirst (increased water intake), bloody urine  signs of disease in the urinary system Excessive scratching or dull, dry, or flaky hair coat, sores, lumps, or shaking of the head signs of mange, external parasites, deficiency disease
The information needed for the vet
As your dog cannot talk you have to visit the vet with information making it easy for the vet to get a clue about the disease. This will help quick diagnosis, treatment and minimize the miss diagnosis. Information that you have to carry are the changes of the behavior, eating and drinking pattern and amount, details of stools and urine, details of gesture and posture, any discharge from any part of the body (colour and amount), previous history of diseases, vaccination record, anything you might feel important for the vet etc.
Common diseases
There are several diseases of dogs commonly present in Sri Lanka. They are Parvo viral diarrhea, Distemper, Mange, pyometra, Tick fever and gastro intestinal tract diseases. Some of these diseases are curable and mainly viral diseases are incurable. Dogs should be vaccinated against viral diseases annually.
Preventing diseases
Vaccination is the main method of preventing diseases. Dogs have to be vaccinated against Parvo viral disease at the age of 6-8 weeks, 3 months and annually. Distemper vaccination should be given at the age of 8-10 weeks, 3 months and annually. Deadly Rabies disease can be prevented by vaccinating at the age of 6 weeks (or when you get the dog), 14 weeks after first vaccination and annually.
There are treatments for other diseases. Tick fever can be prevented by oral drugs. Worms can be prevented by worm treatment. Before giving any treatment to your pet dog it is a must to consult a vet.
Keeping the sick dog comfortably
When your pet is sick it needs love and care. You have to follow all instructions that is given by the vet for quick recovery. Keep the dog in a calm and quiet place as external sounds may disturb the rest. The place should be comfortable and warm. Dont keep on the cement floor which is very cool. If the vet recommended making the dog warm place glass bottles filled with warm water around it. Refill the warm water into these bottles when they are cold. Love and pet the dog and dont allow to be left alone. If the dog passes urine and tools remove all and clean the body with warm water. Do not bathe the dog until the vet recommends. Wet sponge bath is recommended for cleaning only.

Conquering lion fortress
Juliet Coombe learns about King Kashyapas rock palace, Sigiriya and discovers the many pathways and gardens of ancient regal life.
Sigiriya rock palace is a magnificent site that everyone should go and see, at least once in their life, as it is so impressive and beautiful that it leaves all who visit it humbled by the amazing engineering and natural architectural skills of the past.
Walking through the beautiful arrangement of boulder gardens early morning is lovely before the heat of the day sets in, but after 9am it is worth bringing a hat and umbrella to protect oneself from the harsh tropical weather. To enjoy the gardens and their natural fountains try to organize a trip to Sigriya between January to early February, when it rains and the underground hydraulics often kick in and bring the old palace gardens magically back to life.
I felt walking through each section increasingly dwarfed by the sheer size and majesty of this massive bold outcrop on the surrounding awe-inspiring landscape. Its sheer faces and overhangs challenge even the boldest of spirits and when the wind is gusting, despite all the safety equipment, one is occasionally left with heart in mouth, especially when contemplating sudden heavy rainfall or ill timed tectonic movements. Strip away all the modernity from this beast and you are left with countless little cuttings in the big rock that form impossible rocky pathways and great spots for the local wildlife. Sadly the poetic quotes of previous travellers over the centuries have more or less rubbed off the mirror wall.
Going ever upwards I am thrilled by the incredible views of the surrounding area. As the climb takes me from one side of the rock to the other deeper crevices I discover caves where Mans art has taken a miniscule hold to define a moment in its history where bare-breasted beauties of various nations are temporarily immortalised for all time and celebrated in a way not seen today with its locals and foreigners divisions. Then again one is confronted with Mans modern failings by the frequent warnings and pleadings, ignored in past-times, not to deface the beautiful Sinhalese writings that reflect old musings on the beauties above.
Having made it up to the Lions feet and stairway to the king Kashyapas palace way above guarded today by hornets nests I am reminded that silence is essential to get past these sentinels with dangerous stings. Ever grander vistas prepare one gradually for the final climb to the ruins of a community of people who once served their king in self-sufficient style. As I made the final ascent and after musing at a funny sign depicting what look like someone jumping over the edge chased by flies, I see two more giant hornets nests hanging from the majestic rock with far more power to protect the sanctity of the place than the lions feet beneath. Later I learnt that hornets had attacked many groups in the past for being too loud and I guess this is a lesson to all of us entering a royal palace with our heads bowed and in silence. Just above the nests I could see the smallest of pathways cut into the rock for this final section and marveled that anyone could walk along these tiny niches let alone carry anything with them and then what if it rains or gusts with wind or worse, both. The thought made me cling to the spiral staircase that takes you to the top of the Sigiriya rock palace.
Arriving at the summit of the rock, Im first struck with wonderful views across the top with a craggy tree framing mountains in the background all surrounded by a huge expanse of a very varied landscape of forests, ponds, fields and rocks with scatterings of humanity punctuating the spaces in between. Im fortunate enough to see the rare sight of the fastest bird in Sri Lanka, the Shaheen Falcon, which glides across the rock just above its horizon and then disappears below it.
The top of the rock is a marvel and one feels compelled to jump with joy on arrival to celebrate the climb and splendid ancient architecture with the remains of all parts of this micro-ecosystem created for the king of kings. There was plenty of activity going on to maintain the walls and vegetable garden and people taking pictures of the incredible views.
A large swimming pool looked very inviting now it was so hot if it hadnt been so windy and as you stand at the far end of it looking in you can find yourself being transported back to a time when time went slow, you grew your own food, slept at sunset and got up at sunrise, served perhaps one master who cared about the future and not just today. A time when women were worshipped in their beautiful nude form, by the king who lay out on the largest stone chaise longue overlooking a pool, I have ever seen and today labeled as the throne.
The views all around are stunning and have to be seen to be believed but I couldnt help wondering what happened to a civilization as great as the Roman and Greek empire. That said I was inspired by the greatness of the past and the way down was just as appealing as the views of the gardens below are amazing from all angles and we were again treated to the sight of the Shaheen falcon circling around us before alighting in its cave above the sheer rock face. Near the bottom we deviated down a path towards the Foreigners car park and strangely found ourselves at a sheer-faced dead-end amongst countless boulders. As we returned to the sign a gardener who beckoned us to show us the way met us. Well weve all seen naughty kids that have turned signs around and this naughty one of about 80 years old wanted retribution for his trouble! Needless to say I nearly asked him for the same for unnecessarily inconveniencing us.
As we got near the real foreigners car park we weaved our way through eleven floor levels (terraces) and a number of very large boulders all with little stair cuttings inserted on the side of the main rock, which was clearly the original way people reached the heady heights of the palace. Walking past these funny little paths, past one or two with highly ornate ancient plastered frescoed artworks accompanied by a symphony of cicadas, crickets, birds and many other wonderful unidentified sounds was simply amazing. This is truly a magical place with many visual gems to discover and savor, just go early to avoid the crowds and keep quiet to hear those ancient voices whispering their secrets about the natural water fountains of Sigiriyas amazing underwater boulder gardens hydraulics, which also work after very heavy rains in a freak storm.

Countrys economy on the brink of collapse: MP
The countrys economy was on the brink of collapse with the US Dollar exchange rate reaching Rs.180, Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
The Parliamentarian was speaking at a press conference recently held at the MEP Headquarters at Maharagama.
If the Rupee were to depreciate any further, it would disrupt the livelihood of the nation, he said.
Although the government had one and a half years more to complete its term of office, its actions did not win the confidence of the public, the MP said; even when an alleged conspiracy against President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa came to light, the government was slow to take action.
MP Gunawardena said that most proposals made by the United National Party in the coalition government had been criticised or rejected by President Sirisena.
The country was facing a trade deficit as imports were in excess while exports dropped, he said, adding that although the government had pledged to set up a Volkswagen factory at Kuliyapitiya, as well as provide free Wi-Fi, they had not yet received any foreign investments.
The Board of Directors of the Bank of Ceylon and the Peoples Bank had been made to resign from their posts. Such action would result in the loss of investor confidence and would aggravate the prevailing economic crisis, he added.

Dwayne Bravo retires from international cricket
Windies all-rounder Dwayne Bravo has announced his retirement from all formats of the game. However, the 35-year-old will continue to play T20 franchise cricket around the world.
Bravo made his last international appearance for the Windies more than two years ago, a T20I match against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. Bravo last played an ODI in October 2014 and has not made an appearance for the Windies in Test cricket since December 2010.
Today I want to confirm to the cricket world that I have officially retired from international cricket in all formats of the game. After 14 years when I made my debut for the West Indies, I still remember that moment I received the maroon cap before walking onto the Lords Cricket Ground against England in July 2004. The enthusiasm and passion I felt then, I have kept with me throughout my career, Bravo said in a media statement.
However, I must accept that for me to preserve my longevity as a professional cricketer, I must do as others before have done, leave the international arena for the next generation of players.
I thank the countless persons who were instrumental to my success, particularly my family and QPCC where I developed my skills at an early age, Bravo said. I thank the many loyal fans who continue to support my journey and who recognize my efforts on and off the field. I am extremely fortunate to have a career that has taken me across the globe into the most prestigious dressing rooms sharing experiences with all the recent legends of this glorious game. I will continue my professional career as a cricketer and entertainer living as a true champion.
He ends his career with 2,200 runs and 86 wickets in Tests; 2,968 ODI runs and 199 wickets; and 1,142 runs and 52 wickets in T20I cricket.

Dyson to build electric cars in Singapore
British technology company Dyson will not build its new electric cars in the United Kingdom, opting instead to manufacture in Singapore due to its proximity to China, the worlds largest electric car market.
In a memo to staff this week, Dyson chief executive Jim Rowan said that the company would commence construction on a car plant in Singapore in December, which will be completed in 2020.
The decision to build the plant abroad has led to controversy in the UK. Dyson founder and chief engineer James Dyson is a supporter of Britains departure from the European Union, stating that British manufacturing could benefit from Brexit.
Its strange Brexiteer James Dyson has so little faith in the prospect of the UK leaving the EU that he is manufacturing his electric cars in Asia, said Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrat party.
Ian Murray, a Member of Parliament for the Labour Party and member of anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain, said: When even someone who claims there will be a resurgence in British manufacturing after Brexit isnt prepared to put his money where his mouth is, it raises serious questions about the future of our economy.
Dyson, most known for its vacuum cleaners and other household appliances, revealed two years ago that it had initiated a 2-billion-pound ($2.59 billion) project to design an electric vehicle.
James Dyson said last year that the company was considering the merits of establishing the manufacturing site in either the UK or Asia.
In the memo, Rowan said that Singapore offers an extensive supply chain and skilled workforce as well as access to high-growth markets. Over 1 million electric cars were sold around the world in 2017, with more than half of global sales in China, according to the International Energy Agency.
Dyson already employs 1,100 people in Singapore, where the company produces motors for some of its household appliances.
The decision of where to make our car is complex, based on supply chains, access to markets, and the availability of the expertise that will help us achieve our ambitions, said Rowan.
The United Kingdom is among the largest makers of combustion engine vehicles in Europe. The government has ambitions to lead electric car production in the region, though this may prove a tall order due to Brexit, says Julia Poliscanova, manager of clean vehicles at the European Federation for Transport and Environment, also called the EFT&E.
Brexit creates difficulty for the UK to lead in e-mobility, Poliscanova said in a previous interview. If they are outside of the bigger European market, and if there are tariffs, it will be very difficult to attract companies to develop products.
Out of the 17 major electric vehicle production investments made by automakers during the last year - which total 24.9 billion euros ($28.4 billion) - 10 have gone to China, seven have gone to France and Germany, and none have gone to Britain, according to the EFT&E.

Angunakolapelessa Prison protests
Eight inmates transferred
Eight prisoners who led the protest against the deployment of Special Task Force (STF) officers at the Angunakolapelessa Prison, had been transferred to other prisons on Wednesday evening.
They had been transferred to the Kalutara, Kuruwita, Galle, Matara, and Moneragala prisons as per a request made by them after they were found guilty. The inmates include 'Julampitiye Amare', 'Abeynayake' and 'Tangalle Mahesh', who had been charged with murder and drug-trafficking.
Over 100 prisoners staged the protest last Sunday, climbing a tower at the prison premises and demanding the removal of the STF officers as well as the transfer of the Angunakolapelessa Prison Superintendent.
The Special Task Force deployed by the government commenced a search inside the prison on October 17.
Meanwhile, a prison officer had lodged complaint with the Angunakolapelessa Police against an inmate called Thushara Abeynayake for allegedly entering a prison guard room by force on Monday.

Exterminators receives ISO 22000 certification
The Exterminators Pvt Ltd Sri Lankas premier pest control company was certified ISO 22000; 2005 Food Safety Management System (FSMS).
The extensive process began in 2017 as a proactive effort to meet the anticipating demand in food safety industry in Sri Lanka. Every segment of the food industry nowadays is required to have an effective, comprehensive, customized, integrated preventive pest management program in place and it is essential that food industry business works with a food safety certified pest management company.
ISO 22000 standards require this, because pest control is considered to be a critical control point. Other standards, such as those accredited by GSFI, go further in their management and auditing requirements. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka pest control is leased considered when it comes to food safety.
Pests, of course, should have no place in a facility that manufactures or serves food. Rats bites thousands of people each year and carry fever, salmonella, trichinosis, murine typhus, the plague, leptospirosis, and other disease causing pathogens. Cockroaches and flies, by walking through contaminated areas, the worst being sewage, can introduce e-coli, streptococcus, molds, salmonella, yeasts, cholera, clostridia, and a host of other bacteria into food.
Achieving this certification status is an important moment for our company. In July the company introduced the PACCP 2000  five force model in preventive pest management designed and developed by Exterminators to suit the tropical pest species, food safety standards, climate and the environment conditions in Sri Lanka. In August 2018 the company introduced the digital pest control technology for the first time in Sri Lanka. Today Exterminators is well prepared to take on the pest battle and provide an unmatchable pest management service second to none in the world, said Marlon Ferreira, Founder / CEO of Exterminators.
Exterminators ventured into the fierce but amazing pest control industry in 1998 with just one man with a spray gun and a motor bike, but with more force, drive and passion it has become Sri Lankas premier pest control company winning 47 awards for business, brand, industrial excellence and entrepreneurship and setting up benchmarks in the pest management industry in the emerging world and the SME sector.
Exterminators is Asias first Carbon Neutral and Sri Lankas first ISO 9001, ISO 14001 & OHSAS 18001 certified pest control company and a member of the SPMA-Singapore, NPMA-USA and the British Pest Control Association.

Accused of plotting to assassinate Police officer, VIPs
Former TID DIG Nalaka de Silva remanded
The former Director of the Terrorism Investigation Division (TID) Deputy Inspector General of Police Nalaka de Silva was remanded until November 7 by Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday evening.
The Criminal Investigation Department arrested Nalaka de Silva yesterday following interrogations. The former Director of the TID was questioned by the CID on four separate days previously.
Nalaka de Silva has been allegedly accused of plotting to assassinate SSP Prasanna Alwis, the President and a former Defence Secretary.
Anti Corruption Movement Operations Director Namal Kumara earlier revealed that the former director of Terrorist Investigation Division DIG Nalaka de Silva discussed with him an alleged plot to kill some political leaders.
Criminal Investigations Department officials on October 23 informed Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne that the voice recordings of telephone conversations between former Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) DIG Nalaka Silva and Anti Corruption Movement Operations Director Namal Kumara matched.
The CID informed the Fort Magistrate based on the Government Analysts report that 123 out of 124 voice samples of both Nalaka Silva and Namal Kumara matched.
On that occasion investigators cited that some data of Namal Kumaras mobile phone has been deleted and they cannot be retrieved as the department does not have the necessary technology .
They said that Namal Kumaras mobile phone would be sent to Hong Kong to retrieve the deleted data.
Investigators also disclosed that Namal Kumara had served in the Sri Lanka Air Force and later joined the Sri Lanka Army without being discharged from the Air Force. The CID told court that Namal Kumara had later served at the Avante Garde Security Service too and an investigation is being carried out into Namal Kumara.
The Law and Order Ministry, which acted immediately following revelations of the alleged plot, had recommended the National Police Commission to send Mr.de Silva on compulsory leave.
Later, the NPC approved the recommendation of the minister.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera had agreed to continue the Gamperaliya Rapid Rural Development Project, despite the obstacles the government had faced when expediting it, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
President Maithripala Sirisena had recently discussed the matter with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and Finance Minister Samaraweera.
A sum of Rs.200 million had been allocated to each electorate under the Gamperaliya Project, the minister said; The Prime Minister and Finance Minister have agreed to streamline this project within two weeks.
Asked about his views on Ministers Arjuna Ranatunga and Sarath Fonseka's counter-statements on the President saying that the United National Party's (UNP) founders' values were not being upheld by the UNP, Minister Samarasinghe said that the President never wanted to criticise anyone.
Speaking on estate workers' trade union actions to seek salary hikes, the minister said that it was unjust that they lacked certain facilities, adding that priority should be given to providing them with the necessary facilities as they were an integral part of the country's economy. When questioned on whether companies could pay estates workers Rs.1,000 per day, the minister said that they should not refuse; It is a fair request, it should be paid.
Minister Samarasinghe said that an executive committee would be established in addition to the Central Committee. The Sri Lanka Freedom Party Convention would commence with the participation of office bearers, once an executive committee meeting was held.
Highlighting the allegations levelled on army personnel for human rights violations during the United Nations Mission in Mali, the minister said that President Sirisena had expressed his dissatisfaction over the matter.
The President said that those allegations were not justifiable as they had been levelled by a non-governmental organisation, he said.
The Human Rights Commission said that they had come to a common consensus with the security forces to look into matters concerning those officers prior their deployment on foreign missions, Minister Samarasinghe said. President Sirisena said that the government could not agree with baseless allegations levelled by organisations backed by supporters of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), he added.

A great accolade
Sri Lanka Tourism is on a roll these days, buoyed by positive reviews in many major publications around the world. The latest to jump on the bandwagon is the highly respected travel bible Lonely Planet, which has selected Sri Lanka as the top destination to visit in 2019, pushing Germany and Zimbabwe into second and third place. This is not the first time that the prestigious Australia-based travel publisher has bestowed this honour on Sri Lanka  the country topped the list for 2013-2014 as well.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who made a special statement on the naming of Sri Lanka as the top destination to visit in 2019 said this achievement should be a starting point to go to a higher level in tourism.Let us make this award, for us, a starting point to go to a higher level of tourism, he said.
Lonely Planet, which has been publishing a best-selling guidebook on Sri Lanka for decades, cited better transport links, new hotels and a growing number of activities as the reason the South Asian island was chosen for the top spot in its annual Best in Travel Awards.
Already notable to intrepid travellers for its mix of religions and cultures, its timeless temples, its rich and accessible wildlife, its growing surf scene and its people who defy all odds by their welcome and friendliness after decades of civil conflict, this is a country revived, says Lonely Planet author Ethan Gelber in the Best in Travel 2019 book published this week.
This is just the type of endorsement that Sri Lanka needs to bolster its tourism industry. Tourist visits to Sri Lanka have increased dramatically since the end of the 30-year conflict, from 447,890 in 2009 to an all time high of 2.1 million last year, a figure the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority hopes to double by 2020.
Renovations made to the rail system have opened up much of the North for the first time since 1990  an area previously considered too dangerous for tourists. The scenic rail routes in Sri Lanka are now thought to be some of the best in the world. Expressways are being built to cover much of the island and the number of domestic flight routes has increased. For example, it is now possible to fly from Colombo to Batticaloa in just 45 minutes, as opposed to 4-5 hours by road. We do need more affordable scheduled domestic flights, now that all domestic airports are being upgraded to international standards.
There has also been a huge investment in new visitor accommodation from home stays to high-end eco retreats. Major international hotel chains, including Shangri-La, Mvenpick, Sheraton, Next, Radisson SAS, Grand Hyatt, Ritz Carlton, Hilton, JW Marriott, Inter-Continental and ITC have either opened or are opening brand new properties. Sri Lanka needs more hotel rooms to accommodate four million tourists as envisaged in the short term.
The tourism industry must also work with the airline industry to address the impending shortage of seats into Colombo. The good news is that many new airlines are coming in to Colombo from this month including Aeroflot (Russia), SWISS/Edelweiss (Switzerland), Thomas Cook (UK), Thai Air Asia (Thailand), Vistara (India), Lion Air (Indonesia) and Biman (Bangladesh). Many existing airlines have also increased flights and capacity. But we need more airlines to come in to handle the extra traffic.
However, Sri Lanka must also be on guard against over-tourism. City fathers in destinations such as Venice, literally flooded with tourists, are wondering how to protect their treasures in the face of the tourist onslaught. Some countries have been forced to take drastic measures  one example comes from the Philippines which is opening its resort island Boracay to holidaymakers today after a six-month clean-up aimed at repairing the damage inflicted by years of unrestrained mass tourism.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte ordered the island to be shuttered in April to fortify weak infrastructure and crack down on the rampant overdevelopment that had left it a cesspool. When the doors are re-opened, Boracay will have fewer hotels and restaurants, a cap on the number of visitors and anti-beach boozing rules aimed at taming its reputation for partying hard. Indeed, sustainable tourism is a major challenge that Sri Lanka must face in order to ensure that its attractions are preserved intact for posterity.
Despite the priority given to inbound tourism, it would be nave to neglect local tourists, who kept the industry going during some of its darkest chapters in recent memory. Some tourist resorts are known to practice a form of apartheid against even well-heeled local tourists. Any hotels which engage in such practices should be named and shamed and their status should be downgraded. There should be more facilities for domestic tourists. Similarly, there should be a bigger emphasis on tourists from the SAARC region.
At a time when the Rupee is under pressure, the tourism industry which is a huge foreign exchange earner can be a major economic lifeline. The industry should be given all necessary incentives and concessions to realise its short-term and long-term goals.

Homes for affected residents
New homes were provided to illegal residents who live near the pipeline being constructed to carry fuel from Colombo Port to Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal, Kolonnawa.
The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminal is taking measures to lay a 12-inch new pipeline.
Homes were granted to 20 residents as the first step of the programme, under the patronage of Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga and Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayaka.
The minister said even though there is a court order to remove them, they have looked into this matter humanely, considering the welfare of the families. He assured that they will provide new homes to other residents too.
All of you lived on top of the pipeline. You lived on fire. If there was a fire in the pipeline, it would have created a disaster in Colombo.
Court issued an order to remove the people. If this was the previous regime, they would have kicked out all of you in one night.
But our government does not follow that kind of procedure.
We have taken steps to grant new homes to you for your well-being, the minister added.
This pipeline is about 70 years old. We cannot predict when it would leak and blast.
We could not lay a new pipeline for 20 years.
Now we can lay the pipeline without causing any injustice to residents, the minister added.
Parliamentarian Ravi Karunanayake said they will grant homes to the other 419 residents before the end of this year.

India to become worlds third largest  aviation market in 2024
New Delhi: India will become the worlds third largest aviation market around 2024 surpassing the UK, global airlines body IATA, as it projected total air passenger numbers to touch 8.2 billion in 2037.
Releasing the latest update to IATAs 20-year Air Passenger Forecast, the grouping also cautioned that growth prospects for air transport and the economic benefits driven by aviation could be curtailed if protectionist measures are implemented by governments.
The present trends in air transport suggest passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion in 2037, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said.
The Asia-Pacific region is projected to drive the biggest growth with more than half the total number of new passengers over the next 20 years coming from these markets.
The growth is being driven by a combination of continued robust economic growth, improvements in household incomes and favourable population and demographic profiles, it noted.
According to the IATA, China would displace the United States as the worlds largest aviation market in the mid-2020s.
Aviation market is defined in terms of traffic to, from and within a country, as per the grouping.
India will take 3rd place after the US, surpassing the UK around 2024. Indonesia is forecast to be a standout performer - climbing from the worlds 10th largest aviation market in 2017 to the 4th largest by 2030, it said.
IATA Director General and CEO Alexandre de Juniac said a doubling of air passengers in the next 20 years could support 100 million jobs globally, adding that it is seeing a geographical reshuffling of world air traffic to the East. Firstpost

Headline Inflation, as measured by the change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), which is compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), decreased to 0.9 per cent in September 2018, the lowest since January 2016, from 2.5 per cent in August 2018 on year-on-year basis.
The deceleration in year-on-year inflation in September was driven by both the base effect and the monthly decline in Food prices. The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis decreased from 4.7 per cent in August 2018 to 4.0 per cent in September 2018.
When the monthly change is considered, the NCPI decreased from 125.4 index points in August 2018 to 124.4 index points in September 2018 due to decline in prices of the items in the Food category, particularly that of vegetables, coconuts, green chillies and fresh fish. Meanwhile, price increases were observed in the Non-food category, particularly that of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco; Transport and Restaurants and Hotels sub-categories.

A letter to my daughters dog
While you are reluctant to accept my leadership, and you only keep me company when your real person is away, I thank you for being the best dog I have ever known.
Tail at only half-mast, you roly-polied your way over to my daughter the moment we sat down with your litter mates. You came to sniff, to take a gentle stroke, and replied with a soft lick of greeting. My daughter was 10, bereft after her mother had silently left in the night, taking her older sister along with her, never offering explanation or regret to the daughter left behind. Such a generous puppy you were, ready to listen, cuddle and play.
I was five when my father was killed, and my mother gave me a black kitten and took care to ensure he slept on my bed. I remembered the warmth and comfort of him when I saw my daughters misery. So I set out to find a puppy before the lawyers could put me into long-term debt.
You shed continuously all over the house, chewed shoes and wires and only answered one persons call. For my daughter, you were perfect. You obeyed commands with alacrity, waited patiently, brought a ball at every opportunity and house-trained almost immediately. My daughter realised that the way to your heart was via your stomach, and insisted on being the one who fed you.
Over the years of an acrimonious parental separation, you were steadfast in your love and appreciation. You gave my daughter your undivided attention, the security of knowing there was always at least someone who would listen to her and a sense of control over a part of her life. I credit you with a big role in developing a stable, thoughtful and kind young woman, who will go far.
My daughter is about to leave for university, while you have developed the severe hip dysplasia we knew was coming. Your end is inevitable, unavoidable and imminent. We are doing all we can to make your life as comfortable as possible. We owe you that, and so much more. I believe you know you are loved deeply and unconditionally, and you will let us know when it is time to go.
So, thank you for your generosity, patience, reliability and everything you have done. As my daughter steps out into the world, your spirit will go with her for the rest of her life.

Own a pet, reap benefits
Reduce stress and blood pressure.Pets provide unconditional love. They are always happy to greet you when you arrive home.
Criminals hate dogs. A dog is good personal security when you are out walking and good security for your home when you are not there.
Walking a dog will help keep you fit and active.Pets are a responsibility that give a since of purpose, boosting your feelings of self worth. If you are feeling inadequate, unsure, or not useful; a pet (any kind, turtle, cat, horse) will boost your feelings of self worth because they are counting on you for their care.
Need a date Walking a dog breaks all kinds of social communication barriers. Neighbors or strangers are much more likely to approach you and strike up a conversation about your dog when they see you out walking or at the dog park. So if you need a date borrow a dog and get outside, there is no telling who you may meet, maybe your future spouse.
Dogs can help clean your house. Drop a little popcorn on the floor, dont worry about it, your dog will clean up the crumbs in no time. I think that is why dogs and little kids are so great together. One creates lots of crumbs and the other cleans them up.
Studies have shown that heart attack patients who have pets survive longer than those without.
An Australian and German study found that people who own pets have fewer doctor visits. (Aust Social Monitor 2002; 4: 93-99). Saving you money and keeping you healthier.
Pets prevent you from being lonely. They are great to talk too even thou they dont talk back. Giving you someone to confide in who you know wont break a confidence.
Pets can provide you with a new social network. You will meet people with similar interests at the dog park, dog shows, and other neighbors when you are out walking your dog.
Alzheimers patients have fewer anxious outbursts if there is a pet in the house.

LTTE detainees cannot be identified as political prisoners - Thalatha
Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala said she does not identify the LTTE detainees as political prisoners and if there are any political prisoners, they are ready to interfere as a government.
Minister Athukorala was responding to the motion moved by MP Sumanthiran on PTA detainees yesterday at Parliament.
I do not deny that this happened on a political process. But we as the Justice Ministry have no power to release them. I do not identify them as political prisoners, neither do I consider them as LTTE terrorists, she said.
She did not comment on the detainees released under the previous government.
The Minister said thousands of cases are pending before the courts and hearing them delays.
The cases will not be delayed intentionally. We will minize delays. Around 30,000 cases are pending in high courts and a judge has to hear nearly 400 cases, she said.
Minister Athukorala said 54 cases are of attempting to kill. Six are Sinhalese, three Muslims and 45 Tamils. They have been accused of killing Lakshman Kadirgamar, attempting to kill former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, killing the late Former Minister Jayaraj Fernandopulle, attempting to kill Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, suicide bombers who killed 29 people including Maj. General Janaka Perera and passengers of a bus.
I cannot confirm whether they have political motive. They are punishable under the Penal Code. This is not against any individual under the PTA, she said.
She said 43 cases were concluded and punishments were given after proper hearing and they were given opportunities to present their evidence.
We intend to minimize delays irrespective of north or south. We will protect the independence of the judiciary and not ready to counter the orders. This is not targeting a set of individuals, she said.
The Minister said this problem will be resolved with humane approach
Release all detainees held under PTA  Sumanthiran
MP Sumanthiran, moving an adjournment motion on detainees in Parliament yesterday, requested the government to make a political decision to release all the prisoners held under the PTA without further legal action against them.
He said it was meaningless to incarcerate detainees under the PTA even after they spent over a decade in prisons.
He said the government is to replace the PTA with the Counter Terrorism Act. The Prevention of Terrorism of Act (PTA) was enacted in 1979 as a temporary legislation for six months. It was extended from time to time and eventually became permanent.
The MP said that several provisions of the PTA were left out in the new bill.
Several persons were arrested under the PTA over the last several decades and convicted. In most cases, suspects confessions to a police officer were the only or main evidence against them. Under the proposed new law, confessions are not counted as evidence. Over 100 persons are in prisons under PTA, he said.
He sad the Prevention of Terrorism Temporary Provisions Act is criticized by many people and organizations.
He said some clauses in the PTA are draconian; there is preventive detention for 18 months at a time, merely on suspicion and a detention order signed by the Defence Secretary.
A provision of the Act says that a confession by a suspect signed by an officer above the Assistant Superintend of Police is admissible as evidence in court. If the confession is challenged, proving that the confession was not voluntary is given to the accused. This provision is utterly unfair, he said.
MP Sumanthiran said that it was revealed that persons held were tortured to obtain confessions under the PTA and these confessions were challenged many a time. Many accused had told courts with medical evidence that they were tortured to get information.
Police officers did not investigate properly and obtain evidence to present in court. Persons under suspicion or on false information were apprehended and convicted when actual offenders roamed free, he said.
He said that these people were accused of waging a war against the government. Political objective of creating a separate State has come to an end in 2009 and it does not exist now.
This happened when an armed rebellion was in the country. People waged war against the government to form another government but that objective is no more. The Rajapaksa government released 12,000 people who fought against the government but the present government, we thought, would be more humane than the Rajapaksa government, but we do not see any progress, he said.
He requested Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala to ask the President to excise his power of granting pardon.
Speaker approves Office for Reparations Act
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced in Parliament yesterday that he gave his assent to the Office for Reparations Act.
The Act is to provide for the establishment of the Office for Reparations, to identify aggrieved persons eligible for reparations, and to provide individual and collective reparations to such persons.
It repeals the Rehabilitation of Persons, Properties and Industries Authority Act, No. 29 of 1987.
The legislation passed in to law in Parliament on October 10 with a majority of 16 votes following a division called by the Joint Opposition. It received 59 votes in favour and 43 votes against.
The Bill was moved for debate by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The five-member Office for Reparations has to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Constitutional Council (CC) as per the legislation.
The new office will be responsible in deciding the criteria for eligibility for aggrieved persons to obtain reparations and/or financial compensation, the quantum of reparations, and which body has pay them. Implementation of such policies on reparations and guidelines is subject to the approval by the Cabinet.
Dollar appreciation results in many global issues: Kabir Hashim
Highways and Higher Education Minister Kabir Hashim said Sri Lanka has very limited options as an emerging market to overcome the issues created by the dollar appreciation. He was addressing Parliament on the global issue of the Dollar appreciation.
The Minister said that many other countries are facing several issues as a result.
He said the government has taken several initiatives to improve and strengthen the economy. The Minister said that an 8 percent increase was in agriculture sector in 2017 and added domestic production is increasing.
Sea fish export has been increased compared to the increase in previous years. The sector contributes 100 per cent value addition. Foreign revenue has improved and we see increase in the number of tourists. Sri Lanka was rated as the top country for tourists to visit in 2019 by the Lonely Planet. We are competing with many global issues, he said. The Minister said that post April, the government did not change its path but it faced many global issues that depreciated the Sri Lankan Rupee.
Not only our country, several other countries had to face problems as a result. As a country, we have very limited option to counter these issues, he said. The Minister said Russias economic growth in 2017 was 1.7 per cent and Chile recorded 1.5 per cent while Australia 2.3 per cent. It was 1.3 per cent in Canada and 5.9 per cent in Malaysia while Singapore recorded 3.6 per cent economic growth, Korea recorded 3.1 per cent and Sri Lanka 3.4 per cent.
Even though many people point their fingers at the government that the economy has drained and there was no improvement, it is not true. There is a decrease in economic growth in many other emerging countries as a result of the global situation, he said. Many people accuse the government that taxes has been increased and public are facing several issues.
In 2009, under the former government, direct tax was 22 per cent and indirect tax was 77 per cent, in 2010, direct tax was 18 per cent and indirect tax was 81 per cent. In 2011, direct tax was 18 per cent and indirect tax was 81.4 per cent.
In 2014, direct tax was 18 per cent and indirect tax was 81.4 per cent, he said. The Minister said the government will increase the direct taxes from 18 per cent to 40 per cent and decrease the indirect tax from 82 per cent to 60 per cent.
No instability in State banks - Harsha
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Harsha de Silva said that there was no instability in the State-run Bank of Ceylon (BoC) and the Peoples Bank.
The Minister was responding to questions raised by MP Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday about the depreciation of Sri Lankan Rupee against the US dollar and that mismanagement and corruption have been taking place in the BoC and Peoples Bank.
Minister de Silva said the government will meet the challenges of the Rupee depreciation.
He said the Rupee depreciation and issues of State banks have no connection and said that all emerging markets are facing the issues created with the Dollar appreciation. MP Gunawardena claimed that the government is in power for the past three and half years making false promises to the people with all four budgets.
Initiatives have already been taken to restructure State banks to make them more efficient under the instructions given by the President. New boards of directors will be appointed for these institutions, he said.
He said the Banks Supervision Department of the Central Bank has to do an inquiry before changing chairmen and director boards of the State banks.
Sri Lankas largest ever Sovereign Bond issuance with a combined value of $ 2.5 billion was successfully concluded drawing widespread demand from global investors, he said.
He said the LIBOR interest rate was 0.5 per cent between 2008 and 2015 and many western stakeholders invested in emerging markets.
The LIBOR interest rate has been increased up to 3 per cent, he said.
State Minister De Silva said the BOI will improve foreign investment and Sri Lanka got more foreign investments in 2017.
BOIs goal is to increase the Foreign revenue to USD 5 Billion by 2020 and the highest recorded revenue was USD 1.9 Billion in 2017. In 2018, they are expecting to reach USD 2.5 Billion, he said.
He said that as the investment zones under BOI has reached its highest capacity, measures have been taken to set up three more investment zones in Hambantota, Milleniya and Bingiriya.
To strengthen the projects and quicken the procedures, single window investment facilitation task force will be set up. In 2018, USD 25 Million worth re- exports have been recorded apart from those investments, he said.
However, MP Gunawardana who raised the question, repeated that the president instructed to change the directors board as there was an mismanagement in State run banks and asked the government ministers not to hide it.
He said that as there are issues with the depreciation of rupee against the dollar immediate measures should be taken to solve them and added that a Parliament special committee has to be appointed to look into it.
Minister of Public Enterprise & Kandy City Development Lakshman Kiriella in response said that it has been recorded that BOC and Peoples bank are profitable.
According to the report by the Auditor General, there was no corruption or mismanagement taking place in those institutions.
A new board is appointed every three years, he said.
He said that former government appointed officer after checking on their horoscopes and added that it was not the same under the present government.
CC in favour of extending age limit of IC members
The Constitutional Council (CC) has been in favour of extending the term of members of the independent commissions (ICs) to a maximum age limit of 80 years.
The CC chaired by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya met at the Parliamentary complex yesterday. The Speakers Media Division in a press release said the CC discussed the appointments to the independent commissions for which the three-year term has ended. The term of the members of the Human Rights Commission, Public Service Commission and National Police Commission ended this month. The CC has proposed to reappoint the same members considering that those commissions have high level of efficiency at present.
A final decision in this regard will be made after a discussion with President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Speaker, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan are ex-officio members of the CC. Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe and JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake were appointed to the CC early this month, while its new Civil Society representatives are Dr. Jayantha Danapala, Ahmad Javid Yusuf and Naganathan Selvakkumaran.
PRECIFAC, Bond Commission reports: Fresh calls to resume debate
Fresh calls were in Parliament yesterday to resume the suspended debate on the PRECIFAC and Bond Commission reports.
The topic came to the fore when TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran raised a privilege issue asking the Speaker to take action against MP Bandula Gunawardena, the Island newspaper and the MTV TV for making false accusations that he (Sumanthiran) sabotaged the debate on the bond commission report.
Sumanthiran said the Island newspaper had quoted MP Gunawardena as saying that the debate had to be postponed as MP Sumanthiran demanded Sinhala and Tamil translations of the bond commission report. This is totally wrong. I did not ask for translated copies of the Bond report as it was the Party Leaders agreement to proceed with the debate if the English copy is available. What I pointed out was that the PRECIFAC report was only available in Sinhala and therefore our party members are unable to speak on it, he said.
The debate on the two reports was taken up on February 6, but it was postponed on February 20 until the House receives the English translation of the PRECIFAC report.
It came to light yesterday that Parliament was yet to receive the translated copies of the PRECIFAC report even after the lapse of eight months. MP Gunawardena urged the Speaker to resume the debate and UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake joined in the request. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the request would be discussed at a Party Leaders Meeting.
US sanctions on Iran may bring in fresh troubles - Eran
Sri Lanka may face fresh troubles when the Trump administration imposes more sanctions on Iran after November 5, Finance and Mass Media State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said.
The State Minister, opening the debate in Parliament yesterday on the Finance Bill and several Orders under the Excise (Special Provisions) Act, said the Government is in talks with its friendly countries to ensure the uninterrupted supply of oil to Sri Lanka.
The US imposed sanctions against Iran on August 28 and it would impose new sanctions on November 5. This impacts Sri Lanka as we depend on Iranian crude oil. We export tea to Iran and earn a considerable income. The US sanctions remains a challenge for Sri Lanka, the State Minister said.
He said Sri Lanka has had to negotiate a GSP plus trade concession with the UK as it no longer an EU member following the Brexit. He said the US-China trade war and the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) of the US also impact on Sri Lankan economy. He said the Sri Lankan Rupee depreciated by 11.9 per cent from January to October 21 mainly due to external reasons. The State Minister said the Indian Rupee depreciated by 15 per cent, and Pakistan Rupee by 21 per cent during the same period.

Sir Cyril de Zoysas 122nd birth anniversary falls today:
Personality imbued with merit and wisdom
I am now a free man. Ones affluence is not a matter of importance. Everything is delusive. I was born without wealth. I shall pass away without wealth. My peace, my joy, my strength lies in my philosophy  in the Dhamma to which I subscribe. This is a statement that Sir Cyril de Zoysa made in his twilight years. Contained within this is the truth and reality of life that every religion preaches.
Sir Cyril de Zoysa is no more. Although he is not physically present with us, his lifestyle was such that he left behind a generous bequest of examples for us to emulate. I have not seen Sir Cyril de Zoysa in the flesh and blood, but I have seen the services he has rendered to all and sundry. Through such services, I see him. I see him also through the lives of his family members who I know very closely. It was a close relationship that my father had with them. It is precisely because of this bond that my sisters, who were schooling at Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya and Holy Family Convent, Kalutara, stayed with Sir Cyrils sister in her home, at the outset, when they were admitted to schools in Colombo. As I write, thoughts come to mind of what my sisters said about Sir Cyrils sister and how she treated them with love and care in her home at Frazer Avenue, Dehiwela.
While he held the post of Chairman of the Urban Council (UC) in the 1940s, this particular sisters son, Kingsley Wickremasinghe, was later elected several times by popular vote as Chairman of the U.C. I recall how much he wished to engage in the development of the Kalutara town and to solve the problems faced by people who were suffering from housing problems, and how much effort he spent on this matter. This was the time when I was State Minister of Housing. I believe that his desire to ease the pain of the ordinary man, his forthrightness and the discipline he evinced are qualities he imbibed from the Cyril de Zoysa ancestry.
In the 1960s during the days of my youth, I have seen Sir Cyrils brother, Advocate V. T. de Zoysa, together with Queens Counsel A.C. Goonaratne visiting us - being in and out of our home. At this time the two of them were in charge of the management of the affairs of the UNP in the Kalutara District. In turn, my father too was in and out of their homes and their office. On many such occasions, I have joined my father. Carrying forward this bond to the next generation, it is a great joy that today, Ajita and Tilak de Zoysa, continue to maintain a strong bond with us. Today, these two nephews, Ajita de Zoysa, Chairman of the Kalutara Bodhi Trust and Tilak de Zoysa, the Secretary, are engaged in carrying forward effectively Sir Cyrils vision suitably adapted to meet the needs of the era.
It was during a time when for centuries, the native community was deprived of many of its fundamental rights as well as a sense of self-respect, that Cyril de Zoysa was born, these were times when patriotic Sri Lankan leaders were resolutely striving to save the native community from this impasse and bring them forth to the forefront. Young Cyril too followed this path, took on these responsibilities as though they were his own, and made his contribution at prime level. The Kalutara Bodhiya, Kalutara Vidyalaya and Balika Vidyalaya rank among the highest symbols of his contribution.
It is observed that patriotic heroes are born in different countries in different eras as though it were to help fulfil the needs of each such era. Sir Cyril de Zoysa may be deemed to be one such man of the era, born at the end of the nineteenth century in order to meet the needs of the 20th century. Born on October 26, 1896 in the District of Galle, educated at St. Thomas College, Matara, Richmond College, Galle, and Royal College, Colombo, he was admitted to the Ceylon Law College and then commenced his professional career in 1921 as a lawyer on the Balapitiya Bar. Later he moved to Kalutara where he achieved fame as a clever lawyer. There in the city of Kalutara did the golden age of his life dawn. A true son of the soil, he dedicated his life to the service of the people in the capacity of the Chairman of the Urban Council, a Member of the Senate and as The President of the Senate.
When he was a Law Student he conducted private tuition classes. With his savings, he bought a bullock cart and presented it to his father, who was hitherto dependent on a hired cart to travel to his office to practice his profession as a Notary. Thus did he evince the great quality of fending for ones parents.
Never did he lose his head when he received in his lifetime many official appellations, honours, positions and a knighthood. He simply used them in the service of the Sasana, his country and the community. However, many services he rendered, however many buildings he constructed, however many donations he made, never did he seek publicity by having his name carved in stone or displayed on name boards.
Sacred Bodhi Tree at Kalutara
Deeply touched by the depths to which the Sacred Bodhi Tree at Kalutara had fallen owing to neglect caused by the fact that the country had fallen into foreign hands, he gave leadership to the mission to develop the sacred place, broke through all obstacles in his way and constructed at his own cost a stand upon which devotees may place flowers etc., thereby making this an open place of worship. He had the Kachcheri (the Government Agents or GAs Office), the Residency (official residence of the GA) and the premises acquired, and a Chaitya built atop the hillock, so that the sacred precincts flanked that part of the main Colombo-Galle Road, by way of an Upper Compound and a Lower Compound with a Chaitya each on either side.
On another occasion when he was again deeply touched by the state of neglect into which sacred Buddhist premises had fallen, he removed forthwith the gold ring he wore in a finger in his right hand and made arrangements to cash it in order to renovate the place. He has made significant contributions towards Buddhist missionary activities in various countries and has also played a significant part in the restoration of the London Buddhist Vihara. Very significantly, he had a section of the Buddhist Vihara re-designed to form living space for Sri Lankan (then Ceylonese) students in London.
When the restoration of the Kiri Vehera at Kataragama had come to a standstill, Sir Cyril took matters in hand and within a brief period he completed the work of restoration, had the pinnacle placed atop the Dagoba, in traditional style, by the Prime Minister of the day, Dudley Senanayake. He had the road from Kataragama Devalaya to Kiri Vehera cleared and out of it made a beautiful path which connected the two religious centres, one to the other.
While Sir Cyril took the initiative in setting up the Moragalla Aaranya Senasanaya (hermitage), he was an unostentatious Buddhist who contributed much towards the development and progress of many Buddhist Temples. Some such were the Kande Viharaya at Alutgama, Gangarama Viharaya at Hunupitiya, Colombo, Jayasekhararamaya at Kuppiyawattta, Colombo, Bellanwila Viharaya, Vajirarama Viharaya at Bambalapitiya and the Saddharmalankara Pirivena at Pinwatta. The construction and donation of a hall in memory of his parents for the Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) when he was serving as its President, the construction of the YMBA building in Colombo Fort and the construction of Pilgrims Rests in Kataragama, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa, are among the many altruistic services he rendered.
Transport services
He started the Swarnapali Bus Company, which developed into the South Western Bus Company. He commenced a Kataragama-Colombo bus service so that a link between the Southern and Western Provinces was formed. Through this, he generated employment and gained much popularity. Soon, transport services were nationalized, and the Company taken over by the Government.
Unbowed, Sir Cyril built a factory for the Associated Group of Companies on a vast tract of land in Palatota, Kalutara, to commence the production of hitherto imported tyres and tubes and to build a tyre retreading facility; also factories to produce batteries and for the local production of refrigerators of the Sisil brand. With such foresight, he created the circumstances under which the steady flow of exchange to other countries was arrested thereby ensuring vast savings for the country. This way he also generated employment opportunities for thousands of people. He did not forget his native village of Balapitiya where he commenced a power loom textile weaving factory thereby generating employment for many fellow villagers.
It has never been known that he tried to have the Christian Church which is located next to the Bodhiya premises removed or to cause any inconvenience to the Church, at any time. As a good Buddhist, living a life in accordance with the Buddhist philosophy, this may be cited as a fine example of treating all religions with respect.
May I conclude this piece of writing with a quotation from the Subhashita Kavyaya authored by the erudite poet, Alagiyawnna Mukavati.
Fruitless it is to have sired a hundred sons of scant merit. One lone son of character, wisdom and power would suffice to command the highest respect.
Sir Cyril de Zoysa was a son of the soil of Sri Lanka, imbued with merit and wisdom; he earned the love and respect of all; he brought credit to Mother Lanka; he was indeed a rare human being. Today we live in an era which is in desperate need of sons in the image of Sir Cyril.

Politics, theory and practice
The attempts being made by the Joint Opposition under the leadership of the Kurunegala District Member of Parliament Mahinda Rajapaksa to topple the current Yahapalana government appears to be a never ending fiasco. The move is not a new thing. It was launched when the Yahapalana government was formed after the general election held in 2015. Since then little more than three years have lapsed but no government had been toppled and the Yahapalana government continues to remain in power though politically it appears to be very weak and feeble due to the ongoing power struggle between its two main partners the United National Party and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party.
It is clear that the Joint Oppositions endeavour to topple the government is nothing more than imaginary verbose rhetoric. Hence, two conclusions can be drawn out of this political scenario. The Yahapalana government will remain in power until it completes the full five year official term which is due to end in August 2020. Secondly, even though the Yahapalana government is currently in such a dire situation, the Joint Opposition will not be able to topple it and capture the power even with the support of the so called group of 16 which is composed of the 16 SLFP parliamentary members who deserted the government after voting against the Prime Minister at the no-confidence motion brought in April this year.
An important question arises in this context. Why has the Joint Opposition failed in its attempt to topple the Yahapalana government and capture power though the Joint Opposition sounds so vociferous and confident in saying it has the ability to do so Answer to this question is very simple. It is because of the unawareness and ignorance of the Joint Opposition about the difference between talking politics and doing politics.
Struggle for power
Talking politics is something that anybody can engage in irrespective of the knowledge and understanding which is required for engaging in politics scientifically. For doing politics one has to learn in a systematic manner about how to do the game of politics or engage in the struggle for power. That is why it is said that talking politics and doing politics are entirely two different things and doing politics with no knowledge about real politics will abruptly fail and end up in an utter mess. This is the most important lesson that the politicians of the Joint Opposition have not yet learnt even though they are vigorously engaged in doing politics aiming at toppling the Yahapalana government.
What does an overturning or toppling a government in a democratic political system mean Toppling a government means nothing other than removing or expelling the executive from exercising state power before the expiry of the full official term assigned to it by the constitution. But there is no one unified method to topple a government and the method adopted for this purpose varies from government to government depending on the nature of the executive and procedures adopted in relation to the appointment and the removal of the executive from power. In modern democratic governments there are three different means of carrying out the executive power as Cabinet, presidential and semi-presidential.
In a Cabinet system of government the executive, also known as the real executive is the prime minister and the Cabinet which is elected from the members of the majority party of the legislature which may be either bicameral or unicameral. Toppling of the government means the removal of the incumbent Prime Minister and the Cabinet from the office by a no-confidence motion adopted in the House of Representatives with a simple majority. This is the only means available to topple a government in a Cabinet system. If the no-confidence motion is adopted, the incumbent executive has to resign from the respective portfolios and then the nominal executive has to make arrangements for the appointment of a new government.
In a situation like this, the nominal executive has two options. First of which is the dissolution of the House of Representatives and go for a fresh election to elect a new government. If the nominal executive decides so, the incumbent Cabinet turns into a caretaker government and is expected to handle the day- to-day affairs of government until the next government is elected. The second option is to invite the Opposition to form a government for the balance period left by the former government. This kind of government is not considered as a caretaker government and it is free to enjoy and exercise powers vested in the executive by the constitution. This is the usual method used to topple the government in a Cabinet system.
The method to expel the executive known as the president from power in a presidential system of government is not the same as the method used in the Cabinet system of government as mentioned above. To remove an incumbent President from office what ought to be done is to adopt an impeachment. Again the technical process involved with this device may also vary from one presidential government to another as different presidential systems have adopted different procedures with regard to the adoption of an impeachment. The classic example which can be cited in this regard is the impeachment procedure adopted in the American presidential system.
Presidential executive systems
In America an incumbent president can be removed from the office only by an impeachment which according to the constitution has to be initiated by the House of Representatives. It finally has to be adopted by the Senate with the absolute 2/3 majority of the total number of members of the Senate. If the incumbent president is removed then the vice-president is appointed to the office to run the government for the balance period left by the former president. This means that the removal of a president from the office does not amount to a total change of the government or it is not considered as overturning the government. It is just only a change of the person holding the office of the president and nothing more than that.
The third mode of the modern executive system is the semi-presidential or the quasi-presidential system in which the composition of the executive is much more complicated compared to the Cabinet and presidential executive systems. In a quasi-presidential system the executive is made up of combining some features drawn from the Cabinet and presidential executive systems. As such the executive branch of the quasi-presidential system is composed of a president directly elected by voters for a fixed term of office and a prime minister and Cabinet elected from among the members of the legislature which may be either unicameral or bicameral.
This second part of the executive e.g. the prime minister and Cabinet can also hold the office for the official term stipulated in the constitution. Likewise the methods of removing the two parts of the executive are also different. The method to remove the upper part of the executive, the president, through the adoption of an impeachment by the legislature with an absolute majority while the method to remove the lower part of the executive e.g. prime minister and Cabinet is the adoption of a no-confidence motion by the legislature with a simple majority. Thus toppling or overturning the government in the context of a semi-presidential system involves with the removal of both parts of the executive e.g. the president and the prime minister and the Cabinet. This is not an easy task as two different methods have to be adopted at two different levels. This is the most complicated and the most difficult procedure with regards to the toppling of a government compared to the methods used in the Cabinet and presidential system to remove the executive from the power.
Under the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka, the governmental system introduced is a quasi-presidential system of government, where the executive is composed of two parts as the president and the prime minister and Cabinet. The president is directly elected by people for a period of five years (according to the 19th Amendment) and can be removed from office only by an impeachment adopted by the parliament. The impeachment process stipulated in the 1978 Constitution is the most complicated and the most difficult procedure in the world to accomplish as it involves getting the 2/3 absolute majority thrice if the motion is to get through.
Apart from this the Supreme Court also is involved in the process at one stage or another as it has been vested with power to examine the charges made against the president stated in the impeachment motion. Under this complicated procedure the removal of the president from the office is a mere dream which can be never realized. On the other hand the removal of the lower part of the executive e.g. the prime minister and the Cabinet can be done only by a no-confidence motion adopted by the parliament for which only requires a little more than half of the total number of the members of the parliament e.g. 113. Again this is an uphill task which cannot be brought into a reality under the existing multi-party system.
Vociferous and boisterous statements
This is the nature of the government that the Joint Opposition led by Mahinda Rajapaksa along with the group of sixteen is trying to topple. The quasi-presidential government, as explained above, is the most difficult government among the three modes of executives being practiced in the present world to be toppled. It is not easy as making vociferous and boisterous statements regarding the toppling of the government. The Joint Opposition and the group of 16 has no ability to muster the 2/3 absolute majority and the 113 simple majority to topple the whole government at once or at least to topple the government partially by removing one of the executives e.g. the president or the prime minister and the Cabinet.
The main strategy of the Joint Opposition and the breakaway group of 16 to topple the government is to exert pressure on President Maithripala Sirisena and other 23 members presently aligned with the government to withdraw from the coalition. Suppose if President Maithripala Sirisena and the 23 members oblige to the pressure and resign from the government what will happen then Nothing will happen to the government and it will pave the way for Ranil Wckremesighe to become president and form a UNP government with a UNP prime minister. If 23 members leave the government leaving President Maithripala Sirisena alone in the government then he will have to work with a sole UNP led government till his term expires. Even if those 23 members leave the government, it will be difficult for the Joint Opposition and the group 16 to muster the required number of 113 at least to remove a part of the government from the power.
From all these facts mentioned above it is clear that toppling the Yahapalana government is not as easy as the JointOpposition and group of 16 contemplate. With regard to the overturn of the government, they can only make vociferous and boisterous statements that have no practical value at all. What is evident from this is the poverty of the knowledge of the politicians representing the Joint Opposition about real politics. It seems that their knowledge about the difference between talking politics and doing politics is nil. So long as they limit their endeavour to topple the government through fancy verbose rhetoric, the Yahapalana government will continue in power until it reaches its natural death when it completes its full term in 2020.

Post GSP+ exports to EU up 18%
After receiving GSP plus in May 2017, Sri Lankan exports have increased by 18% to EU, said Ambassador of European Union (EU) to Sri Lanka and Maldives Tung-Lai Margue was at the National Chamber (NCCSL) hosted event.
GSP plus status has the greatest impact on the Sri Lankas apparel exports, which accounts for approximately 60% of the countrys exports to EU market. said Tung-Lai Margue. He further said that Sri Lanka should have this facility until 2023. One of the key aspects highlighted by him was to diversify the export base and also to diversify the service exports. Encourage new products for export rather than the traditional products to widen your market, he said.
However the exports are far behind with only 8%. The Ambassador said that he would believe that there will be improvements in the future, since the country received the GSP plus facilities only last year.
The European Union been a reliable and trustworthy trademark, is the largest single trade market accounting for 16.5% of the worlds imports and exports. This allows developing countries to open their markets for 500 million consumers over the European Union. It follows trade deals with 70 countries around the globe, representing 40% of Worlds GDP (Gross Domestic Product).
The EU  Sri Lanka has a long lasting economic trade. It is Sri Lankas second largest trading partner next to India.
The important outcome of the EU Sri Lanka trade relations is the development of the national export strategy to the country. The country should increase its exports and investments to develop its economy and be a part of open economy. Accounting for the promising features of the country; location and professionally skilled workforce, an attractive market needs to be built for investments.
Beyond GSP plus, we will be favoring Sri Lankan exports. The Ambassador further insisted businessmen to take full advantage of the GSP plus since many exporters are not taking full benefit of the scheme.
Suggestions were brought forth by businessmen present at the meeting to bridge the connection between manufacturers and clients as well as to share technology among manufacturers. Along with National Chamber of Commerce projects are initiated to educate businessmen on getting green certificate for their products and services. Steps will also be taken to support certification barriers within the EU.

Prof. Terrence Perera visits Sri Lanka
A leading academic, researcher and consultant, Professor Terrence Perera, recently visited Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) to be the keynote speaker at the Universitys International Research Conference. Professor Perera also conducted a new technology introduction workshop at MAS Holding and a research workshop at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura.
Professor Perera of Sheffield Hallam University, UK, boasts a wealth of knowledge and experience in Logistics and Supply Chain Management, Manufacturing Systems Engineering, and Modelling and Simulation. As an active researcher, he has been successful in delivering high-profile research programs in collaboration with industry. His research work focuses on addressing challenges in the deployment of simulation technologies and exploring novel applications for simulation. His current research work includes; developing a simulation enabled framework to enhance the performance of supply chains, developing a simulation based strategy to improve pharmaceutical supply chains and the deployment of simulation in the healthcare sector.
The Professor conducted a total of four sessions that were all centered around Industry 4.0. A concept developed by the German Government, Industry 4.0 is now seen as the answer to the challenge faced by many companies to be more agile and responsive in their functioning, especially where customers are concerned. The concept advocates the use of state-of-the-art digital technologies to create highly flexible systems. Industry 4.0 is considered to be the fourth industrial revolution. At the core, it presents several interconnected digital technologies. Some technologies are already fairly known, for example Big Data Analytics and Cyber Security.
Some are fairly new; Internet of Things (IoT), as an example. These technologies together are expected to make radical changes in industry. The purpose of Industry 4.0 is not to get rid of people, but to develop smart systems where machines and people can work in harmony. Does Sri Lanka need Industry 4.0 The short answer is yes, if its industries wish to remain competitive in global markets. Naturally, high-tech solutions require significant up-front investment, hence the most sensible approach would be to craft an individual Industry 4.0 journey.
The two-day conference at KDU saw Professor Perera conduct a highly informative session. Although the keynote was focused on the use of Big Data analytics, the professor argued that Industry 4.0 could take current digital transformation projects further forward with many exciting outcomes, for example, smart cities. A visit to the Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa (ITUM) in Diyagama, provided an opportunity to interact with future technologists who were very keen to learn how Industry 4.0 could be used in engineering applications.

Ravi complains of drone operating over his house
UNP MP Ravi Karunanayake complained in Parliament yesterday that a drone was unlawfully hovering over his house.
He asked Speaker Karu Jayasuriya as to whether permission had been given to operate a drone camera in the High Security Zone near the Parliament complex where his house is located.
The Speaker replied that he had not given such permission and said that he would direct the Police to investigate the matter. MP Karunanayake said that the individual who operated the drone camera identified himself as a media person.
His equipment and recordings are now with me.
I suspect this is another move to assassinate my character. This individual gives various false excuses and I urge the Speaker to probe into this matter and reveal who is behind this act, said Karunanayake also expressing his lack of confidence on the Police investigations into it.
MP Karunanayake also complained of being selectively targetted during the Bond issue.The debate on the Bond Commission report was suspended heaping the blame on one or two individuals, while many others should have been named. The Speaker replied that it was the Attorney Generals advice not to table the sections which may have an impact on the on-going legal proceedings. However, he promised to take up this matter at a Party Leaders Meeting yesterday.

Urban Development Authority completes 40 years:
Right investment in land
The Urban Development Authority was established 40 years ago to manage urban growth in Sri Lanka. It was born with the certification of the Urban Development Authority Law No.41 of 1978 on September 6, 1978. This new Law which provided for an innovative new agency to promote integrated planning and the implementation of economic, social and physical development of urban areas in Sri Lanka was a landmark legislation. This Law, for the first time focused on the integrated development of urban areas rather than on mere physical planning hitherto practiced by the Town & Country Planning Department.
The new Government, which came into power in 1977, launched an unprecedented development effort removing controls that pervaded public life till then and focused on the creation of a liberalized economy and the promotion of private sector participation. This development and modernization initiative had a heavy focus on three priority subject areas:
a) The Mahaweli Development Programme
b) The Free Trade Zone
c) The Housing & Urban Development Programme
Ranasinghe Premadasa, who took over as the Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction of the new Government was entrusted with the planning and implementation of the key Housing & Urban Development Programme, addressed the task entrusted to him under the new economic initiative, with vision, fortitude and vigour. The new Minister, who was also the Prime Minister of the country, was convinced that the new Governments vision of development and modernization cannot be carried forward without establishing a new legislative and institutional framework for both housing and for urban development. He was the first to take cognition of the possible impacts of urbanization in the country and gave priority to the management of urban growth. He had prepared himself whilst still in the opposition to launch a novel and an innovative human settlements development effort to meet the impending challenges.
The task of preparing the new legislation and the establishment of a new institutional and legislative framework became the responsibility of a core-team led by the Secretary to the Ministry, R Paskaralingam. The other key members were K H J Wieyadasa, Additional Secretary Dustan Jayawardane, National Housing Commissioner Neville Gunarathna, Colombo Master Plan Project Director and Author T Row, Colombo Master Plan Project UN Expert Dissa Weerapana and I, who formed the Planning Division in the Ministry, were the junior members of this team and were tasked with providing support and co-ordination services. This team, built upon the preliminary work already initiated by Neville Gunarathna and Auther Row in the Colombo Master Plan Project in formulating the UDA Law, as well as in planning a radical development in the City of Colombo.
Town planners
With the promulgation of the UDA Law, a new Chairman and a Board of Management had to be appointed and the office of the new Authority had to be established. Ministry Secretary R. Paskaralingam was appointed as the Chairman of the Authority, reflecting the high importance attached to the new institution by the Prime Minister. Neville Gunarathne one of the greatest town planners ever in Sri Lanka, and who had conceived the Colombo Master Plan, was expected to take up the vital post of General Manager of the new Authority. But the unassuming professional he was, Neville declined to assume managerial responsibilities, but preferred concentrate of his professional work and to lead the physical planning team. I, then Director of Planning in the Ministry was unexpectedly harnessed by Secretary Pasakaralingam to take over as the General Manager of the new institution. I was tasked with initial tasks if formulating the organisational structure of the institution, obtaining nominations of Board Members, convening the first Board meeting and establishing the office of the Authority as well as initiating the vesting of identified state lands with the UDA. The General Manager, in terms of the Law, becomes a member of the Board as well as its Secretary. (The designation of General Manager has subsequently been changed to Director-General)
My most immediate task was the establishment of the office of the Authority. It was established at the office of the Colombo Master Plan Project at No.47, D.R. Wjewardana Mawatha, Colombo 10, and subsequent arrangements were made to shift the Town and Country Planning Department, which was in occupation of a part of the same premises.
The Board of Management with R. Paskaralingam as the Chairman was indeed a high profile one. The new Board had Additional Secretary to Ministry of Local Government Housing and Construction K H J Wjeyadasa who later rose to top post in the public service of the Secretary to the President, Lands Ministry Secretary Nanda Abeywickrama, Industries Ministry Additional Secretary S C Manikkavasagar, Treasury Deputy Secretary K Shanmugalingam, Ceylon Transport Board General Manager Wimal Premaratne, Town and Country Planning Director Newton Wijesinghe, National Housing Development Authority Chairman Dustan Jayawardana (who later became the Chairman of the UDA itself and Air Lanka subsequently), Archeology Commissioner Roland de Silva, Educational Buildings Director K C Samaraweera and myself the General Manager. The first meeting of the new Board of Management of the UDA was held on October 26, 1978; a simple working meeting without any fanfare or publicity, at the new offices of the Authority.
The most onerous task with the launching the UDA was the determination of its organisational structure and placing suitable and experienced personnel to man the vital positions within the structure. The Colombo Master Plan Projector and even the Development of Town and City Planning had been manned mainly by Town Planners whose expertise was mostly in the conceptualizing and preparing physical development plans. They formed the core of the planning team in the Authority, working directly under Neville Gunaratne, who carried the designation of Additional General Manager.
Those first posts of Directors in the physical planning Division came to be filled by Edmund Dharma Siriwardane, Tissa Balankulama and N D Dickson; all experienced Town Planners from the Master Plan Project. But there were other vital positions to be filled and suitable persons, with the correct attitude and the capability to keep in step with the Prime Ministers relentless drive and energy, had to be identified and induced to come over to the new institution. Bandu Abeysundara of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service and a former Director of Laksala was appointed as the Director of Administration of the new institution while P Sivasubranminum, an experienced accountant from the Treasury took over as the Director of Finance. P. Wadugedara, a senior Superintendent of Surveys was made the Director in charge of Lands and Property, while S M Banduseela formed the Colombo Master Plan Project took-over as the Director of Information Systems.
Development projects
When the UDA was subsequently entrusted with the development of the Capital City of Sri Jayewardenepura and the construction of the new Parliament, Micheal Joachim, an experienced and innovative engineer from the Housing Department, was persuaded to take over as the Director of Engineering Services, while Lalith Muthukumarana was hand-picked by Neville Gunerathna, as the Sri Jayewardenepura Project Architect. A new division was established to cover special development projects of commercial importance with Elmo de Silva, an experienced private-sector Architect, as the Director, while a Slum and Shanty Division to address upgrading and improvement needs of urban low-income settlements especially in the City of Colombo was created within the planning division with Easwaran Selvarajah as its Assistant Director. When the Government decided to hand over the management of all Local Authority Rest Houses to the UDA, a Rest House Management Division was formed with K. M. Punchi Nilame as the Director and Kusumsiri Amarasinghe as the Deputy Director. They together with the Chairman and the General Manager formed the core management team of the UDA during those early days.
The first mega urban development project to be undertaken for implementation by the UDA was the Echelon Square Project in Colombo. The preliminary designs for the project had been already prepared under the Master Plan by George Kostritsky, a reputed Architect from the USA, who had designed the redevelopment of the derelict Harbour front of Baltimore City. The UDA under the directions of Neville Gunarathna finalized these plans and launched its implementation, with the lease of the identified development sites. The first land lot ever leased by the UDA was to be from the Echelon Square to the Bank of Ceylon, for its Head Quarters.
When the Government decided to establish a new Administrative Capital in Sri Jayewardenepura and to build the Parliament in the new Capital City, the task of implementing this decision was entrusted to the Urban Development Authority. This was an enormous responsibility which required close coordination and monitoring with a whole host of high profile actors, and several state agencies. I recollect the first inspection made of the proposed development area by a small team led by Secretary Paskaralingam, which included Neville Gunarathna, Author Row, Dakshitha Thalgadapitiya, the Chairman of the Reclamation Board and me. We drew-up at the then culvert on the road to Battaramulla (replaced by the present blue coloured bridge) and could not proceed beyond through the marsh. The Reclamation Board later constructed a temporary bridge from the Pita Kotte end of the marsh to approach the Duwa island which has been selected as the venue for the Parliament Building. The team led by Neville Gunarathna prepared the physical plan for the development of the Capital City, while the designing of the Parliament building itself was entrusted to Geoffrey Bawa, the world renowned Sri Lankan Architect. The Mitsui Company of Japan was awarded the contract for the construction of the Parliament Building with the UDA as the client agency. I recollect the weekly monitoring and trouble-shooting meetings chaired by Secretary Paskaralingam which was held at the then Ministry of Local Government, Housing & Construction at Transworkers House in Fort, where he had to deal with the varying demands of the several highly motivated actors in the project; the inimitable Geoffry Bawa and the meticulous Mitsui officials led by their Site Engineer Isoyama on the one hand, and a host of high level state officials on the other. Most demanding amongst them I recollect were, Daksitha Thalgodapitiya Chairman of Reclamation Board, Madugalle, General Manager of the Water Board Tudor Gunawardana, Denzil Senanayaka and RSA Peiris, from the Highways, Poolgasunderen from the Architects, M.L Victor, General Manager of the Ceylon Electricity Board, B. Ferdinandez, Director of Land Development and A. Shanmugaraja Director of Telecommunications. I had to keep notes of those meetings and take immediate follow-up action. Meanwhile, Wadugedara, the UDA Director of Lands had an unenviable task to identify and acquire all empty and unused lands around the Parliament site, which included surveying, and initiating acquisition procedures. The lands acquired included the present sites of office complex as well as the site of the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital.
With the Governments decision to shift public office buildings in Colombo to the new Capital City, the UDA was also entrusted with the construction of two multi-stored office complexes: the Sethsiripaya in Battaramulla and the Isurupaya in Pelawatta. A publication by the UDA Sri Lankas New Capital: Sri Jayewardenepura identifies all proposed developments to be established in the new Capital. In addition to the Parliament building, the new Hospital and administrative complexes, a Diplomatic enclave, a Sports Stadium, National Police Head Quarters, Open University, Cultural Center, and Bird Park had been identified. This plan has gone to this extent of identifying even the varieties of trees to be planted.
Among the other significant projects during the early period that the UDA managed were the construction of the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium, which had to be completed before the SAF games and the Superior courts complex in Hultsdorf. Prasana Gunawardana who was then Additional General Manager and who later become Chairman of the UDA itself and subsequently an assumed the exalted position of Lord Mayor of Colombo was the Project Manage for both these nationally important developments.
The Urban Development Authority, since establishment, has given birth and nurtured several other important state institutions as well. The Institute of Construction Industry Training and Development (now CIDA) commenced as a World Bank funded project under the UDA. The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) started as a branch of the UDA. The Sugathadasa Stadium Board and Management, which managed the Sugathadasa Outdoor, Sugathadasa Indoor and R. Premadasa Cricket Stadium was first established as a Committee of the Urban Development Authority, with the Prime Minister himself as the Chairman. I acted as the Committees Secretary.
The role played by the Urban Development Authority, in the nations development during its forty year history has been quite significant. This vital role is one that, the UDA can be proud of. This institution has changed the landscape of our premier City and has had a great impact on the country and the people. It developed a new administrative capital out of an abandoned marsh. It has continuously addressed the emerging issues of urbanization in the country. I am proud to have been associated with its birth and with its infant days. I wish to salute all those key members of the early UDA team who are no longer with us today: especially Neville Gunarathna, Dunston Jayawardana, Micheal Joachim, P Sivasubraminum, P. Wadugedara, Tissa Bulankkulama and Kusumsiri Amarasinghe.
(W D Ailapperuma is a career public servant who was the first General Manager of the Urban Development Authority.) He later served as the Chairman of the National Housing Development Authority, Chairman of the Central Environmental Authority and subsequently as the Secretary of the Ministry of Urban Development, Housing and Construction)

SLC terminates hospitality partner for breaking law
Sri Lanka Cricket states in a media release that following a decision made by the Executive Committee in February, 2018, SLC appointed Classic Destinations Private Limited as the hospitality partner for the Nidahas trophy and the England tour of Sri Lanka.
Accordingly, the company was entitled to, at its sole cost and expenses to provide and or supply Hospitality Services (including food and related care) to the spectators procured by the company for such Corporate Boxes with no involvement of Sri Lanka Cricket.
In that context, in the exercise of the rights granted to the company, it shall be duty bound to act within the laws of the country by procuring and obtaining relevant licenses and or permits as required by law for the services to be offered by the company to its spectators.
As the firm has failed to act within the law; as found following a raid by the Department of Exercise during the 5th ODI between Sri Lanka and England at the RPICS; and bringing disrepute to Sri Lanka Cricket, SLC has decided to immediately terminate Classic Destination from delivering further hospitality services during the England tour.
Sri Lanka Cricket will handle the corporate boxes in the upcoming matches to ensure that spectators will not face any inconvenience.

Mango trees which suit the specific climatic condition of each district were selected from plant nurseries and distributed to the islandwide dealer network by the company. To ensure sustainability, each dealer took up the responsibility to maintain the tree until it was stable and the trees were planted in places such as Schools, Religious places, Government Officers, Police Stations and dealer premises. The tree planting project was coordinated by the Stafford Green Leaders Association while the senior management and staff of Stafford Motors participated at the event.
The sponsorship was provided by Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation covering the main ceremony in Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala. CSR projects of this nature which are initiated by the Stafford Green leaders will help to protect the environment while making a greener Sri Lanka.

SUNIL GUNEWARDANE was like a 'BOLT' on track
That was the era when men and women athletes from little known schools stole the limelight from their counterparts from the Metropolis, with their phenomenal deeds on the track and field in athletics.
During that reign, SUNIL GUNEWARDENE took the scene by storm. He worked wonders on the track and left his opponents far behind physically and emotionally. That we remember him to this day speaks to the SPORTS LEGEND he was.
SUNIL BENEDICT GUNEWARDANE, from the time he put on spikes as a schoolboy at St.Marys, Chilaw showcased talents. He was an athlete of international class. Coaches and connoisseurs who watched his dazzling bolting on the track predicted a bright future for him. And he did not disappoint them.
Born in Bandarawatta
GUNEWARDANE was born on October 6 in Bandarawatta, Kaakkapitiya. His father was Joseph Gunewardane and mother Harriot. His father was a landed proprietor. SUNIL was the second in a family of six.
In the pre GUNEWARDANE era athletes from rural areas who shone on the track and reached great heights to mention a few were the Khan bothers  A.S.M and A.L.M, Linus Diaz and R.J.K.Karunananda. The above mentioned four were long distance wonders.
Of the foursome the man who brought great credit to the country was Karunananda running in the Tokyo Olympics marathon. He did not make waves for winning the event, but for a different reason.
Guts and determination
Karunananda had the guts and determination to finish the course long after the event was over.
The big crowd at the Stadium stood up to him and cheered him all the way to the tape in appreciation in not giving up but finishing the course. Athletes and followers of that sport in that era still remember that great moment.
GUNEWARDANE when under starters would take off like a jet and flew in the style of the modern day Jamaican Usain Bolt and would not look back until he breasted the tape well ahead of his opponents.
Whenever it was known that GUNEWARDANE was going to be on the track there would be big crowds to watch his heroics and he seldom let them down. He had a brilliant burst of speed and what was amazing was that he maintained that pace right up to the tape.
Monumental success
His monumental success on the track did not make him lose his unassuming and simple ways. He got on with everyone especially his opponents and was ever ready to proffer advice to the young and up and coming athletes.
GUNEWARDANE hugged the track so much so that records he set up remained unbroken believe it or not for 25,32 and 37 years. Athletes and sports fans of that era still talk about this feat. He showed talent as a schoolboy and was crowned the All Island champion in 1968.
In a meet in Thailand with his wife to be K.G.Badra also making waves in the womens scene, GUNEWARDANE stunned the packed stands at that meet by becoming the first Sri Lankan schoolboy to bag the 100 metres event in less than 10 seconds.
Young gazelle
Having watched the young gazelle performing wonders, athletes of an earlier era in their schools - St.Peters College and St.Josephs College  Carlton Seneviratne and Harry Jayawardene told me, when I began my journalistic career at Times of Ceylon in the early 1960s to watch the gazelle who was going to set up records on the track that will not be easily equaled or broken. And GOONEWARDANE lived up to their expectations.
Carlton and Harry were Sports Editors of the DAILY NEWS and DAILY MIRROR. In poking a little fun, Seneviratne once told me that whenever there was an athletic meet on his school grounds in Bambalapitiya records tumbled in all most all events.
When asked why with a loud guffaw he would say because the athletes were running away from the stench that emanated from the canal adjoining the ground. It was hilarious. It is appropriate to recall that perennial by MARY HOPKINS - Those were the days my friend.
The golden era
That was also the golden era when there were a galaxy and exemplary sports writers from whom one could learn and to mention them  A.V.Fernando, Percy Beling and M.B.Marjan of the TIMES, guest writer M.V.Muhsin. Lawford Martinus, Premnath Moraes and Austin Daniel DAILY MIRROR, M.M. Thowfeek, Bertie Wijesinha, Eustace Rulach, Stanley Wickremasuriya, J.E.M Garnier, T.M.K.Samat and A.C. de Silva OBSERVER, Christie Seneviratne and N.E.Thangaraja DAILY NEWS. Cream of sports journalists with lofty ideals.
Coming back to GUNEWARDANE, it was that 100 metre win tat shot him to stardom. His school record of 10.9 secs in the 100 metres and 21.65 secs in the 200 metres stood the test of time for 32 and 37 years respectively. Not satisfied with that he continued his brilliance and set up Sri Lankan records in both the 100 metres  10.5 secs  and the 200 metres in 21.7 secs.
Remarkable
And what was remarkable and memorable was that he set up these records on his 21st birthday on October 6, 1970. His 100 metres record stood for 25 years. GUNEWARDANE, at the Munich Olympics in Munich in 1972 ran the 200 metre event in 21.31 secs which was Asias fastest timing. That record lasted for 18 years.
Then he achieved further success by winning the gold medal by finishing the 4 x 400 m. in 3 mins 7 secs at the Teheran Asian Games. Then GUNEWARDANE had the good fortune of a two week course in sprinting and hurdles in 1987 in Indonesia. He followed a similar course under Charles Taylor the famous British coach in the UK in 1991.He was also a recipient of a two week special course with Jackie Joyner Kerser the world record holder in Bejing in 2007.
Saying goodbye
Saying goodbye to the track on which he dominated he took to administration.He took on the role of coach and manager of the Sri Lanka Athletic team and in 2000 was the chef-de-mission at the Olympic Games. He was President of the Sri Lanka Athletic Association and Vice President of the National Olympic Committee in 2001.
GUNEWARDANE gave to the game what he got from it by coaching promising and up and coming athletes and at times helping them financially too. When S.B.Dissanayake was the Minister of Sport that athletics in the country hit the big time and supporting and helping the Minister was GUNEWARDANE as Co-ordinating Secretary.
With his expert coaching he turned out many national and international athletes among them were  Damayantha Darsha, Rohan Pradeep Kumara, Mahesh Perera, Tania Van Heer and Ranga Wimalawansa.
Produced champions
He also produced Commonwealth and Asian Games champions in Prasanna Amerasekersa, Ashok Jayasundara, Nayanthi Kumara, Rohitha Pushpakumara, Shivantha Weerasuriya, Prdeep Herath and Sujani Buddhika.
The game of athletics, athletes and those who watched his magic on the track will always remember and admire him. The likes of GUNEWARDANE will not unwind again.

Tragic Durham rugby players deaths in Sri Lanka were drugs-related, inquest hears
The first hearing into the deaths of two rugby players during a tour of Sri Lanka has been told both had drugs in their system. Thomas Andrew Howard, 25, and Thomas Reed Baty, 26, who was known as Tom, were playing in the country as part of a team called Clems Pirates linked to Durham City RFC last May.
The opening inquest heard at County Durham Coroners Court in Crook has been told that on Wednesday, May 9, the team, which fundraised and encouraged others to take up the sport, had travelled to Colombo to play games and carry out some charity work.
The pair, who were part of a group of 25 men, were staying at a Hotel in the countrys capital.
On Saturday, May 12, the team took part in a match with the Ceylonese Rugby Team. After the game, the local side hosted the visitors and offered food and drink before the guests headed back to their hotel.
They got changed and at around 11pm all visited a nightclub, taking tuk tuks to the bar. They stayed for a few hours and returned to their hotel at around 2am or 3am, with some going to its Sky Bar.
Detective Constable Phil McElhone, of Durham Constabulary, said it was understood Mr Howard and Mr Baty had left the nightclub together and took a tuk tuk back to their accommodation.
Both were found the following morning in their rooms suffering from serious respiratory failure.
The coroner said the Sri Lankan investigation concluded that Mr Howards death was due to the intoxication of heroin, while Mr Batys was caused by an overdose of an opiate drug. Det Con McElhone told the court police had requested further evidence from the authorities in Sri Lanka, including witness statements, CCTV, photographs and transcripts of interviews.
He said it was uncertain when evidence would be finalised. The coroner adjourned the inquest and listed the case for mention at 12.30pm on Tuesday, December 4, at County Hall in Durham.
It is hoped that at that time progress will have been made in obtaining evidence and that it will be

Trincomalee Intl Declaration  clicks sooner than expected
The initial draft of the pioneering international declaration on Entrepreneur Education (EE) announced on October 12 in Colombo, is to be finalised sooner than previously expected.
Given the importance of SMEs in our economy we recently concluded the first UNESCO-APEID event in Sri Lanka which was also the first in South Asia. It serves the reform vision of Unity government to link our SMEs to global markets, said Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen on October 22. Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the special presentation on October 22 at BMICH on validation session of the second draft report Legal and Institutional Study for Creating Enabling Environment for SMEs, commissioned by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
The pioneering Entrepreneurship Education (EE) series by UNESCO-APEID held for the first time in South Asia successfully concluded in Colombo on October 12.
The event, seventh in the global series was launched in Trincomalee on October 9 with the participation of delegates from 21 countries, resulted in a landmark international declaration that was made by participating international delegates, has now become a key initiative in global Entrepreneur Education (EE) reforms.
The Declaration, once adopted by participants, shall introduce best practices in EE, as well as introduce EE to secondary, tertiary and TVET global curricula for the first time. NEDA has successfully concluded South Asias first UNESCO-APEID event in Sri Lanka on 12 October resulting in the Trincomalee Declaration on Entrepreneur Education which is global in scope. I am pleased to say the first draft of this Declaration is to be made available within the next three weeks time. We believe we lack in good EE and there is a need to learn from international best practices as well, said Minister Bathiudeen.
At October 12 event, NEDA Chairman-Director General, Dakshitha Bogollagma said, This Declaration is also seen as a historic first in post-war Eastern Province, elevating the Province prominence globally, and enhancing its economic profile.
The seventh UNESCO-APEID Sri Lanka series also elevated Sri Lanka as the newest Chair of UNESCO-APEID EE series-making it the first South Asian country to clinch this Chair- and as a result, Sri Lanka will lead the meeting series until Hong Kong or Brunei takes over later on. NEDA, Sri Lankas apex entrepreneur development agency under the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, aims to develop Lankan economy by encouraging, promoting, and facilitating the budding Lankan start-ups, entrepreneurs and SMEs.

TSIA laments high taxes on tile and sanitaryware imports
Tiles and Sanitaryware Importers Association (TSIA) said that a level playing field should be created between them and the local manufactures.
While 51% of the market share is owned by local manufacturers, the importers are surviving in the industry with a 49% of market share, said President, TSIA, Kamil Hussain at a Press conference in Colombo yesterday.
There are only three local manufactures that are provided with 100% plus protection and a fuel subsidy for their production. In addition most government tenders, even though they are 20% higher priced are awarded to local manufactures.
He said that with the present depreciation of the rupee they are faced with bigger issues as they buy in dollars and sell in Sri Lanka rupees. He said the local tile and sanitary industry import value is around at Rs. 12 million and they pay Rs. 6 million as taxes.
While the local manufacturers have been out there for a long time in the market, it has been detected that the sector has several weaknesses to retain competitiveness in the industry which also includes decreasing of local value addition.
The local Ceramic industry is a highly energy consuming production field and also has severe environmental issues, said Secretary, TSIA, Erwin Bulathsinghala. As an economy relying heavily on tourism, it is important to maintain environmental quality and consider about other industries to sustain and co-exist in Sri Lanka. The low population, geographical and other factors have elevated the production cost and curtailed the local production industry to be less competitive, he added.
its not correct to say that tile and sanitaryware imports to Sri Lanka are junk products that India, China, Indonesia or other markets aspire to get rid of. The tiles imported into Sri Lanka are scrutinized 100% checked for SLS standard which is equivalent to ISO standards, since at least 10 years. Tile cargos are released from the customs, only if the tested samples are approved by Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI).
These same products are equally quality assured as the products exported to other countries.
Statistic reports in Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) show that the rate of such rejections for low quality products has seen a drastic reduction over the years.
Former President TSIA D. Vigneshwaran said that there are around 200 importers and over 10, 000 employed in the sector. Since government has already provided protection to the local manufacturing industry we believe that its time for the Government to consult and encourage the manufacturers to explore avenues where they can be competitive and thriving.

UN Global Compact Sri Lanka  to Support Growth of SL Businesses
The United Nations Global Compact Network Sri Lanka is the local chapter of the worlds largest corporate sustainability initiative.
Earlier this year, it welcomed Dilhan C. Fernando CEO of Dilmah as Chairman and, Azam Bakeer-Markar, Assistant Vice President Business Development and Head of Sustainability, Aitken Spence as Representative/CEO taking over from Dr. Rohan Fernando and Sutheash Balasubramaniam respectively. Together with a renewed Board of Directors, they reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring Sri Lankas business sector develops in a sustainable manner.
The Board of Directors comprises of CEOs and other leaders from a range of industries including: Supun Weerasinghe of Dialog, Darshi Talpahewa of Hayleys, Shakthi Ranatunga of MAS, Sumeet Verma of Unilever Sri Lanka and Denver De Zylva of Virtusa. They join Ravi Fernando of INSEAD and Rathika De Silva of DNV who were part of the original Board and Jorn Sorensen, Country Director of UNDP as an ex officio member. Established in 2006 and incorporated in 2011, the local chapter includes a total of 40 Sri Lankan companies; and join over 9,500 companies in this inter sectoral and international global movement.
Members follow Ten Guiding Principles aimed at connecting business practices with labour and human rights, the environment and anti-corruption. It further resolves to engage business to support the meeting of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals agenda. Although adhering to the UN Global Compact is voluntary, the principles ensure that any organization signing up for membership operate on a fundamental understanding of sustainability and uphold its values.
The voluntary nature of the UN Global Compact raises the bar for all Companies in Sri Lanka to self monitor, although it might be perceived as a tick box exercise, it challenges companies and their leaders to subscribe to a different way of doing business, said Dilhan C. Fernando, Chairman UNGC Network Sri Lanka.
Business as a force for good that does no harm to the societal and environmental fabric of Sri Lanka has more opportunity versus a downside.The Companies within the UNGC SL Board, Steering Committee and Members already realise the value of this; we are keen on sharing this with others including small and medium enterprises so that they may gain the knowledge, tools and best practices and are able to benefit from it, he said.
Over the past few months Dilmah, MAS Holdings and Unilever have supported forums, workshops and meetings to inform, collaborate and align to the guiding principles. An additional workshop will be held for members on Communicating on Progress October 12, 2018 at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce at Navam Mawatha. Finally, a national and regional forum Making Global Goals Local is planned for the 1st quarter of 2019.

U.S, China trade dispute to  impact value chain systems
The ongoing trade dispute between the U.S and China will considerably impact the value chain systems of technological and agricultural products of Southeast and South Asian countries, a senior official representing the Indias microfinance industry said.
The trade battle between two world superpowers is expected to further affect countries, particularly engaged in manufacturing technological products such as Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore as well as countries such as Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan that mainly produce a wider variety of agricultural products.
This trade war scenario has basically created advantages as well as disadvantages, Usman Khan- Deputy CEO, Sahulat Microfinance Society in India told the Third Islamic Forum South Asia held in Colombo this week. China is a giant in marketing and it is just processing our goods and supplying end products to the U.S and other markets. And Sri Lanka and India are leading players in spice and allied products sector. We can find vast opportunities in this segment in order to face possible impact from the U.S -China trade war, he said.
He suggested that countries such as Sri Lanka and India, leading players in the spices and allied products sector and Pakistan, a well known player in dried fruit manufacturing sector should focus on processing final products in their respective countries rather than exporting spices in bulk form to various countries to be processed and exported to end consumers in the U.S and other markets.
If we do start processing some of the products especially spices in our countries and supply to the end customer, in turn it will create huge economic benefits to Sri Lanka as well as India, he said.
He said if china is going to involve in the worlds biggest war with the U.S and is not arranging its production according to the global demand, he said all the south Asian and South East Asian countries will be a dumping ground of cheaper products produced by China and it may affect domestic industries in these countries to a great extent.
Commenting on trade war and its possible impacts on apparel sector, he noted that apparel industry will take a big hit in the light of tariffs imposed by the U.S on China.

The US-China trade war worrying investors
The ongoing trade spat between the U.S. and China is the biggest threat to the market right now, not the Federal Reserves monetary policy, strategist Art Hogan said Wednesday night.
Im much more concerned about China and what that means in the long run than I am about what Fed Chairman Jay Powells doing with monetary policy, Hogan, the chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, told CNBC.
The market is trying to get their minds wrapped around what kind of guidance were going to get from companies like 3M, where they cant figure out what their input costs are going to be for 2019, he said. Does this long, drawn out, mutually destructive trade war continue through all of 2019 Or is there a way to get to the negotiating table
Hogans comments come after a steep sell-off on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 608.01 points on Wednesday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite plunged 3.1 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively.
China and the U.S. have slapped tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each others goods. These protectionist stances on trade have kept investors on edge for most of the year as they fear tighter trade conditions could slow down the global economy.
Tariffs have been a key subject discussed by companies this earnings season. More than a third of the S&P 500 companies that have reported through Tuesdays close discussed tariffs in their conference calls.
Equities are down sharply this month amid worries over corporate earnings and fears of rising rates, among other factors.
The Fed has already raised rates three times this year and is expected to hike once more before year-end, Hogan said.
The Dow and S&P 500 are down 7.1 percent and 8.9 percent in October, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has lost more than 11.5 percent this month.
But Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, thinks this move lower is driven more by technical factors than deteriorating fundamentals.www.cnbc.com

Worlds longest sea-crossing bridge
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday inaugurated apparently the worlds largest sea bridge that connects the semi-autonomous cities of Hong Kong and Macau to the expansive Peral River Delta economic zone through the Chinese mainland city of Zhuhai. Chinas mega new bridge has been hailed by many as an engineering marvel while critics have reportedly labelled it as a white elephant.
Almost 700 guests, including the leaders of Hong Kong and Macau, attended the event for the opening of the $20 billion bridge. The bridge is expected to reduce the travel time between Hong Kong and Zhuhai from three hours to 30 minutes. The bridge will also aid in boosting trade activities between mainland China and Hong Kong. China opens worlds longest sea bridge connecting Hong Kong to Macau, Zhuhai.
Times Now News
Five interesting facts aboutthe worlds largest sea bridge
The total length of the bridge is nearly 55 kilometres or 34 miles, as per news agency AFP. It is a record-breaking length for any bridge and thus the Hong Kong-Macau bridge is regarded as the longest ocean bridge and tunnel system.
Not everyone will be allowed to drive through the longest sea bridge. Only those who are wealthy or are politically connected will be permitted to drive their private vehicles through the bridge, the news agency reported. The administration will issue 10,000 licenses for Hong Kong-mainland dual-plate private cars, while the quota for licenses for Macau vehicles is just 300. People who do not have a license would have to use public transport to reach the bridge and then change to cross on private buses, AFP reported.
Drivers need to stay alert at all times when they are driving on the bridge. Special cameras installed on the bridge will keep a tab on the bus drivers and would alert authorities if they yawn too many times, AFP quoted Hong Kong media as reporting.
Blood pressure of the drivers will also be monitored. As the bridge is considered to be Chinese territory, where people drive on the right side of the road, drivers on the Hong Kong-Macau bridge would also need to switch the side of the road when they are on the bridge.
A whopping amount of 420,000 tonnes of steel was utilised in the construction of the massive bridge. According to the AFP report, the amount of steel used in the construction of the bridge was enough to build 60 Eiffel Towers.
