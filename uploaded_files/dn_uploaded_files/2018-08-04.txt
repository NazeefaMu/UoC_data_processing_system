Overcrowding impedes control of drug, mobile phone use in prisons - Galle prison suptd.
The control of drug and mobile phone use within the prisons premises is difficult owing to overcrowding. The number of prisoners have increased by six fold in comparison to that of the actual number of prisoners that can be accommodated in jails, Galle Prison Superintendent Jagath Chandana Weerasinghe disclosed.
He was speaking at the Galle District Coordinating Committee (DCC) Meeting held at the Galle District Secretariat recently.
The Galle Prisons can accommodate only 270 prisoners. However, we get an average of over 900 inmates regularly and sometimes the number exceeds 1200. As a result of the extreme congestion within the prisons, a great number of problems have cropped up, he said.
Among them the lack of sanitary facilities for the increasing numbers of prisoners is a serious impediment.
Furthermore, numerous administrative complications are posed due to the shortage of human and physical resources, he further said.
Nearly sixty five per cent of the total number of inmates have been convicted over drug related offences, he added.

After Pacquiao loss, ex-WBA champ Matthysse calls time on career
Buenos Aires, Thursday: Just two weeks after a punishing knockout loss to Filipino great Manny Pacquiao, Argentine former WBA welterweight champion Lucas Matthysse announced his retirement on Thursday.
Today I decided to hang up the gloves, another stage in my life is beginning, said the 35-year-old Matthysse, who ends his 43-fight career with a record of 38 wins, 36 inside the distance, for just five defeats and one no contest.
Matthysses last fight was a seventh round stoppage loss to Pacquiao in Kuala Lumpur, in which the previously explosive Argentine looked past his best.
Pacquiao is a great boxer, I lost to a legend, he said.
Im proud to have stayed at the top for 10 years fighting the best in the world.
He won the WBA welterweight title in January with an eighth round knockout of Thailands Tewa Kiram.
He previously held the interim WBC super-lightweight title but was narrowly beaten by American Danny Garcia in Las Vegas in 2013 when challenging for the full strap.

Bank deposit, lending rates need to come down - CB Governor
Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy said he expressed concerns at the most recent monthly meeting with Bank Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) that the bank deposit and lending rates need to come down.
The Governor made this comment at a press conference at the Central Bank auditorium yesterday.
Bank deposit and lending rates remain as rigid as they are. This is a matter of some concern for us. In fact, we told the bank CEOs that we think that the bank deposit and lending rates need to come down now. We will monitor that, he said.
Speaking on the recent government decision to write off the non-consumption loans granted up to Rs. 100,000 to women by microfinance institutions, the Governor said it was a decision based on humanitarian need and its impact at the macroeconomic level was nominal.
It is less than Rs.900 million altogether. The Government provided relief for women affected by the failure of three successive cultivation seasons due to drought. Part of the problem in the North and the East came about because there was a genuine attempt in the immediate aftermath of the end of the war to drive the rehabilitation and reconstruction programme through two pillars. One was infrastructure development and the other was to provide credit for self employment. Lots of finance institutions set up their branches in the North and the East and lent money to the people.
However, after 30 years of conflict, people in those areas did not have the wherewithal to make self employment a viable proposition. After 30 years of conflict there was a tremendous backlog of consumption. When the money was given to them a lot of it went straight into consumption. Then the problem has become more compounded by the failure of three successive crop seasons, he explained.
He said that the Finance Ministry is considering setting up a separate regulatory authority for lending only institutions that do not take deposits.
We only regulate the licensed institutions and the unregulated sector including the lending only microfinance institutions are outside our remits, he said.
He however said that the Central Bank has launched special programme to raise the awareness of the people in terms of financial literacy.
We have put out a customer charter setting out responsibilities for the financial institutions as well as for the borrowers. We have set up help desks in our regional offices in Killinochchi and Trincomalee. At the same time, we have spoken to the finance companies and the banks to make sure that they do proper evaluation, he added. Responding to a question by a journalist on the impact of duty waivers given under the Singapore-Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement, the Governor said necessary safeguards have been taken during the negotiations to avoid local manufacturers from being affected.
There will be revenue impact from tariff reductions, but during negotiations we have included a big negative list. We contain the imports of items which we have strategic interests in terms of trade. Singapore has liberalised about 97 percent of their tariff lines. We have to consider the overall benefit, the Cntral Bank Governor noted.
He pointed out the biggest advantage of the FTA with Singapore will be from investments and e-commerce.
As I understand, we will not get a considerable export advantage due to the FTA with Singapore, because those sectors are already opened through various means. The biggest advantage will be from investments and e-commerce. The Singapore investors have been provided greater comfort to come here and invest. Through E-commerce chapter included in the agreement, we can have access to ASEAN market through Singapore, he commented.

Bush fires rage over temperate lands
From the United Sates, across Greece, Portugal and Spain to distant Australia Bush fires have devastated vast regions killing hundreds of people and destroying thousands of residential and commercial buildings.
In the United States it was the district of California that was affected. Over 1,000 homes were destroyed and 37,000 rendered homeless. The total area devastated amounts to 4.25 million hectares.
Greece was the worst affected country. Over 91 persons died and another 25 have gone missing. The Government is facing a crisis situation over alleged inefficiency in managing the disaster.
France is also slightly affected. Portugal and bordering regions of Spain have also recorded bush fires with 60 killed in the former.
In Australia 40,000 hectares of land were destroyed including settlements.
Global temperature rise resulting in Earths warming and its attendant frequent fluctuations of weather causing long periods of drought as well as sudden floods, storms etc. seem to be some of the natural causes leading to the sudden vagaries of weather. Long spells of drought with no considerable rain as well as high winds and low humidity are said to be the natural factors that cause bush fires. However, there are also man-made factors. Among them the irrational clearing of beach front forests, unregulated construction of residential quarters in close proximity to each other lack of town planning predominate. Lack of disaster preparedness as well as poor disaster management has also contributed to aggravate the situation.
Another fire phenomenon that was witnessed simultaneously in the last few weeks was the eruption of a series of volcanoes in Guatemala, Hawaii, Indonesia and Jamaica. It has been observed that there is an increase of volcanic activity during recent times. Changes in the rotational speed of the Earth due to the attraction of the Sun and the Moon, and movement of tectonic plates are said to be partly responsible for this phenomenon. Whatever it is bush fires are being complemented by a natural fire festival too.
Pope Francis opposes death penalty
His Holiness Pope Francis has once again come out openly against the imposition of capital punishment. According to the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the death penalty now is no longer admissible under any circumstances.
The Vatican announced on Thursday Pope Francis approved changes to the compendium of Catholic teaching published under Pope John Paul II.
The death penalty is inadmissible because it is an attack on the inviolability and dignity of the person, reads the Catechism of the Catholic Church now on the death penalty, with the addition that the Church works with determination for its abolition worldwide.
The statement released by the Vaticans press office on Thursday says that Francis approved the new changes to point number 2267 of the Catechism on May 11, 2018, during a meeting with the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Spanish Cardinal Luis Ladabaria.
As its been re-written, the Catechism now also says that Recourse to the death penalty on the part of legitimate authority, following a fair trial, was long considered an appropriate response to the gravity of certain crimes and an acceptable, albeit extreme, means of safeguarding the common good.
Yet today, there is an increasing awareness that the dignity of the person is not lost even after the commission of very serious crimes. In addition, a new understanding has emerged of the significance of penal sanctions imposed by the state.
Lastly, more effective systems of detention have been developed, which ensure the due protection of citizens but, at the same time, do not definitively deprive the guilty of the possibility of redemption, reads the Catechism now.
Capital punishment is still implemented in 53 countries including the United States, China, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Japan among others.
Tough days ahead for Imran Khan
Tough days are ahead for Prime Minister Imran Khan. He will face a hostile Parliament, weakened economy with an increased debt burden, sour relations with the United States and India, a considerable youth population demanding employment and challenges from diverse insurgent and religious groups.
The United States as already warned Pakistans new government that IMF dollars should not be used to bail out Pakistans debt to China under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). It is an undue interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan for with whom it deals in its economic relations cannot be a concern for third parties.
So far the tidings are good. Imran Khan has promised United States and the telephone conversation between Modi and Khan seems to have a beneficial effect that could yield a thaw in Indo-Pakistan relations. Some analysts also predict that Imran Khans mediation would become useful in Afghanistan as the US has decided in pursue its plan B- negotiations to contain the Taliban insurgency. On the domestic front the PTI of Imran Khan has been able to work out a strategy for a coalition government that has strengthened its parliamentary strength. The BNP has joined it. The latter has been also offered the Chief Minister post in Balochistan. Four independent MPS have already joined the PTI.
In any case Imran Khan has also to tread carefully and slowly to re-balance relations between the civilian administration and the powerful military whose signature is evident in the political development of the country.

China, S.E. Asian states hold simulated naval drill
SINGAPORE: China and Southeast Asian states held simulated naval exercises this week for the first time, Singapore said Friday, as they seek to lower long-running tensions in disputed waters.
The table-top exercises at a Singapore naval base came ahead of the first naval drills between the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Beijing, scheduled for October.
Four ASEAN states -- Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam -- have rival claims with Beijing over territory in the flashpoint South China Sea.
China claims almost the entire sea and has been constructing artificial islands capable of hosting military bases in the waters, ratcheting up tensions with rival claimants and the US, the traditionally dominant naval power in the area.
The simulated drill was held Thursday and Friday, Singapores defence ministry said in a statement.
It was timed to coincide with a series of ASEAN-led meetings in the city-state this week, including a security forum on Saturday at which US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be seeking to reassure Asian allies of continued American commitment to the region. Washington has traditionally backed Beijings rival claimants in South China Sea disputes and has stepped up naval patrols in the waters, angering China.
Chinese and ASEAN navies developed plans for the October field drills, including how to deal with maritime incidents like search and rescue and medical evacuation, Singapores defence ministry said in a statement.
It also involved plans on approaching a distressed vessel, the statement said.
This table-top exercise has been a good first step for navies from ASEAN countries and China to work together to deal with maritime incidents at sea, said Colonel Lim Yu Chuan, a senior Singapore naval officer and exercise co-director.
Captain Liang Zhijia of the Chinese navy said the simulated and field drills are good platforms to build trust and confidence.
China and ASEAN this week announced they had agreed on a draft negotiating text as part of efforts to forge a code of conduct to govern behaviour in the South China Sea. The draft however showed that Beijing wanted to stage military drills with ASEAN in the seas that excluded outside countries, a move analysts said was aimed at diminishing US influence.

## Title: Core points of coalition

Core points of coalition
After the presidential elections and the general elections in 2015, the national unity government was formed by the two main political parties of the country  the SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena and the UNP led by Ranil Wickremesinghe. The regime change brought about by the defeat of the Rajapaksa government gave much hope to the people of this country who wanted a new administration guided by the democratic principles of justice, equality and good governance. There was a serious erosion of the democratic rights of the people during the Rajapaksa administration which was authoritarian. The formation of the coalition government signified a deviation from the political culture of eternal confrontation between the two main political parties, the UNP and the SLFP.
The National Unity Government was able to take some constructive steps for bringing about national reconciliation. It should be appreciated that the former government under President Mahinda Rajapaksa gave attention to some urgent existential needs such as the reconstruction of school and hospital buildings, reconstruction of roads and railways and making facilities available for people to engage in their economic activities such as farming and fishing. But, there was a very significant deficit in the post-war reconciliation process. It was the failure on the part of the government to understand the need for healing the wounds in the hearts and minds of the people of both sides.
Reconciliation means uniting the hearts and minds of the people who were already separated. It can be stated that certain activities of the government and the armed forces have played a negative role in the reconciliation process. For example, the celebration of victory by the government after defeating the LTTE at the final stage of the war in 2009, symbolizes according to the mindset of the Tamil people, the victory of the Sinhalese fighters (the armed forces of the Sri Lankan government) by defeating the Tamil fighters (LTTE). They consider the Sri Lankan armed forces consisting predominantly of Sinhalese soldiers as an army of the Sinhalese people who were fighting for the Sinhalese. As such, the decision of the present government to discontinue the holding of victory parades and to have events only for the commemoration of the death of the members of the armed forces and civilians in all parts of the country including the North and East, is highly commendable. As a result of the war, not only the combatants, several thousands of civilians also died in the North and East. The nature of the phenomenon of war is such that civilian deaths cannot be totally avoided.
Enactment of progressive legislation
The National Unity Government was able to get some progressive legislation passed in Parliament. For example, The 19th Amendment to the Constitution reduced the powers of the President substantially, by creating the Constitutional Council and other independent commissions such as the Public Service Commission, the National Police Commission, the Human Rights Commission and the Commission to investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption.
The establishment of these independent commissions contributed substantially to the restoration of the independence of the judiciary and good governance in the country. Acts of Parliament for the establishment of the Office of Missing Persons, the Judicature (amendment) Act aimed at expediting the cases involving economic and financial crimes of very serious nature, the Enforced Disappearances Act, the Right to Information Act are several other legislative enactments that can contribute to national reconciliation and good governance. For getting this legislation passed by a majority, extension of cooperation by some opposition parties in Parliament, specially the TNA and the JVP, to the ruling coalition was another positive tendency in Sri Lankan politics. The contribution made by the TNA and its leader R. Sampandan, as the leader of the Opposition, is commendable.
The TNA represented the vast majority of Tamil voters in the North and East. The other political parties representing Tamils in the North and East did not have substantial public support.
Formation of the National Unity Government
The split that occurred in the SLFP before the presidential elections of 2015 resulted in one faction led by Maithripala Sirisena cooperating with the UNP for nominating a common presidential candidate and after the presidential elections and the general elections, forming the National Unity Government which is a coalition of the two main political parties in the country.
The other faction of the SLFP led by the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, remained in the opposition and adopted a confrontationist approach to the unity government. It formed a separate political party  the SLPP (Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna). The objective of the SLPP was from the very beginning the obstruction of whatever initiatives and steps taken by the unity government for implementing the measures undertaken by the government, after the war, to usher in the state of durable peace and reconciliation between the two main ethnic communities, the Sinhalese and the Tamils.
The Joint Opposition, the SLPP has engaged in a propaganda campaign portraying the reconciliation process as an anti-Sinhala campaign supported by some western countries for reviving the LTTE and establishing the Tamil Eelam. The constitutional amendment procedure adopted by the parliament is projected as an attempt to establish a federal government which means, according to them, a separate state for the North and East. They criticize the government for some steps taken for addressing the grievances of the Tamil community. For example, withdrawal of the armed units from some areas to enable the owners of the lands to reoccupy them is portrayed as a threat to the national security. Even steps taken by the law enforcement authorities to take into custody and prosecute some members of the armed forces for some criminal acts committed while they were in the military service, are portrayed as anti-national acts aimed at harassing war heroes. It appears that this propaganda campaign has been successful in generating a feeling among the Sinhalese that the reconciliation process of the incumbent government is a serious threat to the security of the country.
The traditional tendency for the opposition in Sri-Lankan politics has been to use ethnic nationalism as an instrument for mobilizing the people against the party or parties in power, whenever an attempt is made for resolving the conflict.
Erosion of political support base of coalition partners
The anti-government propaganda campaign of the SLPP led by the former President resulted in a serious erosion of the political support base of both the UNP and the SLFP as indicated by the results of the recently held local government elections. To make matters worse, investigations in to the Treasury bond scams have exposed the involvement of many politicians. The politicians involved in the bond scams appear to be members of the UNP. It is the responsibility of the UNP to reorganise and democratize the party machinery by removing all those who are involved in the Treasury bond scams and other corrupt dealings from responsible posts in the administration and responsibilities within the party.
Split in the SLFP
Another serious threat to the effective functioning of the government is the split that occurred in the SLFP after some MPs voted in support of the no-confidence motion against the Prime Minister. The sixteen MPs are now acting in Parliament as another opposition group. It is unfortunate that this defection of sixteen MPs has posed a serious challenge to the stability of the government and its capability to deliver. Therefore, the need of the hour, is to reorganise and revitalize the SLFP under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena aimed at accelerating the speed with which the administration moves ahead for realizing the goals of reconciliation and good governance, which were clearly laid down in the policy statements issued for the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2015.
Dwindling of public support for the TNA
Another concurrent development taking place in the North is the dwindling of public support to the TNA, the main political party of the Tamil people, as indicated by the results of the local government elections. Perhaps, this may be the result of the effective propaganda campaign of the other small political parties which were extremist ethnic nationalist groups who opposed the approach adopted by the TNA in accordance with the moderate policy of supporting the post-war reconciliation process of the government under the leadership of the Prime Minister and the President.
There are even some voices emanating from some extremist sections of the Tamil community expressing the wish for the revival of the LTTE. It is very unfortunate that there are some sections of the Tamil community who are not aware of the fact that the LTTE was a terrorist movement with an extremist political ideology which was the reason for the failure of all attempts made for a political settlement through discussions even with the involvement of the international community. However, the peace-loving people in the North and East will not encourage or support any terrorist movement aiming at establishing a despotic government led by a dictator. They do not wish to be slaves under a dictator. They want to live with dignity and self-respect in a democratic system of governance.

Countrys foreign reserves to increase to usd 9bn
The countrys foreign reserves will rise to about USD 9 billion by the end of this year, an amount that could comfortably cover the countys import bill for five months, Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajith Coomaraswamy said.
Speaking to the media at the Central Bank auditorium yesterday, the Governor said the countrys foreign reserves stood at USD 8.4 billion by the end of July.
He said another USD 1.5 billion will come in the remaining months of this year from a syndicated loan from the China Development Bank, IMF next tranche and panda bonds issuance.
USD 1 billion will come this year from a syndicated loan from China Development Bank (at 5.35percent interest rate). Its first tranche of USD 500 million will be in the middle of August and the other tranche of USD 500 million will be in October. If everything goes well, there should be one more IMF tranche of USD 250 million within this year, he said.
The Governor said the Central Bank has also decided to explore panda bonds market to improve its foreign reserves.
We are working towards panda bonds issuance before the end of the year.
We went on a non-deal road show to China and met representatives of some banks, insurance companies, other institutional investors and most importantly the Peoples Bank of China.
The Deputy Governor of Peoples Bank of China came up with a totally unsolicited suggestion that we set up a joint task force to examine how Sri Lanka could explore panda bonds market. We target about USD 250 million from panda bonds issuance, he commented. Responding to journalists questions as to why China is turning up to be so benevolent towards Sri Lanka, Dr. Coomaraswamy said, During the consultations, it was clear that they see us as a key strategic partner given our location.
In addition, Sino-Sri Lanka relations have been excellent right through from the Rubber-Rice Pact in 1952. China has always been supportive of Sri Lanka.
The Central Bank Governor at the outset of the press conference made it clear that it was unlikely that the economic growth will exceed 4 percent this year, well below the potential rate of growth initially set as 5.7 percent.
If one is realistic it is unlikely that economic growth is going to be more than 4 percent this year. The first half is likely to grow at about 3.4 percent and to achieve a 4 percent growth, you will have to have an average 4.6 percent growth in the second half. I do not predict anything beyond that. Last year, we were surprised with the downside of growth and hopefully this time we will be surprised with upside, he told the media.
The Governor with his higher ranking Central Bank officials called the press conference to announce the Monetary Board decision made on Thursday to maintain policy interest rates at their current levels.
Accordingly, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank will remain at 7.25 per cent and 8.50 per cent, respectively.

Farmers using organic fertiliser to receive Rs. 18,000 subsidy
The Agriculture Ministry has decided to provide a fertiliser subsidy of Rs.18,000 per hectare for the farmers using organic fertiliser for their cultivations.
During a discussion held recently at the Ministry, Minister Amaraweera directed the relevant authorities to take necessary measures to implement this procedure.
According to the Minister, this decision has been taken to encourage local farmers who engage in organic farming.
Instead of the fertiliser subsidy offered to farmers using chemical fertilisers,organic farmers will receive the money. According to Ministry statistics, about 5,000 farmers are engaged in organic farming and Cabinet approval has also been received to provide the necessary funds for the purchase of organic fertiliser from the Maha Season in 2018.
The Minister plans to hold discussions with organic fertiliser producers to implement an organic fertiliser production programme.
The government has already allocated Rs.33 billion for the fertiliser subsidy programme this year.

Five-star Sharma leaves India eyeing victory in England series opener
BIRMINGHAM Aug 3: Ishant Sharma took five wickets, including three in an over, to leave India with a target of just 194 to win the first Test against England -- and more than two days' play to get them.
England were dismissed for 180 in a second innings that lasted a mere 53 overs on the third day at Edgbaston on Friday.
Their 1,000th Test match had threatened to end in a humiliating defeat as they slumped to 87 for seven shortly after lunch.
But Sam Curran, in just his second match at this level, struck a dashing 63, his maiden Test fifty, to leave England with a glimmer of hope in the first of this five-match series.
It was an impressive effort by the 20-year-old Curran, batting at No 8 and came just a day after the Surrey left-arm swing bowler had taken Test-best figures of four for 74.
But it also showed up the poor display by England's top order, with the next best score in the innings Jonny Bairstow's 28.
England had been on course to build a first-innings lead of more than a hundred runs.
But a masterful 149 by India captain Virat Kohli, the star batsman's first Test century in England, took India to 274 all out, a deficit of just 13 runs.
And before Thursday's close, India captured the prize wicket of Alastair Cook, England's all-time leading Test run-scorer, for a duck when, for the second time this match, off-spinner RavichandranAshwin bowled him with a superb delivery that pitched on middle and hit the off-stump.
It was not long on Friday before were England were 18 for two when Keaton Jennings nicked Ashwin to KL Rahul at second slip.
Ashwin struck again when England captain Joe Root, his team's best batsman, saw a genuine clip off pads lead to an excellent low catch at leg-slip by Rahul.
Root, who top-scored with 80 in England's first innings, put his hand on his head in despair at what he'd done in falling for 14.
Ashwin took three for 59 to follow his first-innings return of four for 62.
Middlesex left-hander Dawid Malan arguably 'owed' England a big score after dropping Kohli in the slips on 21 and 51 on Thursday.
But he fell for 20 when, squared up by Sharma's superb outswinger from around the wicket, he edged to Ajinkya Rahane in the gully.
Sharma then had Bairstow taken by Shikhar Dhawan at first slip and two balls later he dismissed Ben Stokes (six) via a fine low catch by Kohli at third slip off what became the last ball before lunch, with England 86 for six off 30.4 overs at the interval.
Two balls after play resumed, Sharma had dangerman Jos Buttler caught behind and England were 87 for seven. But Curran, after a couple of fortunate edges and being dropped on 13 by Dhawan in the slips -- a tough chance -- found his form.
He struck Ashwin for a magnificent straight six and next ball drove him down to long-on for four.
Curran then brought up his maiden Test fifty in style when he lofted Sharma over extra-cover for a second six to reach the landmark in just 54 balls, including eight fours. He was eventually last man out on the stroke of tea, caught behind off Umesh Yadav. AFP

GMOA launching TU action at expense of patients - Rajitha
Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said that the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA)launched the Trade Union action at the expense of lives of innocent patients.
He said that the association launched the Trade Union action by misleading the public citing various minor issues through the media. The GMOA had cited that the Inland Revenue Tax on doctors has been increased from 12 per cent to 24 percent and this was one of the main reasons that led them to go for a strike action yesterday.
The Ministry insisted that this tax increase is applicable to the doctors whose income exceeds Rs.350,000 a month.
The 12 per cent tax on doctors whose monthly income does not exceed Rs.350,000 remains unchanged, the Minister said yesterday. Minister Senaratne added that the GMOAs claim that a tax of 24% has been imposed on all Government Medical Officers is wrong. The GMOA has also said that the public has to bear the burden due to the 15 per cent VAT on private hospitals.
Minister Senaratne added that the 15 per cent VAT on private hospitals has been removed completetly. He added that patients seeking medical treatments at private hospitals are not taxed and the GMOA has launched a Trade Union action without any consideration to the innocent patients seeking treatment at government hospitals. Meanwhile, Government Medical Officers association (GMOA) said that their TU action will end at 8.00 am this morning (August 4). But the Executive Committee of the GMOA wil meet next week in order to take a decision on further trade union actions, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that the sole responsibility for the difficulties faced by the patients during the strike should be held by the Government. The strike did not impede the operation all emergency treatment units, childrens, maternity, cancer, kidney and army hospitals in the country including Kidney Treatment Units.
Thousands of patients seeking treatments at government hospitals were stranded yesterday due to this strike.

A greener future
For the people in Sri Lanka, forests have always played an important role. They have shaped our culture, our history, our sagas and our traditional songs. Their diversity has provided vital products and amenities to our society including quality habitat for wildlife, biodiversity of plant and animal communities, clean water and aesthetic benefits.
It is in this background we need to take a look at the latest report on our forest cover. Statistics reveal that our closed canopy natural forest cover in the country, which stood at 80.0% of land area until the turn of the century had dwindled to less than 29% by 2016.
President Maithripala Sirisena is quite concerned about the situation. Addressing the FAO parley in Rome recently, he said that the government is committed to plant five million trees by 2020 and increase the forest cover to 32 per cent.
If the Presidents bold challenge is to be fulfilled, the writer believes, four initial requirements must be met before the campaign starts: First, identify the land to be reforested; second, arrange for the required budget and third, seek suitable technology needed and fourth, canvass people's maximum support.
Land
Areas that need to be brought under tree cover will necessarily be mainly government land. This would include degraded and scrub forest lands, waste and unused lands, grazing lands and pasture, river canal and tank banks, along national and state highways, village roads, etc.
Technology
Planting five million trees with two years needs high technology.
Today, there are many advanced systems used in replanting. One is the usage of drones. A drone, mounted with an air gun, will be able to seed a hectare of deforested land in less than half an hour  a job that would take four people using conventional tree-planting methods more than six days.
Thailand and Japan are utilising this system. The scientists are now improving the structure of the delivery vehicle  how to drop seeds into the ground so that they have the best chance of germinating.
Miyawaki method
Another system widely used elsewhere is known as Miyawaki system. It was designed by Akira Miyawaki, a Japanese scientist. He has planted around 40 million trees all over the world, and in 2006, won the Blue Planet Prize, the equivalent to the Nobel Prize in the environmental field.
His method is based on whats called potential natural vegetation- a theory that if a piece of land is free from human intervention, a forest will naturally self-seed and take over that land within a period of around 600 to 1,000 years. It will develop species that would be native and robust requiring no maintenance.
Miyawakis methodology cuts it down to 10 years. His system is simple. Firstly, you identify what nutrition the soil lacks, what species are most suitable to be grown in this soil and what biomass is abundantly available in that region to give the soil whatever nourishment it needs, (e.g. animal manure or press mud). Secondly, you amend the soil to a depth of one metre and plant saplings that are up to 80 centimetres high, packing them in very densely- three to five per square metre. The forest itself must cover a 100-square-metre minimum area.
This grows into a forest so dense that after eight months, sunlight cannot reach the ground. At this point, every drop of rain that falls is conserved, and every leaf that falls is converted into humus. The forest needs to be watered and weeded for the first two or three years, at which point it becomes self-sustaining.
Miyawakis methodology is a natural process and this had been successfully adapted by many countries successfully.
Public participation
Public participation in forestry has become an issue of growing importance in world-wide forest policy discussions over the past few decades. However, in Sri Lanka, various forms of participatory forest management have been successfully practised for centuries. Since the UN Rio Conference on Environment and Development in 1992, the need for interaction between forestry and society and the concept of public participation have been recognized as integral to sustainable forest management.
There are a number of reasons for encouraging public participation process in forestry. Most importantly, it will improve public understanding of forestry issues and mutual recognition of interests. It can also stimulate involvement in decision making and, in the process, identify and manage conflicts in a fair way agreeable to all parties.
It may be true and a globally accepted fact that active participation of public and other non-governmental parties will be beneficial for all parties concerned. But caution needs to be taken that all parties involved should have an equal opportunity to express their opinions and an equitable chance to assert their interests and rights. Because of the voluntary nature of the process, no decision can be imposed on anybody.
Finally, public participation in forestry should be a means to develop better-informed and more widely accepted forest management outcomes. In this sense, public participation represents a tool to enhance the social sustainability of forest management.
Types
When we study other countries experiences, we come across three types of public participation process in forestry. (1) Forest policies, programmes and plans: This participatory process takes place at an early stage of decision-making in order to anticipate conflicts and to enhance transparency and social acceptance of policies or plans. (2) Special forest projects: In these cases, public participation aims at promoting direct public involvement in the implementation of special forest project. (3) Advisory boards: Generally, these are permanent types of forum that help the public to be better informed and to have a more direct influence in forestry-related matters.
Participatory management is much more than a technique, it is a way of thinking and acting for both decision makers and participants. All problems or conflicts may however not be solved within the participatory process. Creating a climate of good faith and involving all stakeholders in cooperative problem solving is a true challenge for public participation.
The successful countries experiences also reveal that natural and local tree varieties, including non-timber forest plantings, will have to be the cornerstone of the replanting strategy. The main objective should be to ensure environmental stability, ecological balance and preservation of biodiversity. However, the strategy should also consider, as a secondary matter, to meet the needs, protection and privileges of villagers living close-by.
Funding
It is obvious that to become successful in this strategy, the government will have to be the largest fund provider. It is doubtful whether private sector will have the same commitment and perseverance to carry on with this type of a project, unless attractive benefits are offered.
A reasonable allocation from the budget will be necessary to match the estimated contribution of forests to the GDP. It is a worthwhile investment because we are not even taking into account the ecosystem benefits contributed by them. Forest development is every citizens responsibility and, therefore, must become an integrated activity. That is why public participation is a must to maximise the effectiveness in caring for the forests and to move towards achieving excellence.
Our neighbour, India has recently formulated policy plan for participation of public sector in a forestation. It may be a good idea, if Sri Lanka takes a cue from them and introduce policy guidelines for public participation to our forestry programme.

IMRAN KHAN - Yes he Khan be the Premier!
Memories of IMRAN KHAN that excellent all round cricketer who will be Pakistan's next Prime Minister remain vivid. When Sri Lanka made its first Test tour to Pakistan in 1982, I was the first journalist to accompany the Sri Lanka team and describe the Three Test series as Sports Editor of the Times Group. And what a delight it was to meet the handsome IMRAN KHAN! who is our SPORTS LEGEND today.
During that series, I first met the dashing, debonaire and handsome KHAN when he played in the Second Test in Lahore. I was introduced to the likeable IMRAN by Pakistani journalists Qamar Ahmed, Chisty Mujahid, Salahuddin and Ali Baig. And while waiting for a taxi at the Hilton Hotel, KHAN gave us a lift to the Lahore Cricket Ground in his vehicle where the Second Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan was to begin.
KHAN came into this Test after refusing to play in the First owing to some controversy. Pakistan won the First Test in Karachi. In the Second Test the Sri Lankan batsmen were given a baptism of fire by KHAN who bowled beautifully with speed, late both way swing and accuracy to instill fear and bundle out the Lankans to easily win that Test.
Vicious inswinger
One incident that is vivid in my mind was the vicious inswinger he delivered to send batsman Rohan Jayasekeras middle stump cart wheeling to wicket keeper Wasim Bari. That delivery cut in like a vicious off spinner bowled by former England great Jim Laker.
KHAN from the time he took to the game as a little kid, showed great promise of becoming one, if not the greatest cricketers the game and the world was going to see as in later years his career began to zoom.
Growing up and sporting film star looks, the tall and handsome IMRAN KHAN not only began to take by storm the cricket scenes he played in, not only in Pakistan but in all international venues .
Expert comments
Incidentally on that tour and in that particular Test I was asked to give expert comments on Pakistan Radio which was broadcasting the Test, by Wasim Tariq one of the top cricket commentators of that era. And of course my comments were all about KHAN!
With the home grown umpires tending to be unreliable and questionable with their controversial umpiring, it was KHAN who first mentioned the concept of neutral umpires that later came into vogue and still persists thanks to the sponsorship of EMIRATES AIRLINES who sponsored this concept and still do.
Ball tampering
With ball tampering now rampant in the international cricket scene, the latest offender to be found guilty being captain Dinesh Chandimal of Sri Lanka, KHAN once admitted that he used to scratch the ball with a bottle top to gain unfair advantage and swing the ball that batsmen found unplayable and being dismissed inexplicably.
KHAN attraction was not only his cricketing prowess but being handsome to a fault he got the glad eye from the beauties!
The Oxford educated Pathan was bracketed with Sir Garfield Sobers of the West Indies as the greatest all rounders that the game of cricket has seen.
That was because as a new ball bowler, he bowled every conceivable swing and vicious bouncers, could take apart any penetrative and damage causing bowling attack with his bat that he used like a rapier and could field equally well.. As captain he was a marvel
As captain he was a marvel. With an extraordinary cricket brain, he would quickly spot the weakness of a batsman and instruct his bowler showing him how to knock a batsman out.
Cricketers of the brand of KHAN are not on the scene now and not likely to be born. His crowning moment in the game that he adorned with aplomb and great respect was leading Pakistan to victory against England in the World Cup in Australia in the 1992 final beating the country that gave the game to the world.
No Pakistan team has since laid its hand on the World Cup. It was not a great team that KHAN led, but with clever captaincy he turned them into world beaters. KHAN suffered a terrible blow in his career that was heart rending when he lost his beloved mother to the terminal illness.
Having watched his mother suffer, he realized the suffering others suffer with this dreaded illness and set about building a Cancer Hospital which is a reality now.
Biggest heartthrob
KHAN the charismatic aristocrat has been described has being one of the biggest heartthrobs. Suave, erudite and monstrously talented living cricketer in the subcontinent, real sex appeal in the 1970s and 1980s.
KHAN who played most of his cricket in England, first at Oxford University rarely showcased his talents in Pakistan, was a regular for English counties Worcestershire, known as the sauce county and Sussex for which country former South African and England captain Tony Greig and Sri Lankas Gehan Mendis played.
You must go when everyone is asking why and why not, was KHAN'S reply when questioned on retirement. KHAN also created a sensation when after three drawn series against England he led the team to a series victory against the opponents in 1987 when with explosive spell of fast bowling he took a match bag of 10 for 77 at Headingly on which venue Sri Lanka scored its first historic Test series win against England.
Test cricket in Pakistan again
It would be interesting to wait and watch with keen interest whether KHAN can use his influence to bring back international cricket to the cricket starved fireball that is Pakistan. International cricket was called full stop after the attempted bombing of the Sri Lanka cricket team and its miraculous escape.
KHAN was born on October 5, 1952 in Lahore, Punjab and the teams he played for were Pakistan, Dawood Club, Lahore, New South Wales, Oxford University, Pakistan International Airways, Sussex and Worcestershire.
KHANS cousins were former Pakistan captains Javed Burki and Majid Khan. KHAN made his Test debut against England at Birmingham on June 3, 1971 and figured in his final Test vs Sri Lanka in Faisalabad on January 2,1992. His ODI debut was when he fronted up to England at Nottingham on August 3, 1974 and quit against England at Melbourne on March 25, 1992.
Played in 88 Test matches
KHAN played in 88 Tests, playing 126 innings with 25 not outs scoring 3807 runs with a highest score of 136. He made six three figure scores, 18 half tons. In ODI cricket he played 175 games batting 151 times with 40 not outs making 3709 runs with a highest score of an unbeaten 102 with one century and 18 fifties.
His Test bowling figures were  362 wickets and best match bag of 14 scalps. Best figures in ODIS 182 wickets and best figures in a match 6 for 14. After quitting the game, he plunged into the highly volatile political scene in Pakistan and all countries will be watching whether he has the political acumen to lead Pakistan to use a biblical term into the promised land.
We here at TNC of the leading morning daily the DAILY NEWS wish IMRAN KHAN well in his new game POLITICS.

India boost for lankan womens kabaddi team at asian games
When Madushani Chaturika was 13, back in 2005, she decided to take the advice of her netball teacher at Henegama Central College in the Gampaha District and take up a sport called kabaddi.
It was a momentous move for today Chaturika is the captain of the Sri Lanka womens kabaddi squad to the Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang this month  a gang of girls tipped to win a medal by none other than their expert Indian coach who has been impressed with the team since joining them a month ago.
Im very confident that this team can win a medal for Sri Lanka at the Asian Games, says J. Udayakumar, a gold-medal winning coach with the Indian mens national team at the 2002, 2006 and 2014 Asian Games. If such a proficient person believes in Chaturika and her teammates, Sri Lanka seem to have an Asian Games medal in kabaddi in the bag this month.
These girls are rough and tough and expect them to win a bronze medal at least. I have been very impressed with what I have seen. They have agility, strength and power, all necessary attributes to play kabaddi, Udayakumar points out.
We watch raiders Sajini Jayasinghe and Manojini Sithumini try and tag defenders. The Sri Lankan womens team are hard at practice under the close scrutiny of Udayakumar who has been deputised by the Indian Kabaddi Federation to help the local counterparts.
I have been here for a short time and in this period, I have seen plenty of commitment from the Sri Lanka womens team. They might have to improve a little bit on their fitness though for it is a key aspect. But I will leave that up to them for my role is to work on team strategy and have a game plan, Udayakumar reveals.
Coming from a man who has coached India in more than 100 internationals, including two World Cups, it will give much hope to local kabaddi officials who have pinned their hope of this sport winning a team medal at the August 18-September 2 Asian Games.
We are all hopeful of winning a medal. At present our ranking in Asia is fourth. At last years Asian Championships, we finished third behind India and South Korea and we are aiming to do better with the technical help we are getting from the Indian coach, says a confident Chaturika.
When she had just turned teenager, her netball teacher told her to change sports because her husband was involved in kabaddi and was looking to set up a team at Henegama Central College.
It was a big difference but I liked the sport. The speed and running I needed for netball helped me make the transition smoothly to kabaddi, Chaturika added.
Two years after taking up kabaddi, Chaturika found herself in the Sri Lanka national pool. In 2010, she was part of the national team which won a bronze medal at the South Asian Games in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This is the first time a womens team will represent Sri Lanka at the Asian Games.
The entire 18-strong squad in the national pool training for the Asian Games is drawn from the Armed Forces. Nine are from the Air Force, six from the Navy and three from the Army.
Chaturika, who is an Able Rating and has been in the Navy for nine years added: Kabaddi is not a popular sport in Sri Lanka but I hope if we can win a medal, it will help boost the profile of the sport. But whatever happens I have to be thankful for kabaddi which has given me the opportunity to represent my country.

For playing in unsanctioned league in Mauritius
India U19 captain Rawat under scanner
Delhis wicketkeeper-batsman Anuj Rawat, who recently captained India U-19 in four-day matches in Sri Lanka, is under the scanner for playing an unsanctioned T20 league in Mauritius last year along with a host of Pakistani cricketers.
The tournament was held in June last year and Anuj played in it alongside some lesser-known first-class players like Asad Pathan.
Normally for playing in leagues in UK or Bangladesh, a cricketer needs (No Objection Certificate) NOC from BCCI to apply for visa.
However, for travelling to Mauritius, Indian nationals dont need a visa if the intended stay is for not more than 60 days.
Anuj, who is currently playing a one day series against Sri Lanka colts, appeared to have not procured any NOC from the BCCI to play in the unsanctioned tournament.
Former England international Owais Shah also played the tournament.
Acting BCCI secretary Amitabh Chaudhary was shocked to know that some players have played in the unsanctioned tournament.
The age group players are educated by BCCI at the national level. This is very unfortunate if junior players have gone ahead and played unsanctioned tournament. This needs to be looked into seriously, Choudhary said.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP
Mahesh , Lasantha and Sujeewa to give their best
The Kandy Sports Clubs newly elected president Mahesh Weerasinghe, senior vice president Lasanatha Wijesuriya and secretary Sujeewa Liyanage are all-out to give rugby a big facelift. The objectives of these three with the backing of Malik Samarawickrema is to provide facilities for the game and to encourage interest at all levels and on an equal gender basis. The club will also encourage the use of its facilities by other local community groups and schools. The club is a non- profit making organization. Full membership is open to all including any playing member who has reached his eighteenth birthday. Most of the Kandy town supporters are proud of the new committee and they should repose the confidence placed in them and should continue the good work done in the last two and half decades. These above named should continue the good work. This time the 2018/19 league season is expected to kick off in November.
OTSC tag rugby  well played and organized
Some top players were in action last Saturday at the first ever Old Trinitians Sports Club tag rugby tournament. Old Trinitians gathered in numbers to soak in the action. In total 18 teams took part, players selected from Nuwara Eliya, Colombo, Kegalle, Kurunegala and Kandy OBA branches participated and one had to be below 40 years and the other was over 40. In the below 40 tournament Wolf Pack were the winners and in the over 40 Mighty 40 emerged champs. All the players were keen and showed off their skills and did not disappoint with structured team defences, strong attacking play and good running onto the ball and support play which was a work-on area within its curriculum. Throughout the whole day the players worked very well together with a clear understanding of the laws and respect for the opposition and referee.
Netball in the hills
Today is the last day of the three day Sri Lanka Schools 27th Netball Championship 2018, which is being held at the Bogambara Stadium, where there were more than 5,500 school children in action. The event is organised by the Sri Lanka Schools Netball Association with Milo serving as the main sponsor. Group A participants were - Under-13, Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 age groups while teams in Group B were Under-15, Under-17 and Under-19 categories. Students from 370 schools in Group A, and 90 schools in Group B participated making it total of 5,500 netball players in action.

U16 All-Island rugby tens
The much awaited inter school under 16 ten a side rugby will take place today and tomorrow. On Saturday the first round matches will be played at Trinity College grounds Pallekelle, and on Sunday the second round matches will be at the Provincial Council grounds Digana. Every rugby lover expected the matches to be played in Kandy, but due to high ground charges they have shifted the venue. Last year too, the tournament was played in Kandy and Trinity College coached by Thusitha de Silva emerged champions beating Kingswood College in extra time. This time too the same coach is all out to guide them in the right way. St. Sylvesters College, St. Josephs College and Dharmaraja College were the winners in the other categories, claiming the Shield, Bowl and Plate. This time Trinity, St. Anthonys, Dharmaraja, Vidyartha, Kingswood, Sri Sumangala and Sylvesters are the teams from Kandy who will be in acion.
Vidyartha Cup runner-up in Schools U18 sevens rugby
Last Sunday Vidyartha College made Kandy proud by taking the second spot in the schools under 18 Sevens Cup competition. They went down to St .Peters College 21-26. Everyone thought it was going to be a Vidyartha win as they led 14-7 at half time. It was sheer bad luck and a bad decision to continue playing an injured player in the last stages of the game without replacing him. This is where they failed. Vidyartha beat Trinity in the semi-final 19-14. The Bowl championship was won by Kingswood College they beat D.S.Senanayake College 22-4 in the final. They gave a good display of rugby. Sri Sumangala (St. Pauls) College with their good quality of play won the Shield.
Isuru captain, Champika coach
Vidyartha College despite having limited facilities has emerged as one of the leading cricket playing schools, they have been playing cricket since 1952 and has reached great heights without a proper playing field, they have a pint sized ground at Nittawela where they do their practices. In the 2018/19 season the mantle of leadership has fallen on the shoulders of Isuru Prabodha who is one of the finest bats. He bats at number three as a left hander. He scored over 700 runs last season and he has five seniors in the side. Once again Antonian Champika Siriwardene who was a right hand batsman for the Antonians from 1989 to 1991 will coach.

No proper training place
In Kandy today weightlifters and body builders have no proper place for their training. In the good old days Kandy YMCA, Mahanuwara YMBA gave a big hand, then also Municipal Community Centres. Today there a few gyms, though available they dont have the necessary materials. Also there are no proper volleyball, netball courts, basketball court for the poor sportsmen and women. Some schools have their own ones. The Ministry of Sports CP and Central Government should look into it and help the poor sportsmen and women.

Major project afoot to prevent flooding in Anuradhapura
Irrigation Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake has initiated a programme to prevent Malwathuoya River flooding.
The Minister said that for decades Malwathuoya has not been cleaned.
Invasive plants have spread along the river and fallen trees and sediment have blocked the river from Nachchaduwa to Thantirimale. Many people have encroached on river banks worsening the situation.
Now the first phase of the Malwathuoya Rehabilitation Project has commenced and clearing and broadening of the river is in progress.
The work of the first phase will be complete before the monsoon, the minister said. He said the pilot project is carried out under the theme 'anticipatory preparation before disaster'.
It will be the motto in disaster prevention, he said.
The lower Malwathuoya Reservoir Project is carried out now in the Thantirimale sacred area at a cost of Rs. 15,000 million to provide irrigation facilities for around 40,000 acres and to prevent the annual flooding.
The venture will cost the government Rs. 1,000 million, the Minister said.
The Disaster Management Ministry leads the clearing work along with the Irrigation Department and the Disaster Management Centre.
The Tri-forces, Civil Security Department and Prison Department provide manpower.
Irrigation engineers said the Malwathuoya River should be at least 80 metres wide.
Now its width is above 10-15 metres and it restricts the flowing of water causing flooding.

Pohottuwa protest a failure, says Deputy Minister Mannapperuma
The protest staged by a section of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) or Pohottuwa was a failure which reflects its rifts as well, Environment Deputy Minister Ajith Mannapperuma said.
He said that one of their aims is to defeat the government which was voted in by the people on January 8, 2015.
The people sent the destructive and betraying Rajapaksa regime home on January 8, the Deputy Minister said. People have clearly understood as to who the betrayers and destroyers are, Deputy Minister Mannapperuma said.
He further said the people did not participate in the protest and even MP Namal Rajapaksa is supposed to have left the protest early. The failure of the protest is that the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna has no leader other than a Rajapaksa, the Deputy Minister said.
He made these observations during a press conference at the United National Party Head Quarters at Sirikotha auditorium yesterday.
Deputy Minister Mannapperuma said that the previous government betrayed the War Heroes who won the war and celebrated the victory making it a victory of the Rajapaksas. But, this government honoured a War Hero like General Sartath Fonseka with the highest title Field Marshal.
MP Mahinda Rajapaksa said that we dont have the backbone to work, the Deputy Minister said.
Mannapperuma said that this government has no backbone to bring about dictatorship by destroying democracy. This government will not cancel the Independence Commissions but only strengthen them. We dont have backbone to replace the Chief Justice overnight in order to achieve any sinister ends, the Deputy Minister said.
We dont have backbone to organise car races around the Sacred Temple of the Tooth and to send white vans.
We too dont have backbone to attack prisoners in the Welikada Prison, the Deputy Minister said.
The Deputy Minister also said that this government has no backbone to evacuate the people from their houses forcefully like during the previous regime. This government also cant kill the innocent people asking for water like in Rathupaswala. He further said that this government has no backbone to kill fishermen who requested a reductio in the fuel price.
Deputy Minister Mannapperuma refuted the allegations made by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna protesters that the government is selling the country.
But, we havent sold any thing. Who sold the security headquarters premises outright to foreigners. Acres and acres from the Colombo Port city had been sold to foreigners etc. The people have understood it.
The Deputy Minister added that more than 115 investigations in to alleged malpractices by the former regime have been directed to the Attorney General and charges would be filed in the future.

Poulter leads Bridgestone with 62, Woods four back
Los Angeles, Thursday: Ian Poulter, gunning for a spot on the European Ryder Cup team, fired an eight-under par 62 on Thursday to grab the first-round lead in the World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio.
The English golfer, who won the Houston Open in April, had eight birdies without a bogey to hold a one-stroke lead over Americans Kyle Stanley and Rickie Fowler.
Eight-time Bridgestone winner Tiger Woods, Northern Ireland Star Rory McIlroy, former world number one Jason Day and US Open champion Brooks Koepka were among the 19 players within four strokes of Poulter on a talent-laden leaderboard.
My whole game was great today, said Poulter, who hit 12 of 14 fairways and 14 of 18 greens in regulation.
Whenever you shoot eight-under par youve generally done a lot of good stuff.
I did very well tee to green, proximity to the pin, I rolled a few nice putts in. As silly as it sounds, I would have liked to have nicked another couple. But any time you shoot eight-under par on this golf course its a great round of golf.
Poulter admitted he found extra motivation from his lack of success in previous trips to Firestone Country Club in Akron.
In his last six appearances his best finish was a tie for 17th in 2015.
I looked at my stats over the last 15 attempts at this place, and theyre not very good, he said. So today I was a bit more aggressive and it paid off.
After his lowest round ever on the PGA Tour, Poulter said a good change in mindset and a good cleanup from behind the scenes had contributed to a solid year that has seen him climb to 32nd in the world rankings.
Its a Ryder Cup year, he said. I want to play in it and I need to play some good golf.
Hell have to keep playing good golf to hold off a bevy of talented chasers.
Stanley set the early target with his 63, and he was joined at seven-under by a bogey-free Fowler.
Spains Jon Rahm, South Korean Kim Si-woo and American Patrick Cantlay shared fourth on 64.
McIlroy headed a group of six on 65 that also included Day, Indias Anirban Lahiri and American Justin Thomas -- who defends his PGA Championship title next week at the final major of the year.

A sound decision
When the duty structure on all vehicles except commercial vehicles was revised under the last Budget, taxes on small cars below 1,000 CC (1.0 litre) fell by around Rs. 300,000-400,000, which naturally made them more affordable. Imports of so-called Kei cars from Japan, with an engine capacity of 660 CC and other small cars increased uncontrollably as a result. There was a sudden influx of 660 CC models such as Suzuki Wagon R, Nissan Dayz, Honda N Box and Mitsubishi EK to the country. A combination of lower prices and easier leasing (with a down payment of only 30 percent) led to a massive surge in registrations of small cars including 1,000 CC cars such Toyota Vitz and Suzuki Swift. The statistics are indeed alarming  more than 5,500 cars and vans of 1,000 CC or less capacity have been imported each month from January to May 2018. Actual registrations were not far behind, with the Department of Motor Traffic (DMT) running through the new CBA and CBB series in record time.
However, it was clear from the beginning that this could not go on indefinitely. Only US$ 316 million was spent on vehicle imports for the first five months of 2017, but this had doubled to US$ 666 million in the first five months of this year. This is clearly untenable in the long term for a developing country which has many other priorities. Plus, this puts the Rupee and other sectors of the economy under further pressure, not to mention the extra fuel shipments needed to feed the additional vehicles. Needles to say, the effect on traffic and pollution also has to be considered.
Therefore, one cannot fault the Government for taking corrective steps, even if it means that at least some people who wanted to buy a car may not be able to do so or may have to opt for a lower priced model. Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has said the tax imposed on vehicles less than 1000cc was a move by the Treasury to cushion off the effect on the rupee and curb small vehicles imports. He said the roads were fast becoming congested and that imports were spiralling out of control. Describing it as a tsunami of small vehicles, the Minister added that it was high time imports were regulated.
The Minister signed a gazette notification to amend the excise duty of vehicles below 1000cc including hybrid vehicles effect from August. A unit tax of Rs 1.5 million will be applicable for a motor car below 1000cc while a unit tax of Rs 1.25 million will be levied for a hybrid electric car below 1000cc. Accordingly, prices will go up by Rs.300,000-425,000 on average. To be fair by the Finance Ministry, it has given a grace period for buyers and importers as these new taxes will not be applied to vehicles for which Letters of Credit have been opened before August 1, 2018 and cleared before January 31, 2019. Chances are that at least 10,000 vehicles will escape the new taxes due to this measure.
Given that at least 10,000 sub-1,000 cc vehicles are already available at hundreds of car sales centres islandwide, there should be no discernible effect on prices of small cars, which now range from around Rs.2.3 million-Rs.4.4 million, at least until end September. The authorities must ensure that car dealers do not jack up the prices of existing stocks unfairly, since the Government has given them a generous window to clear incoming stocks ordered before August 1.
In any case, the time has come to regulate the car imports undertaken especially by non-franchise dealers. Franchise dealers or sole agents representing various car makers keep only a small stock in hand and import stocks depending on customer orders. However, the non-franchise dealers or parallel importers import cars en masse and keep hundreds of them in their yards until customers turn up. There are even advertisements to effect that car sale X has 150 units of Brand Y Model Z for sale. Still, one often sees the same establishment importing 50 more units of the same brand and model without even finishing the existing stock. The authorities must devise a methodology where importers are not permitted to import more cars of the same brand and model until they entirely dispose of the existing stocks. This will prevent the unnecessary outflow of precious foreign exchange.
The DMT must be given a bigger say in the process of vehicle imports. It is time for Sri Lanka to have a more strict policy of Homologation, the process of certifying or approving vehicles to indicate that they meet regulatory standards and specifications, such as safety and technical requirements. Already, cars without Airbags and ABS brakes are not allowed into the country, as are cars that do not conform to the Euro IV emissions standards. In line with this decision, fuel standards were also raised recently to Euro IV. We need to be in tune with the latest trends in vehicle regulations to balance public aspirations and fiscal imperatives.

Top 10 Number-Three Batsmen in One Day Cricket of all time
Much like football, cricket too is a team sport, where each member is assigned a vital role as part of the teams game plan. If the openers role in cricket is to fend off the new ball and provide the opening salvo for their team, the number three is a pivotal position in the batting order and generally assigned to the most accomplished stroke maker. The number three batsman is responsible to play the sheet anchors role and build an innings. So the person in question has to be technically sound to stabilize the innings and also play the role of an aggressor if the situation demands.
Dependability and consistency have to be the forte of a number-three batsman. If we go into the history of ODI cricket, some of the batting legends of the game donned the number three position for their teams and went on to become the lynchpin of their batting orders.
So, it would be very interesting to compile a list of the all-time top 10 number-three batsmen who have played in that position in ODI cricket.
In this list, only those batsmen are considered who had a fairly long run playing at the number-three position and scored runs consistently for their teams. For this selection, only those batsmen have been taken who scored more than 2000 runs at an average of nearly 40, batting at the number-three position in One Day Internationals. Batsmen who were consistent run-getters with an impressive strike rate and penchant for scoring 100s definitely make a greater impact on their team and on the matches overall. Hence, they have been ranked higher on the list of the top ten number-three batsmen in the history of One Day Internationals.
Honourable Mentions:
India - Gautam Gambhir, Mohammad Azharuddin and Mohinder Amarnath
Pakistan - Zaheer Abbas, Ijaz Ahmed and Mohammad Yousuf
Sri Lanka - Marvan Atapattu and Asanka Gurusinha
West Indies - Richie Richardson, Ramnaresh Sarwan and Shivnarine Chanderpaul
England - Graeme Hick, Jonathan Trott and Ian Bell
South Africa - Hansie Cronje and Faf Du Plessis
New Zealand - Stephen Fleming
Australia - Dean Jones
KANE WILLIAMSON
Kane Williamson has been hailed as New Zealands greatest ODI batsman after Martin Crowe. The supremely gifted Williamson has been Kiwis standout batsman at the number three position. Kane has all the shots in his armoury and scores his runs at a brisk pace. The Black Caps had to wait for a dependable number three after Stephen Flemings retirement from ODIs and Williamson put up his hands to take up the pivotal position in the batting lineup.
Kane is equally adept against pace or spin and his calm temperament helps him occupy the crease and play the long innings for the Black Caps in the limited overs cricket.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 95 Runs 4404 Avg 50.62 SR 84.20 100s 9
JOE ROOT
Joe Root has been Englands batting lynch-pin in the middle order. Root has been superbly consistent for England in white ball cricket. With his orthodox technique and textbook strokes, he is the ideal man for England to have at the crucial number three position.
The Yorkshire cricketer likes to start his innings steadily and then launches into the opposition bowling. Besides being at ease against seamers, Root has good footwork and plays spin well. His calming presence helps the likes of Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler to accelerate for England in the middle and later stages of an innings.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 54 Runs 2665 Avg 61.97 SR 91.32 100s 9
INZAMAM UL HAQ
The gentle giant from Pakistan had loads of patience and composure batting at number three for Pakistan. Inzi made batting look effortless with his lazy elegance. He had the ability to play the ball late and was a master at milking the singles.
A master at reading the game situation, Haq could pace his innings to perfection and took his team across the finishing line more often than not. A natural ball striker, Haq looked at his best when he sent spinners for massive sixes straight down the ground.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 61 Runs 2033 Avg 39.09 SR 68.54 100s 2
RAHUL DRAVID
Rahul Dravid was the lynch-pin of the Indian middle order in ODIs for almost two decades. Jammy had a watertight technique and a rock solid defence to fend off potent attacks. While Sachin and Ganguly provided the opening salvo, Dravid was the ideal number 3 batsman who consolidated the breezy starts and built a solid platform for the Men in Blue.
Whenever the openers fell early, Dravid, also known as The Wall, was equal to the task in rebuilding the innings. He played the sheet anchors role to perfection and quietly went about his run-scoring business. In seam-friendly conditions abroad, Dravid became an impregnable wall in the Indian middle order which was hard for the oppositions bowling attack to breach.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 112 Runs 4000 Avg 38.83 SR 69.60 100s 7
VIVIAN RICHARDS
Sir Vivian Richards was arguably one of the best number three ODI batsmen of all time. Richards was way ahead of his time with transformed the way ODI cricket was played with his enthralling strokeplay. A stocky built attacking batsman, Richards could tear apart the best of bowling with utter disdain. He became West Indies staple Number 3 batsman and spearheaded a power-packed Windies middle order comprising of fellow stalwarts like Alvin Kallicharran, Larry Gomes, Clive Lloyd, Gus Logie, Collis Kings and Jeffrey Dujon.
Richards had all the shots in his armoury and executed them to perfection. Richards accumulated over 2000 runs at a staggering 50 plus average with a strike rate of over 85. In a nutshell, the mere presence of Richards at the crease was demoralizing for the opposition bowling camp.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 52 Runs 2418 Avg 57.57 SR 86.88 100s 5
JACQUES KALLIS
Jacques Kallis was South Africas perennial number three batsman for almost two decades in ODI cricket. Kallis was an accomplished ODI batsman with a classical defence, assured footwork and wide array of shots. Kallis was Proteas batting mainstay and steered their ship in the middle order. His consistency at run scoring was unmatched and a staggering ODI average of over 45 is testimony to the same.
A well-organised technique with an upright stance was the signature of Kallis elegant batting. He rarely failed and became South Africas batting workhorse during the reigns of Hansie Cronje and Graeme Smith.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 204 Runs 7774 Avg 45.72 SR 73.74 100s 13
KUMARA SANGAKKARA
Kumara Sangakkara was arguably Sri Lankas most dependable ODI batsman for almost two decades. Sangakkara made the number three position his own and attached a prize to his wicket. Consistency was his forte and he delivered the goods with the willow. Be it exquisite timing or great balance, Sanga had all the hallmarks of an elegant stroke maker.
Bestowed with a calm head, Sangakkara could grind oppositions with his waiting game and also lodge into attacks with relative ease. The Sri Lankan batting maestro formed a lethal partnership with Mahela Jayawardene in the middle order and made Sri Lanka one of the most potent batting units in the limited overs arena.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 243 Runs 9747 Avg 44.71 SR 80.50 100s 18
VIRAT KOHLI
Virat Kohli has established himself as one of the most prolific run-getters in ODI cricket. The Indian skippers run-scoring pedigree runs short of superlatives. Kohli owns the number three spot with his phenomenal consistency at notching up big scorers. A master at chasing down daunting totals, Kohli takes the onus of taking the team across the finishing line with his pedigree of scoring match-winning tons. Kohlis batting is more on the conventional lines and he plays risk-free shots to compile a near to error-free innings.
Kohlis art of pacing his innings makes him a class apart from other batsmen. He has led the ODI run-scoring charts for a couple of seasons and is hailed as the best batsman in white ball cricket. Above all, he is an extremely ambitious cricketer with a burning desire to do well for the Men in Blue.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 152 Runs 7686 Avg 61.48 SR 93.23 100s 28
BRIAN LARA
One of the most enthralling stroke makers to grace the Gentlemans game, Brian Lara certainly established himself as dependable number three for the Windies for the most part of the 90s. Lara was a fans delight with his encapsulating high backlift and a typical Calypso late shuffle across the stumps.
The Prince from Trinidad looked regal with his flourishing drives and late cuts. With the West Indies not having a stable opening combination in ODIs, a lot of onus fell on Lara to construct the innings. An outright match winner on his day, Lara could make batting look easy with some breath-taking innings. A select few batsmen had the ability to play pace and spin with the same ease, Lara was one of them.
ODI Record Batting at Number 3
Matches 109 Runs 4447 Avg 45.84 SR 85.98 100s 12
RICKY PONTING
Ricky Ponting was one of the most aggressive stroke makers in one day cricket. Ponting encashed on the opening exploits of Hayden-Gilchrist combination and provided impetus to the Australian middle order. A quality player against fast bowling, Ponting could flay away attacks with his belligerent strokeplay. Arguably the best exponent of the pull shot, Ricky looked vintage while pulling the seamers with full command.
A prolific run-getter with a penchant to score the big match winning hundreds, Punter spearheaded an impregnable Australian middle order which comprised of fellow stalwarts like Damien Martyn, Darren Lehmann, Michael Clarke, Andrew Symonds and Michael Hussey.

Top 5 greatest fast bowlers of all time
Fast bowling is quite possibly the most exciting thing in the game of cricket. It is an adrenaline-pumping and enjoyable aspect of the game which keeps the spectators occupied and delights them. It is always fun to see the ball hurled at over 90 miles per hour at the batsmen, though it might not be as enjoyable for the batsman himself. Still, fast bowling is not about raw pace only. It is also about accuracy and outwitting the batsman.
Over the decades, cricket has been graced by some great fast bowlers who have enthralled us with their pace, accuracy and guile. The list of great fast bowlers is really long and it is not easy to choose the top 5 from such a long list. Still, we have managed to come up with our top 5 and would like to take a look at them:
5. WASIM AKRAM (PAKISTAN)
There has probably never been a cricketer as talented as Wasim Akram. He had all the attributes a great cricketer should have. Moreover, he was quite possibly the most versatile fast bowler of all time. He could swing the ball both ways, could bowl with an upright seam, was quick enough and had a lethal yorker. He was a great exponent of the reverse swing also and could be deadly with the old ball.
Akrams record speaks for itself. He took 414 wickets in 104 test matches at an average of 23. His strike rate was just a shade below 55. Akram also took 502 ODI wickets, the highest by a fast bowler. Akram was able to maintain an economy rate below 4 throughout his ODI career.
He performed superbly in all conditions and on every kind of surface. He destroyed England in their own backyard with his superb swing bowling, pinned down West Indies in West Indies with his guile and accuracy, troubled Australia in Australia with his raw pace and bounce and remained a champion bowler on his home turf. Akram was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 30 but he continued to play till the age of 37. He reduced his run-up and depended more upon his accuracy and experience in the latter part of his career. He was also a great sight to look at and had a smooth, effortless bowling action
4. SIR RICHARD HADLEE (NEW ZEALAND)
Sir Richard Hadlee was the most accurate fast bowler of all time. He was also probably the most intelligent of them all. He had a lethal out swinger and the ability to out think the batsmen. If there was ever a thinking fast bowler, it was Sir Richard.
Hadlee was the first bowler to break the 400 test wicket barrier and went on to take 431 wickets in 86 test matches. His destruction of Australia in the 1985-86 test series remains one of the finest ever performance by a fast bowler in a test series. The conditions in New Zealand allowed Hadlee to use his swing bowling prowess to the fullest extent. Although he did not have express speed, he was fast enough to trouble the bastmen.
Hadlee boasted a strike rate of 51 and a bowling average below 23. He also took 158 ODI wickets at an economy rate below 4. He was very difficult to score off as he could quite literally put the ball on a coin. Hadlee won quite a few test matches single-handedly for New Zealand in his illustrious career. The fact that he was the only world-class bowler in the Kiwi team did not deter him and he kept on improving as a bowler.
3. GLENN MCGRATH (AUSTRALIA)
Glenn McGrath was a bowler of metronomic accuracy and single-minded focus. He was a fierce competitor who always wanted to win his battles against the batsmen. He also preferred to keep things simple and stick to the basics. He put the ball in the right areas consistently and waited for the batsmen to commit errors, which they did frequently.
McGrath was almost peerless in terms of statistics also. He took 563 wickets in 124 test matches which made him the most successful fast-bowler in the history of the game. He had an amazing average of 21.64 and an equally great strike rate of 51.90. His ODI record was stupendous too as he took 381 wickets at an economy rate below 4.
McGrath never relied on pace and his bowling speed hovered around the 85 mph mark. Being 6 feet 5 inches tall, he was very effective with his bouncers too. He formed a deadly partnership with fellow great Shane Warne and the pair won Australia numerous test matches. He was also a part of the most successful cricket team of all time as Australia dominated world cricket throughout the 1990s and 2000s. McGraths relentless accuracy and winning mentality was one of the reasons behind that success.
2. MALCOLM MARSHALL (WEST INDIES)
There was nothing that Malcolm Marshall could not do with a cricket ball. He could swing the ball both ways, bowl devastating cutters, bounce the batsmen out, terrorize them with raw pace and bog them down with his accuracy. He was successful on all kinds of pitches and playing conditions. He was also a part of the fearsome pace quartet of the great West Indian side.
Marshalls strike rate was below 47 and bowling average less than 21. He took 376 test wickets in 81 matches and no other fast bowler can boast of such phenomenal record. He also took more than 150 ODI wickets and was one of the major reasons behind West Indies dominance throughout the 1980s.
Many fast bowlers are not able to perform well on the dry and lifeless pitches of the sub-continent but Marshall was an exception in this regard also. He was instrumental in destroying India 3-0 in a test series played in India just after the 1983 World Cup. Marshall also ran through the English batting line-up several times in his career and boasted a wonderful record against all test playing countries. He could bowl at more than 90 mph but reduced his pace in the latter part of his career to depend more on his versatility.
1. DENNIS LILLEE (AUSTRALIA)
Dennis Lillee remains the benchmark for fast-bowling excellence till date. He was eulogized and idolized by his contemporaries and followers alike. Marshall described him as the greatest fast bowler of all time, Hadlee idolized him and another fellow great Imran Khan also thought him to be incomparable. He quite literally remains the Godfather of all fast bowlers.
Lillee took 355 test wickets in only 70 matches at an average below 24. He also had an outstanding strike rate of 48 and was the first fast bowler to cross the 350 wickets mark. Lillee played in only 63 ODIs and took 103 wickets at an economy rate of 3.6. But mere stats cannot do justice to his phenomenal effect on the game. He formed a legendary partnership with fellow Aussie pacer Jeff Thompson and the pair tormented all the other test playing nations, especially arch rivals England.
Lillee had a beautiful outswinger and a very effective inswinger. He was a great proponent of seam bowling and had a deadly bouncer. He was a tearaway fast bowler in the initial days of his career but became a very intelligent bowler in course of time. He developed great accuracy and versatility as his career progressed and had become a master of his trade in course of time. He reduced his run-up and started flummoxing the batsmen with his craftiness. Lillee could also bowl a very nice cutter which made him very effective with the old ball. He was a complete package and remains the epitome of fast-bowling greatness.

Updated land use policy to address climate change
According to the World Weather Chart, Sri Lanka is listed in the fourth place among countries subjected to worst climate change.
Improper land use has been one factor which contributed to this situation.
As such, land use policy needs to be updated and agricultural construction and other activities should be pursued accordingly, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said.
The minister was addressing a meeting following the opening of the Gampaha district new land use planning office building, recently.
The Department of Land Use Policy Planning has built the new building at a cost of Rs. 12 million to replace the dilapidated old building of the Gampaha office.
The minister said unnecessary expenditure involved in functions could be prevented by conducting the opening ceremony, distribution of land title deeds and the discussion with state officials, including divisional secretaries and members of the political authority, all in one single day at the same venue.
Minister Karunatilleke said the Gampaha district, encompassing 1,177 Grama Niladhari divisions, had a 2.3 million population.
Although the population rapidly increased, the extent of land available did not increase. As such, available land needs to be used in a pragmatic and fruitful manner for agriculture and plantation as well as residential use.
Marsh as well as forest land should be properly managed to ensure sustainable development and attain successful land use.
The fully equipped office building opened would make a great contribution in this regard.
The minister said the office could also provide guidance to people on proper land use by conducting a model home garden and model forest cultivation on its grounds. This would help boost the governments policy of increasing the forest cover from 29 percent to 32 percent of the land area.
He said the Cabinet approval was received to amend the old and obsolete land use policy formulated in 2007 in keeping with modern trends and needs.
After receiving the Cabinet approval, they are now planning to promote sustainable development in collaboration with other government departments and institutions.
Minister Karunatilleke said the distribution of land title deeds would also be accelerated in the Gampaha district under the government's one million land title deeds distribution programme.
Accordingly, 1,200 title deeds would be granted by October in the Gampaha district.
He said the Land Commissioner General's Department is taking steps to regularise the 1,280 irregular land title deeds given to the people in Rajapaksapura in Katana.
A large extent of land in Attanagalla would also be allocated for the Housing Ministry's housing project to resolve the housing problem of people in the area.

Waratahs extend Gibson contract, Whitaker returns
Sydney, Friday: Daryl Gibson has been given a one-year contract extension as NSW Waratahs coach, the club said Friday, after a remarkable season that saw him lead the team to the Super Rugby semi-finals.
Gibson, who has been in charge of the Sydney club for three seasons, will be assisted by former Wallabies scrumhalf Chris Whitaker as Chris Malone departs after three years.
Whitaker, who raked up 107 caps for the Tahs between 1997 and 2006, is returning to the harbour city after two years as co-head coach of French club Montauban, and stints with Stade Francais and Irish club side Leinster. The knowledge and experience you gain overseas is great but it is time for me to come home and contribute to the game and a state that has given so much to me and my family throughout my career, Whitaker said in a statement.
Rugby in Australia is improving and I couldnt pass on the chance to help further develop and grow the potential we have here. Gibson said he was proud of the teams achievements over the past year, and that he was excited about whats to come.
He also bid farewell to assistant coach Malone, who has finished up with the club after the losing semi-final clash with the Lions in Johannesburg last weekend. AFP

Weeping Murray wins marathon, rips ATP event for 3:00 am finish
Washington, Friday: A tearful Andy Murray advanced to the ATP Washington Open quarter-finals in a three-hour marathon ending at 3:00 am Friday, then ripped organizers for putting him in such a situation.
Three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, in his first hardcourt event after an 11-month layoff for a right hip injury, outlasted Romanias 93rd-ranked Marius Copil 6-7 (5/7), 6-3, 7-6 (7/4).
The 31-year-old Scotsman won his third three-set victory in four days, having been on the court for eight hours 11 minutes in all, and he started at midnight thanks to a fourth day of rain delays.
I dont think I should be put in a position like that, Murray said. (My body) doesnt feel great right now.
Ive had a few long matches. Finishing matches at three in the morning isnt good for anyone involved in the event, players, TV, fans, anyone.
When youre expected to come back and perform the next day, I think thats unreasonable.
And the sheer lateness of the hour wasnt good for players.
Thats something the tour needs to look at, Murray said.
The British star said he was unlikely to finish post-match conditioning and get to sleep before 5:30 am, ahead of a scheduled Friday quarter-final against 19-year-old Australian Alex De Minaur.
Not playing, potentially, is possible. I dont know how players are expected to recover from that, Murray said.
Its like playing two matches in a day. Im not sure how well Ill recover from that.
After the final point, Murray went to his chair, buried his face in a towel and wept, sobbing at times, and kept his head down and face covered as he exited the court.
Not a whole lot, really, the emotions coming out at the end of an extremely long day and a long match, Murray said of what made him so emotional.
Former world number one Murray, now ranked 832, denied Copil on all four break chances in the first set and took a 5-0 tie-breaker lead only to drop the next seven points and squander the set, yelling at himself several times before netting a backhand to end the misery.
Murray broke to open and close the second set, then traded breaks in the sixth and seventh games on the way to a final tie-breaker.
Murray hit a forehand long to fall level 3-3, then slammed his racquet to the court, recovered it and hit three winners to reach match point, winning when Copil netted a backhand.
If his body can take it, Murray plays for a semi-final spot in Fridays last match against 72nd-ranked De Minaur, who pulled two upsets Thursday after rain, dumping US 11th seed Steve Johnson 6-4, 7-5 and South Korean eighth seed Chung Hyeon 6-2, 4-6, 6-2. AFP

Why Test cricket continues to charm
Fifty-two hours, 34 minutes. Just over 2 days. This is the end-to-end time that one gentleman took to fly around the whole world in scheduled commercial flights. Meanwhile, some Test matches don't even let you know which team has the upper hand in the first 2 days.
"[...] the international blood of other countries be sucked dry by England in trying to keep alive the out-moded, incongruous county cricket system" - this was Jack Fingleton in 1969, worrying about how County cricket contracts would destroy Tests. It is almost 50 years now and Test cricket is still hanging around.
So what is it about Test cricket, a seemingly anachronistic format of the game, that has ensured its survival over the past 140 years In my opinion, it is owing to 4 major reasons.
BOWLERS STILL CALL THE SHOTS HERE
4 slips, 2 gullies, a short leg and a silly point. With a skilful pacer steaming in while the batsman pushes and prods nervously. The sight of a bowler, a quick or a spinner, terrorising the batsman is something that generations of cricket lovers have savoured. Be it Fred Trueman when he reduced India to 0/4 in 1952, Curtly Ambrose taking 7 wickets for 1 run against Australia in 1993 or Boult-Southee dismantling England for 58 this year at Eden Park.
Yes, we love to see a batsman flamboyantly driving the ball to the cover boundary. But the delight is multiplied when it is against such attacking bowling and fielding. The bowler is at liberty to set the field that he chooses, unlike limited overs cricket where he must bow to fielding restrictions. There is the possibility of swing, reverse swing and spin of varying degrees. In short, Test cricket provides room for a thrilling clash between the personas of batsman and bowler.
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS OFFER DIFFERENT CHALLENGES
A champion batsman on the turners of the subcontinent may well prove to be a disappointment in the swinging conditions of a Trent Bridge match. Jimmy Anderson is a beast at home, but not an insurmountable threat outside. Herath can fox the best in Sri Lanka but has not been as successful outside. Different locations and tracks provide the chance for new heroes. Rare is the batsman or bowler who performs splendidly everywhere. Of course, exceptions such as a certain D W Steyn exist.
This is the major reason why the ratio of away teams winning Test matches has stayed in the range of 20-30% for the past 100 years. The variety of turn, swing, bounce that each venue provides adds to its attached history and gives it context. It cannot be always said which of 2 teams is better. South Africa drubbed Sri Lanka 3-0 at home but were thrashed 2-0 in Sri Lanka. This makes it harder for a team to be universally accepted as the best; to be the greatest Test team, the team must truly be special.
DOES NOT DEMAND CONSTANT ATTENTION
The very factor that makes Test cricket seem out of date is also what makes it most endearing. The fact that one does not need to be always glued in. Other team sports merit constant attention. Bat an eyelid and Germany may have scored 5 goals against Brazil. Not so with Tests. You could doze off for an entire session and still see the same 2 chaps batting away merrily, perhaps even the same 2 bowlers. Test cricket allows you the liberty of following it along with doing multiple other things. This also means that one could follow half the match via Tweets, skip a few sessions and yet watch the thrilling last session. In the fast-paced world of today, that is a source of comfort indeed. To be able to plug in and out and yet not be left out.
AN ABUNDANCE OF TIME FORCES THE MOST EFFORT FROM PLAYERS
"Because in my humble opinion, a hard-fought five-day Test match remains the greatest all-round challenge in modern day sport. A challenge as mentally demanding as it is physical. A challenge demanding the very highest levels of concentration of technique, of determination, of stamina, all, for the batsman at least, with no second chances." These are not the words of W G Grace; these are the words of the forerunner of modern cricket, Kevin Pietersen.
Imagine a T20 match where the batsman has scored only 6 runs in the past 2 overs. One senses that something will give. The batsman will invariably go for a hoick and the bowler's chance will come. Not so in Tests.
Time is not forcing the batsman to go for the big shots and make an error in the process. A wicket can only be extracted by the skill and guile of the bowler and his team. Likewise, a batsman cannot hope to play a couple of overs, score a quickfire 20 and then depart with the feeling of a job well done. He has to stay put for dozens of overs, against various bowlers and various times of the day. Time running out will never be an acceptable excuse for him throwing away his wicket. In a nutshell, Test cricket demands patience. And a player's lack or abundance of it is conspicuous for one and all to see.
All these reasons sum up why Test cricket continues to retain its own special spot in the hearts of cricket lovers!  sk

The Court of Appeal decided to consider preliminary objections raised by Minister Bathiudeen and others at an appropriate time.
The respondents were directed to file their objections on September 28.

The petitioners stated that natural reserved forests are protected by law and are being administered by the Conservator General of Forests and no such forest can be used for any other purpose with strict penal sanctions provided by law against violations.
The petitioners stated that the Villattikulam reserved forests has 2108 hectares of forest cover as per the regulations framed under Section 3 of the Forest Ordinance and published in the Government Gazette No 1759/2 of May 21,2012 and law prohibits abuse of any such reserved forest and the state is under duty to protect such forests from any form of exploitation.
The petitioners further stated that Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen's powers, duties and functions as assigned by the Executive President had been duly published in the government gazette and the said assigned powers and duties do not include any power or authority to engage in appropriation of forests lands for human settlement, clearing of such lands and erecting of houses in the forest land appropriated by unlawful means. The petitioners further stated that on May 7, 2009 on a presidential directive, 19 member Presidential Task Force (PTF) for resettlement of internally displaced persons in the Northern Province, was formulated with Basil Rajapaksa appointed as the chairman.
