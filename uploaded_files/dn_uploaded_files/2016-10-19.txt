Injury prevention the biggest challenge in cricket

One of the commonest problems in cricket is the injuries sustained by players especially the fast bowlers.
The recovery period from injury is so small that sufficient time is not given for the injury to heal completely and as a result it recurs after a short period of time thus making it frustrating for the injured player himself as well as the captain, coaching staff and the national selectors.
Sri Lanka are due to play their first Test against Zimbabwe in Harare on October 29  ten days from today, but so far the squad for the two Tests has yet to be announced due to the fact that the national selectors are grappling with injuries to some of the players.
Injuries to fast bowlers are not common only to Sri Lanka, but it is worldwide because unlike the good old days when there was plenty of time between Test matches (they even had a rest day during a Test), today there is great emphasis being laid by Cricket Boards to play more matches with little time between matches. This is because of the commercialism that has crept into the sport and the money generated from it is too big a temptation to ignore. The advent of T20 cricket has only compounded the problem by increasing the number of matches played during a tour and crowded the international cricket fixtures to such an extent that there is hardly any breathing space.
In this scenario a player getting injured has less chance to recover and it gets highlighted by the number of matches or series he is missing due to the injury. It was not the case some years ago when the international cricket calendar was not so crowded and players had sufficient time to recover.
The cause of injuries to players occurring consistently is also due to the fact that they are over worked and tend to break down. The injuries are common with fast bowlers because they are the ones who put in the maximum effort on the cricket field compared to other areas in the sport. The demand from a fast bowler is so great that unless he is physically strong he is bound to break down consistently.
Sri Lanka are still struggling to get their spearhead in Test cricket Dhammika Prasad back on track. He suffered a shoulder injury in May during the tour of England and has been out of action since. The same problem persists for Sri Lanka with their most potent short format (50-over and T20) weapon for several years Lasith Malinga who is struggling to recover from a bone bruise to his left knee he sustained during West Indies tour of Sri Lanka last November. Further 24-year-old Dushmantha Chameera, regarded as the likely successor to Malinga has also been out of action since the England tour in May suffering from a stress fracture to his lower back. The only two fast bowlers available Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep have also had their share of injuries on and off but not to the extent of the other three. However the consistent break downs to players throws the carefully laid out plans against an opposition completely out of the window, and it is reflected on the performances on the field.
In their last Test series against Australia at home, with injuries to their key fast bowlers Sri Lanka opted to prepare spin oriented pitches which suited their spinners Rangana Herath, Dilruwan Perera and Lakshan Sandakan who bowled the team to a rare 3-0 whitewash against the then number one ranked Test side.
But now with tours to Zimbabwe and South Africa lined up in the next five months the emphasis will be on pace for which Sri Lanka are ill-equipped at the moment due to the spate of injuries. How they can overcome this setback is the key.
Dr Peter Brukner, the Australian cricket team doctor analysed that there are probably three main factors that contribute to the high risk of injuries in young fast bowlers: age, technique and workload.
History tells us that bowlers under the age of 24 are at increased risk of developing lumbar stress fractures, presumably because their bones have not fully matured and lack the necessary strength to withstand the high loads imparted on them by bowling at 140km/h.
Over the past 50 years, wrote Dr Brukner, a long line of young Australian fast bowlers have broken down, from Dennis Lillee and Bruce Reid to the present group. Only Craig McDermott in that period has been able to play at a young age at Test level without injury.
The role of technique in the development of lumbar stress fractures has been studied since the 1970s when a West Australian group led by Daryl Foster and Bruce Elliot determined that a mixed side-on/front-on action was the most likely to lead to bone stress. Nowadays, it is the degree of counter-rotation that is measured. It is obviously difficult to make drastic changes to techniques at this level, but minor tweaking is attempted after video analysis to reduce the degree of counter-rotation.
The bowling load of these players is monitored very closely. Total numbers of balls bowled at training and in games is planned as much as possible ahead of time and adjusted according to circumstances. What we particularly try to avoid is rapid increases in the number of balls bowled from week to week. We like a steady progression.
Playing consecutive matches regularly with high bowling workloads and without significant rest periods places our young fast bowlers at significantly higher risk for injury, hence the very reasonable Cricket Australia effort to avoid this with a rotation policy, as it is dubbed by the media. It is a very sensible plan to reduce the risk of these injuries.
It seems that CA gets slammed for resting players and being unable to prevent the injuries. It cant win.
CA has a very experienced and knowledgeable sports medicine and sports science staff consisting of sport physicians, physiotherapists and massage therapists. Managing our fast bowlers is the biggest challenge we have, wrote Dr Brukner.
