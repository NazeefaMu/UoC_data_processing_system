## Title: Trade Adjustment Package discussion paper prepared

Trade Adjustment Package discussion paper prepared
The Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry has come up with a draft of a trade adjustment package to safeguard the welfare of workers and improve the competitiveness of firms to mitigate the potential negative impacts of trade liberalisation.
The draft paper published on Wednesday is open for stakeholder comments till August 23 and is available on the website modsit.gov.lk.
The proposed Trade Adjustment Programme (TAP) is to smoothen the transition of firms and workers to the new market conditions created by trade liberalisation. It provides protection for workers and firms who are likely to be affected by free trade agreements.
The paper identifies trade liberalisation through removal of para-tariffs, rationalisation of tariffs, and bilateral trade liberalisation through FTAs as a much needed and long overdue move. Through the TAP, firms and workers who are likely to be affected will be reallocated to new and productive sectors.
Several sectors which are labour-intensive face a high level of protection, and so increased international competition following from trade liberalisation can impact wages and jobs. Labour market regulations in the country are still rigid, which heighten the difficulties for firms to respond dynamically to the new conditions and for workers to move more smoothly across industries, the draft paper analyses.
The paper advices the Government to support local firms to enhance production capacity, venture into new markets, adjust current production to move from one line of business to another, and access new technology to upgrade their products and production processes parallel to trade liberalization process.
The paper recommends the establishment of a Trade and Productivity Commission (TPC) to be the independent body that analyses TAP alongside the trade liberalisation process.
The Commission will investigate and respond to industry requests on tariff phase out. The TPC will consist of independent Commissioners possibly appointed by the Constitutional Council. The paper observes that the Governments National Export Strategy and the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy are integral to the TAP. The National Export Strategy provides a focused programme for 6 priority sectors to grow their exports and become more competitive.
Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy provides the platform for existing and new enterprises to innovate and become resilient.
Additionally, new schemes launched by the GovernmentEnterprise Sri Lanka and the Market Access Support Scheme also provide specific financial support to firms looking to expand, improve innovation and productivity, and develop new products to new standards, it adds.
The recommendations mentioned in the paper include making the labour market more flexible to smoothen adjustment, accelerating investment attraction to create new jobs for workers who will be displaced, establishing an Independent Commission to evaluate and recommend assistance, slower tariff phase-out and regional job training centres and job placement services. It also proposes to establish Industry Competitiveness Councils to address industry-specific constraints. The proposed Industry Competitiveness Councils are not intended to provide subsidies or special treatment to compensate for low profitability. This institutional framework helps the Government not to give ad-hoc assistance without a proper mechanism, as it could create more inefficiencies, misallocation of resources and waste tax payers money. The idea is not to pick winners, as in the traditional industrial policy schemes but for firms to be ready to compete with international standards, the paper explains.
The analytical work conducted by the World Bank (together with Verite Research) and the Center for International Development of Harvard University has been considered in preparing draft paper.
Consultation sessions have been held with officials of the Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Ministry, and members of leading chambers of commerce and industry to prepare the draft.

84 players, four teams: SLC launches its T20 League

Sri Lanka Cricket launched their T20 League and finalized the 84 players for the tournament at a special media conference held at Jaic Hilton yesterday.
Of significant note was the exclusion of experienced T20 players like Chamara Kapugedara, Seekkuge Prasanna, Dilshan Munaweera, Sachithra Senanayake, Milinda Siriwardene and Nuwan Kulasekara.
Meanwhile Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera and Suranga Lakmal have been appointed to lead Colombo, Kandy, Dambulla and Galle teams respectively in the tournament which will run from 21 August to 2 September..
Former captain Mahela Jayawardene slammed SLC and the selection committee for neglecting the senior players. Jayawardene tweeted: Very tough to understand the policy this is what
happens when national selectors select provincial teams. Thats why you need provincial selectors on the different structure. You need experienced players for the youngsters to learn.
An official revealed that the selection portrayed that the senior players who were not selected for the tournament seemed to have ended their international careers as they were not even selected for a domestic T20 league.
Speaking at the press conference selection committee member Eric Upashantha said: We have given a lot of opportunities to the youngsters and playing with seniors help the youngsters to develop their standard.
CEO Ashley de Silva added that regarding the selections not only Sachithra there are so many other senior players who were not selected because they wanted to include more juniors players to get experience in the T20 format. The teams were selected by the national selectors Jerry Woutersz, Eric Upashantha, Gamini Wickramasinghe and Graeme Labrooy. There are 21 players in each squad for the tournament. Each team will play six games in the round-robin stage with the top two teams in the points table qualifying for the final.
The Galle Team will be coached by Roy Dias, the Colombo Team by Avishka Gunawardena, Kandy Team by Piyal Wijetunga and Dambulla Team by Sumithra Waranakulasuriya.
The Managers for the 4 teams are Gajaba Pitigala (Colombo), Priyantha Udayaratne (Kandy), Vinothen John (Dambulla) and Nalinda Illangakoon (Galle).

All tanks in the island will be renovated to provide water for farmers in the Yala and Maha seasons, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing the gathering at the inauguration of the Wew Dahasak, Gam Dahasak rural development programme at Kailawelpotwa in Agunakolapelessa.
The Minister said the successive regimes never renovated tanks. The programme implemented in Agunakolapelessa was the 300 under Wew Dahask, Gam Dahasak programme.
He said that many tanks remain overgrown with aquatic plants and filled up to the brim with mud and even thunder showers cannot fill them. He said farmers never ask for anything else but water. It is our bounden duty to address the issue, he said.
The Minister said the Joint Opposition was fighting for the premiership.
Now they are trying their best to get the Post of Opposition Leader. They pledged that they will topple the Yahapalana regime after a couple of poya days but still they have not done it since they cannot defeat farsighted policies of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the Minister said.

The case for political unity
Three years ago on August 17, 2015, Sri Lankans reaffirmed their commitment to democracy and good governance by giving an overwhelming mandate to the Rainbow Coalition to govern for five years. Just a few months earlier, they voted for a radical transformation in the countrys trajectory by voting for Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena to become President. The nascent Government formed in January 2015 sought a public mandate for a renewed term, which was granted. The new Government began work exactly three years ago, on August 18, 2015.
This was a Government with a difference. For nearly 65 years after independence, the two major parties  SLFP and UNP  had governed in turn. Political analysts called it Thattu Maaru in Sinhalese, which essentially means that they governed the country one after the other. But this had the disadvantage of being based entirely on political imperatives, not national ones. This is why the Government that came into being on January 8, 2015 was different  for the first time ever the two major parties were in a formal ruling coalition. This gave rise to the name National Unity Government. In a way, this also depicted the need for national unity after the political and social polarization that stemmed from the 30-year conflict.
The departing Mahinda Rajapaksa Government had altered the countrys fundamental governing structure to such an extent that many remained pessimistic whether the new Government would be able to change anything at all. It was a dark era in which fundamental freedoms and even the Judiciary were trampled. The Police and law enforcement agencies had to dance to the tune of the Government. Critics of the Government were made to disappear courtesy of the White Vans. True, the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government ended the long-running war, but failed to win the peace with its triumphalist attitude and antagonistic approach to Human Rights. It eschewed reconciliation and promoted division, discord and rancour. One adverse result of this course of action was the countrys almost total isolation in the International Community, with only a few equally nefarious regimes backing it up.
In this light, the incoming Government had a tall order. Its first priority was to set things right in terms of governance. Hence the term Good Governance Government, an alternative term for the National Unity Government. It is the Sinhala interpretation Yahapalanaya that caught on and eventually entered the local political lexicon. Whatever the name, the task at hand was daunting  set the country on the right path after years of being in the doldrums.
To its credit, the Government has accomplished this task with aplomb. By establishing independent commissions and also by creating a general climate of freedom sans fear and suspicion, the Government has restored the independence of the Judiciary and the Police, upheld the supremacy of law, bolstered an independent public service and above all, granted full freedom of expression for all including the media. It is also cracking down on all forms of corruption  in fact, it is the only Government in recent memory that probed acts of corruption that occurred during its own term. Taken together, this alone is an achievement worthy of celebration. Indeed, the restoration of media freedom, with a total stop on attacks and disappearances of media personnel, has often been cited as the most important achievement of the Good Governance Government by the International Community.
Today, Sri Lanka has become a fully fledged member of the International Community, thanks to the Governments constructive engagement with the rest of the world. Instead of confrontation, the Government opted for a dialogue on matters such as human rights and post-conflict accountability. The International Community has accepted this approach and given the Government the time and space to resolve such issues through a domestic mechanism, which will go a long way towards achieving reconciliation among the different communities. The Government has launched an active reconciliation mechanism to bring the North and the South together in order to achieve lasting peace.
The previous Government made a huge show of development which was in reality riddled with corruption. However, this Government has embarked on a huge development drive without the element of corruption  from the giant Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga project to the Light Rail Transit (LRT) system in Colombo suburbs. Realisng that developing the big cities alone will not equate to development, the Government has launched two rural development programmes that will cover the entire island  Grama Shakthi and Gam Peraliya. The village is at the heart of our primarily agricultural nation and these two programmes will be a big boost for the national economy.
The Unity Government is not flawless, but it is vital to continue this exercise in political unity for the larger good of the nation. There are elements in the Opposition that are desperate to ruin the process of reconciliation to meet their own political ends. In this backdrop, unity must prevail between the two main parties. Politics must come second, the countrys future must come first.

Caspian five takes strategic step forward
In the seemingly complex and often contradictory mass of political developments throughout the world it is hardtop discern any logic or rationality. They are usually attributed chance and fate of nations. However, careful observation would reveal the inner dialectics of international relations and their shifts.
Politics is supposed to be a concentrated form of economics. Thus they are inter-related. It is in the sphere of fundamental economic relations that one has to look for any rational causes for political developments within nations and among nations.
The world has not yet recovered from the financial crisis of 2008 despite assertions to the contrary by apologetics of bourgeois economists. Pax Americana is on the wane and China is ascending fast as the future world leader. At present it has the second largest economy in the world next to the United States only. The day is not far off when it will overtake the US.
Production has shifted eastwards from the United States and Western Europe. Asia led by China, India and Japan has become the centre of gravity of industrial production. The BRICS nations also constitute an emerging power bloc. Resurgent Africa has entered the development path. Latin American nations are experimenting with new ways of overcoming dependence on their former colonial masters. In the Middle East Iran, Syria and Russia are reinforcing an alliance that would offset the influence held by the United States, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States together with Egypt and Israel. The Gulf Cooperation Council is rupture by sanctions imposed by several of its members against Qatar in an effort to change its independent foreign policy. It is being assisted by Iran and Turkey. The latter has become a dissident within the NATO and is openly taking hostile positions. It is getting closer to Russia and Iran  formidable rivals of the NATO. Meanwhile, shameful collaboration and patronage afforded to Israel by the United States is distancing it from the Arab nations.
Chinas emerging economy
Pakistan which was closely aligned with the US in the past has been abandoned by the latter. Military aid to Pakistan has been halted by the US. It was a few days ago that several accords were signed between Russia and Pakistan. Russia has agreed to train Pakistan military officials in Russia, a step that has infuriated the US. Russia and China have intensified their military and political cooperation.
The United States is not giving up its leading role and hegemony without a fight. Being the most armed world power in history with an immense arsenal of nuclear and conventional weapons it is threatening to use force to maintain its supremacy and counter the Chinese threat.
Its relations with nuclear powered Russia are at a very low web. A new arms race has been triggered between the US, Russia and China.
In order to contain China, the United States has shifted the focus of its strategic objectives from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. They want to dominate the Asia  Pacific region, especially its maritime zone. In this, it is trying to build an alliance with Japan, India and Australia among others. On the other hand, both India and China are members of the Shanghai Cooperation Council for maintaining peace in this region.
Caspian Sea littoral states
It is in the context of above regional and global political developments that one has to assess the outcome of the Convention of littoral states of the Caspian Sea held in the Kazakh city of Aktau last Sunday. The Caspian Sea is the largest enclosed water body on earth by area, variously classed as the worlds largest lake.
At the conclusion of the Summit the presidents of Iran, Russia, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and the Republic of Azerbaijan signed the convention on the Caspian legal regime. Also, senior officials from the participating states signed six other agreements: a protocol on cooperation in the fight against terrorism in the Caspian Sea, a protocol on cooperation in countering organised crimes, an agreement on economic interaction, a multilateral transportation agreement, an agreement on preventing incidents in the Caspian Sea, and a protocol on partnership among the border guards of the Caspian states.
Since the Caspian Sea is located near hotbeds of tension and areas of international terrorist activity, viz., the Middle East and Afghanistan Caspian countries attach great importance to the issues of security.
Hailing the Summit as a very important and landmark event President Putin said: the Convention confers upon the five states exclusive and sovereign rights to use the Caspian Sea, to pursue its responsible development and to use its assets and other resources. and ensures that armed forces of non-regional countries are not present in the Caspian region.

Chena cultivation to be promoted countrywide
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera pledged to take steps to promote chena cultivation once again in the country, considering a request made by District Secretaries.
This was discussed at a meeting regarding development plans of the agriculture sector, on Wednesday, at the Sri Lanka Institute of Development Administration (SLIDA), under the patronage of Agriculture Minister Amaraweera, with the participation of District Secretaries and Divisional Secretaries.
The District Secretaries stressed the importance of promoting chena cultivation, claiming that it is the best way to enhance the production of grain legumes and oil crops.
The chena cultivation is a traditional agricultural practice of farmers practiced extensively in the dry zone. However, the chena cultivation was discouraged claiming that it destroyed forest cover.
The District Secretaries said ancient Sri Lankans had ensured that the environment was unharmed in the process and farmers never burnt thick jungles for the purpose but they burnt only grass and bushes. The government has to spend a large amount of funds for the importation of grain legumes and other oil crops which can be easily cultivated in chenas.
The country had spent Rs. 689 million for the importation of ground nuts in 2017 and Rs. 750 million for the importation of cashew nuts. Rs. 27 million had been spent for the importation of sesame and Rs. 243 million spent for the importation of kurakkan. The country had also spent Rs. 6,627 million for the importation of maize. The entire mustard requirement of the country depends on imports.
Drought resistant crops such as grains, legumes, oil crops and vegetables could be grown in chenas. The chena cultivation is most suitable for Moneragala, Hambantota, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Mullaitivu and Kilinochchi districts.

DRUG FREE WESTERN PROVINCE IN THREE MONTHS
A pilot project is to be launched tomorrow within the Northern range of the Western Province which will mobilise all law enforcement agencies in a fully fledged crackdown on narcotics. The project aims to decrease narcotic usage by 40 percent within the next three months.
The project will be launched with the opening of three dedicated drug reporting Hotlines functioning directly under the purview of the Deputy Inspector General of Police Office in the Western Province Northern Range.
Around 75 percent of crimes committed within the Western Province are drug related offenses. While theres been many attempts in the past to rid the province of the drug menace, this project will galvanise public support for a comprehensive crackdown, DIG Deshabandu Tennakoon said. Through the intensification of crackdown, we wish to bring down narcotic usage by 40 percent and subsequently crimes by 20 percent within the next three months.
DIG Tennakoon emphasised the need to have public support saying that ordinary citizens are fearful of passing on information to the Police relating to drugs. This is an issue of credibility and confidentiality, he said. Through the drug reporting Hotline, we aim to revert to the initial informer with our findings or arrest which would a foster a better relationship and improve efficiency.
The project which envisions to clampdown on drugs from the grassroots level mostly concerns drug addicts for which plans are afoot to send nearly 500 of them for rehabilitation. Rehabilitation is an important facet of the fight against drugs since we will be working from the grassroots level upwards, he said. We will be meeting Magistrates next week on how we could streamline this process to ensure that they are swiftly sent to the centres.
As part of the first phase of this project, the progress is to be monitored by the University of Kelaniya after which based on its success rate, the project will be implemented to the greater Western Province and Islandwide thereafter.
The toll-free hotline has been initiated by Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel to serve 2.1 million residents in 1177 Grama Niladhari divisions within the Gampaha district.
The project draws support from rural based anti-narcotic committees inclusive of nearly 2000 members.
Speaking further DIG Tennakoon added that selective police officers will work directly under the purview of the DIGs office in supporting this project. The news measures are intended to increase the efficiency and enable a comprehensive crackdown on drugs.
Accordingly, the three hotlines are 0713690001 (Negombo), 0713210001 (Gampaha) and 0713580001 (Kelaniya).

Pitabeddara police in Matara found the electrocuted body of Kudage Piyasena (58), a farmer of Siyambalagoda, Pitabeddara, in a stream of the Nilwala river on August 14.
Police are looking for another paddy farmer who allegedly threw the dead body to the river.
The deceased had been electrocuted by a live wire that the former had set to the fence of his paddy field. The body was sent for a post mortem to the Matara Hospital. It reveals that Piyasena had died of electrocution.
At the inquest, it was decided that the death was a homicide.
Piyasenas wife had called him for tea around 6.15 am and came to know that he was not in the house. She then had complained to Pitabeddara police of her husbands disappearance.
She lodged another complain the following day that she was suspicious of her husbands death. He may have been electrocuted accidentally when he touched a live wire fixed to a fence around a paddy field by another farmer, she had told police.
Police found the body around 3 pm on the same day.

England recall Stokes for third Test against India
NOTTINGHAM Aug17: England have recalled Ben Stokes to their starting XI for the third Test against India at Trent Bridge just 72 hours after he was cleared in a trial for affray, captain Joe Root announced Friday.
All-rounder Stokes had been added to Englands 13-man squad on Tuesday after being acquitted at Bristol Crown Court in the trial that followed a fight outside a nightclub in the city in September.
Stokes replaces left-arm swing bowler Sam Curran, Englands man-of-the-match in their 31-run win in the first Test at Edgbaston earlier this month, with Root saying it was probably one of the most difficult decisions Ive had to make as captain.
Stokes missed Englands innings and 159-run win in the second Test at Lords last week because of a clash of dates with his trial after playing in the series opener.
Hes just desperate to get back playing cricket, make that his main focus moving forward, Root told reporters at Trent Bridge, where the third Test starts on Saturday.
He felt he was ready to play. We assessed his fitness as well and made that call, the top-order batsman explained ahead of a match where another England win would give them an unassailable 3-0 lead in a five-match series. In a separate interview with BBC radio, Root, a friend of Stokess since their days together in junior cricket, was asked if he felt his fellow 27-year-old was ready to return to the Test arena. We had two days to gauge that, in terms of fitness, making sure hes physically right to play, Root replied.
I sat him down last (Thursday) night, just me and him, and I asked him brutally and honestly if he was in the right place to play for England and he assured me that hes ready to perform at his best, he insisted.
From that perspective, I have no worries or doubts that he will go and deliver just like he has so many times. England coach Trevor Bayliss said Thursday that Stokes should make a public apology similar to the one he gave his team-mates in New Zealand in February following his return to the international scene after he was stripped of the vice-captaincy and left out of the 4-0 Ashes series loss in Australia.
But Root would not be drawn on the issue, saying it was a matter for Stokes.
And when asked if the Durham star had apologised again to the squad at Trent Bridge, Root answered: That is for us and within our dressing room.
There are certain things that should be kept within the group and I will leave it there. Curran was entitled to feel aggrieved after a four-wicket haul and an impressive fifty in what was just the 20-year-olds second Test match turned the tide in Englands favour at Edgbaston.
I think some people would see that as the easy option, to leave Sam out, Root said.
But hes offered so much to this bowling group -- and at the start of the series I said to the team for us to win a five-match series against the best side in the world, its going to take more than just 11 players.
India may call up Rishabh Pant in place of fellow wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik in a bid to bolster their batting, while paceman Umesh Yadav, unlucky to be dropped in favour of left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav at Lords, could return.
Above all India will hope that captain and star batsman Virat Kohli, who scored 200 runs at Edgbaston including a superb 149, is fit after being plagued by back trouble at Lords.
India coach Ravi Shastri was upbeat about Kohlis prospects on Thursday while urging a side with no negative bone to show some grit with the bat.

FIGHT AGAINST CRIME AND CONTEMPT OF THE LAW
The threat of more strikes in the transport sector and the uncertainty on Provincial Council elections brings focus to the political divisions within the government of unity. However, the arrest of Navy Sampath, wanted for some big crime brings relief to the government, with a message of progress in the fight against corruption and criminal acts of the past regime.
Colombo Fort Magistrates Courts order to initiate separate legal action against the suspect Chandana Prasad Hettiarachchi, a former Lieutenant Commander of the Navy, on matters beyond his arrest in connection with the abduction, torture, extortion and the alleged abduction of 11 persons, shows a wider range of crime. It is an extension of crooked practice in covering ones identity that point to support from hidden sources. The additional offences include preparing a false passport, a false National ID, and pretending to be another individual. He is also wanted for the former TNA Jaffna District MP Nadaraja Ravirajs murder, found not guilty by the Colombo High Court, but being appealed by the State.
The Magistrate also directed inquiry into the alleged transfer to him of Rs. 500,000 from the Sri Lanka Navy. This could show the wider involvement of high-ranking Navy personnel in the long absence of Navy Sampath, and alleged naval links to the abduction of 11 persons, mainly youth in 2008 and 2009, held in naval premises in Colombo and Trincomalee. The breakthrough with Navy Sampath should give encouragement to the FCID and other anti-crime forces that have come very far in the hunt for the killers of Lasantha Wickrematunge and Rugby Captain Wasim Thajudeen. This could be a major turn in the governments pledge to fight the crimes and corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime, threatened by lack of sufficient support from forces of government. Quick and clean police and legal action on the Navy Sampath related abduction of 11, could give those in government keen to proceed with a good fight against corruption, cause for new political strength.
Sangha and the Law
Moves by sections of the Maha Sangha to have an intervention in support of the leader of the Budu Bala Sena, Galagoda Atthe Gnanasara Thera, convicted by the Supreme Court for Contempt of Court, is no surprise. The Kotte Maha Sangha Sabha, to which Gnanasara Thera belongs, has observed a legal problem involving the monks conviction.
The Mahanayake Thera of the Sangha Sabha sees the actions of Gnanasara Thera that led to his conviction, being for the betterment of the country, the Maha Sangha and the Buddha Sasana. There was a mighty row just over a month ago, about this Thera having to wear the prison jumper, when convicted to imprisonment. The observing of a legal problem over this monks conviction is in keeping with the jumper trend, and nothing on how his conviction affects the country, the Maha Sabha and the Buddha Sasana.
The Kingdom of Kotte gave us some great monks who brought to the people the fine teachings of the Dhamma and Sinhala Literature, and a wonderful combination of both. The Loveda Sangrava alone can teach both monks and laymen the value of law and order in society. Their teaching did not seek any confrontation between the Law and the Buddhist Order. Members of the Sangha did fight for freedom from foreign and colonial rule, and bring a more equitable society in this country. The Buddhist clergy does not seek to violate or insult the Rule of Law, especially when the Supreme Court of the land interprets it.
The case record of Gnanasara Thera shows he did refer to the law of the foreigners or Suddhas. It is good for those worried about the Suddhas law to know that the bulk of our laws have come from the colonial rulers, and accepted in this post-colonial, independent country. Free Education itself was a law adopted during colonial days. The structure of the Nikayas was also bought to law in the days of the Suddhas.
The verdict of the Supreme Court is certainly based on such law. Roman-Dutch Law and a vast amount of our laws have come from western traditions of legality. The members of the Sangha, who are citizens of this country, are bound by the laws of the land, as are all other citizens. The Buddhist monks certainly have the right, just as other citizens, to seek amendments or changes to laws that are outdated, undemocratic, and unfair by the people. This does not mean contempt for the institutions that administer the law as it stands  The Courts of the Country. What Gnanasara Thera did was to bring the Court at Homagama, and the judge presiding in that Court to gross contempt. There is a law against such action, even when committed by one wearing a Yellow Robe of the Sangha.
It is necessary for all sections of the Sangha, including from the Kotte Sangha Sabha, to understand and appreciate this realty, which is in keeping with an understanding of the teachings of the Buddha, which seeks a civilized and humane society, and not a society of the vulgar and the unlawful.
The pohottu spread
The government certainly has to come to a quick decision on the Provincial Council elections. Three councils are not functioning, and very soon, the others will be dissolved.
The delay in the polls can only be a loss to the government, both the UNP and SLFP branches of it. Disagreement on the type of poll to be held is of little interest to voters, and there are many new voters being registered. The government must realize that the defeats suffered by the UNP, and worse by the SLFP, in the Local Government Polls was largely due to the delay in that election.
If the government is unable to come to a decision on the system of polling for the provincial elections, is it not possible for the proportional system to be used, with existing legislation Many analysts of election laws think this could be done, as law has still not been replaced, although the second reading of the new Act has been passed. In the absence of a new Act, they see the old Act remaining as law. Is this not a position the Commission of Elections should take or could take, and go ahead with the next polls The Government and the Elections Commission should move with speed on these polls.
While the government has this problem, the Joint Opposition is certainly having its own problems. Apart from the differences within the Rajapaksa family on the next candidate for the presidency, the increased differences within the SLFP remains a constant problem. The Speaker gave a very clear and firm ruling on the office of Leader of the Opposition. The UPFA/SLFP members of the JO must now decide whether they can really leave the UPFA. Are they prepared to face a possible expulsion from their seats in the event of resigning from the Alliance they contested the election This is a matter that will have to be decided by the Courts, but are they ready to take such a risk. The Chairman of the SLPP, Prof. Peiris, with all his knowledge of the law, may not be able to give a clear ruling on this issue.
The JO and SLPP are divided on the Rajapaksa brotherhood on the presidential candidacy. The voice from Kalutara is very clear on his opposition to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. There are questions whether Gotabhaya or Basil, and certainly not Chamal, will support the future expectations of Mahinda Rajapaksa for his son Namal.
The team of Blue 16 of the SLFP also shows further divisions, with four of them  SB Dissanayake, Dilan Perera, Dayasiri Jayasekera and Thilanga Sumathipala making a show of remaining with Maithripala Sirisena as the next Blue candidate.
The new political activity at Polonnaruwa by President Sirisena, with more tough talk on solving wider national issues, cannot give any satisfaction to any of the Rajapaksa brothers in the line-up for the candidacy. While the general expectation on the JO and SLPP or Pohottuwa is for success as in the Local Government election, there are doubts emerging whether the public will vote the same way for a government. They are also worried about the ability to win over sufficient votes from the minorities.
All of this makes the Pohottuwa look more like a bunch of small pohotttus, than a winning flower. There are also concerns about the ability of President Sirisena to call for a presidential poll at any time in 2019. An early 2019 poll will pose major problems for the US citizen Gotabhaya, even with full military backing, to show that he is only a Sri Lankan citizen. Will electoral politics in Sri Lanka be left to the Citizenship Laws of the USA, or will a candidate here need an anti-immigration move by Donald Trump to sign ones nomination form

The first-ever wicketkeepers hat-trick in first-class cricket
The term hat-trick is commonly used when a bowler claims three wickets on three consecutive deliveries and sometimes when a team picks three in three is referred to teams hat-trick though not usually included as a record. The lesser-known hat-trick in cricket is wicketkeepers hat-trick which is recorded when a keeper takes a catch or effects a stumping in three consecutive deliveries. The first such hat-trick was recorded more than 100 years after the origin of first-class cricket.
The format kicked off in 1777 but first hat-trick by a bowler was recorded in 1840. As the number of matches played in the format increased, the appearance of bowling hat-tricks also improved. A total of five hat-tricks were witnessed in the 1868 season in England. However, the 1893 County Championship witnessed a hat-trick that turned out to be a path-breaker in the history of first-class cricket.
Somerset toured Cheltenham to face Gloucestershire in the 3-day fixture part of the county championship. The visiting team were bundled out for 197 after electing to bat first as William Murch and Frederick Roberts took four wickets apiece. Later, a five-wicket haul by Edwin Tyler kept the home team down to 166 as Somerset took a 31-run first innings lead. Gloucestershire were cruising at 140/5 before Tyler took four of the last five wickets to fall.
Somerset increased the command on the game as they were 270/7 into the last over of the 2nd day with their lead already crossing 300. At the point, the home teams leg-spinner Charles Townsend ensured he closed Somersets 2nd innings on the same day. He got Arthur Newton stumped on the 3rd ball of the 74th over (5-ball overs) before he dismissed George Nicholas and Tyler in similar fashion on the next two deliveries.
Thus, Townsend completed a hat-trick to bowl Somerset out for 270 and his team was up to chase 302 on the final day. William Sam Brain, the Gloucestershire wicketkeeper, was the man who effected stumpings on three consecutive deliveries. Thus, Brian became the first keeper in the history of first-class cricket to take a catch or effect a stumping with three consecutive deliveries.
He is also till date the only wicketkeeper to effect stumpings on three deliveries straight in the history of first-class cricket.
Khershed Meherhomji in 1931, George Dawkes in 1958, Jack Russell in 1986 and Tony Frost in 2003 are some other known instances when the wicketkeepers recorded a hat-trick. Interestingly, all these four hat-tricks were completed with catches. There are a couple of instances where wicketkeepers rolled their arms to take hat-tricks in the first-class cricket. Bengals Probir Sen and in 1954/55 and Warwickshires Alan Smith in 1965 have taken hat-tricks while playing as keepers. - ct

Former Test opener Jamshed banned for ten years over spot-fixing
LAHORE, Friday - Pakistan cricket banned former Test opener Nasir Jamshed for ten years Friday on multiple charges of spot fixing, wrapping up a 16-month investigation into a wide-ranging scandal that rocked the Pakistan Super League.
Jamshed, 28, is the sixth player to be banned following the scandal that tainted the Twenty20 tournament in only its second year, and was described by cricket authorities as its lynchpin.
Todays decision against Jamshed wraps up the fixing saga and the tribunal has banned him for ten years on multiple charges, said Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) legal adviser Taffazul Rizvi in footage shared by the PCB on Twitter.
Spot-fixing refers to illegal activity in a sport where a specific part of a game is fixed, unlike match-fixing, where the whole result is fixed. Jamshed was first banned for 12 months in December last year after he was
found guilty of non-cooperation with the tribunal investigating allegations of spot-fixing.
This year, he faced five further charges related to fixing, all of which were proven said Rizvi, who said it was a matter of sadness that another player has spoiled his career.
Swashbuckling opener Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Nawaz, and Nasir Jamshed have also been given bans of varying lengths. Regarded as a talented left-hander, Jamshed played two Tests, 48 one-day and 18 Twenty20 internationals for Pakistan. He hit three consecutive one-day hundreds against India in 2012.

Imran Khan to be sworn-in as PM today
Former cricket star Imran Khan has been elected Prime Minister of Pakistan in a vote at the countrys National Assembly.
His PTI party won the most number of seats in Julys elections - setting up Khan to become PM with the help of small parties, more than two decades after he first entered politics. He will be sworn in today (Saturday).
Khan, 65, will inherit a country with a mounting economic crisis and he has vowed to create a new Pakistan.
The charismatic sports star, who captained Pakistan to a World Cup victory in 1992, has long shed his celebrity image and now styles himself as a pious, populist, anti-poverty reformer.
He ran on an anti-corruption platform that pledged to improve the lives of the countrys poor with an Islamic welfare state.
In Fridays vote, Khan was backed by 176 National Assembly members. His opponent, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif, received 96 votes.
Before the election Khan told the BBC that if he were to be elected, his initial focus would be on the economy. Pakistans currency, the rupee, has declined significantly in the last year. Inflation is on the rise and the trade deficit is widening. - BBC

Indian grandmother leads elderly charge for Asian Games bridge gold
NEW DELHI, Friday - Rita Choksi says yoga and breathing exercises have kept her sharp as the Indian grandmother goes for gold at the age of 79 -- just one of many elderly contenders in the Asian Games bridge competition.
Choksi may be Indias oldest athlete at the Games in Jakarta, but shes one of several 70-plus bridge players as the cerebral card game makes its debut at the regional Olympics.
Also in the mix are Malaysias Lee Hung Fong, at 81 the Games oldest competitor, and 78-year-old tobacco billionaire Michael Bambang Hartono, Indonesias richest man. Bridge is one of the more surprising sports among the 40 at the Games, which also include paragliding and jet-skiing -- alongside Olympic events like swimming and athletics.
At the other end of the generational scale, video games or eSports will make their debut as a demonstration event, before becoming a full medal sport at the next Games in 2022.
Choksi is one of four septuagenarians in Indias bridge team, which has an average age of 60. As well as her morning yoga routine, she spends three hours a day playing bridge online.
I am looking forward to it. As far as age is concerned, I never felt that old, that was my problem, said Choksi, who will turn 80 in October. They kept saying that there other people much younger but they feel old, she told AFP at her home in what, coincidentally, was once the athletes village for the 1982 Games in New Delhi.
Choksi took up the sport in the 1970s and has represented India at international tournaments in China, Pakistan and the United States. She secured her Asian Games place at a contest in Goa.
I played well in Goa and the president of the Bridge Federation of India felt I am good enough. They selected nine ladies out of the 24-member bridge team, Choksi said with pride.
Choksi is confident that bridge will contribute to Indias medal tally as the country has internationally ranked players. China and Indonesia are also strong.
Bridge is a different game, its a mind game and there is no age barrier in this, Anand Samant, secretary of the Bridge Federation of India, told AFP.
Rita is part of a mixed event and her male partner is also in his sixties. We had a fair selection process at various camps and the teams were selected after proper evaluation. Anand said every country faces some uncertainty as bridge is contested for the first time.
Choksi said that while some of her team-mates take prescribed pills to stay healthy, she remains fit through more natural means. I am more into Ayurveda (traditional Indian medicine) and by the grace of God I have no ailment. I do yoga in the morning and do breathing exercises, said Choksi. I go to bed very early and I wake up early and keep myself busy all through the day.

Italian politicians call bridge collapse manslaughter
ITALY: Rescuers continue their search for possible survivors and bodies of victims of Tuesdays highway bridge collapse in Italy. The death toll is at 38, but authorities say some people are still unaccounted for and no one is prepared to call off the search and rescue operation. Hundreds of people have been evacuated from their homes near parts of the bridge that remained standing.
The city of Genoas chief prosecutor has said there may still be 10 to 20 people missing and not all the recovered bodies have been identified. Sniffer dogs and large earth-movers are being used to search around large chunks of concrete in the debris of the collapsed bridge. Family members of those unaccounted for still hope a miracle may have kept their loved ones alive.
Meanwhile, hundreds of people have been evacuated from homes near parts of the bridge left standing and were told they may never be able to go back to their homes. Authorities said the homes might have to be torn down, along with the remaining bridge, which will then be rebuilt.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte met with Deputy Prime Ministers Matteo Salvini and Luigi di Maio, and the infrastructure minister, Danilo Toninelli, to take immediate measures following the disaster.
Conte declared a state of emergency for the northern port city of Genoa for 12-months and earmarked $5.6 million from national emergency funds for removal of the remaining parts of the bridge and re-developing the road system.
He also said Italians would observe a national day of mourning Saturday when state funerals will be held for the victims.
The prime minister also announced the government has begun the process of revoking the contract of the company managing Italys highway system. The firm, Autostrade per lItalia, said it carried out regular maintenance and safety checks on the bridge that gave reassuring results.
A criminal investigation has been launched to ascertain the cause of the collapse. Prosecutors are investigating negligence in maintenance and the bridges design.
Genoa chief prosecutor Francesco Cozzi said it is a disaster caused by human failure and those responsible will be liable for manslaughter.
Experts like Antonio Brencich, a professor of construction at Genoa University, had warned two years ago the bridge was in need of being replaced, but his message was not heeded. Since its completion in 1967, the number of vehicles and weight load on the bridge each day significantly increased.
Local residents had also long complained the bridge was unsafe.
Speaking on national television, this Genoa resident said it was an expected tragedy because every day she traveled on it she could feel it move.
She added that there was always some repair going on. Even in recent days, workmen were busy on the bridge.- VOA

Takes oaths as Pakistans 19th Prime Minister today:
The multi-faceted Imran Khan
Touted to be the next prime minister of Pakistan, who takes the oath to the coveted office on 18th of August (today), Imran Khan has yet again proved what legends are made of.
The legendary all-rounder is indeed one of the most iconic personalities of all times. From scoring runs to taking wickets, to building a cancer hospital in Pakistan to now donning the hat of an ace politician  Imran Khan has put all his critics to rest.
A leader on and off field, he has always been in the news. From his playboy image to now the future Prime Minister, Imran Khan truly knows how to lead in every area. Whether it was his reverse-swinging yorker or his devastating batting which only knew how to score runs; Imran has been the main architect of Pakistani cricket.
Here are some interesting facts about him.
BACKGROUND
Imran Khans full name is Ahmad Khan Niazi Imran. Born in Lahore on 5th October 1952, he has two birthdates. The other being November 25th, 1952. Reports suggest the latter was wrongly mentioned in his passport and official papers. He is the only son of Ikramullah Khan Niazi, a civil engineer and his wife Shaukat Khanum.
AN AUTHOR PAR EXCELLENCE
Apart from his credentials as an acclaimed cricketer and politician, he has also authored several books. That includes six non-fiction books including an autobiography.
Some names are as follows:
Imran: The autobiography of Imran Khan
Imran Khans cricket skills
Indus Journey: A Personal View of Pakistan
All Round View
Warrior Race: A Journey Through the Land of the Tribal Pathans
PHILANTHROPY
After his mothers death due to cancer, he founded the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and the Namal College.
CRICKETING LEGEND
Imran was Pakistans most successful cricket captain, leading his country to victory at the 1992 World Cup. He played for the Pakistani cricket team from 1971 to 1992, and served as its captain intermittently throughout 19821992. Though he stepped down, he was requested to come back by the president of Pakistan, Zia ul Haq, to lead the team once again. At the age of 39, Khan led his team to Pakistans first and only one day World Cup victory in 1992.
His last Test match was against Sri Lanka at Faisalabad in 1992.
ODI CHARISMA
He has scored 3709 runs from 175 ODI matches at an average of 33.41. He also grabbed 182 wickets from as many matches. He has 7 international centuries and 37 fifties to his credit.
HONOURS THAT NEVER CEASE TO FLOW
In 1983, Imran Khan was named the Wisden Cricketer of the Year.
He has also been honoured with Pakistans civil award, the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, in 1992 and was appointed the fifth Chancellor of the University of Bradford in 2005.
The year 2007 saw him receive the Humanitarian Award at the Asian Sports Awards in Kuala Lumpur and then the International Cricket Councils centennial year celebrations saw him as one of the fifty-five cricketers who were inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame.
Imran Khan has also been awarded one of Pakistans highest award, the Jinnah Award, for his exemplary work.
POLITICAL VISION
In April 1996, Khan founded the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Movement for Justice) political party and became its chairman. He was an elected parliamentarian from his native constituency Mianwali in the National Assembly from November 2002 to October 2007 and was again elected during the 11 May 2013, general elections.
CONTROVERSIES FAVOURITE CHILD
Imrans domestic life has been as eventful as his sporting or political one. In his younger days as a cricketer, he had women swooning over him across the world.
Much has been talked about in the autobiography of his second wife, Reham Khan, which created an uproar in the Pakistani social circles.
Imran Khan was married to Jemima Goldsmith, the daughter of a British billionaire, for nine years before they divorced. They have two sons together. His second marriage to journalist and television anchor Reham Khan in 2015 was mired with controversy and ended in 10 months. At present, he is married to his spiritual guide, Bushra Maneka.

Peaceful atmosphere for undergrads, tough action against ragging - Minister
The Higher Education Ministry will create a peaceful and free educational atmosphere for all university undergraduates and take stern action against students involved in ragging, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
"All Police stations have been instructed by IGP Pujith Jayasundera to take legal action against university students involved in ragging under the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence in Educational Institutions Act No. 20 of 1998," he said.
The Minister was addressing the media at the Cultural Affairs Ministry auditorium yesterday.
"With the powers vested with the Prohibition of Ragging and Other Forms of Violence Act, university students involved in ragging will be sentenceD to up to 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment.
"Due to ragging, 637 registered undergraduates for the 2016/2017 academic year, have left universities due to the fear of ragging and other forms of violence. The amount of 2015/2016 academic year is 1,350," the Minster added.
There are a large number of students leaving the universities due to ragging and there are also instances of suicide attempts, Minister Rajapakshe said.
The Minister added that the government spends an average sum of Rs.500,000 annually for a university student.
This amount is only the recurrent expenditure. With the capital expenditure, the figure would be around Rs.1.5 million, he added.
He said that the law is firm against those who engage in ragging in universities and even the bailing out of a ragging suspect does not come within the jurisdiction of a Magistrate. He added that if convicted, such a criminal would be sentenced to 10 years Rigorous Imprisonment.
Minister Rajapakshe further said that the Anti-Ragging Act which was not fully implemented right along will now be brought into full force to curtail ragging in universities.
The Minister accused the Peratugami political group is behind all forms of unruly activities in the universities. When the Peratugami force creates problems in the universities, the so called Peratugamis receive large sums of money in return.
When the Peratugamis take undergraduates on to the streets, they receive millions in cash in return, he said.
University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva said that several measures have already been taken to stop ragging at universities. Under these moves, an anti-ragging mobile application was introduced. Besides, a 24 hour hotline number was also introduced.
University Vice Chancellors and other relevant officials have already been instructed to take action against the students who go against the law.

Special training for Police officers with INTERPOL expertise
PEaCE conducted a three-day training programme for officers of the Bureau for the Prevention of Abuse of Children and Women from August 5 to 7 in Negombo.
The participating officers were selected from 42 police divisions, and were trained by experts from the Child Sexual Exploitation division of INTERPOL on Sexual Exploitation of Children Online.
As Sri Lankas arm of ECPAT, an international network committed to End Sexual Exploitation of Children, Protecting Environment and Children Everywhere (PEaCE) is an NGO that works to protect children from all forms of abuse and promote their rights. The training was carried out as a part of PEaCEs latest project to End Sexual Exploitation of Children Online funded by the UK Government.
The training was conducted by experts from INTERPOL, Cecilia Wallin and Marjolijn Vander Hart, who arrived in Sri Lanka on the invitation of Mohammed Mahuruf, the Executive Director of PEaCE, to conduct the training for police officers.
The programme was inaugurated on August 5 by Inspector General of Police (IGP), Pujith Jayasundara and Acting Ambassador of the Netherlands to Sri Lanka Eva van Woersem.
At the inauguration, the Inspector General of Police stated that this is a valuable opportunity for the Sri Lanka Police as the Sexual Exploitation of Children Online has become a grave crime all over the world, and it is important to obtain international support to prevent such crimes. The training focused on the methods of identification of victims and investigation techniques that could be used for crimes conducted on the internet using various web sites, applications and servers. The knowledge was provided to officers regarding the techniques and investigation methods used by many international police forces during investigation of crimes. Further, the officers were taught on how to gather information through a computer or a mobile phone when a crime had taken place via the internet.
The trainers explained that perpetrators have a tendency to publish incriminating evidence on the internet in the form of photographs, videos and forum chats about their sexual abuse and exploitation of children. They also share them, and often earn money by selling them to third parties.
Sometimes children are blackmailed through social media and threatened by the perpetrators to produce or to obtain sexual images and videos of children. Once any child sexual abuse material (CSAM), such as a photo or video, is released to the internet regardless of the application, its impossible to delete as it is saved in various servers around the world.
As the internet connects people globally speedily, this means thousands access and download the material within minutes of release. Therefore, the sharing of such material will cause trauma and ruin the childs life.
To investigate such crimes and to collect evidence, law enforcement officers will have to use specific techniques, tools and employ expert knowledge.
As such, this training served as the base to provide this knowledge, while serving to increase the sensitivity of officers towards survivors by showing them the suffering that the victims go through.
The programme also received the support of the Director of the Bureau for the Prevention of Abuse of Children and Women in the Police, Superintendent of Police Lanka Amarasekera and Deputy Director Bimshani Jasinghaarachchi, who were present during the programme.
It was notable that this was the first time that an NGO in Sri Lanka had organized such an international level training for the police, and the first time that the INTERPOL had visited Sri Lanka to provide such training. The participants also expressed delight in being able to attend the training as it was provided for the Bureaus police officers who directly interact with the survivors.
The training ended on August 7 after providing the police officers an opportunity to broaden their knowledge regarding the investigation techniques and victim identification on Online Child Sexual Exploitation crimes. All 52 attendees were also given certificates.

Sports Doping  Five Controversies that Stunned the Sporting World
The plethora of sports that people watch keeps them entertained. The thrills at times are so suspenseful that they send our blood rate soaring high.
Sports of different kinds produce legends and create legacies that are hard-earned, setting an example for the next generation to follow.
However, every sporting event has another side to it that leaves lasting blemishes not just on the sportsperson, but on its religious followers, too.
Doping in sports, otherwise referred to as use of performance enhancing drugs, has created numerous controversies.
Earlier in November 2014, worlds top badminton player Lee Chong Wei failing a dope test sent out a clear message  no sport is free of drugs.
In the light of this incident, we take a look at major doping controversies that left a lifelong scar on the sport in picture as well as its fans 
1. DIEGO MARADONA-(FOOTBALL)
Diego Maradona is renowned for being one of the best football players in the games history. His Hand of God incident during the 1986 FIFA World Cup is not the only story that generated controversy. At a later stage, in 1994, he was tested positive for ephedrine, a performance enhancer and a banned substance, at the same time. After the game against Nigeria, where he lasted full 90 minutes, Maradona was asked to provide a urine sample. Five days later, when the reports came, it was declared that the Argentine had failed the test.
2. SHANE WARNE-(CRICKET)
Cricket is another sport that has been marred with doping controversies. It was during the 2003 ICC Cricket World Cup when Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne was sent home from the tournament for failing a dope test. The drugs responsible for his fate were hydrochlorothiazide and amiloride. Following the scandal, Warne was suspended from all forms of cricket over the next year. The player, in turn, claimed himself as being a victim of anti-doping hysteria, suggesting that his mother had given him the pills.
3. MARION JONES-(SPRINTING)
Marion Jones of the United States is a track and field athlete, who won five medals at the Sydney Summer Olympics, including three gold medals. In late 2004, the International Olympic Committee carried out research concerning Jones on whether she used steroids. Considered the worlds greatest female athlete at the time, she strongly denied all allegations, but eventually admitted to using steroids for two years starting 1999. As a result, she was stripped of all the hard-earned titles.
4. ALEX RODRIGUEZ-(BASEBALL)
One of the most popular Major League Baseball players, Alex Rodriguez, was involved in a doping scandal in 2014. Apparently, the New York Yankees star admitted to the same, as a result of which he was banned from the 2014 MLB season. Getting an insight into the same led the anti-doping boss calling Rodriguezs substance use the most potent example ever.
5. LANCE ARMSTRONG-(CYCLING)
Lance Armstrong has been a role model to many youngsters around the world. Well, not anymore. The legendary cyclist admitting to using performance enhancing drugs is seen as one of the darkest moments in sports history.
Apparently, he had a very capable racket that assisted him in cheating any form of drug test resulting in him appearing free of drugs at all times. Nevertheless, after constant grilling by the officials and the media, he admitted to taking banned substances during an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

A steady ride over troubled waters!
Three years is not a long period in the history of a nation with a proud record of a 25 centuries old civilization. However, it is a fairly significant segment of Sri Lanka's post independent era of seven decades.
The last three year period of our country is best known for good governance, which is a widely used term for proper exercise of authority in managing the resources of a country committed to basic principles of democracy. The good governance is all about making sure that this exercise of power helps improve quality of life enjoyed by all citizens.
The good governance verdict of the people, given on January 8, 2015 and endorsed exactly three years on August 17, 2015 was considered at that time as the most important requirement of the nation as the then government was not providing the quality of life that you think you and your fellow citizens deserve.
The key components of good governance are accountability, effectiveness and fair and equitable justice. Any democratically elected government should be accountable to the people. All citizens should be able to keep track of whether governments followed through its promises made during elections, where the money is coming from, where it goes, who is responsible for carrying out the government functions and last but not the least, is this information available to public.
Another key aspect is to see, if the government delivering services such as education, and health care to citizens in accordance with the needs and if the collecting of revenues is conducted honestly, investing those resources wisely and managing public properties for the benefit of all.
The citizens expect from a government of good governance to be truthful and trustworthy.
The government should act in a way so that the people could trust the government, its institutions and the individuals who run them. They have to be fair, reliable, stable, accountable, free of corruption and build trust between citizens and the government.
Democracy restored
Restoration of democracy and strengthening of democratic institutions is the most important achievement of the government since 2015. With the establishment of Constitution Council and all the required Commissions, the Government has largely succeeded in restoring public confidence in state institutions including the judiciary and the police. This was concluded during the first 100 days of the government by enacting the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which was one of the key election pledges. It set Presidential term limits, pruned certain powers of the Executive Presidency and transferred them to Parliament and restored the independence of government institutions. The government delivered on its core promises.
Delivering the promise on accountability, the Right to Information Act was adopted to ensure transparency of the government.
The government has gone a long way in fulfilling the promise on national reconciliation. Release of large segment of military occupied land in the North and East and the establishment of Office of Missing Persons are two such major steps.
One of the allegations against the government in the first three years was that the development benefits were slow to reach the people. However, that accusation is not much heard now as the major development activities have started to produce results. The Grama Shakthi village empowerment movement unleashed by President Maithripala Sirisena has yielded much benefits to the people at grass-roots level. The Public-Private Sectors and the People (PPP) involvement at village level small cottage industries have brought much benefits to the people with buy-back arrangements with major private companies. Recently the Grama Shakthi project received a boost from the complimentary Gamperaliya programme initiated by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to develop villages.
The homeless in the North and East have vastly benefited from the 50,000 houses distributed in those two provinces. The government has also pledged to establish 2,500 Uda Gammana villages by 2020 to address the housing needs of the people and the results so far show it is well on course to achieve it.
Achievements
One of the significant milestones of long term development activity was the construction of the biggest reservoir of multipurpose Mahaweli Project at Moragahakanda - Kalu Ganga to irrigate parched dry lands in faraway Vanni in the Northern Province on one side and Rajarata, Wayamba, Central and Eastern Provinces on the other as well as to generate hydropower.
It is no easy task to sustain a unity government of two major political parties, who were at each others' throats for over six decades. Considering the non-cooperative political culture penetrated deeply into the activists of political parties, it is almost a miracle to function together for a period of over three years. President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe deserve the credit for bringing the two parties together and maintaining that unity despite differences of policies and principles.
There were serious differences on major economic policy planning and the two leaders managed to keep the rocking boat of Yahapalanaya steady in these troubled waters. The efforts as well as the magnanimity displaced by the two leaders regarding reestablishment of an economic policy making body last year is highly praiseworthy.
Overall, the three years of Yahapalanaya government was not a bed of roses. However it has succeeded in overcoming massive challenges and taking strides in stabilizing the economy and ushering in steady development that would bring beneficial returns to the people.
What is equally important is for President Sirisena and Premier Wickremesinghe to build on the firm foundation laid during the last three years to show solid results during the next two years before facing the people's mandate once again.

Thirty dilapidated carriages to be put into service
Sri Lanka Railways will refurbish 30 dilapidated carriages at the Dematagoda and Ratmalana yards and put them in to service, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva said.
Ten of the refurbished compartments will be deployed on the Kelani Velly railway line in the near future, the Minister said.
The Railway Department together with a private company Tantri Trailers has refurbished these carriages with all modern facilities imported in 1989 and 1992. Minister de Silva on an inspection tour of the Dematagoda Railway yard told reporters that 140 carriages imported from Romania and 60 carriages of S8 power sets imported in 1992 would be refurbished and deployed to the service again.
The Minister said that 26 compartments are currently being refurbished at the Dematagoda factory.
Under the Tender conditions, the private firm has to restore the interior, seats, floor and the toilets completely in the train carriage.
However, the compartment body or the under frame, break system have been be undertaken by the Ratmalana Workshop of Sri Lanka Railways. The Ratmalana workshop just has a capacity to refurbish five compartments per year. But, the private firm has agreed to complete the task within three years, Minister de Silva said. The project has already given the job opportunities for around 200 youth so far. To purchase a new carriage, the department has to spend around Rs.60 million and under the new refurbish contract it could be done at a cost of Rs.12 million which is a saving of Rs.48 million.
The Minister further said the existing single Kelani Valley railway line will be converted into a double line and install signaling and electrification systems.
We have also carried out the Socio-Economic Survey of the affected population and will thereafter develop a Resettlement Plan for the communities affected by the implementation of the KV Line Rehabilitation Project, he added.

UNHCR invites Sri Lanka to play an active role in Organization
Ambassador A.L.A. Azeez, the Permanent Representative of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in Geneva, met with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Filippo Grandi, at the UNHCR Headquarters on August 15, 2018.
Recalling the long-standing, productive partnership between Sri Lanka and the UNHCR, High Commissioner Grandi remarked that at a time when there were many challenges around the world, Sri Lanka stood out as a country which had achieved significant progress in the resettlement of returning refugees and IDPs as well as in addressing issues of statelessness. He invited Sri Lanka to be an important stakeholder in the policy making process of the UNHCR, expressing hope that Sri Lankas proactive role would contribute significantly to the work of the UNHCR drawing upon the countrys positive experiences and insights.
Ambassador Azeez expressed appreciation for UNHCRs engagement in Sri Lanka in the past, highlighting the different forms of assistance and cooperation such a rewarding partnership had entailed. It was recalled that the UNHCR had built on some of its experiences gained in Sri Lanka in further improving delivery of assistance in other situations elsewhere. Through its policy of constructive engagement and dialogue and advancing peace building and reconciliation, stressed Ambassador Azeez, the Government of Sri Lanka looked forward to furthering cooperation with the UNHCR, in the context of the Global compact on refugees.
He also took the opportunity to brief UNHCR officials on the recent initiatives taken by the GoSL to become a State party to the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention (Ottawa Treaty), following its ongoing successful mine action programme, as well as the Convention on Cluster Munitions (Oslo Treaty), as further expression of Sri Lankas commitment to sustainable peace and development.

When Ajit Wadekar spoke, everybody listened, recalls Vinod Kambli
MUMBAI: Vinod Kambli had gotten used to receiving three WhatsApp messages from Ajit Wadekar on a daily basis. Without exception, he says, each would have a comic element, even if at times they were mere good morning forwards.
Some would end up leading to nostalgia-driven phone calls, lasting over an hour, as the two recalled the fun times they had together back when Wadekar was India coach and played indulgent mentor-cum-father figure to Kambli and Sachin Tendulkar.
But then the messages stopped a few days ago. Wadekar had taken ill before eventually passing away on Wednesday.
The car ride to the Wadekar household on Thursday morning to pay their respects was filled with the fondest reminisces for Tendulkar and Kambli. One in particular, Kambli reveals, had the two schoolmates-turned-Indian teammates giggling for old times sake.
It, of course, was about how we used to have meals and drinks on his tab at the hotel, and make him pay for them, he says. And as he reveals, it wasnt just the two of them who would make the most of Wadekars generosity. He used to be surrounded by press reporters. And the Wadekar tab was offered to them too. And then he would come and tell us, Achha, the board has to give me extra allowance from now on, recalls Kambli, expertly mimicking the former India captains voice and distinct style of speaking.
In a way, it sums up the kind of relationship that the two talented Mumbai youngsters shared with the first captain to lead India to overseas series wins. Wadekar already had a legend status, in Mumbai circles anyway, by the time he took over as India coach towards the end of 1992.
Vinod, I and he would always be next to each other on flights. He had this great ability to become a 20-year-old in our company and we could never tell the age-gap really. He would even take us along if he was meeting a friend for a meal, says Tendulkar. The menu, more often than not, involved a lot of seafood.
Wadekars innate sense of humour played a huge role in him bringing Tendulkar and Kambli under his wings. But within the dressing room, Kambli reveals, Wadekar not only had a commanding presence but also a sense of great authority that even senior players, including Kapil Dev and Mohammad Azharuddin, adhered to.
We were allowed to call him Jitya, like everyone else. But when he spoke, everyone listened, and it was no surprise that so many memorable team and individual performances came during his reign. He would always get the seniors to do the talking during meetings, and we would get our chance too on and off, he says. Kambli would, of course, put his coachs authority to good use on one occasion by coaxing Wadekar to get all the players to show off their dance moves during a washed-out Test match in Kandy.
There used to be a lot of security in Sri Lanka those days and we couldnt leave the hotel. I went to him and said, Sir, were getting bored and hatched a plan with him to invite the entire team to the discotheque in the hotel and get them to show their moves. And everyone, including Kapil paaji, was made to show a few individual steps in the centre of the room. Who could say no to Wadekar after all, says Kambli.
On another occasion, Kambli would call each member of the team and in the coachs voice, ask them to show up for a meeting in Wadekars room late in the night. A shocked and half-asleep Wadekar would open his door to find the entire team there and insist he hadnt called a meeting. The Wadekar manner of speaking, even Sunil Gavaskar insists, was tough not to mimic, especially the way he would say, arre kay re at least once a day.
When it came to cricket though, Tendulkar adds, it was always serious business for Wadekar, including bringing in a curfew system. Tendulkar and Kambli would often indulge in various challenges during fielding drills with their coach. Kambli talks about the time Wadekar pulled him up after he was dismissed for 224 against England at the Wankhede Stadium, 12 short of Gavaskars then India record.
Gadhadya, record saathi ghelaas aani out zhaalas na (You went for the record and got out) he said and I responded saying, Arey, (Mike) Gatting took the catch. What can I do says Kambli. Wadekar though would then walk up to the youngster and say, Sarkaar, you have left Bradman behind, when Kambli averaged around 110 after his first few Tests.
The only other time he recalls Wadekar, who retired as executive director with State Bank of India, not seeing the funny side was whenever the flamboyant left-hander would jovially ask him for a bank loan. Arey kaay re, they have become strict these days, hed say.  NDTV
