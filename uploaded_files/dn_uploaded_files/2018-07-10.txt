Pavard true to his roots in France's far north despite rapid rise
JEUMONT, France, Sunday - It has been a remarkable rise -- two years after supporting France at Euro 2016 from a fan zone, Benjamin Pavard is preparing to represent his country in a World Cup semi-final.
Pavard has already lit up the tournament with his wonder strike against Argentina. But the 22-year-old has never forgotten his roots in the little town of Jeumont, on the border with Belgium in northern France.
Coincidentally Belgium now stand between Pavard and Les Bleus, and a place in the World Cup final.
To show that you can be born here, live and grow up in Jeumont and go on to succeed at the highest level of international football is a wonderful lesson for the children of Jeumont and it gives them hope for the future, says local mayor Benjamin Saint-Huille.
He has ensured that banners in support of their hero have been displayed around the little town of 10,000 inhabitants, an hour's drive south of Lille,
The 22-year-old right-back grew up in Jeumont, but he is not the first football star from the town -- Jean-Pierre Papin, the prolific former France and Marseille striker also hails from there. Pavard started playing aged six, and his talent was immediately obvious.
At that age he was already doing 50 keepy-ups, right foot, left foot, head. He could do everything, it was impressive, recalls Sullivan Skiba, who coached Pavard in his early days.
It did not take the Pavard long to be spotted by Lille, and he joined the academy of the region's leading club.
A reserved personality, he turned out in central defence and sometimes in midfield. Little by little, he began to assert himself.
When he had to work, he was very serious. But outside, he was a bit of a joker, and he would turn his 1980s music up full blast. He was a rule-breaker, Corentin Halucha, who was at the Lille academy at the same time as Pavard, tells AFP.
A GOLDEN KID
Then Pavard got lucky when first-team coach Rene Girard, impressed by his versatility, handed him his professional debut in 2015.

President includes Cooperatives in National Economic Council
The century old Sri Lankan cooperative sector received the biggest boost in its history whenthe President invited it to sit in the future sessions of the National Economic Council (NEC) on 7 July. Many new relief measures for cooperatives were also announcedchief among them was exempting cooperatives from income tax payments - so that the sector would be revived to play a key role in Sri Lankas economic reforms.
I too began my working life as an employee of a cooperative. Cooperatives are a peoples movement-its a common platform to put forward their issues-to collaboratively voice them. National Cooperative Commission (NCC) under Minister Rishad Bathiudeen should take the lead in this said President Maithripala Sirisena in Batticaloa addressing Sri Lankas celebration festivities of the 96th International Cooperative Day in Batticaloa, organised by the Minister of Industry and Commerce.
 I call NCC and Minister Bathiudeen to launch even more activities in future to develop this sector. I call the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and NCC to sit with me in NEC in future to develop this sector further. Todays event lays a stronger foundation for the future of our coops.
I am pleased to announce that with immediate effect all cooperative societies of Sri Lanka are exempted from income tax. This will result in good savings for them said Minister Bathiudeen.
All cooperative employees across the country will be given an additional monthly allowance of Rs 1000 from next month. All the cooperative employees will be entitled to a pension from now on. Cooperatives struggling with bank loans will be given a reimbursement and our Cabinet Paper to this effect has been approved. As a result we have already paid Rs 100 million of bank loans owed by coops, through treasury funds. Another Rs 390 million cooperative loans will be reimbursed by us in the future with the support of Treasury.
Provision of heavy vehicles to cooperatives at low rates will also be done now since the President has given his approval. All these new decisions have been arrived at to make this important movement a key driver in the economic growth and reform vision of the Unity government.
The theme for 2018 International Day of Cooperatives (IDC) is Sustainable consumption and production; creating an opportunity for cooperatives to show how they run successful businesses while respecting our natural environment and the resources it offers said IFFCOs Director Singh, and added: The global cooperative sector is already working to achieve SDGs and this year theme is a result of this. Sri Lankas cooperative sector completes 114th anniversary this year. With the commencement of a rural credit society in Menikhinna village, Kandy (Central Province), Sri Lankas cooperatives movement began in 1904 and today 40% of Lankan population (850,000) are members of a cooperative society. There are 14500 such societies today across the country-sporting a huge assets and savings base close to US $3 billion.

## Title: Prof. Sampath Amaratunge, VC University of Sri Jayewardenepura
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Tuesday, July 10, 2018 - 01:00
Prof. Sampath Amaratunge, VC University of Sri Jayewardenepura
Prof.Sampath Amaratunge at first glance looked more like a corporate CEO than a university don and he was kind enough to give me an hour of his precious time for this interview at his office at the premises of University of Sri Jayewardenepura. He was not only a past cricketer but a cricket enthusiast as well.
Prof. Amaratunge an old Anandian started playing cricket at under 12 level, coached by the late Lionel Mendis, that team was captained by Nimal Wettimuny (one of Wettimuny brothers). At under 14 level Prof. Amaratunge played under Arjuna Ranatunga. According to Prof. Amaratunge before embarking on a match, Lionel Mendis used to draw a chalk circle on the floor with the wickets in their appropriate places and then give SR tooth paste tube caps to be set as fielders for each batsman of the opposing team. Arjuna even at that age was smart enough to set various fielders even before Lionel Mendis instructed him to do so.
Prof. Amaratunge was indebted to Lionel Mendis for teaching him good management tactics even at a tender age.
Came the O Levels almost all them in his team failed to get through, Prof. Amaratunge was one of the few fortunate ones. Then came the A levels and he did well and Arjunas mother was his class teacher and she put a stop to his cricket saying that his talent was in his studies and encouraged him to pursue that path since she knew that the bright young lad was destined to go far in the academic sphere. His last match was against St Benedicts where he took 10 wickets, it should also be noted that Prof. Amaratunge was a tall and strong fast bowler who stood at 6 3.
In 1982 he got through his A levels and was selected to follow a degree at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The first thing that young Sampath did was to make a bee line to see the cricket ground. This he said was because cricket was in his blood. By the time he was in his third year he managed to form the inaugural cricket team at the University, those days they were not famous for sport. That team consisted of Huston Jilla (Royal College), Marzook (Zahira College), Dayaratne (Dharmasoka Ambalangoda) Shantha Rubasinghe (St Aloysius Galle), Ravi Wijegunawardena (from Horana) and Ravi Jurangapathy (from Wesley College) they all played first eleven cricket for their respective schools. At the same time he played for the under 25 team of Rio Sports Club Ambalangoda and he was the only undergraduate in that team and again bowled fast.
In the year 1986 the University of Sri Jayewardenepura became the inter-unit tournament champions beating Colombo and Moratuwa. The final was against Moratuwa and in that match Prof. Amaratunge took 5 wickets accounting for all those Sara players and they won the match. At the time the Vice Chancellor was Dr Karunasena Kodituwakku and he asked Sampath what they wanted and he said that the facilities for practicing at the university grounds was not adequate and wanted better facilities. Dr Kodituwakku was so helpful that the following day they were practicing at the NCC nets and at the adjacent net the Sri Lanka national team players were practicing. Arjuna was very young at the time, Duleep Mendis was playing and we did get the opportunity to bowl at them. His connections with Arjuna is strong as ever even to this day.
A unique feature of that fast bowling duo, was both were extremely tall Rubasinghe being 6 4 and Sampath 63 and the umpires were concerned because there outstretched arms went over the sight screen and most of the batsmen were baffled. He stressed the fact that his love for cricket still takes pride of place.
During his University career he was made the captain of the cricket team. The cricket team of the University of Sri Jayewardenepura became the best cricket team (1986/87) among all Universities of Sri Lanka under the leadership of Prof. Amaratunge. He was also nominated as the best player that year. Prof. Amaratunge was also a University Coloursman for three years.
He was later appointed as the president Sri Lanka University Sports Association (SLUSA) in 2008 and he continued in this post till 2009. During his time as the president of SLUSA , the Mini Olympics was organized in the premises of University of Sri Jayewardenepura inviting the Prime Minister, Minister of Sports, Minister of Higher Education and other distinguished invitees.
The Professor related to me that he was different from the other academics in that his heart was with the students and due to his genuine concern for them, together with his out of the box thinking he had no problems in executing them.
The perks given to the students who were involved in sports were as follows, tailor made meals, track kits, appropriate footwear, free vitamins, and transport during the sport seasons. All these were funded by the money allocated for such purposes by the University Grants Commission.
As a result of these Developments University of Sri Jayewardenepura was renowned for its outstanding achievements in sports. The University won the overall championship at the Inter-University Games for three consecutive years.
Furthermore Prof. Amaratunge introduced medical camps for over 350 students. By hiring outstanding coaching staff, advisors and trainers enabling talented students reach their respective peaks.
Prof. Amaratunge stated that he believed in properly harnessing the funds given for the development of the universities. He noted that it is their duty that the students of the University who are the most important stakeholders of the institution get the best that can be offered for their development; as it is them who will in turn develop the nation.
Having been unanimously selected as the Vice Chancellor for the second term, he continues to develop the University of Sri Jayewardenepura with the hope of contributing to the development of higher education in the country.
I felt nothing but admiration for Professor Sampath Amaratunge who was never afraid to spend lavishly on his deserving students whom he treated as human beings and not as morons. He touched their hearts and they reciprocated well. I went down the campus premises and could not find any posters out of place where as earlier Japura was known to be splattered with posters everywhere. He has that corporate quality together with the intellect ability which stands him apart from the rest us who are also academics.
In our hour of need be it governance or Sri Lanka Cricket we badly need vibrant , honest people with integrity like Professor Sampath Amaratunge.

Public and semi-government sector employees exceed 1.1 mn
The importance of the public sector is an indisputable social and economic reality throughout the world. The public sector usually comprises organisations that are owned and operated by the government and exist to provide services such as public education, healthcare, national defence, military, police, infrastructure (public roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications, etc.) for its citizens.
Recognising the importance of the public and semi-government sector employment statistics, the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) has conducted periodic censuses of public and semi-government sector employment. The first such census was taken in 1980. Subsequently, censuses were carried out in 1985, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002 and 2006 at intervals of four to five years. Since the devolution of power to Provincial Councils in 1987, employment censuses from 1990 onwards covered both the Central Government and Provincial Councils.
The latest round of the Census of Public and Semi-Government Sector Employment was conducted by the DCS between 9.30am and 11.30am on November 17, 2016, and it is the eighth in the series of such censuses. The findings presented here are based on data gathered through questionnaires personally completed by more than 1 million employees in these two sectors. This census did not cover the uniformed staff of the three forces: Army, Navy and Air Force.
The information collected at this census includes sector of employment, age and sex, marital status, nature of appointment, level of education, major occupation group, professional or vocational qualifications, language skills, district of the place of work, mode of travel to work, non-communicable diseases, level of ICT literacy, etc. of the employees. Key findings of this census are presented here.
Number and proportion of employees
The total number of employees in the public and semi-government sectors excluding uniformed staff of the three forces - Army, Navy and Air Force, as at November 17, 2016, was enumerated as 1,109,475. Of the total employees, 55.1 percent are males and 44.9 percent are females. In any employment census, it is usual to determine the employees as a percentage of the total population and as a percentage of employees of all sectors (including all other sectors). The total number of employees is estimated quarterly as well as annually through the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey conducted by the DCS.
Public and semi-government sector employees constitute five percent of the population in the country. The proportion is the same across the provinces, with the exception of the North Central and Uva Provinces, where it is six percent, and the Western Province, where it is four percent.
As a proportion of all employees, that is in all sectors, public and semi-government employees are 14 percent. This proportion is highest (18 percent) in the Eastern Province and lowest (11 percent) in North Western and Sabaragamuwa Provinces.
Nature of appointment
The nature of the appointment of employees was considered under Permanent and pensionable, Permanent, pensionable and contributing to a provident fund, Permanent and contributing to a provident Fund, Temporary, Substitute, On contract basis, and Other categories. Ninety-five percent of public and semi-government sector employees are in permanent positions. Further, 79.4 percent of all employees are entitled to a pension after retirement. More female employees were in permanent and pensionable employment (83.7%) relative to their male counterparts (69%).
Sex composition
Males constitute a higher proportion of public and semi-government employees: Of the total public and semi-government employees 55.1 percent are males; among Central Government employees, almost two thirds are male. The higher proportion of employees are males in institutions such as the Department of Civil Security, Sri Lanka Police, Sri Lanka Electricity Board, Department of Posts, Sri Lanka Railway and Sri Lanka Transport Board, and the Road Development Authority. Contrary to this, almost 62 percent of employees in the Provincial Councils are female. This is mainly due to female teachers working in provincial schools.
Age structure
While the majority (61 percent of employees) are in the age group of 30-49 years, about one in four employees is over 50 years of age. Of those employees entitled for pensions, 60,092 are to retire on completion of 60 years, within the five-year period from 2018 to 2022. The number of persons to be retired in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 is 10,550, 11,300, 12,220, 12,560 and 13,460 respectively.
Level of education
In order to assess the level of education of public and semi-government sector employees, the highest level of education was categorised into Below GCE(O/L), Passed GCE(O/L), Passed GCE(A/L), Degree, Post Graduate Diploma, Post Graduate Degree, and PhD.
Over one third (35 percent) of public and semi-government employees are GCE (A/L) qualified and little over one fourth (26.1 percent) have degrees or higher qualifications. It is noteworthy that 190,498 employees or 17 percent employees have not passed the GCE (O/L) examination. Among males, this percentage is as high as 27.2 percent, while among females it is only 4.8 percent. Further, having a degree or higher level qualification among females is very high (36.7 percent) compared to males (17.6 percent). There are 290,378 graduates employed in public and semi-government sectors. Of them, 2,014 are reported to have more than one basic degree. More than half of graduates (54 percent) have degrees in the arts stream while management or commerce graduates are 14.3 percent, and science graduates only 10.4 percent.
District of workplace
Public and semi-government employees are concentrated in the Colombo district. A total of 225,000 or one out of five are working in the Colombo district. This is followed by Gampaha and Kandy districts - percentage of each district is 7.3 percent. The percentage in Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu and Mannar districts is less than one percent. When Divisional Secretariat Divisions are considered, the highest number of employees is working in the Colombo DS division of the Colombo District and it is where 67,000 employees are working. It is followed by the Thimbirigasyaya DS division (63,000 employees). Thus, more than half of the employees of the Colombo district are posted within the Colombo and Thimbirigasyaya DS divisions.
Six hundred employees are stationed in other countries in diplomatic missions, banks and other institutions.
Mode of travel
Employees were asked how they travel to and from work: Walking, Bus, Train, Assigned Official Vehicle, Official Group Transport, Private Motor Vehicle, Staff Service, Taxi, Motorcycle, Foot Bicycle, Other. The majority of employees (42 percent) use public transport to travel to work and it is noteworthy that almost one in four or over 277,000 employees use motorcycle to travel to work.
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs)
Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are a growing issue. The workplace is recognised internationally as crucial to address these health issues. Employees in any institution represent an important population category: their quality of life, health awareness, and ability to embrace healthy behaviours are expected to influence their productivity, avoid NCD occurrence, and reduce healthcare costs.
All employees were asked about the non-communicable diseases they are suffering from. Some commonly found NCDs were given and the respondents were allowed to mark more than one disease, if they are suffering from more than one NCD.
The most common self-declared NCD is diabetes. Almost six percent of employees suffer from diabetes - more males (7 percent) than females (4.5 percent). The second most common NCD is (5.3 percent) was high blood pressure.
Language proficiency
While Sinhala and Tamil languages are considered as official languages, English language is considered as the link language in the country. All employees were asked the level of their proficiency in Reading and Writing and Speaking of each language as Good, Average and None.
Just over 84.2 percent report good proficiency in reading and writing in the Sinhala language and 16.5 percent in the Tamil language. These percentages on the speaking proficiency are 85.1 percent and 16.6 percent respectively.
In general, communication skills in English have been identified as an important workplace tool for success in business and have been correlated with career success and increase in financial rewards. The self-declared proficiency in Reading and Writing and Speaking in the link language (English) of the public and semi-government sector employees are 23.7 percent and 15.1 percent respectively.
Ability to use computers, email and internet
Technology is an integral part of the 21st-century workplace that any business without some level of technical savvy is likely to fail. It is that critical. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can be used to eliminate non-value-adding tasks or to make them more efficient. ICT can also improve employee welfare, for example, through transforming the content of work by deleting unimportant activities. In this census, information on self-declared ability to use computers, e-mail and internet was collected from all employees.
More than 60 percent of public and semi-government employees report the ability to use a computer. Nonetheless, only 36 percent use computers to perform their official duties. Provincial sector employees are slightly more computer literate (ability to use a computer) with a computer literacy rate of 66 percent compared to that of the central government (61 percent).
According to the data from the census, 56.3 percent of employees are using the internet. Significant gender differences are observed in the use of the internet. More than 63 percent of female employees use the internet, while only 50.7 percent of male employees stated that they can use the internet.
Of all public and semi government sector employees, 38.4 percent said that they can use e-mail. Among males it is 34.7 percent, while among females it is 43.0 percent.
Conclusion
In todays economic environment, achieving improved performance and efficiency in public sector organisations is more important than ever to improve competitiveness, deliver better service, and reduce costs.
According to the literature, attempts to improve performance of the public sector have had mixed results in many countries. A precondition for new improvement programmes to succeed where earlier efforts have failed is that they should focus on improving precisely those factors that make a public service organisation perform well. These success factors have been identified as high quality of management, high quality of workforce, long-term commitment, open and action-oriented culture, and a culture of continuous improvement and renewal.
The report titled Census of Public and Semi-Government Sector Employment  2016 released by the DCS, presents a wealth of information on the employees of these two sectors. A few basic but important features of the employees is the high female participation that has resulted in near equality in numbers, still youthful but a large elderly age structure, relatively low levels of education, still to be achieved standards of information and communication technology.
Each of these has major implications such as the need for gender responsiveness, using strategies to maintain dynamism while optimising experience and expertise, and facilitating options for knowledge and skill enhancement of the employees. Recognising and responding to these implications will help to make the employees a satisfied workforce, predicting and preparing for future trends, as well as enabling the employees to deliver their services up to high standards. Information provided in this publication merits further analysis to produce policy and pragmatic guidance.
It can be used to make informed decisions, to further improve the performance of the public sector workforce to more effectively and efficiently provide public services to the citizens of this nation.

Since the end of the war in May 2009, civilian lands belonging to the people of the North that were taken away from them has been released to them gradually, although for many the process is taking too long. Currently, nine years after the end of the war, keeping in line with the governments policy of releasing civilians land, hitherto used by Jaffna Security Forces, the Sri Lanka Army released a record 683 acres of land in the Thelippalei Divisional Secretariat area to 964 legal owners during a ceremony, held in April under the auspices of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake and the District Secretary for Jaffna, NagalingamVedanayaham.

The Sri Lanka Navy currently occupies 636 acres while the Sri Lanka Air Force occupies 996.74 acres. The total area utilised by the security forces is 4627.11 acres.
The lands currently being held include the Palaly airfield of the Sri Lanka Air Force of 996.74 sq km. Against the total availability of land in the Northern Peninsula, the security forces occupy around 1.43% of it.
The release of lands was facilitated by the Security Force Headquarters Jaffna (SFHQ-J) under the guidance of Security Force Headquarters - Jaffna Commander Major General Darshana Hettiarachchi and a significant portion of land was released to the people in April this year as a New Year bonanza on the eve of the Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The gesture organised jointly by Ministry of National Integration and Reconciliation, Ministry of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, District Secretariat for Jaffna and the SFHQ-J, was attended by a large gathering of people, including the beneficiaries.
The military had come to an understanding to meet the needs of the people who had lost their lands in the North. Meanwhile, the military has also asked the Rehabilitation Ministry for Rs. 880 million to relocate its military installations in the north and east.
Further, the government also had taken measures to identify lands that belong to people who are overseas and it is said that most of them cannot be located. The authorities are trying to locate these owners and take over their lands legally on rent or lease to be utilised for development.
New beginning
Some of the landowners in the North who fled the country during the war have now returned only to find their lands being occupied by other parties who lay claim to these lands. Speaking to the Daily News a Jaffna resident who preferred to be referred to as Ravi said that his family had a land of around five acres in Jaffna, but when he had returned in 2010, he found that this land was being occupied by another party who had claimed this land as theirs.
Having contacted these occupants he had even offered to pay them a substantial sum as compensation. However, not being able to resolve the matter amicably, he had to seek justice through courts and the case has been dragging on since 2011 for which he has had to pay a substantial amount of money. He now wonders if the whole exercise is worth it, as he definitely has no intention of settling down in Jaffna again.
The TNA has been agitating for a long time about the releasing of lands to the civilians which are being held by the military and the Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake is of the view that the lands should be released to the people without further delay and they too deserve to return to their lands and commence their lives, which is still in limbo nine years since the war had ended.
The Jaffna Security Force Headquarters Commander Maj. Gen. Dharshana Hettiarachchi said while the rest of the country has resumed their lives and have left the pain of war far behind, being nine years since it ended, some are still suffering in IDP camps, which is definitely not fair. Some of these innocent people have been living in IDP camps for over 28 years and they too have a right to return to their lands and rebuild their lives and live a normal life. It is not fair to allow them to suffer any further while the majority of the country has long forgotten the effects of the war.

Runaway bride cherished dream of foreign job
A bride who arrived at the Ratnapura Marriage Registrars office to get registered in marriage had second thoughts at the last minute and quietly left the premises in a taxi, unbeknown to her family and relatives, minutes before the ceremony.
She had been engaged to marry a man proposed by her aunt and had arrived at the Registrars office with her family and relatives for the registration of the marriage.
The bride had been working for long in a garment factory worker and cherished hopes of going abroad to work. When her aunt brought the marriage proposal, she had told her parents and relatives that she would like to marry the boy after returning from a stint abroad.
The prospective groom agreed to her going abroad after the registration of their marriage.
Both parties had arrived at the Registrars Office for the marriage ceremony. Relatives who attended the ceremony were waiting in the compound until the auspicious time for the ceremony.
At the auspicious time, they were bewildered to find the bride missing. Meanwhile, the bride had spoken to her aunt over the mobile phone and said she went away thinking that her dream of working abroad would be shattered if she got married.
A dispute which would have occurred between the brides party and the bridegrooms party over the unexpected cancellation of the marriage was settled with the intervention of the lady registrar.

Sagans special day taking stage and yellow in front of family
La Roche-sur-Yon, Sunday: World champion Peter Sagan said he had three reasons to be cheerful as he won stage two and took the overall leader's yellow jersey in front of family and friends from Slovakia on the Tour de France on Sunday.
Sagan edged Sonny Colbrelli in a reduced sprint finish at La Roche-sur-Yon after a late crash in the peloton.
Overnight leader Fernando Gaviria came down in a mass high speed crash just 1.3km from the line, which Sagan and around 15 other riders avoided to set up a frantic finish.
Sagan leads Gaviria by six seconds in the overall standings, with champion Chris Froome trailing by 1min7sec.
Froome avoided a repeat of his first stage tumble, the Team Sky leader staying out of trouble as he goes in pursuit of a record-equalling fifth Tour triumph.
The Kenyan-born Briton said he was in good shape despite his recent woes.
""I'm feeling good. It's obviously never much fun crashing," he said in a lighthearted moment on the team bus.
"The legs feel good and I'm optimistic about what is to come hopefully," said Froome.
Another Briton Adam Yates was delayed by a fall and two of his Mitchelton Scott teammates were both also involved in separate falls. Sagan, riding for Bora-Hansgrohe, edged a field of nine lined up for the final reckoning but had to deal with French specialist Arnaud Demare and the Italian Colbrelli, who came within a hair's breadth of the win with a daring last second wheel push to come second. Sagan said: "It was something special with my father here and friends from my hometown.
"It was also our last realistic chance to get the yellow jersey with the team time-trial tomorrow."
"It's a great start for the fans," he added.
"Fernando won yesterday and now I'm the one with the yellow jersey, it's been exciting."
In the mix
"I could see it was going to be a good year," said Sagan, who was thrown off the Tour last year after being judged culpable of a fall that ended fellow sprinter Mark Cavendish's Tour.
"This makes up for last year," he said, adding he hadn't seen today's crash.
"My team got me into the mix," he said.
"Then Arnaud Demare went for it first and I just tried to stay on his wheel."
"It was a mess over those last five kilometres all up and down and then going up the hill there was a headwind," he said.
The Slovak led the pack in the intermediate sprint behind solo escapee French veteran Sylvain Chavanel, and is now also top of the green jersey standings.
Alongside Froome and Tom Dumoulin Sagan is perhaps cycling's top star, and has won the green jersey five times.
Overnight leader Colombia's Gaviria, who is just 23, said he was happy to be in the white best young riders jersey, although he too will be in pursuit of the green sprint points tunic too.
"We're happy, we had the yellow and that's part of history. Tomorrow's another day," he said, with his Quick Step team amongst the favourites to win in Monday. Germany's Andre Greipel was fourth but never really involved in the struggle for first with the other three.
The stage began in sizzling heat with local hero Sylvain Chavanel of the Direct Energie team based in this Vendee Western France region being cheered all along the 155km of a solo break.
Luis Leon Sanchez of Astana pulled out of the race after falling on a traffic island and getting up covered in cuts and climbing crying into the team car. Tsgabu Grmay of Ethiopia also retired.
Monday's third stage is a 35.5km team time-trial where the agenda for a tricky first week should be set with some significant time gaps expected on a slightly rolling course around Cholet in the same region as the first two stages.  AFP

SC grants leave for women rights activists FR petition
The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights (FR) petition filed by several womens activists and womens organisations that sought an Interim Order to suspend a Gazette Notification which prevents a female from lawfully being employed at a place of production and sale of liquor.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Vijith Malalgoda fixed the petition for argument on February 6 next year. The leave to proceed was granted in terms of Article 12(1)(2) and 14(1)(g) of the Constitution.
This petition had been filed by Women & Media Collective, Centre for Womens Research (CENWOR), Professor Camena Guneratne and 14 others naming Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera, the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, members of the Cabinet of Ministers and several others as respondents.
The petitioners had also sought to declare that the Ministry of Finance or the State are not entitled in Law to revoke the Excise Notification in a manner which prevents a female from lawfully being employed at a place of production and sale of liquor.
The Petitioners state that the subject matter of this application, relates inter alia to a matter which renders most poignant, the issue of equal protection of the rights of women in Sri Lanka, and more particularly, the equal rights of women to be engaged in an employment of their choice and to purchase or use according to their choice, any lawful article or goods available to Sri Lankan citizens as consumers.
The petitioners stated that recent Notification No.04/2018 issued by the Minister of Finance, and published in the Government Gazette Extraordinary No. 2054-42, dated 18.01.2018, pursuant to a Cabinet decision of 16.01.2018, restricting the rights of women; (a) to be engaged in and employed in the manufacture, collection, bottling, sale and transportation of liquor, and (b) to be sold or given Liquor within the premises of a tavern amounts to ex-facie and de jure gender based discrimination, infringing and violating the rights of adult women to the Right to Equality before the Law and the Equal Protection of the law, as guaranteed to all persons, by and under Articles 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution.
The petitioners are of the view that it is also severely offensive to the core values of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on the equal rights of women and men, as recognized in the recent judgment of Supreme Court in the case of Manohari Pelaketiya vs. H.M. Gunasekere, Secretary Ministry of Education et al (SC/FR 76/2012), where former Chief Justice Sripavan observed that; Sri Lanka has undertaken international obligations to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women by acceding to the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) on 17.07.1998 and in pursuance of these international obligations, Sri Lanka has also enacted several (laws) to give vent to these global rights in favour of women.
Presidents Counsel Sanjeeva Jayawardana with Counsel Dilumi De Alwis instructed by Paul Ratnayake Associates appeared for the Petitioners. Deputy Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena appeared for the Attorney General.

Sharma hits 100 as India edge England in T20 finale
BRISTOL, Sunday : Rohit Sharma backed up the heroics of pace bowler Hardik Pandya by hitting 100 not out as India clinched the T20 international series at Bristol.
Sharma became only the second Indian to pass 2,000 runs in this format as India chased down their target of 199 with eight balls and seven wickets to spare.
England batted first and threatened to post a huge score before stuttering at the end and finishing on 198-9 after their 20 overs.
Pandya took 4-38, his best figures in T20 cricket and wicketkeeper MS Dhoni became the first player to take five catches in international T20 and ran out Chris Jordan on the last ball of Englands innings for good measure.
Then Pandya was promoted up the order to produce a quickfire 33 not out that got India home in front of a crowd that was mostly fans supporting the away team.
Sharma praised Pandyas calmness, saying: He has done that a few years now. He is used to it now and he is doing it perfectly. The way he bowled gave him confidence to bat.
The 30-year-old Sharma produced his best batting of the series and put on 89 with his captain Kholi, the other Indian with 2,000 T20 runs, for the third wicket as India might the task look easy.
Sharma also became the second man, after Colin Munro of New Zealand, to score three international T20 centuries.
Virat Kholi made 43 as the pair took advantage of some short boundaries at the County Ground to pepper the stands with sixes until Kholi fired a return catch to Jordan.
Earlier Jordan had taken a stunning running and diving catch to dismiss KL Rahul in the deep to add to a stunning effort from Jake Ball at backward square leg that removed Shikhar Darwan.
After England squared the series in Cardiff last Friday India needed to win to make it seven successive international T20 series win in succession.
England captain Eoin Morgan said: On a small ground on a good wicket we would expect to score more than 198. This series for us has produced three different performances.
England had threatened to run away with the game and post a massive total until Pandya and Dhoni intervened and kept the chase total, on a small ground, realistic.
The hosts got off to a flier thanks to Joss Buttler and Jason Roy.
Deepak Chahars first over in international T20 cricket, and the first of the innings, cost 13 runs with Buttler accounting for 12 of them and within four overs England were 43-0.
Roy hit 67 from 31 balls, including seven sixes which equalled the most by an England batsman in T20.
England looked set for score of over 240 before Pandya applied the brakes.
He dismissed Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan, the returning Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow all after conceding 22 off his first over.
But with a total in excess of 240 looking likely the England middle order imploded to a combination of Pandya and the gloves of Dhoni.

Sixty injured in private bus collision
Sixty people were injured and hospitalized following a head-on collision between two private buses on the Dambulla-Kurunegala main road in Panliyadda, Melsiripura yesterday afternoon.
Among those injured were the drivers of the two buses, a Buddhist monk and a Bikkhuni. About 20 people who sustained serious injuries in the accident were admitted to the Galewala, Kurunegala, Gokarella and Dambulla hospitals.
Investigations have revealed that both buses belonged to the same owner.
One of the buses involved in the crash had been plying from Embilipitiya to Jaffna and other bus was travelling from Vavuniya to Embilipitiya.
Police suspect that the two buses had been travelling at high speed and the accident would have occurred while trying to overtake another vehicle. However, the passengers said that both drivers who were friends had been speeding and tried to overtake each other in an apparent race when the mishap occurred.
Some of the passengers said that the two drivers were in the habit of flashing their lights at each other often when they cross each other on the road.
Area residents said that they had heard a huge sound and had rushed to find that the two buses had collided.
Residents helped dispatch the injured to hospitals in the area.
Many of the injured passengers who were rushed to the Galewela hospital were later transferred to the Dambulla hospital and patients who were initially admitted to the Gokarella hospital were transferred to the Kurunegala hospital.
Vehicular traffic was disrupted for about 45 minutes on the Dambulla-Kurunegala main road and the Gokarella and Galewela took measures to bring the situation to normality.
According to an officer of the Gokarella Police Traffic Division, the reason for the accident is believed to be negligence while the two drivers were having fun teasing and challenging each other.
Several seats in both buses had been dislodged and were thrown towards the front of the bus injuring some passengers in the process. Gokarella Police is conducting further investigations.

The English Patient, which follows the lives of four characters brought together during World War II, told through the morphine-affected memories of a severely burned patient, was the Booker Prize winner in 1992. The English Patient was selected by the novelist Kamila Shamsie to represent the 1990s.
Shamsie said in a statement, The English Patient is that rare novel which gets under your skin and insists you return to it time and again, always yielding a new surprise or delight.
The 51 previous winners of the Man Booker Prize were considered by a panel of five specially appointed judges, each of whom was asked to read the winning novels from one decade of the prizes history, before the books faced a month-long public vote on the Man Booker website.
Englands Man Booker Prize committee has made it a custom to choose the best of its winners  perhaps lest they recede into a distant memory. The 25th, 40th and now the 50th anniversary is an offshoot of that custom.
The English Patient by Michael Ondaatje (Bloomsbury Publishing) has been announced as the winner of the Golden Man Booker Prize at the closing event of the Man Booker 50th Anniversary Festival at Southbank Centre.
The chosen work of fiction is deemed universal that withstands five decades. The single best work of fiction published since the awards inception in 1969  thats no simple deal.
The English Patient is a compelling work of fiction  both poetic and philosophical, Baroness Helena Kennedy, chair of the Booker Prize Foundation, said in a statement. As we celebrate the prizes 50th anniversary, its a testament to the impact and legacy of the Man Booker Prize that all of the winning books are still in print.
In a review in The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote: Reading The English Patient, you hold on to the gunnel and your hat at the start. But by the end you find yourself resting on the bottom of the boat, with your hat over your face to keep off Mr. Ondaatjes too brilliant prose.
The film adaptation of The English Patient starring Kristin Scott Thomas and Ralph Fiennes won nine Academy Awards in 1997, including best picture.

****
The English Patient is that rare novel which gets under your skin and insists you return to it time and again, always yielding a new surprise or delight. Its intricately (and rewardingly) structured, beautifully written, with great humanity written into every page. Ondaatjes imagination acknowledges no borders as it moves between Cairo, Italy, India, England, Canada  and between deserts and villas and bomb craters. And through all this, he makes you fall in love with his characters, live their joys and their sorrows. Few novels really deserve the praise: transformative. This one does.
- Kamila Shamsie, judge of the 1990s

The English Patient opens in an abandoned Italian villa at the end of the Second World War where Hana, a nurse, tends to her sole remaining patient. Rescued from a burning plane, the anonymous Englishman is damaged beyond recognition and haunted by painful memories. The only clue Hana has to unlocking his past is the one thing he clung on to through the fire  a copy of The Histories by Herodotus, covered with hand-written notes detailing a tragic love affair.

Excerpt from The English Patient
She stands up in the garden where she has been working and looks into the distance. She has sensed a shift in the weather. There is another gust of wind, a buckle of noise in the air, and the tall cypresses sway. She turns and moves uphill toward the house, climbing over a low wall, feeling the first drops of rain on her bare arms. She crosses the loggia and quickly enters the house.
In the kitchen she doesnt pause but goes through it and climbs the stairs which are in darkness and then continues along the long hall, at the end of which is a wedge of light from an open door.
She turns into the room which is another garden--this one made up of trees and bowers painted over its walls and ceiling. The man lies on the bed, his body exposed to the breeze, and he turns his head slowly towards her as she enters.
Every four days she washes his black body, beginning at the destroyed feet. She wets a washcloth and holding it above his ankles squeezes the water onto him, looking up as he murmurs, seeing his smile. Above the shins the burns are worst. Beyond purple. Bone.
She has nursed him for months and she knows the body well, the penis sleeping like a sea horse, the thin tight hips. Hipbones of Christ, she thinks. He is her despairing saint. He lies flat on his back, no pillow, looking up at the foliage painted onto the ceiling, its canopy of branches, and above that, blue sky.
She pours calamine in stripes across his chest where he is less burned, where she can touch him. She loves the hollow below the lowest rib, its cliff of skin. Reaching his shoulders she blows cool air onto his neck, and he mutters.
What she asks, coming out of her concentration. He turns his dark face with its gray eyes towards her. She puts her hand into her pocket. She unskins the plum with her teeth, withdraws the stone and passes the flesh of the fruit into his mouth.
He whispers again, dragging the listening heart of the young nurse beside him to wherever his mind is, into that well of memory he kept plunging into during those months before he died.

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) Parliamentarian M.A.Sumanthiran yesterday said he does not find any wrong with Vijayakala Maheshwarans statement regarding the LTTE.
He said that the Tamil people will accept a solution on the proposals made by the previous government.
These proposals were made by the previous regime and not by us, he said.
These proposals were made when the LTTE was in operation. If the present government says they will not bring a solution on these proposals, as LTTE is no more in existence, that is wrong, Sumanthiran said.
It means that the government is ready to find a solution, only if the LTTE is still in existence, he said MP Sumanthiran was addressing an event at Karawanella in Magammana.

Hayden donated the marrow to save tiny Skyes life, after the tot was diagnosed with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia just before her first birthday.
Skye had a series of bone marrow transplants, with the final one taking place in April 2017.
Following the procedures, Skyes parents Talia and Todd Savren-McCormick wanted to seek out the person who had saved their daughters life to thank her.
They contacted the organisation that Hayden had used to donate the marrow, Be the Match, and ended up staying touch until Skyes third birthday.
Little Syke received an extra special present on the day  an invite to be part of Haydens nuptials on June 9.
The family travelled from California to Alabama to be part of the special day, and Skye and Hayden met for the first time at the wedding rehearsal.

Tussle over film distribution drags on
The dispute over the rights of distributing local and foreign films in Sri Lanka continues. A press conference was held recently by the four private film circuits: Lanka Film Distributors Ltd. (LFD), E.A.P. Films and Theatres Ltd. (EAP), Movie Producers and Importers Ltd. (MPI) and Cinema Entertainment Ltd. (CEL), to discuss the matter further. Film exhibitors, producers, directors, importers and circuit operators too expressed their views at the event.
A stay order from the Colombo District court preventing NFC taking over the film distribution rights from private sector has been obtained. The film distribution companies noted that the abrupt decision to take over the distribution of films is unfair and a matter that should have been discussed with them to note the issues in the current situation.
We do not want to clash with the NFC or the Minister. We only wish for a fair system, stressed film producer, distributor and exhibitor Sunil T Fernando. Renowned film director Parakrama Jayasinghe ointed out that some deficiencies in the film distribution methodologies had added fuel to this move.
Film distributors are keen to select only films of popular directors in their theaters. They also do not look into the needs of the patrons in some cinemas. For example the stink of the lavatories engulf film halls. The standards of the cinema halls and equipment too are poor, he said adding that there is a need to address these problems.
Popular filmmaker Priyantha Colombage said that the private film circuits always pay them on the dot and support them immensely to publicize their films. Nalaka Vihtanage noted that he is unsure of what to expect from the descision taken by NFC. He added that the payment system and the facilities that will be given by the NFC is not clear and this is a worrying fact for filmmakers. This will actually discourage filmmakers and producers in engaging in filmmaking.
The film distribution companies noted that the freedom of choice of the moviegoers and the exhibitors to choose the content will be disrupted by the move. The quality of content too will become an issue as many of the unreleased films that have been queuing throughout the years are not fit for screening. Stifling competition will not improve the quality of the industry.
The movie industry has grown in Sri Lanka after 2009. The investment in ciemas too has substantially increased. We were planning to invest in building more cinemas outside Colombo, CT Holdings PLC Group Corporate Affairs Director Sanjay C Niles said.
Ceylon Theaters CEO Pravin R David noted that NFC should acts as a regulatory bodym rather than take over the film distribution.
They have handled the matter previously with disastrous consequences. This was from 1979 to 1990. Handing distribution back to NFC is too much of a risk, he expressed.
The Ridma circuit which falls under the NFC distributes around 1/3 of the cinemas. The new decision also states that film halls that will be built in the future will also have to be under the flagship of the NFC.
Ceylon Theatres (Pvt) Ltd (Ceylon Theatres) is the oldest theatre operator in the country and a subsidiary of C T Holdings PLC. They have hosted the Jaffna Film Festival and will be partnering with ANCL for the 34th Sarasaviya Film Awards.

Two Lankans face jail in Singapore for fake British passports
Two Sri Lankan men were sentenced to eight months jail last Thursday (July 5) for owning fake British passports, The Straits Times said in a Singapore datelined report
Nagamany Kangatharan, 46, and Kandasamy Niththiyananthan, 27, were nabbed by Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officers at the transit area of Changi Airport Terminal 3 in June. In a statement on Monday, ICA said that Nagamany and Kandasamy were seeking employment outside of Sri Lanka, and sought help from a Sri Lankan agent to make the arrangements.
Investigations revealed that the agent arranged for their trip to London via Singapore at prices between Sri Lankan Rs. 330,000 (S$2,800) and Rs. 1 million.
The duo flew from Colombo to Singapore using Sri Lanka passports, arriving on June 18. The next day, they met a 31-year-old Malaysian man, Ihsan Ismie Ishak, who handed them the fraudulent British passports.
The passports contained the two mens photos but had particulars that did not belong to them.
At Changi Airport Terminal 1, Nagamany attempted to collect his boarding pass at the check-in counter while Kandasamy observed him.
However, Nagamany was seen leaving the counter hastily, as the ticketing officers took longer than usual to process his boarding pass. Both men then decided to abort their travel plan to London and return to Colombo via Terminal 3.
They met Ihsan Ismie at Terminal 3s transit area, but the three men were quickly arrested by ICA officers who received information about the case. Ihsan Ismie was sentenced to eight months jail on June 28, the statement said.
ICA said that it takes a serious view of those who possess fraudulent travel documents or abet others in committing the offence.
Those found guilty may be sentenced to a maximum of 10 years in prison, fined up to $10,000 or both.

PM tells World Cities Summit
Two urban corridors to spur growth
Two Urban Corridors will be developed soon, one along the 134 km-long Central Expressway leading to Kandy, and the other along the 241 km-long Southern Highway leading to the Hambantota Port and Mattala Airport, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told the World Cities Summit in Singapore yesterday.
The key thrust of the initiative will be the Western Megapolis and the two connecting corridors which will cover nine million people. The Southern corridor will include three large eco-friendly Tourist Resorts of over 500 acres each in addition to a fully restored Galle Heritage Fort, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said, making the Keynote Address at the Summit, which also incorporates the CleanEnviro Summit and the International Water Week. The Summit brought together influential world leaders and business figures. Elaborating on the countrys development plans, the Prime Minister said the mega infrastructure project envisions the Western Province, which includes Colombo and the capital Sri Jayewardenepura as a Megapolis of interconnected metropolitan areas. This would include a Light Rail Transit system with elevated railways, elevated highways, a multi-modal transport hub, the development of old waterways, and three LNG plants. It will encompass a Logistics City, a Forest City, and an Aero City. Sri Lankas long-term objective envisages exploiting our strategic location in the Indian Ocean to ensure economic development in a region which will be pivotal for global economic growth.
We will aim for maximum livability by implementing sewerage and solid waste projects, an Eco Zone, and Riverine Buffer Zone Development. The plans include the development of the ports of Colombo and Hambantota in the South. The new landfill adjacent to the Colombo Port is planned as an offshore Financial Centre, the Prime Minister said.

Four Special Economic Zones will provide the infrastructure for industry. Plans for the megapolis were prepared by Surbana Jurong and the Ministry of Megapolis are in the initial stages of implementation, the Premier added.
Delivering the Keynote Address under the theme Livable and Sustainable Cities of the Future: Transcending Challenges of the Anthropocene, the Prime Minister said he used the term Anthropocene to describe the times we live in because it is an era indelibly shaped by human activity.
The Anthropocene is fundamentally marked by urbanization. Data from the World Bank shows that in 2017, 54.7% of the worlds population  4.1 billion people  lived in urban areas.
Urbanization has been a transformative trend that has propelled economic growth.By bringing people and enterprises together, large cities have become centres of industrialisation and modernisation. They have reaped the benefits of economies of agglomeration. When firms and workers cluster together there is improved productivity and job creation. Mega cities have gone one step further: they have become highly productive centres which connect workers and businesses with global markets. Cities, therefore, have become hubs of wealth creation, attracting waves of people with opportunities for advancement not available in their villages, the Prime Minister said.
He pointed out that these opportunities and challenges are magnified in Asia multi-city agglomerations. The Beijing- Tianjin- Qinhuangdao corridor has a population of over 100 million.
I can see a future where a sprawl of mega urban centres stretches from Beijing to Bangkok to Jakarta to Mumbai.Although cities across Asia are growing apace, only three (Singapore, Tokyo, and Kobe) are in the top 50 of the Mercer Quality of Life index. Colombo was the highest ranked South Asian city, but still only stood at 137 out of 231 cities. At least 15 Asian cities are in the bottom 50 of this ranking, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
Our challenge, as leaders, is to make these Asian cities livable for the present and the future. The sustainable development of our globe depends on whether we succeed or fail, The Premier added.
He cited Singapore as a prime example of a well-managed metropolitan environment that has shown a path to successfully build large yet livable cities.
Singapore offers the best quality of life of all Asian cities, according to Mercers 2018 Quality of Life Survey. Of course, Singapore did not reach this status autonomously: the late Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew envisioned and executed its transformation into a smart, secure and livable city  a standard of distinction being that a woman can walk alone, safely, without being violated anytime of day or night.

More investment opportunities through FTA - Singaporean PM
Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said he will take steps to increase the opportunities for investment through the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and Singapore.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the official Sri Lankan delegation were hosted for lunch by his Singaporean counterpart yesterday. The Singaporean Prime Minister further said that through the FTA opportunities would also open up for investors who are currently investing in Singapore to also invest in Sri Lanka.
Through the FTA, Sri Lanka will be able to obtain access to technology, knowledge and job opportunities, he said. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that by working together in the economic, administrative and social sectors, Sri Lanka and Singapore could together create mutually beneficial programmes.
The Singaporean delegation was represented by Mrs Lee, Information and Communication Minister S. Iswaran, Manpower Minister, Josephine Teo, Singaporean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chandra Das and Chief Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Jeffrey Siow.
The Sri Lankan delegation was represented by Prof. Maitree Wickramasinghe, Water Supply and Town Planning Minister Rauff Hakeem, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa, Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama, Petroleum Resources Development Deputy Minister, Anoma Gamage and Sri Lankan Ambassador to Singapore Nimal Weeratne.

The UNP will field Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe as its candidate for the next Presidential election. The final decision as to whether he will take up the challenge or he has any contrary view or objection to it, rests with Prime Minister Wickremesinghe himself, Sustainable Development, Wild Life and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
Field Marshal Fonseka said this in response to a question posed by the media, during his visit to Naula, Matale, recently.
Field Marshal Fonseka said several other people have also expressed the desire to contest the next Presidential election while many had volunteered to pay the election deposit for certain prospective candidates.
Although it was good to see such persons contesting the Presidential election, it would be a great pity if such people get imprisoned before the next election.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is currently on a tour of Singapore and the Prime Minister had clearly stated that he had no contact or connection with Arjuna Mahendran at present.
Expressing his views of the current political situation in the country, Field Marshal Fonseka said the government would continue for the rest of its term without any problem.
Although the opposition levelled various accusations against the government, it would never allow a repetition of the recent untoward incidents.
He said that even though the employment problem was not fully settled, price of goods and fuel have been maintained at a reasonable level. The government would move forward by remedying the outstanding shortcomings, he added.

Desmond De Silva is a man of very few words but is a singer with a big heart that just overflows with music. There is a fountain of music in this mans heart. Melodies chats with De Silva who uses his talent to make people feel over the moon.
De Silvas introduction to music was in the family. He learnt about music in very intimate settings. His family would get together and those gatherings were the stuff of magic for the young De Silva. It was a wonderful environment to learn about music. He was nurtured in this environment and slowly discovered his calling in life.
Family gatherings were my introduction to music. My parents, uncles and aunties would sit around playing various instruments and singing old favorites. As a child I loved to watch & listen to them. I did not actually have a particular mentor, but I followed the music of Desmond Kelly & Bill Forbes, who used to be very popular when I was growing up, said De Silva.
De Silva is the kind of man who is in his element when he sees others in ecstasy. There is no greater joy for De Silva than seeing them happy and knowing their happy because of his efforts. He is an entertainer and a professional who is a master in his chosen form of expression. He is a man who revels in the knowledge that his music has the power to change the mood.
I love singing as it taps into ones inner joy, making people happy. No matter what they are going through I seem to be able to touch their lives through my music and that is a humbling and yet fulfilling experience, explains De Silva.
Versatility is one of his traits and it has served him well. He has had the fortune of working with talented lyricists, music directors and producers. Together with this formidable team he has gone on to woo audiences and has done this successfully.
I started<U+200B> singing English pop, but went on to sing a number of baila tunes which increased as I was fortunate that I had lyric writers music directors and producers who collaborated on baila songs for me, said De Silva.
It would be correct to say that De Silva can give anyone goosebumps! But then again there are those that have given him goosebumps! When you listen to a song that gives you goosebumps, nothing can beat that feeling! It is a thrilling feeling.
The local artistes that I admire are Wally Bastiansz, C T Fernando, Neville Fernando, Mohideen Baig, HR Jothipala, Rukmani Devi and Latha Walpola. The foreign artistes I admired are Tom Jones, Elvis Presley, Jim Reeves, Dean Martin and The Temptations, said De Silva.
He has put out 875 Sinhala songs and 10 English albums. The most meaningful Sinhala album is The Gramaphone Album and the English one is Motown Hits.
De Silva has an attitude that says Never Give up. He has the attitude that says Impossible is actually Im Possible. He has the attitude that says perseverance is a choice that you make, to go on, no matter what. <U+200B>
I attribute my success to my perseverance and determination to succeed. The message I would give to anyone who wants to succeed in the music field is that practice makes perfect. I believe my music touches people emotionally and makes them happy, said De Silva.

Why Should an exporter apply for an Export Award
Recognition and reward of exporters by the State in many developed and developing countries which accord priority for exports for their economic development, has become an important approach.
This approach is stated to have commenced originally in South Korea several years ago, long before the World Trade Organization (WTO) came into being and imposed rules and regulations for the conduct of international trade between countries. At that time South Korea is stated to have heavily subsidized exports of her enterprises by the State, to be competitive in international markets. Accordingly the Presidential Export Awards which came into being in South Korea is stated to have been patronized by the President himself. However, since then rules and regulations related to international trade under the WTO does not permit subsidizing of exports in an indiscriminate manner.
Japanese products
It has also come to be known that all potential exporters, as well as established export enterprises, who participate at events which accord recognition to their achievements are winners. In this respect it is stated that following the devastation caused by World War II, European countries had been averse to import Japanese products due to their inferior quality and standards. However, Japanese entrepreneurs through their participation at events which recognizes and benchmarks their achievements related to exports, had been able to make vast strides in the improvement of the quality of their products, so much so that in the years that followed, European countries had been reluctant to import Japanese products due to their relatively higher quality, and low cost, which affected the domestic enterprises of those countries.
In Sri Lanka too, following the liberalization of the economy in the late 1970s, the Government commenced under its patronage, through the Export Development Board, The Annual Presidential Export Awards to recognize and reward the achievements of the Sri Lankan exporters, to give them enhanced exposure and compete effectively in the international market place, to accelerate the economic development of the country. This event was given patronage by the State at least at the subject Ministerial level, if not by the Head of State.
Reward achievements of lankan exporters
Thereafter the National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) which is the only private sector chamber that exclusively serves the Sri Lankan exporters, and represents them with the relevant state authorities, stepped into fill this void to recognize and reward the achievements of Sri Lankan exporters. This event conducted by the Chamber which had humble beginnings, with the conferment of a few awards under low key, has grown over the years to achieve national significance, as the most looked forward to Business Event in Sri Lanka. The event which is the only event of its kind that has been conducted over the past 25 years without a break, has been attended by over 750 participants comprising the cream of the business community in Sri Lanka, especially exporters and service providers to exporters, the political leadership, members of the diplomatic Community, high level state officials and special invitees. It is conducted with much glitter and glamour at a five star hotel, and has achieved a high standard of professionalism, credibility, transparency, and recognition, due to its high quality judging process by an independent professional panel of judges who are competent in the various aspects related to exports, assisted by a separate technical panel of experts, and professional inputs provided by the well-known multinational audit firm Ernst & Young.
Theme
The organization and conduct of the event each year is under a theme based on the history of Sri Lanka related to international trade, and current trends. Accordingly the event last year was conducted under the Theme related to the Polonnaruwa era of Sri Lankas international trade.
The event this year will be conducted on the 28th of September in the Main Ballroom of the Shangrila Hotel Colombo, based on the conduct of the Oscars in the USA. A question that would naturally arise in the minds of many is, why should an entrepreneur, potential exporter or an established exporter apply for recognition at this event, and what are the benefits that would accrue to a participant.
The main benefit that would accrue to a participant enterprise, is the recognition and exposure related to its achievements and standard of business in the international market place, to attract the attention of potential buyers of Products and Services, to enable enhancing of exports, and long term sustainability of the enterprise through the expansion of business activities. In this respect, participating enterprises and exporters are accorded the opportunity to showcase their achievements through market promotion activities conducted overseas, by bench-marking the products and services related to their quality and standards. Such market promotion activities also facilitates the attraction of joint venture partners as well as investors, to infuse capital, technology, and know-how as well as access to markets for overall benefit.
Specially designed logo
Award winners under the various product and service categories which are comprehensively covered by the event, are also accorded opportunities under all four categories of enterprises, namely small, medium, large and extra large, depending on their export turnover, to incorporate a specially designed logo for three years from the date of receipt of awards in their promotional material.
In the above context it is also pertinent to mention that in addition to the General Export Awards conferred in respect Products and Services, based on their volume and value as well as export growth, and other aspects related to international trade based on modern trends, Special Awards are conferred to recognize the achievements of exporters related to the other aspects, to give them additional exposure and benefits in the international market place.
Special awards
These special awards cover achievements in value addition, impacts on the environment which includes Waste Recycling and the use of Renewable Sources of Energy, Innovation and Differentiation of Products and Services, Branding related to the achievements of registered Sri Lankan brands, as well as achievements in Emerging Markets. Special awards are also conferred to the best SME exporter and the Best Woman Exporter benefitting these special categories. Further, the event this year will include special awards to export oriented enterprises which recognize the contribution and skills of Disabled Persons, which aspect receives increasing international recognition according to the criteria established by the United Nations.
Award winners at the event also receive immense publicity to their achievements, through the award winning website of the Chamber www.nce.lk to invite the attention of a vast international clientele.
Sri Lanka Exporter magazine
Further wide publicity is also accorded to award winners through the quarterly Sri Lanka Exporter magazine published by the Chamber and distributed to all important trade points both locally and especially overseas, including the Chambers of Commerce and industry in overseas markets and Foreign Trade Missions. The magazine particularly highlights the success stories of award winners related to their achievements in all important aspects of international trade, which comprise in addition to the special features mentioned above, issues related to the General and Financial Management of an enterprise, long term sustainability of the enterprise, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities which impact positively on society, as well as Quality Systems and Standards and Management Development Systems installed and implemented within an enterprise, which undoubtedly would have pointed impact on prospective buyers.
The Award Winning Trophy is itself designed to depict the sustainability aspects of an enterprise related to the triple bottom line of Profitability, People (Human Resources) and the Planet (the environment), which focusses on the achievements of the awarded enterprise related to these three aspects.
In addition to the features outlined above, which serves to attract buyers as well as benefit businesses and in export expansion; winning an award also facilitates enterprises to motivate their employees, by enabling them to witness the fruits of their labour, hard work, and commitment, to achieve further improvements in productivity, thereby ensuring the overall competitiveness of an enterprise in the international market place.The event also benefits all participating enterprises to benchmark their standards against the related international standards, to enable improvement of their weak areas under the guidance of the Chamber. This aspect particularly benefits not only award winners to improve further, but especially those who fail to win an award, to grow, and achieve recognition in the international market place.
All in all winning an export award at the NCE Export Awards, makes an exporter an Icon in the field of exports, in the eyes of all stakeholders; especially in the eyes of existing buyers of products & services, and particularly in the eyes of prospective buyers.

Why you  should  not apply  toothpaste  on your pimple
When it comes to fixing acne, one of the most-common beauty hacks all of us have heard of is applying toothpaste, which happens to work miraculously! The paste contains ingredients like baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, alcohol, etc which help in drying out the pimples. However, applying the toothpaste on acne is not a safe solution, heres why.
Skin irritation
Applying the paste on acne is one of the most tried and tested home remedies. The ingredient triclosan kills the bacteria causing acne on the skin. This ingredient immediately acts on the pimple and gives you fast results and sounds very promising. But, this hack also comes with a lot of skin irritation. The paste is made for teeth, which means the concentration is higher and harsher, hence the itching and the burning sensation is caused.
Dryness
When it comes to those big hideous pimples, toothpaste can immediately decrease the size. You may banish the pimple size, but this will also make your skin extremely dry. If you have acne-prone skin, then you can even witness more zits with the skin irritation and dryness.
Scars
At worst situations, applying the paste on acne can also lead to scars. For those angry red zits, toothpaste will cause a lot of burning sensation, which will eventually dry out the pimple. But with such harsh reaction, sometimes you can also be left with an ugly acne scar.
Stay cautious
Using toothpaste for your acne should be your last resort always! However, if you still feel the need, pick a paste with no added colours or whiteners because these formulas can irritate your skin more and make the acne worse! TNN

Wimbledon magic moments - week 1
LONDON : Magic moments from the first week of Wimbledon:
MONDAY, JULY 2
Federer, the $300 million man
-- Roger Federer boosted his bank balance by $300 million as he marked his 20th straight Wimbledon appearance with a new clothing deal.
The 36-year-old eight-time Wimbledon champion penned a contract with Japanese giants Uniqlo, virtually severing a two-decade association with Nike in the process.
"I was excited to wear Uniqlo today. I must tell you, it's been a long time coming," said defending champion Federer after his first round 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 win over Serbia's Dusan Lajovic on Centre Court.
TUESDAY, JULY 3
Bouchard's mob rule
-- Former runner-up Eugenie Bouchard was happy to be the centre of attention on Court 14 after beating British wildcard Gabriella Taylor 6-0, 4-6, 6-3.
"I felt great support. I saw a lot of Canadian flags. I got mobbed after the match, pretty much. But it's a mob of love, so I liked it," said Bouchard whose dedicated legion of fans is known as 'Genie's Army'.
WEDNESDAY, JULY 4
Bugs life for beaten Wozniacki
-- Second seed Caroline Wozniacki was knocked out in the second round, losing 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 to Ekaterina Makarova and had to fight off an invasion of flying ants as well on Court One.
"They're in my mouth and in my hair and everywhere -- we need to do something. Is there a spray" the Dane complained to the chair umpire.
"I want to be here to focus on tennis, not eating bugs."
THURSDAY, JULY 5
Alison in wonderland
--Wimbledon giantkiller Alison van Uytvanck said she was comfortable coming out as gay, saying "it is not a disease".
The 24-year-old Belgian stunned defending champion and third seed Garbine Muguruza 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to make the third round at the All England Club for the first time.
She then told reporters that she was happy to have come out as gay and talked about her relationship with fellow player Greet Minnen.
"We just decided to not make it personal and not keep it for ourselves. I'm happy," said Van Uytvanck, the world number 47.
"I just feel like we don't have to be ashamed of this, and that's why I also want to be free.
I'm not sick. I don't have a disease. But I just feel like it's good that I could come out as a gay person."
FRIDAY, JULY 6
Serena: "That's what makes me great"
-- Everyone knows that Serena Williams is the greatest player of the modern era, if not of all time.
On Friday, the 36-year-old American admitted it herself.
"Every single match I play, whether I'm coming back from a baby or surgery, it doesn't matter, these young ladies, they bring a game that I've never seen before.
"It's interesting because I don't even scout as much because when I watch them play, it's a totally different game than when they play me.
"That's what makes me great: I always play everyone at their greatest, so I have to be greater."
SATURDAY, JULY 7
Djokovic on the bounce
-- Novak Djokovic admitted he had to stay mentally tough as the three-time champion shrugged off a controversial call against him to beat Kyle Edmund.
Djokovic was furious when he was denied a break of serve in the seventh game of the fourth set on Centre Court when the ball bounced twice before Edmund hit what was ruled a winner.
But the Serb managed to refocus after a lengthy complaint to umpire Jake Garner and eventually secured the break that sealed his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 victory on Centre Court. "I was 100 percent convinced it was a double bounce in the fourth set, but anyone can make a mistake," Djokovic said.
"It was an important point. I asked the chair umpire how is it possible he plays that shot if it didn't bounce twice. It didn't make sense."  AFP

Wimbledon wont budge on World Cup final clash
London, Monday: Wimbledon chiefs insisted again Monday that the mens final will start at its traditional time despite it clashing with a potential England World Cup triumph.
The All England Club has come under increasing pressure to rethink its 2pm (1300GMT) start time for Sundays mens singles final with the football showpiece in Moscow kicking off at 4pm in the UK (1500GMT).
Should England defeat Croatia in Wednesdays semi-final then the national team will feature in a World Cup final for the first time since lifting the trophy in 1966.
It is purely our decision to stay at 2pm. It will stay this year, it will stay next year, said All England Club chief executive Richard Lewis.
He added that there were no plans to show either Wednesdays semi-final or Sundays final at the World Cup on Wimbledons giant TV screen attached to one of the sides of Court One. Last Saturday, England made the semi-finals with victory over Sweden as action at Wimbledon took place.
Saturday was one of the most special days I can remember at the championships. The tennis was very good and there as an historic football match going on, added Lewis.
People followed the football on their devices thanks to modern technology without disturbing other spectators.
You can tell when England scored and it was wonderful but we didnt receive any complaints that the enjoyment of tennis had been spoiled.
I am sure the same again will happen on Wednesday -- and hopefully on Sunday.
He added: People get Wimbledon and we get the balance right.
Lewis has become exasperated by stories that the All England Club has been indifferent to the national wave of affection which has engulfed Gareth Southgates football team.
We have a very strong public wi-fi signal and it worked brilliantly on Saturday, he said.
That indicates that we are supportive of the World Cup and that we are not turning down the signal strength!
We are a tennis tournament but we are aware that there is something special going on elsewhere.
I have met Gareth Southgate, hes a great guy. Jeremy Dier (the father of England star Eric Dier) is a member of the club. I have known Eric since he was a teenager.
Should England make the final on Sunday, its possible that the mens final may not be even over -- especially if Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal involved. Ten years ago, Nadal triumphed over his great rival in a five-set epic which ended at 9.16pm (2016GMT).
Meeanwhile, Croatias Donna Vekic, who was knocked out of Wimbledon by Julia Goerges of Germany in the fourth round on Monday, said she will be sending good vibes to her countrys football team in Russia.
I think it would be huge if we win. We are a country of four million people, said the 22-year-old who will not still be in London when the semi-final is being broadcast.
I saw a few pictures the size of Croatia compared to size of Russia, and I think if we are already to be in semi-finals is unbelievable. AFP

## Title: Wise move by Army Chief

Wise move by Army Chief
Army Commander Lt.Gen. Mahesh Senanayake has instructed his troops not to entertain former army officers, opportunistic politicians and certain civil society activists into army camps or participate in events organised by such individuals and groups. Issuing a memo to military officers in charge of army camps, the Commander said certain opportunistic politicians, former army officers and civil society activists were criticizing the governments reconciliation mechanism and the role the army played therein. They also praise the LTTE and are attempting to destroy the goodwill the people have towards the government and the army. The media had revealed who these elements were, the Army Chief noted.
It is not clear who the politicians or civil society activists that were targeted by the Army Chief, who, according to him, were engaged in poisoning the minds of the army personnel. However, there is no doubt who the ex-military officers the Commander had in mind. Currently, the likes of retired army officers Major General Kamal Gunaratne and Rtd. Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekera are displaying open hostility towards the government and is critical of its reconciliation efforts and the alleged witch-hunt carried out against former military officers, now jailed in connection with criminal offenses. It is not clear if these two officers visited army camps to sow hatred towards the government and condemn its reconciliation efforts. But they could easily get their agents to do so. One recalls that during the 2005 Presidential election campaign Wimal Weerawansa was visiting military camps in the North to urge their inmates to vote for Mahinda Rajapaksa. A similar attempt could not be ruled out in this instance as well, what with major elections just one and half years away, with the duo getting their agents to politically influence the army.
Already some of these ex-military men are thick in the campaign to elect Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the countrys next President, openly addressing meetings of the Viy(p)ath Maga and Eliya, in the presence of the former Defence Secretary. In the process, provocative statements are made against the reconciliation efforts of the government- one of the above mentioned duo even authoring a book giving an account of his own heroism on the battle front but also railing against the governments alleged surrender to the Tamil diaspora.
Needless to say, politicization of the military is a dangerous game that could have dire consequences for the country. Up until 2015 retired military officers kept away from politics. The advent of veterans on the political stage is a new phenomenon in this country. Perhaps, they have been influenced by Gotabhaya who may have fought alongside some of these men who are now assisting his campaign.
In any event, ex-military officers trying to politically influence soldiers cannot be condoned. In this country, since Independence, the military has all along been apolitical, unlike in countries such as Pakistan where the military still has a stake in the political establishment and coups not far from the surface.
Be that as it may, the government should be alert to this whole exercise and take the strongest possible action against those attempting to brainwash the army. The neutral stand taken by the military establishment should be preserved at all costs. The army, as a unit, has never known to take sides, politically speaking. It is well known that former Military Commander Daya Ratnayake was one of those opposed to the alleged plot by the Rajapaksas to remain in power by force, on election night. President Premadasa had no hesitation in appointing Denzil Kobbekaduwa, Army Commander, at a crucial stage of the Eelam war despite the latters kinship to Sirima Bandaranaike. This is because of the confidence the leaders of this country had in the Armys neutrality, at all times.
Like Lt. General Senanayake said, the Army is playing a not inconsiderable role is fostering reconciliation. The recent emotional scenes in the North at the leave taking of a military officer in charge of the rehabilitation of ex-LTTE cadres, spoke volumes of the extent of the fence mending that has taken place. Nothing should be made to get in the way of this rapport that is being built by the two sidestep- military officers, whatever had been their heroism on the battlefield in the past, should not meddle in this process.
Army camps should also be made a no go zone for politicians. Attempts, certainly, would be made by politicos, playing the communal card, to influence the army to vote for one of their kind. The army is and has always been neutral, as already mentioned, and any attempt to change the status quo should not be condoned. By the same token, the army should also not be used to do the bidding of politicians. We say this because for the first time, the army were used to rig elections when Anurudhdha Ratwatte unleashed soldiers in Wayamba for mass stuffing of ballot boxes, marking a black day for the military. Hopefully, the army, which has endeared itself much to the public, would not blot its copy book, ever again, in similar fashion.

Court cases against SAITM opposes unacceptable
Justice should be served for medical students, doctors and parents who fought against the SAITM, Media Spokesman for the State Medical Students' Parents' Union Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, he said over 12,000 LTTE terrorists received a pardon. Similarly, a pardon should be granted for medical students, doctors, Bhikkus, parents of state medical students etc. who are now facing legal action. They should be pardoned, released and justice should be served, he said.
According to Alwis, court cases had been filed against those who stood against the SAITM, pressing fabricated charges.
Now, medical students have to appear before courts wasting their valuable time allocated for attending lectures. This is totally unacceptable. LTTE terrorists fought to destroy the country and medical students fought to protect free education, Alwis said.
Ignoring all recommendations, it had been decided to absorb the SAITM students to the Kotalawela Defence University on three simple passes in the Advanced Level Examination. But with three simple passes, nobody can obtain a job, even as a minor employee in an institution at present. It is totally unacceptable to accommodate unqualified students, wasting valuable tax money of the people, he added.

UK, US allegations against Sri Lanka hypocritical
Lord Nasebythe Sri Lankan Governments longstanding advocate in the UKhad repeatedly called for a more relaxed treatment of Sri Lanka by the United Nations (UN). This time, Naseby highlighted the hypocrisy of nations such as the UK and US accusing Sri Lanka of breaching human rights.
After reading the report published by the UK Parliaments Intelligence and Security Committee, Lord Baron Naseby urged the UK and US to withdraw the United Nations Human Rights Councils (UNHRC) motion against Sri Lanka.
The British report revealed instances where the UK condoned and sometimes instigated torture and mistreatment of its prisoners. Citing this, Naseby said, Both the UK and the US must know their actions undermine the UN Charter and its Human Rights provisions.
Lord Naseby had been a member of the British House of Lords for 44 years. He founded the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Sri Lanka in 1975. He had called on the UN Human Rights Commission to rescind its resolution against Sri Lanka on more than one occasion.
After gaining access to censored dispatches by British High Commission Defence Attache Lt. Col. Anton Gash in Colombo, in 2009, Naseby had repeatedly claimed that death figures during the latter stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War were exaggerated.
After a visit to Sri Lanka in 2017, Naseby addressed the House of Lords and said, After 30 years of war, there is peace across the whole island. In the same address, he voiced his opposition to the UNHRCs resolution, saying, Its quite clear to me, from the context I have, that the government has addressed all issues raised in the UN Resolutions.
This past April, he met with President Maithripala Sirisena in London, and was championed by the President as a true ally of Sri Lanka.

30 years in business: Ceylinco Lifes Relationship for Life
For 14 of the 30 years it has been in operation, Ceylinco Life has been the marker leader in Sri Lankas life insurance industry. In this interview, the companys Managing Director,CEO, R. Renganathan emphasises that a steadfast focus on fundamentals, an innovative approach to market development, a high degree of engagement with customers, empathy with the community and commitment to employees are the secrets to Ceylinco Lifes Relationship for Life.
Excerpts:
Q: Ceylinco Life completed 30 years of operation earlier this year. In your opinion, what has been the companys biggest contribution to the industry
A: We have been the pioneer of many firsts over the past three decades, but overall, our biggest contribution to life insurance would be our unwavering commitment to the fundamental precept that life insurance is a Relationship for Life. This underpins everything we do, and has resulted in nearly a million lives being entrusted to our protection. We have shown the industry that success in life insurance is driven by the depth of the engagement with ones policyholders, and the degree of care that a life insurance company demonstrates. This cannot be limited to slogans, but must be evident in the products, the service, and actions of the life insurer. The fact that Ceylinco Life has been the undisputed market leader in life insurance for 14 years  almost half of the companys existence  makes us an excellent case study for others. In short, we have proved that gimmicks and short term money-making tactics have no place in life insurance.
Q: How did this all begin A relationship for life must be hard to establish when a company is new
A: While that is true, Ceylinco Life did have the advantage of being the successor to Ceylon Insurance Company, the first Sri Lankan company to be registered in 1939 under the Companies Ordinance introduced that year. We therefore inherited the legacy of a trailblazing predecessor. We commenced operations on 14th January 1988, with the concept of the Miracle of Life Insurance --a life insurance company mobilises the small savings of people which are then invested in the government and the private sector; the government uses this money to invest in the countrys infrastructure while the private sector uses this money to lend to businessmen to develop their businesses; both these activities generate employment thereby providing further prospects for our business.
This was only an illustration at the beginning. It is now a reality as we have seen this work over the past 30 years, and Ceylinco Life has played a major role in the economy of our country.
Q: What are some of Ceylinco Lifesfirsts that you can recall
A: Our three-tiered structure for the sales operation comprising of a Branch Head, Unit Head and Sales Consultants was introduced by Ceylinco Life at the inception of the company and is now a standard in the industry. We pioneered Tele underwriting, the procedure of calling the customer and confirming details before policy issuance in order to ensure accuracy of information and to avoid issues relating to non-disclosure at the point of making a claim. Ceylinco Life also gets the credit for initiatives such as Life Insurance Week and Retirement Planning Month, annual country-wide programmes that have been copied by others; Family Savari  by far the largest interactive customer promotion cum engagement in the industry; and the Pranama Scholarshipsprogramme through which we have rewarded academic and extracurricular achievements of more than 2,400 students and young Sri Lankans over the past 17 years.
Q: All of this requires substantial financial strength. Where does Ceylinco Life stand after 30 years of operation
A: In terms of financial strength and stability, Ceylinco Life is in an unassailable position that is remarkable in the context that it has been achieved in just 30 years. In 2017, we were the most profitable life insurance company in Sri Lanka with a net profit of Rs 9.46 billion. Our Life Fund exceeded Rs 81.7 billion at the end of 2017 and is the fastest growing in the industry. Our Risk-Based Capital Adequacy Ratio is 375% of the statutory minimum Capital Requirement for the industry.
This ratio measures the amount of available capital relative to the risks inherent in the companys liabilities and the assets backing those liabilities. Our premium income for 2017 was Rs 15.7 billion, the highest in the sector. Total income, comprising of premium income and investment and other income was Rs 25.9 billion and the value of Ceylinco Lifes investment portfolio totalled Rs 92.2 billion as at 31stDecember 2017.
Q: How does the companys financial strength benefit its policyholders
A: First and foremost, it means that our policyholders can rest easy in the knowledge that their life insurance partner will always be able to fulfil its promises and obligations. In fact, Ceylinco Life has paid out nearly Rs 29 billion in claims to policyholders during the past five years alone, at an average of almost Rs 6 billion a year. On average, we settle 125 death claims and 1,540 medical claims per month. Additionally, our policyholders have received Rs 24 billion in annual bonuses over the past 10 years, and thepay-out increases annually  Rs 2.9 billion in 2015, Rs 3.8 billion in 2016 and Rs 4.4 billion in 2017. Ceylinco Life has also paid nearly Rs 600 million in cash bonuses to policyholders as a reward for loyalty, and is the only life insurer in Sri Lanka to pay such cash bonuses. Policyholders also benefit from the Family Savari promotion I already referred to.
To date, more than 24,000 Ceylinco Life policyholders have enjoyed all-expenses-paid overseas tours to Singapore, China, Dubai, Paris, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, England and Rome as well as day-long visits to the Leisure World theme park. On top of all this, as I already mentioned, some 2,400 children of policyholders have received Rs 131 million in scholarships through the Pranama scholarships programme.
Q: What about the community Does Ceylinco Life support any important causes
A: We have always been attuned to the importance of understanding and fulfilling the pressing needs of the community. The company has an extensive portfolio of corporate social responsibility commitments that are principally focussed on health and education. One of our flagship initiatives in the sphere of health is the Waidya Hamuwa programme under which a team of doctors and medical technicians funded by Ceylinco Life carries out a series of free medical camps in rural areas of the country.
This programme has to date helped more than 138,000 people. The company has also built, equipped and donated High Dependency Units to four hospitals to date, the Colombo South Teaching Hospital, Kalubowila, the National Hospital, Colombo, the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital and the Jaffna Teaching Hospital.
In the sphere of education, Ceylinco Life has built 70 classrooms for rural schools to facilitate the educationof children in under-served areas.
Q:An operation of such size must require a large base of employees. How has Ceylinco Life rewarded them for its success
A: Ceylinco Life is made up of nearly 5,000 people, including permanent employees and salesofficers. We have always acknowledged that our people are one of the pillars of our success, and we generously reward performance. Over the past 30 years we have seen a significant increase in income levels of our sales force, and over the past five years alone, Ceylinco Life has paid out Rs 7.5 billion in commissions to the companys sales consultants.
They have also been rewarded through numerous sales competitions which in 2017 alone presented close to Rs 50 million in cash prizes in addition to providing foreign tours to the United Kingdom, China, Dubai, Singapore, Malaysia and other countries. Ceylinco Life also emphasises the importance of professional development and provides its employees and sales consultants numerous opportunities to obtain internationally-recognised qualifications.

Agonising wait for remaining Thai cave boys
THAILAND: Cave divers in Thailand are poised to restart the high-risk operation to extract the remaining eight boys and their football coach from a vast flooded cave system.
Four boys were brought safely out of the cave on Sunday. But the mission was paused overnight for air tanks to be replaced. The boys became trapped in the cave on 23 June after heavy rains caused flooding, but were found alive last week by divers.
Rescuers decided to go ahead with the hazardous operation to free them because of fears that waters would rise again.
Activity at the dive site early on Monday suggests that the operation may have resumed or be about to resume. But there has been no confirmation. At least seven ambulances have driven towards the cave entrance.
Rescuers took advantage of a break in the rain on Sunday to launch the mission earlier than some expected.
The first stage of the mission ran smoothly and the rescued boys were in good health, according to the Thai authorities.
But with heavy rainfall overnight and more forecast for the coming days, divers will need to work quickly to free those still trapped. On Saturday, Narongsak Osottanakorn, governor of the Chiang Rai province, said that teams had a three to four-day window to carry out their operation.
A team of 90 expert divers - 40 from Thailand and 50 from overseas - has been working in the cave system.
They have been guiding the boys through darkness and submerged passageways towards the mouth of the Tham Luang cave system.
Getting to and from where the boys are has been an exhausting round trip, even for the experienced divers.
The process includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place.
Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply.

United National Party (UNP) General Secretary Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam yesterday challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make a statement in Parliament that he has never received any financial gratuities from a Chinese company as revealed in the New York Times.
He said if Rajapaksa has not taken money, he should clearly state this in Parliament.
The Minister said that the government will not allow anyone responsible for crimes and corruption in the past to escape or avoid punishment.
He said the government has set up a mechanism to ensure speedy trials through special courts in order to bring to justice those responsible for corruption and crimes, irrespective of status.
Addressing a public event in Colombo, the Minister said the people would give a fitting reply to those who are trying to spread religious and ethnic disharmony in order to divert attention from their wrongdoings.

Alleged misuse of state vehicles by Wimal: Court sends reminder to AG
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday re-sent a reminder to the Attorney General directing him to expedite legal advice regarding National Freedom Front leader MP Wimal Weerawansa for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government. When the case came up before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the Court was informed that the FCID was yet to receive Attorney Generals advice regarding the two suspects.
The FCID has sought the Attorney Generals advice regarding future legal action against two suspects, Wimal Weerawansa and Samantha Lokuhennadige under Reference Number CRS/14/17.
They are currently out on bail. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for November 19 and the prosecution was directed to report the progress of the inquiry on next hearing date.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval to the commission to commit these offences under Public Property Act and Penal Code while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions."
"However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister."
"Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID had told Court.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.
Counsel Kapila Gamage appeared for MP Wimal Weerawansa.

A corruption case filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs.11.4 billion to the government when granting permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Ltd to operate a floating armoury, was removed from the trial list by the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court, yesterday.

Belgium and France face off in mouth-watering semi-final
ST PETERSBURG, Monday - Roberto Martinezs swashbuckling Belgium side head into Tuesdays semi-final with familiar foes France as the World Cups leading scorers, but their old rivals have evolved as the tournament has progressed and will also be full of confidence.
Belgium have scored 14 goals in five matches and were hugely impressive in their 2-1 quarter-final victory over Brazil, with Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne combining to devastating effect to oust the five-times world champions.
In contrast, France sleep-walked through the group stages, eking out wins over Australia and Peru before a stultifying 0-0 draw with Denmark.
Their early struggles had Les Bleus being written off in some quarters, but all that changed when they faced Argentina in the last 16 in what must be a leading contender for the most exciting match of the tournament.
Didier Deschamps tweaked his formation, effectively freeing up Kylian Mbappe on the right to run at the Argentine defence, and what followed was a wonderful display of attacking football that France won 4-3.
The victory boosted Frances morale, and they followed it up with a workman-like 2-0 win over Uruguay that was impressive because of how well they managed to control the game against tricky opponents.
Belgium faced a heart-stopping moment of uncertainty in the first knockout round against Japan, when Martinezs decision to rest players in their final group match against England almost backfired spectacularly.
Belgiums returning first team players made a sluggish start against the Samurai Blue and suddenly found themselves trailing by two goals with time ebbing away.
Stung into action, Martinez sent on Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli in the 65th minute, and both were heavily involved as Belgium pulled off a late comeback, with Chadli securing victory with practically the last kick of the game.
Against Brazil in the quarters, Martinez showed tactical adventure, as he pushed target man Lukaku to the wing to allow De Bruyne to operate as a false nine. The strategy worked, and De Bruyne scored his first goal in Russia.
Tuesdays clash in St Petersburg has all the makings of a classic, with fans and viewers likely to be treated to the sight of two wonderfully attacking teams going toe-to-toe.
Its a super exciting game with great players on both sides, France defender Benjamin Pavard said. Its going to be a mans match and we will have to step up.
France, world champions in 1998, are slight favourites to go through according to most bookmakers, but Belgium tend to step up their game against these particular European rivals, if history is anything to go by.
Of the 73 meetings between the teams, Belgium have won 30 and France 24, with 19 draws between them, although if Belgium are to reach their first World Cup final they will have to do so by beating France at the tournament for the first time.
France came through their quarter-final unscathed, and Deschamps has his entire squad to choose from, while Belgium are only slightly worse off.
Full back Thomas Meunier is suspended after picking up a second yellow card of the tournament against Brazil, with Martinez likely to bring in Yannick Carrasco in his place.

Belgium's Hazard spells World Cup danger for France
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Sunday - Eden Hazard is one of the French academy system's finest exports in the past decade but he could be the man to end Didier Deschamps's bid for World Cup glory.
Born to two footballing parents in the Belgian municipality of Braine-le-Comte, Hazard's reputation spread across the border and saw him snapped up by Lille at the age of just 14.
Two years later Hazard made his professional debut in Ligue 1 and went on to become French football's brightest talent, twice winning the league's player of the year prize and leading Lille to a Ligue 1 and Cup double in 2010-11.
When a big-money move inevitably came, it was Chelsea who won the race in 2012 with a 32 million ($43 million) capture that now seems like a bargain. In six seasons in England, Hazard has won two more league titles and won plenty of admirers. But some doubt whether he has the desire to back up his immense talent and challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the world's best player. So far in Russia, Hazard looks like a man on a mission to ensure Belgium's so-called golden generation live up to their billing by bringing home the World Cup for the first time in the country's history.
Handed the armband by Roberto Martinez despite Vincent Kompany's return from injury, the Spaniard has drawn out Hazard's leadership qualities.
I think Eden is in a great moment of his career, Martinez said before the tournament. Look at his age, he is the captain, in terms of leadership -- he never finds it difficult to show for the ball.
LEADING BY EXAMPLE
Hazard's willingness and ability to carry the ball under pressure, jinking past helpless defenders, was in evidence as Belgium claimed their greatest-ever World Cup scalp by beating Brazil in the quarter-finals. With his side clinging onto a 2-1 lead, Hazard repeatedly carried the ball forward in the dying minutes, drawing fouls to offer the Belgian backline some respite. His leadership was also in evidence with a man-of-the-match performance, including a wonderful assist for Marouane Fellaini's equaliser, as the Red Devils came from 2-0 down to beat Japan 3-2 in the last 16.
In outshining Brazil's Neymar in the last eight, Hazard may have put himself in the shop window.
At 27, he has not hidden his ambition to finally make an impact on the Champions League, which Chelsea missed out on after a disappointing fifth-placed finish in the Premier League last season.
Long linked with a transfer to Real Madrid, a move to Spain looks more realistic this summer than at any time of his Chelsea career, with Madrid president Florentino Perez often influenced by outstanding World Cup performances and Ronaldo looking set to exit the Santiago Bernabeu. Even if a move to Madrid does materialise, Hazard will be denied a self-confessed dream of working under another French influence on his formation as a player, Zinedine Zidane.
As a child, Hazard used to study videos of the man who led France to the World Cup in 1998 -- and stepped down as Real boss in May, to hone and copy his skills.
Twenty years on, he's just two games away from matching Zidane's feat.
To do so, though, he must prevent France's own talented crop of Paul Pogba, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann from following in Zidane's footsteps in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Tuesday, July 10, 2018 - 01:00
Birthday bash with a dash of wild panache!
I never imagined that the mention of my birthday last Thursday, the fifth of July would evoke such a huge response. Being a rather modest scribbler I would never have contemplated that my name had become a household word among so many readers. That would have been a laugh as far as I am concerned. Because my name isn't even a household word in my own home!
So every 4th and 5th of July I raise a glass or three to the land of Uncle Sam with a heart-felt toast of Happy Birthday America! Essentially, it is because I like to think that the whole of the most powerful nation on earth reciprocates by celebrating my own birthday which happens to roll by around this time. That is also when I wave the American flag manufactured in China.
Yes siree, one of their favourite 4th of July traditions actually takes place after the Star-Spangled holiday is already over. That is when the dum-dums, drunks and pyromaniacs start uploading their near misses of my birth-date with a bombardment of bangs and booms.
As the night skies above them explode with spectacular showers of pyrotechnics all my relatives and friends in Yankee-Doodle-Dandy-Land will start calling and wishing me on the landmark occasion. I must concede that I am grateful for their kind wishes. I think it is really kind on their part remembering the milestone occasion.
But I must concede it is rather head-swelling when I imagine the whole of the North American continent, some 10,000 miles away celebrating their National Day, which according to the International Dateline falls on my birthday.
So far, the 5th of July has brought me to the realisation that this year happens to make me the oldest I have ever been! So what the heck, I did celebrate with a good many people who happen to be family and friends. And no one will complain about the monumental hangovers, the effects of which will not wear off for a week.
That is because I usually only drink on two occasions. Meaning when it is my birthday and when it is not. But let me tell you that the pain of ageing is not something you want to hear when you are turning 60. Ok, ok, which to be perfectly honest was actually more than a decade ago. Oh, all right I am not uncomfortable about my age but I do not want to proclaim it from the rooftops. Although that is what the dreadful little grandkids had been doing weeks before the big day.
It seems funny how birthdays can instil terror in the hearts of so many old fogeys. The word has only to be mentioned to conjure up images of those first awkward moments in babyhood and beyond. You know, the earliest educational period in your life that seemed to throw you from the cradle to crayons and clay. And when you actually think about it, it may be a terrifying prospect to imagine how soon life can take you from clay to dust.
But for me and some of my surviving cohorts, being over 60 and pushing three score and ten can certainly be considered a phenomenal achievement. A miracle, one might call it, in the case of a few of us who have lived dangerously most of our lives. Yes, a handful of my old Yahoo buddies and I have thrived on living our dreams, even if it meant courting potentially perilous or suicidal situations.
And we still do. Peoples perception of our frame of mind has been altogether different from our infancy to our adolescence and adulthood. Or as some ancient malaprop once said: I knew him from his infancy to his adultery! The old adage still stands good, with a little amendment of course: Boys will be boys and so will a lot of middle-aged and, ahem, older men.
But then again at my age when many people consider themselves over the hill and are thankful for not being under it, is where the trouble begins. As an older guy, I am expected to be quiet, stay in the background and stop being my old, or is it young rambunctious self Being blessed with youthful energy and exuberance I am having some difficulty fitting into this unaccustomed role. The older I grow the more I distrust the familiar doctrine that age brings wisdom. Setting an example for your children and grand children takes all the fun out of ageing.
Having said that, I think it would also be apt to remind you of another old axiom that there is no fool like an old fool, except of course a young fool. But the young fool has first to grow up to be an old fool to realise what a darn fool he was when he was a young fool. All this leads me to the logical conclusion that with both young and old fools in existence life should be considered an All Fools Paradise.
No surprise then that I determine my physical age as opposed to the chronological. The more perceptive among you would have realised by now that my body when measured by the physical age yardstick makes me a much younger man. That is perhaps why I can be likened to the US and A, considering we both have a solid constitution. Still I am not a fussbudget about my age.
In addition, I am not the type to begin lusting after my lost youth when mine was spent mostly downing double drams and writing what I like. Two things I am pretty darn good at, even if I do say so myself. As you can see I am still enjoying this privileged lifestyle while retaining my youthful spirit and debonair air.
Yes, it is true that few women admit their age. But it is also correct that few men act theirs. I like birthdays but in moderation. That is because I think too many can kill you.
As for you disappointed readers out there I will let you know later about the big bash the family threw for me.
Yet I will accept belated greetings and good wishes from you reading men folk out there. As for the charming lady readers, well Ill simply close my eyes. That way you dont have to fuss or blush when you rush to offer me a sound buss.
Meaning its not late to give an old, bold and uncontrolled buckaroo a stunning smackeroo!

He said the location of the hotel is in an up market area and in addition to foreign clients they also have good forward bookings from natives as well who are also high spenders.
He said that due to this they are looking at a ROI in three years. Asked to comment on their other overseas plans he said that they want extend their leisure foot print to Bangladesh and India as well. We are looking for opportunities.

Electricity from garbage next year
Electricity would be generated from garbage from June next year, bringing a solution to the garbage menace, said Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka.
The minister said plans are afoot to set up two such power generation plants. Solid waste has been planned to be disposed in a site in Aruwakkalu in Puttlam. He added that the latter project would commence by October this year.
"Even the schoolchildren can play a vital role in assisting to organize garbage disposal by minimizing the garbage disposed from schools," Minister Ranawaka said. "The students of Ananda College could play a leading role by setting an example to other schools too."
He made this observation yesterday at the ceremony to open the Sampath Piyasa for collecting waste at Ananda College, Colombo.
He said D S Senanayake College too has come to a decision not to dispose a single gram of garbage out of the school after one of their students died in the Meethotamulla garbage collapse which brought death to 34 persons. "And they have been successful," Minister Ranawaka said.
He said the Methotamulla garbage dump which extends in 21 acres, is bigger than Galle Face Green which is 18 acres. He added that it slid catastrophically on New Years Day in 2017 April. The President handed the issue over to me to manage. However, it was managed and we have many long term plans.
The Minister said in 1997, Karu Jayasuriya as the Mayor attempted to solve the issue by disposing garbage scientifically. But politicians protested and prevented such a move. "Finally it created Bloemendhal and Meethotamulla garbage dumps that in turn took the lives of 34 persons."
He said the garbage, waste and plastic pollute the environment too. "The generation living today has polluted the environment and the children who are the next generation have to prevent it and find solutions," Minister Ranawaka said.

England dream of World Cup glory as Russian fans thank team
MOSCOW, Sunday - England were Sunday looking forward to their first World Cup semi-final since 1990 as Russian fans thanked their disappointed players after their fairytale World Cup run was halted by Croatia.
Gareth Southgate's young team swept Sweden aside 2-0 on Saturday, sparking mass celebrations in England, where at least 20 million people watched the match on TV.
They will face Croatia, who had to endure a strength-sapping penalty shootout for the second consecutive match, in front of 80,000 people in Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday.
But first Roberto Martinez's exciting Belgian side will attempt to reach their first ever World Cup final when they play favourites France in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday.
England is basking in the team's run to the last four of the World Cup as fans start to believe that they can lift the trophy for the first time since 1966.
Southgreat trumpeted the Sun on Sunday. Cry God for Harry, England and St George! said the Sunday Telegraph. Goals from Leicester defender Harry Maguire and Tottenham's Dele Alli sealed victory against Sweden in Samara while man-of-the-match Jordan Pickford made three outstanding saves.
England's players have guaranteed they will return from the World Cup as heroes. Now they can dream of a grander ambition. Can they come home as legends asked former England defender Jamie Carragher in a column for the Sunday Telegraph.
NO FIFA BAN FOR VIDA
Croatia defender Domagoj Vida escaped a FIFA ban on Sunday after posting a clip dedicating his country's victory over Russia in the quarter-finals to Ukraine.

Export revenue expected to boost as National Export Strategy receives cabinet nod
The Cabinet of Ministers approved the National Export Strategy (NES).
The NES is a comprehensive and carefully structured five-year strategy aimed at increasing exports and generating enhanced revenue for Sri Lankas SMEs and exporters. The implementation of this endeavour will witness the increasing of Sri Lankas export revenue to USD$ 28 billion by 2022.
The NES priority sectors have been selected to ensure a balanced export expansion from visionary, emerging and mature sectors. In line with the objectives of the NES for an innovative and diversified export sector, the national stakeholders, using quantitative and qualitative information, have selected the following industries: IT-BPM, Spices & Concentrates, Wellness Tourism, Processed Food & Beverages, Boat-building, and Electrical & Electronic machinery.
The NES will improve the business environment for all Sri Lankan enterprises. While the NES provides the conditions to enable diversification by strengthening emerging sectors, all export industries of Sri Lanka will benefit from the increased performance of key Trade Support Functions. These include Logistics, National Quality Infrastructure, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and Trade Information and Promotion.
The approving of the NES highlights the strong commitment of the Government to increase Sri Lankas export potential to project Sri Lanka as the next regional trade hub. The approval by Cabinet now paves the way for the launch of the NES which will take place in July 2018.
With approval from the Cabinet, Sri Lanka now has the opportunity to catch up with fast-growing Asian exporting countries. The NES aims to empower the emergence of new champions while supporting growth of traditional export industries. Major systemic issues hindering the rapid expansion of Sri Lankas exports will be corrected to favour growth of higher-technology and knowledge-intensive exports, which are less vulnerable to cost shifts.
The NES is a flagship development project spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (MODSIT) and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) together with public private partnership.
Commenting on the approval by Cabinet, Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama stated that, The focus of the Government is to shift the economic growth model from one that was heavily dependent on debt fuelled public infrastructure spending, to growth driven by more public enterprises, exports and foreign direct investment
Complementing the words of Minister Samarawickarama, State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe at the MoDSIT said, As Sri Lankas export basket diversifies and with renewed interests in newer products in the local markets, trade information and promotion will help to market Sri Lanka to foreign investors. I am confident therefore that the National Export Strategy will have a tangible role in attracting more Foreign Direct Investment to Sri Lanka.
Working closely with the EDB and other public-private stakeholders in the run up to Cabinet approval of the NES was Chandanie Wijayawardhana, Secretary to the MODSIT who was confident that The National Export Strategy will have a tangible impact on how trade is being done in Sri Lanka and will give way to suitable trade reform.
The National Export Strategy is well aligned with, complements and operationalises other national initiatives such as enterprise Sri Lanka and Vision 2025. Vision 2025 seeks to create a Blue-Green economy, harnessing the resources of the ocean surrounding us and the green environmental resources around us.
The National Export Strategy is reinvigorating the trading environment and maximising its potential to usher in a period of sustained growth, aimed at increasing livelihoods for millions of Sri Lankans. The NES is navigating Sri Lanka to its rightful place in the Indian Ocean, as a sophisticated, innovative and dynamic trade hub serving Asia and beyond.

## Title: Family-friendly, but not a kids movie
## Supertitle: The Incredibles 2
## Section: T&C
## Date: Tuesday, July 10, 2018 - 01:00
The Incredibles 2
Family-friendly, but not a kids movie
Like the first film, The Incredibles 2 defies the genre of kids movie. Writer and creator of The Incredibles franchise, Brad Bird, recently addressed parents who criticised The Incredibles 2 on Twitter. Parents said the film used mature language and bored at least one four-year-old viewer.
In response, Bird Tweeted: With all due respect, it is NOT a kids movie. It is animated, and rated PG.
While both Incredibles movies are family-friendly, neither is written for children, hence its mass-appeal. In fact, general audiences account for 57 percent of viewers, while parents and children represent 12 percent and 31 percent. The Incredibles 2 has already surpassed the box office earnings of its predecessor worldwide (even with inflation), raking in almost $650 million USD.
14 years later, The Incredibles 2 picks up exactly where The Incredibles left off, as the family splits up in pursuit of The Underminer. The Incredibles manage to stop The Underminers rogue drill, but not before it destroys large parts of the city. Police swarm the superheroes and blame them for the destruction.
If youd simply deferred to the procedures in place! yells one officer, referring to the banks insurance plan. Youd rather we do nothing asks Mr. Incredible. Yes, he replies.
In a world where Supers are illegal, the Incredibles are reprimanded for not cowing down to the rules, even if, as Mr. Incredible (aka Bob Parr) says, those rules are unfair. Agent Dicker of the NSA (National Superpowers Agency) states the problem in different terms: Politicians dont understand people who do good just because its right. Theyve been gunning for Supers for years.
Underlying the world of The Incredibles are larger conversations about governance in the U.S. Supers represent an imagined past uncomplicated by government systems; this is partly what gives Supers their appeal. In The Incredibles 2, as Elastagirl drives through a crowd of her adoring fans, the radio in the car says, When it comes to decision-making, people have more faith in a monkey throwing darts than Congress. Whereas a Super can make quick decisions with clear goals in mind, the governments slow and ungainly progress tends to lose public confidence.
The Incredibles 2 centres on Elastagirls work at Devtech, attempting to legalise Supers. Devtech televises Elastagirls heroic deeds, in order to give people perspective, and gain public support.
Unknown to Elastagirl, the villain ScreenSlaver is actually a fabrication of Evelyn Devtech, who hypnotises people through screens. Eventually, Elastagirl gets hypnotised by Evelyn in a scheme to make Supers illegal forever. Evelyns bitterness stems from the belief that her father died because he relied too much on Supers. Supers keep us weak, she says.
Another continuing theme in The Incredibles 2 is a distrust of wealthy tech companies that offer seductive, expedient solutions. Its no coincidence that in both films tech companies offer the Parr family jobs that, firstly, alleviate the familys financial troubles and secondly, validate their superpowers. In The Incredibles Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, gets a well-paying job with Syndrome, a tech giant who uses Mr. Incredibles powers to eliminate Supers. In The Incredibles 2 Helen Parr, aka Elastagirl, accepts a well-paying job from Devtech, a multi-billion dollar telecommunications company, whose co-owner Evelyn Devtech uses Elastagirls Super-status to eliminate Supers.
One way that The Incredibles 2 tries to avoid excessively resembling the first film is by
switching Bobs and Helens domestic roles. Hilariously, Mr. Incredible discovers the joys and hardships of being a stay-at-home dad. They keep changing math! he proclaims, struggling with Dashs homework. He tries to repair Violets teenage love-life, only to make it much worse.
Jack-Jack, the baby, starts exhibiting his powersmultiplying, walking through solid objects, shooting lasers out of his eyes, turning into a fire-demon, floating through different dimensions-to name a few. Undoubtedly, Jack-Jack is the star of the film, the most challenging baby one could possibly imagine. Mr. Incredible is saved from self-destructing by none other than Edna Mode. Edna is the only person who seems to understand Jack-Jack, claiming that, He is bright and I am stimulating. We are perfect for each other, and she invents a super-suit that contains his powers.
The film features a cast of new superheroes with powers ranging from deadly acid reflux and piercing screams, to creating voids that allow objects to appear and disappear in space. With the addition of superheroes comes a great deal of Super-on-Super combat. After Evelyn Devtech uses hypnosis-goggles to control everyone but the children, its up to Dash, Violet, and Jack-Jack to save the day. They free their parents from hypnosis, and finally all of the Supers who band together to stop an enormous ship from crashing into Metrocity.
The Incredibles save the day, and the legal status of superheroes is restored. But the movie does not end on an unambiguously happy note. As Evelyn is arrested, Violet adds, First of all, shes rich and shell probably only get a slap on the wrist.

Fashion  with a conscience
There is greater need now in the world of fashion to redefine sustainability and to bring solutions that are relevant to the issues that the global fashion industry is facing. The Responsible Fashion Movement was set up in 2017 to do just that. It first defined the current need by identifying eight impact areas that could be the base from where the solutions will flow.
These impact areas will be the pillars of development or movement. One of the key objectives defined was that Knowledge will be converted into Action, so that through the action the solutions are visible. The Summit took place on July 4 at Shangri-la Hotel, Colombo.
The focus of the first summit broadly was the societal impact and the environmental impact, with a theme A New Normal. This was the step the industry wanted to take in Sri Lanka and show it as the shining light in region by leading this inclusive movement for the bigger good of the environment.
This is a defining Movement for Sri Lanka, Asia and Rest of the world, as our mandate for impact is unique and is very relevant to the global issues that the fashion supply chain is facing, and Sri Lanka is perfectly placed to take the lead in the region, says Ajai Vir Singh, Founder of The Responsible Fashion Movement.
After the successful first summit, the second Responsible Fashion Summit was framed to push the environmental causes strongly. The of the second summit was Earth Sensitive. The focus shifts to bring awareness and solutions to environmental issues that the global fashion industry is facing.

If you want to catch Falcons RB Devonta Freeman in action, but in a rather unorthodox way, you might throw your attention to the new Escape Plan film.
Freeman will have a small role in the film as an inmate in whatever new dangerous prison Sylvester Stallone and now Dave Bautista will be trying to break out of. The film apparently shot in Atlanta, which might be how Free got involved.

Human-elephant conflict in Anuradhapura
Gigametre-long protective fence to be erected soon
Incidents related to the human-elephant conflict had been on the rise in the Anuradhapura district recently. Investigations had revealed that the prevailing drought had created a scarcity of food and water in jungle areas and hence, elephants had been forced to wander into villages in search of food. According to Anuradhapura Wildlife Conservation Department sources, the most-affected Divisional Secretariat jurisdictions were Medawachchiya, Kebithigollewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Thirappane, Nuwaragampalatha, Horowpothana and Galenbindunuwewa.
Meanwhile, Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, during a meeting on the human-elephant conflict held in Anuradhapura, said the ministry had sufficient funds to find solutions for issues concerning the matter, such as the inadequacy of protective electric fences, scarcity of elephant crackers, insufficient manpower for wildlife conservation activities as well as the lack of infrastructural facilities at national sanctuaries.
He said that Rs. 500 million was already available at the ministry, in addition to a Rs. 900 million fixed deposit. Referring to the electric fences, the minister said that in addition to the current 4-Gigametre (Gm)-long fence, steps would be taken to erect an additional protective fence spanning 1 Gm.
Field Marshal Fonseka said there would be a new approach to address the issue with villagers of the affected areas; Wildlife Conservation officials and 3,000 civil security guards attached to the department would participate in a human-elephant conflict prevention programme soon.
He said that he was determined to put an end to the issue, which had affected the country for nearly 70 years.
A Wildlife Conservation Department spokesman said the new concept would target to erect reinforced electric fences around villages or village clusters in contrast to the previous system, which only focused on erecting protective fences around forest reservations and jungle belts.
Initiated in the Galgamuwa Divisional Secretariat division in Kurunegala as a pilot project, the programme had proven to be successful. The system is yet to be introduced to the Anuradhapura district. Plans are underway to construct the new electric fence system in the Nekatunawewa, Kahatagollewa, Ataweeragollewa, Kattamurichchana and Nayakapuwewa areas, where wild elephant invasions occur regularly.
According to Wildlife Conservation Department sources, the scarcity of elephant crackers had been a setback in driving away invading jumbos. Although around 10,000 crackers are required as a monthly quota, only half the number is currently issued.
Meanwhile, a proposal to establish a Weta Samithiya (fence society) in the affected areas, to overlook matters related to electric fences, is yet to be approved.

Houston biopic director hints at death conspiracy
Filmmaker Kevin Macdonald has insisted Whitney Houston's death was more mysterious than initially reported.
The legendary singer passed away at the age of 48 after she was found unconscious in a bathtub. The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office listed her death as an "accident" caused by drowning and the "effects of atherosclerotic heart disease and cocaine use," while toxicology results discovered substances including Benadryl and Xanax in her system.
However, Macdonald, whose documentary Whitney has been met with rave reviews so far, uncovered some unusual information regarding the circumstances surrounding her death.
"There was discussion about the death, which was so mysterious," the Scottish filmmaker explained in an interview with NME. "Mary Jones, her assistant, told me that she thought there might have been someone else in the room when Whitney died, because there was so much water on the floor, but the taps in the bath were off. The taps had been on for the bath to overflow, but who switched them off"
Macdonald recalled speaking to "various dodgy individuals" who were present in the lead up to the tragedy, but ultimately decided to omit the footage to keep in line with the movie's overall themes.
"It felt like a very long 15 minutes at the end of the film. It felt like that wasnt what the film was about," he insisted. "I think the film became about the family."
Earlier this year, Houston's ex-husband of 14 years Bobby Brown expressed cynicism regarding the coroner's reports, and was adamant that drugs were not to blame for the Grammy Award winners death.
"I don't think (Whitney) died from drugs," he told Rolling Stone.
"She was really working hard on herself to try to be a sober person."
The couple's daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown also died in similar circumstances at the age of 22, when she was found face down in a bath tub in July 2015.

How ripe should bananas be before they are eaten
A massive debate is raging on social media over this seemingly ordinary question: how ripe should bananas be before they are eaten
Some refuse to eat the tropical yellow fruit if there is even hint of green showing through, while anyone who has binned a bruised banana will attest that there is such thing as being too ripe.
A widely-shared Instagram snap from the fitness meals account has asked its 2.3 million followers what is the ideal level of ripeness for a banana.
Using a 1to15 scale, with 1 being the most underripe and 15 being the most ripe, users were asked to rate their perfect banana.
As ever, social media is proving to have a wide range of opinions on the matter as thousands of commentators left their responses.
The majority of banana-lovers said they would opt for numbers 8 through 10 from the bunch, indicating that green skin was a big no-no.
Others plumped for numbers 6 and 7 showing that they were not scared off by a younger banana, while more adventurous respondents said they were likely to go for a brown and squishy number 11.
Of course there were some who thought that number two, almost entirely green, was the way to go.
Food expert Rhiannon Lambert, choosing a banana with a specific ripeness could be beneficial to those suffering from diabetes or digestion trouble.
Bananas are a fruit that may be limited in a diet prescribed to those who suffer with diabetes due to the high content of free sugars, however, that is at the discretion of the health professional, she told the Daily Mail.
Research suggests that in under-ripe bananas, starch constitutes 80-90 per cent of the carbohydrate content, which, as the banana ripens, changes into free sugars. Therefore, people who suffer with diabetes are advised to eat bananas that are not overly ripe as not to spike their blood sugar too much. When the resistant starch changes to simple sugar, a banana ripens, and studies have suggested that more ripe (yellow) bananas are easier to digest for the average person. The higher glycemic index of ripe bananas shows that they are digested more quickly. Think of a tennis player snacking on a banana for a burst of energy. However, if you love bananas, enjoy them how they you think they taste best. You could eat unripened bananas or ripened bananas and still reap the benefits of this nutritious fruit. The only difference is that for individuals with Type 2 Diabetes.

Adventure seekers have for long searched for the mysterious city of Atlantis first written about by ancient Greek philosopher Plato.
Some claim it was a real place and was once the ruling power of the world before a natural disaster sank the entire island into the sea.
Conspiracy theorists believe they could have finally found it, using Google Earth.
The giant structure that is believed to have been found at the bottom of the ocean, just west of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean is estimated to be between a massive 3.5 miles to 11 miles across.
Conspiracy theorists are speculating it is an ancient sunken city, an UFO, or an alien base. The discovery was made by Marcelo Igazusta, an Argentinian, who posted a video on YouTube.
According to Express.co.uk reports, commentary in the clip described it has being an intense light in the Pacific Ocean.
Speaking to the publication, alien conspiracist theorist Scott C Waring said that it is a perfect pyramid that measures over 8.5 miles across one side of its base. Calling it a monumental discovery, he added it could be an ancient civilisation.
He added that even if it is not a UFO that landed in the ocean, it still was a monumental discovery.
A 8.5 mile pyramid...biggest the world has ever known, and its right off of Mexico, near the ancient Mayan and Aztec pyramids, he said.

Kim Sei-young wins Thornberry crown in historic style
Los Angeles, Monday: South Korean Kim Sei-young smashed the LPGA 72-hole scoring record Sunday, winning the Thornberry Creek LPGA Classic with a stunning 31-under par total.
Kim, 24-under to start the day, fired a final-round seven-under par 65 on the par-72 Thornberry course in Oneida, Wisconsin.
Her 31-under total of 257 broke the LPGA's 72-hole scoring record in relation to par of 27-under, first set by Swedish great Annika Sorenstam in 2001 and matched by Kim herself at the 2016 Founders Cup in Phoenix.
She also broke the record for fewest strokes over 72 holes of 258, achieved by Karen Stupples in 2004 and matched by Angela Stanford and Park Hee-Young in 2013.
"I really feel, like, unreal," Kim said. "I never thought about shooting, like, 31-under. I really feel incredible."
But the 25-year-old knew setting out on Sunday that she was within striking distance of the record, giving herself a goal of playing the final round without a bogey.
"I was feeling a little bit of different than the third round because a little bit of pressure," Kim admitted. "I thought about how do you handle nerves today. Then I set my goals, just kept relaxed -- except the last three holes I couldn't control the nerves because it was almost done, but I finished really good."
Kim's only blemish all week was a double bogey at the par-three 17th on Friday.  AFP

Lanka sends mens team to win boys rugby sevens in Paris
The Sri Lanka national mens sevens rugby team, who played under the name of Lanka Lions won the Cup championship beating Bagneux, a French club side by 50 points to nil competing in the Boys open category for clubs at the Paris World Games played on July 7 and 8.
The team that got approval from Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha as the national Sri Lanka side represented the tournament as Lanka Lions.
Lanka Lions captained by national skipper Sudarshana Muthuthanthri won all their three games played in Group A beating Leopards Sevens (a club team from the Democratic Republic of Congo) 41-10, Ocean Sevens Bleu (a club team from France) 33-12 and Club HEC (a club team from France) 25-0.
In the Cup semifinals Lanka Lions beat Oceans Seven Rouge (a club team from France) 28-7.
In the final Lanka Lions thrashed the French club team Bagneux 50-0.
The Daily News spoke to some of the rugby stalwarts regarding the victory achieved by Lanka Lions and this is what they had to say:
Ex-S.Thomas College Mount Lavinia rugby captain and under 18 coach, CR & FC rugby captain, Sri Lanka national player and team manager, SLRFU council member and CR & FC president Christopher Jordash said: First and foremost we need to emphasize on the sevens circuit and games, tournaments that we should compete to get exposure before the Asian Games. Since Sri Lanka has not been invited to some key tournaments because of their low rankings, it seems difficult to take part in the sevens circuit or get invited. The last event was the Commonwealth Games where we came 15th out of 16 teams.
If Sri Lanka is concentrating on the Sevens circuit, they need more competing tournaments or we will not get the desired results in the Asian Games. Why Sri Lanka Rugby (SLR) went ahead with a low quality tour like this and wasted funds not gaining proper exposure by not competing with any national sides but a Boys open club tournament in the Paris World Cup is no achievement.
This is serious mistake on the part of the officials who went ahead with such a tournament. The rugby fraternity will needs to know the truth behind this Lanka Lions tour.
Former Sri Lanka double international (Rugby and Basketball), Police SC rugby captain and former Western Province Rugby Football Union president (WPRFU), ex DIG Hafeez Marso said: By taking part in this kind of lower grade club Paris World Games rugby 7s rugby tournament like the Boys Open, we have dropped our quality of rugby immensely. It will have a negative impact on the upcoming Asian Games in Jakarta. When getting close to a really competitive rugby tournament like in the Asian Games we must compete with high quality opponents for us to be more competitive.

Modi lauds Indian gymnast for first gold in world event
New Delhi, Monday: Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the tributes Monday for woman gymnast Dipa Karmakar who bagged India's first ever gold medal in a global gymnastic event in Turkey.
Karmakar, who participated in her first international competition since narrowly missing an Olympic medal in 2016, won the women's vault at the FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Challenge Cup in Mersin on Sunday.
The 24-year-old had recovered from a career-threatening knee injury suffered last year as her average score of 14.150 edged out Indonesia's Rifda Irfanaluthfi (13.400).
"More than the gold, what was important for me was to perform at the optimum level. I am happy I could do that considering the fact at the beginning of the year, I was hobbling back to fitness," Karmakar was quoted as saying by the Hindustan Times newspaper.
"Getting back into top gear makes me believe that my knee has healed completely and I should now be able to go all out at the Asian Games," she added.
The Asian Games take place in Indonesia from August 18 to September 2.Modi took to Twitter to congratulate the Indian athlete who missed the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year due to her injury.
"India is proud of @DipaKarmakar!... This win is a prime example of her tenacity and never-say-die attitude," said Modi.
Sports minister Rajyavardhan Rathore, an Indian politician and a former professional shooter who won silver in the 2004 Olympics, also praised the champion gymnast.
"#DipaKarmakar is the stuff champions are made of! After battling an injury for the past 2 yrs, she makes a heroic comeback by clinching her first in the Gymnastics World Challenge Cup in Turkey! Many Congratulations to her for making proud!," Rathore wrote on Twitter. Karmakar though is still some distance away from the dangerous "Produnova Vault" that got her bronze in the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland.
Named after Russian gymnast Yelena Produnova, the "Vault of Death" as it is nicknamed was first introduced in 1999, but is so dangerous some want it banned.  AFP

Negotiations on for lease of Mattala Airport
Aviation industry officials of India and Sri Lanka are continuing their discussions on forming a joint venture to develop the Mattala International airport.
Executive Director, Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Limited (AASL), Johanne Jayaratne said the current discussions are focused on aircraft movements and air space movements in Sri Lanka.
He added that the revival plan of the airport would be based on a lease agreement with India; however, aircraft movements and the air space use would be totally controlled by Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the AASL would have a minimum of 30 to 40% controlling share of the airport. The lease agreement too is expected to be for a period of 30 years, he said. Mattala airport recorded 176 non-scheduled international operations and 440 non-scheduled domestic flights in 2017.
Up to April this year, there were 42 International non-scheduled flight operations and 56 non scheduled domestic flights to Mattala. Subsequent to the opening of the Mattala International airport, Sri Lanka has earned additional foreign exchange of Rs. 90 million a month through over flying charges.
This increase cannot be purely attributed or qualified as a direct result of the new airport. Jayaratne said the airport was built with the expectation of attracting A-380 Airbuses to Sri Lanka.
When the Mattala Airport planning was in progress it was believed that it could be a commercially viable project. But today the aviation dynamics have changed a lot and the A-380 aircraft option is not viable as they are being overshadowed by A320 Neos and similar aircraft with greater endurance but smaller in size. They do not need a CODE F (size of A-380 runway) runway to land.Meanwhile Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last week said that government is making elaborate plans to re-activate the Mattala International airport and planning to attract air passengers to use it commonly.
Prime Minister Wickramasinghe speaking at a youth forum in Moneragala last Saturday said that the airport can be made an attractive place for tourists especially for passengers from neighboring India which in turn will help the economic revival of the entire Southern Province.
He said though Sri Lanka has built an airport in Mattala with Chinese funds which are yet to be settled would add a huge burden to the economy. In addition there are no aircraft moments for the airport to bring in revenue.
At present profits made from Katunayake airport is being used to pay off loans taken for Mattala. The Dubai-based budget airline, Fly Dubai which was operating a weekly flight to Mattala suspended their operations last month. The Prime Minister said, Sri Lanka and India will form a joint venture to run the Mattala international airport and this would be done in a few months.

Next album will be her last
Sheryl Crow will release her final album next year. The If It Makes You Happy hitmaker explains she is keen to continue releasing music, but she doesn't feel full-length albums from artists like her will be in demand much longer.
Her final record will feature collaborations with Stevie Nicks, Keith Richards, Joe Walsh, Don Henley, and late country singer Johnny Cash.
"I've got this record in the can that's going to be coming out next year," she tells podcast Kyle Meredith With... "It's a very collaborative record with people I've asked to collaborate with me, people I've loved and have worked with and who have been heroes of mine forever."
"Albums as an art form are a bit of a dying art form. People are more interested in singles," she adds.
"I've made the decision in my head that the record that comes out next year will be my last full album. I'll just start putting songs out... to put out really pertinent songs that feel immediate."

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, addressing the media after paying his final respects to former Parliamentarian V. K. Indika at his house in Punchihenayagama, Ambalantota, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had recently requested him to speak on the allegations made against him by the New York Times.
He said the Prime Minister had pledged to produce Arjun Mahendran at Parliament, but it had not been done thus far, adding that therefore, he would not make a statement until Prime Minister Wickremesinghe held true to his promise.Commenting on the LTTE commemoration in the North, Rajapaksa said that it was as if the North was a separate state on its own and as such, citizens could carry out any act they wished.
The commemoration itself was not an issue for the present regime, he said, adding that if a similar event were to occur in the South, however, those persons would be brought to book immediately.

OMPs success depends on Political will
The success of the Office on Missing Persons (OMP) will depend on political will, Office of Missing Persons Chairman Saliya Peiris said.
Peiris was addressing a media workshop for Parliament journalists organized by the Internews yesterday in Colombo.
He said the OMP has decided to establish 12 provincial offices, including five in the North and three in the East.
He said the provincial offices are to expedite the investigations. Observing that there is still no definite or official figure on disappeared/missing persons in Sri Lanka, he said it could be the highest in South Asia.
We believe that there should be a right to remember those who have been disappeared, and our office (OMP) will be taking steps to ensure this in the future, he noted.
We have received over 13,000 files from the former National Integration Ministry.
The files were handed over to the Ministry by various Grama Niladhari officers following a Ministry announcement to the public to submit instances of missing or disappeared persons. We are now going through these cases. Some may overlap with the cases we have already received through our own investigations, the OMP Chairman said.
Peiris said tracing missing or disappeared persons is a long-erm process.
