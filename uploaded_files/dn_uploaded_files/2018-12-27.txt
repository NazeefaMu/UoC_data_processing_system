Ballot battles in the offing!
The swearing in of the Cabinet of ministers by President Maithripala Sirisena last Thursday signalled a new phase in the countrys government with the United National Front (UNF) now set to govern until the next national elections which are due in early 2020.
This also marked the exit of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) from governance for the first time since January 2015 when the National Unity government was formed in the aftermath of the presidential election.
The composition of the Cabinet was itself a contentious issue, resulting in the ministers taking oaths being delayed by a few days. At stake were a few disputed portfolios, the number of Cabinet ministers and the President Sirisenas own firmly held views on the formation of the new Cabinet.
There was much debate in the public domain- and indeed within the United National Party (UNP)- as to whether former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake should be re-appointed to the Cabinet. That was because Karunanayake was implicated in the Central Bank bond scam.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the issue has made public its findings and they do not reflect well on Karunanayake. Following the revelation that the rent for his apartment was paid for by those with links to the scam, Karunanayake was forced to step down as a minister in August 2017.
However, Karunanayake was pressing his claims to be re-appointed as Finance Minister. Some within the UNP were of the opinion that if his request was acceded to, it would tarnish the partys image and negate the momentum generated by recent events which once again brought together pro-democracy forces who rallied around Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Transparency and good governance
Among them were party stalwarts who wanted Karunanayake kept out of the Cabinet altogether, arguing that this would send a powerful message to the public that the UNP was mindful of its obligations to transparency and good governance. However, this had to be weighed against Karunanayakes services to the party during the recent constitutional crisis.
Eventually, a compromise of sorts was reached. Karunanayake was sworn in as Minister of Power, Energy and Enterprise Development. Predictably, the moves have led to some criticism, but Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has had to deal with competing and conflicting demands in making this decision.
Another former minister who generated much interest was Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka. Fonseka was a minister in the previous coalition government Cabinet and would have naturally expected to be included in the new government. However, President Sirisena has refused his appointment to the Cabinet.
Fonseka, as he is wont to do, had been quite critical of President Sirisena during the constitutional crisis. Whether this was the sole reason for the Presidents decision is now a moot point. The UNF failed in its attempts to convince the President to include Fonseka and he was not among the ministers sworn in last Thursday.
It was not only to Fonseka that President Sirisena objected to. Following the constitutional crisis, three stalwarts from the UPFA- Vijith Wijeyamuni Soysa, Lakshman Seneviratne and Indika Bandaranayake- crossed over to the government although they maintain that they have not joined the UNP. The UNF government expected them to be granted ministerial appointments.
That was also not to be. President Sirisena was firm in his decision not to sanction that. Earlier this week, addressing members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) he re-iterated his position, stating that he would not allow any parliamentarians crossing over from the party to the government to hold office in the UNF government.
No longer a national government
Another issue that was in dispute was the number of ministers that could be allowed. This had to be curtailed because the government was no longer a national government of two or more political parties, with the withdrawal of the UPFA.
This was because of changes brought about by the 19th Amendment. Article 46(1) of the Constitution, as amended by the 19th Amendment, states that The total number of Ministers of the Cabinet of Ministers shall not exceed thirty and Ministers who are not members of the Cabinet of Ministers and Deputy Ministers shall not, in the aggregate exceed forty.
In the lead up to the formation of the new Cabinet following the constitutional crisis, there was some discussion as to whether the UNF should include the lone member who contested from the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC), Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana who represents the Batticaloa district to form a nominal national government. This would have allowed the government to expand the Cabinet.
That would have been in accordance with Article 46(4) of the Constitution, as amended by the 19th Amendment, which states that, Where the recognized political party or the independent group which obtains highest number of seats in Parliament forms a National Government, the number of Ministers in the Cabinet of Ministers, the number of Ministers who are not Cabinet of Ministers and the number of Deputy Ministers shall be determined by Parliament.
For these purposes, Article 46(5) defines a national government as a government formed by the recognised political party or the independent group which obtains the highest number of seats in Parliament together with the other recognized political parties or the independent groups.
Including the SLMC by co-opting Moulana would technically come under this provision without any ambiguity. However, the UNP hierarchy realised that the public was well aware that other members of the SLMC contested under the UNF banner at the 2015 elections. As such, any moves to engage in constitutional sleight of hand for the purpose of increasing the Cabinet would be met with derision by the electorate. Therefore, that strategy was not adopted.
Still, the number of Cabinet ministers remains an issue under scrutiny. Although Article 46(1) of the Constitution specifies the number of Cabinet ministers to be thirty, it does not specify whether this is inclusive of, or in addition to, the President and the Prime Minister who are also members of the Cabinet by virtue of the respective offices they hold.
If the provision is interpreted to mean that the Cabinet could consist of thirty ministers in addition to the President and the Prime Minister, it would allow the UNF to accommodate two more ministers and this is under active consideration at present. The opinion of the Attorney General is to be sought in this regard.
The developments noted above indicate that, despite the resolution of the constitutional crisis in a relatively amicable manner, still there are significant differences of opinion between President Sirisena and his UNF government. This suggests that there is potential for dissension within the Executive and the Legislature in governing the country until the next elections.
Next national elections
President Sirisena also indicated, while addressing SLFP stalwarts recently that the party will be contesting in alliance with the Mahinda Rajapaksa led Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) at the next national elections. It is clear that, at least as far as President Sirisena is concerned, having forsaken his alliance with the UNP, he has thrown in his lot firmly with the SLPP.
Thus, the battle lines for the next national election have become clearer. Rather than being a three-way battle between the UNP, SLFP and the SLPP, it is now likely to be a two-way contest between the UNF and the SLFP-SLPP alliance with of course the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) tapping in to their share of the vote. It would no doubt be a fascinating tussle, especially in light of the recent political turmoil the country witnessed.

## Title: The bus fare revision

The bus fare revision
Fuel prices fluctuate wildly in the world market from time to time. Right now, prices hover in the US$ 42-50 per barrel range, depending on the grade. This is a huge reduction from the US$ 80-100 witnessed a few months ago. It is only right that the Government should pass on that benefit to the consumer, already burdened by the high cost of living. Fuel prices in Sri Lanka have now come down by almost Rs.30 per litre across all varieties  even the 51-day interim, if illegal, Government reduced fuel prices twice and one of the first actions of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after being re-appointed was reducing fuel prices by Rs.10.
A curious phenomenon perhaps witnessed only in this country is that whenever fuel prices go up even by Rs.5, bus fares tend to be increased by 10-15 percent. Three wheeler fares, school van fares and even the prices of bakery goods go up by an equal margin. However, there is great reluctance by these self-same parties to lower the prices when the fuel prices decrease by a considerable margin, as has happened now.
During the 51-day regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa, private bus fares were reduced by just 2 percent. This was not implemented practically at all, as a Rs.100 fare would have been reduced by just Rs.2. And we know very well that private bus conductors, if not SLTB conductors, conveniently forget the balance in such instances. The new fares were practically non-existent.
Even when fuel prices have been reduced by almost Rs.30 in just a few months, private bus fares have now been reduced by only 4 percent. The four percent reduction is not commensurate with the fuel price reduction at all. We commend the efforts of new Transport Minister Arjuna Ranatunga in this direction, but it seems that the private bus organisations have won again, much to the detriment of passengers.
There is no reason why at least the minimum fare cannot be restored to Rs.10, which is convenient for both passengers and crew. Most passengers tend to give Rs.15 or even Rs.20 to the conductor as Rs.2 coins are not readily available all the time, but it is very rarely that a conductor will give the balance of Rs.3 or 8 as the case may be. Passe Dennam (I will give later) is the common refrain, but most commuters dont bother to ask again, knowing the propensity of private bus conductors to verbally abuse passengers. No wonder that private bus organisations do not want to decrease the minimum fare. Moreover, private buses never display the revised fares inside the buses, rendering the passengers helpless as they cannot point out the correct fares.
That is just one part of the story. Private bus drivers are well known for dangerous driving that puts the lives of passenger at risk. In fact, recklessly driven private buses are responsible for many fatal accidents. They are also known to pack passengers like sardines, violate all road rules, never issue tickets and wear unkempt clothes. Above all, many private buses run on kerosene, which is much cheaper than diesel. Thus even an increase of diesel prices does not affect them. Police try to crack down buses running on kerosene, but they cannot detect every one of them.
The next time that private bus organisations demand a fare increase for whatever reason, the Government should stick to its guns and maintain the stance that it cannot be granted unless there is a substantial improvement in these aspects. Many experts have suggested the formation of professionally run private bus consortiums as in Singapore, which will be able to offer a much better level of service.
Three-wheeler associations have also seemingly agreed to reduce the fare of the first kilometre by Rs. 10 - from Rs.60 to Rs. 50. From midnight on Wednesday, charges for the first kilometre would be Rs.50. But as far as we remember this is exactly what they said when the 51-day government also reduced fuel prices. This is indeed laughable, because the two leading ride sharing companies in the country charged just Rs.30-35 per kilometres for tuk-tuks even when fuel prices were at their peak. Besides, most three wheeler drivers say their meter is broken and fleece the customers. The authorities should install a hotline to entertain complaints regarding three wheelers. The display of driver/owner information on the back of seat must also be made mandatory. The time has indeed come to phase out three wheelers by 2030 or so  they dont gel with our image as an upcoming financial and hub of Asia. We need a proper car based taxi service, as found in most countries. School vans too have reduced prices by just three percent, which again is not enough. Parents deserve a bigger break, given that van owners usually charge half the fee even if the schools close for holidays on say, the 5th or 6th of a given month. We need a comprehensive national policy on bus, three wheeler and school van fares so that consumers get more benefits.

Bus fares reduced from today
Bus fares will be reduced by 4 percent from today, but the minimum fare of Rs 12 will not change, Transport Ministry sources said.
The Sri Lanka Private Bus Owners' Association agreed to reduce bus fares by 4 percent following a discussion held on Sunday with Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
The price of a litre of petrol had come down by Rs.24 in the past two months and a litre of diesel by Rs.32.
According to the new bus fare revision, the maximum fare of Rs 965 will come down to Rs 924.
The minimum charge of three wheelers raised due to the fuel price hike to Rs.60 has also been reduced by Rs.10 to Rs. 50 in the light of fuel price revisions. It has also been agreed to reduce school vehicle fares by 3 percent.
The government has taken steps to provide these concessions to the public after discussions with public transport organisations.

## Title: CHINAS PRIVATE SECTOR IS UNDER SIEGE

## Date: Thursday, December 27, 2018 - 01:00
CHINAS PRIVATE SECTOR IS UNDER SIEGE
Just a few days ago, China commemorated 40 years of opening up of the economy through reform. President Xi Jinping affirmed the countrys commitment to reform but stressed that the Communist Partys dominance and leadership has been the key to Chinas economic achievements.
In his 90 minutes speech, Xi reiterated his support for strengthening the private sector, promoting innovation, and solving unbalanced development, but he did not provide any details. While these promises aim to boost private sector development, entrepreneurs appear to have significantly soured on their economic outlook and business confidence following recent shifts in government policy, including growing pressure to set up Communist Party cells within private enterprises.
Last year, Chinese authorities requested comprehensive Party building in the private sector, including within foreign companies operating in China. Requiring private companies to set up Party branches or Party cells is not a new practice. Since early 2000, private enterprises with three Communist Party members had to establish a Party cell.
Political power
A Party cell has managerial or governance function and is a way to co-opt the private sector. Recently, the government has begun a new push to set up Party cells in private companies and even in foreign firms and joint ventures, at a time when the political power in China has become more centralized than ever. By 2016, the ratio of the nonstate enterprises that had Party cells had risen to almost 70 percent, a significant increase from just one year prior. Foreign companies in China feel the pinch as well, with an equivalent 70 percent of foreign companies hosting Party cells. Groups like the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce in China have warned their members of Communist Party attempts to strengthen its influence on wholly foreign-owned companies operating in China.
The impact of adding a Party cell goes far beyond an increase in the cost of doing business. It also impacts the corporate structure and management decisions as they grow more opaque with the blurring of lines between the states role and private ownership. In so doing, this policy threatens to reverse Chinas four decades old reform agenda of opening up to private enterprise as an engine of growth.
Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs)
Moreover, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have altered their by-laws to highlight the leadership role of the Communist Party, with the Party advising boards in management decisions. As many of the SOEs are listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, these moves raise serious corporate governance questions. Some argue that the companies will ignore shareholders interests in favour of aligning with Party policy and interest.
These governance changes highlight the more aggressive stance that the Chinese state wants to take in dominating every aspect of the society and economy, while exposing the contradictions in the Chinese leaderships claim to let the market forces play a greater role.
In fact, entrepreneurs feel very insecure about their ownership and control over their businesses and companies. For instance, Alibabas Jack Ma once said that if the government wants to take over Alipay (value at $150 billion), he will gift it to the state without complaint. Tech startups are increasingly encouraged to sell shares to government bodies so that government-designated representatives can sit on the board to participate in management and operating decisions.
Doing business in China will remain a challenge as the country continues to be ruled by the party rather than by the rule of law, with the state omnipresent in the board rooms of private companies. The government can have more private sector forums like the one in November chaired by Xi to try to revive the confidence of the private sector. But rhetoric alone is not sufficient; the real challenge is whether the government can promote the rule of law, respect private ownership, and allow space for a free marketplace of ideas to flourish.

Even voters are narrow-minded
Writing a letter to the Citizens Mail one D. Weeratunge from Navinna has said that our politicians are narrow-minded. We must remember that even voters are also narrow-minded.
That is why politicians have been too selfish and fraudulent.
That is why the country is not developed. The problem of the country is because of the fact that voters are narrow-minded they act as politicians wish. They participate in thousands to the rallies of politicians, destroying their money and valuable time which can be used for some fruitful purpose. They also do commit many crimes because of their politicians and politics. They do fight with others who are members of other political parties.
Their behaviour and actions are showing that they are too narrow-minded.
Voters must know what democracy is. But they do not know it. Because of the fact that voters are too ignorant politicians have been able to do as they wish.

Blessings to one and all this special season for giving... especially those who believe in and live by our Union code.
Its a marvel in itself and truly the phenomenon of Christmas that binds the world.
All clubs take a good break ...for its time for rehab and contemplating.
Coaches can afford some grey matter indulgence.... possibly even some lateral fixing..
Good time for options and understanding real pressure.
Sean Wijeysinghe is away and Fazil back under the kosh despite their 30 game winning streak.
Remarkable phenomenon this ..hard to beat ..let alone match.
Martis and Lakala need some specifics in place to stamp their brand of rugby.
CR and Nilufers have had some horrible luck... which is tough to counter in the middle...round 2 should free their running game and plenty for Tarinda Ratwatte to glide through... almost the Midas touch this year...... much to the dismay of opposition plans to nail him.
Nawaz and Rodda really shaping the police boys for some inspired rugby next year. They have a decent balance and potential to upset form.
What Navy coach Motilal could not do.....was beat defending champions Kandy...despite leading to the wire.
Just good instincts lacking. Thats the magic champions carry.
Even on a mundane home grubby days....they finish better.
Tough pill to neck it down and Havelocks running out of petrol...and patience.
Ronny is best under pressure and lateral ability his fall back.
CH certainly the glam team by fault on paper.
Results quiz that fact...names got little to offer...unless teamthe sprint so much a vital stretch to counter thinking.
CH has been my island home...and a family drama that is still beyond convention.
If they find their stripes and finishing, the league is open ...and between challenges so needed to spice up and encourage waffles of fresh tropical island rugby.
Their passion will now be tested. Their passion exploring the ocean of options... Big wins with domestic weekends beyond seal and cement Kandy ...as the top.
The change is harsh and massive ....some therapy to survive the super league format will separate contenders...in the 2 games they play in 2019.
Equally horrified by news of the national U19 skipper compromising everything.
His behaviour needs careful scrutiny and practical steps to educate and penance.....he must be singled out for discipline and punishment.
The union is fundamental, decide quickly and eradicate the source.
Apart from losing ...we have horrid humiliation of looking unprofessional as a stakeholder of Asian rugby.
I hope action is swift and surgical.
The fear of not setting a proper example on and off the field ...absolutely fundamental to all our futures.
That the game is in need of solid protection ...so that players, fans and administration can execute their tasks, devoid of fear and recriminations.
Sri Lanka rugby have huge responsibility to stamp out unacceptable behaviour at all levels.
The future must shine, shine, shine.
Blessings to all rugby hearts once again and strength to our guiding executive of officials to ensure fair play and natural justice at all times.
That is the axis on which we rotate and planet rugby demands nothing short of maximum
Enjoy the holidays ...absorb some international rugby, catch up with Setanta replays at leisure.

Indias longest road-rail bridge opens
INDIA: India on Tuesday opened its longest rail-road bridge in a poor northeastern state as part of efforts to boost defences on its sensitive border with China.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi drove an inaugural cavalcade along the 4.9 kilometre (three mile) long Bogibeel bridge over the Brahmaputra river to inaugurate the project in Assam state which has taken nearly two decades and $800 million to complete.
The bridge, near the city of Dibrugarh, will enable the military to speed up the dispatch of forces to neighbouring Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China.
With the opening of the bridge, the rail journey from Dibrugarh to the Arunachal Pradesh capital Itanagar has been cut by 750 kilometres. India lost territory in Arunachal Pradesh in a 1962 war with China.
The bridge has been designed to bear the weight of Indias heaviest 60 tonne battle tanks and so that fighter jets can land on it.
India opened its longest bridge, the 9.1km Dhola-Sadiya bridge, in 2017 to connect Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, also to boost tactical defences.
Construction of the Bogibeel bridge was agreed by the government as part of a 1985 agreement to end years of deadly agitation by Assamese nationalist groups.

Invasive plants spoil major tanks
Invasive aquatic plants have spread in water sources destroying agriculture and fish varieties.
The National Aquatic Development Authority (NAQDA) sources said invasive aquatic plants such as Najas marina, Japan jabara, Salvinea, Hydrilla and algae such as microcytic are spreading rapidly in water sources and making them poisonous for aquatic species.
The invasive plants have invaded even major tanks such as Mahakanadarawa, Mahawilachchiya, Angamuwa and Abayawewa in Anuradhapura and major tanks in Kurunegala, Hambantota, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee.
A NAQDA spokesman said freshwater fish production has dropped significantly as a result.
The NAQDA targets to produce 157,000 MT of fresh water fish in 2020 and 352,000 MT by 2025. But with the invasive plants in water sources, that target seems unrealistic.
Annual freshwater fish production can be increased by additional 30,000 MT and the rural economy will strengthen by Rs. 6,000 million initially if relevant authorities take steps to remove the invasive plants from water sources.
The NAQDA will purchase three high-tech aquatic weed removal machines at a cost of Rs. 175 million very soon, its sources said.
The Irrigation Department has already purchased such a machine for Rs. 60 million.

Kohli, Pujara make Australia toil after impressive Agarwal debut
Melbourne, Wednesday: Powerhouse Indian pair Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kolhi built on an impressive 76 from debutant Mayank Agarwal to pile pain on Australia in the crunch third Test Wednesday.
On a docile, batsman-friendly Melbourne Cricket Ground wicket, India ground their way to 215 for two at stumps on day one with the rock-like Pujara not out 68 and superstar Kohli unbeaten on 47 as the bowlers toiled in hot conditions for little reward.
Pat Cummins was the pick of the attack, taking two for 40.
India came into the Boxing Day clash with a new pair of inexperienced openers after the misfiring Murali Vijay and KL Rahul were axed, suggesting a hint of panic as Kohlis men look to win their first ever series in Australia.
But the exciting Agarwal rose to the challenge in front of 73,500 fans after India won an important toss and opted to bat on a pitch that is expected to deteriorate as the match wears on.
He stroked 76 and was looking impregnable before Cummins had him caught behind by Tim Paine as he gloved the last ball before tea down the legside.
It brought Kohli to the crease to a huge roar from the large Indian contingent at the MCG and he set about building an unbroken 92-run partnership with the ever-reliable Pujara.
The four-Test series is tied 1-1 after India won the opening clash in Adelaide by 31 runs and Australia drew level with a 146-run victory in Perth, making Melbourne a crunch encounter.
Agarwal, who has been in fine domestic form, scored his first Test runs with a three through the covers off Josh Hazlewood and he had plundered 17 before the more cagey Hanuma Vihari, promoted to open from number six in Perth, troubled the scorers.
After two lively pitches in Adelaide and Perth produced results, the track in Melbourne was not bowler-friendly and skipper Paine brought on spinner Nathan Lyon in only the seventh over to see if he could weave some magic.
But it was Cummins who got the breakthrough.
Vihari had already taken a nasty blow on the helmet in the 12th over, with the physio needed to check he was okay.
The right-hander continued but when he tried to avoid another brutal Cummins bouncer the ball pinged off his glove.
Aaron Finch took an easy catch in the slips and he was gone for eight.
All-rounder Mitch Marsh was then brought into the attack only to be met with boos from a section of the crowd, having been recalled in place of local boy Peter Handscomb.
But Agarwal was unflappable and glided to his maiden Test 50 off 95 balls by effortlessly drilling a Lyon delivery past the non-striker for four.
His 76 is the highest by an Indian opener so far this series.
At the other end the patient Pujara deployed his usual blocking technique, picking off runs from loose balls.
He rarely looked threatened although he got an inside edge on 33 that just failed to carry to Usman Khawaja at gully before bringing up his 21st Test 50 from 152 balls.
Kohli quickly got into a rhythm when he arrived at the crease, accelerating the run rate as he rattled off a string of boundaries, with the signs ominous for Australia going into day two.
Pujara scored a century in Adelaide and Kohli matched the feat in Perth. AFP

Lanka votes in favour of death penalty moratorium at UNGA
Sri Lanka voted in favour of a resolution on the Moratorium on the use of the death penalty during the 73rd United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) plenary sessions last week.
The UNGA adopted the draft resolution on December 17 by a recorded vote of 121 in favour to 35 against, with 32 abstentions. This resolution was proposed by Brazil on behalf of an Inter-Regional Task Force of member states and co-sponsored by 83 states.
The UN in a statement said that it called on all States to respect international standards on the rights of those facing the death penalty and ensure that the practice is not applied on the basis of discriminatory laws or as a result of discriminatory or arbitrary application of the law.
A fresh dialogue on the death penalty erupted in Sri Lanka following President Maithripala Sirisenas announcement in July that he was ready to implement the death sentences on the convicted drug dealers, who continue drug trafficking in the country from within prisons. The President subsequently appointed a committee to look into that proposal.
The Presidents announcement met with strong opposition from the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka and other human rights activists.
According to the Amnesty International, 103 out of 193 UN member states have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, and 139 have done so in law or practice. In 2017, executions were reported in 22 UN member states.
Since 2007 the UN General Assembly has adopted, with increased cross-regional support, six resolutions calling on all states that still retain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing this punishment.
The overall number of votes in favour of these resolutions grew from 104 in 2007 to 117 in 2016 the Amnesty International said in a release.
Sri Lanka has not executed the death penalty since 1976.

Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor Report 2018:
Launch of Sinhala and Tamil versions
The Sinhala and Tamil versions of the Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor 2018 - Sri Lanka section was launched by the Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) on December 14, at the Public Library Auditorium in Jaffna. At the event, a documentary themed, Quest for a mine-free land created by the Government Film Unit in collaboration with the SLCBL was screened for the first time in Sri Lanka. The documentary was first screened at the United Nations Office in Geneva on November 30, 2018 during the 17th meeting of the State Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty.
Vidya Abhayagunawardena, Coordinator of the SLCBL and Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor Country Researcher for Sri Lanka, mentioned that the event was historic as it was the first time that Sinhala and Tamil translation of the Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor-2018 report were launched, the first time the documentary, Quest for a mine-free land was being screened in Sri Lanka, and the first time officials of the Anti-personnel Mine Ban Convention, Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor, International Campaign to Ban Landmines and Cluster Munitions Coalition from Geneva were participating in such an event in Sri Lanka in addition to the celebration of the first anniversary of Sri Lanka becoming a State Party to the Mine Ban Treaty(MBT) on December 13 last year.
Abhayagunawardena mentioned that publishing the monitor report in Sinhala and Tamil languages is important in many ways as that will enable the general public of Sri Lanka to read and understand mine-action in their own language. The Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor based in Geneva is the research and monitoring arm of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and Cluster Munitions Coalition which provides the latest information on problems related to landmines, cluster munitions and explosive remnants of war (ERW).
Sri Lanka acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty (MBT), which is also known as the Ottawa Treaty in 2017, the Convention on Cluster Munitions (CCM) in 2018 and ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD) in 2016. Sri Lanka also ratified the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons Protocol (CCW) I to IV in 2004. Sri Lanka has yet to ratify the CCW Protocol V on ERW.
The chief guest of the event, Jaffna District Secretary and Government Agent Nagalingam Vethanayaham thanked the Government of Sri Lanka for acceding to the Mine Ban Treaty last year. He mentioned that, due to mines and ERWs accidents, many people have died or lost their limbs. Even after the war ended, people are still affected by mines and ERWs.
Acceding to the Treaty will make people happier and together while making Sri Lanka a mine-free country by 2020. It is important to be grateful to the Mine Risk Education organisations for their hard work which helped to reduce mine-related accidents in mine-affected areas. Vethanayaham thanked the SLCBL for conducting the first-anniversary event of acceding to the Mine Ban Treaty in Jaffna.
Abhayagunawardena informed the audience that the SLCBL is concerned about implementing of the UN CRPD, the Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions in Sri Lanka. With regard to the UN CRPD, he mentioned that Sri Lanka ratified the convention on February 8, 2016 but relevant authorities are still struggling to develop local regulations in place to implement the convention in the country. He emphasised the importance of implementing local regulations in place without delay. Especially, the importance of maintaining barrier-free transportation, road pavements accessible for wheelchair users and others, and convenient as well as comfortable public transport (buses and trains) and buildings.
He further mentioned that when Sri Lanka declares itself a mine-free country in near future, the entire population of Sri Lanka and foreigners visiting Sri Lanka should benefit from the implementation of the UN CRPD, Mine Ban Treaty and the Convention on Cluster Munitions.
The Landmine and Cluster MunitionMonitor has been updating its reports annually. It covers the ban policy on Anti-personal Mines, Cluster Munitions and Conventional Weapons; Mine action and Support for mine action; causalities (mines and Explosive Relaxants of War -ERW), and Victim assistance and related local regulations and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
According to the latest clearance data, Sri Lanka has yet to be clear around 26 Square kilometre mine and ERW affected lands in the districts of Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Anuradhapura and Ampara. The only mine and ERW affected districts that are cleared so far Batticaloa and Polonnaruwa.
The Sri Lanka Army Humanitarian Demining Unit (SLA HDU), two local organisations (DASH and SHARP) and two international organisations(The Halo Trust and MAG) are engaging in mine and ERW clearance activities in Sri Lanka. Local and international organisations are solely dependent on international funding support. Currently, local and international demining operators are facing severe funding constraints.
The Sri Lankan Government has declared that it will clear all remaining minefields (26Sqkm) before 2020.
The Landmine Monitor has recommended the following for action in Sri Lanka.
a) Continued efforts should be made to implement efficient land release methodology and to more accurately define the size of remaining contamination.
b) Sri Lanka should implement its resources mobilisation plan to ensure mine action activities can meet the 2020 clearance target.
Sri Lankas section of the Monitor on casualties has mentioned in 2014, that the UNICEF reported that, since 1980 some 22,177 mine/ERW casualties have been recorded, including 1,603 civilian casualties, however, from 2006 to 2009 accurate casualty information was difficult to assess due to the ongoing conflict, likely resulting in under-reporting. In 2010, the Sri Lanka Army reported that since 1980, there were a total of 21,993 mine casualties, including 1,419 civilian returnees; 3,770 recorded amputees among the armed forces, Police and civil defence forces; and 16,804 mine casualties among the non-state armed group, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). From 1999 to the end of 2016, the Monitor identified 1,185 casualties in Sri Lanka (144 killed; 577 injured; 464 unknown).
The Landmine Monitor has identified 11 organisations which include governmental, local and international organisations engaged in victim assistance activities in Sri Lanka. Those are, the Ministry of Social Empowerment and Welfare, Rana Viru Sevena Rehabilitation Centre, Jaffna Jaipur Centre for Disability Rehabilitation, Sarvodaya, Social Organisations Networking for Development, Valvuthayam Caritas, Leonard Cheshire Disability Resource Center, Meththa Foundation, Motivation, UNICEF and the ICRC. Many of these victim assistance organisations are facing severe funding constraints making it difficult to carry out important victim assistance projects. Some of them have already ceased their activities.
The Landmine Monitor reported that Sri Lanka lacked adequate legislation to protect and respect the rights of persons with disabilities. The Draft Disability Rights Bill has been amended by the Department of Legal Draftsman, and the Ministry of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage is currently reviewing the proposed amendments. It further reveals, discrimination continued to occur in employment, education, and the provision of state services, including public transportation. Access to buildings and public transportation for persons with disabilities remained rare.
Loren Persi, Victim Assistance Research Coordinator of the Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor from Geneva, Firoz Alizada, Implementation Support Officer of the Mine Ban Treaty from Geneva, Dr. J. Ganeshamoorthy, Chairperson of the Jaffna Jaipur Centre for Disability Rehabilitation, S. Senthurajah, Executive Director of the SOND, Belinda Vause, Programme Manager-Sri Lanka for the HALO Trust, Prasanna Kuruppu, Advisor of the Disability Organisations Joint Front, Nillasi Liyanage, Youth Coordinator of the SLCBL, representatives of the demining agencies DASH and SHARP, Mine Risk Education organisations, representatives of the local and international organisations and university students also participated in the event.

Presidents action  strengthened UNP - Vajira
UNP supporters' bond with the party strengthened with the political changes made by President Maithripala Sirisena recently, Internal and Home Affairs and Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
The Minister was addressing a ceremony in Uluvitike held to welcome him after he assumed duties.
He said party members and supporters deviated from the UNP recently and with the President's attempt to change the government, the party members refreshed their loyalty towards the party.
Former Minister and UPFA MP Piyasena Gamage, former Deputy Minister and UPFA member Manusha Nanayakkara and former Minister Gunaratne Weerakoon joined the new government as a result, he said. "We don't know what the other members of their party would do in future," Minister Abeywardena said.
"Some of them would join us," he said.
He said he was entrusted with two powerful ministries this time and he already allocated Rs 700 million for the Ambalangoda Municipal Council.
The Minister said he would allocate enough funds for Galle and a significant development in the area can be carried out with the money.
Minister Abeywardena said the economy drew back in recent anarchy in the country.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has over 40 years of political experience and he can revive the economy, the Minister said.
The people do not understand the January 8 constitutional changes. They think the country has the same Presidential system as earlier. But it was changed after January 8," Minister Abeywardena said.
The Minister said constructive changes took place following the latest constitutional issues. "One is that the world saw that Sri Lankas judiciary is independent," Minister said.
"Another is that international community told tourists that Sri Lanka was safe for them to visit," the Minister said.
If the public elect members brake chairs and attack others with chili powder in the House, it is a tragedy, the Minister said.

PUCSL national plan in the offing
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), the electricity sector regulator and the shadow regulator for the lubricant market, held public consultation sessions in nine provinces this year to formulate a national plan for the sectors.
The PUCSL received public views and suggestions on streetlight management and issues of electricity, drinking water and petroleum sectors.
Over 1,500 people participated in the final session held in the North Central Province at the Golden Mango Resort Auditorium recently.
Over 8,000 public and government officers, institutions, business community and non-government organisations participated in year-round sessions and about 2,500 people representing government, non-government, social group and individuals submitted their written views and oral formats.
The PUCSL launched the sessions in March this year from the Southern Province.
Now we are developing a plan along with Provincial Councils, Local Government Authorities, representatives of consumers and other institutions. We received many valuable comments from every social platform and group, PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said. We will implement the plan in all provinces with the approval of the Government, he said.

Southee rescues NZ with bat and ball after Lakmal blast
CHRISTCHURCH, Wednesday: Tim Southee rescued New Zealand with the bat then dragged his side back into the match with the ball after Sri Lankas Suranga Lakmals career-best figures had threatened to dominate the first day of the second test in Christchurch on Wednesday.
Southee counter-attacked with wicketkeeper BJ Watling to blast 68 from 65 balls and take New Zealand from the depths of despair on 64 for six after Lakmal had destroyed the top order on a green wicket at Hagley Oval.
The 30-year-old Southee and Watling (46) combined for 108-runs as New Zealand were dismissed for 178 with Lakmal finishing with five for 54.
First test centurion Angelo Mathews was on 27 with Roshen Silva (15) as the visitors were 88 for four at stumps, with neither team holding the advantage as both seek to win the two-match series with victory in Christchurch.
The first test in Wellington ended last week in a damp draw after virtually all of the final days play was washed out.
The 31-year-old Lakmal, utilising the overcast, cool conditions and green pitch, had reduced the hosts to 36 for four after Dinesh Chandimal had won the toss and wasted little time in choosing to field.
Lakmal went to lunch having bowled 12 successive overs with figures of four for 18. Southee, whose innings of 77 not out in his debut in 2008 remains his highest score, then decided attack was the best form of defence and belted six fours and three sixes to resurrect his sides fortunes.
His dismissal, to a brilliant, one-handed leaping catch by Danushka Gunathilaka at short mid-wicket, sparked another collapse with the last three wickets adding just six runs.
Southee then took the first three Sri Lankan wickets to reduce them to 21 for three inside 10 overs.
The second victim  Chandimal for six  moved him to 234 test wickets and third on New Zealands all-time list.
Chris Martin had been in third on 233, although Southee is still a long way away from Daniel Vettoris 361 and Richard Hadlees New Zealand-leading mark of 431 wickets.
After his initial spell, Southee continued to be a threat towards the end of the days play as Silva and Mathews played and missed several times but saw their side through to stumps.  Agencies

Steyn becomes SA's leading Test wicket-taker
Dale Steyn statistically became South Africas greatest bowler on yesterday when he climbed top of the countrys leading Test wicket-takers list.On the first day of the series against Pakistan, Steyn, who has been plagued by injury for the last three years, had opener Fakhar Zaman caught at second slip to move to 422 Test wickets, taking outright top spot on South Africa's all-time list from Shaun Pollock.

Steyn claims outright South Africa wicket-taking record
CENTURION, Wednesday - Dale Steyn became South Africas all-time leading Test wicket-taker when Pakistans Fakhar Zaman became his 422nd victim on the first day of the first Test at SuperSport Park at Wednesday.
Zamans dismissal brought to an end more than three years of frustration during which the fast bowler missed no fewer than 27 Test matches because of injury.
Steyn was mobbed by his teammates after Zaman (12) edged the ball to Dean Elgar at third slip, reducing Pakistan to 17 for two after winning the toss and batting first.
Shaun Pollock, the previous holder of the record, was quick to praise his successor, describing him during a television commentary as an absolutely brilliant performer, an absolute champion and a true leader of the attack.
Slightly built, with a lithe, athletic action, Steyn at his best was capable of bowling at 150kmh, with late away swing accounting for many of the worlds leading batsmen. When conditions did not suit express pace he developed an impressive array of cutters and became a master of reverse swing with the old ball. Ironically, before a groin strain ruled him out of action midway through a Test in India, Steyn had been remarkably durable for a fast bowler, playing in 48 consecutive Tests from December 2009 to November 2015, during which he took 232 wickets at an average of 21.72 and dominated the International Cricket Council Test rankings for bowlers. He spent a record 263 weeks in the top spot.
Steyn took his 400th Test wicket in his 80th Test in July 2015 the second-fastest in the world to reach the milestone and it seemed Pollocks record was about to fall.
But four serious injuries delayed what had seemed imminently inevitable.
The groin injury in India was followed by a shoulder injury during the first Test against England in December 2015 and, after a brief comeback, a more serious shoulder injury against Australia in November 2016 caused him to miss 15 Tests.
Just when it seemed he had made a full recovery, he suffered a freak heel injury in the first Test against India in January this year, which caused him to miss the remaining Tests against India and a series against Australia.- AFP

## Title: THE TRUTH OF COMPETITION AT FIRST CHRISTMAS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, December 27, 2018 - 01:00
THE TRUTH OF COMPETITION AT FIRST CHRISTMAS
Human competition for prominence, they say, begins in the womb if they are twins or at birth and thereafter among the siblings. It happened in some way at first Christmas. At that birth divine, ruling King Herod of Judea, chose to become a competing twin of the newborn child Jesus, who was also recognized as a king.
This competition was an outcome of a fear of a king who did not tolerate even a new born child if he considered him as a challenge. Herods palace and the royal ambience turned chaotic and concerned with the arrival of three wise men, who were recognized as kings and who considered the New Born" as a King. The Gospel of Matthew narrates the story of the three Magi who came to worship Jesus, the new-born King of the Jews.
King Herod the great as he was known, ruled as a client king of the Romans who were occupying Judea at the time of Jesus Birth. He was not a Jew but an Idumaean, born to an Arabian mother and was not loved and accepted by the traditional Jewish elders. Though credited with the construction of the second temple of Jerusalem, King Herod was hated for being a pagan and for his loyalty to Romans to retain his political power, and for his ruthlessness, shown by killing a wife, two sons and a father-in-law among many others.
Jewish scholars
The devoted Jewish scholars believed that by the time of Jesus Birth, 76 generations has passed since Creation of the universe and according to prophecy, a Messiah was to deliver Israel from foreign rulers in the 77th generation. So when the visiting Kings (the Magi) inquired Where is the child who has been born King of Jews.... We have observed his star at its rising and have come to pay him homage, King Herod became excited frightened and had a pre-sentiment of a threat and a challenge. He called together all chief priests and the teachers of the Law and asked them, where will the messiah be born When he was told that it would be in Bethlehem, Herod started his strategy to kill the just born baby Jesus, his perceived competitor for the throne of Israel. When the Magi did not return to him with the information he wanted he ordered the massacre of innocents; infuriated.. he sent and killed all children who were two years old or under in order to get at baby Jesus head. This competition for power led him to such brutality.
Competition for prominence and power is nothing but an age-old phenomenon of the history of every country or culture. Our own Mahawamsa records many such episodes in Sri Lankan history where brother kills a brother or son kills a father all for the love for power and to ascend the throne. Sometimes the twin-brother competition can be seen even within a nation among its races. One trying to subdue the other denying the basic human rights of a person who was born in the same land.
At global level it happens when super powers clash in a subtle way for dominion over certain regions or sea routes or strategic points on the world map. Such dramatic efforts can be observed even today on the Sri Lankan stage by various powerful countries who want to have a hold on our strategic island. In that competition the weaker nations finally suffer and suffocate under economic or debt burdens heaped upon them and their unborn generations.
Peace message
The Birth of Jesus is celebrated above all as a feast of peace. Jesus message is Peace, His Kingship is service and His Kingdom is a gathering of people believing in forgiving love. For the Babe of Bethlehem, kingship or authority is service to mankind.
This He amply demonstrated by washing the feet of His disciples and sacrificing His life on the cross. His kingship is to recognize in every man the face of the divine. His teaching I was hungry you gave me to eat; thirsty, you gave me to drink; naked, you clothed me; sick and imprisoned, you visited me, shall be a measure with which ones life will finally be judged. This kingship is to feel for the other, his needs and his pain and not to dominate over the other or to suppress him.
His kingdom is that which He inaugurated by gathering a people who are to practice the beatitude of love that forgives. So He taught His disciples to pray to God the Father of all, saying Your kingdom come your will be done forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us and hanging on the cross later this Jesus born in Bethlehem cried out and said Father forgive them for they know not what they do.
This gathering of hearts is a call to all men to treat the other as a brother or a sister no matter who they are or what colour, what race, what language group, what continent she or he belongs to. Today we talk about globalization when it comes to politics, business, international relations and economic activity. But Jesus the Prince of Peace spoke about globalization of love and forgiveness, sharing and caring, peace - respect and harmony to all, more than two thousand years ago. This teaching goes even beyond basic human rights and justice. Human rights and justice are birth rights of every human being. But to respect the other as your brother or sister is more than recognizing his/her legitimate rights. That needs a loving heart, a heart that can forgive, a heart that can say, sorry I erred.
King Herod could not grasp or interpret either Jesus Kingship or His Kingdom foretold by prophets. So his heart did entertain hatred towards the new born child Jesus. Though Jesus was just born, he considered him as a twin of competition for his kingdom and his dynasty. So in his heart he contemplated how to eliminate this just born king and in his strategy he bled thousands of innocent children to death. Instead Jesus returning to Judea after Herods death, when the time was ripe, opened His heart for others and bled it to death to gather people in love, peace and brotherhood.
Christmas 2018 in Sri Lanka is celebrated in a context of political and social instability. Once again competing twins of power have played their roles in the drama of Sri Lankan politics and life. The ordinary citizen and the poor and the needy are bleeding and are fighting for their day-to-day survival.
Nationalism and patriotism
Northern brethren and other minorities both ethnic and religious are clamouring for the restoration of job opportunities, development of infrastructures and dignity as equal citizens of this country. Though we have established certain democratic norms where everybody is treated equal, we still hear divisive, hateful, racially discriminating thoughts being spread openly and loud and clear. Some leaders, among whom are even religious dignitaries, are perpetuating Twin competition for political and personal gain in the guise of nationalism and patriotism.
Let the parents, teachers and religious leaders do more to teach our children to shun violence, hatred and unbecoming behaviour. Protect them from evil forces who are waiting to devour them and lead them on evil paths that will bring the ruination of their future and the future of the country. May they be inculcated with religious values of all religions. Do not lie, do not steal, do not kill, respect the elders, accept the peers not as a challenge but as opportunities of friendship, be sincere in everything, be determined to achieve the goals of ones life should become their motto. The axiom Achieve your goals by hook or by crook, they should be taught, to throw away from lives.
As a nation we need also to take measures, learning from the experiences we have gone through, to avoid becoming slaves or a vassal state of any country or power block in Asia or in Europe or in America. Let us be resolved to work towards treating every human being born in this land as a Sri Lankan and give him/her the equal opportunities and facilities and all human rights, to live and grow and serve the motherland. May the Peace, Justice and Joy of Christmas bear fruit on the Sri Lankan soil and Sri Lankan hearts.

Unbeatable Kandy SC stamp their class
At the end of the first round Kandy Sports Club emerged as uncrowned kings of Sri Lanka rugby particularly with an unbeaten record having won all seven games. The side led by Richard Dharmapala comprised the following players Lavanga Perera, Damith Dissanayake, Sashika Jayawardene, Roshan Weeraratne, Keshan Kalhara, Arshad Jamaldeen, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Thilina Wijesinghe, Tharindu Chathuranga, Jason Dissanayake Suhiru Anthony, Ganuka Dissanayake, Yakoob Ali, Shehan Pathirana, Nigel Ratwatte, Vishwamithra Jayasinghe, Danush Dayan, Danushka Ranjan, Ashan Darling, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Lasitha Aththanagoda, Heshan Jason, Omantha Panthiywantha, Kelum Madussanka, Nipuna Thaak, Diluksha Fange, Malioth Wijesundara, M. Shabeer, Imad Reyal, Sanushka Abeyawickrema, Laskitha Ranaweera, Asitha Ratnayake and Chamika Perera. The success is attributed to commitment and dedication of these players, and the discipline they follow plus good coaching by Sean Wijesinghe and Fazil Marija and keenness of rugby committee chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya, that has really made them a formidable force in the first round.
If Kandy continues to play in this fashion they should have no problem in retaining the league title for another year. The Kandy forwards are very much heady compared to the other clubs - they are fast on their feet, the back division is virtually comprising national players. They now head into their New Year break flying high in the table.
In their last game of the first round which was played last Sunday at Welisara, Kandy SC were given a tough time by the seamen and it was only their last minute penalty put over by Thilina Wijesinghe that clinched the win for them 21-19.
In this game their scrum half Roshan Weeraratne, fly half Nigel Ratwatte and second rower Shehan Pathirana played very intelligently and had the Navy SC XV back peddling with their heady performance. They did all the good work when their team were trying to put their act together. Navy SC proved that they could match up to Kandy SC and did well to prevent the powerful side from crossing their goal line, but Kandy knew how to get things done their own way.
The game began with the sailors scoring first through a penalty from Thilina Weerasinghe and Kandy Sports Club came into game by dominating the proceedings. The sailors when they won possession looked dangerous with their forwards and three-quarters running the ball in splendid fashion and led until the final minutes of the game. Their fifteen were outstanding during the entire game. The three quarters play was a hectic battle where Kandy SC had the edge thanks to some good play by the forwards who clicked well. Kandy SCs defence was strong, they played in the right areas and the tactics from the boys was outstanding.
In the first round Kandy SC beat Air Force SC 28-14, Police SC 32-23, Army SC 38-10, CR & FC 41-30, CH & FC 38-22, Havelock SC 31-21 and Navy SC 21-19. The present standing is 1) Kandy SC, 2) Havelock SC, 3) CR & FC, 4) Navy SC, 5) Army SC, 6) CH & FC, 7) Police SC, 8) Air Force SC.
Kandy will play their second round on January 5 or 6 against Air Force SC at Nittawela. The rest of the matches to be played at Nittawela are v Army SC, v Navy SC, v Police, v CR & FC, v CH & FC and v Havelock SC.

Warner asked me to tamper with ball, says Bancroft
MELBOURNE, Wednesday: Banned Australian player Cameron Bancroft on Wednesday confirmed David Warner asked him to alter the ball during the tampering scandal in South Africa and said he went along with it to fit in.
Bancroft was seen using sandpaper to try to rough up the ball in the Cape Town Test in March, receiving a nine-month ban from international and domestic cricket for his part in an incident that rocked the sport.
Warner and then captain Steve Smith were exiled for a year after all three were found to be involved.
A Cricket Australia investigation pointed to Warner as the mastermind and Bancroft revealed more details in an interview with former Australia wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist on Fox Sports.
Dave suggested to me to carry the action out on the ball given the situation we were in the game and I didnt know any better, said Bancroft, whose ban runs out this weekend.
I didnt know any better because I just wanted to fit in and feel valued really. As simple as that.
The decision was based around my values, what I valued at the time, and I valued fitting in ... you hope that fitting in earns you respect and with that, I guess, there came a pretty big cost for the mistake.
At the time, Bancroft had been forging a new Australian Test opening partnership with the more experienced Warner. But he made clear he did not consider himself a victim.
I had a choice and I made a massive mistake and that is what is in my control, said Bancroft, who admitted he often pondered what would have happened if he had said no, and concluded it was a no-win situation.
I would have gone to bed and I would have felt like I had let everybody down. I would have felt like I had let the team down. I would have left like I had hurt our chances to win the game of cricket. - AFP
