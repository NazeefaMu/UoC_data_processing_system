SP Governor highlights development goals: Over 30,000 countrys tanks underutilised
Over 30,000 tanks in the country have not been used for development to date.
The ancient kings built tanks and these should be used for present needs, Southern Province Governor Dr. Hemakumara Nanayakkara said.
He was addressing a meeting at the Angunakolaplessa town hall where self-employment goods were distributed to the needy under the 2017 poverty eradication programme.
Water of the Angamedilla wewa and Rewathee wewa was pumped to the highlands via canals in the ancient time, he said.
The governor added that the country has several fully-fledged salterns but salt is imported. He said the country produces only 35 percent of milk and the rest is imported as packeted milk powder. Hemakumara said fish is imported because modern fishing methods are not used though the country is surrounded by the sea. We import green gram from Australia and kurakkan from other countries althogh we have a fertile soil in our country.
About Rs. 15,000 to 20,000 billion is spent to import consumer items annually, he said.

Alert Parliament employee saves the day
A fire which could have destroyed the Chamber of Parliament had been averted by an employee of the House Keeping Department on Monday, Parliament sources revealed yesterday.
The employee had seen a whirl of smoke from a high-powered wall lamp below the public gallery above the back benches of the MPs in the House of Parliament. Sources said that the employee had alerted the other staff and Police and subsequently had come there to remove all local and foreign visitors from the public gallery. The sources said by this time, a group of school children had been sitting in the public gallery. Sources also said that later it was found that a handkerchief of a student had mistakenly dropped and entangled on the wall-lamp. The handkerchief had fallen inside the lamp and caught fire after several minutes.
The employee climbed down from the gallery using a flagstaff fixed near the gallery and removed the handkerchief and extinguished the fire, sources revealed. He avoided a great disaster which could have cost Parliament immensely.

The special committee to look into the ways the sand deposit at the proposed Yan Oya reservoir construction site in Anuradhapura could be used, recommended that 100,000 cubes of sand be handed over to the Sri Lanka Army or be sold at a public auction, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. B. Wanninayake said.
He was addressing the Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee meeting at the Kachcheri auditorium, recently.
He said the Yan Oya reservoir sand deposit should be used appropriately. The GA added that steps were taken to ascertain the full capacity of the sand deposit with the assistance of relevant departments.
"We will dispose of the deposit appropriately. A portion will be provided to villagers for construction work. At present, the Mines Bureau had stopped issuing sand permits due to malpractices taking place in the issuance," the GA said.
Meanwhile, residents in Welioya, Wahalkada and Pamburugaswewa demanded to take immediate steps to renovate the roads in the area damaged due to the transport of sand by heavy vehicles.

The Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a Global 500 company with its subsidiary company, AVIC International Hotels Lanka Limited had recently produced a progress update with regards to the upcoming formative construction project of the AVIC Astoria in Colombo 03.
The AVIC Astoria, which is scheduled to be unveiled to the public before the end of 2017, is set to be a high-rise building will comprise of 4 towers totalling 608 apartments.
A focal and much anticipated feature of the upcoming Astoria will not only be the enormity of the project being constructed in a central location with close proximity to the city and all other influential landmarks of Colombo being close by but also the amazing view being that of the sea as well as the surrounding area of the city limits itself.
Another major attribute about AVICs involvement with the construction phase of the Astoria is the swift implementation of the build-up by the labour force as well as the use of state-of-the-art and leading edge technology from China. The use of aluminium formwork has been much talked about and is known to be the first time this is being incorporated into a construction project in Sri Lanka.
Astoria also ensures that the surroundings for future residents will not be compromised in terms of the view. Irrespective of the apartments position from any of the four upcoming towers, residents are guaranteed to experience not only breathtaking views but also soothing breezy days and nights.
To arrange a viewing of Astorias mock apartment or to seek further information, contact the AVIC Astoria office at Deal Place, Colombo 03. You can also visit their website at www.astoria.lk

BASL explains role in Kannans appointment as HC Judge
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in a statement yesterday explained the BASLs role in the appointment of R.Kannan as High Court Judge.
The association said there has never been a practice of either the Bar Council or the Executive Committee of the Bar Association or Branch Associations approving persons that are to be recommended for appointment to the judiciary, the statement said.
The statement: There has been much speculation and allegations related to the above appointment and the role of the Bar Association in relation to it.
For over a year, representations were made by lawyers, especially from the Eastern Province, that there was an acute shortage of High Court Judges in the Northern and Eastern Provinces conversant in the Tamil language resulting in a backlog and delay in disposal of cases. These representations were made both at the Bar Council and Executive Committee meetings of the Bar Association.
This issue was taken up at the regular Bench and Bar meetings between representatives of the Bar Association and His Lordship the Chief Justice and other members of the Judicial Services Commission on several occasions.
At these meetings it was indicated that there was a serious shortage of Tamil speaking career judges senior enough to be promoted to the High Court and that even the Attorney General;s Department was unwilling to release its officers conversant in the Tamil language for such appointments due to its heavy reliance on its very few Tamil officers.
Consequently it was suggested that if members of the Unofficial Bar even from the Northern and Eastern Provinces were willing to give up their practise and offer themselves for such appointment the same will be considered and that they could be posted outside the province of their practise. Previously some members of the unofficial bar in Colombo were requested to consider accepting appointment but such was not successful.
In August 2016 a member of the Akkaraipattu Bar was recommended and his application supported by a senior Presidents Counsel was forwarded to His Lordship the Chief Justice to be considered for such appointment through the constitutional process, but this did not materialise.
In September 2016 Mr.R.Kannans application was forwarded by the President of the Batticoloa Bar to the undersigned. The referees were a former Attorney General and a retired additional Solicitor General as Mr. R. Kannan, prior to taking up private practise, had been an officer of the Attorney Generals Department for close to Twelve years.
Upon inquiries from officials of the Bar Association as well as the Batticaloa Bar and Eastern Province practitioners, Senior Silks and other members of the Attorney Generals Department about his suitability the undersigned was advised that he is a competent individual of integrity, trilingual, with over seventeen years as a practitioner enjoying a successful practise at the Batticoloa Bar of which he was the Secretary, though Mr. Kannan, in fact hailed from Matale.
Accordingly, the application of Mr. Kannan, as directed, by His Lordship the Chief Justice, was forwarded by the undersigned to His Excellency the President the appointing authority for consideration, with copy to His Lordship the Chief Justice and the Minister of Justice by the undersigneds letter of 21 st September 2016.
In the meantime, representations continued to be made to the Bar Association as to the delay in appointing Tamil conversant judges to the Northern and Eastern Provinces due to the retirement of two High Court judges aggravated by a policy decision not to continue to appoint already retired Tamil conversant judges as Commissioners.
Due to this prevailing situation around September 2016 a capable Muslim judicial officer, conversant in Tamil though junior in the seniority list of career judges was appointed as a Commissioner with the intention of giving him a permanent High Court judges appointment when he reached the required seniority.
Against this background and delays discussions continued for the need to make early appointments especially as the application of Mr. Kannan, from the Unofficial Bar, was pending since 21 st September 2016.
There was never any concern or reservation communicated to the undersigned related to the suitability or otherwise of Mr. Kannan for appointment, or any suggestion to such effect, which the undersigned believes is based on some incorrect information or misunderstanding. Consequently there was never any appeal or the need for same by the undersigned or a delegation of the Bar Association related to pursuing the application of Mr. Kannan.
The appointment of Mr. Kannan, was eventually effected by His Excellency with the concurrence of His Lordship the Chief Justice and the Judicial Services Commission and the Honourable Attorney General and in accordance with the Constitution.
His Excellency is reported to have stated that he made his own inquiries before making the appointment.
The undersigned wishes to clarify that there has never been a practise of either the Bar Council or theExecutive Committee of the Bar Association or Branch Associations approving persons that are to be recommended for appointment to the judiciary though there have been several apppintments to the judiciary from the Unofficial Bar in the past.
It is also pertinent to note and recognise that the Bar Association has constantly maintained that courts, especially the Apex and higher courts, should comprise a healthy mix of members of the career judiciary, the Official and Unofficial Bars. In fact the yardstick referred to in the past has been 4 : 2 : 1 i.e. for every four (4) career judges two (2) from the Official Bar and One (1) from the Unofficial Bar should be appointed.

Better plan for solar energy and coal-hydro compatibility
I was very happy to see the news items in the local papers on the first ever PV Solar park at Hambanthota commissioned to develop 10 megwatts and I could imagine how happy the Minister and State Minister would have been. Why I was so happy was that according to the Long Term Generation Plan of the CEB for 2015-2034, this 10MW unit at Hambanthota will give us at least 45000 GW hrs of energy in one year - three times our annual electricity consumption.
I am sure CEB ,Chairman Dr. Anura Wijepala will vouch for the accuracy of my interpretation of this graph. Did all those politicians, advisers, technocrats, consultants who make pronouncements on various platforms about what percentage of Sri Lanka's energy should be derived from Renewable Energy even care about what percentage of pages in the Long Term Generation Plan of CEB was devoted to their pet subject Renewable Energy or about the accuracy of the figures provided in the report.Counting the number of the pages is the simplest thing one could do and the more technically savvy ones could check the accuracy and if you haven't even done that, your high level statements are worth nothing for the simple folk of this country and is only an unbearable cost for the country,leading to the droughts we face today and will be facing in the future.
Then there was this news item in the Lanka Pages that the State Minister had mentioned that we are heading for some power cuts and hydro reserves are much less this year. This was followed by a statement from the Minister of Disaster Management indicating how the drought has influenced agricultural production, need to import rice (food security), drought , unavailability of water (environment security) loss of hydropower (energy security) and all this contributing to an economic downturn.
And I was thoroughly confused. When the intelligentsia of this country including academia and corporation heads appear to be extremely relaxed and negligent in respect of these critical issues.
Better plan for solar energy
This led to a series of thought processes in my mind starting with what happened on December 3, 2015. State Minister of Power and Energy had convened a session at the Parliamentary Complex to discuss the Long-term Generation Plan of the CEB, from which I had extracted the graph given above. The Secretary of Power and Energy and Dr. Thilak Siyambalapitiya joined the discussion later.
I believe, I was invited because when the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka had a public discussion on September 25, 2015 on this Plan at the BMICH. I said that Coal and Hydro power are not compatible partners in the generation of electricity in Sri Lanka and the actual cost of a unit of coal power would be about Rs.30 per kWhr. I don't think anybody took any notice of it.This cost was Rs.86 per kWhr in 2014 and today that cost may have gone beyond Rs.100 per kWhr.
When coal power is brought in hydro power automatically goes down; desertification sets in.
During this public discussion I explained how Highway Solarisation could provide the electricity we need without any ill effects and how it could benefit both the economy and the environment as well. So at this 3rdDecember, discussion also, I told the State Minister what Highway Solarisation could do in way of generating PV Solar energy, how it could save millions of rupees as foreign exchange, how it would eliminate cracking of roadways, etc. and I believe he was convinced to a reasonable degree about this approach to power generation. Of course, only he could tell how far he had been convinced that day.
Then another renewable energy promoter walked into the room and after listening for a few minutes, he said, Sir, I have a Better Plan and explained how Roof Top Solar Panels would bring in greater benefits. One year has elapsed since then, and I don't know how much of roof top solar power had been brought into stream.
Although I had already done the comparisons between different solar energy options available at that time, I had not put it on paper and I thought I would prepare this table given as Figure 3. It depicts a comparison of three possible approaches to obtaining PV solar energy to the electric grid. The comparison is in respect of 17 parameters and in respect of each parameter the rating of the particular option is given as 1 to 3 stars - 3 stars the best fit and 1 star the least.One could see that while Highway Solarisation has got 51 stars, Roof Top Solar gets 13 stars and Solar Park gets 11 stars only.
This diminished rating of Solar Park is primarily due to the deforestation involved in the process and contribution it makes towards droughts. How would deforestation contribute to droughts As I mentioned in my previous articles additional concentration of CO2 increases the temperature and increased atmospheric temperature makes the atmosphere retain more water vapour without allowing it to fall. So to reduce droughts you need to have a mechanism to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere and probably the only natural way of doing it is through absorption by forestry to aid plant growth. Plant growth through photosynthesis involves using about 8% solar radiation to make plants absorb CO2 and this absorption rate depends on the type of trees. Even the smaller plants and shrubs help in this process.
Then this vegetation will reflect solar energy as ultra violet radiation and this could be as high as 25% for green grass. Furthermore these trees also lead to trans-evaporation to keep the atmosphere cool. When we eliminate vegetation, the water that will evaporate to reduce atmospheric temperature will be surface water leading to dry and cracked soil. The water for trans-evaporation is basically brought up from the roots and put into the atmosphere through stomata in the leaves. Thus the outcome of deforestation will be that we eliminate the only avenue of reducing CO2 and create a much warmer environment, exactly what we experience today. All these aspects could be quantitatively expressed supported by references.
We have already commissioned two units of 10MW plants and two more such plants are in the construction phase. When environmental impacts of these units were carried out, it was spelt out that so many new acres of land has to be reforested as a mitigation action. Now that these two units are commissioned, we need to prescribe a period say one year within which the reforestation is to be completed and any new lands under construction should also be governed by the same regulation. But we should not pursue the construction of any more solar parks in the future.
Why Sri Lanka is unique
One may wonder why we can't do it in Sri Lanka while there are sizeable Solar Parks and Coal Power Plants in other parts of the world. The reason for this stems from the atmospheric circulation models given in figures 4 and 5. These two are taken from Frontiers of Climate Modeling by Professors T. Kiehl and V. Ramanathan, published by the Cambridge University Press.
It was only last month Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Joint Programme on the Science and
Policy of Global Change published a note in Journal of Climate on how an MIT Team of Researchers has found out that predictions based on these large scale atmospheric circulation models yield much more accurate predictions on extreme weather conditions than more sophisticated climate models published recently. If one looks at these two sketches indicating the latitudinal circulation around 70N and longitudinal circulation around 80oE (Sri Lanka's coordinates), one could see that this combination is a unique configuration. The latitudinal circulation around 70N goes up and towards 300N and comes down and back to 70N. This air going N will drop the moisture, but collect some CO2 from up to the surroundings of New Delhi and will come back.
As we eliminate forest cover in both countries around this route this enhancement of CO2 in the atmosphere will continue and this may explain the recent, continuing droughts and floods in Tamil Nadu. This rate of circulation is 120-150x109kg/sec.
If one looks at the Walker Circulation, one would see that the longitudinal circulation at our 800E location is about 0-10 x 109 kg/sec and thus there will be no circulation inthat direction. This would prompt one to understand that Sri Lanka cannot be adopting those many possible alternative technologies to generate electricity being practiced elsewhere. So Sri Lanka is unique in this respect.
Sri Lanka can neither use anymore coal power plants nor anymore solar parks and the best option for Sri Lanka will be to use Highway Solarisation as much as possible. Its advantages are easily visible in the above given table.
In fact I wrote to His Excellency the President in March, 2015 and suggested that we establish Highway Solarisation projects to generate electricity and indicated the numerous advantages of the same. I was requested to make a presentation to a team of engineers from the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau and Mahaweli Ministry and this was done. But I understand that the Ministry of Mahaweli has decided to install Solar Parks on Mahaweli Land and establish Floating Solar units on the reservoirs. Recently it was mentioned in the media that the Government is interested in establishing a 100 MW Solar Park at Siyanbalanduwa which will probably deforest 450 acres for the purpose. The government is also reported to be working towards a target of 32% forest cover for Sri Lanka.If deforestation is planned for this, the explanations given above would be adequate to indicate repercussions of such an effort as it would lead to more droughts, etc.
All these explanations will indicate that given the unique position of Sri Lanka, Highway Solarisation is the Best Plan for using Solar energy.
His Excellency the President and Minister of Mahaweli as well as Environment and former Member of Parliament, representing Polonnaruwa district obviously would not like to see Mahaweli reservoirs running dry or his own voters and their grand-children remembering him as having contributed to these future droughts. And then there may not be enough water to send to the north as expected from his pet project Moragahakanda multi-purpose project.
Coal - hydro compatibility
Now we can look at the Coal - Hydropower compatibility. We had been prompting about this since September, 2015 and it is sad that nobody took any notice of it. I have already mentioned how it happens and we, in this unique island called Sri Lanka could not be using any more coal power. It is the economic implication of Coal - Hydro incompatibility that I intend to address currently.
In the year 2016, we have produced 3462GWhrs of hydro energy with 1377 MW hydro capacity, whereas we have made 3632 Gwhrs and 4904 GWhrs in 2014 and 2015 respectively with the same capacity. On the other hand we have made 3202 GWhrs,4443 GWhrs and 4977 GWhrs of electricity from coal during 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. Somebody might say that we have not been getting the same level of rainfall & therefore same level of hydro power even in the absence of coal power.
Our hydro energy generation over the years in the past has been variable due to the two factors of (a) changing hydropower capacity and (b) the amount of rainfall received. In order to adjust for hydropower capacity variations we have calculated the number of hours of hydropower generated by dividing the total hydro energy generated by the hydropower capacity available during the year and to adjust for year to year variability we have calculated the five year moving average number of hours of hydro power generated calculated earlier.
This five year moving average has been decreasing for the last four years and crossed 3000 hour mark in 2016. Furthermore we have lost a significant portion of agri-production and the overall economic cost of this coal power to the nation is enormous.
This is a cost we ignored either by design or default when we wrote those pages and pages of articles to justify the first coal power plant.
In fact, on 20th January, 2015, Dr. ThilakSiyambalapitiya wrote that a Bold decision was taken by the country's leadership to establish the coal power plant in 2005. When one is taking a decision for one's own organization, Boldness may be an adequate aspect for the decision making.
For example, in 2008 I made the Bold decision of compromising my consultancy work for doing research (desk-desearch)on climate change, energy security, etc. Our own President was concerned at that time when there were signs to the effect that even powerful countries would be compromising food security for the sake of energy security and the President boldly stressed that Sri Lanka would not compromise food security for the sake of energy security.
I could not see much positive signs of any solutions been developed for climate change. So I took that Bold decision; but only I suffered as a result. But as a result of that Bold decision made in 2005, in a sincere effort to ensure energy security without compromising food security, the totality of all the fundamental securities of Sri Lanka - energy (lower hydro), food (rice to be imported), economic (rice import, oil import, etc.) - had been compromised. The reason was that the decision was not Well Informed. It is left to the technocrats in different related establishments and the relevant consultants to provide that information to the decision makers.
At a time when the whole world was talking about greenhouse gas emissions the technocrats and consultants should have studied and provided a well-informed solution and not a solution completely rejected by almost all environment conscious countries in the world. This is more relevant for a small country like Sri Lanka experiencing the Hadley, Walker Circulations indicated above. The only other attraction that would have been there in the coal power plant may have been the possibility of starting a new trading company to handle the coal imports.
This year 2005 is a very interesting, significant, change-over year for hydropower in Sri Lanka as during the six years ending in 2005, the average number of hours of generation of hydropower capacity has been varying consistently between 2277 and 2773 and never reached even 3000 hours.
Only solution left
So we have seen
(a) the incompatibility between Coal and Hydro,
(b) Sri Lanka due to its location at this specific 70N, 810E location, cannot add more CO2 to the atmosphere without suffering more disastrous consequences.
It is our intention to look at the options available. If we take all these pronouncements about percentages of renewable energy by 2030 and reduction of Greenhouse Gases as required per Paris Accord seriously, what we have done upto now seems to be counter-productive. So what we propose is a consolidated programme which will yield anticipated amounts of renewable energy as well as reduce the Greenhouse Gas Emissions as well.
What we need to remember is that if we keep on doing the things which we are doing now - keep on burning coal and emit more and more CO2 to get electricity, clearing vegetation in the name of renewable energy and thereby eliminate the only avenue of removing CO2 from the environment and increase oil driven transportation and emit more CO2 - we will not be able to achieve any of the above mentioned prudent and sacred objectives. It is for this reason that we need to look at alternative solutions to achieve both these objectives and what we propose - Highway Solarisation - has the potential towards achieving both the above mentioned objectives.
It could enhance the percentage of renewable energy in our energy mix while maintaining the CO2 levels at reasonable levels and ensuring that hydropower availability does not get depleted. This addresses the three most important issues today - namely

(a) how would you generate energy without increasing CO2 level in the atmosphere in a set up where CO2 generated by a coal power plant has resulted in a drought of catastrophic dimensions (damage is considered to be beyond $ 1.5 billion),
(b) significantly reduced hydro power and
(c) thermal transportation forms the corner stone of a tourism industry which touched 2 million tourists in 2016 and gearing up to reach 4 million tourists in the near future.
Only way forward is Highway Solarisation implemented as fast as possible so that you are ready for end 2017 tourist season with a reasonable percentage of electricity for both the grid as well as battery electric vehicles which would form the backbone of tourist transportation.
Obviously, can there be a more compatible partner for hydro than solar power or can there be a better place to lay those solar panels than the highways absorbing about 90% of solar energy falling on the same only to be reemitted as infra-red, long wave radiation to be absorbed by the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and reemitted leading to global warming and droughts and accompanying misery.
If this is not done, Sri Lanka could get into an extremely dangerous vicious circle, where coal energy and thermal transportation to meet the demands of enhanced tourism could drive hydro power to still lower levels and ultimately to a situation like in Chile to face wild fires.
As I mentioned earlier, Chile is one of two countries where coal and hydro provide near 30% levels of electricity in the main grid. In Sri Lanka coal has already over taken hydro. Unfortunately, in today's context, the options available are limited to one - which is highway solarisation.

Buddhika goes to BC against Sujatha Balika Principal
United National Party (UNP) Matara District Parliamentarian Buddhika Pathirana lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission yesterday, with regard to arbitrary conduct of the Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya Principal.
MP Pathirana said; The principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya is allegedly involved in producing fake vouchers and bills with the aid of some teachers. The principal has taken measures to appoint clerks who are supportive of her as teachers. Also priority has being given to teachers who are supportive to her arbitrary conduct over qualified senior teachers when appointing grade coordinators.
He further said that money has been allegedly collected from students continuously without even issuing any source document.
MP Pathirana requested the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption to conduct immediate investigations into this matter. Patirana said that principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya was backed up several individuals including past pupils, School Development Committee representatives, politicians and police officers in favour of illegal and unethical benefits.
Pathirana said that income sources of the principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya should be assessed to trace as to how a principal of a national school was able to build a luxury house within a short time period of being appointed as a principal.
MP Pathirana further said that parents and students had issued affidavits regarding the allegations committed by the Principal of Sujatha Balika Vidyalaya. He said that principal of Sutjatha Balika Vidyalaya would be suspended and a complaint would be lodged against her for the damages caused to the central electricity system at his main office premises in Matara yesterday morning. Buddhika Pathirana also said that independent commissions should be empowered further.

CB Governor testifies before Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue
Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy answered in the affirmative when asked whether the bids accepted at the Treasury Bond auctions were not in line with the amounts stated in the notice on February 27, 2015 and March 29, 2016.
The CBSL Governor was in agreement with the views expressed by Justice Prasanna Jayawardane.
The CBSL Governor was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds for the second day of the proceedings.
Justice Prasanna Jayawardane made the conclusion following a question he forwarded to the CBSL Governor regarding the Treasury Bond auctions held during Coomaraswamys tenure.
During your tenure were the bids accepted at the Treasury Bond auctions been approximately in the line with the amounts stated in the notice Justice Jayawardane questioned.
Yes, I think the Monetary Board took a decision that the amount offered would not be exceeded. The broad policy decision of the Monetary Board was that the amount offered should not be exceeded, the CBSL Governor replied.
Then, Justice Prasanna Jayawardane directed CBSL Governors attention to the time before his tenure where the bond issue at hand took place.
Going back to the time before your tenure, I think it is correct for me to say that the only instance in which the bids which were many time more than the amount stated in the notice were accepted on February 27, 2015. Is that conclusion of mine correct Justice Prasanna Jayawardane questioned, to which CBSL Governor replied that to his understanding it indeed
was the case.
Apart from the two aforesaid instances, generally the bids have been in line with the amounts stated in the notice, Justice Prasanna Jayawardane also pointed out.
Senior State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie who led the evidence also questioned the CBSL Governor whether the Central Bank generally accepts bids significantly more than it advertised.
President Counsel Nihal Fernando later appearing on behalf of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited pointed out to the Presidential Commission that during the mandate period there had been many instances where much higher amounts of offers have been accepted.
PC Fernando made the remarks based on a sheet to be authored, as he told to the Presidential Commission,by his client.
The commission later requested Fernando to furnish the dates on which such amounts of offers have been accepted.
Fernando failed to provide the Presidential Commission an authenticated document including the requested details at that point of time.
The Commission directed PC Fernando to provide substantial information if possible in the future.

CIMA Youth Ambassadors initiate 'Education Beyond Ability'
The CIMA Students Society or better known as CIMASS initiated a movement titled Education Beyond Ability.
CIMASS partnered with the Foundation of Goodness and constructed and equipped a Special Needs Centre in Dehigahalanda Maha Vidyalaya. Managed by the NGO School Relief Initiative (SRI), this project sought to set up a model centre which could be used as a benchmark for future projects of this nature.
The EBA initiative was launched in the hope that many more special needs centres would be set up in schools all over the island with the help of the community.
This initiative was first launched in March 2016, upon the identification of Dehigalanda Maha Vidyalaya through the screening process conducted by SRI.
This school had potential to help students with special needs but very little resources to do so, as a refurbished classroom and adequate number of teaching aides were needed for these students. Many well wishers and members of the public donated for this worthy cause.
The opening ceremony was held recently. The event was organised by the project officer L. K. A. Jayasinghe representing SRI and the occasion was graced by the presence of Wasantha Dissanayaka (acting Regional Education Director Tissamaharama), the Principal of the school T.G. Dharmasena, and Udari Ranaweera who heads the Centre, students from the school and CIMASS representatives.
Dissanayake applauded the effort made and stated that the responsibility of setting up such resource facilities is the responsibility of the government, but to see a students society such as CIMASS accomplishing such a feat is one that should be appreciated by all.

ComBank posts Rs 20.051 bn profit
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC continuing its trailblazing performance has reported profit before income tax (PBT) of Rs 20.051 billion for 2016, marking the end of a spectacular year in which it made history as the first private bank in Sri Lanka to surpass a trillion rupees in assets.
Profit before value added tax (VAT) grew by 18.58% to Rs 23.755 billion, the Bank said, disclosing that an increase in the financial VAT rate from 11% to 15% for four of the 12 months reviewed had resulted in the Banks VAT expense for the full year increasing by 28.17% to Rs 3.703 billion, from Rs 2.889 billion paid for 2015.
The 16.96% growth achieved in PBT was bettered by the growth in profit after tax, which improved by 21.92% to Rs 14.513 billion during the year ending December 31, 2016, the countrys benchmark private bank said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange.The Bank paid Rs 9.385 billion in taxes in respect of the year reviewed, an increase of 15.78% even after discounting the Rs 2.570 billion paid in 2015 as Super Gains Tax.
Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said: The Bank can take pride in the performance milestones reached in 2016, which reflect its ability to maintain its growth trajectory even in a rapidly changing environment. Doubling key components of our balance sheet in five years is no mean feat, and 2016 contributed significantly to this achievement.
Banks Managing Director and CEO Jegan Durairatnam observed that Improvement in asset quality and a stable rating are testimony to balanced growth, while improving Return on Equity(ROE) attest to the direction of growth in our 48th year. The improvement in asset quality was key to improving profitability and reflects strong credit processes and an improved risk culture, particularly in our front lines which are responsible for accepting risk.
Gross income of the Bank improved by a noteworthy Rs 15.275 billion or 19.62% to Rs 93.143 billion helped by a strong contribution from core banking activities with increased business volumes, which boosted interest income to Rs 80.738 billion, a growth of 22.27%, and Fee income increasing by 29.76% to Rs 8.143 billion principally through the growth of trade financing and card related business in the year reviewed.
Net interest income for the year at Rs 32.824 billion reflected an increase of 8.17% due to interest expenditure rising by a higher percentage of 34.27% to Rs 47.915 billion as a result of the increased cost of funds throughout the year under review,consequent to a substantial rise in interest rateson term deposits from which the bulk of the growth in deposits was witnessed. Meanwhile, net commission income improved by 30.54% to Rs 7.016 billion, with commission expenditure growing at a lower rate of 25.12%.
One of the significant highlights of the year reviewed was the growth of the Banks asset base by Rs 132.396 billion or 15.05% to reach Rs 1,012.2billion (Rs 1.012 trillion).
In surpassingthe Rs 1trillion markat the end of 2016, Commercial Bank hasmore than doubledits asset base, loans & advances and deposits over the past fiveyears.
Gross loans grew by Rs 107.224 billion or 20.38% over the 12 months of 2016 to stand at Rs 633.391 billion as at December 31. This was the second successive time that Commercial Bank increased its loan book by more than Rs 100 billion in a year.
Net loans and advances increased at a higher 21.24% to Rs 616.018 billion due to a reduction in impairment provisions required consequent to rigorous recovery efforts that resulted in a drop in non-performing loans (NPLs) in absolute terms, the Bank said.
The gross and net NPL ratios at the end of the year stood at 2.18% (2015- 2.74%) and 1.09% (2015- 1.41%) respectively, the reduction enabling the Bank to improve its provision cover to 50.11% from 48.49% a year ago. The Deposits portfolio recorded a growth of 18.50% or Rs 115.462 billion to Rs 739.563 billion as at December31 2016, reflecting average monthly growth of Rs 9.6 billion. This was the first year in which both the Banks loans and deposits grew by more than Rs 100 billion.
In other key financial indicators, the Banks total operating income of Rs 44.101 billion represented an increase of Rs 2.819 billion or 6.83%. Total impairment charges for loans and other losses reduced significantly, by Rs 2.413 billion or 61.20% to Rs 1.530 billion mainly due to the improvement in the quality of the loan book.
The increase in net profit to Rs 14.513billionhelped the Bank achieve a higher Return of Assets (ROA) of 1.53% and Return of Equity (ROE) of 19.52%,significantly higher than the 1.42% and 16.90% achieved in the previous year.

Coomaraswamy to take action against CB staff for any wrongdoing
Central Bank Governor Dr.Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that he is ready to take necessary action against Central Bank staff, if proven conclusively that, they were involved in wrong doings regarding various ongoing inquiries on the EPF and other transactions.
The Central Bank Governor made the observation when he was cross examined by Presidents Counsel Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, who led the evidence.
CBSL Governor Coomarasamy was yesterday summoned for the second day,by the Presidential Commission of inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds as the first evidence to the CB Treasury bond issue.
Presidents Counsel Dappula de Livera questioned the CBSL Governor whether in terms of the mandate, he has initiated an inquiry in terms of Central Banks code of conduct.
Justifying as to why he did not go down the road of trying to start an inquiry when he took over, the Central Bank Governor said there was a considerable amount of unease among the Central Bank staff when he took office.
I felt that the priority was stabilisation, he pointed out to the Presidential Commission.
The Central Bank has extremely important functions that are of national significance. So in my view, it was important to create conditions for the Central Bank to fulfill those functions, he said.
Having been a Central Bank employee myself for 15 years, I know the standards of the Central Bank, how they are recruited and how they are trained. It is an excellent staff despite despite having some issues, the Central Bank Governor pointed out.
Coomaraswamy also said that he felt his primary objective was to create a conducive condition for the Central Bank staff to fulfill their duties.
Replying to a question posed by the Presidential Commission regarding the Cntral Banks Internal Audit Department, he said the Internal Audit Department has responded to the Auditor General who is in the process of conducting investigations on behalf of the COPE committee.
Presidents Counsel Dappula de Livera then questioned Governor Coomaraswamy whether he is trying to tell the Presidential Commission that there are no wrong doers in the CB staff regarding the certain irregularities.
The Central Bank Governor said that he believes that there are a small number of wrong doers within the CB staff.

Country Roads longest running concert for children is back

South Asia's longest running concert for children is back for its 29th anniversary show 2017 line-up features Germany's Mavericks Duo, UK's Astrid Brook and Sri Lanka's Cosmic Rays, with Australian Keith Potger of The seekers fame also on board.
South Asia's and Sri Lanka's longest running concert for children, Country Roads, returns once more to the historic Mount Lavinia Hotel in 2017. This year's show is its landmark 29th anniversary edition.
To be held on March 19 from 6.30 p.m. onward, this year's show features its usual list of Country and Folk luminaries, from the Maverick Duo (Dirk and Wolfgang) from Germany, to UK's Astrid Brook, and Sri Lanka's own Cosmic Rays.
However, in addition, Country Roads is truly honoured to welcome legendary Wandering Minstrel, Australian Keith Potger, a founder of international hit-makers The seekers, to the 2017 show. The Seekers first stormed the UK charts in 1965, and have only grown in popularity and stature since then. In 2017, the concert is being supported by HNB, Dilmah, Cargills, Dialog, BBDO, LOLC, SriLankan Airlines, CPR, Firefly and Host Hotel Mount Lavinia Hotel, with tickets already available at Cargills Food City outlets in Kohuwela, Rajagiriya (Parliament Road), Kirulapone, staple Street, Majestic City, Mount Lavinia and Katubedde (Big City).
Country Roads concert for children has so far donated all its proceeds to children's charities in Sri Lanka. To date, the concert series has raised several million rupees, all of which has gone directly to provide aid to only the most pressing of causes that help children, a common practice since its beginnings in 1988.
In 2015, the concert contributed to Meth Mihira, a Special Education school in Koralawella, Moratuwa run by the Sisters Of Charity, as well as the Children's Heart Project of Sri Lanka, which supports the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital.
It also provided musical equipment to the Kudaligama Central College in Kalutara. Now 29 years young, the Country Roads concert for children is not just going strong, it is getting bigger and better.
This year, Seekers founder Keith Portger joins us for the every first time.
At the same time, we continue our exclusive, VIP dinner where guests interact one-on-one with our talented artistes, a unique initiative in its second year that has significantly increased our charitable giving. But most important of all, we have continued to put all our energies towards creating the most authentic and fulfilling Country, Western and Folk show for lovers of these genres, one that is mainly geared to provide entertainment for every member of your family.
Get ready for a real showdown, and come join us when we return to the Mount Lavinia Hotel on March 9, from 6.30 p.m. Onward, said Feizal Samath, the President of the Country Music Foundation, the organiser of the Country Roads concert for children.

DFCC Group nett profits top Rs 3 bn in 2016

DFCC Bank and DFCC Vardhana Banks profit after tax has crossed the Rs 3 bn mark,for the first time in the Banks history.
The financial year ended December 31, 2016 was the first full year of operations after the amalgamation of DFCC Bank with DFCC Vardhana Bank, which took place on October 1, 2015. The expectations were that the amalgamated Bank would reach new financial and other thresholds as a result of a successful blending of development banking and commercial banking coupled with significant synergies. In terms of the performance of DFCC Group, a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 3,469 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016. Apart from DFCC, major contributions were made by Acuity Partners, Lanka Industrial Estates and National Asset Management who posted Profits before Tax of Rs 299 million, Rs 111 million and Rs 39 million respectively in their individual financials.
As for DFCC itself, the Banks operating profit (before value added, NBT and income tax) reached a new high of Rs 5,400 million, a growth of 51% over the previous year. The outcome was that the bottom line (without extraordinary capital gains) recorded a strong growth of 60% to reach Rs 3,289 million compared to Rs 2,053 million in the previous period.
As such, it could be said that DFCC underwent a paradigm shift in 2016 in key financial and non financial metrics.
It was a year in which DFCC excelled in several metrics such as financial performance, employee engagement and brand enhancement. Total income grew 35% to reach Rs 26,754 million while proactive management of asset and liability pricing enabled a 25% growth in net interest income. This was aided by a successful drive to increase the current and savings base with innovative retail products, which diversified funding and stabilised interest margins. An increased focus on ancillary services, which included the Bancassurance arrangement with AIA, and introduction of unique digital banking delivery channels, like the Vardhana Wallet, helped achieve 14% growth in net fee and commission income.
Effective use of market opportunities helped post a 56% growth in trading results from FOREX and Government securities while the net gain from financial investments amounted to Rs 1,165 million, the bulk coming from a dividend of Rs 712 million from DFCCs shareholding of Commercial Bank of Ceylon. Overall, operating Income surpassed the Rs 11 billion mark to reach a new high of Rs 11,461 million.

India will not press for North East merger - Jaishankar
India will not be pressing Sri Lanka to merge the Northern and Eastern Provinces to form a single Tamil-majority, Tamil-speaking province as envisaged by the India-Sri Lanka Accord of 1987, Indian Foreign Secretary S. Jaishankar told the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Monday. He was reacting to a demand made by the leader of the Eelam Peoples Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF) Suresh Premachandran, that India should honor its promise to keep the North and East united. It had even said that it would not allow a referendum to be held on the issue. When the united province was de-merged in 2006 by a Supreme Court order, India did not protest saying that it was for the Sri Lankan government to appeal against the judgment. India had clearly lost interest in the issue. Its interests lay elsewhere in Sri Lanka. Jaishankar told Premachandran that much water has flown down the bridge since 1987 and as the situation has changed, it will be better for all concerned to make use of the various windows of opportunity which have opened up recently with the change of regime in Colombo and secure the rights of the Tamils.
He argued that it would not be wise to hold every other matter hostage to one issue - the merger of the North and East. However, he added that India would not mind if the Tamils kept the issue alive and kept it on the table for talks with the Sri Lankan government.
Premachandran had highlighted the issue of the merger of the North and East partly because it had been the main theme of the Ezhuga Tamil rally held recently in the Eastern town of Batticaloa. Premachandran is a key member of the Tamil Peoples Council which organized the rally.
The merger of the North and East is considered important by the Eastern Tamils because it helps them face the Muslims who tend to dominate them economically and politically. If the East were to be merged with the North, the Tamils will be in an overwhelming majority and can run the province as per their wish, and also bargain with Colombo more effectively for more powers.

JVP wants to know probe details on SAITM CEO shooting
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) yesterday demanded to know the revelations of the investigations into the shooting incident against the SAITM Chief Executive Officer.
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake making a special statement in Parliament said that there were reports of contradictory evidence and witness accounts leading to many doubts on the incident of Chief Executive Officer of SAITM coming under gun fire on February 6.
The Leader of the House and Higher Education and HighWays Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that Minister Sagala Rathnayake would reply to Dissanayakes demand today.
JVP MP Dissanayake said that the government has to tell the country the truth behind the shooting incident near Malabe Private medical college.
He said that the SAITM CEO Sameera Senaratne who identified himself as a doctor was said to have been shot at. He added that there were media reports that two unidentified persons came in a motorcycle and opened fire at Senaratnes car. There were subsequent attempts to place the blame and responsibility on those who agitated against the SAITM, MP Dissanayake said. MP Dissanayake also asked the progress of the investigations so far and what had been found in those investigations. During the round of questions for oral answers JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake also inquired from Minister Kiriella that the Sri Lanka Medical Council had said Sameera Senaratne was not a registered doctor and what was the stance of the government. He also asked if the government has to investigate into the incident as Senaratne had a narrow escape in the shooting incident.
Responding to MP Ratnayake, Minister Kiriella said that he was not aware of the qualifications of the said person and asked to raise a separate question on that matter.
However Minister Kiriella said that it seemed JVP MPs are worrying that the murderers missed the target.

The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday said that the appointment of R.

President of the Sri Lanka Bar Association (BASL) Geoffrey Alagaratnam in a letter to Chief Justice K. Sripavan on Tuesday in order to explain his organizations role in the appointment of R Kannan as High Court Judge said;
I wish to clarify that there has never been a practice of either the Bar Council or the Executive Committee of the Bar Association or Branch Associations approving persons that are to be recommended for appointment to the judiciary .
He did say, however, that it is customary to seek recommendations from leaders of the Bar when it comes to appointing judges from the Unofficial Bar: This I believe is a healthy tradition and it should be continued. I repeat that there is no requirement nor a practice that approvals be obtained for such recommendations from the Executive Committee, the Bar Coucnil of the Bar Association, or any Branch Association, Alagaratnam wrote.
He also argued that promotions to the higher judiciary should rest not only on seniority, but also merit.
The Bar has constantly maintained the position that promotions, especially to the higher judiciary, should apart from comprising members of the Official and Unofficial Bar and career judiciary not be on mere seniority but seniority and merit and that an adequate system of judicial audit is critical, he said
Alagaratnam likewise called for the Judicial Services Commission to have broader input from the President of the Court of Appeal, the Attorney General, , the President of the Bar Association and relevant civil society representatives to ensure a better informed approach in the matter of appointment and tenure of members of the minor judiciary.

Mexico's foreign minister rejects Trump deportation policy

Mexico has condemned new guidelines issued by the United States on deporting undocumented immigrants.
Under plans unveiled by the Trump administration on Tuesday, almost all people staying in the US illegally can be subject to deportation.
Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said his country could not "accept unilateral decisions imposed by one government on another."
The row comes as two top US officials are preparing to visit Mexico.
The White House said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the head of Homeland Security, John Kelly, would talk to Mexican officials and "walk through" the implementation of the new immigration guidelines.
Mexico anger ahead of Tillerson visit
They include plans to enforce an existing provision of the US Immigration and Nationality Act that allows authorities to send undocumented migrants back to Mexico, regardless of where they are from.
It is unclear whether the US has authority to force Mexico to accept foreigners.
But Videgaray said on Wednesday: "We are not going to accept that because we don't have to and it is not in the interest of Mexico."
Videgaray also warned the US about treatment of Mexican citizens.
"The Mexican government will not hesitate in going to international organisations, starting with the United Nations, to defend human rights, liberties and due process for Mexicans abroad according to international law."
Tillerson and Kelly were scheduled to discuss a range of issues with President Enrique Pena Nieto on Thursday, but Videgaray said the new changes to policy would now dominate the discussion.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said on Wednesday that he expected a "great discussion".
An estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants live in the US, many of them from Mexico. President Donald Trump made immigration and border control a key part of his campaign.
The new priorities are broad enough to apply to almost any illegal immigrant, including anyone who has been charged with a crime, misrepresented themselves, poses a risk to public safety, or "have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits".
The new guidelines also allow Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to deport people immediately.
Expedited deportations can now be used against undocumented immigrants who are unable to prove they have been in the country for more than two years, anywhere in the US.
Previously, expedited removals were applied to people who had been in the country for less than two weeks and were within 100 miles of the border.

Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres mooted to turn garbage into electricity
The Megapolis and Western Development Ministry has proposed to set up Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres to turn garbage into electricity. The plan which was approved by Cabinet yesterday also proposed to implement a feed-in-tariff (flat tariff for 20 years) of Rs 36.20/kWh for electricity purchases from these centres.
The proposal also asked that garbage not be dumbed at Kolonnawa-Meetotumulla but moved to these centres.
A cabinet proposal to establish Municipal Solid Waste Processing Centres was first put forward in December 2016. It asked that facilities be set up in Thumbowila, Karadiyana and Muthurajawela by Fairway Holdings Pvt Ltd and KCHT Lanka Jang Pvt. Ltd. The final approval, subject to conditions was granted in January 2017. For the last 20 years, garbage from the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area was dumped on 15 acres of land in Bloemendhal. In 2014, however due to wide protests from residents in the area, the Supreme Court asked the Urban Development Authority (UDA) to move the dump site on to two acres of land in Kolonnawa-Meethotumulla for two years during which a suitable solid waste management project should be formulated.
It is in response to this that the UDA together with the Ministry of Megapolis has come up with an energy generation project through garbage to find a more permanent solution to the mountains of garbage produced every day.
In January 2017, Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUBSL) was asked to come up with a way to finalize fair tariff structure for the waste energy project. The UDA reports that on September 6, 2015, the UDA sent an official letter to the CMC to stop dumping garbage at Kolonnawa and to identify alternative yards but received no response in return. On 21 December 2015, the UDA sent another notice reiterating their earlier request.

No confidence motion against Wayamba Governor
A no confidence motion against Wayamba Governor Amara Piyaseeli Ratnayake drawn up by a majority of governing party members of the Wayamba Provincial Council was handed over to Council Chairman Tikiri Banda Adhikari on February 21.
The motion alleged that the Governor had deliberately contravened provisions of the constitution by approving the procedure to be adopted by the Line Ministry to appoint a Provincial Education Director and naming members for a board of interview for that purpose, said UPFA member Sumith Rajapaksa who handed over the motion to the Council Chairman at his chamber at the conclusion of a crucial meeting held on February 21.
The governing party of the Council has 34 members and the opposition has 17 members in the Council which has a total of 51 members.
The motion, if it is to be adopted, should gain the approval of two thirds of the total membership in the Council, which means 34 members.
The motion maybe included in the crucial agenda on March 7.

Govt. sincerely taking measures to introduce new Constitution: Minister Kiriella
The Government would bring about a new constitution and the UPFA should give its support to make it a success, said Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He said that it was a historic moment that the country was experiencing due the UNP and UPFA having joined to solve the issue between the North and the South.
He made these observations yesterday, joining the Adjournment Motion moved by Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan.
The government is honestly taking measures to introduce a new constitution, Minister Kiriella said. We have no any hidden agenda.
He further said that even within the government there are some parties who do not uphold the mandate they received.
Some of these parties were not with us during the Presidential and General elections. It is we who formed this government, Minister Kiriella said.
There is no big difference between the UPFA and us. This is the only chance we got to formulate a new constitution. We should not let this opportunity slip through our fingers. Please lend your heart and hands to make this endeavour a success in the name of future generations of this country. We have nothing to hide. We are honest, he said.
Opp Leader wants Constitutional Reforms brought in genuine and purposeful manner
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan yesterday, making a strong case for Constitutional reforms, urged the Government to continue the process in a genuine and purposeful manner and move and act fast over its commitments in the UNHRC resolution.
He was moving an Adjournment Motion in Parliament on Sri Lankas International Obligations.
Making an emotionally charged speech for nearly one and half hours, Sampanthan stressed that Tamil people were almost losing their patience and beginning to feel disappointed that this Governments treatment to them was no different than the previous Government.
I dont think the national question could remain unsolved very long. Questions of missing persons, land, prisoners, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, reparation, Office of Missing Persons and non-recurrences are fundamental issues that need to be addressed with urgency, he said.
The Opposition Leader recapping all previous efforts in attaining a long lasting political settlement to the national question, quoted the documents of the Bandaranaike - Chelvanayagam Pact in 1957, the Dudley Senanayake - Chelvanayagam Pact, the Indo-Lanka Agreement in 1983, Mangala Munasinghes Select Committee, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas proposals in 1995 and 1997, as well as the Constitutional Bill in 2000, Oslo Communiqu in 2002, the speech of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Inauguration of the All Party Representative Committee and Multi-ethnic Expert Committee in 2006 and the joint statement issued by the UN Secretary-General and Mahinda Rajapaksa in May 2009.
Reading section after section of these documents, Sampanthan pointed out proposals in almost each of them were much beyond the scope of the 13th Amendment. He also pointed out most of these documents had given provision for the amalgamation of the North and East.
Stepping into the ring against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Prof G L Peiris over their recent comments on constitutional making, power sharing and devolution, etc., Sampanthan exposed how contradictory these were to their very own words in the past.
Prof G.L Peiris as the Minister of Constitutional Affairs in the Government of Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, presented the Constitutional Bill to the House in August 2000. There were many progressive proposals in it which were compiled by Dr Neelan Thiruchelvam and Prof G L Peiris. This draft Bill was approved by both Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa who were ministers in that Government. Unfortunately, legislation could not get through Parliament, as there was no consensus between the two major parties, he pointed out.
Commenting on the Oslo Communiqu, Sampanthan again reminded that Prof G L Peiris was the Chief Delegate on behalf of the Government in those discussions. The Opposition Leader quoting Prof Peiris at a press conference soon after signing the Oslo Communiqu in which he spoke supportive of power sharing within one country, pointed out this was what the TNA is asking now.
Quoting the verbatim of Rajapaksas speech at the Inauguration of APRC and MEEC in 2006, Sampanthan pointed out that Rajapaksa wanted these Committees to go for maximum possible devolution.
Sampanthan also reiterated that the TNA stands for a united and indivisible country with devolved powers. He also made a strong case for a referendum, adding that the very resolution to convert Parliament to a Constitutional Assembly mentioned this.
He also made it clear that they did not think every soldier was a war criminal, but individuals in the armed forces who committed heinous crimes such as murder and rape, must be identified and prosecuted. Soldiers who fought the war on behalf of the country were simply executing the orders of the State. We do not consider them war criminals, he said.
Sampanthan in his speech was also highly critical of Tamil politicians who had termed MP M A Sumanthiran as treacherous. One party, which got only 15,000 votes, is now trying to portray Sumanthiran, who got four times more votes than their whole party, as a traitor. We look upon Sumanthiran as a useful MP doing a valuable service to our people and country. Attempts on his life must be thoroughly investigated and those involved must be prosecuted, he said.
Housing complex for media personnel: Discussions underway
Discussions are underway with the Housing and Construction Minister for the construction of a housing complex for media personnel, said Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake.
He said that media personnel from the North too would be considered when those houses are granted.
Minister Karunathilake made these observations yesterday, in response to a question raised by Opposition Member Douglas Devananda in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister further said that three houses would be built for three journalists in the North who were affected in the three decade war, adding that the three houses would be built by the ANCL (Lake House), the Rupavahini and the Independent Television Network (ITN). He also added that two houses would be built in Jaffna, while another in Vavunia. He added that the three institutions have already allocated money for the purpose.
Weerawansa wants Speaker to accept NFF as independent group
The National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa, requested Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday to accept five NFF parliamentarians, including himself as an independent group in the Opposition in Parliament, since they have no connections with the UPFA.
Speaker Jayasuriya said that he would refer the matter to the Party leaders meeting scheduled today and would inform the outcome to the House. The Speaker also said that this was the first time that MP Weerawansa publicly stated that he had severed connections with the Joint Opposition.
MP Weerawansa said that he had informed the Speaker about the decision earlier, while the latter had failed to listen to his request. He added that he could submit the Hanzard report to prove that he was correct.
When the sittings commenced, MP Weerawansa had handed over the same request in writing to the Speaker months ago. We have informed you that the NFF MPs no longer have any connection with the UPFA and would act as an independent group, Weerawansa said. You stated that the matter would be taken up with UPFA leaders and would let us know of the result. However, so far we have not been informed of the result. This has deprived us of our rights. I request you to take the necessary action to enable us to function as an independent group in this Parliament. We have a right to be independent. Please give our rights.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said that he informed the UPFA leaders of the letter as soon as I received it. The UPFA leaders had written back to me and said that they had not been informed by your party of any such decision to be independent in the House, the Speaker said. You should inform them too of your decision to break away from them.MP Weerawansa said the matter was simple as they had broken their ties. He added that the UPFA leaders say that it was unacceptable.
At this stage the Speaker said that the UPFA leaders want Weerawansa to make a public statement.
For Gods sake is Parliament not a public place asked Weerawansa.
There is no need telling the gods. Tell it to this House, said the Speaker. I will discuss this with the UPFA and inform the House of my decision.
Weerawansa said that there was no need to talk with the UPFA but to give the Speakers decision.
Let me do my job, the Speaker said. I have a right to speak. I need to consult legal experts in this regard before giving my ruling. Let me do that.
At this stage UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena said that MP Weerawansa was not a member of the UPFA and there was no problem to allow them to be independent.
I too once faced a similar problem during the previous government, Minister Rauf Hakeem said. We contested under the UNP ticket. When we demanded to be considered a separate group, that request was turned down saying that we contested from the UNP. Then we accepted it. I was deprived of the chance of raising issues in the Chamber as a party leader. It was the last government which set that precedence.
Leader of the House Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said that it was yesterday that MP Weerawnansa made his intentions public. He added that when he informed the government of his intention, he was told said that it be stated in Parliament, but he did not do so then.
MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena responding to Minister Hakim, said that the then Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa stated that leaders of each party should be recognized. Minsiter Hakims issue is older than that.
Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said they contested under the Betel Leaf symbol and they agreed to do so under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa.  We hope that our rights and the rights of those who voted for us would be protected, Nanayakkara said. We have forwarded this issue to the International Parliamentary Union too. He said that the Speaker is the Chairman of that Union, while the Speaker denied it.
MP Nanayakkara said that the matter could be sorted out through discussions with the Speaker.
The Speaker said that 55 per cent or 60 per cent of the time allocated to the UPFA is given to the Joint Opposition. We have accepted Dinesh Gunawardena as the leader of the Joint Opposition, the Speaker said. Today MP Weerawansa for the first time made a statement in the Chamber expressing his partys wish to be independent. I would take this issue at the Party Leaders meeting tomorrow and let you know.
Parliament should make an attempt to see new constitution making process succeeding: FM
Parliament should have the courage to persevere in seeing that the new constitution making process succeed and take it before the people for their approval, in whom the sovereignty is vested to go forward united in its diversity, said Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister made this observation yesterday while joining the Adjournment Motion moved by Opposition leader and TNA leader R Sampanthan. Minister Samaraweera further said that the country after losing many opportunities to solve the issues of the country after independence was achieved, the country received a new lease of life on January 08, 2015 with the election of Maithripala Sirisena as the President of all the people of all religions.
He also said the people across the country gave a mandate at two elections to bring about lasting peace, a durable political settlement and protect the rights of all, irrespective of race, religion, caste and creed.
He also said that to achieve all these things, the country has to bring about the new constitution which Parliament too unanimously approved. He added that the new government could pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the Right to Information Bill, and enact legislation to establish a permanent office to undertake a humanitarian mission of finding the citizens who are still missing.
He also said that the government had been able gazette the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances Bill. He added that it would be taken before April. He also said that the new amended Counter Terrorism Act which would replace the PTA, would be presented to the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs. Once it was referred, the drafting of the new legislation would commence. He also said that we have reached an important juncture where the two main parties have united the new legislature could be formulated. The other important factor is that we have a moderate Tamil Opposition Leader and Opposition who is committed to a settlement with a united and undivided Sri Lanka. He added that the Opposition Leader says that they are not ready to accept a political settlement that is not accepted by a Sinhala majority in the South.
The Minister also said that these measures were not taken on the instructions of the International Community or the UN, but to bring about lasting peace that would enable the country to go forward unitedly in diversity. He added that every citizen should support this matter and bring about a solution by the 70th Independent celebration that all could walk side by side equally.
Increasing minimum salary of migrant workers: Minister Athukorala wants grace period of one year to implement proposals
Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala said that she had proposed to the Cabinet to grant a grace period of one year for the implementation of the Budget proposals of increasing the minimum salary of migrant workers up to US$ 350 per month and for skilled workers US$ 450 per month.
She made these observations in reply to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena under Standing Orders 23 (2).
She said a circular was issued by the Chairman of the Foreign Employment Bureau to all licensed foreign employment agents to implement these Budget proposals with effect from February 1, 2017, pursuant to Treasury instructions received on .
However, most labour receiving countries are not ready to grant the minimum wage of migrant workers. Further, there are many countries which send workers on low salaries. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan and some African countries are such examples. As a result, there is a possibility of losing job opportunities for Sri Lankans and it would in turn, have an impact on overall remittances, she said.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena, observing that foreign remittances of the migrant workers last year stood at US$ 7.2 billion, brought the attention of the House to a news article which appeared in an English weekly that the above mentioned budgetary proposal posed a risk to the foreign job industry.
The subject minister says that the budgetary proposal made by the Finance Minister for 2017, could not be implemented this year. This means the House had approved a proposal which was not being implemented and the budgetary proposals have been withdrawn in relation to the biggest foreign exchange earner of the country, he said.
Minister Athukorala replied that the proposal has not been withdrawn. We have only submitted a note to the Cabinet asking further time she said.

Partners to develop drone for remote ballast tank inspection

Dutch AkzoNobels Marine Coatings Business and the UK-based companies Barrier Group and DroneOps have teamed up to develop a drone capable of remotely inspecting ballast water tanks in an effort to improve accuracy, efficiencies, as well as the health and safety of ships crews and inspection personnel.
The project, entitled RECOMMS (Remote Evaluation of Coatings and Corrosion on Offshore Marine Structures and Ships), will use virtual reality technology and semi-autonomous operation of a drone to evaluate ballast water tanks and other difficult-to-access areas on vessels and offshore structures, including inspections of coatings and corrosion.
Carried out by crew, surveyors or independent inspectors, such inspections are said to be a risky activity which represents one of the most common causes of work-related fatalities in the industry.
By replacing human inspections with a drone, routine maintenance can be monitored remotely in real time by office-based staff, with instant feedback available to the vessel or offshore structures superintendent, RECOMMS said.
Surveys of enclosed spaces and ballast water tanks are an essential part of routine maintenance on board vessels and offshore structures, and are increasingly critical for ship owners.
However, inspecting these areas thoroughly can require working at height, entering confined spaces, and negotiating slippery surfaces that could be poorly lit, all of which are high-risk activities that the maritime industry is keen to address, Michael Hindmarsh, spokesperson for RECOMMS and Business Development Manager at AkzoNobels Marine Coatings Business, said. According to RECOMMS, the drone inspections have in the longer term the potential to ensure a systematic and consistent approach to enclosed space inspection by crew, producing data readily available for shore-based staff, flag states and class societies.

President wants IGP to draw up plan to combat ragging
President Maithripala Sirisena said he has directed the IGP to draw up a practical plan in association with the University administration to eradicate inhuman ragging in universities carried out by a minority student group disrupting the education of a majority of disciplined and law abiding students.
He said the Government is duty bound to safeguard the future of university students and as such it would fulfill that duty and responsibility without let or hindrance. He said no room can be left in universities for cruelty or the law of the jungle to reign supreme.
The President said this addressing the gathering at the 75th anniversary celebrations held at the Mathugama Ananda Shastralaya on February 22 morning.
The President said the torture of Peradeniya University first year agriculture faculty students carried out recently was a tragedy in the free education system.
Incidents of this nature harmed the honour and reputation of universities which produced intellectuals and men and women of learning. There were several black marks of ragging which had occurred in the history of our universities which dated back to 40 to 50 years. Children should not try to transform the sigh of relief made by parents of students entering universities into a tears of sorrow.
When schools in the Colombo City were transformed into British Military Camps during the Second World War the Mathugama Ananda Shastralaya was started on February 23, 1942 as a branch of the Kotte Ananda Shastralaya.
He also acclaimed the valuable history of the school which had produced a large number of local and foreign intellectuals throughout its golden history.
The President also unveiled a statue of the schools founder late Finance and Justice Deputy Minister Daya T Pasqual at the school premises.
The President also opened the schools new Technological Laboratory. A lacquer painted portrait of the President drawn by a student was also presented as a memento to the President by the student concerned on this occasion.
Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe and Dr Rajitha Seneviratne, Deputy Minister Palitha Thevarapperuma, Parliamentarian Kumara Welgama and Principal Randun Jayalath were also present in the occasion.

Private medical universities: GMOA stays neutral
The GMOA has taken a neutral stance on the subject of private medical universities and stated that it was up to the government to decide whether to establish private medical universities or not.
Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Naveen de Soysa, said the government should appoint a commission to study whether the country needs private medical universities or not and then establish them while maintaining minimum standards.
SAITM and our stance on private medical universities are two different things. SAITM is fraudulent.
The two cannot be compared, you cannot justify SAITM by saying that we need private medical universities, the two are different,stressed, Dr de Soysa addressing a media conference held at the GMOA headquarters yesterday.
The GMOA has also asked that SAITM be taken over by the state with compensation or alternative pathways to a medical degree found for current SAITM medical students with adequate qualifications to follow a medical degree. The Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) nor the University Grants Commission (UGC) in the meantime has prescribed standards for medical institutions.
GMOA East and NCP to strike today
Zahrah Imtiaz
The Government Medical Officers Union (GMOA) members from the East and North Central Province will engage in trade union action today.
Their actions follow that of the doctors from the Uva Province who launched trade union action for four hours on Tuesday.
The token strikes would be followed by protests in Ampara and Anuradhapura, said GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge yesterday addressing a media briefing at GMOA headquarters in Colombo 7.
We have put forward our recommendations to the relevant authorities 10 days ago and we are yet to receive a response. The government only understands strikes, so the union has decided to resort to trade union action, he said.
The GMOA central committee which was to meet yesterday would also decide on a plan to launch long term continuous protests throughout the country until the issue of SAITM is resolved, We will ensure that the patience do not suffer much and emergency services will be carried out throughout this period, he added.
The decision for an island wide strike is to be decided by Monday, said Dr Aluthge.
GMOA, Secretary, Dr Naveen de Soysa in the meantime said the trade union action was also against the two main ministers, Minister of Higher Education and Highways, Lakshman Kiriella and Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine, Rajitha Senaratne who he alleged to be on the side of SAITM.
He stated that the solution to SAITM should not be sought through courts but it was a political decision which needed to be made, the Executive should intervene and we believe that the President will take a good decision on the matter.
The President in the meantime has appointed a committee to study the issues surrounding SAITM and has promised to arrive at a decision which will be in the interest of the country once the views of all stakeholders are taken into account.

Right to Information: Non-state actors could play crucial role in public awareness
Non-state actors could play crucial roles in educating and advising the public, requesting information, and monitoring the governments sharing of information,Co-Convener of Indias National Campaign for Peoples Right to Information Venkatesh Nayak said.
He was delivering the keynote address at a lecture entitled Making the Right to Information a Reality in Sri Lanka: The Role of Non-State Actors,to share information on how civil society and NGOs can aid both the government and citizenry in implementing the RTI Act.
The lecture was held at the BMICH yesterday.
Non-state actors can educate the citizenry by holding information fairs, putting on skits, writing songs, especially popular Bollywood songs, and developing pamphlets, Nayak said.
They can also do sample surveys, case studies, and pattern analyses to see exactly how people are using the RTI.
Governments take recommendations for improvement seriously, he said.
Nayak mentioned that once people encounter obstacles in their pursuit of information, many give up for lack of knowledge of the system. To counter this problem, NGOs can set up RTI clinics and provide RTI experts who have experience in obtaining information.
Along with advising the public on how to go about requesting information, non-state actors can also guide the governments rollout of the RTI Act.
Task Forces with civil society representatives have advised governments throughout South Asia. In India, the government respected civil society instructions because it knew the RTI movement was grassroots. And in Bangladesh, district advisory committees are coming up, he said.
Government and civil society can and should work together for the sake of strengthening RTI.

SAARC Anaesthesiologists, Intensivists meet from Feb 24

The College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka will be hosting the 12th SAARC Associations of Anaesthesiologists meeting in conjunction with its own 33rd Annual Academic Congress from February 24 to 26.
The ceremonial inauguration will be held on February 24 at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre with the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.

Of this 58 million people are in the SAARC region.
The Helsinki declaration on patient safety during anaesthesia was a landmark document, in identifying this issue. Patient safety during Anaesthesia has become a global concern, and several initiatives are in place currently in the world to address this issue.
Safe Anaesthesia for Everybody Today by the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiology, Zero preventable deaths by 2020 by the Patient safety movement of the USA,  Safe Surgery Saves Lives by the WHO and Pathway to Safe Surgery by the Royal College of Anaesthetists.
The working agenda of the College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka has been Improving Outcome after Anaesthesia through Safety and Knowledge.
The theme of this meeting is Improving Outcome in the SAARC region
In the context of the prevailing global concern on patient safety during anaesthesia, this years meeting would address safety and quality issues in the SAARC region. Over 70 reputed international speakers from many countries including the SAARC countries will take part in a comprehensive academic programme, complete in educational content. Several workshops would be conducted by international academic institutions.
The meeting is conducted and hosted by the College of Anaesthesiologists and Intensivists of Sri Lanka, headed by its President Dr. Kanishka Indraratna.

Seven potentially habitable earth-sized planets found orbiting nearby star

Astronomers have found at least seven Earth-sized planets orbiting the same star 40 light-years away, according to astudypublishedWednesdayin the journal Nature. The findings were also announced at a news conference at NASA Headquarters in Washington.
This discovery outside of our solar system is rare because the planets have the winning combination of being similar in size to Earth and being all temperate, meaning they could have water on theirsurfaces and potentially support life.
"This is the first time that so many planets of this kind are found around the same star," said Michal Gillon, lead study author and astronomer at the University of Lige in Belgium.
The seven exoplanets wereall found in tight formation around an ultracool dwarf star calledTRAPPIST-1. Estimates of their mass also indicate that they are rocky planets, rather than being gaseous like Jupiter. Three planets are in the habitable zone of the star, known as TRAPPIST-1e, f and g, and may even have oceans on the surface.
The researchers believe that TRAPPIST-1f in particular is the best candidate for supporting life. It's a bit cooler than Earth, but could be suitable with the right atmosphere and enough greenhouse gases.
If TRAPPIST-1 sounds familiar, that's because these researchers announcedthe discovery of three initial planets orbiting the samestar in May. The newresearch increased that number to seven planets total.
"I think we've made a crucial step towards finding if there is life out there," said Amaury Triaud, one of the study authors and an astronomer at the University of Cambridge. "I don't think any time before we had the right planets to discover and find out if there was (life). Here, if life managed to thrive and releases gases similar to what we have on Earth, we will know."
Life may begin and evolve differently on other planets, so finding the gases that indicate life is key, the researchers added.
"This discovery could be a significant piece in the puzzle of finding habitable environments, places that are conducive to life," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. "Answering the question 'are we alone' is a top science priority, and finding so many planets like these for the first time in the habitable zone is a remarkable step forward toward that goal."
And as we've learned from studying and discovering exoplanets before, where there is one, there are more, said Sara Seager, professor of planetary science and physics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Seager and other researchers are encouraged by the discovery of this system because it improves our chances of finding another habitable planet, like Earth, in the future, by knowing where to look.
What we know
The planets are so close to each other and the star that there areseven of them within a space five times smaller than the distance from Mercury to our sun. This proximity allows the researchers to study the planets in depth as well, gaining insight about planetary systems other than our own.
Starting closest to the star and moving out, the planets have respective orbits from one and a half to nearly 13 Earth days. The orbit of the farthest planet is still unknown.
Standing on the surface of one of the planets, you would receive 200 times less light than you get from the sun, but you would still receive just as much energy to keep you warm since the star is so close. It would also afford some picturesque views, as the other planets would appear in the sky as big as the moon (or even twice as big).
On TRAPPIST-1f, the star would appear three times as big as the sun in our sky. And because of the red nature of the star, the light would be a salmon hue, the researchers speculate.
The researchers believe the planets formed together further from the star. Then, they moved into their current lineup. This is incredibly similar Jupiter and its Galilean moons.
Like the moon, the researchers believe the planets closest to the star are tidally locked. This means that the planets always face one way to the star. One side of the planet is perpetually night, while the other is always day.
Based on preliminary climate modeling, the researchers believe that the three planets closest to the star may be too warm to support liquid water, while the outermost planet, TRAPPIST-1h, is probably too distant and cold to support water on the surface. But further observation is needed to know for sure.
How the discovery was made
TRAPPIST-1 barely classifies as a star at half the temperature and a tenth the mass of the sun. It is red, dim and just a bit larger than Jupiter. But these tiny ultracool dwarf stars are common in our galaxy.
They were largely overlooked until Gillon decided to study the space around one of these dwarfs.
The researchers used a telescope called TRAPPIST (TRAnsiting Planets and PlanetesImals Small Telescope) to observe its starlight and changes in brightness. The team saw shadows, like little eclipses, periodically interrupting the steady pattern of starlight. This is called transiting. The shadows indicated planets, and further observation confirmed them.
In July, the team was able to determine that two of the closest planets to the stars had atmospheres that were more compact and comparable to those of Earth, Venus and Mars by observing starlight through the planets' atmosphere.
By using a global network ground-based telescopes like TRAPPIST and space-based telescopes like Spitzer, the researchers continued looking toward the TRAPPIST system and were able to determine the orbital periods, distances from their star, radius and and masses of the planets.
What's next
Over the next decade, the researchers want to define the atmosphere of each planet, as well as to determine whether they truly do have liquid water on the surface and search for signs of life.
Although 40 light-years away doesn't sound too far, it would take us millions of years to reach this star system. But from a research perspective, it's a close opportunity and the best target to search for life beyond our solar system.
"If we learn something now, it can determine if we looked in the right place," Gillon said.
In 2018, the James Webb Space Telescope will launch and be positioned 1 million miles from Earth with an unprecedented view of the universe. It can observe large exoplanets and detect starlight filtered through their atmosphere.
The researchersare also searching for similar star systems to conduct more atmospheric research. Four telescopes named SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) based in Chile willsurvey the southern sky for this purpose.
This star system will probably outlive us because this type of star evolves so slowly. When our sun dies, TRAPPIST-1 will still be a young star and will live for another trillion years, Gillon said. After we are gone, if there is another part of the universe for life to carry on, it may be in the TRAPPIST-1 system.
"This is the most exciting result I have seen in the 14 years of Spitzer operations," said Sean Carey, manager of NASA's Spitzer Science Center at Caltech/IPAC in Pasadena, California. "Spitzer will follow up in the fall to further refine our understanding of these planets so that the James Webb Space Telescope can follow up. More observations of the system are sure to reveal more secrets."

Seylan Bank achieves milestone with Rs 4 bn PAT

Seylan Bank reported a resilient performance recording a profit after tax of Rs. 4,010 million for the year ended 31st December 2016, which is the highest profit reported since its inception.
Net interest income recorded a moderate growth of 12.03% as a result of the strong balance sheet growth. Net interest margin contracted from 4.42% in 2015 to 4.19% in 2016 due to cost of deposits increased at a faster rate.
Net fee and commission income witnessed a 15.04% growth from Rs. 2,697 million to Rs. 3,103 million during 2016, mainly attributed to core banking related business. Other operating income comprising of net gains from trading, gains on financial instruments, gains on foreign exchange and other income decreased by 13.05% from Rs. 1,624 million reported in 2015 to Rs.1,412 million during 2016 mainly as a result of mark- to-market losses on Government Securities, due to the upward movement in interest rates.
Total expenses recorded an increase of 12.76% from Rs. 8,625 million to Rs. 9,725 million. Expenses growth was witnessed by a higher proportion of investments being made towards branch upgrading and refurbishments, continuous development in human resources and technology which resulted in the underlying expenses increasing rapidly over the previous period.
Bank continues to focus on Cost Management through strategic cost management initiatives and through the implementation of lean concepts.
The Bank reported a significant net credit growth of 22.22%, with net advances growing from Rs. 193,104 million to Rs. 236,020 million during 2016. The Gross NPA ratio has also improved to 4.47% in 2016 compared to 4.68% in 2015.
CASA growth slowed down with a notable shift from low cost to fixed deposits seen across the industry mainly due to increasing interest rates. As a result Banks CASA ratio (current & savings accounts) stood at 32.5% and total Time Deposits increased from 63.71% by end of year 2015 to 67.5% as at 31st December 2016 of the total deposit base.
The overall deposit base recorded a growth of 21.79% from Rs. 224,525 Million by end of 2015 to Rs. 273,456 million by 31st December 2016.
Consequently, the Banks Earnings per Share (EPS) grew from Rs 11.11 to Rs. 11.63. The Bank recorded a Return (profit before tax) on Asset (ROA) of 1.76% and Return on Equity (ROE) of 15.18%. The Banks Net Asset Value per share as at 31st December 2016 was Rs. 80.51 (Group Rs 84.13).

SL must recalibrate expectations for private sector

Sri Lanka needs to recalibrate its expectations and push policy makers to get low lying fruits, for the private sector to take off, <U+200E>Frontier Research Product Head and Economist Shiran Fernando said.
He was speaking at a seminar on capital markets 2017, held in Colombo.Sri Lankans have high expectations of policy makers, when we look at from the bottom up, there is no proper expectations on the growth and laws if such things are not properly achieved due to policy uncertainty, people go negative. Commenting on the status of the economy and outlook for 2017,Fernando mentioned that peoples expectations and sentiments on policy makers and economy have been turned off a lot due to policy uncertainties.
Despite the fundamentals moving in the right direction, overall sentiment is depressed, Everyone is still in the negative sentiment framework.
These things need to change and little factors need to go away.
He further added the International Monetary Fund (IMF) package, a more independent Central Bank and Fitch rating outlook revision havent alsoseen positive impacts as yet.
