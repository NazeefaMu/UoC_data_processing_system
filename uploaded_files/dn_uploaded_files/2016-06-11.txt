Trinity-Anthonys in the scrum: who will succumb
Todays schools rugby match between Trinity and St Anthonys at the Pallekelle Stadium at 4.15 pm is part of a home series and it will be interesting to see who will succumb. These two schools are Kandys bitter rugby rivals and the players will throw everything into battle in an effort to win. Last year Trinity was able to beat their rivals by 49 points to 13.
Both schools are undoubtedly smarting after their defeats to Isipathana and Royal in their last outings and will try to make amends this evening.
The stage is set for another enthralling and bruising confrontation. Both schools are seeking to field their strongest possible lineup. Much will depend on how the game is officiated.
This time the two schools are playing in the Division 1 Cup Competition.
The Trinitians are likely to do well in the back division play. They have arguably the best back division line in the hills. They tend to be, faster, more elusive players. Its useful when one knows each others capabilities and uses them accordingly.
The Antonian forwards tend to be knowledgeable and stronger, and they have helped the school get back to Division I after three long years. These forwards when in possession of the ball move it towards the opposition goal-line. Their forwards in the last game against Royal made short bustling runs with the ball against stronger forwards. The Antonian forwards should do well in line outs an area where Trinity is weak.
Todays clash is certain to draw a huge crowd of rugby lovers, in expectation of a grim yet attractive battle for supremacy. Trinity will depend much on skipper Rahul Karunatilake, Thushila Perera, Anuka Boyagoda and Leshan Wijesuriya, Aqtheeb Ramzeen, Nathan Yee, Diluksha Dange, Geshan Pethiyagoda and Sanushka Abeyawickrema. The Antonians will be expecting a lot from skipper Pasindu Dulshan, Shenal Dias, Anjana Ariyawansa, Mohamed Shabeer, Dinesh Rodrigo, Duminda Hettiarachchi, Asanka Maduwantha and fly half and place kicker Dinuk Amerasinghe and Praboda Bandara.
Sports in Kandy at club level needs a fillip
Sports is a significant part in the city of Kandy where Sinhalese, Muslims, Tamils, Burghers, Malays and so many communities have made it their home, including all sports lovers.

Then the other popular sports were netball, badminton, athletics, basketball, tennis, cue sport, volleyball, table tennis, elle, golf, swimming and baseball. Whatever is said and done schools regularly organize sports at top level and they are doing well at all sports they play. Thanks to the Principals and the past pupils Kandy has produced national captains at cricket, rugby, athletes, iron sports, hockey, football, boxing, swimming, basketball etc.

Royal forwards against Isipathana three-quarters
Royal College Colombo will face a tough battle when they face favourites for the title Isipathana College in their Singer Inter-school Division 1 League Rugby Tournament second round match for the Milroy Fernando trophy, which is scheduled to be played at CR & FC grounds, Longdon Place at 4.15 pm today.
The Pathana lads has brought in former centre Randy Silva to play in the pivotal position of fly half at the expense of Malintha Ruberu who is expected to play in the second half if needed and will most probably play in his pet position as fly half.
In the pack, seasoned campaigner Wageesha Weerasinghe will play as number eight alongside their cracking flankers in Sashmitha Fernando and Devin Gunaratne in the third row. Kaveesha Madushan and Sharukh Manabarana have been moved up to the front row to bind down with hooker Hasitha Mapitigama.
The forte of both teams has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal eight especially Ayesh Maduranga, Mohamad Nabeel, Azmir Fajudeen, Harith Lokugamage, Hisham Barrie, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Ashen Fernando, Maleesha Madumewan and captain Gunadheera are expected to give a terrific display in the loose and secure ball position.
If they deliver and get their act together to proceed with the famous rolling maul then the Royalist will have a chance of pulling off this game. However they face a huge challenge from the Pathana forwards spearheaded by their cracking number eight Weerasinghe who will be ably supported by Gunaratne, Lahiru Wishvajith, Kaveesha Madushan, Sharukh Manabarana, Hasitha Mapitigama, Weeratunge and Sashmitha Fernando.
In the set scrums the experienced Royal hooker Fajudeen should get the better of his vis-a-vis Mapitigama, while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Lokugamage together with Madumewan and Isipathana line out jumpers in Weeratunge and Weerasinghe.
Royals new halves combination comprising Wijekumar and Calyanaratne are playing together for the first time this season. Everything will depend on how they will click as a pair in this crucial match. Pathana will hope that their highly talented scrum half cum play maker Harith Bandara will pair off well with his new fly half Randy Silva.
In all probability, young Bandara should try to set his speedy three quarters in motion at every given opportunity, as they have two hard running wing three quarters in Chamod Fernando and Ranindhu Padmasanka together with their skipper and centre Kushan Indunil. This is in addition to the experienced centre cum vice captain Sumudhu Rankothge who has stood out with his powerful runs down the flank as full back Gayan Wickramaratne is there to join the line and form the overlap. They will hope that their new halves combination of Bandara and Silva will hit it off. The halves combination of these two players will have to give a very good performance if Isipathana are to emerge victorious.
Isipathana College (Probable XV)
Kaveesha Madushan, Hasitha Mapitigama, Sharook Manabarana, Lahiru Wishwajith, Adeesha Weeratunge, Sashmitha Fernando, Devin Gunaratne, Wageesha Weerasinghe, Harith Bandara and Randy Silva, Chamod Fernando, Kushan Indunil (Captain) ,Sumudhu Rankothge, Ranindhu Padmasanka, Head Coach Nilfer Ibrahim, Asst. Coach (Forwards) Terence Henry.
Royal College (Probable XV)
Ayesh Maduranga, Azmir Fajudeen or Hisham Barrie, Mohamed Nabeel, Ashen Fernando, Harith Lokugamge, Maleesha Madumewan, Pasindu Amarasinghe, Nikila Gunadheera (Captain), Ashok Wijekumar and Lennox Calyaneratne, Nikil George, Thuleb Hassen, Janidu Dilshan, Andrew de Silva or Shaqir Nawfer , Ovin Askey, Head Coach Sanath Martis, Asst.

S Thomas College Mount Lavinia will once again come under pressure when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season, giant killers Science College Mount Lavinia in their A Division inter-school Singer League rugby championship second round match at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana at 4.15pm today. Science College probably met a real force in their last match against Wesley College last week and finally won by a close margin of 11-7. The story could be the same against the Thomians who are holding back nothing this season as they have won all their matches upto date with runaway victories and threatened the pride of St. Peters College in their last outing where they virtually thrashed them by 36 points to 13 last week.
Referee: Rohan Fernando.

We cannot condone efforts to create problems to Army - Prime Minister
Efforts taken by some interested parties to create problems between the Army and the people living in close proximity to the Salawa Army Camp where ammunition caught fire destroying the whole camp recently could not be approved, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Premier made this observation in response to Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake who made a special statement under Standing Order 23(2) stating that delays in providing relief to the affected had led to protests along the Colombo - Awissawella Road.
We cannot condone such efforts to create problems to the Army, Premier Wickremesinghe said. We are providing all the relief possible to the affected people.
The Premier further said it would take at least 60 days to reconstruct those houses that were destroyed by the fire. He said compensation would also be provided to those whose houses have been partly damaged and not usable. He added that however until the security forces give their approval assuring the security, nobody would be able to reach certain areas.
There could be blasts in such areas and it is the duty of the security forces to give us an assurance that the area is safe, the Premier said.
He further said that nearly 125 contaminated wells in the area have been cleaned up as of yesterday and the rest would be cleaned up soon.  Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakkem pledged to provide 10,000 mineral bottles of water, the Premier said. But the Divisional Secretary needed water bowsers and they have been duly deployed to provide drinking water."
The Premier also said the survey to assess the damages caused by the fire was in progress.
MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said the government should have gone into action immediately to provide relief and assess the damages. He said that people have faced serious issues with drinking water. He also added that the people who were settled in partially damaged houses had no means to prepare their meals. At least there is no procedure formulated to asses the damages caused to their property, MP Dissanayake said. People would not have got on to the streets if there were no issues.

Plans in place to salvage fallen SLTB
A restructure plan for the Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) would be introduced to salvage it, while retaining its ownership by the Government, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the SLTB has a debt burden of Rs 16 billion, adding that the efforts of the Government was to find this money without burdening the general public with more and more taxes.
He pointed out even though the Treasury had been doling out money to the SLTB for many years, it had failed to pay the due EPF payments to its employees. He made this observation as a response to a question raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
MP Gunawardena questioned whether there was a plan to privatize the SLTB, to downsize its staff by 12,000 and to sell the lands belonging to the SLTB. Responding to the question Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva emphasized that the SLTB would not be privatized, but a restructure plan would be put in place to rebuild it.
The SLTB's daily income of Rs 69 million was not sufficient even to cover up the day-to-day expenses. The Treasury had been doling out Rs 1,350 million each month. If not for this money, the SLTB was unable to even pay the salaries of its employees, he said.
He said for the last five years from starting from 2010, employees EPF contributions have not been remitted to the Treasury even though that amount had been deducted from the salaries of employees. EFP arrears stood at Rs 10,250 million when I assumed duties. Now we have brought this amount down to Rs 8,900 million. Since September 2015, EPF contributions of each and every employee of the SLTB have been paid. However, it has faced a severe financial crisis, he said.
He said no employee had been forced out of the institution, but said a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) was now being implemented at the SLTB. We had obtained Cabinet approval in this regard. The VRS is not open for drivers, technicians and bus conductors. At an average, the SLTB has 6 workers for each bus. Therefore it has become hugely inefficient, he said.
The Minister also said the number of depots would be brought down from 120 to 70. He said the lands owned by the SLTB had not been sold to the private sector, but they had been vested in companies fully owned by the Treasury. He also said the Finance Ministry had facilitated Rs 2,500 million to repair 1,000 SLTB buses.

Colombo Port City investors willing to cancel demand of US$ 163 Mn - Alagiyawanna
The Chinese investors to the Colombo Port City project at its initial stage demanded for a US$ 163 million compensation, but had later expressed their willingness to cancel the demand, Parliament was informed yesterday.
Megalopolis Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, made this observation yesterday in Parliament, responding to a question raised by Opposition MP Udaya Gammanpila during the round of questions for oral answers.
The demand was made initially by the investors, but during discussions they had with Sri Lankan authorities, they expressed their willingness to cancel it, the Deputy Minister said. Besides that, we could negotiate with them to grant the 20 hectare land on a 99 year lease basis which the previous government had promised give it outright to them. He said, "so far no fresh agreement had been signed by the incumbent Government with the investors, but the Government might do so in the future. A committee headed by the Secretary to the Prime Minister had already begun negotiations with Colombo Port City investors with an objective of signing a fresh agreement, the Deputy Minister said. I don't agree with Gammanpila's statement that the delaying of the project had discouraged the investors, as the project had been initiated without proper environment reports.
He also said that a fresh environmental assessment had been conducted on the project and the interested persons could obtain it from the Central Environment Authority or from the Parliament Library.

Lands held by Military in NE must be returned - Opp. Leader
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan in Parliament yesterday, urged that all lands held by the military in the North and East should be immediately returned to its civilians.
He was moving an adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday. He said he met with the President and Prime Minister to discuss this matter, who showed that they were agreeable to release the lands.
Seven years have elapsed since the end of the armed conflict in the country. Many Tamil people in the North and East, who were displaced during the war, were yet to be resettled in their original lands. They have been prevented from coming back to their original lands as those were either occupied by the military or not released by the military, he said.
The President is to visit Jaffna shortly and he would have meetings with both civilians and Military officials with regard to the release of lands in Jaffna, he added.
He also complained that even though assurances were given last year that most of the prisoners held under the PTA would be released, only about 50 persons had been released on bail, while the others continue to languish in prisons.
A structured programme is necessary to enable the displaced people to meaningfully rebuild and recommence their lives. Immediate action should be taken to reverse, rectify and redress several actions that have adverse political economic, social and cultural consequences to the Tamil people and thereby impedes genuine and meaningful reconciliation and evolution of permanent peace in the country on the basis of justice and equality, he noted.
We are at an important juncture today. Reconciliation among communities is the prime need of the country. A change in Government occurred in January 2015 and it had been strengthened by forming a national government. Structurally, this was the first major step towards reconciliation. However, the people are discontented as reconciliation in the proper sense was not visible yet. This was not to say the Government has done nothing, but much more could have been done in the time that had elapsed to bring about a favourable change, he commented.

Army camps in the North should not be removed to resettle the displaced people in the North, Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said.
He was joining in the adjournment motion moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan on problems faced by the people in the North and the East.
We have no dispute on resettling the displaced people. It is a humanitarian issue. However, we do not agree to the argument of the Opposition Leader that these people must be resettled in their original lands by removing the Army camps. There are many unused lands in the North, he said.
The MP said by the end of 2014, about 21,000 Army personnel had been removed from the North.
Northern Province Chief Minister C V Wigneswaran had stated yesterday that the Army should be completely removed from the North. He has become a joker. What if all the other chief ministers in the country also request the same Where are we going to accommodate the Army he said.
Commenting on why the military presence in the North is required, the MP said, After the end of war about 12,000 ex-LTTE cadres had been released after rehabilitation. They can bear arms again and we have past experiences in that regard. So they must be under the Government's surveillance.
Many LTTE combatants fled during the final stage of war. They never surrendered. We still recover suicide kits and weapons in the North. The State apparatus had collapsed in the North during the period of war and those responsibilities were being carried out by the Army. Still, the Army has some contributions to be made in these state affairs, he said.

France based company to construct 65,000 houses in North - Minister Swaminathan
The 65,000 houses to be constructed by the France based company Arcelor Mittal Construction in the North, having a minimum lifetime of 70 years and the company had already given a 30 year guarantee, said Prison Reform, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Affairs Minister D M Swaminathan.
He was replying to an adjournment motion moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan concerning the problems faced by the people in the North and the East.
These houses will be of international quality. The cost of Rs 2.1 million is not just for a basic house, but a fully furnished house with all facilities. This project would definitely raise the living standards of the people of Northern and Eastern provinces. According to the expertise report of the Peradeniya University, the prefabricated housing construction programme would not involve local labour or resources and the construction period would be comparatively less, he said.
The Minister said his ministry had received a total of 97,232 applications from the people of the North and East for the Houses to be constructed under this project. In Jaffna district, we have received 32,050 applications for the housing project. A total of 97,232 applications have been received from Jaffna, Vavuniya, Mannar, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara, he explained.
The minister said Rs 154 million have been allocated to provide optional lands and to construct permanent houses to people in the Mannar District whose lands are in the possession of the Armed Forces.
Our Ministry has allocated Rs 14 Billion to resettle and rehabilitate the people of the North and East who have been victimized by the 30 years long war. Under the funding of the Ministry, 10,030 permanent houses are being built in 11 Districts, including several districts in the North and East. Rs 647million have been allocated to facilitate drinking water to 11 war affected districts.
In the Northern and Eastern Provinces, 2,400 war-damaged houses were renovated at a cost of Rs 480 million. Rs. 418 million had also been allocated to improve sanitation facilities of 7,600 families. Rs 632.7 million have been allocated to develop the infrastructure facilities in resettled areas, he said.

He was responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday.
In Parliament, former President Rajapaksas vote is only another one vote, but he is a great personality and an exclusive citizen of this country. His vote must be special. It is useless to ask for his presence in the House, if his vote cannot change the final result. He did not vote at the previous budget as well. If you see former President Rajapaksa in the House for a vote, it will be a critical moment that signs the shift of political power, he said.

NCM against Ravi meant to send strong signal to Govt. - Dinesh
The main purpose of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake was meant to send a strong warning signal to the government and that purpose was achieved successfully, MEP leader Dinesh Gunawardena said.
He was addressing a press conference at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday. He said the Joint Opposition (JO) had no hope of winning it, but, used the debate to expose the the governments financial mismanagement.
Forty eight NCMs had been presented to the Sri Lankan Parliament, but only two had been successful. However, during the debate of the NCM, some of the Government ministers were also on the same page with us on some of the issues we pointed out. The Government did not receive the support of the JVP and TNA.
Eventhough the Government defeated the motion, they did not go home with a relaxed mind, he said. He also pointed out that the Government failed to find the two-thirds majority in Parliament to defeat the motion.
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila said the JO could accomplish four main purposes from the NCM. They were exposing the corruption, fraud and inefficiency of the Finance Minister, exposing the dual role of the SLFPers supporting the Government, exposing the TNA for nor performing the role of the main Opposition and creating a new culture where the JO and JVP can work together.
MP Bandula Gunawardena said the Government had so far released over USD 4 billion to the market to maintain the value of the rupee at 148 compared to the dollar.
The total amount of the IMF loan was USD 1.5 billion. This is nothing compared to the seriousness of the foreign exchange issue. The foreigners who invested in state treasury bills are withdrawing their money. Over the past one and half years the foreigners had withdrawn Rs 153 billion, he said.
The MP further said there was information that the data on the Central Bank computers was going to be deleted to conceal the Treasury Bond scam. He said CB Governor Arjuna Mahendran should be responsible for these issues, adding that many in the Government itself including the President are of the view that Mahendran should be removed.

No one can split SLFP
No one or no group will be allowed to split the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and no such action will be tolerated, Petroleum industries Minister Chandima Weerakkody and Higher Education State Minister Mohan Lal Grero said.
They added that the SLFP was a shattered party until 1994 and therefore the party suffered a lot. In accordance with the lessons learnt from the past, no one is allowed to destroy the SLFP.
The ministers were addressing the media yesterday in Colombo.
Minister Weerakkodi said the persons, who crossed over to the SLFP from the UNP are in the front line of the joint opposition.
If one thinks that a SLFP government can be formed by dividing the party, I dare say that such a person is badly mistaken.If one induces others to split the SLFP, he or she is carrying out a contract of the United National Party (UNP), he noted.
However, the SLFP will work to form a SLFP government at the next general election, the Minister said. He added that the government is working on creating a people-friendly constitution that is most suitable to the country. Besides, the government is working on strengthening the countrys economy. These are the prime concerns of the government. As pledged by this government, everyone is experiencing freedom and other democratic rights now.
State Minister Grero said the members of the ruling party of the last government were aware that the country was heading towards a severe economic crisis.
I suppose, that was the very reason for the previous government to go for an early election
Minister Grero added that the SLFP and UNP members should work cordially with good understanding to take the country forward.
People of the joint opposition should understand that protecting the government is none other than protecting the SLFP.
He added that economic sanctions would have been imposed on the country if the good governance government did not come to power.
The formation of the Good Governance government is not an attempt by the UNP or the SLFP to prop up or subjugate each other but to work for the common good of the nation and its people, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Dewapriya said.
However, there should be a proper mechanism to create a SLFP led government by 2020 by winning the next General Election, the Chief Minister said.

Making a special announcement in Parliament, he made this observation and said that the Secretary General had already expressed his regrets to him (the Speaker).
The Speaker also observed that a mistake in counting the votes taken in Parliament had happened in many other places in the world. He added that it was wrong for some MPs to interpret the recent voting fiasco in Parliament as the first such incident of its kind.
The Speaker said that there had been three earlier occasions of vote counting mistakes in our Parliament. Such mistakes had been rectified later. In the Parliament of Great Britain, there had been 11 such miscounting incidents.
The Speaker said that he had received the committee report appointed by him to investigate the mistake of voting in Parliament on May 5, 2016.The committee comprised Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa, Urban Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem and Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
According to the report, the error in counting occurred because of MPs coming to the Chamber at various times while the vote was being taken. The MPs had come into the Chamber at three separate occasions while the process of vote taking was in progress. The officials had included late comers too and there had been a human error and a mistake occurred in that process.
However, there had been no deliberate intention to distort the vote results.
The Speaker said that the committee was of the view that during the last few months the conduct of some MPs had been unruly, aggressive and hostile.
The committee in its report under the subheading general observations says:
If there will be a continuation of this kind of conduct, there will be an erosion of public confidence reposed in Parliament and the democratic system of governance. Such a situation might eventually eat into the vitals of the democratic principles and norms. Hence the committee recommends that
stringent measures should be taken to uphold the discipline and to maintain the decorum of Parliament.
The committee recommends that the issue is a noteworthy matter to be resolved, by a discussion at the party leaders meeting in the interests of the parliamentary system. If no consensus is arrived at, in considering circumstances under which the uncertainty has arisen, we recommend to hold a fresh counting vote.
When a bill or a resolution is presented to Parliament, the Minister in charge of the subject concerned (including the officials) shall act in due diligence and appraise the House with clarity the nature and the purpose of the Bill or resolution.
The ringing of Division Bell to indicate the voting of members must be continued for five minutes.
When voting had been fixed at a particular time, the House shall not commence voting before the fixed time even if the debate is concluded.
House may be adjourned till the time fixed for voting.
At the time of voting, in the absence of the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker shall preside and conduct the voting in the House.
Members of the Speakers Panel shall be given a special training to develop their skills.
Officials of Parliament shall not engage with MPs or any outsider to evaluate or examine the conduct in the House or any other related matter unless there shall be a direction from the Speaker.
Stringent measures should be taken to uphold the discipline and maintain the decorum of Parliament.
The existing Standing Orders may be revised appropriately to meet the above mentioned requirement.
Speaker Jayasuriya said that he had received a written apology from the Secretary General of Parliament.
The Speaker also said that MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Sisira Jayakody met him and appologised over their conduct and behavior at the time of incident, the Speaker said.
The Speaker emphasised that the cooperation of all MPs was needed when a vote in Parliament was taken and the Board of Secretary General too should take utmost care in counting with the assistance from the Chair.

Jayalalithaa writes to PM Modi, seeks release of 21 TN fishermen
A day after six more fishermen were arrested by the Sri Lanka Navy, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to get 21 fishermen and 92 boats released from the island nation, including those apprehended on June 9. "This is to bring to your notice yet another incident in which six fishermen, in one mechanised fishing boat from Rameswaram were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy in the early hours of June 9 and taken to Thalaimannar," she said in a letter to the Prime Minister.

She said fishermen faced threats of harassment and abduction from Sri Lankan Navy while fishing in their traditional fishing waters in the Palk Bay. "I would like to remind you that 15 fishermen apprehended earlier this month are still languishing in Sri Lankan custody. 91 fishing boats are also in Sri Lankan custody at present," the Chief Minister said.

Non-release of boats by Sri Lanka caused immense frustration amongst fishermen and throttled their livelihood though the island nation freed arrested fishermen, she said. Seeking Modi's personal intervention, she urged him to take up the issue with Sri Lanka in a "concrete and decisive" manner so as to secure the immediate release of "our 21 fishermen and 92 fishing boats, including the six fishermen and their one mechanised fishing boat apprehended on June 9 at the earliest."
