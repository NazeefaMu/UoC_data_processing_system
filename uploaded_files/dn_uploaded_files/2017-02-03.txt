Almost perfect South Africa rout Sri Lanka
Durban: South Africa captain AB de Villiers hailed an "almost perfect performance" after his team crushed Sri Lanka by 121 runs in the second one-day international at Kingsmead on Wednesday.
He singled out Faf du Plessis and David Miller, who both hit centuries as South Africa recovered from a poor start and piled up 307 for six after being sent in on an unusually dry, slow Kingsmead pitch.
Du Plessis (105) and Miller (117 not out) put on 117 for the fifth wicket off 136 balls after South Africa had been struggling at 108 for four. South Africa's total always seemed likely to be too many for the tourists to chase and so it proved, as Sri Lanka were bowled out for 186, giving South Africa a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.
"It was a fantastic effort by Faf and David, an incredible partnership after being four down early on," said De Villiers. The batting was backed up by good bowling and lively fielding.
Sri Lanka made a quick start, with Niroshan Dickwella and Upul Tharanga putting on 45 for the first wicket off 46 balls.
But both openers fell to outstanding catches, by Du Plessis and De Villiers.
"They played well in the first ten overs and took it to us. But we have a lot of class in the bowlers and we picked up wickets at important times," said De Villiers. Sri Lanka captain Tharanga rued the failure of any of his batsmen to make more than Dinesh Chandimal's top score of 36.
"There were lots of twenties and thirties but nobody went on," he said.
Tharanga said the stand between Du Plessis and Miller was the biggest difference between the teams.
"We took four wickets but Faf and Miller had a very good partnership. If one of our batsmen had gone on and made a big hundred maybe we could have chased it down."
De Villiers said South Africa had worked hard on taking their chances in the field after missed opportunities let them down when they lost a recent Twenty20 series.
"You don't get that many chances in white ball cricket. When you do you have to take them."
Largely due to Du Plessis, South Africa maintained a reasonable scoring rate despite losing their first four wickets cheaply, with none of the four batsmen dismissed able to reach 20. The left-handed Miller initially reined in his normal attacking instincts as he and Du Plessis made steady progress against an assortment of accurate slow and slow-medium bowlers. The partnership ended when Du Plessis was caught at long-on after facing 120 balls and hitting seven fours and a six. AFP

Dayasiri skews Viggie and defends Executive Presidency
The statements made by Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneshwaran affects severely to the unity and reconciliation between the Sinhala and Tamil communities, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday.
He also said that his statement was highly questionable as Vigneshwaran was a Supreme Court Judge in Sri Lanka.
The Minister was speaking at a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters.
He added that most of the ministers including him had nurtured have kept on the unity between the communities and on reconciliation. When Vigneshwaran makes haphazard statements, how could we talk to people in the South, the Minister said. If he was to make such statements, we too would have to think twice on the proposed Constitutional amendments.
These types of statements are made to appease LTTE supporters and the NGOs, the Minister said. These statements would be an invitation to Sinhala extremists to raise their heads. He questioned as to what would happen when powers are vested in Provincial Councils and the Executive Presidency is abolished it would allow politicians such as Vigneshwaran to stir communal sentiments.
He added that the ordinary Tamil Community does not need anything that Vigneshwaran was asking for and they only need to live peacefully under one country.  So I think the people in the North have to take action against him, the Minister said.

Human snake girl sheds her skin every two months
A teenage girl who sheds her skin every two months because of an ultra-rare condition has been cruelly likened to a human snake.
Shalini Yadav, 16, needs to constantly smear her body with moisturizer to stop it from hardening and seizing up.
The youngsters family are so poor they cannot afford that and need to spend their money on providing food for eight people including her grandparents.
The Indian teenager had been thrown out of school because of her extraordinary appearance.
Doctors have diagnosed Erythroderma, an inflammatory skin disease also known as red man syndrome, but are unable to treat it. It causes the skin over almost the entire body to become scaly and flake off.
Shalini has shed her skin every 45 days since she was born.
She has to soak her body in water every hour - night and day - and smear himself with lotion every three hours to prevent drying out.
Her desperate mother Devkunwar said: Shalini is suffering from the disease since childhood. We saw several doctors but none of them could cure her and her condition has continued to get worse. I feel so helpless when I see her skin coming off, causing excruciating pain to my child. This disease is not killing her but taking her life bit by bit. We have no idea where to go to and who to consult.
Devkunwar, a care-giver in a state-funded community centre, is so heart-broken she says death would be kinder to her daughter.
She added: It is better to die than living a life of misery.
Shalinis two siblings Sejal, 15, and Price, eight, are normal with no such complication.
Her father Rajbahadur, a daily wage worker, said: Its really sad because she was not born normally and has scaly skin all over her body. It is similar to being severely burnt, from the sole of her feet to her head.
Shalini said: I wanted to study but they threw me out of school as the children would get scared by seeing my face. Everybody in the family is suffering because of my medical condition. But what is my fault What sin did I commit to be cursed with such a disease. I want to live. Please help me, if you can. Mirror

Accused Tamil human smuggler granted bail

A Sri Lankan man accused of bringing hundreds of Tamil asylum seekers into Canada illegally has been granted bail after more than six years in jail.
A B.C. Supreme Court judge ruled on Thursday (2) that Kunarobinson Christhurajah does not have to remain in custody while awaiting a new trial over allegations of human smuggling.
Last week a jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case of Christhurajah, who is accused of organizing the voyage of the MV Sun Sea, a rickety cargo ship that transported 492 Tamil asylum seekers from Thailand to Canada in August 2010.
The jury found three other men not guilty.
Christhurajah's wife, Mary Patrishiya, sobbed outside the courtroom after learning the result of the bail hearing.
"I have no words," she said, covering her tear-streaked face with both hands.
"I'm going to hug him," she added when asked about the first thing she would do when she saw her husband.
Christhurajah's six-year-old daughter was with her mother outside court on Thursday. The girl was born months after the couple arrived in Canada aboard the Sun Sea.
"Nobody here. No friends. No family. I was pregnant. I had hardship the last six years," his wife said. "But I forgot everything in this moment."
The criminal trial against the four co-accused began in October and lasted four months.
The Crown argued Christhurajah was the owner of the Sun Sea based on evidence that he rented office space in Bangkok in 2008 and 2009 under a fake name on behalf of Sun & Rashiya Co., the company that officially owned the vessel.
Christhurajah's lawyer told the trial there was no evidence his client profited from his actions and the Crown had failed to prove he hadn't acted for a humanitarian purpose, the Vancouver Sun reported.
Lawyers for Lesly Emmanuel, a fellow Sri Lankan, and Thampeernayagam Rajaratnam, a Canadian, argued their clients had acted on humanitarian grounds, which meant they had not violated the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
A 2015 Supreme Court of Canada ruling, which also stemmed from the MV Sun Sea, struck down human smuggling legislation in the Criminal Code, arguing it had become "overbroad" and could be interpreted to apply to humanitarian workers and family members of asylum seekers.
The lawyer for Nadarajah Mahendran, also a Canadian, argued his client was the victim of misidentification that resulted from shoddy investigative techniques on the part of the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency.
Christhurajah's bail conditions include to keep the peace, to report weekly to a bail supervisor and to refrain from contact with any of the three co-accused with whom he stood trial. He has also been ordered to pay a $10,000 recognizance.
Outside court, Christhurajah's lawyer said a new trial date has not been set for his client.

Announcement on Hambantota port project soon
An announcement will be made by the Government shortly in connection with the Hambantota Harbour project. The Cabinet Sub Committee met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday in this regard, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said. Addressing a press conference at his ministry office in Colombo yesterday Minister Karunanayake said that although various parties present various ideas about Sri Lankan airlines, none of these are the views of the Government. Various parties express various opinions. Some who cannot even run a bus try to fly air buses, he said.
According to Minister Karunanayake although some accuse the Government for not developing the country, the Government has already implemented several development projects without any noise. The Government has commenced construction work of seven highways but the previous Government constructed only two or three highways. It also constructed a large number of schools, hospitals and rural roads.
Minister Karunanayake referring to an article published in a Sunday newspapers about Rosewood said what the Finance Ministry did was respond to a request made by the customs and made arrangements to obtain good bids for the Rosewood. Everything done by the Finance Ministry is transparent and always followed by an open dialogue.
Now the Government has passed the explosive situation of the economy which existed at the time the new government came into power. The volcanic situation is over now. The Government will correct the non strategic assets and not always aim at revenue gaining. Sri Lankas economy will navigate safely through this troubled times. The previous Government obtained money but did not deliver. What we do is legalize things. It is easy to walk with thieves than stopping them. Even before the RTI Act was passed, the Finance Ministry was practicing it. The new US President is doing what is good for the US and we have to do what is good for our country. Otherwise we have to remain under pressure, he added.

Back to nature  in a setting fit for royalty
Juliet Coombe discovers why Jetwing Kaduruketha Hotel is unique amongst the Jetwing Hotels chain as there are no TVs in the rooms and you are truly able to immerse yourself in a luxurious agro haven that is both naturally and historically fascinating.
At Kaduruketha you can immerse yourself in the experience without the distractions of the modern world and learn a great deal about living with nature and the local village peoples traditions.
Cashew nut
You are also assigned a butler who is from the area and takes care of all your needs during your visit. In this way you can really build a rapport with them and get increasingly deeper insights into whatever your interests might be. I was fortunate enough to have Eranda as my butler, who spoke excellent English, knew a great deal about the hotel and the surrounding area, and was also a great singer, to boot, who treated me to a few impromptu numbers while he gave me the Agro-tour.
Well the Agro-tour is a must. It is nothing to do with getting pent up energy out of your system, though it might well help, rather it is about being at one with nature, through developing wisdom and understanding of the trees, the fauna, the plants and the people. There are 55 to 60 different trees growing in the hotel grounds of which 40 to 50 can be used for food and/or medicine while 5 to 10 for doing away with yourself or your deadliest enemy!
Eranda first takes me round the back of the hotel to see some of the most common vegetables grown for the daily restaurant menu in the garden nearest the kitchen. Im treated to neat rows of capsicums, chilis, ladies fingers, brinjal (a purple courgette type vegetable sliced into many dishes), beans, drumsticks (no, not chicken legs but long beanlike brown pods), carrots, green beans, gotacola, lettuce, tampala (ornamental and spinach like vegetable for salads), and nivithi (spinach for dhal curry). As we then move onto the trees else where we pass a shiny black Asian forest scorpion trying to pass us unnoticed.
Less symmetrical beds
We move on back to the front of the hotel with its wonderful mountainous backdrop and I am shown less symmetrical beds of chillis, capsicums and drumsticks, all very enticing, the last of which are cooked with gravy and are good for joints and bone marrow. I glance over to a mango tree overlooking the field, currently being ploughed up by an old tractor for the next rice crop. I ask about the wooden makeshift ladder tied to a high branch, thinking it might be an aid for picking mangoes not in accordance with health and safety guidelines. When the elephants come the farmers climb up the tree to launch firecrackers at them to keep them away, Eranda tells me with a broad grin. I imagine how much fun that would be for a youngster but also wonder that it might not necessarily be so respectful of the sacred elephants! I remembered at Jetwing Vil Uyana they allowed the elephants to completely ransack the vegetable garden without so much as a whimper of regret for all those hours of grafting, only to have to reap croquet sized elephant dung balls in place of yams.
Nostalgic feelings
Looking across the field we see the tractor and plough being followed by about twenty worm-seeking Cattle Egrets, which make me nostalgic for my farming days, where normally it was seagulls but once I had 17 buzzards following my plough. Eranda brought me back from my reverie, to wax lyrical about the Tamarind tree, a very large specimen that yields toffee, fruit and vegetables for fish curry, chutney, and chicken between February and April. It seems that a lot of the fruits go through a stage when they can be picked as vegetables when green, with a very different taste, and then fruit if allowed to fully mature, such as with Jak and Papaya. In this tropical paradise there is always plenty on the menu when you have so many to choose from with differing harvest periods and cycles. The climate lends itself to harvesting all year round.
We also spot some Muniya birds perching in this tree, which look very pretty to me with their yellow breasts, black heads and tuneful songs but Eranda is quick to point out that they are a pest owing to eating the rice in large numbers. My innocent half smile turns into a fitting half grimace as I get one step closer to being a natural initiate of this prolific oasis. Eranda then points out the Forget-me-nots and tells me, with a glint in his eye, that the first tours were named after these pretty little blue flower clusters.
As we pass two superbly placed accommodation huts with views of the fields and hills behind, Erandas face lights up as we reach a 15 year old laden palm tree that stops us in our tracks. Toddy! he tells me. And Jaggery! I respond, remembering the delicious sweet treat that this unrefined sugar is, like a full dessert in itself. He then picks up a small branch and fashions it into a whip and explains, We use it for hitting the wood to scare off snakes, like cobras, that might be sleeping here during the day; they are most dangerous when surprised i.e. woken suddenly from sleep. We have come to a couple more wooden chalets with views to die for where Eranda whacks away at the timber with his new whip. Even when no one is in there, it is a good idea to keep the snakes away! Without warning, and probably after thinking about toddy and its ability to erase memories, Eranda waxes lyrical about his lost love and breaks into song. He tells me he is the singer for the local band then sings, with a beautiful sad and unselfconscious voice, a whole verse of the locally famous Thanivela (Only me), lamenting his lost greatest all time love. I tell him she cant be worth it if she has ditched him as I have spent enough time with him as both a guide and child-minder to know he is a prize catch for some lucky lady.
Green unripe peppercorns
We then walk on to the ubiquitous black pepper groves, which consist of albicia trees with pepper vines growing profusely up their trunks. Eranda picks of a strip of green unripe peppercorns, passes me a few then munches on the rest. I try them too out of curiosity and am amazed at how strongly they taste and keep chomping to see if the heat dissipates with time; it gets worse of course but I persist as I remember how good pepper is at clearing out the system when you have a cold, in combination with lime juice, salt, honey and boiling water. Eranda, having got his woes off his chest with his first sad song, then breaks into a happier song for dancing called Rajamalige, and a song for mothers Ameria. This is just one of the added bonuses of having Eranda for a guide though I must confess I did not ask him to sing any special requests so leave that to his next lucky client.
I am treated to a host of other visual and learning delights including the Pawatta, used for reducing fevers and general strengthening of the body; Amarello for vegetable and fruit juices, and cooking in curry; Kohomba for face washes, soap and shampoo which we have a go at making; Nelli trees for fruit and medicine; a one hundred year old cashew tree, cinnamon and guavas.
So, whether you want to learn more about all the flora and fauna in Sri Lankas natural gardens of eden, want to know how to keep well or live fast and die young, like walking around the grounds of the most beautiful agro hotel in Sri Lanka or are happy to listen to a knowledgeable guide speak and sing local songs, the Agrotour is an absolute must with Eranda when visiting Jetwing Kaduruketha Hotel. Of course, there are many other great adventures to be had here, too and the reason so many people want to stay longer and return sooner.

Barriers or failures : Is the spirit of entrepreneurship missing in Jaffna
It is one of the biggest trade fairs to come to Jaffna. Over 60,000 people have visited the 350 stalls in the three days the Jaffna International Trade Fair was held last week. The crowds thronged the stalls, admiring the merchandise and indulging on all the food stalls, few however have made use of the opportunity to build trade links and improve their businesses. The answer is simple- there are few entrepreneurs left to invest.
Rajneesh Mehrish and Amandeep Azad
The Trade Fair held in partnership with the Associated Chamber of Commerce (ASSOCHAM) brought in 65 Indian companies to look at the possibility of tying up with Jaffna based entrepreneurs, but many left disappointed.
This is the first time India is taking part in the fair on such a scale, said D. S. Rajora, one of the organisers from ASSOCHAM. He was optimistic with the potential for trade in the region and said Indian companies which had been limited to Colombo were willing to do business directly with Jaffna.
Rajora has suggested that the Jaffna Chambers help create a more entrepreneurial environment and build a solid base in Jaffna, If they do that, we can ensure whoever comes to Colombo will also visit Jaffna. With very local industries to invest in, the companies have been limited to appointing their agents or distributors to sell their goods.
Indian businesses who are looking for a long term market for their goods are keen on seeing local industries develop but as Goyum Screw Press, Director (Marketing International), Harish Singla puts it, The spirit of entrepreneurship is missing in Jaffna.
Harish Singla
They also found out that most businesses in Jaffna were run by traders and not entrepreneurs. Most source their business from Colombo. The exporters are also from Colombo. The local agent has no decision making power, said Amandeep Azad from Azad Engineering company and queried as to why the local man made no effort to cut out the middleman.
The answer, according to Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industries of Yalpanam (CCIY), K. Vignesh lay in the fact that airports and ports in Colombo were controlled by exporters from Colombo. It is easier to sell to the middlemen from here. If we have an airport in Jaffna, we can break that dependence, he said and added, Why should we go 400km to export it
The excruciating 8-13 hour journey to Colombo or to the nearest functioning port or airport simply added to the list of reasons as to why it is hard to get business moving in Jaffna.
The potential for joint investments in various fields are limited due to logistical issues. The government of Sri Lanka has to address this, said Rajora and he suggested that at least the ferry service from Thalaimanar be opened to make goods transportation from India faster.
Azad quipped that the option of opening up Palali Airport would also make things easier, If that is opened, we would take just five hours to set up rather than eight, he said.
Rajneesh Mehrish who sells medical equipment added, If the government wants to develop Jaffna, they have to take measures to connect it with India better. It is too far to come from Colombo, we are wasting time. Connectivity with India must be smooth.
The call for greater connectivity with India is not a new request and many have advocated for proposals such as the building of a road to opening up Kankesanthurai (KKS) Port and Palali Airport to make it easier to trade with Jaffna.
The Indian remarks are echoed by Vignesh, We have asked the government to open up Palali and KKS. This is not a new concept, it was always there. They should at least open it up for domestic freight, he said.
At present however, only Sri Lankan Air Force flights which operate from Palali Airport and while Indian companies and other local private companies have been called to apply, Vigensh pointed out that the landing and taking off fees were too high for commercial cargo to operate in.
As the crowds concentrate around jewellery and food stalls, Azad has had very little business. The small scale agricultural machines he was here to sell have not had much of a market. He blamed the lack of purchasing power amongst the local populace for the low sales.
We see that coconut in Jaffna is Rs 34 but in Colombo it is Rs 44. They send the coconuts to Colombo, where it is processed into oil and sent back to Jaffna at a much higher price. We must follow the Chinese concept of making the factory where the source is, observed Azad.
People want small machines, it is a lucrative market but few here have the purchasing power for it. There needs to be micro level financing for the industry to grow at a much faster pace, he added.
Financing and micro financing in particular is not the problem in Jaffna. Vignesh pointed out that over 350 finance companies were catering to a population of 650,000 in Jaffna.
Dr. Muttukrishna Sarvananthan in his research paper, The Pains of Labor in the Post-Civil War Development in the City of Jaffna, Northern Province, Sri Lanka highlighted that the banking density was highest in the Northern Province among the nine provinces in the country. He explained that there was an over-supply of banking services along with high levels of indebtedness among the Northern population.
Vignesh in turn highlighted that most of these companies concentrated on providing finance to buy commercial goods rather than investing in businesses and industry, We have also found that accessing government financial aid has not been easy and that has limited growth, he said.
Where is Jaffnas economy headed
Dr. Sarvananthans research showed that The Provincial GDP of the Northern Province had grown remarkably in 2010 and 2011 but decelerated in 2012 and 2013 after the end of the civil war in 2009 (statistics only available up to 2013).
This immediate spurt in growth fueled by pent-up demand for consumer goods and services in the Northern Province reflects the Eastern Province where the provincial economy recorded 33% growth in 2008 (the year after the end of the civil war in the East in 2007) and then decelerated in the subsequent years, he added.
The main areas of growth were in the sectors of: other food crops (which includes red onions and chilies), fisheries, construction, domestic trade, transport, banking, insurance, real estate, and government services (including defense and public administration).
Vignesh also explained that while there were around 700 industries in Jaffna, most were small and medium scale enterprises,
We have about 2-3 big industries in the Acchuveli Industrial zone, they specialize in hardware, he said. His organisation has around 300-375 active members with around 65-70 being female entrepreneurs.
The main issue he perceives is the lack of value addition in many of the fields including fisheries and agriculture.
Where are the jobs
When it comes to unemployment Dr. Sarvananthan pointed out that between 2011-2014 most jobs have been found in relatively lower paid elementary (54%), clerical (32%) and sales and service workers (28%) as their bases were higher with very few available to take up more professional (24%) and technical employment (30%).
The Northern Province, including Jaffna district, is lagging behind not only in terms of the quantity of employment created, especially in relatively higher paid jobs, but in the quality of new employment created as well, stated Dr. Sarvananthans research.
In addition, Vignesh also pointed out that many families live on foreign remittances and hence their children expected higher salaries. They wont work if the salary is low, he said.
Dr. Saravananthan speaking to Daily News also explained that the lack of entrepreneurial skill was also due to the fact that many famed for their entrepreneurial skills had left Jaffna during the conflict,
The islanders, those from Velanai, Kytes, Delft and Poongudithivu are very good at business. But they migrated over time. In the last two years however we have seen an upsurge in Diaspora spending on private investments and on consumer goods, he said. Vignesh added that even though they had the physical infrastructure, they lacked the human resources to follow through. As a result many have had no option but to bring in labour from outside to fill in higher paying jobs- a consequence not liked by many in Jaffna.
We need steady growth, then we will be able to cope with the boom, said Vignesh.
More importantly they have also had problems in attracting employment into the private sector.
The government has always been the main employer in this region. It is only after the war that the private sector has come in and it is hard for the community to accept that and adapt, said Vignesh.
Mechanization
The Chamber is also working on promoting the adoption of technology into many businesses in Jaffna so that they can grow faster,
Most of our shops still operate manual systems. The Mudalali spends countless hours writing from morning to night. They have to be told what is out there, said Vignesh.
This is a phenomenon Azad too noticed and he said that many may not be interested in the machines due to not having seen one in real life.
People havent seen much industry here. They will understand better if they see it for themselves, he said and has proposed that the next Trade fair make arrangements to bring down working models for demonstrations.
Governance
He compared Jaffna to what India was like 50 years ago, We had the same problems, but in the 1970s, we had government officials who would push and nurture entrepreneurs to help them come up, said Azad.
Vignesh too would prefer to have a more proactive government supporting business and he observed that there needed to be a change in mindset among government servants before any improvement can be made.
The government (both provincial and central) has been lethargic and alienated from the private sector. We are conducting awareness programmes to make them more aware of the needs of businessmen, he said.
Many have also come to feel that those from outside of Jaffna receive preferential treatment compared to local investors,
Many investors from outside come here with all the permission and approvals, it is harder for us to get them. At times have to go all the way to Colombo, said Vignesh.
In the Acchuveli Industrial zone, the infrastructure is bad. If the basics are improved upon, our people are ready to take it on, he added.
Acchuveli also has the problem of location. Neither the airport, port nor a main highway exists in its immediate vicinity, making many industries reluctant to invest there.
International Trade
At the end of the day however, convincing locals to invest in industries has not been easy. Vignesh sadly remarked that on a recent visit to Canada, he found Jaffna curry powder made in Kerala, India.
Dr. Sarvananthan was of the opinion that traditional industries which existed before the war would no longer be able to compete with a more open economy.
Many of the products can be bought for cheaper prices from India or China. The global economy has changed but the structure of ours hasnt changed much, said Dr. Sarvananthan.
We need a knowledge based service. The Indians can have BPOs here as we also speak Tamil. We need to change our industries. Rather than trying to go back, added Dr. Sarvananthan.
For India, investing in Sri Lankan businesses, especially in the North is of geopolitical importance, especially as China steadily infiltrates the market.
We have done well in Sri Lanka but the Chinese are beating us the world over. Their products are cheaper and look better than ours. Ours maybe more expensive but it will last longer, observed Singla.
India thus has become a willing source of investments into the North as it desperately looks to improve its economy.
If society is to improve, we need industries to come here. Keep the youth occupied if you dont want them to fight, said Vignesh.

Benefit of rice price reduction should go to consumer: Ravi
The benefit of rice price reduction should go to the consumer as planned and all hidden rice stocks should be put into the market immediately.
One kg of rice was priced at Rs. 76 after reduction, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He was addressing a press conference at his ministry in Colombo yesterday.
The minister said the price of one kg of rice should be Rs. 66 once the Trade Ministry announced the new price after the President and the Prime Minister took steps to reduce the price from another 10 rupees on last Friday. It is up to the Trade Ministry to announce the new price. It is effective 12.00 noon, January 27.
According to the minister, private traders will import 23,800 metric tonnes of rice from Chennai shortly, and the price should be definitely reduced according to the several measures taken by the government. Only a handful of traders purposely increase prices artificially.
The media should help bring down the prices and to give intended benefit to the public.
One kg of Sudu Kekulu (white raw), Rathu Kekulu (red raw) and Naadu rice can be easily sold at Rs. 65, he said.

Better research useful in formulating laws and policies: Minister
Better research is useful in formulating laws and policies, Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The minister was addressing a gathering at the inauguration ceremony of the Colombo Law Faculty Legal Research Unit.
Throughout history, justice ministers were making the law without connection of the Law Faculty.
They were only analysing and criticising. Usually, the Attorney Generals Department and the legal draftsmen are given a limited time to formulate laws on adhoc basis. In future, the research unit can contribute when taking policy decisions and in formulating laws, he said. The minister said measures were being taken to make changes to the Criminal Procedure Code and the Penal Code.
Many issues of law reforms come up and as there is no proper research done, it is very hard to solve them. If proper researches are done, then discussions on them can be made and laws can be passed for the peoples benefit, he said.
He said people are also losing confidence on law and order. Policies should not be formulated without proper research as it is not a good practice.
Speaking about the proposed amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, the minister said that allowing lawyers to access suspects before trial would cause disturbance to relevant investigations.
The Research Unit will benefit all Sri Lankans and it is of historical importance, he said.

Bhagavad Gita, manual for life
Living is an art, skill and technique that needs to be learnt and practised. The Bhagavad Gita enunciates the ancient philosophy of Vedanta and presents the eternal principles of life and living which transcend race or religion.
The principles equip one with a strong intellect to meet the challenges of the world and achieve success and peace in all aspects of ones life  official, social and domestic. Above all it ushers one towards ultimate perfection, the goal of spiritual enlightenment.
Chapter XVIII of the Gita defines sannyasa renunciation and tyaga relinquishment. A detailed analysis of the causes, incentives and constituents of action follows. The different aspects of action are further classified into the three gunas, qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. It helps one to assess ones personality and determine spiritual development.
The study of Bhagavad Gita helps to purify ones personality and attain the ultimate goal of Enlightenment, a state of total fulfilment. Bhagavad Gita is systematically taught at the Vedanta Academy, Pune, India. The Academy was founded by Swami Parthasarathy, a world renowned Vedanta philosopher and management resource. The Academy offers three years full time residential course on Vedanta philosophy. The youth from all over the world with diverse cultural backgrounds study at the Vedanta Academy and learn the technique of life and living. The alumnus of the Vedanta Academy conduct Vedanta study classes, workshops and organise public lectures in different parts of the world. The same three year course is also available through E-learning.
Sunandaji the daughter  disciple of Swami Parthasarathy has been studying and researching on Vedanta, for over three decades. Her clear and powerful presentation of the Bhagavad Gita in contemporary thought has been acclaimed in India and abroad. Sunandaji has also addressed prestigious corporate organisations and universities worldwide on the practical application of Vedanta in daily life.

Blue Ocean Group unveils Rs 1.4 bn Layards Road project
Blue Ocean Group of companies has invested Rs. 1.4 billion to build their newest condominium project, the Blue Ocean at Layards Road, Colombo 4.
Blue Ocean Group Chairman S.Thumilan said they have already sold 20 apartments at the ground breaking event yesterday. We see a great demand for quality apartments built by reputed companies and this is the reason we invested for this project.
He said that they will complete the 14 storey luxury condominium complex in 18 months and is confident that all 50 apartments will be sold out by the end of the year.
Thumilan said there is an apartment boom and he forecasts around Rs. 6,500 billion or nearly US$ 43.3 billion high-value sector projects to take off the ground in Sri Lanka in the next five years. He said that the recent budget proposal allowing foreigners to own free hold land and also purchase apartments under five floors will also lead to more FDIs to the country.
It will also help to convert Colombo city into the investment nerve-centre and economic hub of South Asia.
Overall, optimism reigns high in Sri Lanka in particular and in Asia Pacific in general, with capital inflows into our economy expected to increase during 2017, providing a much-needed boost to the countrys burgeoning property industry.
Thumilan said that an increasing number of purchases are through repeat customers or referrals channelled through existing customers. (DJ)

BOC expands portfolio management  services to corporates,trust funds
Q:Why does an investor need a dedicated Portfolio Manager
A: It is basically for four reasons. Firstly, busy customer may not have enough spare time to find the best alternative for their investments. Secondly, as a premier financial institution BOC has more access to frequently changing financial market information which is not widely available to ordinary clients. Thirdly, investor can have hassle free environment due to non-involvement in documentation. Fourthly through proper diversification of client's assets, investors can earn something more than investing in traditional deposits.
Q: Is there any difference between your new service and investing in Unit Trusts
A: Yes. Unit trusts pool all the funds of investors and give the same return to all. But with BOC PMS, investor can enjoy higher returns through tailor made investment mix depend on their risk appetites. Other difference is investors are aware of where their funds were invested unlike in Unit Trust.
Q: Is there a minimum tenor for the agreement
A: The minimum tenor for the agreement should be two years. Otherwise BOC is not in a position to generate progressive return. Higher the investment and longer the tenor gives investor more opportunities to enjoy higher returns according to their risk appetite.
Q: How strong is your investment management team
A: Our portfolio management team consists with well qualified and experienced fund managers. They have international exposure in our overseas branches such as London and Chennai. Also they continuously deal with various types of investment instruments. Also we have experienced research analysts who examine the market information.
Q: When do an investor get their returns
A: Investment returns/ income could be received at the end of agreement or as agreed terms at the initial discussion.
Q: What are the investment instruments you are going to offer to the third party clients
A: There are list of instruments including Government Securities, Treasury Bills & Bonds, Fixed Deposits, Repo Investments, Debentures, Commercial Papers, Unit Trusts, Shares and Asset Backed Trust Certificates.
Q: Is there any particular reason to select BOC as their Portfolio Manager
A: Yes. BOC has the highest public trust with over One Trillion deposit base. It is the largest and strongest commercial bank in the nation with 100% state ownership. In addition, BOC is a leading player in treasury operations. We have experience in managing our own funds for a long time.
We do various research prior to investments. Many people have difficulties in investing their funds and have requested us to manage those. Currently, we are the only state owned commercial bank to fulfill their requirement.

Brexit plan published in government White Paper

The government has published an official policy document setting out its Brexit plans.
TheWhite Paperlays out the government's 12 "principles" including migration control and "taking control of our own laws".
Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK's "best days are still to come", outside the EU.
Labour said the document "says nothing" and had been produced too late for "meaningful" scrutiny.
The White Paper's publication comes after pressure from MPs across the House of Commons.
It sets out the themes of the government's goals for its negotiations with the EU, as announced by Prime Minister Theresa May last month.
These include:
Trade:The UK will withdraw from the single market and seek a new customs arrangement and a free trade agreement with the EU.
Immigration:A new system to control EU migration will be introduced, and could be phased in to give businesses time to prepare. The new system will be designed to help fill skills shortages and welcome "genuine" students.
Expats:The government wants to secure an agreement with European countries "at the earliest opportunity" on the rights of EU nationals in the UK and Britons living in Europe.
Sovereignty:Britain will leave the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice but seek to set up separate resolution mechanisms for things like trade disputes.
Border:Aiming for "as seamless and frictionless a border as possible between Northern Ireland and Ireland."
Devolution:Giving more powers to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as decision-making is brought back to the UK.
The document says the government will "keep our positions closely held and will need at times to be careful about the commentary we make public", with MPs offered a vote on the final deal.
Labour is calling for a "meaningful vote" that could send the prime minister back to the negotiating table if the deal is deemed unsatisfactory by MPs.
Formal negotiations can begin once the UK has given notice of Brexit under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which Mrs May has promised to do by the end of March.
On Wednesday evening MPs voted to allow the PM to do this as they backed the European Union Bill by 498 votes to 114.
MPs will discuss the bill in more detail next week when it reaches the committee stage in the Commons, and Labour has vowed to force through amendments.
Hundreds of amendments have already been tabled for debate between Monday and Wednesday, with objectives set out in the government's strategy expected to attract more.
A total of 47 Labour rebels voted against the bill.
Longer holidays
A chart on page 32 of the Brexit White Paper has raised a few eyebrows by claiming UK workers are currently entitled to a generous 14 weeks of annual leave.
It comes in a section comparing employment rights in the UK with the rest of the EU.
According to the government, the correct figure for someone working five days a week is 28 days.
The slip perhaps reflects a possible rush to publish the White Paper with metadata on the file suggesting it was still being worked on at 04:15 GMT.
Shadow cabinet members Rachael Maskell and Dawn Butler quit the party's front bench shortly before Wednesday evening's vote, and in total, 13 Labour frontbenchers voted against their own party position which was to support the bill.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said other parties had also been divided on the issue, with two of the Liberal Democrats' nine MPs abstaining despite orders to oppose the bill.
McDonnell said a decision on whether frontbench rebels could remain in their jobs would be taken "in due course", and that the atmosphere in his party was "one of mutual respect", with determination to oppose a "reckless Brexit".
He said Labour "may look divided" but would unite after the government triggers official negotiations under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty while "the Tory Party will split apart".
McDonnell also said shadow home secretary Diane Abbott had missed the vote because she "wasn't very well".
'Calibre judged'
The Brexit bill was published last week, after the Supreme Court decided MPs and peers must have a say before Article 50 could be triggered.
It rejected the government's argument that May had sufficient powers to trigger Brexit without consulting Parliament.
Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent, said a "sizeable" Labour rebellion could grow further if amendments were not passed.
The SNP, Plaid Cymru and seven out of nine Liberal Democrats opposed the government's bill, alongside Tory Ken Clarke.
The SNP's foreign affairs spokesman at Westminster, Alex Salmond, said there would be "detailed questions" about the bill during its next stage.
He said "the calibre of the government will be judged by how they respond to the amendments".
Clarke, the only Conservative MP to defy his party by voting against the bill, said the result was "historic", but the "mood could change" when the "real action" of negotiations with the EU starts.
Exit talks with the EU are expected to last up to two years, with the UK predicted to leave the 28-member organisation in 2019.

Call to halt Wilpattu forest vandalism
The forest destruction of the surroundings of the forest areas of Wilpattu, is still taking place, Convener of the Parisarika Ekamuthuwa Ven. Paahiyangala Ananda Sagara Thera said.
A slight decrease of the forest destruction rate can be noticed, but it has not been completely halted since the persons engaged in the forest destruction are still carrying it out as usual.
The Thera was addressing the media yesterday in Colombo.
According to the Ven. Sagara Thera around 3,400 acres land extent of the forest reserve has already been cleared and invaded.
The affected area is situated close to the Northern boundary of the Wilpattu reserve.
The People who are responsible for this forest destruction level allegation against us that they do not clear Wilpattu forest reserve.
It is true but they are continuously clearing the forest areas of the Marijjakattu, Vilachiya and a few other forest areas the Thera said.
Sajeewa Chamikara of the Parisarika Ekamuthuwa said that the direct intervention of the government is vital to protest the forests and wildlife of the country.
He further said that several money motivated so called environmentalists are trying to dilute this massive forest destruction while leveling baseless allegations.
According to them, there were human habitats in the forest areas, which has been cleared.
Actually there were colonies or human settlements in these forest areas during the last centuries.
"It is only a move to justify this massive forest destruction, Chamikara said.
According to him around 700 hectares of the country's forests is subjected to deforestation annually resulting a huge environmental impact.

Ceylinco Life launches  Life Insurance Week
An annual, country-wide campaign to widen the life insurance net through interaction with the masses gets underway on February 11, when Ceylinco Life launches its Life Insurance Week (LIW).
The life insurance leader said it plans to deploy some 4,500 sales people from 260 branches at a series of activities and engagements in key towns and villages in a concerted effort to take the message of life insurance to the grassroots.
In its 10th edition, Ceylinco Lifes 2017 Life Insurance Week will focus on the theme that the cost of waiting to buy life insurance is too high. Using a simple yet effective illustration, the company will demonstrate that buying life insurance sooner rather than later can result in significant savings in premium payments.
Among the activities planned by the company to engage with its target audiences are regional town storming programmes in 40 locations around the country to create better awareness of the importance of life insurance; special screenings of some of the latest movies at eight cinemasin Anuradhapura, Ja Ela, Kurunegala, Galle, Ratnapura, Ambalangoda, Jaffna and Batticaloa; and art competitions in some of Ceylinco Lifes own branches.
The penetration of life insurance is around 13 per cent at present and our objective is to increase this figure by educating people on the value of the protection it offers, Ceylinco Life Director/Deputy CEO Mr Thushara Ranasinghe said. The Life Insurance Week programme has been an effective way of reaching out to the masses, and has generated higher than average sales of policies during the campaign period.
He said the Life Insurance Week initiative supports Ceylinco Lifes Vision which is To take the message of life insurance and Retirement Planning to every Sri Lankan and provide protection to every family.
The market leader in Sri Lankas life insurance sector since 2004, Ceylinco Life has close to a million lives covered by active policies.

Reconciliation, springboard for a better future:
Proper time and effort leads to more secure future:
As Sri Lanka sets up its reconciliation processes, it is important that all groups who were affected by the civil conflict are represented therein. Many argue that inclusion should not only be open to ethnic and religious factions but also to children.
To that end, the Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM) and the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF) jointly hosted a panel discussion on Tuesday evening at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute entitled The Role of Children in Reconciliation: Lessons from International Experiences.
Over the course of two hours, the panel of six international experts engaged in a wide-ranging conversation on the challenges and opportunities that reconciliation processes present and noted that, if properly conducted, these procedures could help unite the country and heal old wounds.
Its such an opportunity you have before you, and it can bring the country together. We are very excited to be part of this, to listen and learn from your experiences and to support you in any way that we can, said Saudamini Siegrist, Global Senior Adviser, Child Protection in Emergencies, UNICEF.
That being said, she added that it is the Sri Lankan government and citizens who should shoulder the responsibility for deciding on the proper methods through which to carry out the reconciliation mission.
The international community should have a supportive role and should not impose from the outside. It should listen to and support your agenda. In order for transitional justice to be meaningful, it must be grassroots.
There are many options for these processes and no one size fits all. Its up to the government and people to look at the national context to determine which processes are most fitting for the country, she said.
Dr. Cheryl Heykoop, of Canadas Royal Roads University, echoed Siegrist, arguing that the reconciliation process must be contextualized in the national situation so as to have the best chance to be consequential for the people.
While the group brought different perspectives to the table, they agreed that including children in the Sri Lankan reconciliation process will be incredibly important. They did caution, however, that the transitional justice procedures will likely be long and arduous.
Id like to say that transitional justice processes are long-term projects. The point is that you have to find a stable way to conduct them so that the state is committed to helping and society is involved. Cooperation is key to maintaining sustainable success, said Iris Marin Ortiz, Presidential Advisor on Human Rights, Colombia.
Colombia has been doing this for more than twenty years, and we have just started, she added.
Siegrist concurred, and added that, though a long-lasting procedure, it is a crucial one: Reconciliation is an urgent process because children cannot wait. We have to address these issues and bring children into the process as urgently as we can.
Indeed, the panelists cautioned that, since so many people see truth seeking and reconciliation procedures as both a means of closure and a springboard for a better future, civil society and government must properly manage the publics expectations for the processes.
Its critical to manage expectations and to make sure expectations are realistic and realizable so that we dont have dreams that cant come true. We should have a (continuous) reality check throughout the process, said Siegrist.
Managing expectations is easier said than done, as countless people will expect different things from the truth telling and reconciliation mechanisms. Despite this, the experts maintained that people should be patient and understand that every one of these processes is different from its predecessors and therefore somewhat experimental.
All of these processes in any country are experiments. Theyve usually not been done before. The importance of looking at other places while recognizing that every situation is different can be useful, said Caitlin Reiger, a lawyer who works for the British Council in Myanmar.
Notwithstanding the daunting challenges that Sri Lanka faces in successfully reconciling its divided masses, every panelist argued that one of the processes keys would be the inclusion of children and the promotion of justice for the young who suffered during the civil conflict.
Children in reconciliation efforts
The challenges innumerable children faced during the conflict, coupled with the fact that the young, by virtue of their relative vulnerability to abuse, often suffer more than older people during emergencies, makes it very important that they are well represented in the reconciliation processes.
They should be, according to several of the panelists, included in the processes and given the opportunity to speak and tell their stories in hybrid and traditional courts. They must not, however, be expected to take on the lions share of the burden of reconciliation, according to Siegrist.
Despite that many people have considered the testimony of children to be unfit for a court of law, the experts argued that this is simply not true, as Reiger said that children can be effective and useful witnesses when called upon.
What is necessary is to hear their voices and engage in a process that allows them to express their views.
And we have done this in many countries, where we have gotten childrens active participation as witnesses in providing testimony, sometimes giving statements in truth commissions, taking part in traditional processes and restorative justice processes, and participating in reparations programmes, Siegrist said.
While lauding the inclusion of children in reconciliation mechanisms, she also noted that the government should work to protect children who choose to participate in the reconciliation process.
It is essential that we take the precaution that childrens participation actually does strengthen their protection and does not expose them to further harm. It has to put in place procedures that safeguard youths participation.
Every step of the way, we need to make sure that what we do is in the best interests of children. Thats the principle. It is paramount, fundamental, and should guide everything we do, she said.
For the experts, accountability helps both communities and children heal and leads to a more secure future. Though it does take time and effort to properly engage children in reconciliation processes, it is very much worth it, as there is evidence that participation makes people become active citizens in the future.
The panel did, moreover, recommend that the reconciliation procedures be flexible enough to accommodate the desires of a vast number of people, as only those who are comfortable with the mechanisms are likely to participate.
Heykoop, in her prior experiences working in Africa, said that young people were almost always keen to share their experiences, but that many of them had very specific desires for what the mechanism would look like.
Siegfried, for her part, recounted how, in Sierra Leone, children insisted that they told their stories in the way they experienced them and that they would be left uncensored.
This actually helped empower them and gave them more agency and a more dynamic role in the proceedings, she said, while adding that this strategy would be part of a larger method of including people so as to make sure nobody feels isolated.
On the subject of prosecuting child soldiers, Reiger argued that children should be held accountable for the crimes they commit, but that they should always be considered victims first.
I think the limitations of a formal justice process suggest that it is perhaps better to deal with the liability of children through other transitional justice processes.
Even if children have committed horrendous crimes, and should have some form of responsibility, they are still first and foremost victims, she said.
Ending cycles of violence
The panelists also spent a significant amount of time discussing the need for reconciliation to help end cycles of violence. Many countries go through reconciliation and truth seeking projects only to fall back into civil strife, and the experts cautioned that any proper mechanism would try to educate the public about the need to come together and end infighting.
Friedrich Affolter, a Global Education Specialist at UNICEF, emphasized the importance of both telling different sides stories and studying conflict in general in order to put cultures of violence to rest.
Transitional justice could benefit from education if we manage to explain to young people why conflicts occur. If we focus on how the education system is used to connect people rather than to divide people, we can make progress towards building peaceful societies.
Conflict can grow if we successfully dehumanize and devalue the other side. Education can stop this destructive process by teaching about conflict, he said.
Other members of the panel echoed Affolter, saying that it was crucial to dispel rumours that certain groups believe about their former adversaries.
Finally, the panelists noted that it is of the utmost importance for society to be compassionate during the proceedings especially because of the sensitivities surrounding the issues.
Ultimately, everyone, not only judges and witnesses, needs to be aware and sensitive when the country designs a child-friendly constitution or court process so that the mechanism has the best chance of succeeding, Reiger said.

Children more secure in school than with parents: President
Children are most insecure while they are in the care of their parents and they are relatively more protected during their time under the guardianship of the school, President Maithripala Sirisena Said in Galle.
He was addressing the Galle District convention of the Southern Province Mothers Health Club Federation (Maw Saukya Samaja Sammelanaya) at the Galle Siri Dhamma School yesterday.
The President was the chief guest on the occasion.
According to information spread in society through the media the children have become more unprotected during their time at home under the care of parents. They are not so unsafe while they are at schools under the custody of teachers.
The highly competitive life styles of parents have led to this pathetic situation of children. Due to the economic struggle the parents have to face they overlook their obligations towards their children.
Hence the children of today are quite insecure under their parents custody President observed.
Recent police records on child protection also provide proof to the fact that they are unsafe in the hands of their mothers and fathers for parents have become less responsive to their young sons and daughters needs and ambitions. In such a situation the Mothers Health Clubs Federation can render a great contribution to correct this situation, President added.
President Sirisena hailing the Mothers Health Club movement said that it was a highly rewarding and constructive undertaking that should be introduced to other provincial Councils of the Country.
The Southern Province Mothers Health Club movement is a highly beneficial programme. I was delighted to observe that these clubs render a very significant contribution to the society under the guidance and support of government health sector. It helps to carry the state health messages to the society. The programme should be nationally recognized and implemented throughout the country. It helps to ensure a healthy and strong family unit which will lead to the countrys economic and social prosperity, the President observed.
Addiction to drugs and alcohol is the major contributor for poverty and many economic evils of society. Mothers who are organized under Mothers Health clubs can take the massage of importance of being free from all kinds of drug addiction. I urge the mothers to contribute their share to build a country free of drugs and narcotic.
Mothers can do much for the welfare of the society. In our great Sri Lankan culture and heritage the mother bears a prominent place. Mothers should take the lead for the prosperity of the family. Many progressive and productive moves can be implemented through mothers organizations.
The Presidential Secretariat has initiated a new programme to ensure the protection of children ,President Sirisena further observed.
Southern Province governor Dr.Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywaradane, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijyalal De Silva and Southern Province Chief Ministry Secretary Saman Dharshan Padikorale also spoke.
Ministers Gayantha Karunathilake and Chandima Weerakkodi , Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, Galle district parliamentarian Wijepala Hettiarachchi and a number of provincial political leaders were present.

Act impartially on two MSD security officers
I was shocked and amazed to hear how the guardians of the law, the police have acted so despicably, sexually harassing a female Russian tourist on the Mount Lavinia beach recently. The Russian tourist has complained to the police, patrolling on the beach, the two police officers who belong to MSD squeezed her buttocks. What a shame for the police of Sri Lanka!
The Police and the Armed Forces should be exemplary, good mannered and should, protect the public from nefarious acts being meted out to them. Instead these two police officers have acted in a noxious way belittling our country. Further, they have proudly confessed to the Sub Inspector and the Constable who inquired them that they too have been from the Police and argued against the questioning.
Their confession reveals us as they were police officers what they had done was legitimate and they were above the law. The two errant police officers were severely drunk and attacked the Sub Inspector and the Constable and tried to escape from the scene. Fortunately they were nabbed by the Police with the help of the navy.
While thanking the Police and the Navy for arresting them I very earnestly and sincerely urge the IGP to take stern action to these shameless MSD security officers impartially, without showing mercy, considering they belong to Ministerial Security Division.

Colombo Courtyard, travellers choice
Colombo Courtyard has been announced a winner of the 2017 TripAdvisor Travellers Choice Awards for Hotels, ranking in its top 1 percent, and as one of the top 25 hotels in Sri Lanka, TripAdvisor stated.
For the 15th year, TripAdvisor has highlighted the worlds top properties based on the millions of reviews and opinions collected in a single year from travellers around the globe. Winners were identified in the categories of Top Hotels, Bargain, B&Bs and Inns, Luxury, Service and Small Hotels. The hallmarks of Travellers Choice winners are remarkable service, quality and value.
TripAdvisor is one of the worlds top review sites. Used as a platform for guests and clients to voice their opinions on places they have visited, the site offers a chance for people to see an organization from the perspective of its clients, rather than from the perspective of the hotel itself. With an increase in the trend of customers looking for more real views on products and services, rather than classic forms of marketing, a TripAdvisor review can potentially make or break a business.
This is Colombo Courtyards second consecutive Travellers Choice Award, though the Hotel has been awarded TripAdvisors certificate of Excellence annually since its inception.
We are humbled to be recognized in the top 1% of Sri Lankan Hotels two years running, says Arun Thapar, Managing Director of Colombo Courtyard.

Despite another dismal show: Ford sees improvement
DURBAN: Even after a 121-run loss in the second One-Day International against South Africa in Durban on Wednesday (February 1), Graham Ford, the Sri Lanka coach, stressed on focusing on the positives. After the hosts posted 307 for 6, Sri Lanka were shot down for 186 with no significant resistance coming from any of their batsmen.
"For some of the guys it's a bit of a jolt to come and see how tough it is to play in foreign conditions and to play in South Africa," Ford said. "From that point of view, it's got to be a learning opportunity. If we are realistic and we look at the players we've got and the ages and the amount of games they have played, it is about learning and it is about improving. At times we've shown improvement, at times I have hoped for more improvement. On tonight's performance, I was quite excited about what I saw.
"Unfortunately none of our batsmen converted starts but they certainly showed they have got the talent to play at this level and to make an impact at this level. I feel when I look at the number of games so many of them have played and the ages of some of them, if they are looked after and shown the right kind of support, in time, they could be a very good Sri Lankan side."
However, Ford was quick to point out that there's still a lot of work that needs to be done and they need to work out the balance of the side. With the Champions Trophy approaching in England, teams will have to battle tough batting conditions.
"It's pretty clear there is a lot of improvement that needs to take place," he pointed out. "From what I saw from some of these young batsmen, they showed they can handle this sort of bowling attack.
"Conditions in England might not suit them as much as today's conditions so we will have to do a bit of thinking about balance of side and the way we can try and disrupt them in those conditions but we will have to improve a lot in all three disciplines."
Sri Lanka will now travel to Johannesburg to keep the series alive before heading to Cape Town and Centurion for the last two games of the tour. They've been jolted severely with the absence of Angelo Mathews, who has been ruled out of the tour with an injury. To add to that, the form of Dinesh Chandimal hasn't helped the team's cause either.
"In white-ball cricket, Angelo is a fantastic allrounder. He is the leader of the group so it is a setback but if I look at where we are at, it gives us a chance to groom a couple of other guys in the set-up and hopefully it will pay us back down the line," Ford said about Matthews.
"In recent weeks, he (Chandimal) has started to look a lot better, started to time the ball and shown he is not far away. He started this tour a little under-done because of that serious finger injury but we all know what a capable player he is. He will get one score hopefully in the next game and hopefully he won't look back."
Miller out of Sri Lanka series

Hard-hitting batsman David Miller will miss South Africas remaining three one-day internationals against Sri Lanka because of a finger injury, Cricket South Africa said on Thursday.
Miller, who hit 117 not out in South Africas 121-run win in the second match in Durban on Wednesday, injured his right little finger when he dived in attempting to make a catch in the outfield during Sri Lankas innings.
Team doctor and manager Mohammed Moosajee said Miller would be out of action for between seven and 10 days. He will be available for a tour of New Zealand later this month.
The third one-day international against Sri Lanka is on Saturday in Johannesburg.

Djokovic, Kyrgios in lead roles at star-stripped Davis Cup
Paris: Novak Djokovic and Nick Kyrgios hope the Davis Cup heals the wounds of their painful Australian Open exits this weekend when they will be the only two men in the top 15 taking part.
World number one Andy Murray has opted out of Britain's trans-Atlantic trip to Ottawa where Canada will be without fourth-ranked Milos Raonic for the World Group opener.
Meanwhile, Australian Open champion Roger Federer and world number three Stan Wawrinka miss Switzerland's tie in the United States.
Rafael Nadal, the runner-up to Federer in Melbourne, will sit out Spain's match in Croatia, who will be missing Marin Cilic, while Japan and France meet in Tokyo with Kei Nishikori, Gael Monfils and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on the sidelines. Tomas Berdych is out of the Czech Republic team to face Australia in Melbourne while David Goffin skips Belgium's short hop to Germany.
Just as worryingly for the 117-year-old tournament is Juan Martin del Potro sitting out defending champions Argentina's home tie against Italy. Despite seeing all of his Grand Slam rivals take a breather, world number two Djokovic -- stunned in the second round in Melbourne by unheralded Denis Istomin for his earliest exit at a major in nine years -- is relishing leading 2010 champions Serbia against Russia in Nis.
"I am overjoyed to be back amongst these guys as we are all close friends and it's a very special atmosphere every time we get together," 29-year-old Djokovic told daviscup.com.
"But Russia are a young team and we can't underestimate them."
Russia, who won the last of their two titles in 2006, will be led by world number 52 Karen Khachnov. A win for Serbia will set-up a quarter-final against either five-time winners Spain or 2005 champions Croatia who meet in Osijek.
In the absence of Nadal, Spain will be led by 16th-ranked Roberto Bautista Agut and Pablo Carreno Busta, the world 26. Croatia, however, have to rely on Franko Skugor and Nikola Mektic, ranked at 223 and 319 respectively, neither of whom have ever won a Davis Cup singles tie.
At Kooyong in Melbourne, number 15 Kyrgios will try to restore his battered reputation after being accused of tanking in his five-set, second round loss to Andreas Seppi at the Australian Open. Australia, the 28-time champions, face a Czech side led by world number 54 Jiri Vesely in the absence of world number 12 Berdych.
"I've got to improve a lot of things in my game, I've got to work harder," said 21-year-old Kyrgios.
For Great Britain, Murray dropped out the Canada tie after his shock fourth-round defeat to Mischa Zverev at the Australian Open. World number three Raonic is missing after injuring his groin in his quarter-final loss to Nadal.
With top 50 players Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund, Britain will be favourites as Canada's top singles player is Peter Polanksy, ranked at 128.
The winners of that tie will face either Japan or nine-time champions France in the quarter-finals. Japan are missing fifth-ranked Nishikori, who was bothered by a hip injury in his defeat to Federer in Australia.
In his absence, Yoshihito Nishioka, ranked 85, leads the Japanese challenge against a French squad who can still boast Richard Gasquet and Gilles Simon, both inside the top 25. AFP

Dwarf family
A rare genetic condition has made nine of the 11 members of a family dwarfs. Ram Raj Chauhans clan once consisted of 21 people - 18 of whom suffered from a genetic condition called Achondroplasia which causes short limbed dwarfism.
Achondroplasia is the most common form of disproportionate dwarfism, and is characterised by a normal sized torso and short limbs.
Ram Raj, 52, originally had seven sisters and four brothers, with eight of the 11 siblings suffering from the condition. But some of them have passed away, including his elder brother, Prithvi Raj.
Ram Raj now lives with ten of his family members in the Old City in Hyderabad, India. Nine of them have the condition, making them the largest dwarf family in the city.
Their condition attracts a lot of attention, much of it unwanted. Curious looks, verbal jibes and taunts are a common occurrence when the family steps out.
Ram Raj explained: If we go out, people crowd around us and ask us strange questions like, Why are you so short, Where are you from. Everyone teases us.
There are health issues as well. Due to the shortness of their legs, walking can become a problem.
Ram Raj explained: After a certain age, the legs become weak. I have seen my grand father and my father face this, but they still managed to walk properly. But I have difficulty in walking and my younger brother cant walk without help. Same with two of my sisters.
Ram Raj works as a Marriage Welcomer, where he dresses up and welcomes guests to weddings, but finding employment has proved challenging for the family.
He said: No-one was willing to give me a job. I have faced a lot of problems because people look at me and say, How will you manage I work at my relatives grocery store when I dont have the wedding work to do.
His 27-year-old daughter Ambika wants to be an accountant but as she also suffers from this condition, she has also found it difficult to find work.
She said: In the future I want to become an accountant but this will only be possible if Im able to get a job. People tell me that because Im short, thats why Im unable to get a job.
The other members of the family who are of short stature, including Ram Rajs brothers and sisters, also find it very difficult to get steady work.
He said: My younger brother works in a telephone booth and my elder brothers wife is a tailor. We manage this way.
Ram Raj believes life is particularly tough for the females in his family.
He said: It is still ok for the male members of the family. But what about the women in my family who have this condition Life is much more difficult for them.
Ram Rajs wife was of normal height but sadly passed away in 1993 while she was seven months pregnant with their third child.
Ram Raj says that even though people laugh at them, and the condition makes it difficult to travel, get married and lead a regular life, the family believes God has given them this condition because they are special.
He said: My father once said that this is the dwarf incarnation of the Lord. People may laugh, but we shouldnt feel bad about it.
So many people have teased me and other members of the family. But if someone is sad and, by looking at us they get to laugh, its Gods will that we are the ones making them laugh.
I have two daughters, says Ram Raj. I try and make them understand by saying that this is their duty. And you can make it work. God is with you. Mirror

## Title: On the edge of a precipice

On the edge of a precipice
The pot of water is boiling. The crab in it is swimming, oblivious to the predicament that awaits it. The predicament of our people and the country at the present juncture also looks similar.
We are on the edge of a precipice. The economy is in disaster mode. The fact is we are a heavily indebted nation. In fact it has been so for some time. In 2015 our total external debt was US dollars 44.8 billon. A leading economist disclosed at a seminar this week that debt commitments would double in 2019. It is a scenario that is dreadful even to think of.
Politicians are blaming each other for this state of affairs. There seems to be a competition to disown the responsibility for the debt among the present and former rulers. In fact it did not appear overnight. By the time the new Government came our foreign debt had risen to 54.4 percent of the GDP. New debts were added to that burden in the last two years. We are caught in a vicious circle from which it is hard to extricate ourselves.
Foreign exchange earnings
The only way to ease the debt burden is to increase foreign exchange earnings. At present they are insufficient even to ease balance of payments difficulties. That is why the government has been dependent on foreign loans and grants. With Sri Lanka graduating to a low level middle income status concessionary loans are not forthcoming. Hence, the recourse to commercial borrowings at relatively higher costs. It is an unwholesome practice. Hence, the significance of the export-promotion strategy.
However, it is easily said than done. Exports could be increased only as a result of undertaking development projects which require a large infusion of capital and technology which has to be sought overseas. Thus foreign investments as well as foreign collaboration become a sine qua non of development.
However, Sri Lanka has been unable to attract sufficient foreign investments so far. Total foreign investments in 2015 were less than one percent of the GDP. Besides, it is a moot point whether even the meagre investments that came were utilized productively or spent on consumption.
Though we pursue an export oriented policy of development, the low level of productivity makes our commodities less competitive in the world market. Hence, the benefits of export promotion are hard to obtain. This necessitates the development of technology for which scant attention has been paid so far. Our expenditure on Research and Development (R & D) are insignificant and is one of the lowest, if not the lowest in the region.
Another alarming situation in the economy is the shortage of labour both skilled as well as unskilled. As a result it has become imperative to import labour despite the prevalence of considerable unemployment in the country. This factor is often forgotten or unknown to many who oppose immigrant labour on principle.
Developing countries
Besides these economic factors there are other factors, especially political that has driven the country to a precipice. Main among them is the inability to ensure national reconciliation and durable peace in the country. The wounds of a three-decade old fratricidal war have not been healed. In addition racist forces are on the offensive due to the lethargy and indifference of the Government and progressive forces. This endangers political stability which in turn deters the flow of foreign capital investments necessary for development. Hence, communalism is a self-destructive course even for its adherents. The estrangement of the different national communities and its escalation has the potential of the country degenerating into civil strife which would inevitably lead to the curtailment of democratic freedoms won and the development of authoritarian tendencies.
To make matters worse international economic and political situation is also less conducive to the development of developing countries such as ours. Difficulties faced by economies of metropolitan countries affect those in the periphery. Brexit, escalation of conflicts in the Middle East, likely surge in oil price all would have adverse reactions on our economy.
As a result cost of living will escalate and life would be terrible for the masses. Only the rich and the super-rich would be able to withstand the growing inflation.
In this dire situation politicians of almost all hues are merrily fighting over petty issues taking the people as hostages in their bid to maintain or regain political power. At a time when concerted efforts and synergies are necessary to pull the country out of the precipice internal feuds in the consensus Government is a major drawback to progress.
Political parties
Whatever the star rating that politicians may attach to the status of democracy that exists within and outside their political parties anarchism is gaining ground day by day. Protests which normally emerge on legitimate grounds have proliferated to such an extent that entirely harmful demands such as the removal of safe traffic regulations and implementation of vital administrative regulations have also cropped up recently.
Further, both the Government and the Opposition seem to be unaware of the gravity of the economic crisis as seen from the waste and ostentation that is still rampant. Fighting corruption and fraud seems to be replaced by shielding wrong-doers, discouraging whistle blowers and obstructing investigations.
Finally, it must be said that the blame for dragging the country to the edge of a precipice cannot be placed on the present Government. However, it is responsible for not managing the situation as warranted by the circumstances and its failure to take the people into confidence in meeting the challenge.

Federal Reserve upbeat on US economy as it holds rates
The US central bank remained positive on the economy, as it kept interest rates on hold in its first meeting since President Donald Trump took office.
The Federal Reserve ruled unanimously to keep its benchmark interest rate in a range of 0.5% to 0.75%.
The jobs market and economic activity had continued to strengthen, it said.
"Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late," the central bank also said in a statement.
The Fed had raised its benchmark interest rate by 0.25% in December, only the second increase in a decade.
President Trump has promised to boost growth through tax cuts, spending and deregulation, raising the prospect of higher inflation. Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen warned last month that, with the economy near full employment, the central bank risked a "nasty surprise" on inflation if it was too slow with rate hikes. On Wednesday, the Fed said inflation "will rise to 2% over the medium term", but did not comment on the effect of the Trump administration's plans.
Despite being upbeat, the central bank also signalled the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC), the body which sets rates, would still only make "gradual increases".
It did not give any update on when the body might next raise rates. Investors were hoping for guidance on when the next rise would be and how many were planned for this year.
"This is only the first FOMC meeting of eight in 2017 so there are still plenty of opportunities for the Fed to raise interest rates throughout the year and it is likely that we will see a rate rise in March or June," said Kully Samra, UK managing director of wealth management firm Charles Schwab. "In our view, two rate hikes this year would be sufficient to stave off inflation concerns and would not negatively impact economic growth."
Dennis de Jong, managing director at UFX.com, said that uncertainty about Trump's economic policies could further delay the next rate rise.
"With Trump still light on any concrete plans or time lines, [chairwoman Janet] Yellen may be forced to wait even longer before pulling the trigger," he said.
Official figures last week indicated the US economy grew at an annual pace of 1.9% in the fourth quarter of last year, a slowdown from growth in the previous quarter of 3.5%.
However, the central bank's outlook suggested "the economy continues to chug along and sentiment has improved", said Brian Jacobson, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo.
The dollar and US stock markets were little changed on the Fed's announcement, as investors had widely expected rates to be left untouched.
The Dow Jones index rose 0.1% at 19,891 points. The S&P 500 index moved less than 1 point to 2,279 and the Nasdaq edged up 0.5% at 5,643.

Minister of Foreign Affairs Mangala Samaraweera called on Ethiopian President Mulatu Teshome, at the Presidential Palace in Addis Ababa.
Sri Lanka is working on new policy of restoring friendship with traditional friends and allies, and building stronger relations with the African region.
The decision to set up a Sri Lankan consulate in Ethiopian was made with Ethiopia emerging as the diplomatic and political capital of Africa, with the African Union also being headquartered in Addis Ababa.
During his meeting with the Ethiopian President, Minister Samaraweera explained how the national unity government had taken the country forward during the past two years, based on the three pillars of democratization, reconciliation and development.
He further stated that Sri Lanka is in the process of finalizing a new Constitution that will celebrates the diversity of Sri Lanka, and said that the Ethiopian Constitution would be an inspiration for Sri Lanka, which is also multi-ethnic, a multi-religious and multi-lingual.
President Mulatu Teshome highlighted the importance of peace, stability and democracy for the progress in any developing country and stated that Sri Lanka and Ethiopia could do much more for each other, considering the similarities of the two countries.
President Teshome also said that Ethiopia could seek Sri Lankan expertise with regard to the apparel sector, as the island nation has proved that textiles and garment exports plays a key role in advancing the country's economy.
President Mulatu Teshom also accepted Foreign Minister Samaraweeras invitation to visit Sri Lanka.

Former England Chelsea star Lampard retires
LONDON, Thursday: Former England and Chelsea midfield star Frank Lampard retired on Thursday aged 38, calling time on a playing career that will be remembered as one of the Premier League's finest.
Lampard did not reveal what he plans to do next, but said he was grateful to the Football Association for the opportunity to do his coaching badges, suggesting he may go into management.
Chelsea's record goalscorer said he had turned down "a number of exciting offers" to carry on playing in Britain and abroad.
"After 21 incredible years I have decided that now is the right time to finish my career as a professional footballer," Lampard wrote on Facebook.
"I'm immensely proud of the trophies I've won, of representing my country over 100 times and of scoring more than 300 career goals."

FR against Hambantota framework agreement fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara seeking an order to quash the Framework Agreement entered into by the Government of Sri Lanka with two Chinese companies was fixed for support on February 13 by Supreme Court.
When the petition was taken up before Chief Justice K. Sripavan and Justice Anil Goonaratne, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the Sri Lanka Port Authority informed Court that the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) pertaining to the Hambantota harbour had been signed in 2012.
The original MOU was signed in 2012. This is a continuous and uninterrupted process from 2012. The petitioner has concealed this fact through his petition and he was a member of Cabinet at the time the Cabinet paper was presented, Rajaratnam added.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court directed the Secretary to the Ministry of Ports and Shipping to have a copy of the MOU signed in 2012 submitted in Court on the next support date.
The petitioner cited members of the Cabinet of Ministers, members of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (referred to as the CANC and also sometimes referred to as the Committee of Secretaries), the Director General of the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of National Polices and Economic Affairs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company as respondents.
The Petitioner states that this petition relates inter alia to the infringement and imminent infringement and continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the Peoples Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors and lease and convey and enter into an agreement or in any other manner dispose approximately 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 Square Kilometers.
The petitioner further sought a Declaration that the Framework Agreement dated 08.12.2016 as null and void, and declare that the said agreement has no force of law until the same is approved by Parliament, as required by Article 157 of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva with Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared for the petitioner.

GMOA strike today
The GMOA yesterday announced that they will resort to an all island trade union action from 8 a.m. to 12 noon today in protest against the attack on medical students who engaged in a street protest in Colombo.
The GMOA was vocal about granting provisional registration to SAITM graduates to practise as medical practitioners.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, he said that the GMOA plans to inform the President and the relevant authorities that all possible measures be taken to protect patients rights. The GMOA will pressurize them to do so.
According to Dr.Zoysa, the GMOA will commence legal measures after an indepth study of the legal background of the issue. The GMOA will also educate all parties including the public on the existing situation and the threat posed to the safety of the lives of the patients.
At present, a panel of expert lawyers of the GMOA are studying the 42 page judgement given by the Court of Appeal in connection with the SAITM issue. The GMOA will not let Sri Lanka become the first country in the world where doctors without Medical Council registration start practicing, he added.
Speaking further he said Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne should take actions in relation to the technical report produced by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to him five months ago.
Answering a journalist, Dr.De Soysa said, SLMC examined the Medical Faculty of Kothalawala Defence University (KDU) and presented recommendations regarding the standards of the operations when it was established.
We are not only specifically against the registration of the medical graduates of SAITM. Therefore, even now the SLMC can inspect whether the required standards are maintained at the KDU Medical Faculty and we are not in opposition to it,Dr.De Soysa said.
Our only ultimate aim is to refrain from Sri Lanka becoming the only country to produce doctors without the permission from the medical council of the respective country.
He also said that a discussion had taken place between the SLMC and the GMOA yesterday.
Provisions related to safeguarding the standards of medical education and the rights of patients were discussed at the meeting, he added. Referring to the protest campaigns scheduled to be held Dr. De Soysa said they would minimise the negative impacts caused to the patients due to the protest campaigns.

The tender has been cancelled until all investigations are complete.
Minister Dr. Senaratne had pointed out that the complaints were in connection with changing the name of the company and re-registering as a new company under a new address, after various misconducts in the past under a different name.
The company was about to import 600 vials of the cancer drug from India.

Hybrid croissant
We need to dissect this hybrid croissant. Slice into it. Understand how and why it was created.
Before we do, lets together pay quick homage to the traditional French pastry: a work of breakfast genius. Theyre soft in the middle, crispy on the outside. So pure and brilliant.
Now thats out the way, its time to come to terms with the fact that a bakery has decided to put sushi inside its croissants. The creation is called the Cali Croissant, a fusion food combining a French classic with a Japanese delicacy.
Naturally, it was created in Los Angeles  by the Mr. Holmes Bake House, as LA Mag discovered. Its the place that invented the cruffin (croissant/muffin partnership, which is altogether more workable).
For the fish croissant, the bakery put a popular sushi roll, of salmon, nori (seaweed), ginger, and wasabi inside a standard croissant. For pastry purists and sushi aficionados, its comparable to an indictable criminal offence. Weve no idea why the salmon is smoked.
Its worth noting that the Mr. Holmes Bake House has included with its dish a sachet of soy sauce  for dipping. I suppose that underpins its vague, irresponsible way it goes about cooking, given that sushi should never, ever, be dipped in soy sauce. Or so the Japanese say (not that theyd know).
The creation is probably just a stunt, something for people to talk about. It also follows the famous cronut (though thats from a different bakery), and a host of other strange inventions. You have to admire the imagination and bravery.

ICC Champions Trophy 2017: 5 things to look forward to
Starting June 1, 2017, the top eight One-Day International sides in the world will get together for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England and Wales. The opening match will pit England, the host, against Bangladesh at The Oval in London, which is one of three venues that will be used for the tournament.
The ICC Champions Trophy 2017 is scheduled to end on June 18 (with a reserve day in place), when the finalists face off at The Oval. Edgbaston and Cardiff will be the other two venues to share the responsibility of staging the 15-match tournament.
So to mark the occasion of exactly five months to go to the first match of #CT17, lets take a look at five things to whet the appetite ahead of the 18 day bonanza of ODI cricket.
1- Every Match Counts: The eight teams will be divided into two groups of four; each will play the three other sides in their respective group once in a bid to make it to the semi-finals. The short and intense nature of the tournament makes it such that there will be high stakes on the outcome of every match with every match absolutely crucial.
2 - Lots of runs: Going by the trend in the recent bilateral series between India and England, the modern ODI game continues to be conducive to heavy run-scoring and fans can expect much of the same at the ICC Champions Trophy 2017. In the most recent ODI series in England, against Pakistan, the host posted 444 in the third ODI. In the fifth game, Pakistan successfully responded to England's 302 for 9 by scoring 304 for 6 in 48.2 overs in Cardiff, one of the venues of the tournament. Its likely there will be runs aplenty.
3 - The Next Generation: Several exciting young players can be expected to make their global 50-over tournament debuts. In the bowling department, Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman, South Africa's Kagiso Rabada, India's Jasprit Bumrah and Australia's Adam Zampa are some of the names to keep an eye out for. Among batsmen, India's Kedar Jadhav, Pakistan's Babar Azam, England's Sam Billings and Jason Roy fit the bill, while Mitchell Santner from New Zealand and Marcus Stoinis from Australia are among the more promising all-rounders yet to feature in a marquee 50-over tournament.
4 - Open nature of tournament: This looks like it could be the most competitive ICC Champions Trophy of all time with little to choose between all eight sides. Pakistan  ranked No. 8  recently won an ODI against No. 1 ranked Australia on their home-soil in a further indication that no game can be taken for granted. Across the board, teams have adopted a more aggressive, fearless approach towards the 50-over game, which has helped bring down the chasm between the teams. On account of the sharp and uncompromising format of the tournament coupled with the qualitative similarity of teams, the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 can be expected to deliver intense competition.
5 - Bangladesh's return to Champions Trophy: The Bangladesh Tigers havent qualified for the ICC Champions Trophy since the 2006 edition. Much has changed for the team in the last two years. Its defeat of England to make it to the knockouts of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 deserves special mention. It then went on a winning spree in the format defeating Pakistan, India and South Africa in successive ODI series at home. It is ranked No. 7  one above Pakistan  and kept West Indies out of the competition. It is yet to prove its credentials overseas, and this tournament presents it with the ideal opportunity. Whatever happens, its going to be a memorable tournament, roll on June 1, 2017.

Impartiality assured in Treasury Bond investigation
The government would take action to recover the damage caused by the treasury bond issue if the allegation is proved, said Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
He added that President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe the controversial Treasury Bond Issue as it is required to investigate the alleged fraud of this government in the same manner that it investigates alleged frauds of the previous government under Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Minister Jayasekara said that the Commission was given three months to submit the report with its decision on whether there had been any irregularity or corrupt practice in the transaction and who was responsible and the recommendations.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) head office.
He said although some question why the President did not appoint a special Presidential Commission to look into the treasury bond issue, they lack legal knowledge. He added that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry has powers to inquire in detail into the matter whereas the Special Commission is appointed to deprive one's civil rights.
"Although some question the President's delay in taking action, he had to wait for the response in Parliament and the Courts."
Jayasekara said the members of the Commission are Supreme Court Justices K.T. Chitrasiri, Prasanna Sujeewa Jayawardana and retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Veluppillai.
He said the President had assigned the Commission to examine the management, administration and conduct of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) in respect to the Bond issuance of the controversial Treasury Bond issue and if there had been any malpractices, irregularity or non-compliance with or disregard for the proper procedures applicable.
The commission was assigned to query if there had been negligence or irresponsibility that resulted in damage to the Government or any statutory body including the Central Bank. He added that they will inquire if there had been any misuse of power too.
He added that after three months further action would be taken based on the outcome of the investigation. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had also submitted a report of the debate to the Attorney General and he is expected to take action.

Indian economy not in good shape: Manmohan Singh
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday painted a bleak picture of the Indian economy insisting it is not in good shape.
Former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said the government is hiding behind GDP numbers that are being challenged. Releasing the Real State of Economy 2017, a document prepared by the Congress research cell at the party headquarters here, Singh said it speaks about the state of Indias economy, its many issues and where it is heading.
That the Indian economy is not in a good state is obvious. Even IMF has downgraded our GDP growth and it will not be 7.6 per cent but less than 6.6 per cent, he said. Chidambaram said the state of the economy is not something that we can be happy about and expressed concern over the low credit growth which he claimed is at 5 per cent, the lowest in several decades.
BJP is hiding behind a GDP number which is being challenged. People are not dazzled by it, but are asking where the jobs are NDA government tends to believe exaggerated version of economy, this research document is closer to truth than what government will say tomorrow, he said.
Chidambaram said every government must be optimistic, but optimism must stem from a realistic assessment of situation. Yet, if government presents tomorrow a rosy picture of the economy, people of India are entitled to question that. There are no jobs, capital formation is declining, credit growth is the lowest in several decades, he said.
Chidambaram wanted government to focus on fiscal consolidation and said, there are serious question marks on this governments ability to follow fiscal prudence.
He dismissed suggestions that the 2008 farm loan waiver was a populist measure, saying, It was based on the response to a demand from the farming community and was a very wise decision.

JK Rowling hits back over threats to burn Harry Potter books

Harry Potter author JK Rowling has hit back at Twitter users who threatened to burn her books following her criticism of President Trump.
Rowling's recent Twitter feed has been filled with her retweets criticising the president's recent travel ban.
Some followers have taken umbrage with her stance, with several saying they have burned her books or plan to do so, and one suggesting she "should stay out of politics".
But the novelist has proved a match for her critics with her mocking responses.
One Twitter user said they would now "burn your books and movies, too".
Rowling hit back: "Well, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter."
Another said she had "just burned all their Harry Potter books after being a fan for 17 years".
Rowling's reposte "Guess it's true what they say: you can lead a girl to books about the rise and fall of an autocrat, but you still can't make her think."
Another Twitter user posted: "You're a grown ass woman whose entire career is based on stories about a nerd who turns people into frogs. Stay out of politics."
Rowling responded: "In - Free - Countries - Anyone - Can - Talk - About - Politics.
"Try sounding out the syllables aloud, or ask a fluent reader to help."
It isn't the first time people have burnt or threatened to burn JK Rowling's books.
In the late 1990s, not long after the first couple of Harry Potter books were published, some had concerns about the magic and supernatural references, which they believed went against Bible teachings.
A pile of Potter books was set alight in New Mexico in December 2001 by a religious group who claimed Harry was "the devil".
And a preacher in Maine in the US marked The Chamber of Secrets' release by holding a party in which he shredded copies of Potter books.

JVP vows to fight against SAITM legitimisation
The JVP said it will continue to struggle against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) being recognised as a legitimate private medical school.
We will discuss this matter with university lecturers, doctors and other academics and would not allow this corrupt organisation to be legalised, he said.
The Court of Appeals ruling to grant provisional registration to SAITM Medical graduates from the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) will affect the Sri Lankan education standard, he said.
Most political parties too are opposing this decision despite their differences, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake told a media briefing yesterday.
He said the JVP strongly opposes the legalisation of SAITM which is a known hive of corruption. Arrangements will be made to stage protests countrywide, he warned.
"Despite the court order, there is no provision for SAITM to be registered with the SLMC. The reason is that they have to wait for the verdict once the appeal is filed in the Supreme Court," said Ratnayake adding that the SLMC has said it will file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
"There is no need for a lawsuit, because Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and the student who filed the case have recognised SAITM in principal. This is unfair as medical bodies or
medical practitioners were not allowed to give evidences in this case and it is wrong," he said.
"A five-member committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena when he was the Health Minister during the former regime had ruled that SAITM was illegal. Hence it is not clear as to how the current Health Minister can defend SAITM," he pointed out.
"Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had admitted that it was wrong to allow SAITM. Therefore, President Maithripala Sirisena's failure to correct this mistake will certainly boomerang on him at the next election," Ratnayake warned.

It is being worked out, he said and added, Gunaratnam has expressed his keenness to enter politics in the country. He is our most talented and experienced political activist.
Asked if there was any chance as a leftist political party that they might stand side by side with the Janatha Vimukthi Permuna (JVP), Jagoda said they stand with the JVP on the issue of SAITM. Other than that, we have our principles to go about in the context of our political agendum, he said.
Gunaratnam was arrested on November 4, 2015, on charges that he had violating visa regulations after arriving in the country on a tourist visa.

A letter to  My brother, whom I bullied when we were young:The letter you always wanted to write
I was five when you were born. Looking at pictures from that time, I look so happy with you. I am holding you, bathing you, I am smiling, I look smitten. But I do not remember that feeling, as if the person in the pictures were somebody else.
I was a daddys girl, but I was also the one to break in our parents. I used to call myself the familys guinea pig, and you were the happy one, the joker, the one who reaped the rewards of all my battles won or lost. At that point, I must have decided that we were enemies, competitors for the love and attention of our parents, and this feeling is at the core of all my early memories. All I remember is resenting you.
So, for as long as I could, I made your life a misery. I taunted you, teased you, tricked you, humiliated you, manhandled you. You tell me its not as bad as I remember, but I recall a couple of times when you were left in tears. Our little sister was born when I was 11, and very soon you two bonded strongly and pushed me aside. Did you bond with her because I was becoming a monster, or did I become a monster because of your bond
Thankfully, you quickly grew tall and strong, and soon you were able to overcome me physically. From then on it was down to verbal abuse and psychological warfare. By the time I was at university, you were a teenager and we competed for higher resources: money, the family car, clothes, parental pride.
It all came to a forced stop when I moved abroad as an exchange student. Almost 20 years have passed, and I only see you when Im visiting the family. The hate left me some long time ago, while I wasnt watching. And at the same time, love must have crept in, sneaking somewhere through the back of my mind.
Despite all the abuse during those years, you have turned into a happy, friendly, passionate, generous human being. You are the clown and joker of the family; the defender of your friends. You are the most beautiful and charismatic person that I know. And, with your wife and best friend, you have just had your first child. Nobody deserves this happiness more; you have worked so hard to become who you are.
You have implied that youve forgiven me, or even that there is nothing to forgive, and I have never brought up the subject properly and clearly. I would like to, but it would only serve my need for confession, and most likely further assurances of your forgiveness. But I prefer to remember the hurt  I will always hurt in shame when I look back. All those missed, wasted years in which I should have been your loving sister, standing by your side, defending instead of attacking you in your own home. I aim to be now what I always should have been.
I am so proud of you, my heart wells up with love for you and your sister. I will be forever glad that I have the chance to love you both.

LSSP to hold day of protest to urge govt. to resign
The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) has proposed to hold a day of national protest against the government in order to rally all anti-government forces to urge it to resign, General Secretary Prof. Tissa Vitharana said yesterday. The LSSP will forward this proposal to the Joint Opposition today, he said.
He said the large crowd at the Nugegoda rally proves the unpopularity of this government. We will continue this struggle until the government resigns.
The government has begun a dictatorial journey now. It is crushing trade unions actions and students struggles continuously, he said.
All Ceylon Telecommunication Employees Union Vice President M. S. Mangala was abducted and later freed. But, we demand a full investigation from the government in this regard he said. We also urge the people of this country to boycott the Independence Day because this government has robbed the people of their independence. We received true independence only in 1972 when Sri Lanka became a Republic.Therefore, while most countries commemorate the day they became a republic, we have neglected it, Prof. Vitharana said.
The government is trying to spend US$ 400 million to purchase aircraft even when there is no war. The government has also allowed the United States to establish a base in Trincomalee to keep their war ships. The US wants to prevent China from becoming the most powerful nation in the world within the next 10 to 20 years. Therefore,the US is using Sri Lanka to achieve its aim, Prof. Vitharana said.
Southern Provincial Councillor and Lanka Sama Samaja Party Media Secretary Ven. Baddegama Samitha Thera said one of the Deputy Ministers of the Yahapalana government is openly criticizing and attacking government servants. Government servants are bound by various circulars and codes . We therefore condemn the attacks by politicians on public servants, Ven.Samitha Thera said.
President Maithripala Sirisena has promised to abolish the Executive Presidency and not to contest the Presidency again. However, his followers say he will be the next President of Sri Lanka. But,the UNPers have said that they have not reached such a decision. This shows the differences in the unity government, the Thera added.

Mattis warns North Korea of 'overwhelming' response to nuclear use

The US defence secretary James Mattis has said any use of nuclear weapons by North Korea would be met with an "effective and overwhelming" response.
Mattis is in South Korea, where he hasbeen assuring Seoulit has America's continuing support.
He also reconfirmed plans to deploy a US missile defence system in South Korea later this year.
North Korea's repeated missile and nuclear tests and aggressive statements continue to alarm and anger the region.
The US has a considerable military presence in South Korea and Japan, as part of a post-war defence deal. There are just under 28,500 US troops in the country, for which Seoul pays about $900m (710m) annually.
President Donald Trump has previously said he wants both South Korea and Japan to pay more towards maintaining that presence.
Mattis has been using his visit to reassure South Korea that the Trump administration "remains steadfast" in its "iron-clad" defence commitments to the region, said the Pentagon.
Speaking after talks at the defence ministry with his South Korean counterpart Han Min-koo, Mattis told reporters that "any attack on the United States, or our allies, will be defeated, and any use of nuclear weapons would be met with a response that would be effective and overwhelming".
North Korea conducted its fifth test of a nuclear device last year, and claims it is capable of carrying out a nuclear attack on the US, though experts are still unconvinced its technology has progressed that far.
It has also said in recent weeks that it has a new intercontinental ballistic missile, capable of reaching the US mainland, which it is prepared to test launch at any time.
Under the Obama administration, the US and South Korea agreed to deploy a US-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defence system in South Korea.
Its supporters say it is aimed solely at defending from North Korean threats. But China and Russia have complained it is unnecessary and provocative.
Beijing says it goes "far beyond the defence needs of the Korean peninsula".
It is also unpopular with some South Koreans, who fear missile bases could become targets and endanger people who live nearby.
Speaking on Thursday, Mattis sought to reassure China, saying there is "no other nation that needs to be concerned about THAAD other than North Korea".
Han said Mattis's visit "communicates the strongest warning to North Korea".
Mattis will travel to Japan later on Friday, where there are a further 50,000 soldiers plus their dependents and support staff in Japan. The US pays about $5.5bn for its Japanese bases in 2016, with Japan paying a further $4bn.

Minister Dr. Senaratne instructed Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama to amend the existing transfer system. He instructed to abolish all existing 'acting positions and provide opportunity for the doctors to get themselves appointed to high positions, he said.
The minister stated the transfer system existed in the past, allowing some persons to interfere in transfers of doctors, should be stopped, the media coordinator said.

Mel Gunasekera: Exceptional journalist
Mel Gunasekera was a hard-nosed journalist, but many of her colleagues and friends remember her most for having a warm personality and being a good friend.
Some of their fondest memories of Mel Gunasekera is of her infectious smile.
"She used to be always smiling," says Shafraz Farook, a colleague who used to work with her at The Sunday Times and later at Lanka Business Online of which she was the founding editor.
"It is the first thing that comes to my mind. She had a smile for everyone. She also had a way of putting people at ease and get them talking as if they had been old friends."
Ruvini Jayasinghe, then Business Editor at the Sunday Times, hired her as a trainee journalist soon after Mel returned from the UK, armed with a business degree.
The two became good friends in addition to being colleagues.
"She would go out of her way to help her friends, almost without their knowing about it," she recalls. "It would be through other people that we get to know that she had done it."
Mel was one of the most promising young persons she had helped bring into the profession. "She was very willing and keen to take up challenges, Jayasinghe said.
"She had the amazing knack of networking and keeping in touch with people."
Mel's warm personality instantly drew people to her. Many of her professional contacts also became life-long friends.
She could keep a telephone conversation going on for long periods effortlessly, drawing out people and sharing a bit of herself in the process. She kept track of birthdays of colleagues and arranged cakes and wishes.
"Her loyalty and unwavering commitment to family and friends, sense of responsibility, fearlessness, integrity and compassion for even animals made a rare human being in our age," says Lakshaman Bandaranaike, publisher of Lanka Business Online. "She was ever willing to help people who sought her advice."
Zainab Ibrahim, was just out of school and waiting to enter university, when Mel hired and brought her into the profession.
"I remember how much of a teacher Mel was, how she took me under her wing and how much time she spent teaching me," she says. "I value a lot of things she taught. Even though I changed careers, I still use them. I remember laughing with her about funny things. A lot of those memories I hold close."
It was a great shock to family and friends, when Mel was wrenched away from them on a February morning three years ago. Amal Jayasinghe, Colombo Bureau Chief of French news agency AFP, where Mel was the first woman reporter, could hardly believe she was no more.
"Mel had a zest for life," says Amal Jayasinghe. "Bursting with energy, even while juggling her journalistic work, she sang for Contempo, a choir of her alma mater St. Bridgets Convent in Colombo, and was a concert violinist."
Sri Lanka's 30-year war, in which many journalists had died, was now over. His first reaction was that the report of Mels death was not true. But tragically, it was.
"Mel had a special knack for unobtrusively getting a story from victims of Sri Lankas drawn-out war," he said. "She reported heart-wrenching stories of mothers desperately looking for their missing children."
At the AFP Colombo office, a framed photo of Mel is now on the wall, and is one of the first things that visitors see when they enter. After leaving journalism Mel joined the financial sector and went to work for Fitch Ratings.
"I knew her basically as a friend," says Maninda Wickramasinghe, head of Fitch Ratings in Colombo.
"It just happened that she wanted to move on and sent me her CV to forward it to someone else. I went through her CV and realised that she fit the bill perfectly for a position that had just come up. She was surprised and very happy to join us."
"She was very persevering and very conscientious. It was very easy to delegate work and it would be done. She was multi-talented and it is only later that I learnt she was an accomplished singer."
"The world would certainly have been a better place if we had few more people like Mel," adds Lakshaman Bandaranaike. "The love and affection she left in our hearts and will always linger."

Mouthwatering moments
The ceremonial inauguration of Black Pepper was done in spectacular style last week with mouthwatering innovative dishes beings served to the guests who attended. The ambience was just right making it a memorable evening. Black Pepper is surely going to be a popular destination located in the Dutch Hospital, which will grow in popularity over the coming months, with more and more visitors falling in love with it.
Daily News spoke to Earls Court Group, Group Director Emal Gunasekara about the Restaurant.
The crab is the King of Sea Food. We export crab to Singapore and they make Black Pepper Crab and provide it to their customers. So we thought, why dont we go ahead and why dont we initiate it and why dont we cook it ourselves and produce something better We can do it because we have a skilled staff. Hence the creation of Black Pepper King of Spices, said Gunasekara.
He said that there was a trial period with experimentations, which culminated in a grand opening.
Earls Court Group is mainly into the hospitality industry such as hotels  accommodation and food. So as a restaurant we are not moving forward. So this is our new venture by me because my father asked me to come up with something and go ahead. So I thought that Dutch Hospital is a very good market in the heart of Colombo which people know. It is a very happening area. So we thought about this concept with providing good food, pointed out Gunasekara.
Under Earls Court Group there are many hotels such as Earls Regency, their first hotel which came up in 2000. Then moving on Earls Regent in Kandy came up and Earls Reef Beruwala came up very recently along with Kandy City Hotel.
This is our first restaurant and in this restaurant there are around 20 to 30 staff. After the success of this business we want to move with the franchise. So we thought of going out of this area and into developing areas and going out of Colombo, such as Kandy and down South. We are thinking about spreading our chain. This is my father, Earl Gunasekaras concept, explained Gunasekara. Under Earls Group there are financial services, hospitality industry, Black Pepper restaurant and transport services.

The Royal families of the middle east are famous for having pets like fully-grown Cheetahs, Bengal tigers, lions and even the extremely dangerous jaguars!
Another popular pet that is synonymous with the Saudi Royalty is the falcon. These falcons are trained like professionals and treated like kings.
They are given the best food, best places to stay and even fly first class.
Yes, you read that right. The pet falcons of royal families do not travel in the cargo section with the rest of the peasant pets.
They actually sit with the royal family in the first class seats where normal people sit. And if you thought that this is strange, you will be astonished to know that the UAE government has issued more than 28,000 falcon passports between 2002 and 2013. And no, the falcons are perfectly fine with it because they are quite used to flying, you see. Mid Day

Police trapped Veerappan using his businessman contact

Sources part of the operation told TOI that the businessman in question was a well-respected citizen. An STF informer, who had managed to gain access to Veerappan and acted as a messenger for the gang, stunned the cops by dropping the "bombshell" of the businessman's name.
The 52-year-old bandit, whose eyesight was failing, had wanted the businessman to procure some guns and arrange for a cataract surgery.
 When the informer called the businessman and gave the password Veerappan had given, the businessman asked him to come to a guest house in another town. The STF wired up the informer for the meeting and listened in to the conversation. Referring to Veerappan as Anna (elder brother), the businessman inquired about his health.
When the informer told him that the bandit needed a cataract surgery and some weapons, the businessman agreed to send word through his man.
The moment the informer left the guest house, an STF team in plainclothes stormed in and threatened the businessman that his links with Lankan extremists would be out. When the STF men offered him an amnesty scheme if he helped them nab Veerappan, the businessman readily agreed.
The team tutored the businessman: He would send a messenger to Veerappan saying the guns would be arranged through friends in Lanka and a man would escort Veerappan to a hospital in Trichy or Madurai to get his eye operated, after which he would be taken to Lanka.
After the arms deal, he would be brought back to India. The businessman wanted to know who would be the escort. He was told not to worry about that.
For this job, K Vijay Kumar, the then head of the STF, brought in sub-inspector Vellaidurai. STF got the businessman to meet a Veerappan aide at a tea shop in Dharmapuri. The aide dramatically tore a lottery ticket into two and gave one bit to the businessman, saying it was "Anna's travel ticket".
This bit was to be carried by the man who would escort Veerappan to the hospital for the eye surgery after matching the other part of the ticket, which a Veerappan gang member would be carrying.
This turned out to be Veerappan's one-way ticket to hell.

Public policing of government
The long awaited Right to Information Act will come into operation from today, opening the doors to the public to have their finger on the pulse of the government, so to speak. The public will now be able to demand for information from any Public Authority designated by the RTI Commission such as a Ministry, Department, Public Corporation, Local and Political Authorities as well as Companies, NGOs, Educational Institutions to the extent defined in the Act, and all Courts and Tribunals.
Sri Lanka has now joined the advanced countries such as India and the USA which has long established such a mechanism to ensure transparency and accountability in governance. The recent US Presidential election campaign showed to what extent the American public was making use of the RTI to expose the doings of their politicians and public officials. It is hoped that the Sri Lankan public too would be as enthusiastic in seizing this opportunity to ensure probity and transparency in the conduct of politicians and public officials.
True, parliamentary watchdog COPE could demand for documents and question public officials. But this process is flawed to the extent that there is always the possibility of concealment. Besides one recalls not long ago Sri Lankan airlines refusing to cooperate with COPE under some pretext with the watchdog remaining helpless. But under RTI, all officials in the designated bodies are compelled to provide all information asked for, with an Appeal process too included in the event of non compliance. No longer can an official now get away with the usual comment apita ea visthara denna behe (We are not permitted to provide such information). Bringing the NGOs too into the orbit is a good move considering how these bodies are usually viewed with a jaundiced eye by the enlightened public.
With the operation of the RTI Sri Lanka will be very much an open society where nothing could be swept under the carpet any longer by scheming politicians and bureaucrats. The designated state bodies would now be obliged to provide all information demanded by the public that hitherto were a no go zone to them, barring sensitive info that may impinge on national security or that of a highly personal nature. Other than that, nothing could be held back upon demand for information on a particular tender or income details of a bureaucrat, official or any government panjandrum. In short the state service will now be open house that will come under close scrutiny of the general public.
There will be no need for demonstrations now by trade unions with accusations that this official or that Ministry Secretary had resorted to bribery, cut shady deals or squandered public funds. All they have to do is demand for the records from the relevant state body and then go public. Particularly, all school admissions will come under close scrutiny, with interested parties now able to obtain all the relevant details from the CEB, Water Board etc. to unravel the bogus addresses furnished by parents to admit their children to popular schools. This would also now make the Principals and school authorities take extra care in school admissions lest they too be exposed.
The Yahapalanaya Government, particularly Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, should be commended for their efforts to see through the RTI. One recalls Jayasuriya when he a minister in the Rajapaksa government making a great effort to introduce the Act but to no avail. This is understandable considering the extent of the shady deals that enriched the VVIPs, their relatives and henchmen that are now being unraveled, with all its sordid details. The National Carrier would certainly not have suffered the financial ruin it is in today had such a mechanism as the RTI been in existence at the time. That is, if there was anyone bold enough to ask for information even if such a mechanism did exist.
It is hoped that professional bodies and civil society organisations such as the Friday Forum would now set the ball rolling and demand information that is no longer classified, to expose the doings in the Banks and other financial institutions. No doubt, such organisations are going to be a thorn in the flesh of those prone to corruption. It is such groups that possess intellectual know how and the necessary wherewithal to deal with such complicated issues that are out of the ken of the ordinary public.
The RTI would also have come like manna from heaven to those anti-corruption crusaders such as JVPs Wasantha Samarasinghe who no doubt are is going to keep the rogue elements on their toes. The RTI has also succeeded in taking the bottom out the Joint Opposition's much touted anti-corruption campaign where they have named a so called Top Ten corrupt government politicians. Instead of summoning media conferences and playing to the gallery, all that the likes of Mahindananda Aluthgamage now have to do is go before the RTI Commission with their cases. Their corruption accusations will no longer be valid when they have been given the opportunity to back up their allegations with facts.

Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa is the only minister who does not draw a state salary or use a state vehicle today. He has a character that of his father the late President, Ranasinghe Premadasa, Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Atukorale said.
She was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stones for a reawakened village scheme of 33 houses in Balangoda. Atukorale said people in this country who were fed up with the previous regime helped install a good governance government by electing President Maithripala Sirisena to power at the January 8 presidential election. Today, people have regained their lost freedom and the police was empowered to maintain law and order. Interference in police functions and duties was totally eliminated now, she said.

SL Tourism yet to respond  to Interbrand proposal
Interbrand, the world's largest and most influential brand consultancy plans a mega expansion into the Sri Lankan market.
The global giant first entered the country in 2016 with the rebranding of Hatton National Bank together with Sri Lankan partner Michel Nugawela Designs (MND).
Brands promotion is the best way to move a board upwards, said Ashish Mishra, Managing Director interbred India. He said that with better branding most of Sri Lankan companies that are only selling their products locally could go globe.
He also said that it was the private sector that drove India globally known in the 1990's via the IT industry. But today this story is old and KPO and BPO terms are not only confined to India. This may be because India is overpriced. Sri Lanka can compete in this sector as the island nation cost are cheaper.
He also said that they have also made proposals for new branding to both the Tea Board and Sri Lanka Tourism a year ago. Both were very enthusiastic. But they are yet to come back.
MND, has branded and repositioned many of Sri Lanka's most renowned and respected brands, including Aitken Spence PLC, Elephant House, Goodhope PLC, Lion Lager and Ceylinco Life.
The brand consultancy brings over two decades of experience in brand strategy and positioning, brand architecture, brand identity development, packaging design, and engagement strategies that involve employees as brand assets, resulting in new mindsets and behaviours by individuals and teams.
Established in 1974 and an opinion leader in the field of value-based brand management, Interbrand was the first brand consultancy to recognize the significance of a brand as a business asset and introduce the brand valuation concept. With a network of over 33 offices in 27 countries, Interbrand's combination of rigorous strategy, analytics, and world-class design enables it to assist clients in creating and managing brand value effectively, across all touch points, in all market dynamics.

SLFP and govt. would protect Auditor General: Dayasiri
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party and the Government would protect the Auditor General as he is an impartial government officer, Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday said.
The Auditor General has rendered a commendable service so far, but if he commits any mistake we would criticize him the Minister added.
He cannot investigate into treasury bond issuance numbering 2300 occasions at once. It had taken him three months to prepare the report on the inquiry into the questioned Treasury Bond issue. So how could he give a report on 2300 issuances at once
He made these observations in response to queries made by a media personnel at the Press Conference held at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) head office in Colombo.
Minister Jayasekara said that the Auditor General is answerable only to Parliament and not anybody else. The Finance Minister has no right to ask for documents from him, Minister Jayasekara said.
The Auditor General gives those documents as and when he is asked. As he has nothing to hide, he uploads them. The other matter is the Right to Information Bill has been passed in Parliament. What is the use of it, if information is concealed
He also told the Joint Opposition that they need not to worry about the security of the Auditor General as they would protect him. Gampaha District Parliamentarian Sudarshani Fernandopulle also participated.

Soothing rhythms from India
The evening was a beautiful and pleasant one. The effort put into the dances was certainly commendable and well appreciated. The boys had great vigor and passion. They were quite dazzling. It was obvious that they had trained well and that they put in 100 percent.
The Daily News witnessed Taal Taranga, an Odissi dance recital presented by the Rudrakshya Foundation, performed last week at Bishops Auditorium. The dance by the boys was followed by some remarkable dance acts. The young ladies who were elegant and graceful in their fluid movements. All performers showed an energy and maturity that was obvious. Their commitment certainly was laudable. Dressed in bright colors they guaranteed that there was not a boring moment in the evening.
They were trained by Guru Bichitrananda Swain, a legend in India. He has carved a niche for himself as one of todays leading Odissi choreographers and has earned wide critical acclaim for his work in Odissi.
Rudrakshya has performed in many countries such as South Africa, the Ivory Coast, Nigeria, the United Kingdom, Canada and the US.
On the occasion of the 68th Republic Day of India, the Indian Cultural Centre held the Odissi Dance Recital - Taal Taranga. The event was graced by the Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu and Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Mano Ganesan. The event was organized by the Indian High Commission in Colombo.
It gives me immense pleasure to welcome you all to this special cultural performance on the eve of the 68th Republic Day of India. I recently came to Sri Lanka and presented my credentials to President Maithripala Sirisena. This is my first formal event as the High Commissioner. However, I have had the privilege of serving as a diplomat in Sri Lanka earlier, said High Commissioner Sandhu.
The High Commissioner praised Sri Lanka as a beautiful and friendly country and said that Sri Lanka remains close to his heart.
I look forward to renewing my old friendships and making new ones. I am delighted that on this special occasion, we are able to present before you an Odissi Dance Recital by the well- known group Rudrakshya from Odisha. India and Sri Lanka share cultural, religious, linguistic and civilizational ties that go back more than two millennium. An event as todays performance are a manifestation of the continuing close cultural ties between our two countries, pointed out High Commissioner Sandhu.
The High Commissioner also mentioned that Odissi comes from Odisha, the ancient land of Kalinga associated with Emperor Ashoka embracing Buddhism makes todays event particularly special.
It demonstrates that the strong links forged between our two countries since the time of Ven. Arahat Mahinda the son of Ashoka in fourth century B.C. continues today.
These bonds of friendship are underpinned by continuing people to people contacts. India remains the largest source of tourists for Sri Lanka, last year more than 350,000 Indian tourists visited Sri Lanka while more than 200,000 Sri Lankan tourists visited India. We have more than 150 flights a week between our two countries, explained High Commissioner Sandhu.
The two governments are working closely to deepen bilateral connectivity even further.
I am confident that our close cultural ties will continue to strengthen. The High Commission through the Indian Cultural Center has been showcasing to Sri Lanka audiences examples of Indian Culture and traditions. I look forward to many such events during my tenure as High Commissioner here in Sri Lanka. I also want to commend the hard work done by the Indian Cultural Center, added High Commissioner Sandhu.
Minister of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, Mano Ganesan delivered a short but thought-provoking speech.
Now it is the era of peace in Sri Lanka. It is a time of national co-existence and reconciliation. I believe our two countries can join hands. It is a win -win situation for India and Sri Lanka. India is booming economically and this can be reflected in Sri Lanka. We anticipate that there can be a free trade agreement, very soon. This too will be something positive for both our countries. I am a Sri Lankan and I am happiest at the prospects of relations between our two countries. Therefore, I believe an occasion like today is very important, said Ganesan.

## Title: Spice up your life!

Spice up your life!
Spices and herbs add delicious variety to the foods we eat. But spices and herbs are much more than flavor enhancers - they are nutritional powerhouses. After all, spices and herbs come from plants, which means they are sources of plant phytonutrients.
Many phytonutrients have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or even anti-cancer properties, and in the case of spices, these phytonutrients can be very concentrated. So spices do more than perk up the flavor of your food - they put a natural pharmacy in your kitchen.
For people, one perceived impediment to cooking with spices is the dislike of spicy food, even though spices are not spicy hot, per se. Spices can make food richly flavorful and aromatic, but they make it hot only if you add fresh, powdered or flaked chile peppers. That heat comes with a few benefits - spicy hot food reduces the need for salt, plus it helps the body sweat and potentially remove toxins.
A handful of spices have enjoyed an elevated status, thanks to their potential to help decrease inflammation in the body: cinnamon, garlic, ginger and turmeric. None of these is a magic bullet, of course, but because they also help make food more flavorful and satisfying, there no reason not to use more of them.
u Cinnamon's versatility lends itself to sweet and savory dishes. Add cinnamon to your breakfast oats, baked goods or meat marinades. Sprinkle it on roasted vegetables or sauteed leafy greens. Mix it into black bean dishes. Some initial studies claim that cinnamon helps to reduce blood glucose and bad cholesterol, but more research is needed.
u Garlic is technically a vegetable, even though few people eat it like one (the French writer Colette is one notable exception). Freshly peeled cloves are best, but you can buy prepacked frozen minced garlic. Garlic appears to benefit cardiovascular health.
u Ginger root is a cornerstone of Asian cooking, imparting a slightly sweet, slightly hot flavor. It goes well with garlic in many Thai, Indian, and Chinese dishes. Ginger can help ease nausea and may also relieve heartburn and bloating. Try a ginger and honey tea when you're under the weather, or add fresh or powdered ginger to smoothies. Fresh ginger root keeps in the fridge for several weeks, longer in the freezer.
u Turmeric is used in Indian and other dishes for flavor, and its intense bright orange color is known to stain kitchenware. Add turmeric to rice or to hot oil before sauteing onions and garlic. Add it to curry dishes, marinades and salad dressings. Recipes for turmeric tea abound online, or you can buy ready-to-go tea bags. When you use turmeric in savory dishes, use black pepper, too, because a compound in black pepper helps your body absorb turmeric's beneficial compounds.
When cooking time is in short supply, spices are an easy way to accentuate simply prepared whole foods such as fish, meat, chicken, vegetables, whole grains and lentils. You can even prepare spice rubs and pastes in advance so they are ready and waiting when it's time to pull a meal together.
One key reason that world cuisines taste different from each other is the distinctiveness offered by the herbs, spices and other aromatic ingredients that are traditional to each one. When you know which flavors are common to your favorite cuisines, you are well on your way to creating tasty dishes without following a recipe. For example, when you are craving Mexican food, you can cook beans and rice, grill some steak, chicken, or fish or bake some tofu, saute peppers and onions, and season to taste with cumin, lime juice, cilantro, salsa and hot sauce if you like it hot.
The spices and herbs you keep in your pantry will depend on your taste preferences, as well as your comfort level with using them. Here are some common ingredient combinations from a few popular cuisines:
u Chinese cuisine includes anise seed, bean paste, chile oil, garlic, ginger, green onions, hot red peppers, sesame oil and seeds, soy sauce and star anise.
u French cuisine includes bay leaves, black pepper, chervil, chives, fines herbs, garlic, marjoram, nutmeg, onions, parsley, pink and green peppercorns, rosemary, shallots, tarragon and thyme.

Sri Lanka economy rides out difficult year - OBG
The Sri Lankan economy rode out a difficult year in 2016, though government measures to curb spending and boost revenue may impact investment and expansion in the coming year.
According to IMF estimates issued at the end of October, Sri Lankas economy was forecast to close out 2016 with GDP growth of 5%. A similar rate of expansion is forecast for 2017, rising to 5.4% by the end of the decade.
A flat growth trajectory and the need to fund economic reform prompted the Sri Lankan government to broker an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the IMF, which authorised the provision of $1.5bn in loans over a three-year period.
Under the terms of the EFF, which came into effect at the beginning of June, the government committed to a programme of fiscal consolidation, revenue mobilisation, public financial management reform, state enterprise reform, a transition to flexible inflation targeting, and reforms to the trade and investment regime.
As part of these ongoing measures, the government plans to utilise public-private partnership models to bring efficiency and attract investment to some state-owned enterprises (SOEs), particularly in the tourism, financial services and utilities sectors. According to a report issued by local think tank the Advocata Institute in May, SOEs account for up to 80% of domestic debt.
The IMF released the second tranche of the EFF funding, worth $162.6m, in November after reporting that Sri Lanka had made progress in meeting the terms of the agreement despite challenging circumstances. The report also said that while international reserves were below comfortable levels, overall fiscal performance had been encouraging, with macroeconomic and financial conditions beginning to stabilise.
Budgetary tightening
The government has moved to meet the criteria of its IMF agreement by increasing taxes and reining in spending.Tabled in November, the budget aims for a deficit of 4.6% next year, compared to an estimated 5.4% in 2016. The government predicts that the gap will be narrowed via a 27% increase in tax revenues and by easing the pace of recurrent spending growth.
Among the measures to be enacted this year are higher levels of corporate and withholding taxes, a 10% capital gains tax to be introduced in April, a hike in value-added tax from 10% to 15%, and an increase in tax payable on earnings from funds, dividends, treasury bills and bonds from 10% to 14%.
While some of this new revenue will be used to scale down the deficit, the 2017 budget also foresees an increase in capital expenditure, with outlays next year of Rs 798bn ($5.3bn), up from LKR500bn ($3.3bn) in 2016.
Even with measures introduced to reduce the deficit, the government will enter 2017 with a high debt burden, according to a mid-November report by ratings agency Fitch, with 2016 year-end debt expected to be around 76.5% of GDP.
Borrowing under the 2017 budget will also rise, with the government expecting to tap international markets for LKR353bn ($2.4bn), equivalent to 2.6% of GDP, up from the 2016 total of LKR275bn ($1.8bn) or 2.2% of GDP.
Divested securities
Pressure on the Sri Lankan rupee and concerns over tax reforms to be implemented in the coming year saw investors divest government securities in the fourth quarter.
In the five weeks to November 16, foreign investors sold LKR37.1bn ($247.8m) worth of securities, with the outflow also linked to speculation of a rates rise by the US Federal Reserve.
Following the budget release investor concerns also spread to the Colombo Stock Exchange, whose main index dipped to 6242.68 points in late November, its lowest level since early April. The index has shed 2.77% since the budget was handed down, reflecting uncertainty over the impact of some of the governments proposed measures.
Risks of a potential shift in investor sentiment were flagged by Fitch in February, when it downgraded Sri Lankas long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings from BB- to to B+, assigning both a negative outlook. These risks could be mitigated by a greater degree of stability in policy and in tighter fiscal controls and reforms, the agency said.
Rates raised
While average inflation remained below the 4% target in 2016, to help tackle point-to-point inflation  which peaked at 6.4% in June  the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in July upped both its standing deposit facility rate and standing lending facility rate by 50 basis points each, to 7% and 8.5%, respectively.
This was the second rate hike of the year, with the regulator having raised its lending rate from 7.5% to 8% in February.
Following the rate increases, growth in credit to the private sector from commercial banks decelerated to 27.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) in August, down from 28.5% a month previously. Most recent figures show that in October, private credit was LKR79bn ($526.8m)  a 22% decrease y-o-y  with total private credit granted in the first 10 months of the year hitting Rs 594 bn ($4bn).
With the aim of bringing y-o-y expansion down to below 20%, in December the IMF called on the central bank to remain poised to raise rates further if credit growth did not show signs of further deceleration.

Sri Lanka yet to reap benefits from EU fish ban lift
Though the European Commission (EC) fish ban imposed on Sri Lanka in 2015 was lifted last year by the EU, Sri Lanka has not yet reaped benefits from it.
Sri Lanka Canned Fish Producers Association President, Shiran Fernando said they still have to pay a duty component of 16.5% for fish exports. First we salute the lifting of the fish ban and thank the Sri Lankan government and the EU which has made exports possible after two years.
However the real time benefits can come only when the GSP Plus is fully implemented as it is only then that the 16.5% duty will be taken off.
CEO and Director TESS Group Shiran Fernando
Fernando said today Sri Lanka has lost its market advantage due to the two year ban. Countries like Maldives have taken our place and even the customers have got used to their products. Hence we now have now to reposition Sri Lankas fish in the international market which is a tall order.
He said that during the EU fish ban Sri Lanka fish exporters faced tremendous hardships and several companies retrenched their staff as margins fell by big numbers.
Fernando who is also the CEO and Director of TESS Group of Companies exports fish for the past 35 years said that it is very sad that Sri Lanka being an island and having one of the biggest sea areas (517,000 square kilometers) which is bigger than the worlds largest fish producing country, Thailands fishing area) is still importing fish at an annual expense of Rs. 9,6 billion mainly from China in canned form.
He said the irony is that Sri Lanka is not reaping full benefits from the sea and he said that fish are dying of old age in the East with no takers. This is one of the main reasons for fishermen from other countries to fish in Lankan waters.
He said fishing is the only industry that had a readymade market in Sri Lanka everyday and no one should have second thoughts to invest in it.
Fernando said the government recently at a special appointed committee comprising Ministers, Mahinda Amaraweera, Rajitha Senaratne, Ravi Karunanayake, Rishard Bathiudeen and Dr. Sarath Amunugama came up with the idea to offer an incentive payment of Rs. 25 for each Mackerel can sold at Lanka Sathosa during the time when Kiran Attaputtu was its Chairman. This was very good step as it saved the four Sri Lankan producers.
He said that Sri Lanka is the largest importer of canned fish from China which is being sold in super markets at low prices. Due to this move we are now able to match their price.
He also said that the government must now request government institutions like the Armed Forces, and hospitals to buy local products to encourage and safeguard local producers.
He said that given this kind of encouragement, Sri Lanka can be not only be self sufficient in fish but be one of the biggest fish exporters in the world.
This will help the fishing industry to be the biggest foreign exchange earner to Sri Lanka.

Statement by SAITM Chairman - Dr Neville Fernando: We urge authorities to respect and uphold the law
We laud the recent landmark decision of the Court of Appeal (CR/WRIT/187/2016), on the threshold of the countrys Independence Day celebrations, allowing SAITM MBBS graduates the right of provisional registration, states SAITM Chairman Dr Neville Fernando in a release. The release adds:
SAITM has come a long way on its journey of providing higher education to the youth of this country.
SAITM was recognized as a Degree Awarding Institute by an order published in Gazette Extraordinary No. 1721/19 dated 30/11/2011 and No. 1829/36 dated 26/09/2013, in terms of Section 25A of the Universities Act of 1978 and tabled in Parliament, to award the degree Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS).
The journey has been filled with obstacles from its inception. I signed an MOU with the Western Provincial Council to provide clinical training at the Avissawella and Homagama Hospitals for the medical students of SAITM for which SAITM was willing to allocate funds to improve these hospitals.
However, the GMOA protested and we were unable to implement the MOU. I was not deterred by these obstacles placed before SAITM by the GMOA. I built a hospital spending Rs. 2 billion to provide clinical training for my students. However,there were some training components that were available only in a government hospital, which the students of SAITM requested the Ministry of Health to provide them. Although the Minister of Health agreed in Courts to provide such training, this training did not materialize due to undue pressure from trade unions. The students had no option but to go to Courts against the Minister, charging him for Contempt of Court. The students were successful, when the Minister of Health agreed in Courts to provide access to Government hospitals in January 2016.
The first batch of students passed out in May 2016 and applied for provisional registration from the SLMC to undergo internship training. The SLMC refused to accept their applications. This led to another legal battle with the SLMC, where a graduate from SAITM challenged the SLMC in the Court of Appeal. Justice Vijith Malalgoda (PC) and S. Thurairajah (PC) of the Court of Appeal, in the landmark decision made on January 31, 2017, directed that provisional registration be allowed for SAITM MBBS graduates.
SAITM has always trusted the legal system of Sri Lanka and will take all necessary measures to ensure that the directives of the Court are upheld and that our students are treated fairly and given equal opportunity to practice as doctors in Sri Lanka.

Trump gets his Secretary of State but other fights loom
US: President Donald Trump notched a victory Wednesday with Rex Tillerson anointed as his secretary of state, but opposition Democrats girded for battle over other nominations, including his US Supreme Court pick.
The Senate confirmed Tillerson, the former chief executive of oil giant ExxonMobil, by a vote of 56 to 43, before he was sworn in at the White House.
Democrats had argued Tillersons lack of government experience and ties to Russia would not serve US diplomatic interests well. But four Democrats ultimately joined all 52 Republicans voting in favor.
With Tillerson sworn in, Trump has another key member of his national security team in place, along with his defense and homeland security secretaries and CIA director.
This is a man that is respected all over the world before he even begins, Trump said at the White House, thanking Tillerson. He left a very good job for this, I want to tell you.
But battles loomed on Capitol Hill over other key nominees including education secretary-designate Betsy DeVos, with two Republicans crossing the aisle to oppose her, and Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch, who was introduced late Tuesday at the White House.
Hell be approved very quickly, Trump said of Gorsuch, who would fill the seat on the high court left empty since conservative justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.
But that confidence belies what looks to be a tough confirmation fight in the Republican-controlled Senate, after Trumps party refused for much of last year to fill the vacant court seat with Barack Obamas nominee.
Trump is pushing for Senate Republicans led by Mitch McConnell to prevent a likely Democratic filibuster by using what is known as the nuclear option.
That procedure would change Senate rules to push Gorsuch through with a simple majority in the 100-seat chamber rather than a supermajority of 60 votes. Republicans hold 52 Senate seats.
If we end up with that gridlock I would say, If you can, Mitch, go nuclear, Trump said.
Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer pushed right back.
The answer should not be to change the rules of the Senate, but to change the nominee to someone who can earn 60 votes, Schumer said. McConnell has not revealed whether he would seek to invoke the nuclear option.
The acrimonious row over Trumps ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries has further complicated efforts to get his nominees confirmed.
Democrats have vowed to slow-walk confirmation votes.
Their boycott of votes on two Trump picks was dramatically overturned when leaders of the Senate Finance Committee suspended the panels rules and approved the nominees for Treasury -- Steven Mnuchin -- and health -- Tom Price -- with no Democrats present.
The provocative move stoked already simmering tensions in Congress.
They broke the rules to advance the confirmation of two ethically flawed nominees, the committees top Democrat Ron Wyden told reporters.
I think its a big mistake.
Democrats also boycotted a committee vote for Scott Pruitt, Trumps choice to head the Environmental Protection Agency, prompting Republican Senator Jerry Moran to brand it governing by tantrum. Democrats were not the only ones expressing concerns.
Two Senate Republicans, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, announced their opposition to DeVos, bringing her nomination to the brink of defeat in what would be an embarrassment for the new president.
DeVos is a wealthy donor who has pushed hard for charter schools but whose positions on public education has drawn criticism. Despite the DeVos hiccup and Democratic obstruction, Trumps attorney general pick Jeff Sessions was finally approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday following delays. A final confirmation vote has not yet been set. The Supreme Court nomination is likely to be a protracted fight. - AFP
