Dismal performances by Lankans in Rio
RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday: Sri Lanka painted a dismal picture as all three of its competitors seen in action on Monday were eliminated from their respective events on day four of the Olympic Games here.
Shooter Mangala Samarakoon came out with the worst ever performance in his international career, finishing last out of 50 competitors who took part in mens 10m air rifle qualification round.
His second successive Olympics turned out to be a nightmare for Samarakoon who had a poor aggregate of 589.6 while all other shooters went beyond 600.
Italian Niccolo Camprini finished on top with a total of 630.2 - a new Olympic record. In the second place was Viadmir Maslennikov of Russia with 629.0, followed by Peter Gorsa of Croatia who scored 628.0.
Weightlifter Sudesh Peiris fared no better in his mens 62kg group B qualifier. Although he opted to start his snatch lifts from 120kg, he failed in all three attempts to crash out of the competition.
Vaipava Nevo Ioane (SAM) who started his lifts at 115kg finished on top of this group with a snatch of 120kg and clean and jerk of 161kg to total 281kg.
The only Sri Lankan competitor to show some form was judoka Chamara Nuean Dharmawardena who secured ninth place in his weight class. He was eliminated at the pre-quarter finals of the mens 73kg category.
However, he beat Benjamin Waterhouse of American Samoa in the qualifying round before losing to Lisha Shavdatuashvili of Geirgia in the pre-quarter finals.

Armand Flamer Caldera wins coveted title in Play-off
Sixteen-year-old Armand Flamer Caldera played brilliant golf on the final day to card a gross 73. He was 5 strokes behind leader Vinod going in to the last round and then he piled on the pressure being 1 under Par after 10 holes, quickly closing in on Vinod. Eventually Armands Par Round gross 73 to Vinods 5 over forced a sudden death play-Off in the Gold Division (15 -17 years).
It was an exciting play off, where both players were matching shot to shot but Armand proved his supremacy by winning the coveted title of Prima Regional Junior Champion in the Gold Division. Over 70 juniors compete for top honors at the championship at the Victoria Golf and Country Resort, Kandy. Januka Dilshan who came with a good last round score,however had to settle for 2nd runner-up. T. Akash went on to take the 3rd runner-up trophy with a total score of 175.
In the Silver Division (age group category 12  14 years) playing 18 holes, experienced Taniya Minel Balasuriya enjoyed a comfortable win, playing consistent golf over the two days with an aggregate score of 167. Both P.A Dimuthu and Dhuvarshan were tied on 175 but Dimuthu went on to be 1st runner-up on the count back and Dhuvarshan ended as 2nd runner-up. Kayla Perera secured 3rd runner-up with an aggregate score of 180.
In the Bronze Division (age group category 10  11 years) playing 13 holes, we saw Sherin Mithara recorded a comfortable win with a total score of 119 over Nirekh Tejwani with a total score of 122 over two days of play. Followed by Yannik Kumara who improved on the second day but failed to close the leader gap and had to settle for 2nd runner-up with a total score of 128. The youngster K. Danushan with a total score of 133 became 3rd runner-up. We are likely to see the talent pool blossoming in this division with the maturity of the young golfers.
In the Copper Division (Age Group 09 & under) playing 9 holes Shanal Binuksha won by 7 shots with a score of 85 and took the most junior category win in style. Kvahn Tejwani was 1st runner-up with a total score of 92. For 2nd and 3rd runner-up place we saw a battle between Musa Shariff of UAE and Pranav Muralidaran. However Musa with total score of 102 got the better of Pranav who had 105.

## Title: Doping war as King beats tainted Russian swimmer to gold

Doping war as King beats tainted Russian swimmer to gold
Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday: American teenager Lilly King celebrated stopping tainted Russian swimmer Yulia Efimova from getting an Olympic gold as doping hostilities worsened in Rio.
King was joined by US legend Michael Phelps and other swimmers in calling for tougher action on the use of banned substances.
Efimova, who won an appeal at the world sports tribunal to get her place in Rio, and Chinas Sun Yang, who won the 200m freestyle on Monday, were the main targets of the attacks.
Efimova, 24, was booed as she entered the pool area and was left in tears after being narrowly beaten by King in the womens 100m breaststroke final.
I think it just proved that you can compete clean and still come out on top, King said of her win. She had criticized Efimova before the race.
The Russian broke down in tears as she came to face journalists.
I once made a mistake and served my ban, she said, referring to a 16-month suspension incurred after testing positive for a banned steroid in 2014.
She was given a provisional ban this year after testing positive for meldonium but that was overturned in May by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The second time was not my mistake. I dont know how to make people understand. If yogurt gets banned and youre positive, is that your fault
Following the Richard McLaren report for the World Anti-Doping Agency, Efimova was suspended again. The report implicated the Russian government in doping. But another appeal to the CAS last week let Efimova and six other Russian swimmers into Rio. The United States and other western countries had wanted a complete ban on Russian athletes. US competitors have been outspoken about their Russian rivals.
Phelps, who will go for a record 20th gold medal on Tuesday, backed King and said those punished for doping should not be allowed back in the sport.
I think youre going to see a lot of people speaking up more, the all-time highest Olympic medal winner said. I think shes right, something needs to be done.
Sun has already been at the center of a verbal battle with Australias Mack Horton who beat Sun in the 400m race. After winning the mens 200m freestyle title, the Chinese hero, who was banned for three months in 2014, came under attack from French swimmer Camille Lacourt.
Sun Yang, he pisses purple, Lacourt told French radio after his race. When I see the 200m podium I want to be sick.
I am very sad when I see my sport getting like this. I have the impression I am watching athletics, with two or three doped in each final, added Lacourt, a medal hope who came fifth in the 100m backstroke.
The Sun-Horton dispute has turned into a social media war. Chinas state-controlled Global Times newspaper called Australia a former British offshore prison because of Hortons drug cheat remarks about Sun.
The International Olympic Committee tried to ease tensions saying the Olympics was about respecting the right of others to compete.
Swimmings war of words overshadowed a day of competition that saw a first gold medal for the Brazilian hosts. It was won by judoka Rafaela Silva, who grew up in Rios notorious City of God slum. Silva upset world number one Sumiya Dorjsuren in the 57kg final for a hugely welcome win for Brazil after apathy and protests in the run-up to South Americas first Olympics.
China got more medals in diving, where Chen Aisen and Lin Yue won the mens 10m platform. China finished the day with five gold medals in total.
Japans King Kohei Uchimura led Japan to victory in the mens team gymnastics, completing his collection of major titles in the sport. Russia took gold and silver in the womens sabre fencing as Yana Egorian beat Sofiya Velikaya, who again suffered heartbreak after also losing the 2012 Olympic final.
Thailand enjoyed a one-two in the womens 58kg weightlifting as Sukanya Srisurat beat Pimsiri Sirikaew by 8kg.
In rugby, Australias women beat New Zealand to become the Olympics first rugby sevens champions, prompting a tearful departing haka by the beaten Kiwis. AFP

Iron Lady snares second gold
Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday: Hungary's Katinka Hosszu said she felt in "great shape" on Monday as she powered to her second gold medal of the Rio Olympics -- and stayed on track for three more.
Hosszu, dubbed the "Iron Lady" for her renowned stamina, won the 100m backstroke in 58.45sec, ahead of American Kathleen Baker, as Canadian Kylie Masse and China's Fu Yuanhui finished in a dead heat for bronze. Hosszu, who returned little more than an hour later to book her spot in Tuesday's 200m medley final, said she wasn't feeling any pressure from her heavy schedule, which also includes the 200m backstroke and 200m butterfly. On Saturday, the 27-year-old shattered the 400m individual medley world record for her first ever Olympic title.
"I was already very relaxed before the 400IM which was surprising for me," said Hosszu, who arrived in Rio in search of her first Olympic medal.
"I have been racing so much in the past four years that that was kind of my goal that when we get to Rio it would kind of be second nature and it really feels that way.
"I know I've done the 400IM and the 100 back a million times and now I'm fresh and in great shape," she added. Hosszu was sixth at the turn with world champion Emily Seebohm of Australia leading.
She roared home as Seebohm failed not only to improve on the silver she won in London but faded to finish a disappointing seventh.
"I can't believe I won the 100 back," Hosszu said. "I dreamt about it, but I could have done eighth, it's so close."
Seebohm, swimming in unfavorable lane seven after a lackluster semi-final performance, was left looking for answers after coming into the Games with the top time of 2016.
"I definitely wanted to take it out (fast) and obviously it hurt a bit on the back end," she said. "I did a fantastic warm-up. I couldn't have done anything differently.
"My semi needed to be better so I could be in an inside land and have someone to push me," she concluded. AFP

Colombias Figueroa strikes gold, retires
Rio de Janeiro, Tuesday: Colombian weightlifter Oscar Figueroa struck Olympic gold on Monday and then immediately retired capping a rollercoaster few months after he was given a suspended prison sentence for car crime.
The 33-year-old, who once fled fighting by Colombian rebels, fell to his knees and burst into tears after lifting 318kg in an enthralling and emotionally-charged mens 62kg.
Figueroa, silver medallist in London 2012 four years ago, kissed the barbell and removed his shoes to signify that he was retiring as he sobbed his eyes out for several minutes in front of an adoring Colombian crowd. I cant describe how it feels right now.
Ive been lifting weights for 22 years and its time to retire. Thats why I took my shoes off, Figueroa told reporters afterwards. Figueroa ran foul of the law back in June when he was given a 16-month suspended sentence, put on probation for two years and fined $468 for his involvement in falsely reporting a car theft.
According to his lawyer, he bought the car for a friend, who then sold it and claimed it had been stolen, before Figueroa reported the theft to the police.
Figueroa said the criminal proceedings had not dogged his preparations for Rio, telling a press conference that he wanted to move on from the incident.
It was not a distraction but Im here to give good news and to transmit happiness. Im quite tired of violence. Im not sure why the press keep repeating these negative questions. I really dont want to be the bearer of bad news. I want to transmit good news, he said.
Figueroa hauled 142kg above his head in the snatch, following up with a 176 in the clean and jerk to beat silver medallist Eko Yuli Irawan of Indonesia by 6kg. After Irawan failed to jerk 179kg in his final lift, the gold medal was Figueroas with an attempt to spare. Figueroa then tried the same lift to break his Olympic record set four years ago but couldnt muster the strength.
Nevertheless, he fell to his knees and burst into tears as the 2,000-strong partisan Colombian crowd, which had celebrated every failed lift by any of his opponents, roared in delight. AFP

Australia crowned first womens rugby sevens champions
Rio de Janeiro, Monday: Australia were crowned the first ever Olympic rugby sevens champions after beating New Zealand 24-17 in the final of the womens tournament in Rio on Monday.
The favourites outscored the Kiwis by four tries to three, two of them crucially coming either side of half-time when star New Zealand winger Portia Woodman was in the sin bin for a deliberate knock-on.
The tournament marked the first time since 1924 that rugby has been played at the Olympics and the debut for sevens, the previous four incarnations featuring mens 15-a-side tournaments. New Zealand, who beat Britain 25-7 in the semi-final, opened the scoring through barn-storming centre Kayla McAlister, sister of Toulouse-based former All Black Luke.
In a hard-hitting encounter, Kiwi sweeper Tyla Nathan-Wong tracked back superbly to drag down Australian flyer Emma Tonegato with the line beckoning. But Tonegato was on hand from a resulting penalty to scramble over in the corner to draw the scores level.
Woodman was yellow carded on the stroke of half-time and Australia immediately capitalised, Evania Pelite sprinting down the left flank to take her side into a 10-5 lead.
The final, played out under the watchful eyes of World Rugby president Bill Beaumont and assorted rugby illuminati, proved to be a compelling match featuring the two best sides by far in the competition, both having displayed fitness levels and skillsets largely superior to the 10 other teams.
That was shown to startling effect three minutes into the second-half as the outstanding Charlotte Caslick combined with Emilee Cherry to put Ellia Green away for Australias third try, with Chloe Dalton converting.
Caslick, whose mazy running has made her one of the most dangerous players in the tournament, slid over for her own deserved try shortly after, Dalton again converting.
McAlister grabbed her second with less than two minutes to play while Woodman, the all-time leading try-scorer in World Rugby Womens Sevens Series history having scored 119 tries over four seasons, took her tournament tally to a leading 10 with a consolation effort on the hooter. AFP

Silva from the favela gets Brazils first gold
Rio de Janeiro,Tuesday: A female athlete from the favelas won Brazils first gold medal of the Rio Games on Monday as Michael Phelps stepped up his campaign for yet more Olympic honours.
Rafaela Silva, who grew up in Rios notorious City of God slum, upset world number one Sumiya Dorjsuren to win the womens under-57kg judo, sparking pandemonium among fans.
Silva sank to her knees in delight after a win that jump-starts Brazils Olympic campaign and secures only their second medal after Felipe Wus shooting silver.
Its great for kids who are watching judo now. Seeing someone like me who left the City of God, who started judo at five years of age as a joke, said Silva.
To be world champion and Olympic champion is something inexplicable.
Earlier Phelps, who grabbed his 19th Olympic gold medal late on Sunday, was back in action as he eased into the semi-finals of his signature event, the 200m butterfly.
I probably got to sleep at 3:00 am and was on an 11:00 am bus, so quick turn-arounds, Phelps said. But the good thing is we have a long time between the prelims and finals, so we are able to rest. AFP
