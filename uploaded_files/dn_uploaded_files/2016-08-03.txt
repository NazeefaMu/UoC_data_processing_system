Kabali: hilarious definition of heroism
I had the opportunity to view the film of the matinee idol of Tamil Nadu- now in his sixties but still considered 'super star' and the highest paid in Tamil Nadu Rajni Kanth's Kabali'. My mind went back to fifties - as a child of eleven or twelve. It was the first day first show of 'Kabali at the Colombo Cinema and it was a single show at 4 pm only. I was able to witness the anxious crowds in the queue, holding each others shoulders in order not to miss his place in the queue.
I was a bit disturbed by an elderly Muslim film buff, who was always trying to get in front of me! I offered my place willingly to him to show my generosity; But not a word of thanks! Anyway I was lucky enough to get a ticket in the ODC. It was in 'G' row, the first seat in the right, three seats from mine were not occupied. Somebody came and tried to sit in one of the seats "No, you can't sit in this seat! I have kept it aside for my family members The newcomer argued. He said: Dont you see the back rows The theatre management has kept Reserved cards The other seats like this are free to all Anybody can sit anywhere! All of a sudden a call to the cellular phone. Where are you Where In bus Traffic
Frame one
While he was at it, the film show began. Still the fellow was trying to call his beloved ones!
A thundering applaud and uproar Clapping! Hooting!! It was a mix up of the uproar and the sound of the film track After the titles the film frame No. 1, a close up of man's feet wearing a pointed shoe The sound track was thundering! And the film audience was uproaring! During the first 20 minutes Rajni Kanth's full frame appeared on the screen, it was only the echo of sounds! Was it a planned promotion campaign or was it really something happened by heart and soul
From there onwards it was fast run new model cars going on some highways, slamming the enemychitty chitty bang bang People get killed like flies! Or they run after each other like rats, cats or dogs! Isn't there a police protection No, they come to the scene after it is all over!
Technically perfect. The sound track is uproaring. There was some dialogue about the pride of the Tamil nationality. And what happens in the film
Post-mortem arrival
Towards the end of the first half the hero gets killed His fianc also gets killed brutally. The fianc delivers a baby in the second half on the mortuary table She didn't have a big belly according to what we saw! And the baby is born after her death And the funniest thing of all 
The hero is back too! Hindu Myth Some believe that even Ravan is alive!
Then the Big War! It's all chitty chitty Bang bangThen after that lots of explosions! Lot of killings! At times the screen is filled with exploded glass pieces! Like some scattered flowers.
Ultimately the hero is the successor. When people say he is a hero. The hero, Kabali, says I am a rowdy!
South Indian Cinema's explanation of heroism'. It's a happy ending.
All are happy and got the ultimate satisfaction of entertainment. It's not an easy task to get the audience into cinema theatres.
It's a huge gambling. Majority of our film-makers are influenced by the South Indian Cinema since 1947. Still it prevails!
"Kabali" is a film which takes the South Indian cinema to its heights. Masses are entertained in many countries. Essentially it's Indian whether we agree or not!

Live the song
Priya Peiris needs hardly any introduction among music fans of the sixties. Famed for cock-a-doodle-doo, Priya Peiris came long journey in music career. La Bambas music troupe, founded by him made waves in music of the sixties. Retired from government service, Priya Peiris is yet to bid farewell to his beloved subject: music.
Q: So, you will be celebrating half century with La Bambas group
A: Yes, we started it in 1966. In 2016, however we have no big plans. We will be launching a CD.
Q: You have mentioned that there is a remarkable difference in music and instruments of your group.
A: We will never go to electronic guitars though it is electronic era. It is only box guitars, shakers and another a set of clappers which give (tuck tuck) sound synchronizing. This particular CD comprises many Latin American, Calipso, Cowboy, Spanish and a few other songs of different languages. For English and Sinhala songs, we make our own lyrics to suit our own music. Foreign songs include La Paloma', 'Cielito lindo' , 'El Rancho grande', 'Sol a mente una vez', 'Pepito mi corazon, 'MI cafetal, 'El bayon' (theme song from the 1953 movie Anna)', 'Yo vendo unos ojos negros', 'Nube Gris' , 'Las Mananitas', Adios Mariquita Linda' and Calypsos such as 'Melody d' amor' and English numbers are 'Sloop John B', 'Yellow Bird', 'River of the roses', 'Sweet Rosy Ann' along with a few English originals.
Q: You initiated your career at Radio Ceylon. How did it influence you
A: First it was Radio Club. Vijeya Corea and I were the first to play to DX TV. We were a group. We were the only group that entertained the wounded soldiers at the Army Hospital during the period of ethnic conflict in 1980s.
I was a Thomian. When the seniors were singing in the church choir we little ones were made to sit in the front when they harmonized. I copied the style, then the teachers later made me join the harmonizing group whom were really honored by the whole school as only few could harmonize and I was one of them.
Q: Your group was quite popular in the sixties and it increased when you sang Cock-a-Doodle-Doo.
A: We were nicknamed as cock-a-doodle boys. Unlike other groups, we never had bookings. We were invited to sing at cocktail parties and functions in many Embassies, as we were singing songs in 15 languages! We signed a contract with Hotel Oberoi for 15 long years! The foreigners were really impressed. My song Cock-a-Doodle was a great hit in 1960s.
Q: Along with that fame, you must have unforgettable memories too
A: Yes. We used to go to camps in Northern and Eastern Provinces during the Ethnic conflicts to offer entertainment to the gloomy solders. We travelled there and started training them to sing, play instruments. It was a great pleasure.
Q: Do you still havethe old records
A: We have records of all our songs sung at that time which were recorded by Paradise Record Bar, Philip, Suriya and Mc Clarence. At that time there were no CDs. There were only records. Lak Nadee, Enna Yanna Nelum Vile Nelum Kadanna, Kurulan Piyambala and many more which became great hits.

UTE-CAT helps Powerlifting Olympic aspirant Darin Weerasinghe
Darin Weerasinghe, Sri Lankas reigning Powerlifting champions recent win at the Asian Powerlifting Championships in India has paved the way for what many would call an impossible dream participating in an Olympics Game.
Having set his sights on the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Darin has to qualify through three rounds in his pet sport, 120kg Powerlifting (three lifts, not the customary two as in Weightlifting) which is set to debut as a medal sport during the 2020 Olympics.
He says, There are three rounds of qualifications. I have passed the first round with two more later. The World Championship will be held next year in August and the final next round at the end of 2018, two years before the Olympics.
As an Olympic hopeful Weerasinghe is undeterred at what many would believe to be an insurmountable task, The biggest hurdle was to pass the first one.
While achieving this milestone with professional stride, he acknowledges that his participation in the Games will probably go down as a first in the countrys history.
Darins success in the sporting arena is not limited to powerlifting. He is also a prominent racing driver and a motorcar racing champion. Supporting him to live his sporting dreams is United Tractor & Equipment (Pvt) Ltd (UTE), the sole authorized dealer for CAT construction equipment and power generators in Sri Lanka.
I have been sponsored by UTE for five years now, they have been sponsoring my motor racing and have helped me a lot in motor racing. They also came in as a sponsor for my weight lifting and power lifting too. They continue to back me up and have been a really good sponsor, Darin says.
While the road to 2020 seems long, Darins unflagging optimism is tempered with common sense, he says We (himself and Sri Lankas other Powerlifting Olympic aspirant Ransilu Jayathilake) have a four year gap and hope to take it step by step by progressing and getting results.
He struck silver at his first competition, in 2010 - the Sri Lanka Power Lifting Nationals and from then onwards continued from strength to strength. Darin says I have been winning pretty much everything I have participated in including powerlifting invitationals held in Singapore. He is also a holder of four national records.
Darin is on track to become Sri Lankas first Olympic participant in a strength sport.
Darin has few words of advice for Olympic aspirants, One thing we learnt by going for international competitions is if you want to be at the top, discipline is the most important thing, you have to be consistent. Set yourself realistic goals and most of all enjoy what you are doing.
UTE who has been at the forefront of the tough construction equipment and power generation business in Sri Lanka with the world renowned Caterpillar brand has found a great Brand Ambassador in Darin who represents strength, fitness, discipline and efficiency. All these qualities are in the UTE-CAT combination that is Built for It and we know our journey with Darin will continue, quoted Prasan Fernando, President of UTE.

Injured Lakmal dropped from Test squad : Lanka ponder changes in batting order
Sri Lanka who are one-up in the three-Test series against Australia are contemplating a change in the batting order especially with the openers.
For the past two years Sri Lanka has gone with Dimuth Karunaratne and Kaushal Silva as openers, but over a period of time it has been established that neither of them are attacking players.
The pair does not carry the fight to the opposing bowlers and thereby badly exposes Sri Lankas middle order to the new ball.
In England although they fought hard under extreme conditions they were unsuccessful in seeing the England new ball bowlers Anderson, Broad and Finn off until the third and final Test at Lords where they figured in a century partnership only their third in 20 Tests.
We have a few options up our sleeves and opening with Kusal Perera is one of them, said chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya. If we decide to open with Kusal then Dimuth will bat at number three.
That would mean that Kusal Mendis will come in at number four  the position where he scored that monumental match-winning knock of 176 followed by skipper Angelo Mathews and wicket-keeper/bat Dinesh Chandimal.
In his heyday Jayasuriya, a plunderer of runs formed Sri Lankas most successful Test opening partnership with the resilient Marvan Atapattu.
Kusal Perera has been compared more or less to Jayasuriya the way he bats but he has still a long way to go before filling in the great mans shoes. He has shone only in patches and so far has lacked in consistency.
Jayasuriya said that he has had chats with Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews about making changes to the top order batting but nothing has so far been finalized.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews said after the Pallekele post-match press conference that they had tried out Kusal Perera as opener with Silva to wipe out as much of the deficit quickly as possible but the ploy didnt work when Perera was dismissed for four. However Mathews didnt rule out using Perera as an opener during the series.
LAKMAL OUT OF SQUAD
Despite the mounting number of injuries Sri Lanka has decided to stick to the same squad. The only change is that injured fast bowler Suranga Lakmal who has a hamstring strain has been omitted from the squad that was named for the first Test at Pallekele thus reducing it to 14.
Sri Lanka won the first Test by 106 runs to take a 1-0 lead in the three-match Test series.
Jayasuriya said that Nuwan Pradeep, the latest casualty in the Lankan camp is due to undergo a fitness test today.
If Pradeep who damaged his hamstring doesnt come through the fitness test one of the two uncapped fast bowlers in the squad is likely to make his Test debut  Vishwa Fernando or Asitha Fernando, both of them with very little first-class experience. Vishwa has appeared in 44 first-class matches while 18-year-old Asitha has played in only two.
In the Pallakele Test, Pradeep bowled only six of the 88.3 overs in Australias second innings dominated by the spinners.
SRI LANKA TEST SQUAD FOR GALLE: Kaushal Silva, Dimuth Karunaratne, Kusal Perera, Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews (captain), Dinesh Chandimal, Dhananjaya de Silva, Dilruwan Perera, Rangana Herath, Lakshan Sandakan, Nuwan Pradeep, Vishwa Fernando, Asitha Fernando, Roshen Silva.

Australias oldest Olympian dies, aged 95
SYDNEY, TUESDAY  Legendary Australian swimming coach Forbes Carlile, who later competed at the Olympics in the modern pentathlon, died Tuesday aged 95, officials said.
Carlile became the nation's first post-war Olympics swim coach in 1948, and again coached the Australian squad at the 1956 games, before becoming the team's scientific adviser for the 1960 Olympics.
He is the only Australian to have gone to the Olympics first as a coach and then as an athlete, when in 1952 he competed in the modern pentathlon at Helsinki, the Australian Olympic Committee said.
The passing of Forbes Carlile is incredibly sad and our thoughts are with his wife Ursula, Australia's Olympic chef de mission Kitty Chiller said in a statement.
He was a true legend in Australian Olympic history as both an athlete and a coach.
During his career, Carlile worked with swimmers who captured 12 Olympic medals -- including five individual gold -- and 31 individual world records, the AOC said.
Carlile studied human physiology at the University of Sydney and pioneered work on elite athlete training methods, writing several books on competitive swimming.
He will be sadly missed by the whole swimming community, the Australian Swimming Coaches and Teachers Association said in a statement.
The veteran coach, who was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in the United States in 1977, last month became Australia's oldest surviving Olympian with the passing of fencer Helen Joy Hordon on July 28. AFP

Zimbabwe - Sri Lanka Tests could be replaced by tri-series
Just as Zimbabwe are getting back to Test cricket, they face the prospect of another lengthy stint without matches in the longest format. It is learnt that Sri Lanka's tour of Zimbabwe in October-November, pencilled into the FTP as two Tests, three ODIs and a T20I, may instead consist of a triangular ODI series featuring Sri Lanka and West Indies.
A source said that Zimbabwe never really intended for Sri Lanka to play Tests as it is not financially viable, and that a three-team, fifty-over competition is definitely being planned.
Should that happen, Zimbabwe could go without Tests for another 11 months, with their next Tests scheduled as away matches in Sri Lanka in July 2017. They will also go 14 months without home Tests, until West Indies visit in October 2017. Already, Zimbabwe have gone 20 months without a Test - the gap between their series against Bangladesh in 2014 and the ongoing series against New Zealand - and almost two years without a Test at home, since last hosting South Africa in August 2014.
The costs of a home tour for Zimbabwe Cricket (ZC) are crippling, not only because of their growing debt, but because of the economic situation in the country as a whole. With businesses struggling to survive, ZC battle for local sponsorship. They only turn a profit when hosting India or England, but luckily have had two successive years of limited-overs cricket against India to tide them over so far.
Still, Zimbabwe are battling to meet the costs involved in running the domestic game. The franchise system has been dismantled and there is a move back to provincial cricket, which has been divided into a two-tier structure. ZC has also gone through a restructure which has involved several retrenchments and salary cuts, and it is still in discussions over how to structure player contracts.

Speaker certifies RTI Bill into law
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya certified the Right to Information (RTI) Bill into law on Monday, co-cabinet spokesman and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatileka said yesterday.
Minister Karunatileka addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department said the delay was due to the Speaker having left to Singapore recently.
While the RTI Bill itself was passed in Parliament on June 24, there was criticism that it had not been passed into law. The Act also stipulates that its contents needs to come into effect six months after having been made into law.
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) in a statement released to the media earlier this week urged the Speaker to act on RTI or to inform the public of the reasons for any further delay.
TISL is conscious of the time needed to accommodate Committee Stage amendments, but in light of the fact that nearly all amendments had been pre-drafted, TISL believed a lapse of over a month is unwarranted. In delaying the certification of the Bill, the entire process of rolling out the RTI infrastructure is put on hold, including the setting up of the RTI Commission, the appointment and training of Information Officers, Designated Officers and Commissioners, and the sensitisation of the entire public service, the TISL statement added.

Govt. to ensure quality elder care
The government is taking action to ensure quality elder care throughout the country, a joint press release issued by the Prime Ministers Office and the National Secretariat for Elders said yesterday.
The release adds: The demand for elder care services is inadequately fulfilled or fulfilled in an unstructured manner.
The National Secretariat for Elders and the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister has developed a curriculum for training Elder Care Assistants.
This pilot project aims to: train and provide quality Elder Care Assistants to reach the specified standards; ensure elder care needs are met; promote professional, safe, and caring elder care givers; ensure quality assured standardised processes nationwide.
The development of the curriculum has included consultation with the National Secretariat for Elders, Helpage, Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC), National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) and the Vocational Training Authority (VTA).
The initial programme will consist of 112 hours of classroom, role play and practical internships. The programme will be conducted in a structured and progressive manner to enable the Elder Care Assistants to acquire skills that will be in demand in Sri Lanka and overseas.
Training is supported by a training manual with a scientific approach to care giving, including physical, psychological, social and spiritual aspects. The cycle of care giving will include pre-assessment, problem identification and prioritisation, setting objectives or targets, implementation of activities and outcome evaluation, including blended learning techniques through the use of digital technology.

SLFP reaches breaking point: Anura Yapa
Disaster Management Minister and SLFP Central Committee member Anura Priyadharshana Yapa yesterday said that the party had reached a breaking point after the the Joint Oppositions Paada Yatra to Colombo.
I admit that we have a problem of ideology within the party. We have to resolve it through discussion. We need to practise patience, Minister Yapa said. The minister was addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department.
The Paada Yatra which had the participation of several SLFP MPs earned the ire of senior members of the party, but Minister Yapa added that the SLFP Central Committee is yet to meet and decide on any disciplinary action that would be meted out to its errant members.
Answering to allegations that several participants of the Paada Yatra hooted at the SLFP headquarters while passing it, Minister Yapa said: We have never had members who hoot at the party headquarters. They are not members of our party,he said.
The minister said the Joint Opposition protest could not topple the government. They were determined to continue with the unity government until the next election. Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said:
The UNP did not feel the protest at all. The former President called the Prime Minister and asked for a place to hold their meeting.
The Prime Minister and the President were generous enough to give them Campbell Park, but they opted for Lipton Circus as their 2,000-3,000 people could fill that space.
We have seen university students protests which could muster more people than the Paada Yatra, he said.

Time to clean SLFP: UPFA, SLFP General Secretaries
UPFA and SLFP General Secretaries Mahinda Amaraweera and Duminda Dissanayake said the time has come to clean the SLFP to achieve glory again and create a united party.
They were addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
UPFA General Secretary Mahinbda Amaraweera said the leaders who organised the Paada Yatra could not bring as many people as they pledged and boasted.
They gave thousands of speeches earlier. But it ended with a few people. There were 10 to 15 thousand people instead of one million people, he said.
He said the Paada Yatra was an utter failure and criticised those who hooted at the SLFP headquarters while marching in the Paada Yatra.
This is something similar to one insulting ones own mother. This sort of behaviour can never be accepted. It was observed that drunk people were seen marching in the Paada Yatra uttering obscene language, he said.
Amaraweera said those who acted in an unruly manner at the Paada Yatra were SLFP parliament members linked to the Joint Opposition.
They said that the Paada Yatra was against the UNP, but it was revealed that the ulterior motive of it was to split the SLFP, he said.
He said moves are under way to strengthen the party. New organisers are appointed. Women are encouraged to join the SLFP.
Party General Secretary Dumina Dissnayake said the Joint Opposition (JO) is pushing the country to extremism and communalism by levelling baseless allegations.
He said Parliament cannot be dissolved until it completes over four years. It is useless to have this kind of protests against the government.
All 225 Parliamentarians have agreed with the process of formulating a new Constitution when the proposal was presented in Parliament, eventhough certain JO members claim that the new Constitution is a death trap.
Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said the utmost priority is given to strengthen the party.
He said even though those who organised the Paada Yatra said that they take the governing, there is no provision in the Constitution to take power when there is a government.
A committee has been appointed to organise the SLFPs 65th convention, which will be held on September, Perera said.

Paada Yatra aims at evading litigation: JHU
The prime objective of the Paada Yatra organised by the Joint Opposition was to make indirect influence on court cases that are being filed against former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, his family members and leading ministers of the previous regime, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) Central Committee member Ven. Hedigalle Vimalasara Thera said.
He made these observations at a press conference at the JHU headquarters in Battaramulla.
The Thera said the JHU would not give up its struggle against corruptions committed by the previous regime whatever the Paada Yatras come to Colombo.
The Thera said although the Joint Opposition boasted to bring one million people to Colombo, including 2,000 Buddhist priests, they failed.
He said although the Paada Yatra started by observing the five precepts, the precepts were broken one by one along the way to Colombo.
We could see how the liquor shops along the way were emptied. They used filthy language and said lies to mislead the people, he said.
The Thera said although Mahinda Rajapaksa speaks on protecting Buddhism, he has done nothing to do so while he was in office.
It was Mahinda Rajapaksa who prevented the Anti-conversion Bill moved against converting Buddhists to other religions, the Thera said.
When the Buddhist monks of the Malwatta Chapter instructed Mahinda Rajapaksa not to take revenge from Sarath Fonseka after his defeat at the Presidential Election, he said
he would form another chapter amalgamating Malwatta Chapter temples in the South, he said.
JHU Central Committee member Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said a government cannot be toppled by a Paada Yatra.
The Joint Oppositions objective was to create a political instability in the country to deviate foreign investment. Another objective was to divide the SLFP, he said.
Rajapaksas vision was not to allow the SLFP to come back to power if he cannot take over power. He said the Joint Oppositions attempt was also to prevent the people yielding the benefits of the national government set up uniting the two main political parties in the country.

The Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living has decided to permit import of maize to manufacture animal food as a remedial measure to prevent soaring production cost of chicken.
The decision was taken after discussions the Committee held under the patronage of Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake at the Finance Ministry yesterday. Stocks of maize hoarded by middlemen will be bought at Rs.52.50 per kilogram through Lak Sathosa.
They will be sold to fodder manufacturers at a concessionary price of Rs.45 per kilogram. The Finance Ministry will incur the loss of Rs.7.50 per kilogram caused due to providing maize at a lower rate.
The Agricultural Ministry was instructed to provide permits to animal food producers who have obtained recommendations from the Animal Food Production and Health Department to enable the fodder manufacturers to import 75,000 metric tons of maize.
The Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living instructed the authorities to import the permitted stocks of maize before the next season of maize harvesting.
Sri Lanka annually needs 400,000 metric tons of fodder. About 250,000 metric tons out of this is locally manufactured while the balance 150,000 metric tons should be imported. The first stock for this years requirement will be imported following the decision by the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living.
The Sub Committee on Cost of Living discussed the market situation after the maximum prices of essential consumer items were imposed recently. It was revealed that raids have been carried out to apprehend traders who violate government ruling and sell goods at higher prices. About 1,019 unscrupulous traders have been brought to book by the authorities.

Protest march showcases governments unpopularity: JO
The Joint Opposition yesterday said the Jana Satana Paada Yatra protest march from Kandy to Colombo showcased the governments unpopularity in a short period.
Mahindananda Aluthgamage MP told journalists in Colombo that the Paada Yatra was held against the government while overcoming many obstacles.
He said the march had attracted hundreds of thousands of people. The Lipton Circus and the Town Hall area were full of people on August 1, he said.
The MP said government leaders had worked to stop the march, but failed in the face of the peoples power.
He challenged the government and those who opposed the JO march to get at least half the crowd to Colombo which the Paada Yatra was able to attract on its final day.
He criticised the stand taken by the Police while adding that the law enforcement officers had tried to scuttle the march to please their political masters.
