GMOA will report Health Ministers conduct to Prime Minister
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will inform Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in writing about the conduct of the Health Minister aimed at undermining discussions in connection with SAITM, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Releasing a statement after a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA held a discussion with the coordinating group of the Prime Minister on the conduct of the Health Minister.
According to Dr. Aluthges statement, the Health Minister is trying to show that the SAITM issue is over with nationalising Dr. Nevilli Fernando Hospital. He is trying to legalise SAITM. He distorted the facts discussed, Aluthge said. The minister is also trying to form a trade union dividing the doctors community into sections. He tries to justify suppressing trade unionists and students unionists.
The GMOA hopes that the Prime Minister will not let the Health Minister sabotage discussions aimed at getting a permanent solution to the SAITM issue, he said.

Arrest of Britisher over Buddha tattoo: A case of supreme delays
Arguments concluded on June 10, 2015
Highlights chronic delays prevalent in courts islandwide
Daily News to file RTIs to find causes for delays in courts
Highlighting the issue of chronic delays and archaic procedure within the Justice system, the Fundamental Rights petition filed by Naomi Coleman, the Britisher who was arrested for adorning a Tattoo of The Buddha, was postponed close to a dozen times, after Judgment was reserved on June 10, 2015.
The case was re-fixed on July 4, 2017, for argument on October 26, 2017.
The case which drew international media attention was argued and concluded on June 10, 2015.
Written submissions were filed a month later. However, the presiding Judge who reserved Judgment in the case retired as a Judge of the Supreme Court without delivering Judgment.
It resulted in the continuous postponements of the case since. The Daily News learns that procedural issues such as this have resulted in litigants facing severe hardships throughout all Courts across the island including the Supreme Court of the country.
Following the retirement of the said Judge, the Petitioners filed a motion dated May 26, 2016 seeking direction from the Supreme Court on re-fixing the Petition for argument.
The motion was heard on July 7, 2016 before the then Chief Justice K. Sripavan who recorded that the  Judgment in this case could not be delivered due to the retirement. Thereafter the case was to be heard before two judges who heard the argument previously. However, the two judges have not sat on the same bench on dates the case was fixed for argument, resulting in continuous postponements. The final journal entry dated July 4 states again that the bench was not constituted and therefore be refixed for October 26, for Argument.
This is after the Registrar was consecutively directed to constitute a bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Depp and Justice Anil Goonaratne. The direction was given when the case was taken up prior to July 4, on on February 20, 2017. The same direction was also on November 8, 2016, September 15, 2016 and on the July 7, 2016.
The Petition was filed in May 2014, seeking a sum of compensation of 10 million Rupees citing the Police and other authorities as Respondents. Ms. Coleman was arrested on April 22, 2014 and detained at the Mirihana Detention Centre after which she was deported on April 25, 2014. The issue made international headlines. After considering the submissions made by both parties on July 3rd, 2014 the Judges of the Supreme Court granted leave to proceed for the infringement of Article 11, 12 (1) and 13 of the Constitution. The Daily News is in the process of filing requests under the Right to Information Act in order to ascertain the numbers and nature of case in which administrative and other issues have resulted in the chronic delays within the justice system of the country.

Asian Paints Lanka receives Green Mark Gold
Asian Paints Lanka has been awarded the Green Mark Gold certification by the Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB) in recognition of the eco-friendly characteristics ofApex UltimaProtek, the companys durable exterior emulsion paint.
The certification, in the Green Building Products category, is attributable to the products conformation to international Volatile Organic Compounds(VOC) criteria and the usage of only sustainable and eco-friendly raw materials in its manufacture. Exposure to increased levels of VOC is associated with respiratory problems and other health complications.
Moreover, Apex UltimaProtek contains no hazardous heavy metals such as lead, mercury, arsenic, chromium or cadmium and is also free of toxic materials that are carcinogenic or cause mutagenesis and reproductive toxicity.
Asian Paints (Lanka) Limited Director Jacob Kuruvilla said: We are delighted to be honoured with this certification. In Apex UltimaProtek, we have a product that is engineered for durability and protection of surfaces while being safe for its users and the environment, which is a great combination of attributes. It is a great finish for some of the landmark structures which will soon grace the skyline of Colombo.
Besides being safe and environmentally responsible, Apex UltimaProtek also comes with the assurance of a 10-year durability warranty, thereby eliminating the need to re-paint at frequent intervals.
Asian Paints attests to the products superior washability, effective waterproofing and corrosion preventive features like anti-carbonation that in turn lead to structural protection, and to its unique fibre reinforcement that aids in efficient crack bridging.
Catering to a wide cross section of consumer preference in aesthetics, Apex UltimaProtek is available in more than 1,000 shades as per the Asian Paints colour spectrum.
This is the second Green Mark Gold certification awarded by CIOB to Asian Paints in the last one year. In 2016, the company received the certification for Royale Matt interior emulsion paint.

The case had been proceeding for nearly 18 years. State Counsel Lahiru Jayamanna prosecuted. Attorney Upali Jayamanna appeared for the accused.

Ban on sili bags impractical: Dr. Predeep Perera
Since nearly 500,000 parcels of food are sold in Colombo city daily, the government should introduce an alternative before imposing a ban on shopping bags (sili) and polythene lunch sheets, Dr. Predeep Perera, President, People friendly (Janahithakami) Development Organisation said.
He added that the state and private sector employees migrating to the city for work daily, satiate their hunger by purchasing packeted meals sold in the city. As such, these workers, traders as well as food distributors would face many problems on account of this sudden ban on shopping bags and lunch sheets.
Although people had rushed to propose alternative wrappings, the suggestion to use items such as banana leaves and lotus leaves seemed impractical given the enormous quantities involved.
Even Saiver hotels had run short of banana leaves these days and as such, the government should reconsider its decision until a workable solution was found to the issue. He said bringing meals in receptacles would be more cumbersome for workers travelling long distances to reach their workplaces, instead of buying the meals in the city.

Bangladeshs first ever FTA to be signed with Sri Lanka
Bangladesh will sign its first-ever FTA with Sri Lanka, expecting to boost mutual trade this year.
It would be Dhakas first deal for free trade with any country, said Foreign Secretary Md Shahidul Haque.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and President Maithripala Sirisena decided to sign the deal in 2017 and asked that negotiations and studies be completed beforehand.
This is an amazing breakthrough because Bangladesh has never signed an FTA before. I believe this is a big political progress towards trade and investment between the countries, he said.
Earlier, Bangladesh signed 14 deals with Sri Lanka for cooperation in various fields following bilateral talks with a delegation headed by President Sirisena, who was in Dhaka for a three-day state visit.
Dhaka has been negotiating the FTA with Colombo since 2013 to increase trade now worth $80 million every year, said Secretary Haque.
The deal can overcome the tariff and non-tariff obstructions to mutual trade, he said. Bilateral trade relationships must be nurtured amid global changes in trade ties.
Youll notice how many nations have been emphasising on bilateral, trilateral or regional trade pacts. These act as supplements when the multilateral trade ties of a particular country fail to serve.
Bangladesh has been discussing FTAs with some other countries, and inking one with Colombo will raise its capacity to strike a good deal, he said. - BDnews24

Bates Sheron Jayasundara wins Top 50 Professional  & Career Women Gold Award for Advertising
Balancing a demanding job with child-rearing and running the home smoothly is the daunting task that most working women have to face. Sheron Jayasundara, the Chief Operating Officer of Bates Strategic Alliance has performed this task with such admirable skill that she became this years Gold Award winner in the Advertising Category at the Top 50 Professional & Career Womens Awards.
Bestowed by Women in Management in partnership with International Finance Corporation (IFC) - a member of the World Bank Group, the highly prestigious accolade is a fitting recognition of Sherons strength in managing both her professional career and personal life with equal aplomb.
Now in its seventh edition, the award recognizes women who inspire others, especially ambitious young people, with their success in both career and everyday life.
WIMs theme for 2017 is Beyond Parity  Developing Tomorrows Women Leaders and the award is an apt celebration of the winners ability to perform efficiently and effectively, seizing opportunities and overcoming challenges that come her way.
Tracing Sherons progression at Bates illustrates how she was able to face the challenges that crossed her path with a great deal of female intuition.
She joined Bates as an account manager in 1997 and is now running the companys flagship advertising operation as the Chief Operating Officer.
At the time I went into advertising in the early 1990s it was before the advent of computer creativity and I was lucky to have worked in all departments  from audiovisual productions, to media and client servicing, said Sheron.
None of this would have been a reality if not for my husband Sudath Jayasundara. It was Sudath who guided me to the field of advertising and also encouraged me to do my CIM (UK) exams. Today, I love my work because of the tremendous support and confidence placed on me by our Chairman, Nimal Gunewardena, who gives me the strength I need to overcome the daily challenges we face in the advertising industry. Im also proud to say that 50% of our professional staff at Bates are women, she said.
Sheron was elected President of Association of Accredited Advertising Agencies (Four As) and has been maintaining this position since 2015, adding considerable value to the advertising industry. There were several significant initiatives introduced after Sheron became President of 4As. We want to have more young people joining the industry. So we tied up with the Sri Lanka Press Institute to introduce a diploma course in corporate communications to attract people into advertising and PR, getting them to see the value of joining the industry, Sheron saidd.
As President, Sheron was also able to muster the support of the entire industry to implement the much needed professional pitch disbursement fee. We have many ideas to bring the professionalism, vibrancy and excitement back to the industry, said Sheron explaining her role and her aspirations as the head of 4As.

Biggest cinema gamble of 2017
It is crunch time for French filmmaker and EuropaCorp boss Luc Besson as he gears up for the July launch of his big-budget sci-fi extravaganza Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets.
The $180m picture - billed as the biggest budget European independent production of all time  comes out in 140 territories over a three-week period, kicking off in China on July 21, where it will be released on 9,000 screens.
Inspired by the graphic-novel series of French writer Pierre Christin and artist Jean-Claude Mzieres, the intergalactic saga follows the missions of space and time-travelling agent Valerian and his tough female colleague Laureline, played by rising stars Dane DeHaan and Cara Delevingne, with Rihanna also putting in a small appearance.
Even by Bessons own blockbuster standards, Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets is an audaciously ambitious production. Aside from the elevated budget, the series spans a complex universe and a multi-species cast of thousands of different extra-terrestrial beings.
The director freely admits that while its failure at the box office would not destroy EuropaCorp financially, as suggested in some media outlets, it would have a deep impact for him on a personal level. Screen Daily
Valerian And The City Of A Thousand Planets will begin screening at MC Colombo, Empire Arcade, Savoy Premire, City Cinema - Mt. Laviniya (4.15pm), Regal - Gampaha and other films halls from July 21. It is a CEL release

## Title: The birds and the bees are tales for boobies

The birds and the bees are tales for boobies
The phrase the birds and the bees is a metaphor for explaining the mechanics of reproduction to younger children. It relies on imagery of bees pollinating and eggs hatching to substitute for a more technical explanation of, well to be diplomatically explicit, explaining the propagation of the species.
In old fashioned times, which appears to be the era even at present, people were embarrassed to discuss the procreation process let alone tell children. So they used Mother Nature as a metaphor to portray it as a natural phenomenon and not a crime punishable by eternal damnation.
It is a way of deflecting the inevitable question that every parent dreads: "Where do babies come from" Besides, it is an alternative to the explanation that the stork delivers infants. Blaming their natural instincts and desires on the stork is the easiest way out of a tight predicament for parents. And it also exonerates them from confessing that they indulged in the process of hibbly-jibbly.
The connection between human sexuality and eggs and pollination is vague, which can cause some confusion among curious children who are mostly also, in my estimation, darned too precocious to boot. As a parent, we would do anything to protect our children. Indeed many of us, would wrap them up in bubble-wrap if we could. However unless you are a boo-bee  sorry booby  you will realise that awareness about sex however can occur a lot younger than we think. Children are becoming more aware of things on TV.
As our little progeny are growing up, we must recognise that we cant keep sheltering them from the big bad world. No, we simply cant keep cocooning them in cotton wool either. As hard as it is, both Momma and Poppa bird must let loose their fledglings out from under their protective wing and allow them to explore the real world.
And lets face it. We do need something warm and loving to tell kids at approximately seven years of age. The hard truth that children are the high price adults pay for having unprotected sex is just too much for them to process at that tender age.
The allegorical story of the birds and the bees has been handed down from generation to generation from time immemorial. I wonder whether it was the first parent to improvise an analogy of insects and feathered friends to soften the story of human sexuality. It must have been Adam in the Garden of Eden. I mean any guy who discarded his fig leaf must have known the consequences that would follow.
There are likely millions of versions of the birds and bees talk in every language known to man and they all serve one purpose  delaying the inevitable. My parents were no exception to the norm. They always told me: "I'll tell you when you're older". They never did. But being a precocious brat I could never figure out why birds would be mating with bees. Well, nobody told me a thing, but I did grow up in 1950s Sri Lanka. Parental wisdom then and now was that the less you knew about sex, the longer childhood could be preserved. Besides I used to follow the buzzing bees around our herbaceous gardens and observed that the Gentleman Bee followed the Queen of his heart all the time and was not interested in chasing birds or Ladybugs of indeterminate gender to make babies. Turns out, at least for honeybees, sex is an acrobatic, open-air event. Once mating is complete, the drone falls to the ground and dies in minutes to hours. My friend Surchepps regaled us with a tale of how he fielded the tricky question from his seven-year-old son, pet-named Pancho. He answered the loaded query with brilliant yet ambiguously witty honesty. Well it goes like this, if a bird and a bee love each other very much. The bee likes to sting the bird with his stinger! But the gifted little bounder had obviously been taking an assiduous interest in his biology class was not easily fobbed off with his old boys explanation. Pancho: But I thought the bees lose their lives when they sting. Surchepps: Oh they do son, they do. Thats why bees should remember to use protection!
As much as we like to think we are our childrens best teachers, its the time they spend with friends that provide them with the most education in this unmentionable sphere.
Some time ago my spinster aunt Rhonda was reading to my niece and nephew in the garden. As the three of them were enjoying the outdoors little Lynette pointing to a tree says: Oh look at those two birds over there, Aunty Rhonda. They were clearly mating. Smart woman that she is, Rhonda said nothing. Gripping the book she was reading a little tighter, she was about to point out that the birds were in fact warblers and that they were fighting. Friendly fighting, that is.
But before she could break the awkward silence, Lynette did. And the one on the top, said the eight-year-old, is giving the one on the bottom CPR.
Apparently at her grade school, life-saving skills are taught before sex education. She heard her nephew Michael repeat in a high, sceptical voice: CPR
Yes, said Lynette, CPR is an emergency procedure for a person whose heart has stopped or is no longer breathing. Thats why hes just peck, peck, pecking away. Attempting to steer the discussion away from the two flapping birds, Rhonda asked Michael when his next martial arts class was. He didnt answer. We think he was too busy trying to figure out how warblers learned CPR. And for the record, thats what Colombo kids in our family call it  CPR!.
Another case in point when a former neighbours eight-year-old elder son named Bunty, spent time at an outdoor camping stint where the counsellors teach them swimming, climbing and survival methods. Their charges learn to survive their own rowdy games such as scratching, punching and singing bawdy songs. Back at home Bunty initiates his five-year-old kid brother Guy in to the rude songs. Not satisfied with his efforts he inveigles his sibling into playing a naughty word play game.
Hey, Guy, he whispers to him with a sly smile, say X really fast, over and over. Guy, pleased to be enlisted in his brothers game, says: X X X X X X X. Bunty giggles uncontrollably. You said, Sex sex sex sex sex sex sex!

Case against Dhammaloka Thera; Complainants express willingness to settle

The party which filed a private complaint against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance today informed Court they are ready for a settlement if Dhammaloka Thera takes measures to minimize public nuisance.
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe, the complainant expressed willingness to settle the matter. Accordingly, the case was fixed for August 22 and the parties were directed to inform their stance regarding a possible settlement on that date.
At a previous occasion, the Court decided to overrule preliminary objections raised by Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda over a private plaint filed against him for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance.
On December 6, 2016, the Court had issued a conditional order preventing Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka from using loudspeakers in a manner causing nuisance at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda between 5.00 a.m. and 6.00 a.m.
The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the Section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr.Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Hallok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple.
They said the authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.
Senior Counsel Ravindranath Dabare with Counsel Sugath Attapattu appeared for the Centre for Environmental Justice.

Moving towards an export oriented economy
Lionel Wijesiris recent article titled Moving towards an export-oriented economy published on July 13 is beautifully written with facts. As a lecturer with interest in global economics, I wish to add three more points to supplement his article.
First, the global economic environment is constantly changing and the conditions that made export-oriented growth a success story in previous decades need to be modified to fit into today's atmosphere when drafting an export-oriented strategy.
Second, the growing importance of successful export-oriented economies provides not only an example to be followed but, at the same time, it narrows the manoeuvring room of late comers and exerts a certain crowding-out effect. Third, even if there are a lot of convincing arguments, any change from one economic strategy to another one is not a question of desire and aspiration, but fundamentally depending on the availability of the necessary resources and instruments at home and of a favourable international environment that could support successful reorientation towards an export-led growth pattern.
We need to take extra precaution considering these points also, when we move in to the implementation of an export oriented economy in Sri Lanka.

CSE to open dollar  trading by year end
The much awaited Dollar Trading Board of the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) would be up and running by the end of the year, said CSE Chairman, Ray Abeywardena last Friday, at the Ramada Hotel Colombo. This would allow foreigners to trade in dollars.
He said that this would open up opportunities for regional companies to trade in CSE and later it would be open to Sri Lanka companies as well. Regional countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan too could benefit from this.
Abeywardena said Gulf based mobile company Orridu now operating in the Maldives has come on board to be the first company on this Board. He said that the Board would help Sri Lanka to be positional as a major financial hub similar to Hong Kong or Switzerland.
The CSE Chairman said most of the CSE indicators are improving but it was not enough. If you take communist ruled Vietnam the daily turnover is in the excess of US$ 88 million and in Bangladesh its around US $ 100 million as against the daily turnover of around 6 million a day in CSE. This is 23% of the GDP which is a 6% drop from a few years ago.
However the daily turnover has increased from last month from 700 million to 900 million. Today foreign inflows have been very strong and have increased to US$ 28 billion. He recalled that 2012 was the record year where the turn over touched 38 billion per year. The market capitalization which was 2.7 trillion has gone up to 3 trillion today and we need to further increase it.
Last week the Colombo Stock Exchange recorded the second highest net foreign inflow of Rs 22.8 billion in a given year. Abeywardena said that things were moving positively and they have also got approval for the Delivery VS Payment System (DVP) by mid next year.
CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranayake said that they are looking at more ways to woo additional companies to trade in the SEC. We will be talking to some of the large family owned businesses in this regard.
He also said they are also talking once again with the government to explore the possibility of some of the State Owned enterprises to be listed. Plans are also under way to host an investment conference in Colombo next March and a Road show in New York end of the year, he said.

Deprived for a cause of strikes and students

A few weeks ago, 23-year-old Shafeer Ahamed, a Jaffna University medical student celebrated his first year since the boycott of lectures at the faculty began. His union had warned him and other students not to attend lectures until the government made a decision on the status of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
To commemorate the event, a reluctantly defiant Ahamed took to Facebook.
I entered University in January 2015 on my first attempt. After our second year final exams, we got vacation and just two weeks into our lectures thereafter, we were asked to boycott them. All academic activities have been stopped since then, said Ahamed.
I am involved in social service activities at home in Kathankudy and at times I also teach science, biology and chemistry to O/L students in the area.
It has been over a year since I returned home and I was starting to get sick of it. So my friends and I decided that we would go back to our hostel at the University. Now, we just sit around here playing games and watching movies, he added.
As an acceptable solution to the issue has been slow in coming, Ahamed said his initial resolve to continue with the strike no matter what, has started to wane. Now I think that we should continue our strike but not let our studies be affected. It would be great if we can do both in parallel, he said.
Ahamed is not alone in his struggle. According to the University Grants Commission (UGC), the 2015 intake for Medicine was at 6,226 students for all state universities. Today they all remain at home, adamant that they will only go back to University, once SAITM is abolished or taken over by the government.
Waiting to be called
Whilst Ahamed struggles to progress with his studies, 21-year-old Mahinda Senarath has not even started his. Having been chosen for Medicine at the Rajarata University this year, the UGC is yet to inform him of when he would need to report for his first lecture.
I have been trying to get into medicine for the last two years. The seniors are on strike, so for the last seven months, we are at home, not knowing when we will get in, he said.
In the meantime, he has taken to working as an intern in a private company. His seniors at the Rajarata Medical Faculty union however have already made contact with him and all those in his district of Matale through social media and whatsapp groups. They keep him up to date and aware of why he needs to oppose SAITM and constantly pressure him to join protests.
They call for picketing but I have not been able to go because I am working, said Senarath, but stressed that it was important that all keep the struggle going.
I am not sure when this will end, it has been seven months and we have had no news. I have no faith that this would be resolved soon. If they decide to go back to lectures next year at least, I will be 22 when I enter University and by the time I complete the degree, I will be 27, he added.
In a country like ours, you cannot expect the private sector to maintain standards and for the regulators to do their job. So it is better that the government takes it over, said Senarath echoing the stance followed by his union.
Shyamali Perera who is in a similar position as Senarath however, has started to run out of patience though she is quick to add that she understands that the struggle is for the benefit of all.
No matter what the solution is, I hope it is given quickly. And every year it is going to affect more and more students. We cannot go for lectures until the batch before us completes theirs, so I can only think that it will be worse for those who come after us, she said.
Keeping the fight going
SAITM which began in 2008 has been an issue of contention for state university students from the start. It not only goes against their belief of not privatising education but its questionable standards have fuelled the fire of union protests and it helps their leaders justify their cause to new recruits.
Sapumal Bandara (23) is technically in his third year of study at the Rajarata University Medical Faculty. The boycott of lectures at his faculty started when he had one and a half months of lectures to complete in his second year and was poised to sit for the end of year exams. If not for the boycott, he would be completing almost seven months into his third year. At present however, he occupies his time with campaign work for the Inter University Student Federation (IUSF) where he is an active member.
All seven Medical Faculties in the country have now decided that we need to support this boycott. At present we are heavily involved in campaign work. Earlier it was faculty based, but now we are doing it district wise and we are joining together with other trade unions to widen our reach. We dont have Faculties everywhere, but every district has students, so we are targeting them. If you take Matale, we bring together all students in the Matale district and use them to organize and launch our campaign, said a highly motivated Bandara, who hails from Aluvihare, Matale and received his education at Dharmaraja College, Kandy.
One for all, all for one
As the campaign wears on however, it has become paramount that the unions keep the students who are in the struggle motivated and in line with the cause.
I am fully committed to this. We cannot think of problems as separate individuals. This is all part of our collective responsibility. These things do affect us greatly in a personal sense; the girls suffer more because the older they get, the later every other decision in their life, like marriage, is going to get. But, the girls too have not been hesitant to join us because they have a good understanding of the problem, said Bandara.
He added that the more committed all of them were to the cause, the sooner they would see results.
The government does not have money for education because of corruption. The people work 365 days a year to pay taxes to the government and bring in revenue and if there is a problem in our government revenue, it is only the government to blame. Whether you take the Uma Oya problem or Meethotamulla, the government makes a mistake and then they have to pay compensation, but that too from our tax money. Education is a right and no matter whether you have money or not, you must have access to it, explained Bandara further.
Where does the information come from
The IUSFs arguments on equality are not hard to follow and for 24-year-old Hana Thowfeek, they have given her new found purpose.
I entered university after my third attempt. I always wanted to become a doctor. Protests against SAITM were being carried out even before I entered university. On the very first day itself we were advised to participate in the protests and it was compulsory, she explained.
I do participate in the protests and I believe in what the 'union aiyas tell us, she stressed.
Thowfeek along with others in her batch attend continuous workshops to educate them on the state of private education in Sri Lanka and SAITM.
Once we were taken to Anuradhapura to stage protests, we were there for three days. They even provided us with accommodation. We had several awareness programmes and it was very useful for the students. We will not turn back until the government takes a proper decision on SAITM, said a defiant Thowfeek.
While she was disappointed that it would take her an additional two years to complete her medical degree, Thowfeek said she was not worried about it too much. We are fighting to protect the standard of education in Sri Lanka, she added as she echoed Bandaras statements.
Thowfeeks main source of information on education and SAITM come from the union and she is not alone, as Senarath, Perera, Ahamed and Bandara too echo the same union rhetoric. And neither have anyone questioned or challenged the arguments of the ayyas.
Followers
Dr. Madushanka Halpewattage currently practices at the Mankulam Hospital and is part of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and explained that everyone automatically joins the union at university.
The union handles all student welfare and everything has to go through the union welfare committee, so everyone is part of it. We only have one union and union heads are elected by your batch mates; all are friends, said Dr. Halpewattage who was also a batch leader in his time at the University of Kelaniya.
The struggle against SAITM began when he was in his second year. Our seniors discussed the issue, and they made us aware of it. Thereafter we discussed it as a batch and the decisions made by all were similar; we all were against SAITM, he said; an active demonstrator against SAITM at the time.
I feel that we could have stopped things then. I feel ashamed that we didnt fight hard enough at the time to stop this, so the kids now wouldnt have to go through this, said Dr. Halpewattage.
Fighting to the end
Having been extensively involved in the struggle against SAITM, Bandara believed that they would soon see some positive results.
In the late 80s, the students boycotted lectures for three years before the North Colombo Medical College was closed down but the situation today is different. Then they only had state media to mould opinion, but today we have several private media which support us and we also have social media- the government cannot supress information or students like they did before. So I believe that a solution will come soon, it wont drag on for years, he said.
He further explained that they were working according to a plan and that they have noticed several favourable changes in the recent past.
The Specialist Doctors Union, all Deans, Professors, GMOA, Medical Students, Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Front line Socialist Party (FSP), Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), the Joint Opposition, JHU, some in the UNP and SLFP are with us. The President has also agreed that SAITM should be taken over by the government. Those who are against us are just Minister Rajitha Senaratne and a few others."
"A year ago, this was not the situation. At that time, we went on a foot march from Colombo to Kandy for five days, it was a tough journey but we didnt get much media exposure for that. But today, no television programme or news programme is carried out without the mention of SAITM- this is because of our poster campaigns, protests and awareness programmes. We have created this level of awareness. In future too we have a plan on how to proceed and so we believe that in the near future they will have to make a decision on this, said a confident Bandara.
Genuine concerns
Amidst the chaos and noise however, the struggle for SAITM has brought out some genuine fears within the medical student community.
Ahamed pointed out that there was a dearth of doctors in government hospitals due to a delay in providing medical students with clinical training.
There are more than 5,000 medical students who have passed the EPRM exams who are still waiting to get clinical training. The government needs to increase the number of teaching hospitals. Even we have to wait for nearly a year for an internship after our final exam. All these need to be considered by the government to solve the issues regarding medical education in Sri Lanka, he said.
Bandara in the meantime, is worried that if they let more private medical universities come in, all their professors would leave state universities for higher paying jobs in the private sector.
SAITM already has got 21 of the best professors from state universities teaching there; two from Rajarata are there. We cannot stop them going because private universities will always pay more and they can get their kids into those, so they can have good professors there, he said.
In addition, he pointed out that SAITM had started its operations with dubious means and the recent episode where its CEO staged a shooting was proof that it was a crooked entity.
More importantly, the students are adamant that they need to stop SAITM as they believe it is a harbinger of worse things to come.
For the government, SAITM is its pilot project in its plan to privatise education. After SAITM, they say five more private medical universities want to come to Sri Lanka, Minister Lakshman Kiriella has said that in Parliament. Then they say SLMC has got 15 applications for private medical universities and if they sell the medical degree, all will be sold, said Bandara.
Dr. Halpewattage in the meantime, saw the shutting down of SAITM as a means to protect the medical profession, We cannot allow students who have not been trained properly or given proper clinical practice. Their medical faculty is not registered with the SLMC, standards cannot be adopted, and it has been crooked from the start. We have to stop this to protect our profession, we love our profession, we dont want low quality doctors, he said.
A higher cause
The students, all in their early 20s ultimately have also found the glamour in fighting for a cause to be irresistible.
Some people do point fingers at us and say since we receive free education, its with their money that we study to become doctors. They further say that we are wasting their money by delaying academic activities. The truth however, is that the people who blame us are not bothered about the billions of money that are being stolen by politicians. We are at least fighting for a good cause, for the betterment of our own country but what are those politicians doing questioned Thowfeek when asked why she continued with the protests.
Bandara in the meantime, said he could not go back to lectures, knowing that the problem had not been resolved. The worst we can do is take advantage of the free education we have been given and not give our best for the fight. If we dont fight, free education is at risk.
I will be going against my conscience if I were to go for lectures without being successful in this.
Bandara also believed that all private education institutions should be shut down and that the government allocate six percent of GDP to education as a start to solve all problems. He hoped that those who engage in private education too will see how the government has been short-changing them of their own right to free education.
At university, you think no private education at all and that was the best stance to take then. It is not that my ideas have changed since then, that was suited back then but now I think we can have standardized private medical education, but SAITM is not the best example of private medical education."
"For this, we need a national policy with the consultation of the eight state medical faculties, KDU, lecturers, GMOA and other trade unions, SLMC, UGC, health and higher education ministries, said Dr. Halpewattage who insisted that neither the doctors nor the students will stand down until the gates of SAITM close once and for all.

Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital  formally handed over to govt.
The handing over ceremony of the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital to the government was held yesterday under the auspices of President Maithripala Sirisena.
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed before President Sirisena between the government, represented by Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Janaka Sugathadasa, and founder of the hospital, Dr. Neville Fernando, at the hospital premises.
Under the agreement, Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital will be administered independently by a board of directors and function as a government teaching hospital from August 1, 2017.
Speaking at the event, Minister of Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senaratne pointed out that it was the first time in the countrys history that a private owner has willingly agreed to vest his property in the government. Dr. Fernando has willingly agreed to hand over the hospital without any resistance, the Minister said, adding that such a large local investment benefitting the state sector should be commended. He also declared that all profession-related issues regarding the Hospital and SAITM have now been resolved, while only the politically motivated issues of various parties remain.
The Minister expressed his gratitude to Dr. Neville Fernando for donating the hospital to the state despite having worked tirelessly to establish the private hospital while also agreeing to broaden the ownership and administration of the institution. According to the Minister, the handover would not have been possible if not for the efforts of President Sirisena, who held discussions with all parties involved in order to eliminate any resistance to the matter.
Dr.Senaratne also ensured that all the current staff of the hospital will be retained.
Meanwhile, Dr. Fernando at the event said that he considers his decision to hand over the hospital to the government as a meritorious act. Such acts are not alien to my family and I have no regrets or sadness regarding the move, he said.

Federer wins record 8th Wimbledon as Cilic bid ends in tears
London: Roger Federer won a record eighth Wimbledon title and became the tournaments oldest champion Sunday with a straight-sets victory over injury-hit Marin Cilic who dramatically broke down in tears midway through the final.
Federer claimed his 19th Grand Slam title 6-3, 6-1, 6-4 and at 35 is Wimbledons oldest mens winner of the modern era, succeeding Arthur Ashe, who was almost 32 when he won in 1976.
However, the Swiss superstars 11th Wimbledon final, and 29th at the majors, will also be remembered for the moving sight of the popular Cilic breaking down in tears after slipping 3-0 behind in the second set. The seventh seeded Croatian, the 2014 US Open champion, sobbed inconsolably and buried his head in his towel as his title dream slipped away.
He had his left foot taped at the end of the second set but it was in vain as Federer became the first player since Bjorn Borg in 1976 to win Wimbledon without dropping a set in the entire tournament.
Hes a hero, Federer said of his opponent.
Twelve months ago, Federer was defeated in five sets in the semi-finals by Milos Raonic and promptly shut down his season to rest a knee injury.
Its disbelief I can achieve such heights. I wasnt sure I would ever be here in another final after last year, said Federer, who turns 36 in three weeks time and who has now broken the tie for seven Wimbledon titles he shared with Pete Sampras and William Renshaw.
I had some tough ones in the finals, losing two against Novak Djokovic.
But I always believed. I kept on believing and dreaming I could get back.
Here am I today with the eighth. Its fantastic, if you keep believing you can go far in your life.
Federer won his 18th Slam in Australia in January on his return to the tour before adding the Indian Wells and Miami Masters back-to-back and a ninth Halle grasscourt title.
He also skipped the entire claycourt season.
Ive got to take more time off, joked Federer, playing in just his seventh event of the year.
Ill be gone again for the next six months! I dont know if it will work as well again.
Cilic, who had spent four and a half hours more than Federer getting to the final, said retiring with his injury was never an option.
I never give up in a match. I gave it my best -- its all I can do, said Cilic who was still emotional at the trophy presentation.
I had an amazing journey here. I played the best tennis of my life. I really want to thank my team -- they gave so much strength to me.
Beneath a star-studded Royal Box where Prince William and wife Kate rubbed shoulders with actors Hugh Grant and Bradley Cooper, Cilic had his first break point in the fourth game. It was saved by Federer and it was to be Cilics only glimmer of hope. Federer broke in the next game when his opponent suffered a nasty fall on the worn surface which was to ultimately undermine his challenge.
Federer then served up two love service games before claiming the opener 6-3 off a Cilic double fault, the Croatians second of the final.
The Swiss superstar swept into a 3-0 lead in the second set and at the changeover, Cilic slumped in his courtside chair in tears and in obvious pain. The trainer and doctor were summoned before Cilic hid his head in his towel in a desperate attempt to compose himself.
The 28-year-old held serve on the resumption but the lethal barrage continued, Federer stretching his lead over his friend to 4-1.
Cilic dropped the set 6-1 and called a medical timeout to have his left foot bandaged and take a painkiller.
His discomfort was reflected in his statistics.
By the end of the second set, he had served just two aces compared to the 130 he had fired past bamboozled opponents in his previous six rounds. Federer pounced again with a break for 4-3 and wrapped up the one-sided final with a second serve ace to complete his coronation after just 1hr 41 minutes.
Fittingly, he too wept at the end.

Fredericks suspended over disgraced Diack payment
Paris: Former world champion sprinter Frankie Fredericks has been provisionally suspended from his role in athletics pending an ethics investigation, the IAAF said Monday.
Fredericks was suspended from his role as member of the IAAFs ruling council amid a probe by the IAAFs integrity unit led by former English Court of Appeal judge Sir Anthony Hooper, the IAAF said.
Fredericks stood down himself from his role as head of the IOCs evaluation commission for the 2024 Olympics, but the IAAF said it felt it had no choice but to officially suspend him too.
The order for provisional suspension does not prejudge the outcome of the investigation which the athletics integrity unit is carrying out, the IAAF said.
In March the French daily Le Monde said the former sprinter received $299,300 dollars (262,000 euros) from Papa Massata Diack, son of ex-IAAF president Lamine Diack, on October 2, 2009, the day Rio de Janeiro was awarded the right to host th 2016 Olympics.
The widely popular Fredericks insists that the payments were for promoting athletics events and the IAAF said Monday the suspension was not a presumption of guilt.
Fredericks says the payment had to do with a contract that had been signed in March 2007 for promotion services between 2007 and 2011. AFP

## Title: GLOBAL EMPIRES OF ADVICE

## Date: Tuesday, July 18, 2017 - 01:00
GLOBAL EMPIRES OF ADVICE
For those interested in strategy and the process of decision making, the Battle of Pharsalus offers an excellent case study with lessons that are valid even today.
In 48 BC the forces of the Roman Senate commanded by Pompey the Great, a renowned soldier and statesmen, often compared to Alexander, were defeated by those of his ambitious rival, Julius Caesar. The outcome of the battle was surprising because Pompey had both the numerical advantage with 12 legions or 45,000 troops as well as enjoying vast superiority in terms of supplies, against Caesar's smaller force of 22,000 legionaries.
Confident of his advantageous position, Pompey wanted to delay the battle knowing that Caesar's army albeit smaller was more battle hardened. He based this on the knowledge that his rival's force, faced with shortages in food and other supplies was likely to implode as a result of starvation and mutinies if he were to adopt a long term strategy of attrition. Since all armies, including Roman legions, ultimately march in their stomachs, to quote a much later strategist, Napoleon Bonaparte, this was a sound course of action to follow.
In that context, it was rather unexpected that Pompey would opt to engage Caesar at Pharsalus, in Greece, and would be soundly defeated in that battle by his rival. What is certain is that Pompey threw away his advantage and gave Caesar the battle the latter so badly needed and indeed wanted. The defeat of the senatorial faction would have far reaching strategic and political consequences, paving the way for Caesar's dictatorship, his subsequent assassination and the establishment of nearly five centuries of rule by the autocratic Roman Empire.
Advice on military strategy
Chroniclers of the Appian Wars including Cicero, Plutarch and the great poet Lucan, attribute Pompey's fateful decision to his heeding the misguided advice from a cohort of personalities, generally, senators, collectively described as the Iactators.
The Iactators, which is translated from the Latin as charlatans and sometimes as boasters, were determined to make their mark on history by giving their five sestertii worth of advice on military strategy of which they were woefully ignorant. The result was Pompey's disastrous defeat at the hands of Caesar at Pharsalus in 48 BC.
The importance of making decisions, and more importantly the right ones, is a daunting issue that transcends both time and geography. The cost of making a wrong decision remains a worrisome possibility for anyone entrusted with a position of responsibility. Hence all organisations have a paramount need to be equipped with proper mechanisms to be able to formulate the right types of policies that will ensure that the right decisions are taken at all times.
In many ways, there have not been fundamental changes since Roman times given that decision making is still largely dependent on advice. But the fundamental difference is that today, advice has become a multinational industry, which goes under the name of Consultancy.
In the current context, we are no longer faced with the dangerous prospect of a coterie of Roman senators who had never thrown a pilum at a foe, advising on how legions are to be best deployed. What we have today in Consultancy is a US$ 250 billion dollar industry (2016) that grows annually at 4.1%. This Consultancy industry often uses brilliant minds and the most advanced statistical tools to build scientific foundations to their advisory service.
The largest section of this industry is operational advice (about 30%) followed by financial advice (28%) and strategy (15%).
All these three main sectors are vital for a developing country such as Sri Lanka, which is recovering from 30 years of conflict and a legacy of not having taken in many cases the right type of decision. It also must be added that Sri Lanka needs to take stock of the advances and rapid changes that have arisen from globalisation, to develop Laws and legislation in line with those of the modern world and also to assimilate cutting edge technologies already adopted by nations that are world leaders.
In the Consultancy business, Asia is one of the main recipients of such expertise and It is already estimated that 16% of all the consulting business, to the value of US$ 40 billion was purchased by Nations in the Asia Pacific Region.
Sri Lankan context
Sri Lanka will, therefore, need to be prepared for an influx of consultants given the need to improve in many important areas. A major issue is to ascertain whether the country is well prepared to assimilate the advice given and make the best of this. However, the true nature of this advice needs to be studied thoroughly given that it may or may not be applicable to the Sri Lankan context. Knowledge can bring about positive changes and build capacity if its best practices can be adopted.
A criticism of the consultancy business is that more often than not the client provides the information to the consultant who then builds a model around it. Hence often the recipient of the advice is under the impression that it is he or she who did all the work. This idea that consultant picks the brains of their clients is often mentioned in publications dealing with the subject of consultancy.
Another area that is of interest is the professionalisation of advice with leading consulting firms have become de facto Global Empires of Advice. Among the most prestigious consulting firms ranked every year for include many famous names such McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, Bain and Company leading. The others are Booz, Allen Hamilton, PricewaterhouseCooper, KPMG LLG, to name just a few.
Other bodies that provide advice are international organisations such as the World Bank, and the various specialised agencies of the United Nations. Of course, many of these consultancy firms and bodies have ideas on certain aspects of policy which may or may not be in accordance with the best interest of the host country.
As a profession that earns a living disbursing advice, rather than creating wealth through industry or agriculture, Consultants have often been at the receiving end of many jokes and sarcasm.
Well known Canadian journalist Carl Honore decried the infatuation for easy answers to complex issues stating We live in a culture that's been hijacked by the Management Consultant. We want everything boiled down to a power point slide. We want metrics and show me the numbers. That runs counter to the complex nature of so many social, economic and political problems. You cannot devise an algorithm to fix them.
The great economist and Nobel prize laureate Paul Samuelson is even less charitable when describing the performance of the consulting profession often when I become a consultant to a federal agency, that precipitates its demise.
Others are even more merciless, questioning the very nature of consultants. Mo Ibrahim said What do you do if you are an executive who resigns You declare yourself a consultant.
Global markets
Leading Insurance magnate Eric Severeid introduces humour to the discussion, defining a Consultant: any ordinary guy more than fifty miles from home.
But some cases where consulting advice has gone wrong are hardly laughing matters. An often quoted case was the advice dispersed by consultants working for a leading world body to Governments of developing nations to encourage their small scale farmers to give up subsistence farming to boost their earnings by cultivating cash crops instead.
The rationale behind this advice was that cash crops would lift the farmers out of poverty by connecting them to global markets. Whilst there were some indeed some success stories, many of these farmers were unable to secure markets in developed countries. At the same time since some of these crops such as coffee were governed by commodity markets, a reduction in their value could inevitably result in the impoverishment of the said farmers. Hence the cost of changing their production from subsistence to cash crops often worsened the situation, with farmers not even having the option of eating their produce. At a national level situations have arisen where those developing countries food security was seriously compromised.
Very recently there has been interest on the part of consulting bodies to promote the privatisation of healthcare and they have been providing advice to countries both developed and developing, to move away from a system of healthcare funded by taxation.
There is however little evidence to support the idea that privatised healthcare is more efficient than a national health system and a private system is probably not as well equipped for dealing with contingencies such as epidemics or pandemics. Another daunting issue is the extent to which the advice that the consultants provide can address the real problems. The philosopher Matthew Stewart, author of the celebrated works The Management Myth wrote that Whoever pays a consultant gets pretty much what they want to hear.
Hence the question of what advice is needed and indeed beneficial remains largely unanswered even though the implications of heeding the wrong advice can steer a country on the wrong path and the cost may be very high to bear and the necessity of developing the right tools for analysis is therefore of a paramount importance.

God-given
When I met Angeline Goonetilleke for the first time, I immediately felt her warmth and kindness. Of course now she is frail, suffering from a partial paralysis. We did not speak for a long time, yet throughout the interview she impressed me with her faith and I understood why she is loved by so many people. In addition to having been bestowed with the gift of singing she is a lovely person. Last May Angeline suffered a stroke and a blood clot hit the right side of her brain.
First of all I must thank the Lord my God and Jesus and the Holy Spirit, because they saved my life. I feel that day god was with me with two guardian angels. So I must thank God saving my life, said Angeline.
It was then that Angeline sang a hymn for me.
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works Thy hands have made;
I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
Then sings my soul, my Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
Then sings my soul, My Savior God, to Thee,
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!
When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,Still I cannot sing because, after my physiotherapy, my voice went out because I was screaming and shouting in pain. My doctor has asked me not to talk much because I am a singer. It will take a little time for me to sing again. But I must thank the god who saved me. I must also thank Jesus and the Holy Spirit, stated Angeline.
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
Then shall I bow, in humble adoration,
And then proclaim, My God, how great Thou art!
Angeline was highly regarded by anyone who had the fortune of listening to her angelic voice.
I was in the Lama Pitiya, a childrens Sinhala radio program co-hosted by the legendary Karunaratne Abeysekera, where I sang live. All children under the age of 13 sang. I was then Angeline De Lanerolle. My name was very popular then. Then I married Leslie Goonetilleke, but the popularity remained the same. When I took part in Lama Pitiya, from that first day onwards I became very popular. When you become 14 you have to leave Lama Pitiya, said Angeline.
I asked her to what she attributes her success to and Angeline was resolute that she attributes her success to God.
My everything is God. The person I am now is due to God. Everything is God. I wont go beyond God. I listen to God and I fear god. I love God, pointed out Angeline.
When I asked Angeline what the important milestones were in her career she was quick to say that it is God.
Everything I must thank God. God is my milestone. My popularity and everything is due to God. He is my milestone. There is no other person, I love God very much, said Angeline
At this point in the interview Angeline was overwhelmed with emotion and said that god has given her a voice and that she loves God very much. She said that she is now unafraid and knows that she will get her voice back. I trust God and my trust is in God.
Angeline is the seventh in a family of 10.
I must thank God first of all and then my doctors- Prof. Ravindra Satharasinghe and the nurses who were with me in the hospital. So I must thank everybody. I cant do anything these day. Even cooking I have stopped. I have also gone down. I used to cook nice curries. However I am very positive about the future. God is the one who can do everything in his own time. He has a date and time to cure me. I will wait until that day and time comes, explained Angeline.
Mostly Angeline has sung in films. She was a film play back singer.
I am proud to say that I am a film playback singer. When I am completely healed I will re-enter the field and that will be very soon. I am very proud of that. I cannot fully raise my left hand. I am undergoing Sinhala Native Treatment which is the best treatment. There is a young lady doctor visiting me. She is treating me. She is Doctor Amali Perera, added Angeline.
Recently she has gone to around three weddings which show that she is recovering.
You must have hope and faith in God. I also want to thank Father Angelo and Father Sam. I also want to thank Father Anton Dinesh. They all came to see me at the hospital and gave me communion and everything. Bishop Silva came home to see me. Sujatha Aththanayake and Latha Walpola came to see me in addition to many other artistes.

Golden Key Hospital acquires Zeiss AngioPlex OCT Angiography capability
The Golden Key Hospital has taken a major step forward in retinal disease management with the acquisition of new equipment that enhances the capability of its Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) facilities.
The Hospital said it has upgraded its CIRRUS 5000 HD-OCT machine with Zeiss AngioPlex OCT Angiography, enabling doctors to view both vascular and structural information from a single non-invasive scan.
As a result, they are able to acquire ultra-clear, colour-depth-resolved 3D microvascular imaging of the retina via dye-free angiography as part of routine eye care, making retinal disease management and treatment planning more efficient and effective.
Angioplex technology revolutionises clinical practice with single-scan simplicity, and ensures artefact-free scans and precise location identification during follow-up visits, a spokesman for the Golden Key Hospital said. It also eliminates concerns about potential allergic reactions to the dyes used in standard angiography.
The technology also enables doctors to quantify microvascular change in patients by comparing changes from visit to visit to identify patients progressing in disease.
The acquisition of this latest technology reflects the Hospitals continuing commitment to offering patients the benefit of the best medical equipment available and standards that match those of renowned international medical institutions, he said.
The Golden Key Hospital is the only private sector hospital in Sri Lanka that is a centre of excellence dedicated and equipped for all Eye & ENT related investigations, treatment and surgery. This state-of-the-art super specialty hospital is backed by a team of experts and nursing staff with specialised training in Eye and ENT. The hospital is equipped for 3D Optical Coherence Tomography and treatment of all eye diseases. Tests such as Fundus Fluorescein Angiography (FFA), Fundus Photography, A&B scans, Visual field assessment, Pachymetry Binocular Single Vision test, computerised eye tests for spectacles, as well as laser treatment and phacoemulsification surgery for cataracts are done routinely at the hospital. The hospital also offers vitreoretinal surgery for problems such as retinal detachment, diabetic eye diseases and intraocular infection.
The hospital is managed by an Advisory Committee comprising of Professor Rohan W. Jayasekara, Emeritus Professor and former Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo (Chairman), Dr. Saliya Pathirana, Senior Consultant Eye Surgeon, Dr. Saumya Paranawithana, Consultant Eye Surgeon, Dr. Dilruwani Aryasingha, Consultant Eye Surgeon and Niranjan Silva, Chief Operating Officer.

Hamilton reigns at Silverstone
Silverstone, Sunday: Lewis Hamilton swept to his fourth consecutive victory at the British Grand Prix on Sunday to move within a single point of world championship leader Sebastian Vettel.
In a dramatic race packed with incident, Vettel suffered a late puncture and finished seventh for Ferrari after his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen also pitted with a similar problem in the closing stages.
Hamiltons victory, a record-equalling fifth in his home event and the 57th of his career, rebooted his title challenge as he came home ahead of team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who started ninth, in a dominant Mercedes one-two finish.
Its a feeling I just cant describe really, said a delighted Hamilton. Look at this crowd. Thank you to everyone who turned up. God bless you!
It was incredible  I was inspired by all the kids who came.
Raikkonen was third for Ferrari, after the Italian team had made a strategic gamble with their tyres, ahead of Max Verstappen and his Red Bull team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who had started 19th on the grid.
Nico Hulkenberg finished sixth for Renault ahead of Vettel, Esteban Ocon and his Force India team-mate Sergio Perez and Felipe Massa, who came home 10th for Williams.
Bottas said: I am really happy for this today. It was not easy, with so many cars to get through, but the team did a perfect strategy. I just kept my head down and we managed it.
Raikkonen said he was disappointed with his misfortune, but Vettel said he did not blame the team. Its just one of those things, said the German.
Hamilton made a perfect getaway under heavy grey skies while Vettel had flames leaping from his Ferraris brake drum, a distraction that did nothing to stop Verstappen passing him for third on the opening lap.
The two Toro Rosso cars clashed at Chapel where Carlos Sainz spun off into retirement, having collided with Daniil Kvyats car. The Spaniard also made contact with Kevin Magnussens Haas. After an investigation, the stewards gave Kvyat a drive-through penalty.
This accident brought out the safety car for four laps before racing resumed with Hamilton back in control ahead of Raikkonen and Verstappen while Ricciardo climbed to 12th. Bottas, having started ninth after taking a penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, was soon up to fifth with a set of clean passes.
Vettel and Verstappen were scrapping on and off the track in a fight for third, giving the packed crowd several thrilling moments.
Vettel, frustrated by his inability to pass the Dutchman, pitted after 19 laps and rejoined sixth, but moved ahead when Verstappen pitted the following lap and came out behind the German.
This gave Bottas his chance to take third ahead of Vettel and Verstappen, both having swept past Hulkenberg, to run behind Hamilton who led Raikkonen by six seconds. AFP

HSBC named Asias  Best Bank by Euromoney
HSBC has been named Asias Best Bank in the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2017.
This recognition follows Euromoneys announcement last week that it had named HSBC the Worlds Best Bank and Worlds Best Investment Bank in the Emerging Markets for 2017.
The bank is repositioning for growth in Asia and sticking to its mission of financing cross-border capital flows and trade in a more protectionist world, even as other banks retreat to their own borders, said Euromoney in its coverage of the awards.
The editors also highlighted the transformation of HSBC under Stuart Gulliver and its success in delivering good returns to shareholders and helping its clients achieve their international ambitions.
The award for Asias Best Bank was presented at Euromoneys Asia awards ceremony in Hong Kong recently. Peter Wong, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, attended the event, at which HSBC was also named Best Bank and Best Investment Bank for Hong Kong.
These prestigious awards are evidence of our success in executing HSBCs strategy as we pivot to Asia. HSBC is in a leading position across the biggest growth opportunities for our industry in Asia: continued wealth creation, the shift to digital, the liberalisation of Chinas markets, the Belt and Road Initiative and financing a lower carbon economy, said Wong.
Gordon French, Head of Global Banking and Markets, Asia-Pacific, said: Clients recognise the value of partnership with a universal bank that can help them access all available sources of capital as well as balance sheet financing, risk management and transaction banking solutions. These awards reflect the strength of our platform and network.
Stuart Tait, Regional Head of Commercial Banking, Asia-Pacific commented: Winning these awards says clearly that we provide the best services and the best advice in the market. Our collaboration with colleagues across business lines and geographies is a crucial competitive strength that allows us to develop deep relationships with clients to support their growth  both internationally and in the entrepreneurial heartlands of their home markets.

Thilan talks about his new role as the headof the National Agency for PPPs
The Cabinet last week, granted approval to appoint former BOI Chairman and business professional Thilan Wijesinghe as the head of National Agency for Public Private Partnership (PPP) established to fast-track Sri Lankas economic development agenda.
Today, the biggest problem PPP investors are having is the absence of a single Government counterpart agency to talk to. We need to clear the backlog of PPP projects and score some quick wins, said Wijesinghe speaking exclusively to the Daily News.
Following are excerpts of the interview:
Q:You have come out of hibernation; where have you been hiding
I have only been hibernating from active Public Service since I resigned as Chairman and Director General of the BOI in 2001 after holding the position for 5  years. I have, however, been very active in the private sector in the last 16 years, having been CEO/Group Managing Director of several reputed companies, the last two being Forbes and Walker Group and Overseas Realty PLC. Starting 2011, I made a decision to pursue entrepreneurial interests for wanting to spend more time with my family who was living in the US at the time where my two young sons were studying. I decided that I will pursue my passion for investment banking and real estate by choosing partners and clients of my liking, working at my own pace. Secondly, I decided that I will take minority shareholding positions in entrepreneurial ventures by backing good management teams who will run the companies day-to-day, while I will play the role of an active non-executive Chairman or Director.
Q: The government seems to be having a lot of confidence in you and appointed you to chair this agency. Will the new agency have more teeth than the previous unit under the Ministry of Finance
The Cabinet of Ministers has decided that a unit within the Finance Ministry has limited authority and decided that a new National Agency for Public Private Partnerships (NAPP) will be formed with adequate legal, financial and administrative authority to work in consultation with relevant line ministries. At the moment, this is a policy decision and time will be required to work out the right balance between authority and facilitation.
Q: Would the new agency for PPPs be involved with privatisation
No. Securing strategic partners for commercially operating State-owned enterprises requires a different approach and would not be part of the mandate of the NAPPP. PPPs fundamentally relate to the creation of new business models (using dead or under-performing assets of the Government that are not generating an economic return) or creation of new assets via new investments by local and foreign investors.
Q: How much power would the agency have to close deals and make them viable projects for the country
The approach is not to exert 'power.' I do not believe in power emanating from a job title or a set of rules and regulations. What is more important is performance that is based on knowledge and experience and collaboration to earn the respect and cooperation of the line Ministries to ensure that the best possible PPP deal is struck.
A key aspect of PPPs is the fair and equitable allocation of risk between the Government and the private investor. It is in this area and the complex financial and legal structuring that line Ministries have to be guided on. Large PPPs are governed by complex legal agreements that run into 100s of pages. The SAGT Port BOT agreement, which I helped structure in 1998, has over 1,000 pages!
Q: It is obvious that constraints put down by the IMF with regard to borrowings is why the government is going for the PPP formula. But there is an element of government participation. If the government does not have the finances to invest, what would they offer as collateral
PPPs should not be thought of simply as dictates of the IMF or World Bank. PPPs, if done correctly are good for the country and need to be permanently etched in public policy.
For example, PPPs have made the Port and telecom sectors more competitive with far greater service improvements and taxes generated to the State than if these sectors remained as Government-owned monopolies.
The main collateral the Government can offer for successful PPPs is a sound legal and policy environment and some of its dead physical assets to be offered to the private sector at a fair price to generate new capital formation and economic activity.
Q: We understand that there will be people from the private sector on the Board. How will this help in creating a level playing field
No decision has been made on the number or extent of any private sector members on the Board. When I created the PPP unit within the BOI (called the Bureau of Infrastructure Investments or BII), the majority of the BOI Board were top Ministry Secretaries. It is my view that relevant Ministry Secretaries should form the backbone of the Board of the NAPPP
Q: This unit is set to be independent but under the Ministry of Finance and Media. Will it have scrutiny from the independent procurement committees
The NAPPP should always be subject to scrutiny. There will potentially be several layers of scrutiny and oversight. Firstly, the Board, then the line Ministry of the PPP project concerned, then the relevant Cabinet Committee(s) and the Cabinet itself. Finance and Media is the common threadFinance will come into play in looking at financial and economic risk sharing and Media plays a very important role in communicating to stakeholders and the general public the nature and benefits from a particular PPP transaction.
Q: One of the main reasons you have been chosen for this position is probably because you have been the BOI Chairman and the pioneer in PPP projects. But times and rules have changed. What challenges do you see in attracting PPP investments to Sri Lanka
What matters to me is that there is a policy environment and political establishment that recognizes the economic benefits of PPPs.
The next most important consideration is the criteria based on which Government investments versus PPPs will be chosen for an identified project.
There must be rigorous policy analysis and debate on the most optimum source of funding.
What has changed is that the BII that I set up, which had achieved so much from 1996 to 2001 when we implemented around $800 million in PPP transactions at a time of war, became a nonentity soon after my resignation. This was mainly a failure in hiring the right people.
Q: There were some questions about you when you left the BOI. Is there anything you need to clear on this matter
One of the reasons I resigned was to clear my name through Court of a false allegation. This I did successfully. When the final judgment was delivered exonerating me of any wrongdoing, it was based only on the evidence of the first two prosecution witnesses who the Judge found to have given unsatisfactory evidence, and the written submission by the defence. The AGs Department did not make any closing submissions, oral or written.
This effectively established that the charges were malicious and should not have been referred to Court in the first place. In any case, what was important to me was the Court of public opiniondespite a cloud hanging over my head, I had CEO job offers two weeks after I left the BOI and I went on to head public listed companies well before the judgment was delivered in my favour.
Q: Large projects such as garbage, roads and power generation can be done as PPP projects. Do you see these as priority or are there other areas youll be looking into
I have not yet officially studied the PPP project pipeline. However, I expect the PPP net to be cast wide beyond utilities to capture projects in tourism, affordable housing, healthcare, technology etc. During my tenure as Chairman, the BOI and BII implemented PPP-type projects in housing (e.g. Millennium City, Athurugiriya and Nivasie Pura, Ekala, which to date remain the largest ever private family housing projects completed), Hospitals (Apollo/Lanka Hospitals, Asiri Surgical, Nine Wells etc.) and information technology (Millennium IT, Malabe).
Q: Is the Sri Lankan law in place to have PPP agreements Or do you have to create new laws from scratch
We already have many PPPs in operation with complex legal agreements such as SGAT and CICT terminals, Colombo Port City along with smaller projects in mini hydro and power generation.
The combined investment in existing and ongoing PPP projects roughly exceed US$ 3 billion. So why do we need new laws If at all a law is required, it should be to institutionalise the PPP solicitation and execution process. Complex financial and legal structuring and negotiation skills have to be centralized in a PPP agency with persons head-hunted for their competency paying market salary rates, while the policy, technical and engineering aspects remaining within the domain of relevant Government ministries.
Today the biggest problem PPP investors are having is the lack of a single Government counterpart agency to talk to.
Q: What is your vision in PPPs for the next two years
As Lou Gerstner, the CEO who turned around a struggling IBM in the 1990s said when he took up office: the last thing IBM needs is a vision. Similarly, what we need now is to clear the backlog of PPP projects and score some quick wins. The 'vision' will then naturally follow.

IMF Completes Second Review Of Sri Lanka: Approves US$ 167.2 Million Disbursement

The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) yesterday approved disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 119.894 million (about US$ 167.2 million) to Sri Lanka, following the completion of a second review of Sri Lankas economic performance.
The review falls under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement and the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 119.894 million brings total disbursements under the programme to about US$ 501.5 million.
Following the Executive Boards discussion of the review, Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, said:
Sri Lankas performance under the Fund-supported program has been broadly satisfactory. Macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite severe weather events and global market volatility. The authorities launched fundamental income tax reform, undertook meaningful corrective actions to achieve program targets on international reserves, and remain committed to the reform program. Going forward, the reform momentum should strengthen further with greater ownership, building on the progress made so far.
Fiscal performance has been strong. Targets for the fiscal balance and tax revenue have been met. The new Inland Revenue Act, which has been submitted to parliament, will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programs. Nevertheless, Sri Lankas high debt burden and gross financing needs require further revenue-based consolidation. Timely progress in structural reforms, including tax administration and energy pricing, will strengthen the platform for durable consolidation.
Inflation and credit growth remain on the high side. While monetary policy was tightened in March, further tightening is desirable until clear signs emerge that inflation pressures and credit expansion have subsided. While financial soundness indicators remain stable, banks capital adequacy ratio has declined due to rapid credit growth. Financial sector supervision should be strengthened, and macro-prudential measures could be deployed to rein in credit growth if needed.
Continued international reserves accumulation and enhanced exchange rate flexibility, to which the authorities are committed, would reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerabilities.

Immediate steps should be taken to protect rubber lands: CRTA
The Colombo Rubber traders Association (CRTA) recently highlighted the importance of protecting the countrys rubber industry, which has a long history over 100 years, and said authorities should take immediate measures to stop clearing valuable rubber lands for industrial or any other purpose.
CRTA Chairman Sunil Poholiyadda made these observations in Colombo recently.
Plantation Industry Ministry Advisor Lakna Paranawithana and Chamber Representative Alikle Perera were present.
It was highlighted that the main purpose of forming the CRTA was to facilitate efficient and transparency among sellers, producers, buyers, exporters and dealers to assist the growth and sustainability of the Rubber Industry in Sri Lanka and also promote Sri Lankas Rubber and Rubber products in global markets.
Chairman Poholiyadda said the plan would increase the local rubber production up to 30,000 metric tonnes by the year 2045. The Chairman said the Planters Association had identified that over 2,500 hectares of rubber lands of regional plantation companies were going to be cleared for industrial purposes.
He said clearing rubber lands due to urbanization had posed a major threat to the industry.
He said the CRTA would appeal the Government to look into this matter as such a situation would drop the countrys rubber production in future.
Chairman Poholiyadda said the countrys rubber production had reduced to 79 million kilos last year from a record number of 88 million kilos achieved during 2015.
He said the adverse weather conditions prevailed in the past was another reason for the drop in the countrys rubber production. Seventy percent of the countrys rubber production is coming from smallholders and with the drop in price, many rubber growers either discontinue the harvesting or uprooted rubber trees to generate funds. He said a few years ago the price of a rubber kilo went up to Rs. 600 and in 2016, a kilo of the same rubber was dropped to Rs. 200.
He said the prices of natural rubber was increased up to Rs. 400 at the Colombo auction this month.
The Chairman said the domestic consumption of rubber had increased from 127 million kilos in 2015 to 142 million kilos in 2016 .
He reminded the authorities that many plantation companies were interested in expanding rubber cultivation and if alternative additional land was offered to the RPCS even in non-traditional areas, they would gladly accept the offer to expand the rubber cultivation. Plantation Industry Ministry Advisor Lakna Paranawithana mentioned the already launched `Rubber Master Plan  and said that the preparations of this plan was being done.
He said the Ministry had completed the establishment of the Rubber Secretariat at Diyawanna Gardens to develop the industry.

The inside story of the 2013-2014 Ashes triumph by Michael Clarke
Although I am in Melbourne, I have been diligently following the debacles of our ODI team in Sri Lanka; I firmly believe that when I reminisce through Captains Diary written by Michael Clarke, all is not lost for the Sri Lankan cricket team because there are several positives to be taken to put us on the right track.
Clarke played in 105 tests, scored over 8000 runs at an average of over 51with 27 centuries, and captained his country with a style of his own.
I feel that our team in defeat should grow tougher, hungrier and more united, there should not be any room foraging unfit underperforming stars of yesteryear.
Clarke as a captain stamped his authority from the word go.
He states that he always had confidence in the boys, and the boys had confidence in each other. They knew that thissomething about themselves that probably was not apparent to the outside world.
O n their tour of England, they built and refined their plans. For some batsmen like Alistair Cook they settled on their bowling plans early and pursued them throughout, for other batsmen like Bell they had to revise their plans because he was successful in counteracting their earlier plans. It was a matter of having the discipline and control to execute the lines and lengths they wanted to bowl. From batsmen from one to eleven theytalked about their plans, to each of them and took feedback from the bowlers and the fielders, and got themselves to the point where the bowlers knew precisely what they wanted to do, when they got the ball into their hands.
Putting the ball on to the right place is not the only part of the puzzle but having the field setting that will complement the bowling.
Clarke never adhered to the text book in his field setting, for a batsman like Kevin Peterson who always went on the front foot, on slow wickets, Clarke would place his field so that catchers were placed on unorthodox positions between the arch of square leg and mid on, when the wickets were bouncier, he tried leg slips in a number of positions and a short leg behind rather than in front of square. He was pragmatic and results focussed and did not particularly cared how he got there.
Clarke also implies that a captain should strike a balance between planning and letting go of a plan, there must be a proper plan in the first place with an option of changing.
In my opinion, in batting a batsman should treat every ball according to its merit, when the going gets tough, he should concentrate even harder and his defensive skills should come into operation.
In Test cricket, a lot of leaving the ball, defending good balls and remaining water tight in defence are essential.
THE SUPPORT STAFF
In the modern day cricket, support staff plays a role in the teams performance otherwise it can be a waste of money.
If the team is losing to weaker sides in tandem, the way of solving the problem could be a headache; one begins to wonder what the support staffs capabilities are. My personal feeling is that the support staff has a problem in communication. Communication through a third party could be the biggest problem.When this happens the effectiveness of the support staff is blunted.
Indian International cricketers Virat Kohli downwards can understand the Queens language good enough to absorb the points given to them by the support staff.
One wonders what would happen if we get a different set of support staff, who could communicate in our language where the instruction given will be fully absorbed by one another without any confusion.
Bangladesh for instances who have become giant killers in the International cricketing arena, have many Lankans in their support staff plus their Chief Coach. If only we can bring them back to our fold!!
My point is that we have ample cricketing talent at home, we are discovering new talent by the day, when it comes to harnessing it is a different ball game altogether.We lost the one day series to the minnows of World Cricket, one can only hope that the local fan base will not deplete because of our poor show. People upstairs must all pull their socks up and bring Sri Lanka cricket back to their pristine glory of the past.
Getting back to Michael Clarke, he states that there brand of cricket, is that they would play as if they are not afraid to lose. That is easier said than done. Of course one does not want to lose, but if one lets it become a fear, it can paralyse one.One must find a way to conquer fear.
In the field, he says they never let up on their mantra every run counts and fielded in a way that showed they enjoyed every minute of it. As a result their misfields were few and catching almost faultless.
Clarke states that the verbal side of cricket is part of the aggression of the game.The Australian team sometimes cops a bit of flack for its verbal aggression,but they make no apologies when they stay within the code of conduct, and he further adds that there is not much of difference on the verbal side, between international teams. The verbal part of the game is not to hurt the opponent. Its about getting themselves up for the battle.
Clarke used to carry an inspirational message taped to the lining of his bag:
A professional is One who competes against the challenges brought before him by others and is willing to test himself each and every day to be the best he can possibly be and not the best others feel he should be!

Iranian newspapers break  hijab taboo in tributes  to female math genius
Irans newspapers on Sunday broke with the countrys strict rules on female dress to show the mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani with her head uncovered, as the country mourned the death at the age of 40 of the woman known as the queen of mathematics.
Tributes were led by the president, Hassan Rouhani, who posted a recent picture of Mirzakhani on Instagram without a hijab.
The grievous passing of Maryam Mirzakhani, the eminent Iranian and world-renowned mathematician, is very much heartrending, he wrote.
Mirzakhani, a Stanford University professor, died in hospital in California on Saturday after cancer in her breast spread to her bone marrow. The university president, Marc Tessier-Lavigne, said Mirzakhanis influence would live on in the thousands of women she inspired to pursue maths and science.
When in 2014 she became the first woman to win the Fields medal, often described as maths Nobel prize, Iranian newspapers digitally retouched Mirzakhanis photograph to put a scarf over her head while others published a sketch showing only her face. Irans strict laws on female dress require all women to be covered in public.

Key submissions of Chamber included in new Inland Revenue bill
The new Inland Revenue bill, which was gazetted on June 16, was tabled in Parliament on July 5.
Once passed by Parliament, this Bill will replace the existing Inland Revenue Act No 10 of 2006. As indicated by the government, the objective of introducing the new Bill is to broaden the existing tax base, rationalize the existing tax structure, and simplify the language and to align the tax rules with international best practice.
It is the view of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) that formulation of tax policy is the prerogative of the government with due consideration for different stakeholder views.
The Ceylon Chamber was engaged in the drafting stages of the Bill and made several representations to the government on behalf of its members and the general tax paying public without compromising the governments effort of increasing revenue collection.
Some of the key submissions made by the Ceylon Chamber were to maintain the current law relating to taxing dividends, interest, and the business of life insurance, sale of shares in the Colombo Stock Exchange, concessionary rate of tax for thrust industries such as agriculture, education and exports, simplify the capital allowances structure proposed in the new Bill and to maintain the same tax structure.
The CCC is happy to note that most submissions were accepted whilst the Chamber is yet negotiating with government to accept certain provisions to do with the practical implementation of the proposed law.
Finally, it is the view of the Ceylon Chamber that the new Inland Revenue Bill once enacted should be ideally implemented from April 1, 2018, giving a longer transitional period for both the tax payer and the Department of Inland Revenue to become fully conversant with the provisions of the law.
To refer all submissions made by the Ceylon Chamber to the Ministry of Finance during the preparation of the Bill, visit the Ceylon Chamber website (www.chamber.lk) and refer the Submissions to Government section.

Lanka prepared to chase any target  head coach Pothas
Interim head coach Nic Pothas is confident that whatever target that Zimbabwe leaves Sri Lanka with, they will go out and chase.
Theres 12 more overs with the old ball, and then we get a new ball again. Well have to have a chat tonight and see what kind of plan we come up with for tomorrow morning, said Pothas at the end of the third day.
Im always a firm believer that what we see on TV is not reality. Unless I get to speak to the boys that are physically out there, well get a better picture. One step at a time, we need to take four wickets, and once we do that, whatevers set we need to go out and chase. Theres plenty of time left in the game, he said.
Pothas said that he was surprised the way Zimbabwe had fought back in the Test.
They have a quality support staff. They are battlers and fighters. I played against Zimbabwe a long time ago in South Africa. Theyre always going to fight and put up a good show. So its not surprising.
On the condition of the pitch Pothas said that it had changed quite a bit and in the subcontinent you have to accept that.
Once the hardness went out of the ball today, it didnt seem like it did as much as yesterday. Yesterday and day one it spun. But at the end of the day were playing in the subcontinent and wickets spin, said Pothas.
You just need to come up with plans to score, and how youre going to get wickets. It hasnt been anything to write home about. Today it was surprising that it didnt do as much as expected, but we just need to find a way of getting wickets.
Pothas gave credit to both teams the way they tackled the third day pitch.
Youve got to give credit to our players as well as the opposition. Once the hardness went out of the ball, it obviously became a bit more difficult. I thought Raza played really well, as did Moor and Waller. But our guys were phenomenal. They did their jobs, said Pothas. I thought the quality of the fielding was superb. They stuck to their job. It hasnt been easy. But well get up again tomorrow morning, try to get a few quick wickets, and then chase a score.
Pothas who is in his first series as head coach wanted everyone to be patient with the present team.
You need to differentiate between talent and performance. There is an amazing amount of skill in this group. We need to be patient with them, Pothas said. Theyre putting in some good performances. At the moment, were certainly not as consistent as wed like. But give it some time, and youll have a phenomenal cricket team.
A really good fighting chance to win  Waller
Zimbabwe all-rounder Malcolm Waller said that his team was in with a good fighting chance to win the one-off Test against Sri Lanka at the end of the third day.
The guys are extremely positive after the One Day series. It was great and it helped all of us mentally. Weve got a great chance here, said Waller who is unbeaten on 57 out of an unfinished stand of 107 with Sikander Raza.
We can go out there tomorrow and put on another 100 runs and possibly you never know whats going to happen. It will give us a really good fighting chance.
Obviously when you are coming out in the second innings, its always going to be very tough. We had a small lead but its positive. It was really a shaky start and it put us under a lot of pressure in the changing room.
It was a great partnership between Raza and PJ Moor. I think that stabilized the things and brought back the positivity. At the end of the day, we can be happy with what we have achieved, he said.
Waller said the couple of weeks they have spent in Sri Lanka has allowed the team to start gelling really well.
Guys are getting good ideas from Allan James, and definitely, lot more positive in the camp. Guys are in good fighting sprits and everyone is getting on well. Everyone is helping each other and pushing on.
Waller said the mood in the dressing room at lunch was very quite with Zimbabwe on 23-4. It wasnt the ideal start as we lost wickets quickly. But the batters had to remain and we sat down and thought if we guard and fight, be positive and show that you mean business and roll over for nothing. Show what you got and the guys got it in that way.
Batting after lunch wasnt really easy. We saw the odd one do turn. Youre always going to get the odd one that turns and jumps. We focused concentrating on every ball and its never easy out there. Especially, in the second innings in Sri Lanka, the pressure is always on. You just got to keep batting the way you know and back your plans.

The event coincided with the State visit by President Sirisena and a high profile delegation to Bangladesh.
LAUGFS Gas entered the Bangladesh market in 2015 with the acquisition of PetredecElpiji Limited, and is one of the largest LPG downstream players in the country. The company imports and distributes over 50,000 MT of LPG every year in Bangladesh and operates an expansive and a fast growing distribution network across the country.
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have shared a rich history for hundreds of years, especially entwined with trade. We are delighted to be part of this rich legacy and to be able to enrich the lives of the people of Bangladesh with whom we share a unique camaraderie, said LAUGFS Holdings Chairman W.K.H. Wegapitiya at the event.
LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh currently operates a world-class LPG import, bottling and distribution facility in Mongla Port. It serves the domestic and industrial segments with its 12kg cylinders for households and 12kg and 45kg cylinders for commercial and industrial customers under the brand name LAUGFS Gas. It is also the pioneer in Autogas in Bangladesh and supplies LPG to automobile service stations across the country. LAUGFS Gas, with its own vessel fleet, is able to provide LPG with the highest level of reliability.
The LAUGFS Gas brand signifies quality, reliability and safety, said LAUGFS Holdings Group Managing Director, Thilak De Silva.

A law unto themselves
Pictures of security forces personnel who are alleged to be (or had been) subjects of a witch-hunt by the government appeared in a Sunday newspaper political column, with details of why they had been taken in for questioning by the various investigative bodies, too provided by the writer. The line up included two former Army Commanders, a former Navy Commander and an Ex-Air Force Chief, all having served under the Rajapaksa regime. It is being sought in the article to convey the impression that they were being victimized for political reasons with special emphasis given to their impressive records during the war against the LTTE.
There is, though, a glaring omission in the line up - the absence of the Army Commander under whose military leadership the war was brought to a successful end, even though a suggestion is made that he too was made a political victim, though, this has been glossed over in a way to justify the act of throwing him to jail by the Rajapaksas.
Of course, all the hullabaloo is with regard to the arrest of former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P. Dassanayake on charges of causing the disappearance of eleven persons in 2008. Speaker after speaker of Joint Opposition politicians are seen on a pro-Rajapaksa TV channel in almost every news segment proclaiming that the arrest, of whom they claim is a highly decorated officer, who risked his life on the high seas to fight the LTTE, was being victimized at the behest of the Tamil diaspora and to make good the promises made to the UNHRC to bring to book those responsible for war crimes.
A communal flavour too is being added to the whole affair by the Gammanpila - Weerawansa duo, as is their wont, in an obviously attempt to rouse the sentiments of the majority community, for political gain. The constant refrain of the JO MPs is that members of the security forces are beyond reproach and untouchable, all because they fought the good battle, and that the government, by doing so, is pandering to dictates of the international community. In their reckoning, the War Heroes can do no wrong and if any member of the security forces had been responsible for the disappearance of persons, abductions and cover up of murders, so what
However none of these feelings for the country's War Heroes was seen when the war winning Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka was dragged away and thrown behind bars after a sham Court Martial and forced into a prison jumper. Those weeping buckets for the War Heroes being arrested kept mum when military personnel who provided security to Presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka was made to kneel on the driveway of a five star hotel where the latter was billeted on election night Where were messrs. Weerawansa and Gammanpila when the former Army Commander was virtually frog-marched to courts from the prison almost on a daily basis to answer summons to the series of cases that were framed against him Whatever happened to all these cases, since Rajapaksa was still in power when Fonseka was released from prison where he spent two years Why was no voice raised by the JO big mouths and the members of the Sangha who are today and fuming and foaming over the arrest of War Heroes when Fonseka was stripped of all rank and deprived of his pension by the Rajapaksas who even went to the extent of engineering a rift within the Malwatte Chapter for trying the espouse the cause of the jailed ex-Army Commander.
The arrest of Commodore Dassanayake and other members of the armed forces did not come out of the blue. These followed comprehensive investigations and after carefully going through all evidence and the relevant material. Arrests of War Heroes, or any citizen, for that matter, cannot be made on a whim at the instance of the Tamil diaspora or the international community. It simply does not make sense. Not just Commodore Dassanayake, a large number of military personnel had been arrested, in recent times, in the normal course of events, by the police. The recent arrest of an ex-soldier, for the robbery of gold items, from a number of jewellery shops, is a case in point. Are the likes of Weerawansa and Gammanpila suggesting that the law enforcement simply look the other way and turn a blind eye to the criminal acts committed by military personnel, just because they fought the LTTE Will not the country descend to anarchy and lawlessness if the police maintain a hands off attitude to servicemen all because they were on the battlefield
No citizen can be above the law, which has to apply equally to all, if we are to call ourselves a civilized nation. Military personnel, arrested, for whatever offence, are free to defend themselves like all other citizens. Claiming immunity for members of the security forces on the grounds that they defeated terrorism is indeed a dangerous ploy, that could have grave consequences, akin to a license to kill.

## Title: Lets say GoodBye to polythene bags
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, July 18, 2017 - 01:00
Lets say GoodBye to polythene bags
Throughout the world, around one trillion polythene bags are consumed every year, equating to 2 million per minute. Different countries have different usage levels, but the entire world has now realised the menace and begun to reduce this usage.
Polythene is a fantastic material that has greatly improved the world. At the same time, it has killed millions of animals and plants and destroyed the serenity and eco-balance of the planet as a whole.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that 15 kilos of polythene are discarded by each person per month and over five hundred thousand tons of polythene materials are imported to Sri Lanka annually to meet this demand.
Hazards
The single fact that polythene bags are non-biodegradable makes them unfit for usage on account of their impossible disposal problem. Environmentalists estimate that polythene bags could take anywhere up to 1,000 years to disintegrate.
The used and discarded polythene bags thrown and dumped carelessly everywhere causes enormous pollution problems in the environment. These include:
(a) They degrade soil, which becomes contaminated with the toxic chemicals present in them; (b) they choke sewer pipes and clog drains resulting into water-logging and disruption of the entire drainage system in an area or cities; (c) they are often times eaten up by livestock that die after consuming them; (c) To destroy polythene bags, we can either recycle or burn them. If we burn, they emit harmful chemical gases like carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, methane, sulphur dioxide etc.
These gases pollute our environment; (d) the wastes of polythene bags, sheets, etc. are drawn to a sea or an ocean by rivers and they are deposited in them. They pollute and disturb the eco-system of the sea or the ocean.
Ban
Taking into consideration all these hazards and in a bid to make Sri Lanka polythene-free and find a sustainable solution to solid waste management, President Maithripala Sirisena recently announced a number of measures including the ban on the import, manufacture and sale of lunch sheets and a ban on the use of polythene for decorations.
The short-term measures also included the ban on the plates, cups, spoons made of polystyrene and the ban on meals packed in polythene containers. The measures also recommend the promotion of paper, cloth or reed bags or biologically degradable plastics for customers when purchasing items in stores, prohibition of burning polythene and plastic in open places and introduction and promotion of biologically degradable polythene and plastics.
These decisions appear to have won the support of majority of Sri Lankans, if media comments are anything to go by. The ban, if properly implemented, will go a long way in ensuring environmental integrity, and as a Government Minister pointed out, would reduce at least on third of the waste collected in major cities.
Success stories
In order to tackle this monstrous issue, many countries have either implemented bans on usage of polythene bags or levied fees for their use. The oldest is in Denmark, which started in 1993, and with the implementation of a levy on polythene bags. The result was drop of usage by 60% within three years. Ireland also followed suit and in 2002 introduced polythene bag tax. Within three years polythene bag usage dropped by 90 per cent.
Ireland and Denmark are just two successful examples and many other countries across the world have followed them. The European Union will require an 80% reduction of plastic bags by 2019. This means virtually every European country is now considering ways to bring about heavy reductions in polythene bag usage. Not only EU countries, more than 30 outside countries have implemented outright ban of the usage of polythene bags and have witnessed positive results.
Rwanda
But the most classic example comes from Rwanda. Located in Eastern Africa, this country is largely known for its tragic genocide that exploded in April 1994. Since then it has tended to operate as a relatively unknown country outside certain political and economic circles. However, for such a small, developing nation it is home to a variety of unique, forward thinking policies.
In early 2000s, Rwanda became concerned about the menace of polythene bags. The initiative was a response to the two most common ailments caused by polythene: a well-documented understanding of polythenes negative environmental impacts, but equally influential, the extensive physical presence of bags around the country. In addition to the visual pollution, research from the National University of Rwanda reported the widespread environmental consequences of polythene. This information signalled the turning point. It not only sensitized many Rwandans to the problem of polythene within the country, but it got politicians thinking about the issue as well. A nation-wide campaign began by flooding the media. Furthermore, local NGOs and businesses were commissioned to create alternatives -mainly cotton or banana leaf bags. The advocacy was a success and in 2008 a bill was finally passed to ban polythene bags within Rwanda.
Alternatives
The benefits of Rwandas polythene bag ban were quickly evident: in 2008 UN Habitat named Kigali the cleanest city in all of Africa. Now nine years since the bill was passed, Rwanda remains a plastic bag-free country, and has developed a reputation across the region for its extreme cleanliness. The passing of the bill coupled with Rwandas monthly day of cleaning has insured that it remains this way, and will continue for the foreseeable future.
Just saying no to polythene bags is not enough. We need to go for alternatives such as eco-friendly bags. Jute bags and cloth bags. Recycled paper can also be used to make carry bags as substitution of polythene bags.
Most of the eco-friendly bags are made of natural fibres which are biodegradable. These bags are not only attractive but also durable and long lasting. Made of attractive and light weight fabrics, these bags are comfortable and economical. In addition, the demand will create thousands of opportunities for local employment.
Golden rule
At the same time, there are research going on to produce polythene from sugarcane and starch. Scientists believe it is a matter of time that completely biodegradable and eco-friendly bags will be in the market bio-ethanol derived from sugarcane and starch.
Till such times that we are able to substitute the non-degradable polythene by a degradable counterpart, the golden rule that must be followed is to shift to biodegradable products. When each one of us pass on this message to ones neighbours, friends and relatives, the cascading effect would be seen in the society which is required for the safety of our cattle, wildlife, crops, our own selves and our environment as a whole. Reverse transformation from our throw-away, easy going mentality is required for solving the polythene menace.
Electronic news media, corporate sector and university students are three collective entities that could make a discernible difference. Popular TV talk show anchors could promote the use of cotton bags and jute and cane baskets in their shows conducted in and out of the studios. Big businesses could distribute cotton bags and cane baskets through their mobile floats and company vehicles; they could brand them for free brand promotion and corporate goodwill.
The university students could have their very own student life business projects of running stalls in different weekly and holiday bazaars to sell cotton bags and cane baskets with fashionable designs and styles and build their business reflexes. Little but consistent efforts across the country could in the end make a big difference.
Our duty
As citizens, we must commend the government for bringing policies to curb excessive usage of polythene bags. The directives have not yet banned the polythene bags, but directed retailers to use biodegradable bags.
This writer wishes to suggest that the government declare everyday No polythene bag policy nationwide which makes it compulsory for consumers to buy a biodegradable bag when making purchases. But if a consumer insists on a polythene bag, a government levy should be charged, as some of the countries are presently doing. The government can allow the public to buy plastic bags including the levy, but must set a timeframe to discontinue this practice.
The government also should work closely with all stakeholders on environmental protection educational programmes, emphasising on anti-litter campaigns while encouraging consumers to opt for re-usable bags.
On the other hand, we as responsible citizens, must discharge our individual roles and responsibilities by embracing environmental friendly practices in our daily lives. If we change our present attitudes we will be able to witness tangible results. Protecting the environment is not solely the responsibility of the government and positive results can never be achieved if we do not work collaboratively.
Change must begin with us!

LG Elections Bill to be presented in Parliament next week
The Bill on the Local Government(LG) Elections would be presented in Parliament next week since all the affairs by the government with regard to the election is completed, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
He also said that although various politicians and sections of the media level allegations that the government is not holding the elections, what really has happened is that the Bill which was drafted on the election of members to the Local Government institutions previously had many flaws.
President Sirisena made these observations at the national workshop held to educate the heads of Local Government institutions on garbage management and controlling the dengue epidemic.
The workshop was held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI).
The President also stated that a long lasting mechanism on garbage management will be formulated within a few months following discussions with the secretaries to the Local Government institutions.
But so far not a single government had implemented a proper garbage management mechanism, President Sirisena said.
All must work together solve the garbage and Dengue issues without levelling various accusations,the President said.
The President also said that the Government hopes to solve these issues soon and will not burder the next Government with the same problems.

Furthermore they were ordered to refrain from entering into government establishments forcefully, disrupting peace and order.
The protest is against legalizing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

Made-in-India warship to be largest in Sri Lankan Navys fleet
The Sri Lankan Navy is on the verge of commissioning its largest warship, which has been built in India under a Rs 1,000-crore contract inked four years ago for two such vessels.
The manufacturer, state-owned Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL), will deliver the first offshore patrol vessel to the Sri Lankan Navy at a ceremony at the yard on July 22.
The 105-metre long warship, with a displacement of around 2,400 tonnes, is expected to be commissioned into the Sri Lankan Navy on August 2.
It will be the largest warship to be operated by the Sri Lankan Navy. It is also the largest warship to be exported by an Indian shipyard. The step will deepen naval ties between the two countries, Rear Admiral Shekhar Mital told HT from Goa.
The shipyard has beaten the deadline for delivering the warship because of which the Sri Lankan Navy will induct the vessel almost three months ahead of the scheduled delivery. Sri Lanka will get the second warship in February 2018, again three months ahead of schedule.
Such patrol vessels carry out several roles including fleet support operations, maritime surveillance, defence of offshore installations and escorting high value ships.
Capable of reaching a top speed of 25 knots, the vessels have been designed to accommodate a helicopter on their flight decks.
The shipyard will also deliver a fast patrol vessel to Mauritius on August 9, the 14th such vessel to be delivered to that country during the last two years. - Hindustan Times

Manufacturing sector PMI drops 1.8 index points in June
The Manufacturing Sector PMI recorded 56.1 in June which is a decrease of 1.8 index points compared to May 2017.
This indicates that the manufacturing activities expanded, albeit at a slower rate in June 2017, mainly due to the decrease in New Orders and Production sub-indices which were partly influenced by the adverse weather conditions.
As a result, excessive stock levels were created and a marginal decline in lengthening of the suppliers delivery time was experienced. However, the employment level improved recovering from the contraction experienced in the previous month. Further, all the sub-indices of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50 threshold signalling an overall expansion. Moreover, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months.
The Services Sector PMI recorded 59.2 index points in June from 55.3 index points in May 2017.
The acceleration in services sector was supported by new businesses, business activity, employment and expectations for activity. Backlogs of work declined, at a moderate pace compared to May 2017. Financial sector contributed to the acceleration in new businesses through adoption of technological advancement to serve their clientele. An increase in business activity levels was reported, mainly in the health sector.
Accommodation, food and beverage sector expects an increase in activity levels in the next 3 months due to anticipated growth in both domestic and foreign tourist activities.
Prices Charged index experienced no change in June compared to May 2017 in the absence of any festival demand. Meanwhile, expectations on labour cost increased marginally in June 2017 due to the increase in the employment level.

Moratuwa Uni. denies  hand in killing of dogs: Blames Private Contractor
Vice Chancellor of the University of Moratuwa Prof. A.K.W. Jayewardene has denied a role in the inhumane killing of dogs and cats at the premises, and instead, blamed a private contractor. We hired a private contractor to chase away stray dogs and cats but we never asked them to drug and kill the animals, he told Daily News Online.
It was their decision to sedate, remove and dump the stray dogs and cats, Vice Chancellor Jayewardene said.
He said the issue had occurred after one or two dogs had been overdosed on the tranquiliser Ketamine but added that he had instructed officials not to use such methods hereafter.
Animal rights activists were up in arms over the video and image evidence circulating the Internet of the inhumane killing of dogs and cats at the university premises. Moratuwa University Vice Chancellor Prof. A. K. W.Jayewardene however said the images were false and that he called a meeting with activists to clear the universities involvement.
He also denied the charge he had brought pressure on the university students who were circulating the images and video evidence, to remove them off social media.
The incident comes hot on the heels of community dogs at the Sri Jayawardenepura University being rounded up and dumped elsewhere.
Efforts to locate the dogs have proved futile. Activists are holding Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha responsible for what they term mass killings of dogs and cats.

Never found a more neutral person
Filmmaker Sabbir Khan, who has teamed up with Nawazuddin Siddiqui for Munna Michael, says the best part about the actor is that he doesnt have a know-it-all attitude despite being a very good performer. The filmmaker says Nawazuddin completely surrenders to a directors vision.
Hes a directors actor. Ive never found a more neutral person. He comes with completely neutrality on sets. He waits for you to say what you want and he will do that. He is such a delight to work with, Sabbir told PTI. The film chronicles the story of a young man from the streets, called Munna, played by Tiger Shroff, who is a big fan of Michael Jackson. Munna then gives dance lessons to Mahinder Fauji, played by Nawazuddin, who is a gangster.
Sabbir says both Tiger and the Gangs of Wasseypur star rehearsed a lot prior to shooting the film. The beauty of Nawazuddin is that he doesnt interfere with the film. We had a complete bound script and both Tiger and Nawazuddin did workshops. We set the tone of how both the characters will act, so there was very little room on sets to make changes.
While this is his third film with Tiger after hits like Heropanti and Baaghi, Sabbir says convincing Nawazuddin for the film wasnt difficult at all. Nawazuddin said yes to the film in 10 minutes. While scripting, I had a very strong instinct that I wanted Nawazuddin in the film. So, I reached out to him assuming he will either say are you mad or immediately agree. Fortunately, even before I finished the script, he got up and said I am doing this film. We had coffee and sat down and after ten minutes I told him that he would have to dance in the film. He smiled and said he knew it. Sabbir says though he agreed to dance, Nawazuddin was still initially hesitant.
Whenever we would schedule our dance portions, he used to call and say, thoda push kare But then eventually I told him that the scenes will have to be shot. The film is scheduled to release on July 21.

New Constitution, a dire need
In 1965, negotiations conducted between FP leader Chelvanayakam and Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake on March 24 brought forth the Dudley-Chelvanayakam pact (D-C Pact). Here again, arose racist, extremist opposition to the Pact notwithstanding its lesser parameters than the B-C pact. Dudley Senanayake easily succumbed and lost no time to abrogate the pact which provided for (a) the Tamil language to be the language of administration in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, (b) Legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces will be conducted and recorded in Tamil (c) District Councils to be established in the country with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between the two leaders
Racism and religious bigotry, the double-edged scourge, has ever been the enormous impediment for the forward march of Sri Lanka. In the countrys recent history, such a phenomenon emerged in the early last century, and has persisted to this day in varying degrees.
Even though the situation was initially relatively peaceful when Independence from foreign rule dawned in 1948, and the economic situation apparently signaling a forward movement, thanks especially to the Korean war boom and the Rubber-Rice pact with China, it soon began to change drastically for the worse with the rise of Sinhala-Buddhist hegemonic positions. As is well known, on the occasion of the 1956 elections, both the UNP as well as the SLFP vied with each other to make Sinhala the sole official language.
On his visit to Jaffna on the verge of the 1956 General Elections, the then Prime Minister, Sir John Kotelawela, made a pledge, inter alia, to accord official language status to Tamil as well. It provoked strong resistance in the South, and the UNP swiftly changed course to make Sinhala the sole official language, as the election pledge. And, not to lag behind, SLFP leader, S.W.R.D Bandaranaike had no qualms jettisoning his own pledge to make Sinhala and Tamil official languages when he founded the SLFP in 1951. Thus, in his bid to outwit the UNP, Bandaranaike announced Sinhala Only within 24 hours as his battle cry.
The LSSP then made the historic warning, Two languages, one Nation, One language, 2 Nations, nay two bleeding halves, as prophesied by Colvin R de Silva, that it would someday lead to a demand by the Tamils for a separate State. And the Tamil leaders opposed the Sinhala Only bill because exclusion of the Tamil language would not only be repugnant to the principle of justice and fair-play, but also constituted an infringement of the letter and spirit of section 29 of the Soulbury Constitution then in force. But Bandaranaike would not relent, for his own opportunistic reasons which propelled his election pledge.
What followed was a call by the Federal Party leader, S. J. V. Chelvanayakam, for a civil disobedience campaign. However, in order to forestall such an eventuality, Bandaranaike opened negotiations with the Federal Party leader and entered into what came to be known as the Bandaranike-Chelvanayakam Pact (BC Pact) on July 26, 1957. Bandaranaike then launched a campaign to explain the need for such a pact, extolling his own virtues as a true Buddhist. Strong opposition to the pact was mounted by the Sinhala Buddhist constituency, as a sell-out to the Tamils. Adding weight to that campaign was the protest march to Kandy launched by UNP strongman J. R. Jayewardena. Meantime, the Buddhist clergy intensified their opposition to the Pact, culminating in a siege on Bandaranaikes Rosmead Place residence on April 9, 1958, raising an implacable hue and cry, and Bandaranaike found himself with no option but to cave in; a bi-lateral pact was instantly abrogated unilaterally.
What indeed did the B-C pact provide for Certainly not for any federal arrangement, nor any change in the Sinhala Only Act, but of course (a) Establishment of a Regional Council for the Northern Province, and two or more such entities for the Eastern Province, with powers over specified subject including agriculture, co-operatives, lands and land development, colonization, education, health, industries, fisheries, housing, social services, electricity, water schemes and roads. (b) It was agreed that in the matter of colonization schemes, the powers of the Regional Council shall include power to select allottees to whom lands within their areas of authority shall be alienated, and power to select the personnel to work on such schemes, (c) The Central Government will provide block grants to the Regional Councils which will also have powers of taxation and borrowing.
Upon reaching this framework agreement, the Federal Party Leader agreed to cancel the Satyagraha campaign that had been planned. Lo and behold, it didnt take long for anti- Tamil riots to be unleashed by the racist forces, which the then redoubtable English journalist of Sunday Observer fame, Tarzie Vitachchi, described as mans inhumanity to man Bandararanaike not only refused to declare a State of Emergency which some prominent citizens jointly urged was warranted. On the contrary, Bandaranaike went on to address the Nation, and Vitachhi described the speech as raw oxygen blown into a raging fire, thus escalating the riots which Vitachchi exhaustively documented in his book titled Emergency 58 - History of the Ceylon Race riots. Bandaranaikes own interpretation of the unfolding events and his awful contribution was to add fuel to the fire as Vittachi chose to add. That is to say, whereas the riots broke out on May 22, 1958, Bandaranaike misled the country in his broadcast to the Nation on 26.05.1958, maintaining that the murder of the former Mayor of Nuwara Eliya, D. A. Seneviratne in Batticaloa (and some others) on June 25 was the incident that led to the riots breaking out. Federal Party Leader Chelvanayakam stated in Parliament on June 4, 1958 that murder of Seneviratne arose out of a private feud, and that was not contradicted from any quarter.
Dudley-Chelvanayajam pact
In 1965, negotiations conducted between FP leader Chelvanayakam and Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake on March 24 brought forth the Dudley-Chelvanayakam pact (D-C Pact). Here again, arose racist, extremist opposition to the Pact notwithstanding its lesser parameters than the B-C pact. Dudley Senanayake easily succumbed and lost no time to abrogate the pact which provided for (a) the Tamil language to be the language of administration in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, (b) Legal proceedings in the Northern and Eastern Provinces will be conducted and recorded in Tamil (c) District Councils to be established in the country with powers over subjects to be mutually agreed upon between the two leaders.
It was agreed, however, that the Government should have the power under the law to give direction to such Councils under the national interest. And then, Mr Senanayake further agreed that in the matter of granting land under colonization schemes, the following priorities be observed in the Northern and Eastern Provinces: (a) Land in the Northern and Eastern Provinces should in the first instance be granted to landless persons in the District, (b) Secondly, to Tamil-speaking residents in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, (c) Thirdly, to other citizens in the country, preference being given to Tamil citizens in the rest of the Island. So, had either of these pacts been implemented, Tamil armed struggle which, objectively speaking, came on the scene as a last resort, could well have been obviated, leaving no cause for the 26-year long war, which the worst 1983 anti-Tamil riots (Black July) precipitated.
Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC)
This Commission, appointed by former President Mahinda Rajpaksa in 2010, headed by a former Attorney-General, the late C.R de Silva, pinpointed, inter ala, that there had been periodical, anti-Tamil violence, culminating in war, since none of the Governments since Independence took concrete measures to resolve the Tamil national question, and strongly recommended that a viable solution would soon have to be found.
Superficial analysis by certain commentators
And many a commentator is seen to be identifying the LTTE as the root cause of the war, scarcely bothering to delve even into the genesis of the LTTE. And there are those who lash out at the Tamil Diaspora, oblivious to the reason for their exit en masse, especially post 1983. The human cost of the war, both civilians as well as the Armed Forces, is colossal, and at the same time the financial cost is a whopping 200 billion US Dollars, according to a survey carried out by former Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka, Shiv Shankar Menon.
So no one in his/her right senses should stand in the way of a sustainable solution to the chequered Tamil national question to be written into a new Constitution as pledged by the two ruling parties, constituting the incumbent National Unity Government, during the 2015 Presidential and Parliamentary elections. For that matter, it goes without saying that the Tamils, as well as the Muslims, though minorities numerically speaking, are in fact part and parcel of the sovereign people of this country, and are not calling for any concessions or bounties to be bestowed on them, except their inalienable right to share power.
Thus, a New Constitution, and a New Way is the need of the hour for Sri Lanka.

Over 6,000  firefighters battle California wildfires
US: More than 6,000 firefighters battled 14 large wildfires across California Monday as hot, dry and windy conditions in many areas fanned flames, forcing thousands of evacuations and destroying dozens of structures.
One blaze scorched vineyards in a major wine region of the state and another briefly trapped youth at a summer camp. Australian vintner Treasury Wine Estates confirmed to CNBC that one of its California vineyards was damaged in the wildfires. Three of the largest fires burning now in the state have already charred more than 54,000 acres, or about 84 square miles. The state's five-year drought left extremely dry vegetation and winter rains produced thick grasses, which are now drying out and providing the perfect fuel for massive fires.
The drought-stressed vegetation is still out there with an abundant grass crop that we have across the state, Cal Fire spokeswoman Amy Head said Monday. Those are both factors contributing to the number of fires that we're seeing.
Overall, California has seen an amount of acreage charred so far this year that is more than double the amount at the same period last year, according to Cal Fire. The risk of fire remains high statewide with more than 100 million dead trees in California forests following the long drought.
The busy start to the fire season could result in increased firefighting costs for the state at a time when California is seeing its state revenues fall below forecasts. On Monday, the state Controller's Office reported that monthly revenues for June were about $2.7 billion short of projections in the governor's revised budget.
The state spent more than $210 million last year during the wildfire season and so far this season it appears to be spending money at a faster pace than last June or July in order to keep up with the growing number of fires.

Pan Asia Bank lauded by Bdesh central bank for preventing worlds largest bank heist
Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC last week received praise from the top most official of Bangladesh central bank for the foremost role the bank played in preventing in what could have been the worlds biggest bank robberies in the history.
In February 2016, unidentified hackers breached Bangladesh Banks systems and stole its credentials for payment transfers.
The hackers then bombarded the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with nearly three dozen requests to move money from Bangladesh Banks account held at the Fed to entities in the Philippines and Sri Lanka.
While four such requests by the hackers to transfer a total of US$ 81 million to Philippines went through, the fifth amounted to US$ 20 million sent to Shalika Foundation  a non-governmental organization (NGO) - reached through Pan Asia Bank was held up due to the extreme cautiousness followed by the latter at all times as the nature of the transaction was suspicious.
Pan Asia Bank then alerted the necessary authorities about the suspicious fund transfer which then transpired as a part of bigger hacking involving the Bangladesh central bank.
This extreme vigilance of the bank enabled Pan Asia Bank to prevent a nearly US$ 1.0 billion in transfers to different parts of the world by these hackers of moneys belonging to the Bangladesh central bank and the New York Fed last year.
In appreciation of this central role played by Pan Asia Bank, Bangladesh Bank Governor Fazle Kabir who was in Sri Lanka last week met with Pan Asia Banks Chief Executive Officer Nimal Tillekeratne at the Central Bank to commend the bank and its employees for their role which helped them to uncover a web of similar hacks involving its central bank.
Pan Asia Bank will continue to play its national role as a responsible bank by being on alert at all times to ensure that suspicious transactions carried out at the expense of national interests are reported and brought to the attention of the enforcement agencies.
Further as the custodian of the hard earned moneys of the people, Pan Asia Bank always takes utmost caution when handling moneys and ensures that no activity which could compromise the safety of the moneys of its customers is condoned.
For this purpose, the bank continuously invests on training and development of its highly skilled staff, updates its systems to their latest versions and streamlines its processes because for Pan Asia Bank, the security of the funds of its customers is a top most priority.

Pan Asia Bank receives Best Employer Brand Award
Sri Lankas fastest growing commercial bank, Pan Asia Banking Corporation PLC was recognized as the Best Employer Brand at the 12th Best Employer Brand Awards organized by the World HRD Congress held in Colombo last week.
The award recognized Pan Asia Banks benchmark human resource practices and some of the most innovative measures deployed to attract, develop and retain the best talent.
For instance, the banks benchmark internship programme, Pan Asia Stargate established recently with the Institute of Bankers, Sri Lanka, to identify and develop the brightest and most enthusiastic school leavers seeking a career in banking. This is one of many initiatives by the bank to find and build a talent pool which can take on the future challenges. This is in addition to many unique Human Resource Management and Human Resource Development programmes introduced by the bank to promote bench mark HR practices across the bank.
Pan Asia Banks Head of Human Resources Rohitha Amarapala attributed this success to its policies and activities rolled out in the last couple of years ago to build a well contended workforce which has been the single most important asset in the Bank.
I would like to dedicate this award to all our staff at Pan Asia Bank without whom this would not have been possible because this award manifests the efforts of our staff who went that extra mile to deliver their best said Rohitha Amarapala.
Without them we would not have been able to record our recent successes in the spheres of financial and business performance, corporate social responsibility, product innovation, and in particular our exemplary customer service.
Pan Asia Bank became the Overall Winner at the 2016 National Business Excellence Awards for its excellent business and financial results while emerging the runners up in the banking sector.
Pan Asia Bank last year developed and deployed over 150 certified departmental trainers - probably the largest internal trainers cadre in the industry - who took the mantle of training the next generation of leaders.
Through these initiatives Pan Asia Bank has been developing its young talent to take on tomorrows business challenges.
Pan Asia Bank also boasts of having the youngest staff pool in the industry and has deployed proactive strategies to meet the skill dearth in the banking sector.
The evaluation criteria for the World HRD Congress Best Employer Brand Award included criteria to ascertain whether the banks human resource strategy complements the overall corporate strategy and whether the bank cultivates competencies to build a future-ready workforce.

Patience and discipline will  play huge roles today  Raza
Zimbabwes savior with the bat Sikandar Raza said that if his team is to win the one-off Test against Sri Lanka today patience and discipline will play a key role.
If we can stay disciplined and patient, there is enough for Sean Williams and (Graeme) Cremer and the other spinners as well  for balls to misbehave, said Raza at the end of the fourth day of the Test.
You could get a jaffa that you cant do much about. On a track like this, once you get the senior players out, with their batting at the moment, could open a door for us to sneak through.
Zimbabwes ploy against Sri Lanka was to pitch the ball on the leg stump or outside it.
We discussed with Sean, and because there was a lot of turn with that dismissal. The moment they try and get greedy to score, the slip could come into play, the off stump could be exposed, and we could sneak in a wicket there, explained Raza. We wanted to hold one end so that Cremer can attack from the other. While we are holding it, were still creating a few chances.
Raza paid a tribute to former South African all-rounder Lance Klusener who has been helping them with their batting as coach.
The heads were down for a little while during that lunch break when we were 23 for 4. Lance Klusener had a word with us and said that its up to us  the guys who were still to bat  whether we go down without a fight, or we show some heart, said Raza.
The plans come from us. We discuss and share our plans with Klusener and then he has his input. Of course he has a world of experience. If I have a plan which I think is too risky, Klusener will always advise me and say you could have a better plan  do XYZ. Its quite a nice relationship all the batters have got with our batting coach.
Raza who scored his maiden Test hundred said, Its quite humbling to get my first hundred under these circumstances. It is pretty satisfying. Whats more satisfying is that we were in a bit of a hole, and everyone starting from the partnership that we had with PJ Moor, and then on to Waller, and then to Cremer, were all excellent.
To be 388 ahead, going into the last day against Sri Lanka, in Sri Lanka, is a pretty good effort. Its an effort that were confident that the result can go our way as well.
Raza said that since Heath Streak took over as head coach and Tatenda Taibu as head selector Zimbabwe have had a settled team in the last six months or so.
We havent had a lot of changes in our touring 15 or playing eleven either. Every time someone has got a chance in the playing eleven, theyve stepped up as well, said Raza. Good thing is even the boys on the bench have proven their strength. Theyve taken their opportunities when presented. Since these two gentlemen have taken over, weve had a very consistent squad, and that goes hand in hand with consistent performances as well.
I personally think that Zimbabwe cricket is going forward. Weve been playing some decent cricket. Sometimes results dont go your way. In my opinion, as long as youre doing the right thing, working hard, and being positive, results will fall into place.
This one could go either way. But having said that, were all proud of how we have played, how we have represented our country. Well give it another fight tomorrow, and try and win the Test match.

PM expounds on positives of national government
Maintaining a national government in power is a difficult endeavour, but every effort should be taken to keep it going for the sake of the immense benefits which will accrue to the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Addressing a meeting which followed the laying of foundation stones for the several stages of the Viyathpura middle class housing scheme at Weera Mawatha, Pannipitiya, the Prime Minister said the benefits of building a market economy with social justice will accrue not only to the UNP and the SLFP but to all citizens in the country.
The Prime Minister, who said that the Viythapura Urban Housing Scheme was one segment of the governments economic development programme, added that the government had to pay back Rs. 4,200,000 million next year alone as dues on the immense debt burden left over by the previous regime.
A market economy was needed to facilitate this task, the Prime Minister said.
He said benefits of the market economy could not be restricted to a few industrialists and business persons only. These benefits should filter down to the employees too because the market economy and social justice should go hand in hand as two sides of the same coin.
The Prime Minister said that he held discussions with Trade Unions in the IPZ last week and added that they were finding out the manner in which a share of the income from increased production could be distributed among employees. Premier Wickremesinghe said two more accomplishments were needed to provide more benefits to the people. The school system would be developed by making education compulsory for 13 years and providing technical education to students left out of university education.
The PM said the government had launched a massive programme to provide housing to shanty dwellers and the middle class. Flats with infrastructure facilities would be built in urban areas. Kurunegala, Kuliyapitiya, Chilaw, Kandy and Galle would become large urban centres in another 10 years.
Provision of separate housing schemes for professionals was an idea mooted by Minister Patali Champika Ranawake, who had also undertaken the responsibility to resolve vehicle congestion in the city and the suburbs. Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawake also spoke. Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Dr. Wijedasa Rajapakshe, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and Provincial Council members Rodney Fraser and Namal R. Pieris were also present on the occasion.

Presidential Commission Investigating into CB Bond Issue: Treasury Deputy Secretary unaware of additional cash requirement
Treasury Deputy Secretary S.R. Attygalle yesterday said that he was unaware of an additional cash requirement for February in 2015, which could have prompted an acceptance of Rs. 10.5 billion at the auction held on February 27, 2015.
Attygalle was giving evidence before the Presidential Commission Investigating into the Central Bank Bond Issue yesterday.
Attygalle said so when questioned by Justice Commissioner P.S. Jayawardena. He said he cannot recall whether there was such an additional requirement. He said, Neither the Finance Minister or the Finance Ministry Secretary told me that there was such an additional debt requirement.
Justice Jayawardena asked the witness if there is a process followed by the Treasury Operations Department (TOD) lest there shall be a sudden cash requirement, to which Attygalle answered in affirmative. He said the general structured borrowing process would be to notice the Central Bank in written form regarding the cash requirement.
It was also revealed that there was no short fall in the cash requirement in January 2015.
Justice Jayawardena asked Attygalle whether there would always be a written request sent to the Central Bank when notifying a sudden cash requirement, to which Attygalle said mostly it would be so.
Even if we communicate such information to the Central Bank via telephone for example, they make sure we send the request through the written form as well.
The decision by former Governor Arjun Mahendran to accept 10.5 billion bids at the auction, has been argued for on the basis that there was an additional cash requirement for February and March.
According to previous evidence led at the Commission, the details of such an additional cash requirement was discussed at the Breakfast-meeting which took place on February 23, 2015 at the Central Bank premises, among several ministers and high ranking Central Bank and ministry officials. More evidence has led to suggest that the Public Debt Department was unable to raise the governments debt requirement for the same months.
On May 16, 2017 Mahendrans lawyer Chanaka de Silva produced a letter signed by the then Finance Minister in which it mentions that a decision was taken to raise Rs. 75 billion to fulfill government requirements. The produced letter was undated.
Chanaka de Silva is to examine Attygalle today.
Meanwhile, lawyer Harshana Nanayakkara appeared before the Commission to seek permission to represent B.H.I. Saman Kumara, the interdicted EPF senior officer who is involved in the Treasury bond auction on February 27, 2015. The Commission granted Nanayakkara permission to represent Saman Kumara under section 16 of the Commission of Inquiry Act.

The farmers urge authorities to bring relief for them by taking steps to create a viable market for them to sell their produce at a reasonable price.

Ragging rage
CentreStage Productions is gearing up for their most ambitious project yet  the spectacular production of Rag  The Musical, which will run for four performances on November 2, 4 and 5 at the Lionel Wendt Theatre, Colombo.
Rag is a dramatic musical that deals with the topical issue of ragging sensitively and intelligently. The performance has been a crowd-puller in the past, with full houses and standing ovations every night. The show has been featured in the foreign press around the world, as well as by the BBC. The show will be a fund-raiser for our theatre-based humanitarian work conducted through our StageHands Project.
Ragging (or hazing) refers to the humiliating acts that undergraduates or freshers are forced to undergo by their seniors as a form of initiation into an academic institution. These acts are not innocent fun and games, but have scarred students both physically and emotionally, causing them to drop out or in several cases to commit suicide. The show educates students and those in positions of authority on the ills of ragging, and is thus an excellent vehicle for introducing these issues and opening up a forum for discussion. As CentreStage Productions also has a psychosocial component though their StageHands volunteer project, which is funded by the proceeds from their plays, a series of Forum Theatre workshops are planned in selected schools in order build awareness of the issue and promote the production.
Rag is my most passionate project, and Ive been refining it over 20 years! For me, writing the play was sometimes inspiration and sometimes documentation. I have always been passionate about the issue of youth violence and bullying. It is something my University batch (or Ala Gansiya) was able to change in our own peaceful way many years ago. In fact, some of the most unlikely incidents in the play have their roots in reality - especially that moment in the reprise of Power of One when the students spontaneously form a human barrier to stop the fighting. In addition, when one considers some of the major episodes and tragedies within the plot, the script has proven to be uncannily prophetic foretelling events were to take place several years after it was written, noted Jehan Aloysius.
He says that he is especially grateful to his friend and collaborator Avanti Perera, who has over the last ten years, given so generously of her time and talent while performing the music with him. He is also thankful to Deshan Cooray and Eshantha Peiris who have written such complex choral arrangements which have enhanced the show.
The brand new cast is working hard to master the gamut of new skills necessary for this physically and emotionally challenging show. I am so very proud of the fact that all the leads are fresh faces in English theatre, who have not been featured before. My troupe and I are also grateful for the support of the British Council and Mascons who have thus far come to support us in some capacity. It is unfortunate to note however, that major sponsorship for home grown original theatre does not receive the financial support of corporate entities that prefer pre-packaged imports as viable commercial partnerships.
Thus, the theatre Rag  The Musical, just as our many original works over the last 16 years, will utilise Theatre of Poverty techniques which focus on the maximum impact created by the energy and talent of the actors and creative staging, rather than the other elements, Jehan adds.
CentreStage Productions, founded by Jehan, has produced excellent quality theatre productions, which have often sold out even before opening night.
The musical, which is filled with memorable melodies and meaningful lyrics, presents a positive message of non-violence and unity which is relevant to students in all educational institutions.
The show is supported by The British Council, Mascons Ltd, Ambrosia.
The Power of One workshops
CentreStage Productions and our humanitarian arm the StageHands Project plan to conduct a series of workshops with pre-adult and young adult students from educational institutions on the issue of ragging and bullying. This will be a continuation of our Theatre for Social Change projects initiated in 2005. It is open to students between 16 to 22 years. You need to register before August 5.

Red Bull Campus Cricket National semis on July 21
The Red Bull Campus Cricket National Finals 2017 that began on the 3rd July has ended in 4 out of the 22 competing colleges triumphantly booking their place for the semi finals, which is to be held on July 21. Business Management School (BMS) - reigning World Champions 2016, Saegis Campus, Thurstan College and Kothalawala Defense University (KDU) have pulled through the pack to semis.
The 1st quarter finals held the reigning World Champions, BMS against Richmond College, Galle. Richmond failing to adjust to the tight bowling of BMS led by Ranitha Liyanarachchi hiccoughed to a modest 115 before BMS with the help of Supeshala Jayathilakes unbeaten 27, overhauled Richmonds total to win the match by 4 wickets.
Though the target was just 116, BMS batsmen too failed to make it a confident run-chase as they also lost wickets at closer intervals after the 35-run first-wicket stand between Geshan Wimaladharma and Hashan Dumindu. However, when they were tottering at 67 for five in the 13th over, Supeshala Jayathilake pulled things back in their favour with an unbeaten 26-ball 27 to ensure their victory with three overs and four wickets to spare. Amshi de Silva and Thaveesha Abhishek bowled well for Richmond.
Saegis Campus against Lyceum International School looked to be a tight contest from the Group Stages onwards. When Saegis decided to take the first lease, three good knocks by Thikshila de Silva, Oshada Fernando and Lasith Abeyratne helped them reach an imposing 193 from their 20 overs. Chasing an imposing 194 to win, Lyceums got up to their hundred in the 10th over with just four wickets down after openers put on a quick fire 30 from just 20 balls. With No.3 batsman, Sanjeewa Kumaraswami setting the base for a confident run-chase. However, loss of a few wickets following Sanjeewas departure slowed down Lyceums approach towards the end to fall short by 30 runs.
Meanwhile, Thurstan College made their way into the semi finals without a contest as they received a walkover from their quarter final opponents, Ananda College.
KDU completed the semi final lineup eliminating the Foundation of Goodness Academy (FOG) with a 51-run win, which was assisted by a 43-run opening stand in just under 5 overs between Ramith Gunarathne and Ravindu Uyanhewa.
The two semis, Thurstan College vs BMS and Saegis Campus vs KDU will be worked off on July 21 at P Sara Stadium with the finals on the following day at the same venue.

Russia demands immediate return of diplomatic property from US

Russia is demanding the immediate return of diplomatic properties seized by the Obama administration after claims Moscow hacked the US election.
The Kremlin has accused the United States of setting conditions on the return of the compounds in New York and Maryland.
Former president Barack Obama ordered their seizure in December as well as the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats.
Russia has vehemently denied any involvement in election hacking.
Deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov will meet US undersecretary of state Thomas Shannon to try to thrash out a solution on Monday.
His boss, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, was also reported as saying on a visit to Belarus that "anti-Russian feeling" in the United States meant it was not certain that Moscow and Washington could agree on key global issues.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "We consider it absolutely unacceptable to place conditions on the return of diplomatic property, we consider that it must be returned without any conditions and talking."
President Vladimir Putin raised the issue with Donald Trump when they met for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg this month.
Obama said he was ordering the ban due to US intelligence reports of Russian hacking and an alleged influence campaign to sway the US presidential election in Trump's favour.
He said Moscow was using the compounds for "intelligence-related purposes".
The Russian President held off from retaliating at the time and said he would wait to see how Trump reacted after he came into the White House.
However, hopes that Trump will soon act on his campaign pledges to boost relations have faded as any ties to Moscow have become toxic.
The White House has faced a maelstrom of US investigations into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.
Russia is intensifying its threats that it could now retaliate by blocking a country house and a storage facility used by the US Embassy in Moscow.
Lavrov said last week: "If Washington decides not to solve this issue, we will have to take counter actions."
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova complained that the US was also refusing to issue visas for Russian diplomats to replace those expelled.

A simple thanks..!
A few years ago I looked at the papers one morning and saw pics of men and women huddled together, weeping, sobbing, shaking with uncontrollable sorrow; mothers and fathers looking at each other with eyes aghast, shaking their heads in denial, How could this happen they cry out in grief, How could a plane crash take away our dear one from us they scream silently, bodies racked in spasms of grief.
I shudder but go quiet within; even as I weep with them there is a feeling of deep thankfulness; it was just a day before that my own child flew to Europe on an Air-France flight as part of a student exchange program; I look at pictures of those grieving relatives and my heart cries out in thankfulness that my child reached safe!
How easy to forget being thankful for all we take for granted:
We are irritated our child hasnt done well in school, right But give thanks he or she isnt hanging from the end of a rope like whats happening to many kids. We are unhappy with our job, with the distance we have to travel to work, but see yon face of him whos been sacked, who gets into car which he hasnt paid for, enters a house whose loan is so huge, the lift shudders as it takes him up to his flat in the skies, which is already flying away. Give thanks for your secure job.
We look at our ordinary spouses and ogle hunks on the sports page or semi-nude mates many publications provide for our lustful selves, forgetting that such fellows and beauties have egos to be filled and wants to be satiated, till they finally walk away. Thank you for your adoration, but we need to find other worshippers!
I look at the pictures of grief again and my heart cries out in thanks:
Thank you for the scorching sun that even as I get burnt and complain I know I can walk and run outside, not an invalid somewhere!
Thank you for the rains that are upon us that even as I sigh and open the umbrella, know I have a head to protect and not one under a surgeons knife!
Thank you for traffic jams, for as I look at other cars blocking my way, I know Im in the midst of people and not locked away in jail or detention centre in some country that will not tolerate my plain, blunt, candid views!
Thank you for all the things I keep complaining about, that even as I complain, I hope for change, something those grieving relatives cant ever hope for!
Lets not wait for sorrow to realize how we take much for granted, instead start appreciating and giving God thanks for simple things you and I havent been giving thanks for till now, especially those annoying, irritating little stuff that tell us we have a reason to be thankful..!

Spider-Man: Homecoming : A tad tiresome
Many actors have given life to iconic comic book roles like Superman and Spider-Man. This year young actor Tom Holland haves a new twist to Spider-Man as he takes the role back to his teens. 2017s face of the web swinger is much younger than his earlier versions and it gives an interesting look to the series.
Jon Watts Spider-Man: Homecoming sees starstruck teenager Peter Parker rubbing shoulders with the mighty Avengers.
His selfies and video shoots becomes too much for the team including the movies audience to bear. Soon he finds himself yearning for action with Tony Stark aka Iron Man as his mentor.
Starks advice to the energetic youth is to go back to school and wait for his moment of glory. However the impatient youth finds himself in hot water when he goes looking for adventure and things seem to go wrong horribly as he finds himself in the hands of Vulture, a man who poses a real threat to the world due to using high tech machinery.
Funky and upbeat
Unlike its predecessors Spider-Man: Homecoming lacks the superheroic aura. The protagonist is solely concentrating on becoming an A list superhero. Aunt May too has gone through a transformation. She is not the mourning and fragile widow portrayed in the previous films. She is a more modern version of a woman who seems funky and upbeat. Spider-Mans ladylove, Liz, too is not your typical Mary Jane Watson. 2017s version of her is as an attractive African American who unfortunately happens to be Vultures daughter as well.
Though he is not the dashing superhero lookswise Holland manages to carry his role surprisingly well. His eagerness works as well as brings down the attraction towards the movie. On one hand we relate to the teenager who possesses the stereotyped teen dreams. He has to work hard to prove himself to Starks and the public what he is really made of.
Coming of age
On the other hand since he is really set his heart on saving the day, we become tired of his over enthusiasm. This is especially evident in the first few episodes of the film when Parker goofs off with his Spider-Man costume.
Luckily it does not last long as action takes over the screen.
Marvel has been marvelous with most of their previous projects before but what sets Spider-Man: Homecoming apart from the rest if the innocence embodied in the movie.
The coming of age of the protagonist touches the audiences hearts. Though the latest in the Spider-Man series is much smaller in scale it is by no means smaller in spirits.

Sri Lanka to enhance tourism and cultural ties with Kerala
Deputy Tourism Minister Arundika Fernando, who is on a visit to the state, said the Government is actively considering a tie-up with Kerala in the tourism sector. Fernando said Colombos rise as a tourist hotspot did not take a toll on the tourism potential of India or Kerala.
He said both Kerala and Sri Lanka have several common features and Colombo is keen on cooperating with the state in the fields of tourism and cultural exchange. We discussed bilateral cooperation in the tourism sector during talks with New Delhi. But we are also looking for a tie-up with the other Indian states. Besides tourism, we are here to extend an invite to investors to set up businesses in other sectors in Sri Lanka, he said.
Fernando said, tourism is one of the major sources of revenue for the emerald nation, with the tourism sector witnessing rapid growth. Currently, Lankas annual revenue from the tourism sector is pegged at $3 billion and this is expected to jump up to $7 billion by 2020.
The Government also has plans to increase the tourist footfall by 2020. After the Eelam War with the Tamil Tiger rebels (LTTE), the tourism sector in Sri Lanka has witnessed rapid growth. The geographical features have ensured Lankas place as one of the most preferred tourist destinations, he added.
Fernando denied Sri Lanka had emerged as a rival to India on the tourism front. In fact, we are not promoting Sri Lanka tourism alone. People coming to Sri Lanka also prefer to visit India and Maldives. We are promoting tourism of multiple nations. India has always been a key player in Lankas development.
Labour and Trade Unions Minister Ravindra Samaraweera, spoke on Indias contributions in rebuilding his nation. He also dwelt on the cultural exchange between Kerala and Sri Lanka.
Ayurveda is a key attraction for tourists visiting Sri Lanka. However, ayurveda in Sri Lanka is not as well developed as it is in Kerala. Similarly, education is another sector where Lanka can stand to gain from Kerala, he said.

Sri Lanka pull off record chase to beat Zimbabwe

Niroshan Dickwella and Asela Gunaratne guided Sri Lanka to a record 388 target to beat Zimbabwe by four wickets Tuesday in a pulsating end to their one-off Test.
A crucial 121-run sixth-wicket stand between Gunaratne (80 not out) and Dickwella (81) secured Sri Lanka's best-ever run chase.
Sri Lanka's previous best was against South Africa in 2006, when they achieved a 352-run target. Tuesday's chase was also the highest in Asia and fifth best in Tests.
Man-of-the-match Gunaratne anchored the chase to perfection after Dickwella's departure, putting on an unbeaten 67-run partnership with Dilruwan Perera (29 not out) to take Sri Lanka to victory.
The win in Colombo was a boost for new Test captain Dinesh Chandimal and eased Sri Lanka's pain after a shock defeat in the one-day series against the minnows.
"It's always tough when you're batting in the fourth innings but I told the team that they should play their normal game and they played some outstanding innings, especially Dickwella and Asela," Chandimal said.
"It's always challenging as a captain but it's about doing the right things on and off the field," said Chandimal, who took over after Angelo Mathews quit because of the ODI loss.
Zimbabwe skipper Graeme Cremer claimed four wickets with his leg-spin to return overall figures of 9-275 at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
But Gunaratne, who played most of the Test as a batsman after injuring his hamstring in the first innings, tackled the Zimbabwe spinners with ease during his 151-ball stay.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Dickwella rode his luck to reach 81 before being caught behind off left-arm spinner Sean Williams while attemping an audacious reverse sweep.
Dickwella survived a stumping chance from Sikandar Raza's off-spin on 37 and was then dropped by wicketkeeper Regis Chakabva on 63.
The stumping reprieve cost Zimbabwe dearly. It was referred to the third umpire, who ruled him not out despite replays showing his toe was on the crease -- a case where the batsman can be given out.
Earlier, Cremer sent overnight batsman Kusal Mendis trudging back to the pavilion for 66 after Sri Lanka resumed on 170-3.
Cremer struck again with his leg-spin to have Mathews caught and bowled for 25. The visitors scented victory, but it was not to be for the 10th-ranked side.
"Credit to them...but the way the guys fought and got the runs on the board and pushed Sri Lanka till he last day was great," said Cremer.
"The one-day series is a high point for us, we brought that confidence into the Test match and it gave us the belief that we could push the big teams."
For Sri Lanka, veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath also stood out with five wicket hauls in each innings. He got the man of the series award for his overall match figures of 11-249.
Zimbabwe batsman Craig Ervine's 160 in the first innings and allrounder Raza's 127 in the second essay were also notable performances in the match.
Sri Lanka host the number-one ranked India for three Tests, five one day internationals and a single Twenty20 later this month.

Sri Lanka require a further 218 runs and Zimbabwe 7 wickets : Test excitingly poised for thrilling finish
The one-off Test between Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe was poised for an exciting finish on the fifth and final day today after an absorbing fourth day at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Zimbabwe was finally dismissed in their second innings after lunch for 377, which left Sri Lanka with a target of 388 to chase in a minimum of 138 overs for victory. By stumps the game was in the balance with Sri Lanka wiping out 170 of those runs and leaving themselves with a further 218 runs to get on the final day while from Zimbabwes view point they have captured three vital wickets and have 90 overs to capture the remaining seven if they are to record their first Test win over Sri Lanka.
As the game stands both results are possible. At the wickets are Kusal Mendis unbeaten on 60 and former skipper Angelo Mathews on 19. Mendis is a big game player and a sizeable knock is due from him any moment. He suffered from bouts of cramps whenever he attempted the sweep shot and had to be treated twice on the field. Sri Lanka could do with one of his big innings here if they are to chase down this huge target. They would also require Mathews experience in the middle.
Only twice has a team successfully chased down more than 350 in Sri Lanka  Pakistan chasing 377 to win by seven wickets at Pallekele in 2015 and Sri Lanka 352 to beat South Africa by one wicket at the P Sara Oval in 2006.
It seems the pitch has two appearances for when Zimbabwe batted none of the Sri Lankan bowlers could extract much turn or lift from it and batting was made to look easy. But when it came to Sri Lankas turn to bat the ball started to do plenty especially the wrist spin of skipper Graeme Cremer who finished the day with figures of two 67 bowling unchanged 19 overs.
If Zimbabwe are to create history of any sort Cremers right-arm leg-breaks is the key for he managed to get more purchase out of the wicket than any of his other three spinners he used during the Lankan second innings. From the inception of the second innings Zimbabwe have been attacking Sri Lanka with spin which is expected to play a crucial role on a fifth day pitch.
Zimbabwe rode on Sikander Razas maiden hundred to put themselves with a chance of recording a historic maiden Test win over Sri Lanka.
This is the 18th Test match that is being played between the two countries and of the 17 completed Sri Lanka has won 12 and the remaining five have ended in draws.
Razas century gave Zimbabwe a lifeline. His innings of 127 of 205 balls saw them lift themselves from a despairing 23-4 to 306 before he was eventually dismissed attempting to reverse sweep Rangana Herath and getting bowled to give the bowler his 31st five-for in an innings and eighth match bag of ten or more wickets.
Raza who began the day on 97 required just two deliveries to reach his landmark and he celebrated it with a leap in the air and a hug from his partner Malcolm Waller with whom he added a record 144 off 215 balls for the seventh wicket.
Waller made a useful 68 off 98 balls (8 fours) and after his dismissal and that of Raza 17 runs later, Sri Lanka were further frustrated by Cremer and Donald Tiripano in a partnership that produced 55 valuable runs. Cremer missed out on his half century when Herath had him caught off his glove on the sweep for his 11th wicket of the match.

Sri Lankan cleared of charges in 19-year-old rape case

A Sri Lankan national charged with raping a young South Korean woman nearly two decades ago was acquitted by the top court on Tuesday, in the final twist of a long-drawn-out investigation into the cold case.
The Supreme Court upheld the not-guilty rulings by the lower courts on the 51-year-old foreigner, whose identity has been withheld, citing a lack of evidence.
"It is difficult to believe the veracity of their testimonies in light of objectivity and details of the statements," the top court said in the ruling.
The defendant was indicted in 2013 on charges of robbing and raping an 18-year-old college student, only identified by her last name Chung, in 1998. The belated indictment came as the DNA of the defendant, who was arrested for soliciting prostitution to a minor, was found to match that left on Chung's underwear.
Chung was found dead on Oct. 17, 1998, after being hit by a 25-ton dump truck on a highway in Daegu, some 302 kilometers southeast of Seoul. The police had suspected rape as they found her lingerie 30 meters away from the site of the accident, but concluded it was an accidental death.
In the fresh investigation, the prosecutors found that Chung jumped into the road as she ran away from her attackers in fear and had lost sense of direction in the dark.
The prosecutors indicted the Sri Lankan and two other accomplices of the same nationality on counts of special robbery and rape in 2013. It was about the only criminal charge they could lay against them since the statutes of limitation for rape and special rape in Korea are set at five years and 10 years, respectively.
The lower court and appeals court found the defendant not guilty, saying that the evidence was insufficient to prove the charges.
The prosecution managed to call a witness to the stand who testified that the defendant had told him in person about committing the rape. But the appeals court dismissed the testimony citing a lack of credibility.
The Sri Lankan will be extradited to his country as South Korea is bound by law to send back a foreign criminal who's been given a suspended sentence. He was convicted of sexually harassing a woman in 2013 and driving without a license a few years before that.
The two other accomplices in Chung's case were expelled from the country in the early 2000s due to the illegal stay.

Stricter laws to combat drug menace
Measures have already been taken to formulate a new set of stringent laws and regulations through the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol and National Dangerous Drug Control Board since the existing laws and regulations were inadequate to combat the drug menace, Director to the President Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention Samantha Kumara Kithalawaarchchi said.
He was speaking at a media conference at the Government Information Department yesterday. Kithalawaarchchi said that under the existing laws, legal action could be taken against a limited number of recognised drugs. Currently there are various types of drugs prevailing in the market and they come as pills, sprays, ice cubes, etc. But the existing laws are not sufficient to take action against people who sell or use these drugs, he said.
These new varieties of drugs are very popular among schoolchildren since they believe that these drugs have the ability to boost their memory power. Schoolchildren are very innovative and they find various things which have power to intoxicate, he added.
Therefore, the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention has taken measures to make the schoolchildren aware about the danger of taking these drugs and also to change this wrong attitude of children, Kithalawaarchchi added.

Syrian war has killed more than 330,000
LEBANON: More than 330,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict since it started six years ago, around a third of them civilians, a monitor said on Sunday.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it has documented the deaths of 331,765 people across Syria since the conflict erupted in mid-March 2011 with anti-government protests.
Included in the overall death toll are 99,617 civilians, Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP, adding that the figures were for the period between March 15, 2011 and July 15, 2017.
A total of 18,243 children and 11,427 women were among the civilians killed, the Observatory said.
The figures were the latest provided by the Observatory since March when it said 320,000 people, including 96,000 civilians, had been killed.
In its latest report, the Observatory said a total of 116,774 members of the regime forces or regime supporters have been killed in Syria since the conflict began.
Of those, it said 61,808 were soldiers and 1,408 were members of the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, an Iran-backed regime ally.
Also killed in Syria since the conflict erupted were 57,000 rebels, including from the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, an Arab-Kurdish alliance.
In addition, more than 58,000 jihadists, namely from the Islamic State group and Al-Qaedas former Syria affiliate, were killed, said the Observatory, noting that the figure also includes foreign extremists.
The conflict broke out with peaceful anti-government protests but quickly turned into a fully fledged war involving a multitude of local, regional and foreign powers.
The brutal conflict has destroyed much of the countrys infrastructure and displaced millions of people, more than half of Syrias population. - AFP

Telecommunications levy to be reduced

National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr Harsha de Silva implied today that the Government intends the relaxing of telecommunication levy on internet services shortly.
The Government came under heavy criticism in the recent past over increasing tax on internet data. However, you will hear good news with regard to data tax in the next couple of days from the higher political authorities in the Government. It will be a positive step taken by the Government to encourage active online participation of youth, de Silva said.
The Deputy Minister was addressing an event at the Lakshman Kadirgarmar Institute to mark the launch of www.iVoice.lk,an online platformfor youth to discuss social issues and drive innovative solutions.
The Deputy Minister, pointing out that the social media is a double edged sword, invited the youth to use it responsibly to participate in development and have meaningful engagements.
The social media played a vital role in bringing this Government into power, and in the same way they could send this Government home. We must understand this reality. Rather than licensing, closing or blocking them, the Government must rectify its own faults and move forward. Politicians must have a backbone do so, he opined.
The Deputy Minister however stressed that the social media should not be used to insult anybody with doctored pictures, mudslinging posts or videos. Such posts reflect your level of discipline, he added.
De Silva also highlighted the importance of youth voting at elections, adding that criticism in social media platforms alone would not help to see the changes they want.
Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum Chairperson Prof Padmasiri Wanigasundera and United Nations Population Fund Country Representative Ritsu Nacken also addressed the gathering.
Social media activists Nadie Wasalamudaliarachchi, Gopiharan Perinpam and Himal Kotalawala conducted the panel discussion on How can social media help us build a better Sri Lanka attended by over 100 young social media users across the country.

Although defeated elements sling mud at the Police Department for want of a cheap topic to gain publicity, terrorism will never raise its head again in the North and East due to the reconciliation programme implemented by the President and the Prime Minister, IGP Pujith Jayasundera said.
Participating in a discussion programme relayed over the SLBC Rajatata service, the IGP said that even though the bed rock of terrorism in the country was totally defeated, its international network and diaspora could not be defeated until the demands of the Tamils were met and they were given equal status as other citizens.
He said these changes could not be made overnight. It needed time for systematic implementation. He said the police had been at the receiving end during the 1971 insurrection and the 1979 period. However, the prime objective of the Police was to safeguard peace and freedom for all people. He said the police service was always prepared to accept constructive criticism and act accordingly.
Each and every member in the police service should discharge their duties with a human touch devoid of any prejudice.
Senior DIG Jagath Abeysirigunawardena, DIG Padmalal Sandungahawatta and SSP Ravi Pieris were also present on the occasion.
Earlier in the morning, the IGP paid homage at the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura and received the blessings of the Maha Sangha.

Tiger Shroff will step into the shoes of Sylvester Stallone for the Indian remake of Rambo, and the actor says it would be cool to have the Hollywood star in the film.
Rambo remake will be directed by Siddharth Anand, who had previously helmed Hrithik Roshan starrer Bang Bang.
Tiger is aware that it is a big role and says he might also meet Stallone for the film.
"'Rambo' remake is one of my most exciting projects lined up. I am very scared and excited. Scared because I have big shoes to fill and excited because it is something up my alley and I really want to go all out for the film. I am definitely planning to meet him (Stallone), that's in the pipeline," Tiger told PTI.
In an Instagram post earlier, Stallone, 70, had written that he was confident that Tiger would do a good job and he will put his heart and soul into it.
When asked if there are plans to rope in Stallone for a guest appearance, Tiger says, "That would be so cool to do. I think the makers definitely have something special planned. But let's see if that is on the cards or not."

The Colombo High Court yesterday re-issued summons on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appear before Colombo High Court on December 4, to testify in the case filed against UNP former General Secretary Tissa Attanayake for allegedly displaying a fraudulent document to the media during the last presidential election for the purpose of affecting the result of then Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena.
When the came up before High Court Judge Wikum Kaluarachchi, Presidents Counsel Nissanka Nanayakkara, appearing for President and Prime Minister, the key witnesses in the case, informed Court that his clients were not appearing in Court since they have to perform unavoidable official duties.
Accordingly, the case was put off for trial on a day-to-day basis commencing from December 4 to December 12.
The rest of the witnesses from witness number three to fifteen were advised to appear in Court on next trial date. Meanwhile, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim appeared in Court as the thirteenth witness in the case he was represented by counsel Niroshan Perera.

Unabated  climate  change  can have devastating  consequences in Asia Pacific
Unabated climate change would bring devastating consequences to countries in Asia and the Pacific, which could severely affect their future growth, reverse current development gains, and degrade quality of life, according to a report produced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).
Under a business-as-usual scenario, a 6 degree Celsius temperature increase is projected over the Asian landmass by the end of the century.
Some countries in the region could experience significantly hotter climates, with temperature increases in Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and the northwest part of the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) projected to reach 8 degree Celsius, according to the report, titled 'A Region at Risk: The Human Dimensions of Climate Change in Asia and the Pacific'.
These increases in temperature would lead to drastic changes in the regions weather system, agriculture and fisheries sectors, land and marine biodiversity, domestic and regional security, trade, urban development, migration, and health.
Such a scenario may even pose an existential threat to some countries in the region and crush any hope of achieving sustainable and inclusive development.
The global climate crisis is arguably the biggest challenge human civilization faces in the 21st century, with the Asia and Pacific region at the heart of it all, said Bambang Susantono, ADB Vice President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development. Home to two-thirds of the worlds poor and regarded as one of the most vulnerable region to climate change, countries in Asia and the Pacific are at the highest risk of plummeting into deeper poverty - and disaster - if mitigation and adaptation efforts are not quickly and strongly implemented.
"The Asian countries hold Earth's future in their hands. If they choose to protect themselves against dangerous climate change, they will help to save the entire planet, said Professor Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, PIK Director. "The challenge is twofold. On the one hand, Asian greenhouse-gas emissions have to be reduced in a way that the global community can limit planetary warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed in Paris 2015. Yet even adapting to 1.5 degrees Celsius temperature rise is a major task."
"So, on the other hand, Asian countries have to find strategies for ensuring prosperity and security under unavoidable climate change within a healthy global development. But note that leading the clean industrial revolution will provide Asia with unprecedented economic opportunities. And exploring the best strategies to absorb the shocks of environmental change will make Asia a crucial actor in 21st-century multilateralism."
More intense typhoons and tropical cyclones are expected to hit Asia and the Pacific with rising global mean temperatures. Under a business-as-usual scenario, annual precipitation is expected to increase by up to 50% over most land areas in the region, although countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan may experience a decline in rainfall by 20-50%.
Coastal and low-lying areas in the region will be at an increased risk of flooding. Nineteen of the 25 cities most exposed to a one-meter sea-level rise are located in the region, 7 of which are in the Philippines alone.
Indonesia, however, will be the most affected country in the region by coastal flooding with approximately 5.9 million people expected to be affected every year until 2100.
Increased vulnerability to flooding and other disasters will significantly impact the region - and the world - economically. Global flood losses are expected to increase to US$52 billion per year by 2050 from US$6 billion in 2005.
Moreover, 13 of the top 20 cities with the largest growth of annual flood losses from 2005-2050 are in Asia and the Pacific: Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Zhanjiang, and Xiamen (PRC); Mumbai, Chennai-Madras, Surat, and Kolkata (India); Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam); Jakarta (Indonesia); Bangkok (Thailand); and Nagoya (Japan).
Climate change will also make food production in the region more difficult and production costs higher.
In some countries of Southeast Asia, rice yields could decline by up to 50% by 2100 if no adaptation efforts are made. Almost all crops in Uzbekistan, meanwhile, are projected to decrease by 20-50% by 2050 even in a 2 degree Celsius temperature increase (Paris Agreement scenario).
Food shortages could increase the number of malnourished children in South Asia by 7 million, as import costs will likely increase in the subregion to US$15 billion per year compared to US$2 billion by 2050.
Marine ecosystems, particularly in the Western Pacific, will be in serious danger by 2100. All coral reef systems in the subregion will collapse due to mass coral bleaching if global warming increases by 4 degree Celsius (global business-as-usual scenario). Even with a 1.5 degree Celsius temperature increase, 89% of coral reefs are expected to suffer from serious bleaching, severely affecting reef-related fisheries and tourism in Southeast Asia.
Climate change also poses a significant risk to health in Asia and the Pacific. Already, 3.3 million people die every year due to the harmful effects of outdoor air pollution, with the PRC, India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh being the top four countries experiencing such deaths.
In addition, heat-related deaths in the region among the elderly are expected to increase by about 52,000 cases by 2050 due to climate change, according to data from the World Health Organization.
Deaths related to vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue may also increase.
A business-as-usual approach to climate change could also disrupt functioning ecosystem services, prompting mass migration - mostly to urban areas - that could make cities more crowded and overwhelm available social services.
Moreover, a warmer climate for the region could endanger energy supply. Climate change can exacerbate energy insecurity through continued reliance on unsustainable fossil fuels, reduced capacities of thermal power plants due to a scarcity of cooling water, and intermittent performance of hydropower plants as a result of uncertain water discharges, among other factors.
Energy insecurity could lead to conflicts as countries compete for limited energy supply.
To mitigate the impact of climate change, the report highlights the importance of implementing the commitments laid out in the Paris Agreement.
These include public and private investments focused on the rapid decarbonization of the Asian economy as well as the implementation of adaptation measures to protect the regions most vulnerable populations.
Climate mitigation and adaptation efforts should also be mainstreamed into macro-level regional development strategies and micro-level project planning in all sectors, in addition to the ongoing renewable energy and technology innovation efforts in urban infrastructure and transport.
The region has both the capacity and weight of influence to move towards sustainable development pathways, curb global emissions, and promote adaptation, the report concludes.
The ADB approved a record $3.7 billion in climate financing in 2016 and has committed to further scale up its investments to $6 billion by 2020.
The ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.
Established in 1966, ADB is celebrating 50 years of development partnership in the region. It is owned by 67 members - 48 from the region. In 2016, ADB assistance totaled US$31.7 billion, including US$14 billion in cofinancing.

We need to negotiate Cremer to win  Dimuth
Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne said that Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer who is the only wrist spinner in their line-up would pose a threat to Sri Lanka winning the one-off Test match at the R Premadasa Stadium.
Cremer is a different bowler compared to the rest. He is bowling on good areas and turning well. Other than that, I dont think there will be a much of a threat from the other bowlers, said Karunaratne. Other than that ball from Sean Williams (off which Karunaratne got bowled) I had no trouble. I was always getting the single I wanted. There will the odd ball turning but Cremer is a threat. He is bowling well.
We cant go for survival. Well have to play shots but well have to be smart. If one batsman gets set against Cremer, runs will flow. Then they will be under pressure and theyll have to spread out the field. Well have to put them under pressure.
What Sean is doing is that he pegs the batsman down and forces him to commit a mistake against Cremer. Other than those two, I dont think there will be such a big threat. But the reality is that those two cannot keep bowling right throughout the day. So well see how the wicket behaves and set a plan.
Karunaratne was confident that Sri Lanka has a good chance of knocking the runs off.
I do believe that we can make it. We have already scored 170 for three wickets and we need only 218 more. On the other hand, we batted when the ball was hard but now that hardness is gone. All what they have now is the support from that rough. Angie (Angelo Mathews) and Kusal (Mendis) are set now. If those two guys keep on batting for an hour or more tomorrow morning they can get set again. If that happens, I dont think its easy to get them out unless we do something silly, said Karunaratne.
Zimbabwe are bowling on the leg side with more fielders. So we need to have a plan to change that field may be play a reverse sweep. If we do that, we will be able to put some runs on the board quickly. If we go to survive, were losing the opportunity to win the match. We need to go on a positive mind to score 218 runs and win the game. Once we get closer, then we can take a call on it, whether to go for the target or go for a draw. But the most important thing is to have wickets in hand. So tomorrows first session is very crucial for us, he said.  ST

Words fit for a king
Tea is essentially the story of Sri Lanka. Despite its recent history of not more than 200 years, the crop shaped the economy of this little isle.
www.hermanteas.com, however, remembers the moments when politics changed the course of the tea industry.
. and in 1974 with the nationalisation of British plantations 1000 acres were taken over by the government and 1000 acres was lost by predecessor (who was the President of the Suicide club at that time, an informal association of gamblers) on the roll of the dice.
Herman Gunaratne, the sole proprietor of www.hermanteas.com as well as Handunugoda estate, finds relaxation in writing.
When I feel that some issues with which I am familiar need to be known I write. I get inspiration from no one. Writing comes easy for me because I do not complicate writing with inspirational figures.
Gunaratne cares much about readability. Anything that is readable, he would not reject. If he cannot manage to journey beyond the first few pages, he would just leave the book aside.
I just reject any author I have to labour to read, says he who loves Fredrick Forsythe, Jeffrey Archer and P G Wodehouse.
Herman counts 43 years experience as a plantation manager, his career culminating with his appointment as regional manager of the Nuwara Eliya region in charge of Sri Lankas best tea lands. He was thereafter appointed as the general manager of the Mahaweli Development Scheme He is the author of three earlier books, The Plantation Raj, For a Sovereign State, Tortured Island and The Suicide Club. He runs his own plantation and tea factory and is also developing the only private tea museum in the world. The Suicide Club was shortlisted for the 2010 Gratiaen Prize.
His latest work titled as Gods Secret Agent and subtitled as Battle Against Dark Forces was launched recently at Misissa Hills, a boutique hotel in Mirissa.
Inquired by Ashok Ferry at the launch whether the book was purely a work of fiction, Herman Gunaratne responded in the negative. The work centres around true events, Gunaratne asserted. He recalled his own experiences with a Christian who went by the name of Nissanka Wimalasuriya who executed a number of miracles such as healing physical and mental ailments. He would also offer a solution to your career problem, Gunaratne went on to say. The book was written as a way of tribute to that saintly figure known to Gunaratne for decades.
The events outlined in this book have enlightened me to the world I never knew. It sometimes defies belief, but I already knew that when I wrote it. I do hope however it brings the spotlight on witchcraft which is the downfall of this mighty nation, Gunaratne explained.
Adds he: None has criticised me. I follow John Gays famous words. Fools may scorn not envy raise because envy is a form of praise.
Looking back, does he wish if he could edit his first book His answer is simple: No I regret nothing I have done.
Gratiaen shortlisted author has this comment about the local literary awards: Some winners of awards have not sold more than 300 books. They do a complete disservice to Michael Ondaatje but he seems to go along with this. In Sri Lanka, nothing changes. However, my literary taste does not come anywhere near the levels of sophistication of these judges.
Anyway, he is not much passionate about the award-winning books. He reads only readable books by any author.
Herman is now a planter who plants virgin white tea which is the most expensive kind of tea in the world. Writing is his past time activity.
I work 13- 14 hours a day. That is what I love, hard work.
His website offers an exquisite description to the white tea.
An ancient Chinese tradition lost in the sands of time for over 4000 years, where the Chinese Emperor employed virgins wearing soft silky gloves to cut the tea leaves with gold scissors into a golden bowl. The leaves, with the help of the divine wind, were dried naturally until ready to store. It was a drink exclusively served in the Imperial court and was, even then, considered particularly beneficial to health. Virgin White Tea is the rarest type of white tea, completely untouched by humans from the tea bush to production and until it reaches the lips of the consumer. This tea is Rich with antioxidants and is passionately handcrafted for a unique tea experience.
Excerpts from Gods Secret Agent
These machines were extremely sensitive to the tropics and used to breakdown quite often. Nissanka was almost indispensable and had to stand by for all major operations. He was called upon to travel widely to all the hospitals in the country as there were frequent breakdowns of electro medical equipment due to misuse and lack of maintenance. He had only to go near a machine and  Hey prestos got it working again. It was almost a gift from God.
The Doctors recognized his ability and became very close friends with him He was to help many of them, but let me come to the story in sequence!
He was the most accomplished musician I have known. Was the leader of a band that played all the classical music and the old time favorites. Nissanka could play to perfection the violin, the guitar, piano, organ, mouth organ and the accordion. He could coax out of these instruments the most melodious and lilting music. He was eagerly sought after for parties and dances.
He was once following an electro mechanical course in Germany, where he had no friends at all. He was quite depressed walking about in cold Germany aimlessly and alone. He heard the sounds of an accordion and some raucous German Singing from within a bar. This was irresistible to him! He walked with some trepidation into the Bar. It was an all Caucasian bar and they looked at this tall brown skinned man with no signs of recognition or acknowledgement. He ordered a beer and the bartender reluctantly served him. Nissanka nursing his beer watched the passing scene with keen interest. The German revellers did not even glance at him. It was al most as if he did not exist!
They were singing to the melody of the most expensive accordion in the music market. To Nissanka however they were torturing the instrument .He waited for a while hoping that another accordionist would take over and do justice to the accordion. This was not to be. The same man kept on and on. The musician in Nissanka revolted against this assault.
This was too much for him to take. After fortifying himself with another beer, he summoned up the courage to walk up to the musician. He is soft spoken at all times, and he made a request to the accordion player to give him the opportunity to play.
