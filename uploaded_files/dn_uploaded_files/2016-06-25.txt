Sportswear giant recalls skimpy Tennis dresses
Nike have recalled the tennis dresses due to be used by their female players at Wimbledon after complaints that the skimpy outfits reveal too much flesh.
The manufacturers asked those who wear their apparel  at least 20 players in the main women's draw  to send them back for alterations days ahead of The Championships.
Players complained that the 75 Nike Premier Slam dress flies up above the waistline and hampers their play.
In this week's qualifying event at Roehampton, GB prospect Katie Boulter, 19, wore a belt improvised from a hairband to keep her dress in place. Czech Lucie Hradecka, 31, wore knee-length leggings underneath.
Wimbledon passed the design because it complies with their white kit rules.
Nike told their players to bring the dresses to their rented house close to the All England Club for alterations.
An email from its sports marketing team sent to players and their representatives, seen by Sportsmail, says: We need to make a small change to your dresses per Wimbledon rules. Could you please bring them by the Nike Wimbledon House.
In thick, underlined type there then follows the message this is VERY important'.
Eugenie Bouchard and Laura Robson are among the stars expected to have their dresses lengthened by the sportswear firm.
Wimbledon has a famously strict all-white dress code which states that common standards of decency are required at all times'.
Serena Williams, the company's highest profile endorsee in the event, will wear a slightly adapted version of the outfit, the Nike Women's Premier Wimbledon Serena SW19 Dress'.
The 100 dress is more structured and features a nipped in waist and a higher neckline.
An All England Club spokesman described it as a matter for Nike.
We approved it because it fully complies with our colour regulations, he said.
Nike declined to comment when approached.

Tyson Fury reminds me of Adolf Hitler, says Wladimir Klitschko
Wladimir Klitschko, the first gentleman of the ring, has taken a giant step out of character by likening Tyson Fury to Adolf Hitler.
He also described the Englishman who ended his decade-long reign as world heavyweight champion as a mentally-ill imbecile. It was not so much a rant as his measured opinion of Fury as anti-Semitic, homophobic and sexist which Klitschko delivered in his Tyrolean mountain lair where he is preparing for their July 9 rematch.
The 40-year-old Ukrainian vows to shut Fury down by beating him in his home town of Manchester
But should he fail to reclaim his crown from the Gipsy King he urges the world authorities to ban Fury from boxing.
Klitschko endured without complaint all Furys insults and antics before their first fight in Dusseldorf. He tempered his opinions of Furys offensive views  which the Briton says are religion-based.
It is Furys remarks about Jews which he feels compelled to denounce in the strongest imaginable terms.
Klitschko says: I was in shock at his statements about women and the gay community. But when he got to the Jewish people he sounded like Hitler. I am fighting a guy who cant hold his mouth. He is an imbecile. Seriously. We have an imbecile as world heavyweight champion.
In this crazy world we live in we dont need someone using this great stage to bring hate to the Jewish people. I cannot accept that. We are one society.
It puts our sport in the wrong spot. As champion he represents not only himself but so many other people, including all the fans of boxing.
When I beat him I will not only be doing Klitschko fans and boxing fans in general a favour but also the British fans.
We cannot have a champion who creates the friction which generates hate. After women, gays and Jewish people, what next
He is probably mentally sick and either he needs to be shut up in the ring or suspended. Fears have been expressed for the post-boxing well-being of Fury, who tells of his own deep depressions and veers between delight at being world champion and despair at the thought of fighting again.
No sympathy from Klitschko, who says scornfully: I am not buying any of that BS spewing out of his mouth. It is absolute, total nonsense. And we know it.
Fury, despite having apologised for his more outrageous comments, still has many critics. But the voice of Klitschko, with his long-standing reputation for courtesy and restraint outside the ring, will be among those heard most loudly.
Nor does he subscribe to Furys view that Anthony Joshua, his fellow English holder of a world heavyweight title, is a paper champion.
Joshua picked up the IBF belt stripped from Fury days after he relieved Klitschko of his several titles. Klitschko says: I did not get what the IBF were doing with one of the belts I had held so long. But am I angry about it now No. Im happy for Joshua.
As Joshua prepares for his first championship defence  against Dominic Breazeale in Londons O2 Arena on Saturday night  Klitschko reveals: I tweeted him when he won the title. I said, Welcome to the world of challenges.
Thats what it means to be world champion. But its good for boxing to have a young champion. Its exciting for him and the sport.
Will the two of them meet in a unification fight if Klitschko gains his revenge over Fury
Klitschko says: You never know what happens in the future. Nor can I think about it. My mind is entirely focused on shutting down Tyson Fury.

Litro Gas co-sponsors sixth Cavalry Supercross
Litro Gas stepped up as a co-sponsor for the Cavalry Supercross which concluded recently at Pangolla, Kurunegala.
Organized by the Sri Lanka Armoured Crops (SLAC) in collaboration with Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Riders (SLARDAR), the racing event was held on 12th June with the participation of highly experienced riders and drivers who showcased their skills through many events on the track which was constructed as per international standards.
The Cavalry Supercross this year facilitated ninety nine riders and seventy five drivers, including those from other countries, and featured 12 cars and 12 bikes events in total.
The event is a brain child of Brig. IndunilRanasinghe of the Sri Lanka Armoured Corps. It all began during 2010 with a primary motive of raising funds to provide welfare facilities to immediate family members of officers and men who were killed or maimed in battles.
We are delighted to have been a sponsor for the most splendid and glamorous event in the racing arena of Sri Lanka. It has turned into a platform where local riders and drivers can showcase their talent and take it up to a global stage.
We hope to continue sponsoring similar initiatives in the future, said Mr. ChamindaEdiriwickrama, Director- Sales and Marketing of LitroGas Lanka Limited.
Cavalry Supercross has helped the army build necessary infrastructure within the camps such as housing, working environments, recreational facilities, medical, billets and dining facilities.
It has also to-date helped construct 18 houses, 3 holiday bungalows, fund welfare projects or training centre, purchase meds and essentials, contribute to armys brave heart and virudaru projects.

School cricket standards have dropped says Amal Dalugoda
Former Ananda College and CCC cricketer Amal Dalugoda, a resident of UK is of the opinion that Sri Lanka schools cricket standards has fallen from what it was in the
Amal Dalugoda
In the nineties decade at least 4-5 skilled players represented their school teams but at present they dont produce like that, observed Dalugoda who was in Sri Lanka with the Manchester University cricket team of which he is the coach.
Manchester University played several matches against NCC, Moors, Galle CC, Sri Lanka Army and Colts during the tour.
Dalugoda an old boy of Ananda College represented Colombo Cricket Club for ten years in the nineties. He was a talented all-rounder who bowled left-arm leg-spin. Since 2000 he represented many cricket clubs in England and in 2006 he gained permanent residence there.
The selection committee at the time did not consider me because they saw only one side of the coin. At that time I was a forerunner as a left-arm leg- spinner, but I was not given a chance. Thats why I decided to leave for England to upgrade my talent and look for a job, said Dalugoda. In the past years I played cricket at professional level, after that I was appointed as coach of Bolton District. In 2006, Manchester University invited me to coach their team. There were only two teams at that time and today it has increased to seven. We are now playing in the third division of the Inter- University tournament, he stated. Our endeavour is to bring the team to Sri Lanka and give them the opportunity to experience playing under subcontinent conditions and pitches so that we can use it to gain promotion to the Inter-University second division, he further said.
Amal is residing in England with his wife and five children.

Rushan Jaleel Trinity's new Cricket Head Coach
Up and coming coach Rushan Jaleel, a former captain, who played a key role for Trinity College has taken over as the overall head coach for strategic planning, development and implementation of cricket for his alma mater. Last season's coach Kavinda Jayasuriya will continue as the head coach of the senior side, and the two senior players eyeing for the captaincy are Hasitha Boyagoda and Shanmuganathan Shanogeeth.
Rushan born October 7, 1990 was a right-arm off-spinner and right-handed bat. He played for Sri Lanka under 19 and for Ragama CC. He represented his school for five years and enjoyed his cricket. His worthy contribution towards his school was capturing over 125 wickets and also wielding the willow with great success. The turning point in his career was when he changed his bowling style, from fast bowler to spin on the advice of his junior coach Julian Arnolda, a product of St. Sylvesters College and Sampath Perera who polished his cricket and within a very short period transformed him into an impressive cricketer. He won colours and Lion for cricket.
Sevens rugby on July 30-31
The Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union will organize a National Rugby 7's tournament in Kandy on July 30 and 31 at the Nittawela rugby stadium, where t date eight teams have confirmed their willingness to play.
Some the clubs who are expected to take the field are Kandy SC, CR and FC, CH and FC, Havelock SC, Police SC, Army SC, Navy SC and Air Force Sb. These teams are expected to field a few overseas players.
Why arent ruggerites taking to refereeing
In Kandy, according to statistics there are top rugby players retiring from the game but shying away from contributing towards the upliftment of it by becoming rugby referees with their knowledge and experience. In the good old days it was top players who after retirement took to the whistle and kept the game going. This season at most of the school matches there have been unwanted incidents probably because there are no properly qualified people to handle the whistle. In most instances players and spectators have abused and threatened to assault referees or the linesmen, due to poor refereeing. Some of the great players who after giving up the game took to refereeing that come to mind are Col. Bertie Dias, Ashey Cader, Miles Christofelsz, Malcolm Wright, John Banks, Mohamed Azain, C.H. Seneviratne, Mohan Sahayam, Harry Gunatilake, Gamini Fernando, Col. C.S. Fernando, Lt.Gen. Denzil Kobekkaduwa, Anton Benedict, Ana Saranapala, Nimal Lewke, Tony Amith, Daya Jayasundera, Frank Hubert, S.W. Chang, A.R,M.A. Moosa and Bently Barsenbach. There was also a top referee who never played the game in Darley Ingleton who blew in 1960s and mid 1970s. Later we had Dilroy Fernando one of the most qualified of the present era, Anura Jayasekara, Nizam Jamaldeen, Anil Jayasinghe, Orville Fernando, Wimal Senanayake, Roshan Deen, Asela de Silva, Metha Abeygunawardene, Shamlath Fernando and Sanjeewa Saranapala who were much sought after.
Cricket: Sydney Masters vs Kandy Veterans
A 30-over cricket match will be played at the Pallekelle Stadium on August 11 with players above 50 years between Sydney Masters and Kandy Veterans. The Sydney Master team will comprise mostly of Sri Lankans. Kandy Veterans ream will comprise of cricketers from Kandy who are not involved in coaching and umpiring.
Havies center scrums up the hills
Last season's Havelock Sports Club center Dhanushka Ranjan has crossed over to the Kandy Sports Club and if he performs well at practices may get the chance to play for the defending champion club when the inter-club season kicks off at the end of October. Kandy SC are blessed with some top class ruggerites in the country.
Shame on Kandy schools
Though it was another exciting and history-making season for schools rugby, it was a shame for schools in Kandy that none of them were able to hit the top and win a trophy. Trinity and St. Anthonys played in the Cup, St. Sylvesters and Vidyartha played in the Bowl, Kingswood and Dharmaraja in the Plate. All schools, old boys and their rugby wings gave their best support for the game and all schools had sponsors. Every school had coaches for every department, forwards, scrum halves, backs, goal kicking and fitness training. Is it the coaches who failed to deliver and get the best of the teams Most of the schools were not happy with the manner in which matches were officiated. Match officials are responsible for enforcing the laws of the game during a match and imposing sanctions on individuals who do not follow the rules. Every match is under the control of match officials who consist of the referee and two touch judges or assistant referees. Sad to say Trinity College is not taking part in the inter-school knockouts, and in their place St Anthonys College will come in. Another sad affair is that the Rajans ended their season on a bad note.
Kandys Ransilu does well at Asian power lifting
The Asian power lifting championships was held in Udaipur India, where 16 countries took part with 250 participants. Former Kingswoodian Ransilu Jayathilake won the first ever medal in the event, and managed to set three records in the 120 kg category, squat 270 kg, bench press 150 kg, dead lifts 305kg, with an overall total of 735 kg. He has qualified to represent the country at the world championships in USA in November.
Two Kandy school products excel
Two Kandy school products Sachith Pathirana and Niroshan Dickwella, who both learnt their cricket at Trinity College, left for England with the Sri Lanka A cricket team on a month long tour. Sachith is a good all-rounder and Niroshan a wicket keeper/batsman.
Trinity U-15 A team enters second round
Trinity College under 15 A side with one outright win, two first innings wins and three no decisions have entered the second round. Thanks to the efforts of skipper Jeff Wijesinghe who has two half centuries and Nagitha Wijesundara with 21 wickets. Others who did well are Umair Rains, Kevin Perera, in batting, Nakitha Wijesundara, Deemantha Bandara, Kavidu Dias, Gagana Udakotuwage in bowling and all-rounders Abishek Anandakumara, Agbo Amarasinghe, Pamith Balasooriya and Shane Gunathilake. They are coached by L.H. Sunil and Chandima Abeykoon.

Qualifier Puig extends dream Eastbourne run
EASTBOURNE, THURSDAY: Qualifier Monica Puig had to dig deep to extend her fairytale run in Eastbourne, battling past Kristina Mladenovic to move into the semi-finals of the Wimbledon warm-up event on Thursday.
Shortly after the 43rd-ranked Puerto Rican booked her place, top seed and 2008 champion Agnieszka Radwanska was caught out by rain moving into Britain's south coast from France.
Radwanska was a set up against 12th seed Dominika Cibulkova, 6-4, 3-2, when their quarter-final was forced off court at Devonshire Park for a second time in the evening.
Czech 10th seed Karolina Pliskova was leading Russia's Elena Vesnina, the 2013 champion, 4-0. British 11th seed and Eastbourne local Johanna Konta never got onto court against Russian Ekaterina Makarova.
Puig, who spent nearly three hours in defeating French Open doubles champion Mladenovic 7-6 (8/6), 4-6, 6-3, said that mental strength was vital.
The sports psychology part, my team takes care of. My coach and everybody on my team tries to get me mentally prepared for every single type of situation that I'm going to encounter on the court, she said.
The strength comes from within, but I think it just gets stronger due to the experience I have had in the past. I've had several matches where I have been the softer one and I have caved to the pressure.
But now I have some of these matches under my belt (from difficult situations) and I have been able to pull it out.
Puig also made it to the Sydney final in January from a qualifying start, facing two-time grand slam winner Svetlana Kuznetsova in the title match. She ran out of steam and lost the final 6-0, 6-2.
Puig on Thursday survived nine double-faults and 10 aces from her opponent in a see-saw tear-up on the grass.
We're both putting so much pressure on each other's serves. It was basically about me staying focused and doing what I had to do, which is be as aggressive as I could and just keep my head together, said Puig.

Seven confirm places for Rio Games
Sri Lanka will field a contingent of around ten members for the forthcoming summer Olympic Games to be held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in August.
Already, three athletes have gained qualifying standards. They will be joined by two swimmers, a shooter and a badminton player. However the exact strength of the Sri Lankan contingent for the XXXIst Summer Olympic Games in Rio will be known after the International Olympic Committee deadline ends on July 4.
Secretary General of the National Olympic Committee of Sri Lanka (NOC), Maxwell de Silva said, So far, three athletes have gained qualifying standards. Two swimmers, a shooter and a badminton player too have been included in the contingent. There is a possibility of golfer Mithun Perera also booking a place, subject to his performance at the ongoing tournaments before the IOC deadline.
AnuradhaIndrajithCooray
Veteran marathon runners Anuradha Indrajith Cooray and Geethani Rajasekera were among the first to book their places after they gained qualifying standards in the mens and womens marathon respectively last year. The duo also represented Sri Lanka at last years IAAF World Championships in Beijing, China.
In fact, this will be the third time that London-based Cooray will be representing Sri Lanka at an Olympic Games, having done so at Athens 2004 and London 2012. Susanthika Jayasinghe, the womens 200m silver medalist at 2000 Games in Sydney, holds the record for most Olympic Games appearances by an Lankan athlete, having made it to the 1996, 2000, 2004 and 2008 Games although she did not run in one of them due to an injury.
The 38-year-old long distance veteran was the first Lankan to assure a place at the Rio Games when he clocked two hours, 13 minutes and 47 seconds at last years London Marathon, thus bettering the mens marathon Olympic qualifying time of 2:17.00. Geethani bettered her own Sri Lankan mark in the womens marathon when she clocked two hours, 40 minutes and 7 seconds to finish fifth in the Asian Marathon last year. Her performance enabled the woman soldier to better her own previous Sri Lanka record of 2:47.55 and become the first Sri Lankan woman ever to compete at an Olympic marathon.
Airman Sumedha Ranasinghe, a product of Kegalle MV, is the other athlete who has qualified to compete in Rio. The ace mens javelin thrower cleared a distance of 83.04m at the final South Asian Games selection trial at the Diyagama Mahinda Rajapaksa Sports Complex, slightly bettering the Olympic qualifying distance of 83.00m.

US-born Mathew Abeysinghe is the sole mens simmer in the Lankan contingent. He won a record seven gold medals - two silvers and a bronze to make it a record total of ten medals, at the last South Asian Games held in Guwahati, India early this year.

Chandimal and Tharanga carry Sri Lanka to 254/7
BIRMINGHAM: Brilliant fielding and accurate bowling on a good batting pitch by England kept Sri Lanka down to a total of 254 for seven wickets after they won the toss and decided to bat first in the second One-Day International played at Edgbaston here on Friday.
England accounted for two important run outs both involving Jason Roy who got rid of the dangerous looking Kusal Perera for 37 with a direct hit and top scorer Dinesh Chandimal for 52.
Sri Lankas innings was built around an 82-run partnership for the fourth wicket between Chandimal and his captain Angelo Mathews who contributed a valuable 44 batting with a dodgy hamstring injury.
Although Mathews declared himself fit it was quite evident the way he batted that he was clearly uncomfortable in his movements. But credit to him for putting up a brave front.
England never allowed the Lankan top order batsmen to forge any noteworthy partnerships other than the one involving Mathews and Chandimal as they kept chipping away at the batting.
Seekkuge Prasanna on this occasion failed to produce his usual cameo innings when he was dismissed for two when David Willey pulled off a stunning catch behind the bowler as the batsman took the aerial route but failed to get the distance.
Upul Tharanga and Suraj Randiv gave an extra impetus towards the end of the innings with a partnership of 63 off 56 balls that got them over the 250-mark.
Tharanga playing with all his experience of 184 ODIs scored his first half century for three years remaining unbeaten on 53 scored off 49 balls with one six and five fours, while Randiv who gave him good support was 26 not out off 27 balls.
Sri Lanka went for an additional spinner when they opted for the off spin of Randiv for the medium-pace of Dasun Shanaka.
With the wicket dry and offering a little spin and bounce playing an extra spinner could become handy for Sri Lanka when England begin their run chase.
The first ODI played at Trent Bridge ended in a tie.
