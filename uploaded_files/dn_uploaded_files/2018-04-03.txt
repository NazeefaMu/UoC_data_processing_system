19TH MATARA BATTLE OF THE BLUES L/O ENCOUNTER
STC wins by seven runs on D/L method
St Thomas College won the 19th Battle of the Blues one day encounter against St Servatius College by seven runs (D/L method) at the Uyanwatta stadium last evening. St Servatius were 197/6 at the time the match was stopped.
The match was reduced to 45 overs per team as umpires Palith de Alwis and R P Massalage decided that the damp patches on the wicket should dry up sufficiently before the game could start.
Lahiru Dilshan (26 off 30 balls) and Nipun Ruchira (11 off 25 balls) gave the Thomian innings a good start with an opening stand of 39 runs in 8.4 overs after they elected to bat first.
In the 24th over the Servatian bowlers were able to take control and had the Thomians in a spot at 88/5 but a well compiled 36 off 62 balls by Kavindu Ridmal and a captains innings of an unbeaten 77 off 64 balls with 9 boundaries by Tharusha Kavindya helped them reach 226/7 at the end of 45 overs.
Servatian skipper Thilan Prashan and Pasindu Manupriya captured two wickets each.
The Servatians lost their first wicket at 7 and powered by an unbeaten 56 off 84 balls by Risira Lakwin and a cracking 27 off 14 balls which included 2 sixes by skipper Thilan Prashan helped the Servatians at 197/5 when Isuru Udayanga was caught brilliantly on the ropes by Mihisal Amoda. After the umpires ruled it out a controversy
took place if it was a six or a catch causing a delay at which time they had no choice but to call bad light. At the time the Thomians were seven runs ahead on the D/L method
The Servatian team for the 19th limited over encounter led by Thilan Prashan comprised of Isuru Udayanga, Supun Kavinda, Shashika Dulshan, Keshara Nuwantha, Pasindu Manupriya, Pushpitha Dilshan, Risira Lakwin, Chethaka Denuwan and Ruwinda Rochana with Sandaru Nethmina as 12th man.
The Thomians led by Tharusha Kavindya, Maleesha de Seram, Mihisal Amoda, Lahiru Dilshan, Gishanthika Jayaweera, Hirantha Lakshan, Sachira Rashmika, Sineth Sithara, Nipun Ruchira and Chamika Ranasinghe with Harindu Jayasekera as 12th man.
St Thomas Matara 226/7 in 45 overs (Lahiru Dilshan 26, Hirantha Lakshan 21, Mihisal Amoda 21, Tharusha Kavindya 77 not out, Kavindu Ridmal 36, Thilan Prashan 2/45, Pasindu Manupriya 2/34, Shashika Dulshan1/38,

Sun, sea and equality at Commonwealth Games
Gold Coast, Monday: The Commonwealth Games are "more relevant now than ever", organisers said on Monday as they got ready to fire the starting gun on 11 days of competition at Australia's Gold Coast.
Questions have been asked about the standing and modern appeal of the tournament, an echo of colonialism which began as the British Empire Games in 1930.
But officials said the Games still had a role to play, pointing to the groundbreaking move to have an equal number of men's and women's medal events, and the policy of including para sports in the main programme.
"The Commonwealth has stood for generations now for fighting for fairness and freedom," said David Grevemberg, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation.
"From our standpoint we're more relevant now than ever before for the things that have historically challenged the Commonwealth, to the ambitions and aspirations that this Commonwealth looks to uphold: peace, prosperity, good governance and human rights."
After Wednesday's opening ceremony, about 4,300 athletes from 71 nations and territories will compete across 23 sports in Gold Coast, a beach-fringed city in Australia's east.
Games chairman Peter Beattie said the Olympics should take note of the Commonwealth's move to gender equality for medal events, which he described as a first for a major Games.
"The Commonwealth Games stands for some things that are different: gender equality is one, inclusiveness is another," Beattie said. He added: "Of course it makes a difference that there are equal numbers of medals for men and women. Perhaps that's something the Olympics should follow."
'Stolenwealth Games'
Australian cycling great Anna Meares said the Games remained well regarded by athletes, and provided a crucial opportunity to gain experience.
"The people who seem to critique it and question its relevance are people who perhaps aren't involved in the sport itself," the former Olympic and Commonwealth champion said.
"You ask any athlete where the relevance of the Commonwealth Games sit and they'll tell you it's right up there."However, not everyone is happy about the tournament and indigenous protesters have organised demonstrations against what they call the "Stolenwealth Games".
As the opening ceremony nears, Games organisers are also grappling with a possible doping controversy after the discovery of syringes in the athletes' village.
Grevemberg said the syringes were still being analysed but that one team, believed to be India, had been summoned over a breach of the Games' "no-needle" policy.
England's Adam Peaty and Australia's heavyweight team will highlight the swimming events, while Jamaica's Yohan Blake and Elaine Thompson will look to set the track alight following the retirement of Olympic sprint icon Usain Bolt.
Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei headlines a strong badminton tournament and Olympic champions Australia will hope to become the inaugural gold medallists when women's rugby makes its Games debut. Forecasts of wet weather for Wednesday and the following days didn't deter Beattie, who declared: "A little bit of rain is not going to ruin the opening ceremony." He added: "Queenslanders and Australians are very tenacious. We'll just do singing in the rain if that's what happens." AFP

Tribute: My father had many facets, not many faces
One year ago on this date, Ravi Jayewardene, only son of late President J. R. Jayewardene passed away. Among his many achievements, Ravi Jayewardene was a lifelong Buddhist meditator. In acknowledgement of his life and legacy, his son Rukshan Jayewardene, Conservationist, shares his personal tribute, as spoken at the funeral on behalf of the family, shortly before his fathers cremation on April 06, 2017.
Funeral Speech by Rukshan Jayewardene, his second son.
Today, we are gathered here to witness the cremation of my beloved father Ravi Jayewardene.
This is a day I have dreaded since the age of 16, when I shook hands with him and became reacquainted after a separation of nearly 6 years. Our father-son relationship was re-established. That day, I decided to grab hold of this man who was like quicksilver and never let go. Like most books are judged by their cover, people judge others by externalities. My father had many facets, not many faces. So many people knew him in many different areas of his life and at many different times during his 80 years of existence on this earth.
One thing everybody knew about Ravi Jayewardene that was unchanging, was his simple, straight-forward compassionate self. Unfortunately, he was much misunderstood in his lifetime but simple folk in faraway places knew him best. He was not the perfect father, but who is He was not the perfect husband, but who is And who are we to judge In this worldly existence, there is no absolute perfection. Only in relative terms is there something approaching it. Within that framework, he was a perfectionist. He was a fierce patriot, but was loved by people of all ethnic groups within this island of ours and beyond.
During his lifetime, he never received the respect and honour he deserved, due to his reticent nature. Others however took advantage of his noble qualities. Anyway, at least in this last hour of his corporeal remains on earth, the force he created and gifted to this nation has taken upon itself to give this man his due.
In 1982, I was down in the Welikanda area, involved with a census and assessment of the elephant population of the Eastern Province. I was the most junior member of the team. One member was an old friend of my father and we got talking. In my youthful enthusiasm, I blurted out that I considered my father to be a greater man than my grandfather (although I loved both very much and owed the former far more than my own father). This friend of my father scolded me severely for making such a statement. Chastised, I fell silent, although I never changed my mind.
Today, I have the strength of my convictions that transcend mere mundane considerations and the satisfaction and lack of regret of a son who has done his duty by his father, as much as is humanly possible. Life often doesnt give us these second chances.
May he attain the Nibbana that he so richly deserves.

UNP sure of defeating NCM - Akila
The UNP yesterday vowed to defeat the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe securing more than 120 votes. With less than 48 hours remaining for the Parliamentary debate on the NCM submitted by the Joint Opposition, UNP Deputy General Secretary and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam predicted that unexpected forces would join hands for a sure defeat of the motion.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara speaking to the media at the Sirikotha UNP Head Office along with Minister Kariyawasam implied that two or three members of the Joint Opposition would vote against the motion.
They were firm that the SLFP members in the Government ranks, who vote against the Prime Minister at the NCM, should cease to be in the Government, adding that the UNP members would line up to force them out soon after April 4.
Most of the SLFP members, who cry foul while being in the Government, have no peoples mandate. In fact they were against the January 8, 2015 peoples mandate. They entered Parliament from the backdoor. Before supporting the NCM they should have at least resigned from their Cabinet portfolios,Kariyawasam said.
When a journalist drew the Ministers attention to a statement by UNP backbencher Chaminda Wijesiri that they were ready to bring in an impeachment motion against the President after the defeat of the NCM, Minister Kariyawasam said the party has not yet taken such a decision.
The minister, observing that the UNP would face the NCM as one group, said the spadework for the partys victory at the Presidential and General Elections in 2020 would commence soon after the motion.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara said the JOs divisions would deepen following the NCM, adding that some JO MPs were already criticizing the timing of the motion. He said the SLFPers in the Government are also divided on the NCM.
Some of them are trying to fight for their political survival by aligning with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa following the SLFPs poor performance at the last Local Government elections. Some of them are trying to join the UNP and we welcome them, but they have no say in our party internal matters and those matters would be solved among ourselves, he said adding that major reforms within the party are expected after April 4.

US State Dept. proposes social media-screening for SL travellers
Under new rules proposed by the U.S. State Department, Sri Lankans travelling to the States would have to disclose any social media identities they had used over the past five years.
The move would affect an estimated 14 million travellers from a majority of countries around the world, except for major U.S. allies such as Australia, Japan and the U.K., which have visa-free travel agreements.
Maintaining robust screening standards for visa applicants is a dynamic practice that must adapt to emerging threats, the U.S. State Department said in a statement, last week.
Applicants applying for non-immigrant visas to the U.S. already have to supply certain details such as contact information, travel history, names of family members and previous addresses. Collecting this additional information from visa applicants would strengthen our process for vetting these applicants and confirming their identity, the State Department said.
The proposal lists about 20 social media platforms that travellers would have to disclose when applying for a visa. Many of them, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, are popular in Sri Lanka.
Consular officers would use this additional information only to vet applicants for potential visa ineligibility under existing U.S. law, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson said on Monday.
The embassy said they would not ask for account passwords or attempt to subvert existing privacy protocols.
The Embassy issued nearly 17,000 travel visas to Sri Lankans last year, according to State Department data.
The proposal still requires final approval from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, following a 60-day public comment period.

Viable reconciliation measures
It is vitally necessary to understand the role of UNHRC in the modern global context. There is a tendency among the young left oriented atavists to classify every international institute, formed under the influence of UN, as reactionary and a new instrument of exploitation. In their analysis, the factor of international labour and its intervention is not taken into consideration.
It is futile to classify UNHRC and other international organisations as instruments of global capital and imperialism, and neglect the power of organised labour however conservative it appears. In the modern world side by side of global capital, international labour plays a massive role in the fight for human rights and other social rights.
On the other hand, it is hilarious to claim Donald Trump has tightened the HR conditions on Lanka! Truth is the power of international labour has compelled Lanka to retreat. Already power of labour is indicated by signing the DSP +, which would give much benefit to Lanka. Donald Trump had to bow down to the power of international labour even though he is living in dream world of fascism.
All liberal analysts agree that one of the most unfortunate features of the present time in Lanka is that the government alliance shows signs of disintegration.
This is on account of the rivalry between the two parties; including their leadership that shows no signs of abating, and for which statesmanship is required if it is to be overcome.
Local government elections
The dissolved condition of the government was seen in its poor electoral performance at the local government elections held last month. UNP did not launch a dynamic campaign.
The opposition parties made use of the co-signed resolution to allege that the government was too subservient to foreign powers. They said country sold to US, to conduct an emotive campaign against the government.
It used arguments of nationalism, patriotism and betrayal that showed, if not countered and crushed, its potential to sweep the government off its feet at other national elections to come.
This has aroused the for democracy peoples movement which has criticized both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena.
In this difficult context, there is a positive role that the international community can play.
Its nurturing role can be seen in the manner in which specialized international agencies have taken on responsibility for supporting the establishment of viable reconciliation mechanisms that the government has promised.
It would be more constructive for the international community to be supportive rather than add to the pressures on the government in a manner that would further undermine it electorally.
An example of constructive support would be the role played by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). For many years this organisation has played a key role in gaining humanitarian access to the war zones of the North and East.
Yes, it is true that the sessions of the UNHRC in Geneva no longer occupy media headlines as they did in the past when the fascistic Mahinda government used the occasion to confront the international community; but they are still very important.
Because it does not mean that the country is able to deal successfully with the issues identified in the resolution. The suspicions and mistrust that continue to undermine inter-nationality relations within the country are an obstruction to their implementation.
TNA and Tamil Diaspora
The TNA and the Tamil Diaspora represented by the Global Tamil Forum have been urging the UNHRC in Geneva to extend the period of their scrutiny of the implementation of the resolution. This is because of their concern that if such international scrutiny ceases there will be even less incentive for the government to continue with the task. Tamil leaders were patient but were pressing the Yahapalanaya to implement the conditions accepted in the UNHRC agreement.
A delegation of the TNA supported by the Global Tamil Forum visited the United States of America at the time when Lanka has been under scrutiny at the UN in Geneva.
TNA was with appointments secured from the relevant highest levels of authority at the UN, US Administration and Government and the Norwegian Government. Before that TNA continued engagement with the Government of Lanka to encourage implementation of 2015 manifesto commitments, and commitments made to all Lankans and the international community.
The delegation included Sumanthiran, Lanka Member of Parliament of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), and Father S J Emmanuel, President of the Global Tamil Forum (GTF), now resident in Lanka. Among other serious concerns, the delegation discussed the need to demand Government of Lanka to commit to a time-bound implementation plan of resolutions 30/1 & 34/1 of the UNHRC and the need for UNHRC monitoring and oversight over Sri Lanka beyond March 2019. Delivering a joint statement in Geneva, the UK said Lanka is safer and freer than it was in 2015.
However, it added that it was disappointed that the pace of progress has been slow. It stated that Much still remains to be done to implement Sri Lanka's commitments. We remain concerned about reports of abuse of authority by some security officials.
And multiple incidents of inter-communal violence, attacks, and hate speech against minorities are alarming and demonstrate the need for reconciliation efforts.
As Sri Lanka acknowledged with its co-sponsorship of resolution 30/1, devolution of political authority through constitutional reform is integral to lasting reconciliation and non-recurrence of violations and abuses.
Families of disappeared persons from all communities have waited too long for answers.
We urge that the Office of Missing Persons be fully operational without delay, and for meaningful steps to establish the other transitional justice mechanisms outlined in resolution 30/1.
Effective security sector reforms, repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, and release of more military-occupied land to civilian ownership will all help build trust and confidence.
This is a serious reminder!

Vidyartha maintained their rugby standard, while collecting points through six goals, three tries and one penalty to 15 one goal, one try and one penalty. At half time winners led 15-7.
Vidyartha ruggerites got into business from the kick off and virtually dominated the forward and back division play.
More importantly they were quite outstanding in the loose play and combined well in the rucks and mauls. Sylverstains who usually play good rugby did not live up to their reputation in this game.

Women at the wheel
March is known as the month which empowers women as the International Womens Day falls on this month. Popular taxi hailing app Pick Me has commemorated the month by launching Pick Me Sri Liya Abhinandan which allows Sri Lankan women to gain an income as taxi drivers.
Women taxi drivers are a rare sight in the city. However if it is introduced in the correct manner with safety rules and regulations this behind the wheels profession can be a lucrative initiative for women.
Pick Me has picked up on this idea and come up with a novel way of making job opportunities available for women in this arena.
Female labour participation serves as a significant component of labour utilization in an economy. Women have always played a leading role in bringing income to the nation. Our aim is to give them an hand in becoming successful entrepreneurs without necessarily being part of the corporate workforce, said Pick Me Chief Executive Officer Zulfer Jiffry.
He notes that the Pick Me female drivers they have employed so far have shown extraordinary skills in time and finance management. Being mothers and juggling household chores with a multiple professions, they also drive the taxis full time. Some of them are even single mothers yet they manage to face the trials in life single handedly and with courage.
They inspire positive change in the community. We provide them with an environment in which they can work without fear of being undermined, underappreciated and undervalued, he added.
One of the main reasons women do not get into the driving profession is because of the safety concerns related to the job. However the Pick Me teams assures that since the drivers are equipped with the information of their customers they would not be facing issues concerning their safety.
Pick Me currently has around 30 female drivers driving all types of vehicles from three wheelers to sedans. Pick Me hosts the largest organised taxi fleet in the country with over 12,000 three wheelers, mini cars, cars, vans and luxury sedans. Their passenger base is over one million. Pick Me also provides corporate travelling solutions to businesses and organisations with the Pick Me Business Portal, the benefits of which is currently enjoyed by over 150 corporates in the country.
Speaking to the media 33-year-old Lasanda Deepthi, the driver of a tuk-tuk and a mother with one school-going child, says that this profession provides her with the ideal opportunity to make a living whilst multi tasking with her duties as a mother.
I have enough time to drop my daughter at school and take her to classes. I run hires in my three-wheeler during my spare time so that I can make a few pennies on the side, she said.
Senani de Silva joined PickMe as a lady driver in October 2015. She says that it began as a part time profession for her. However later she decided to do it full time since she could earn more from the job.
I gave up on my Government job and started driving the taxi. Sometimes I have worked for 24 hours. Usually by the time I finish my work it is 3 or 4 am. I have never faced any embarrassing or difficult situations, she expressed. For Sunethra Jayaweera being behind the wheel is a stress reviver. She terms it as a convenient female centric profession.
We can manage this job while attending to our family commitments. We can engage in this profession without depending on others to bring the money home, she noted. Deepthi notes that respect is an important factor to her. The passengers have been very understanding towards her and had even given her helpful advice like on safer roads to take.
Many of my passengers have told me that it was their first experience with a female three-wheeler driver. Overall I am very happy with the response I have got so far, she said.

No ban on pandals  during Vesak
During an interview with the Daily News in Kurunegala, yesterday, Buddhasana Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera said he had not imposed a ban on pandals during this years Vesak festival.
I only requested youth to refrain from using unnecessary decorations and instead, to take part in proper religious practices. No minister could impose such a ban sans Cabinet approval. However, certain newspapers had misinterpreted what I said, he added.

Panadura South Police understaffed
Panadura South Police are currently understaffed and hence, numbers of extortionists and drug-traffickers within the Panadura area, are currently on the rise.
Therefore, the Police Department must provide sufficient officers to the Panadura South Police, Panadura United National Party Chief Organiser and newly-appointed Panadura Urban Council (UC) Chairman Nandana Gunathilake said.
When I was previously the Panadura Urban Council Chairman for two years, I made arrangements with the police to conduct raids, but a minister from the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime interfered with the operations. Since then, Panadura has become a kingdom of crime.
Therefore, the Urban Council has decided to cooperate with Panadura South Police, to eradicate the prevailing crime spree, he added.
Gunathilake requested the cooperation and assistance of the public, to bring such culprits to book and added that the Panadura UC, together with the police, would fulfil their pledge to curb the prevailing issue in due time.

Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran said yesterday that a decision taken by the Tamil National Alliances (TNAs) with regard to the No-confidence Motion motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in parliament, should be one that benefits the Tamil people.
He added that the TNA should reach an understanding in writing with its party members, before voting takes place in parliament. The chief minister said that United National Party parliaemntarians who stood against the Prime Minister, had not come to an understanding with him yet and hence, there was doubt over their decision.

United National Front will vote against NCM
The United National Front (UNF) Parliamentary Group yesterday unanimously decided to vote against the No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Power and Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera said.
Speaking to journalists after participating in a special discussion between the Prime Minister and the NFF Parliamentary Group members in Temple Trees yesterday, the Minister said the NCM is not against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, but against the entire government.
The President as the head of the government and the Cabinet Ministers represent the government. This has not targeted only the Prime Minister, the Minister said.
The former government had failed to conduct adequate investigations into serious crimes. Now all the investigations are in the final stages and rapidly progressing including the legal action against the responsible persons involved in the bond scam.
Therefore, this is a futile effort of the JO since the legal action have already been taken against wrongdoers, the Minister said.
He said that Prime Minister agreed to restructure and reform the Party. The partys Parliamentary Group on Management and Policymaking and the members of the Working Committee will meet on April 7 and 8 to discuss this process further.
The NCM will face sure defeat when it is taken up for debate on April 4. Then a draft law to establish a
new Anti-Corruption High Court will be presented to Parliament on April 5 as a part of the governments mission for an expeditious and efficient administration of criminal justice, the Minister said.
MP. Ven. Athuraliye Rathna Thera also participated the discussion. The Thera did not hold different views and We all are in the common stand on this issue, he said.
Home Affairs Deputy Ministers JC Alawathugoda said all members in the NFF Parliamentary Group will vote to defeat the NCM against the Prime Minister. Lots of members expressed their pleasure at attending the debate to support the Premier on April 4, the Minister said.
UNP MP Nalin Bandara said the UNF has majority of votes to defeat the motion. It is revealed around 15 to 20 members of the SLFP will support us while the TNA will vote in favour of the Premier. We are sure that two or three members of the Pohottuwa party will also be with us on January 4, he said.
UNP MP Harshana Rajakaruna said that the government and the UNP will be stronger with the victory on April 4.

State policies should be based on interests of public
State policies should be created based on the interests of the public rather than the self interest of politicians, said Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa.
The minister was speaking at the opening ceremony of the Sayaisurugama reawakened village at Weligama on March 31. Sayaisurugama is the 51st reawakened village to be vested with the public.
This village provides shelter for 33 families with pure drinking water, electricity and roadways at a cost of Rs. 213 lakhs, said the minister. Our aim is to construct 2,500 reawakened villages by 2020 and 650 reawakened villages must be constructed annually to reach the target. We are confident of facing the next general elections after constructing 2,500 reawakened villages. However, our primary goal is to provide shelter for every family in the country by 2025, irrespective of the caste, religion or race.
The minister granted housing loans worth Rs. 214 lakhs to 205 families. One-hundred-and-fifty pregnant mothers were given nutritious foodstuffs totalling Rs. 300,000. Books worth Rs.100,000 were given to 55 schoolchildren. The minister also awarded spectacles worth Rs. 452,000 to 1,115 persons.
I undertook this ministry in 2015, he said. We did not have the necessary statistics to calculate the housing needs in the country. After conducting a census, we realised that 250,000 families need houses. The powerful men created shelters for their own selves and their families during the past years, instead of creating shelter for the public. But my fathers wish was to give shelter to the underemployed. We follow his vision now and we do our best to make Sri Lanka free of poverty and housing issues.
The minister pointed out the necessity to fulfil the needs of the citizens.
We should carry out policies which are beneficial to the public. Schoolchildren must be given uniforms instead of vouchers. The citizens should get fertilizer subsidies."
"The government must provide jobs for unemployed degree-holders. We should build this country knowing the heartbeat of its citizens.

ADB approves US$100 mn additional funding to Lanka
The Asian Development Banks (ADB) Board of Directors has approved a $100 million results-based loan as additional financing for the Governments efforts to develop skills to meet labor demands, support economic diversification, and enhance productivity in the country.
Sri Lanka has achieved universal primary and high secondary enrollment rates, a high adult literacy rate, and gender parity in access to all levels of education. However, there remains a clear mismatch between skills among youth and labour market demand, said Gi Soon Song, an ADB Principal Social Sector Specialist. The ongoing skills enhancement program, spearheaded by the government and supported by ADB, will address this issue through a focus on technical and vocational education and policy support.
This lack of skilled labour is hurting the Sri Lankan economy, with the countrys private sector considering this as a key constraint to business growth. The unemployment rate is also high, with one out of five Sri Lankans aged 15-24 years out of work. Meanwhile, only 35.9% of women are included in the labour force despite outperforming male counterparts academically at every level. Equipping youth, especially young women, with employable skills is crucial to decrease youth unemployment and prepare the workforce for a high value-adding economy.
The additional funding will enable the government to continue implementing the Skills Sector Development Program (SSDP), which is supported by a $100 million ADB loan approved in 2014, through 2020. SSDP aims to significantly improve the quality of TVET provided to young people in Sri Lanka to increase their employability, while also enhancing partnerships with the private sector for better TVET planning and provision to align skilled labour supply with market demand. The program is also increasing the number of TVET graduates and improving policy, institutional, and operational reforms to support the countrys skills sector.
The programs first phase (2014-2016) has been performing well, with the employment rate of technical and vocational education and training (TVET) graduates rising from 50% in 2012 to 57% in 2015, exceeding the 55% target. The additional financing will expand successful program activities and accelerate the pace of reform initiatives.

Adopt method to exchange defaced currency: Gemunu Wijeratne

Lanka Private Bus Owners Association President Gemunu Wijeratne proposed the Central Bank to adopt a mechanism to exchange defaced currency through commercial banks in order to avoid inconveniences faced by bus commuters.
Wijeratne made this proposal at a press briefing held in Colombo, today.
Furthermore Wijeratne said that around seven to eight million individuals commute by busses each day and currency worth approximately Rs.400 million is exchanged per day.
Commuters still possess defaced currency and we cant demand passengers who produce those notes to get down from the bus, he said.
Even though the Central Bank declared that the use of defaced currency was eliminated from April 1, those notes are still circulating among the public, he added.
Expressing their grievances, Wijeratne said that bus conductors are not capable of being peculiar about avoiding defaced notes when issuing tickets all the time.
Wijeratne urged the Central Bank to keep commercial banks open at least once a week for six months to exchange defaced notes.
Furthermore he said that the Private Bus Owners Association will render their full support to the government if they take measures to install an electronic payment method.

Air Force to be revamped - President
Necessary steps will be taken by the Government to revamp the Sri Lanka Air Force and strengthen it with the latest technology in line with other forces of the developed world. This will include the infusion of knowledge and technological skills. The necessary guidance and advise would be sought from developed countries for this purpose, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was addressing the gathering at the President Colours Awards Ceremony held at the Diyatalawa Air Force Combat Training School last morning.
President Sirisena said he was pleased to attend the colour awards ceremony held at this school to honour and convey the nations gratitude to the Air Force combat school which had rendered a sterling service to the nation for a very long period.
The President said the Tri Forces of this country had performed a yeoman service to the Motherland during the past few decades. Foremost among them was the dedication made to defeat LTTE terrorism which had been a bane to the country for nearly 28 years.
The Sri Lanka Air Force had performed its duty and responsibility in the protection of the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity and joined their counterpart Armed Forces to save the country during national disaster situations, President Sirisena said.
Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy said the Presidential Colours Awards Ceremony marked an important cross road in the 67-year-old history of the Sri Lanka Air Force.
President Sirisenas decision to hold a Presidential Colours Awards Ceremony to convey the highest honour to the service rendered by the Air Force was most praiseworthy. The Sri Lanka Air Force had been a partner in the countrys development process too. Several welfare measures had already been initiated by the Air Force such as the donation of houses to War Heroes, scholarship awards to children of Air Force personnel and remedying of salary anomalies, the Air Force Commander said.
Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijayagoonaratne, Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake, Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimewan Ranasinghe Commander, Diyatalawa, Air Force Combat Training school Air Commodore Peterson Fernando and Air Force Media Spokesman Gihan Seneviratne were also present on the occasion.

## Title: Analogies and similes for hot exotic chillies
## Supertitle:

Analogies and similes for hot exotic chillies
Everyone has an opinion about chillies. Arguably, they are the most contentious foods in the world, triggering red hot debates as to their origin, authenticity, preparation, and influence on international culinary practices.
I am no botanical or biological genius but am of the firm belief that chillies possess a remarkable resemblance to women in character, size and shape. They come in a variety of colours, shapes and flavours. They can be white, red, green, orange, purple or almost the colour of chocolate.
They can be pointy, round, small, club like, long, thin, globular, tapered, or bell shaped. Chillies are one of the most intense taste sensations many of us, even the ladies they are likened to can enjoy. When capsaicin, the primary substance found in chillies, is ingested, the sensory nerves of the mouth and throat send a message to the brain and heart rate and sweating automatically increase, along with our level of endorphins, the bodys natural pain killers.
There are also different varieties of the habenero type round ones that pack a huge zap. Because of their spherical shape the Sri Lankans call them Bolay Miris. Their skin is smooth, shiny and undulating and the shape, though highly variable, are roughly the same as a tomato although on a smaller scale.
But these mini tomato-like veggies can cause a great deal of scorching distress to your mouth, gullet, intestines and finally make your porta feel like a pin cushion.
Many hardened chillie buffs prefer the hotter bell-bottomed ones which some quick witted Sri Lankans mischievously describe as the Bola -Wathies of the genre. They are referring mischievously to those dames displaying their sagging bell-bottomous proportions. Besides, in similarity to the females of the species their skin may be shiny, smooth or wrinkled and their walls may be thick or thin.
Again in likeness to the different feminine dispositions not all chillies are hot. But do not be deceived. Be assured that only a few of them are as mild as capsicums. The local capsicum, referred to as the malu miris is known as the banana chillie pepper in the West.
Besides, the real hot head chillie aficionados would look down their noses at the milder varieties used to dress up fancy salads. Now, that may seem hilarious to you and me, but it aint one bit funny to a chilihead. Thats what they call themselves, the fundamentalists of the chillie religion, the chiliegious, if you will. Yes siree, they will tell you that bell peppers and capsicums are strictly for sissies! Remember, the colour of chillies is no guide to the intensity of their bite or flavour. Nor is the size.
Watch out in particular for the tiniest variety, commonly called the kochchi miris in Sri Lanka. It is a smaller but more potent version of the regular chillie. Yes, they are so fiery that diminutive women with explosive tempers often earn the appellation kochchi karala. In Malaysia and Singapore they are called Chillie Padi. Again a euphemism used to describe a petite, feisty woman who has the disposition and personality of a fiery pod.
In all, it means a personality or something small in size but packs a mean punch. Only the very bravest among the Chillie Heads and lecher boys will dare trifle with the zany, zesty, pint sized fiery pods or the tiny plucky women who have earned the moniker. It certainly does reinforce the reality that good things come in small packages and pack a heck of a blazing punch to boot!
The deep red colour of many varieties of chillies suggests that their association with love and passion has become a universal belief. That is because in many cultures the colour red is linked to these titillating emotions.
The fiery nature of the fruit, because of its spicy heat, gives it naughty connotations that have served to increase its erotic appeal.
Yes certainly, looks can be deceptive, because the tiny Kochchi pod can explode like a firebomb in the gut. As it is, the looks of some varieties equated with those of many women may set the male adrenaline pumping. But as in all such close associations the sting is sure to follow. True, your lips will tingle, your mouth will burn, your toes will curl, but with an otherworldly painful passion you would never have bargained for.
Some of the other docile shapes and textures relating to the contours of women should not be trifled with either. There is no knowing when their mild looks will surpass their crazy heat. Besides, their scorching heat can blow your socks off if you trifle with the Carolina Reaper the wicked witch of all chillies.
A former Indian colleague named Rajaram who worked with me in Singapore said: The hotter and most texture in both the chillie and the lady, the higher the esteem in my eyes. Its a mans thing, I shay.
Rajaram said as far as he was concerned both women and chillies were equally precious and indispensible. According to him: You know yaar they complement each other so well. I shay, I yam yalways in hot pursuit of both.
Rajaram helped himself to a some fresh raw chillie padi pods to complement the bland egg sandwiches we had been served during a cricket match tea break in Singapore. He walked up to two of his British team mates who inquired what the side dish was.
Rajaram quipped: Yaall hot shot Brits will never be able to take it. One of them Jimmy answered: Why you doubting Indian, Ill show you. These are the tiniest chillie peppers Ive ever seen! Then he popped about four pods into his mouth while offering a handful to his compatriot Alan, a copy editor.
It wasnt long before the players and spectators were given an entertaining cameo by the two expatriates who had been caught up in an uncontrollable vortex of their own making. Very soon they were skittering around swirling and tripping over themselves in a frantic search for water and beer to quench the flames within. Unable to bear the burning sensation in their tongues and gullets and perhaps imagining that they might ignite at any moment they sought any liquid panacea available.
He continued with perverse relish: Hokay, hokay. But I yam giving just giving yadvance notice that once the pain in your mouth subsides its going to burn on the vay in and ... vell, you get the picture. Aiyaa Saami! Its going to be a moving experience.
Im not sure what you are supposed to taste besides pain. Now when you go home fill up your old tin bath with cold water. Youre going to need it!
It was enough to give the uninitiated the chillie-willies!

Are import restrictions and high tariffs a threat to world trade
Is there a looming trade war between large nations The global scenario on trade that is dominated by the large countries seem increasingly poised to battle it out if a trade war breaks out.
Though the international media run many stories on this tense topic that will also engulf poorer countries like Sri Lanka, this writer was in particular impressed by a critical lead article in this regard in an International magazine.
The Economist in the issue of March 10th-16th 2018 claims that President Donald Trump though appears to be the first U.S. President to hit the road to protectionism, he was not.
Protectionism at least in the context of imposing tariffs on imports, Trump was super-ceded by other U.S.Presidents in the somewhat distant past. The Economist mentions that President Jimmy Carter was to an extent initially protectionist. During the Carter regime,the product that was subject to high import tariff was steel. This time too it is steel.
The current U.S. administration plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminium imports respectively.
The two tariffs alone will not lead to debilitating damage to the U.S. economy. But they may trigger a potential disaster for both the U.S. and the world economy.
Let us examine the fearsome situation projected closely.
Incidentally in 2016 steel and aluminium imports to the U.S.accounted for only 2% of all imports to the U.S. Last year imports to U.S. amounted to US$ 3 trillion.
Free Trade and President Trump
The Economist observes that ever since Trump assumed office he has been sneering at free trade, besides the existent multi-lateral trading system.
According to the U.S. administration this system is detrimental to its interests. Meanwhile, Trumps Chief Economic Advisor who was widely considered a rare advocate of free trade within the establishment, recently resigned from his post and that was believed to be a major setback for the U.S.
It now looks as if that there is an ill-wind about to blow against the long held belief of a liberal international trade environment and within that trade environment a main proponent had been the United States. It is now the U.S. which is a conscious opponent of a free trade regime.
A multidimensional danger
The imposition of high tariff to curb imports by the worlds largest economy may lead to a retaliatory effect.
It is the U.S. that will first face the counter import sanctions imposed by those nations affected. The U.S. to cite an example is thinking in turn of imposing high tariffs on import of cars from Europe.
In retaliation it is reported by the foreign media that products like bourbon and motor cycles ( Harley Davidson) exported by the U.S. will face sanctions.
And why should the US build a tariff wall in respect of steel imports on the basis of such exports are a security risk. Observers on trade state that the security factor cited is spurious since these products exported to the U.S are mainly by Canada, Mexico and South Korea, firm allies of the U.S .
The real truth is reportedly different. It is to gain leverage to the planned re-negotiation of NAFTA. = the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Over a period of time Trump had been highly critical of NAFTA. His criticism had gone viral and this gave indications that President Trump is thinking of a protectionist approach to exports into U.S. and that he is considering a revisionist attitude to NAFTA.
The emerging picture cloudy and complex
The emerging picture of the much talked of high tariff and retaliatory effect remains complex and unclear. To begin with observers of the current scenario wonder whether the imposition of tariff on grounds of security of a nation could be challenged legally.
Enters the (WTO) World Trade Organisation into the picture.
The lead article in the Economist has queried whether the WTO will react positively to this situation. But the WTO, it is contended has long been troubled by the failure of the Doha Round in 2015.
The additional burden of counteracting action by the powerful U.S will add to it woes or entrap it further. All this of course is speculation and as yet there in nothing definite.
What should however be most worrisome is the WTOs inability to secure a consensus on much needed reforms to the current trading system. As a result of the action required to initiate a new trade round has led to the transfer of the much needed reforms to dispute resolution machinery of the WTO. Such machinery is reportedly too weak.
The prevailing belief is that WTO is not strong enough and also irresolute. As a result trade disputes that could have been dealt with in a new trade round effectively have instead been pushed into its dispute resolution machinery. It is said to be the experience of many nations that the dispute resolution mechanism is too burdensome to the WTO.
Given this situation, if the US issue of high import tariff on steel due to security factor is transferred to the US for resolution through adjudication how will the WTO tackle it, in the face of its awesome current burden( According to the latest information in the Chinese news the issue is said to be already placed before the WTO).
On the other hand, as pointed out by the Economist if the WTO courts cannot adjudicate or if it has second thoughts about the security factor that US has advanced on steel imports, President Trump may even decide to quit the WTO.
The Economist observes that a severely overburdened WTO after 15 years of fruitless search which led to the collapse of the Doha Round will have to confront a much graver situation if the US leaves the WTO.
The Economist is of the view that the WTO has been slow and had not been able to keep abreast of economic change that has transformed the international trade scene.
The magazine is further of the view that the WTO is increasingly involved in intangibles like patents and copy rights, whereas it should in reality consider physical assets like steel mills. Also, the earlier rules it drafted in respect of rich market economies cannot be applied to state directed and controlled capitalism The "Economist cites the example of implicit subsidies afforded by China to its producers of industrial metals. This had led to a glut of such metals and it is not a surprise that China is looked at by some nations thereby affected with dislike.
Tragedy to undermine WTO
In the midst of all these recent developments inimical to the interests of the WTO and whatever its failings had been there are many who state that it will be a tragedy to undermine the WTO.
This could happen if the US adopts a contra mercantilist policy that runs counter to the existent global trading system. If this happens many other nations would follow suit, thereby destroying ,despite flaws largely an orderly and regulated international trade regime. 'The Economist towards the conclusion of their study on this critical subject state that this may not lead to an imminent collapse of the WTO, it is likely to break the very structure of globalization.
Despite purists who are inclined to cast aspersions on globalization, this writer is of the view that globalization has opened vast new frontiers of trading and Asia as a whole had been a big beneficiary.
One just has to look at the economic transformation of China India and the smaller Asian countries. Of course critics will cite the case of continuous trade imbalances partly brought by globalization. On the other hand globalisation has opened the doors of opportunity to many a poor nation through technology transfers and investments, as also through the application of modern supply chain techniques.
The WTO has had a definitive role to play especially in terms of developing countries not only through a regulatory framework but also other .modes of trade promotion.
We are inclined to agree with the Economist the vast improvements to living standards in an impoverished world as it were after the second world war which reduced the barriers of trade were clearly due to the eight trade rounds.
Imports should in most cases be welcome since they benefit the consumer and drive manufacturers towards innovation and new products.
Even without the WTO,cross border trading is bound to continue though subject to less governance and regulation. We are also inclined to agree that international trade in such a case will be without norms and procedures .
An environment sans these basic elements of control will give way to runaway mercantilism. Trade policy will then enter the domain of special interest groups.
What is more military power as pointed out by the 'Economist will come into play and fair play will disappear.
One area in particular that helps global economic growth transnational investment will suffer the most. One could be almost certain that if such an adverse development follows , given the present climate of uncertainty it is The US that will be hit the most so the Economist  contends.
The US has been the most important power in the system of post- war trade whether you like it or not.
If the US does not realize this inevitable fact of life other key nations need to keep their heads calm. On the other hand a tit for tat attitude will plunge other nations too into a state of disaster.
It is vitally important in this context to give all backing possible to trade. Such a backing globally will help to fix WTO all its members should agree on a plan of concerted action. This includes considering Trumps tariffs which will strengthen the WTO though it will be tough for it to solve the issue.
Rule based global economy will then receive a boost and free traders will then be required to recognize that the WTO could play a role against the protectionist lobby. This will however not be easy since the man in the Oval office appears to be the biggest enemy currently of free trade.

Aussie  Campbell eyes redemption after  greatest choke
GOLD COAST: A defiant Cate Campbell has promised a return to her best form at the Commonwealth Games as the Aussie swimmer looks to exorcise the demons of her Olympic flop two years ago.
The 25-year-old is blazing the comeback trail after taking a year out from the sport, prompted by what Campbell described as the greatest choke in Olympic history in Rio -- her sixth-place finish in the 100 metres freestyle final.
Campbell, who is limbering up for the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast this week, rediscovered her mojo at the national trials, where she dominated the 100m freestyle and broke Australian records in the 50m free and 50m butterfly.
I definitely missed being part of the team, she told reporters. To be back in the green and gold, it really makes my heart beat a little bit faster.
Campbell was the red-hot favourite to win the Olympic 100m title in 2016 and led at the turn before fading badly, allowing Canada's Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel to come through and tie for gold. - AFP

Beware, Google is stalking you!
The harvesting of our personal details goes far beyond what many of us could imagine. So I braced myself and had a look.
Want to freak yourself out Im going to show just how much of your information the likes of Facebook and Google store about you without you even realising it.
Google knows where youve been
Google stores your location (if you have location tracking turned on) every time you turn on your phone. You can see a timeline of where youve been from the very first day you started using Google on your phone.
Google knows everything youve ever searched  and deleted
Google stores search history across all your devices. That can mean that, even if you delete your search history and phone history on one device, it may still have data saved from other devices.
Google has an advertisement profile of you
Google creates an advertisement profile based on your information, including your location, gender, age, hobbies, career, interests, relationship status, possible weight (need to lose 10lb in one day) and income.
Google knows all the apps you use
Google stores information on every app and extension you use. They know how often you use them, where you use them, and who you use them to interact with. That means they know who you talk to on Facebook, what countries you are speaking with, what time you go to sleep.
Google has all of your YouTube history
Google stores all of your YouTube history, so they probably know whether youre going to be a parent soon, if youre a conservative, if youre a progressive, if youre Jewish, Christian, or Muslim, if youre feeling depressed or suicidal, if youre anorexic 
The data Google has on you can fill millions of Word documents
Google offers an option to download all of the data it stores about you. Ive requested to download it and the file is 5.5GB big, which is roughly 3m Word documents.
This link includes your bookmarks, emails, contacts, your Google Drive files, all of the above information, your YouTube videos, the photos youve taken on your phone, the businesses youve bought from, the products youve bought through Google 
They also have data from your calendar, your Google hangout sessions, your location history, the music you listen to, the Google books youve purchased, the Google groups youre in, the websites youve created, the phones youve owned, the pages youve shared, how many steps you walk in a day 
Facebook has reams and reams of data on you, too
Facebook offers a similar option to download all your information. Mine was roughly 600MB, which is roughly 400,000 Word documents.
This includes every message youve ever sent or been sent, every file youve ever sent or been sent, all the contacts in your phone, and all the audio messages youve ever sent or been sent.
Facebook stores everything from your stickers to your login location
Facebook also stores what it thinks you might be interested in based off the things youve liked and what you and your friends talk about (I apparently like the topic girl).
Somewhat pointlessly, they also store all the stickers youve ever sent on Facebook (I have no idea why they do this. Its just a joke at this stage).
They also store every time you log in to Facebook, where you logged in from, what time, and from what device.
And they store all the applications youve ever had connected to your Facebook account, so they can guess Im interested in politics and web and graphic design, that I was single between X and Y period with the installation of Tinder, and I got a HTC phone in November.
They can access your webcam and microphone
The data they collect includes tracking where you are, what applications you have installed, when you use them, what you use them for, access to your webcam and microphone at any time, your contacts, your emails, your calendar, your call history, the messages you send and receive, the files you download, the games you play, your photos and videos, your music, your search history, your browsing history, even what radio stations you listen to.
Google has every email you ever sent
Every email Ive ever sent, thats been sent to me, including the ones I deleted or were categorised as spam.
And there is more
Ill just do a short summary of whats in the thousands of files I received under my Google Activity.
First, every Google Ad Ive ever viewed or clicked on, every app Ive ever launched or used and when I did it, every website Ive ever visited and what time I did it at, and every app Ive ever installed or searched for.
They also have every image Ive ever searched for and saved, every location Ive ever searched for or clicked on, every news article Ive ever searched for or read, and every single Google search Ive made since 2009. And then finally, every YouTube video Ive ever searched for or viewed, since 2008.
This information has millions of nefarious uses. You say youre not a terrorist.
Then how come you were googling ISIS Work at Google and youre suspicious of your wife Perfect, just look up her location and search history for the last 10 years. Manage to gain access to someones Google account Perfect, you have a chronological diary of everything that person has done for the last 10 years.
This is one of the craziest things about the modern age. We would never let the government or a corporation put cameras/microphones in our homes or location trackers on us.

BOC posts Rs 30.3 bn PBT
Bank of Ceylon, having completed 78 successful years, posted an Rs.30.3 billion Profit Before Tax (PBT) closed 2017.
The Bank has recorded an impressive 8% growth in PBT, when adjusted for the one off gain recorded in 2016 (ie: disposal of Mireka Capital Lanka (Pvt) Ltd).
With this, BoC continues to maintain its position as the highest profit earning single entity of the country. Profit after tax for the year stood at Rs.21.3 billion, General Manager Senarath Bandara stated.
The total operating income has grown by 3% within the year notching Rs. 74.3 billion mark. Net interest income has contributed to 78% of the total operating income and the YoY growth of the net interest income has been 8%. Although we are moving fast towards digitally enabled banking culture, the weightage we have placed on improving the quality of human touch has never been compromised.
We believe the human factor, yet has much more to do with customer care and tangibility, Chairman, Ronald C. Perera.
In March 2017 Standing Deposit Facility Ratio (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Ratio (SLFR) was increased by 25 bps up to 7.25% and 8.75% respectively.
Followed by the change in policy rates, the market interest rates moved further upward and the high interest rate regime which prevailed throughout the year except for the latter part of the year in which interest rates recorded a slight slowdown.
Whilst, the increasing trend in market interest rates has resulted in an increase in both interest income and expenses, the net interest margin of the Bank has only shredded by 10 bsp over the previous year due to its effective management of cost of funding. Interest income earned through investment activities particularly in Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds also contributed towards the growth in the net interest income.
In the midst of a subdued performance reported from the trade sector, the Bank has reported a growth of its net fee and commission income due to the timely and meticulous strategies it has adopted to diversify their avenues of revenue.
Net operating income for the period reflected a marginal reduction of 4% mainly due to Rs. 4.9 billion increment reported in impairment charges.
The successful credit management policies adopted has enabled the Bank to maintain the NPA ratio at 2.8%, as in the previous year.
The Bank has been able to achieve a 9% reduction in its total operating expenses due to efficiencies achieved via many process changes introduced. Also depicting the Banks effective cost benefit management, the cost to income ratio has come down to 38% from 43% the previous year.

Bracing for the next century
How do you cover 100 years in 12 minutes That was the question the Pulitzer at 100 had when they set out to make a short film to celebrate the centennial of the Pulitzer Prizes in 2016.
They wanted a film that paid homage to the past but also conveyed the present and pointed to the future. They wanted the film to reflect the four themes of the celebration, all subjects of much prize-winning work over the years: Social Justice and Equality, War and Peace, The Presidency, and Power and Accountability.
A real book is not one that we read, but one that reads us, wrote W H Auden years ago. Same could be said of journalism. One photograph or a piece of writing has the power to reach the common audience on a deeper level and help them recognise something essential about themselves.
Pulitzers strength
At the turn of the 19th century, one journalist cum entrepreneur recognised this requirement. Later to be world renowned as Joseph Pulitzer, he syringed a new strength to stagnating journalism with his innovative New York World. Pulitzer was the pioneer who called for training of journalists at the university level in a school of journalism. And he bequeathed a lasting legacy: Pulitzer Prize, known widely across the world, awarded on journalism, literature, music and drama.
When he prepared his last will in 1904, Joseph Pulitzer was attentive to four sections of journalism, four in drama, education plus five travelling scholarships. At the outset, three scholarships were awarded on the recommendation of the Faculty of Journalism at Columbia to graduating students, while the remainder were awarded on the recommendation of faculty from the Columbia Department of Music and the Institute of Musical Art (music) and the National Academy of Design (art).
On March 27, scores of journalists, novelists, poets, playwrights and musicians gathered at Michaels in midtown Manhattan to celebrate the Pulitzers next 100 years. With only a few days to go until the announcement of the 102nd class of winners, Canedy, Pulitzer Prize Board Chair Eugene Robinson and Columbia University President Lee Bollinger offered probing analyses of the state of journalism and the First Amendment in 2018.
In journalism, the Pulitzer Prize recognised the most disinterested and meritorious public service rendered by any American newspaper during the preceding year (a gold medal worth $500 with no monetary component); the best editorial article written during the year, the test of excellence being clearness of style, moral purpose, sound reasoning, and power to influence public opinion in the right direction ($500); and the best example of a reporters work during the year, the test being strict accuracy, terseness, the accomplishment of some public good commanding public attention and respect ($1,000). (A $1,000 prize for the best history of services rendered to the public by the American press in the preceding year was only awarded once; similarly, a $1,000 prize for a paper on the development of the School of Journalism was never awarded due to a dearth of competitors.) In letters, prizes were to go to an American novel ($1,000), an original American play performed in New York ($1,000), a book on the history of the United States ($2,000) and an American biography ($1,000).
Standards of excellence
Yet, sensitive to the dynamic progression of his society, Pulitzer made provision for broad changes in the system of awards. He established an overseer advisory board and willed it power in its discretion to suspend or to change any subject or subjects, substituting, however, others in their places, if in the judgment of the board such suspension, changes, or substitutions shall be conducive to the public good or rendered advisable by public necessities, or by reason of change of time. He also empowered the board to withhold any award where entries fell below its standards of excellence. The assignment of power to the board was such that it could also overrule the recommendations for awards made by the juries subsequently set up in each of the categories.
Thus, the Plan of Award, which has governed the prizes since their inception in 1917, has been revised frequently. The Board, later renamed the Pulitzer Prize Board, has increased the number of awards to 21 and introduced poetry, music, and photography as subjects, while adhering to the spirit of the founders will and its intent.
The board typically exercised its broad discretion in 1997, the 150th anniversary of Pulitzers birth, in two fundamental respects. It took a significant step in recognition of the growing importance of work being done by newspapers in online journalism. Beginning with the 1999 competition, the board sanctioned the submission by newspapers of online presentations as supplements to print exhibits in the Public Service category. The board left open the distinct possibility of further inclusions in the Pulitzer process of online journalism as the electronic medium developed. Thus, with the 2006 competition, the Board allowed online content in all 14 of its journalism categories. For 2009, the competition was expanded to include online-only news organizations. For 2011, the Plan of Award was revised to encourage more explicitly the entry of online and multimedia material, with the board seeking to honor the best work in whatever form is the most effective. And for 2012, the board adopted an all-digital entry and judging system, replacing the historic reliance on submission of scrapbooks.
Classical choice
Bill Bealls 1957 photo of a young boy and a policeman captured a moment of childhood innocence and wonder, and won the Pulitzer Prize.
The other major change was in music, a category that was added to the Plan of Award for prizes in 1943. The prize always had gone to composers of classical music. The definition and entry requirements of the music category beginning with the 1998 competition were broadened to attract a wider range of American music. In an indication of the trend toward bringing mainstream music into the Pulitzer process, the 1997 prize went to Wynton Marsaliss Blood on the Fields, which has strong jazz elements, the first such award. In music, the board also took tacit note of the criticism leveled at its predecessors for failure to cite two of the countrys foremost jazz composers. It bestowed a Special Citation on George Gershwin marking the 1998 centennial celebration of his birth and Duke Ellington on his 1999 centennial year. In 2004, the Board further broadened the definition of the prize and the makeup of its music juries, resulting in a greater diversity of entries. In 2007, the music prize went to Ornette Coleman for Sound Grammar, the first live jazz recording to win the award. The Board also awarded posthumous Special Citations to jazz composers Thelonious Monk in 2006 and John Coltrane in 2007.
Only U.S. citizens are eligible to apply for the Prizes in Letters, Drama and Music (with the exception of the History category in Letters where the book must be a history of the United States but the author may be of any nationality). For the Journalism competition, entrants may be of any nationality but work must have appeared in U.S. newspaper, magazine or news site that publishes regularly.

Brendon Kuruppu
With a lot of persuasion I managed to get hold of Brendon Kuruppu for an interview at the Bloomfield pavilion, his appearance belied his age, smartly dressed, still looking good enough to don pads for Sri Lanka both as an opener and wicket-keeper.
Whilst talking about pads, the readers should note the following: Brendon made his debut in an ODI against Australia in 1983, Greg Chappell was the captain of Australia, Brendon was in his element that day whacking Bruce Yardley over midwicket for two mighty sixes, and he was equally harsh on Dennis Lillee and Rodney Hogg. He ended up unbeaten on 72 and Greg Chappell was so impressed by Brendons knock that he gave his own set of pads to Brendon which he cherishes to this day.
Getting back on track Brendon, the gentleman that he is and modest to fault. I found it difficult to extricate some of his views on cricket in some instances, during his era. Was it frustration or was he keeping to his norms as a gentleman cricketer One wonders!
Brendon stated that he played Test cricket from 1987 to 1991, those were the days that Test were few and far between (these days Test fixtures are so saturated and as a result it has taken the lustre out of the noble game, I really feel that we need squads of about 50 to 70 to sustain match-winning performances from the players. Its the money that matters, even during live broadcasts they show snippets of some highlights on a previous match, which to me is annoying and this to me is hard on the connoisseurs, we simply cannot absorb the beauty of a well timed hit or the sheer class of an in-dipping yorker will it be like baseball or is it the Indianisation of cricket!)
Back on the groove again, I have already written about Brendons epic double hundred in 2017 July in this column and hence I need not harp on that any more. During that period of 1987 to 1991 Brendon pointed out that he was an automatic choice as a dashing opening bat cum wicket keeper.
According to Brendon the best bowler he faced was Sir Richard Hadlee, being an opener he must have got the full brunt of Hadlee, who according to Brendon was a class apart on the green seaming wickets where he seamed the ball in or out at will or in other words  let the ball talk. On batting friendly wickets he swung the ball late at will, and had change of pace, to cap it all Brendon insisted that all this assortments of deliveries were sent without a hint of change in action.
This came from the horses mouth since he got that double hundred at the CCC against Hadlee and Co. I can still recall that Brendon was lucky to get an lbw decision in his favour against late Martin Crow, who was so annoyed that he bowled a thundering beamer to Brendon who managed to weave his head away.
Ashantha de Mel came for high praise from Brendon due to his late outswing at brisk pace. He also mentioned that in that era the only noteworthy spinner was Don Anurasiri - his line and length was good all the time although he was no Ajith de Silva when it came to sharp turn.The other left-arm spinner who was in the fray at that time was Roger Wijesuriya who was rather mediocre in comparison to Test level. Brendon also recalled that tall Ranjith Madurasinghe was a useful off spinner.
Amongst the batters according to Brendon, Sir Viv Richards took pride of place. In the 1987 World Cup Sri Lanka played against the Windies and Viv Richards came to the wicket when Gordon Greenidge and Richie Richardson were back in the hatch in next to no time. Brendon watched the proceedings at close quarters from behind the wickets, Richards at first started sedately consolidating with Desmond Haynes whose defence as we know was water tight. Once Richards got his eye in, he picked Don Anurasiri who was bowling accurately till then slammed him for four consecutive sixes through mid off, cover, mid-on and mid-wicket, he was well set by then and there was no stopping him stated Brendon. Towards the end of his mammoth innings of 189, he was hitting sixes at will the ball sailing about 40 meters from the boundary line. Brendon noted that it was sheer power, timing and good balance. He was full of praise for Abdul Qadirs fastish leg spin, googly and flippers.
Brendon retired from international cricket in 1991 at the young age of 27 years! I inquired from him why he retired at a comparatively young age. Brendon didnt say anything but the expression in his face said it all. Romesh Kaluwitharana was drafted in as the new wicket-keeper. Brendon opted to coaching and begun the Brendon School of cricket. Brendon is also the international tournament director at Red Bull, from 2012 to-date.
When asked about his comments on the recently concluded Nidahas trophy, Brendon was of the view that the team blended well, however he pointed out that our bowlers should be trained to bowl on the spot on good batting tracks. He noted that during the last 2 to 3 years there has been constant changes in the team thereby players never had time to settle down.
Brendon was the team manager for the national team on several different occasions and he picked out Mahela Jayawardene as one of the best skippers who stood by his decisions without wavering. In his tenor as the cricket manager, he managed all the top Sri Lankan cricketers at the time.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 22
Celebrate small wins that  promote consistent progress and build commitment
Kouzes and Posner write in their classic leadership book, The Challenge of Leadership, Jossey Bass, that through their research of over 60,000 leaders across continents, they have uncovered five practices and ten commitments of excellent leaders. We have already discussed the five practices and went through in detail the first six of the ten commitments.
Today we go through the balance four.
7. Set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with shared values.
Exemplary leaders engage in practices that stand the test of time, the first being that they model the way. They clarify their personal values and then express those values in their own style and voice, in thought and action. They then set the example by aligning their personal actions with shared values.
Leaders understand that values cannot be imposed from the top. They must be forged. Being clear about personal values allows us to detect where there are shared values in the community.
Discovering values that can be shared is the foundation for building productivity and genuine working relationships. Although leaders honour the diversity of their team members, they also stress their common values. Leaders build on agreement.
Tremendous energy is generated when individual and group values are aligned. Commitment, enthusiasm, and drive are intensified, as people have reasons for caring about their work. When we care about what we are doing, we are more effective and satisfied. We experience less stress.
The most powerful thing a leader can do to mobilize others is to set the example by aligning personal actions with shared values. Leaders show up, pay attention, and participate directly in getting extraordinary things done. They show others by their own example that they are deeply committed to the values and aspirations they espouse. Leaders are measured by the consistency of their deeds and wordsby walking the talk. Leading by example is how leaders make visions and values tangible. It is how they provide the evidence that they are committed and competent.
Leaders enact the meaning of the organization in every decision they make and in every step they take. Leaders understand that they bring shared values to life in a variety of settingsin staff meetings, one-on-one conferences, telephone calls, e-mails, sermons, and in visits with colleagues and constituents.
How you spend your time is the single clearest indicator, especially to other people, about whats important to you. Critical incidents chance occurrences, particularly at a time of stress and challenge, offer significant moments of learning for leaders. They are often the most dramatic sources of moral lessons about what we should value and how we should behave. They become stories that are passed down in the workplace.
8. Achieve small wins that promote consistent progress and build commitment
The power of progress is fundamental to human nature, but few managers understand it or know how to leverage progress to boost motivation. In fact, work motivation has been a subject of long-standing debate. In a survey asking about the keys to motivating workers, we found that some managers ranked recognition for good work as most important, while others put more stock in tangible incentives. Some focused on the value of interpersonal support, while still others thought clear goals were the answer. Interestingly, very few of our surveyed managers ranked progress first
When we think about progress, we often imagine how good it feels to achieve a long-term goal or experience a major breakthrough. These big wins are greatbut they are relatively rare. The good news is that even small wins can boost inner work life tremendously.
Many of the progress events represent only minor steps forward. Yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions. Consider this diary entry from a programmer in a high-tech company, which was accompanied by very positive self-ratings of her emotions, motivations, and perceptions that day: I figured out why something was not working correctly. I felt relieved and happy because this was a minor milestone for me.
Even ordinary, incremental progress can increase peoples engagement in the work and their happiness during the workday. Across all types of events, a notable proportion of incidents that had a minor impact on the project had a major impact on peoples feelings about it. Because inner work life has such a potent effect on creativity and productivity, and because small but consistent steps forward, shared by many people, can accumulate into excellent execution, progress events that often go unnoticed are critical to the overall performance of organizations.
If you are a leader, the progress principle holds clear implications for where to focus your efforts. It suggests that you have more influence than you may realize over your team members well-being, motivation, and creative output. Knowing what serves to catalyse and nourish progress - and what does the opposite - turns out to be the key to effectively managing people and their work.
9. Recognize individual contributions to the success of every effort.
Retaining quality employees can be a challenge. High turnover not only affects morale, but your companys bottom line will take a hit too. Its incredibly inefficient to train new people or get them up to speed. It taxes existing staff, and theres an obvious cost in time and money of procuring new people.
So how do you motivate existing employees and keep them hungry and passionate without necessarily giving them substantial pay increases or bonuses How do you increase employee engagement, and more importantly, loyalty
You should never underestimate the power inherent in executive recognition. Its a potent weapon in your motivation arsenal, provided its used in moderation and at the right time.
When an executive recognizes exceptional effort or rare achievement, its value is increased. A simple thing such as a company-wide email acknowledgment or shout-out in a meeting will go a long way. And if you add a personal call or shake hands to express your appreciation to the employee, youll be surprised how much motivational currency that will create.
You may not necessary need to give away plaques like we do  especially if your employees are remote. The key is the find creative ways that work for your company. Find something that serves as a constant reminder of their achievement that has longevity beyond just the day it is bestowed.
Youre part of a team, but youre an individual too.
While its important to get praise as part of a team that successfully meets goals and quotas, everyone needs to be recognized for their individual accomplishments by the people around them  and above them. Anticipating that they will be recognized for completing a task well is strong motivation for an individual to go the extra mile.
Providing positive recognition of an accomplishment serves to raise individual self-esteem, reinforce their value to the organization, improve their self-image and encourage them to accomplish even greater results in the future
Recognition is important, but so are rewards. Praise and recognition for completing tasks have a limited shelf life. At a certain point you have to put your money where your mouth is and give some kind of reward to acknowledge superior results.
While its important to motivate employees, if rewards do not come after extra efforts, your employees will lose their enthusiasm and come to the realization that there is no payoff.Rewards come in all shapes and sizes and can be tangible or intangible. Tangible rewards include such things as a briefcase, a gift certificate, a bonus or a pay increase.
But intangible rewards can be just as effective and cost the company far less. Just doing something as simple as taking the employee out to lunch to celebrate their achievement or give the employee extra time off can have a huge impact.
10. Celebrate team accomplishments regularly.
An organizations success is the sum total of micro-successes that its employees experience each day. It is important to celebrate such workplace successes as it gives employees a sense of purpose, makes them feel valued, and eventually boosts employee morale. Milestone celebrations, both organizational and employee-oriented, should be leveraged as engagement opportunities. Such celebrations should not be considered a perk as these are instrumental in acquiring and retaining talent.
Employees get a sense of purpose when they see how their regular deliverables contribute to organizational success. Getting acknowledged gives them a reason to work harder. In longer term, it helps in retaining talent. Moreover, it creates a culture of appreciation within the organization. Having a robust rewards & recognition policy significantly aids in building a positive culture of appreciation. The policy should be designed in a manner that allows managers to reward and celebrate significant as well as smaller teamaccomplishments.
While it may be important to acknowledge and celebrate achievements, these should essentially be linked to well-defined goals. Regularly celebrating with team members the accomplishment of short and long term goals can be very motivating for them. Spontaneous celebrations with an element of surprise are always received well and create a spirit of camaraderie.
A lot of organizations are strategically partaking in CSR initiatives that align with the theme of important milestone celebrations. Supporting societal causes and engaging employees in related volunteer work can inspire trust of the employees and pitch the organization as a responsible corporate establishment, internally and externally.
Celebrations dont always have to be fancy and expensive. The key is to celebrate smaller achievements regularly to give employees a sense of belonging and appreciation.

Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund opens for local investors
The Ceylon Dollar Bond Fund (CDBF) investing in Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs), Dollar Sovereign and Bank Bonds, is now eligible to accept investments from any local individual or company.
All Personal Foreign Currency Account (PFCA) holders (formerly NRFC, RFC, RNNFC, SFIDA etc.) or Business Foreign Currency Account (BFCA) holders (formerly FEEA, Exporters Foreign Currency Accounts etc.) can now invest in the Fund.
CDBF, the only dollar denominated unit trust in Sri Lanka is approved by the Central Bank.
The fund reported a net return of 6.95% in 2016 and 5.25% in 2017, while the annualised return as at 28 February was 4.34%.
Previously limited to Sri Lankans living or working overseas, BOI companies and foreign investors, the fund is now open to any investor from US$ 1,000 upwards.
Ceylon Asset Management Managing Director, Dulindra Fernando said: CDBF has been able to secure attractive interest rates available on Sri Lankan dollar bonds, influenced by the news of US Federal Reserve raising interest rates and the recent civil unrest in Sri Lanka. Returns on the CDBF have been strong due to the Sri Lankan government engaging in raising dollar funds in both local and international markets.
The Chairman of Ceylon Asset Management, Nilu Wijedasa, commended the CBSL and the SEC for paving the path for Sri Lankan investors to access competitive returns available through CDBF. Further, he noted with approval the replacement of the countrys previous Exchange Control Act, which was succeeded with the new Foreign Exchange Act, legislation which Wijedasa believes has advanced Sri Lankas foreign currency management systems to be on par with international standards.

Changing history for children.!
History is quite a boring subject for children and could get even more boring and confusing as governments throughout the world use their terms in office to rewrite history books, so children will lean towards a particular political party or ideology. Here are a few incidents of slightly confused children:
At Khartoum, capital of Sudan, on the banks of the Nile is Gordon College, named for the famous British General Charles Gordon (1833-1885), who was killed there in 1885 while resisting a siege. In the college garden stands a magnificent statue of Gordon mounted on a camel.
Gordon is pictured in full military dress and the camel is wearing rugs and tassels.
A British civil servant who was stationed at Khartoum for many years used to take his son from time to time to see and admire the general. They would always stand together in silence for a moment looking at the imposing statue.
Finally the time came when the civil servant was to be transferred. Before they left, he took his son for a final visit to Gordon. As they turned away, the fathers eyes moist with tears, his son looked up at him and said, Tell me father, Ive always wondered; who is that funny man sitting on Gordon
And heres another: A fifth grade class was practicing for the schools annual Thanksgiving pageant. The teacher wanted to make sure the meaning of it all was clear, so she asked them a few questions on history, Now boys and girls, who can tell us why the Pilgrims came to America
A boy raised his hand, when called upon, confidently declared, So they could worship in their own way and make other people worship in the same way!
Now wasnt that close
And as children go on getting brain washed with history they tend to get a little numb as this teacher found out: What did the pilgrims find in America she asked and a child either dull or very clever penned this reply: The Pilgrims found land that was hilly and stony. Some places it was stony and hilly. The stones were useful for making millstones and milestones. The Indians sharpened them. They used the stones for scalping and other social purposes! The hills were useful to climb and watch Indians from. The Indians sometimes got there first, then the hills were useless! The winters in America were long. The summers were short. In keeping with the seasons, long underwear was worn in the winter. They wore short underwear in the summer!
Im sure that child could have continued to write pages and pages of historical nonsense!
And as world leaders especially in India, tamper with history we may also see the day when our children confused and bored, pen silly answers such as these or look up at equestrian statue of rider and horse, admire steed but wonder who sits astride..!

Child rights awareness campaign to be launched
The National Child Protection Authority is preparing to launch an awareness campaign about the UN declaration of Child Rights. The Child Rights Authority had noticed the awareness level of the rural children on child rights are low and the Authority plans to launch this campaign to elevate the level of awareness of the children, said Marini De Silva, the chairman of the Child Authority in a media statement.
This campaign aims to educate the children about their rights in a broader scale which would give them an opportunity to use the knowledge for their future wellness. The Universal declaration on child rights was passed in the year 1989 and Sri Lanka agreed to the declaration in 1990. Therefore, Sri Lanka must protect and uphold all of the statements in the charter, the statement further said.
A simpler version of the declaration had been created and the Authority expects to elevate the awareness levels of children living in rural areas.
The first phase of the project is to be carried out in the Western province as a pilot project. The Child Protection Authority is ready to take any and every action necessary against a breach on the declaration and urges the public to notify the Authority via calling 1929 or informing the nearby police station.

## Title: CHINAS STEADFAST FRIENDSHIP
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, April 3, 2018 - 01:00
CHINAS STEADFAST FRIENDSHIP
Sino-Lankan relations are on the threshold of a transformative leap forward. Contacts between Sri Lanka and the Middle Kingdom go back several centuries to the visits by the monk/scholar Fa Hsien and the impressive naval fleet of Admiral Zheng He. In the post-colonial era, the historic Rubber-Rice Pact (1952) was the landmark that initiated the very cordial relations that have prevailed between the two countries during the subsequent decades. China has been a steadfast friend which has played a very important role in protecting the unity and territorial integrity of the country.
Chinas massive role in infrastructure development
Since the end of the conflict in 2009, China has been the lead player in assisting Sri Lankas unprecedented accelerated infrastructure development programme. Chinese funding have, inter alia, supported the development of the Norochcholai Power Plant, the Hambantota Port, Mattala Airport and the road development programme (including Katunayake  Colombo Highway, a part of the Southern Highway and the Northern Road Rehabilitation Project).
The significant backlog of infrastructure development that has plagued the country for several decades could not have been addressed so expeditiously without Chinese funding and technical assistance. While there is a debate to be had in terms of the current rates of return on some of these projects and the opportunity cost involved, the fact is that these critically important assets have been created and the conditions have been generated to strengthen the growth framework of the economy is highly commendable.
China has provided assistance to the tune of US$5.8 billion, since 2005. Of this 84% have been commercial loans from the EXIM Bank (69%) and China Development Bank (15%). As Sri Lankas headroom for additional commercial debt becomes more constrained, China has shifted its focus to FDI (equity). Already, China Merchant has an 85% stake in the Colombo North Port Development.
During the Presidents recent visit to China, it was also announced that China Harbour would invest in the Colombo-Kandy- North Highway. This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg. China seems to have identified Sri Lanka as a strategic destination for the Chinese investment. This has also paved the way for large scale implementation of Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) for infrastructure development in Sri Lanka.
The stage is set for a great leap forward
There are a number of factors that are currently working in favour of a great leap forward in Sino-Lankan economic relations.
 The excellent political relations between the two countries provide a robust foundation for stronger economic ties.
 China has expressed concern at the highest level about Sri Lankas large deficit in the bilateral trade between the two countries. Sri Lankas exports to China amount to US$ 976 million (2012) while imports from China were $3.2 billion. This has provided the impetus for the much-needed bilateral FTA which is expected to be completed before the end of 2013.
 The FTA is likely to provide preferential access for traditional Sri Lankan exports, such as apparel and tea, as well as for other nontraditional goods and services. The Chinese Ambassador was recently quoted as saying that Sri Lanka should focus on higher value manufactured exports into the Chinese markets.
 The proposed market opening through the FTA is very opportune at a time when Chinas overriding priority is to re-balance its economy from external (exports) to domestic demand. This will create new opportunities for Chinas trading partners, particularly those with preferential access to the enormous Chinese market, including the rapidly rising demand for high value goods.
 The prospects of attracting Chinese FDI to create export capacity to generate competitive supplies to sell into the Chinese market have also been enhanced. The combined effects of the strengthening Yuan; increasing domestic costs, including labour; and the priority attached to diversifying the investment strategy for Chinas massive external reserves have meant that Chinese companies are increasingly seeking to invest abroad. Sri Lanka seems to have been identified as a strategic partner in this connection.
 The combination of all these factors will offer increased opportunities not only for exporting finished goods but also for penetrating the supply chains of Chinese companies.
 Some Chinese companies are also likely to be attracted by the market prospects offered by Sri Lankas FTAs with India and Pakistan.
 The recent decision by the government to create entrepots and bonded areas will further incentivize potential Chinese (and other) investors as this will enable them to avoid some of the macroeconomic and other business environment related constraints that have hindered export development in the country.
 There is considerable potential for growth in Chinese tourists to Sri Lanka. It is expected that there will be a total of 90 million outbound tourists from China in 2013. They have now become the highest tourist spenders in the world. It is encouraging, therefore, that there has already been a 70% increase in Chinese arrivals this year. The ongoing aggressive promotion campaign by the government, the private sector and non-state actors is to be commended and encouraged. The mega tourism projects that are currently being implemented will significantly improve the local tourism infrastructure and increase the attraction of Sri Lanka as a destination for high-end Chinese visitors.
A dosage of realism
A combination of political will and propitious economic factors have created a massive opportunity for a great leap forward in Sino-Lankan economic relations. However, it is important to infuse a note of caution. Geo-political realities cannot be wished away. Sri Lanka is very much within Indias defense perimeter. This is an immutable fact that China also recognizes. It is likely that this message has been communicated at the highest levels. In such a context, Sri Lankas diplomacy and economic relations should be focused on maximizing the benefits from the rise of both Asian giants: China and India.
In this context, it is clear that stronger Sino-Indian relations will be the scope for Sri Lanka to build its bilateral economic relations with China. In this connection, there are grounds for optimism:
 India and China have reset their bilateral relationship. There are regular contacts at the highest levels at the political and defense establishment fronts. Despite tensions that arise from time-to-time, particularly on border issues, bilateral mechanisms are in place to reduce mistrust.
 China and India are also working together on an expanding common agenda within the BRICS framework. This too should serve to create greater trust between the two Asian giants.
 Sino-Indian trade has increased from $1.5 billion in 2000 to $ 50 billion in 2012.
Broader perspective for the future
With the dawn of peace, Sri Lanka has been able to make a remarkable progress in infrastructure which is a necessary condition for sustainable economic development. Role of the Chinese assistance in this regard was the most crucial factor.
The next phase of Chinese assistance, hopefully will also include international marketing of the hard infrastructure already developed, especially seaports, airports and highways making Sri Lanka a regional hub for aviation, shipping and logistics.
What has become possible today would not have been possible five-ten years ago. It would be greatly advantageous to Sri Lanka if Sino-Indian relations continue to improve so that the full potential for a great leap forward in Sino-Lankan relations can be realized.

China slaps retaliatory tariffs on 128 US imports
China on Monday imposed tariffs on 128 US imports worth US$3 billion, including fruits and pork, retaliating for US duties on steel and aluminium that Beijing said "seriously infringed" Chinese interests.
China's move, which the Xinhua news agency said was decided by the custom tariffs commission of the State Council, followed weeks of rhetoric that has raised fears of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.
The Trump administration had said its duties were aimed at steel and aluminium imports that it deemed a threat to US national security, but China's Commerce Ministry on Monday called that reasoning an "abuse" of World Trade Organization (WTO) guidelines.
The US measures "are directed only at a few countries, seriously violating the principle of non-discrimination as a cornerstone of the multilateral trading system, which seriously infringed the interests of the Chinese side," said a statement on the Commerce Ministry website.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly railed against China's massive trade surplus with the United States and promised during the US election campaign to take steps to slash the US deficit.
Beijing had warned last month that it was considering the tariffs of 15 per cent and 25 per cent on a range of products that also include wine, nuts and aluminium scrap. They came into force on Monday, Xinhua said, citing a government statement.
The levies are in response to tariffs of 10 per cent on aluminium and 25 per cent on steel that have also angered US allies.
"We hope that the United States can withdraw measures that violate WTO rules as soon as possible to put trade in the relevant products between China and the US back on a normal track," the Commerce Ministry statement said.
"Cooperation between China and the United States, the world's two largest economies, is the only correct choice."
Trump has temporarily suspended the tariffs for the European Union as well as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea.
But the White House has unveiled plans to impose new tariffs on some $60 billion of Chinese imports over the "theft" of intellectual property.
China has called on the United States to stop its "economic intimidation" and had warned that it was ready to hit back.
But Beijing has so far held fire against major US imports such as soybeans or Boeing aircraft - items that state-run daily the Global Times suggested should be targeted.
The nationalistic newspaper said in an editorial last week that China has "nearly completed its list of retaliatory tariffs on US products and will release it soon."
"The list will involve major Chinese imports from the US," the newspaper wrote, without saying which items were included.
"This will deal a heavy blow to Washington that aggressively wields the stick of trade war and will make the US pay a price for its radical trade policy toward China," the Global Times wrote.
Despite the rhetoric, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Thursday suggested the new measures on intellectual property were a "prelude to a set of negotiations".
The United States ran a US$375.2 billion deficit with China last year.

Chinese space lab plunges back to Earth
CHINA: A defunct Chinese space lab disintegrated under intense heat as it hurtled through Earths atmosphere Monday and plunged towards a watery grave in the South Pacific, Chinese officials said.
The Tiangong-1 mostly burnt up above the vast oceans central region at 8:15 am (0015 GMT), Chinas Manned Space Engineering Office said.
There was no immediate confirmation of the final resting place of any remaining debris, although the South Pacific is largely empty.
Tiangong-1 -- or Heavenly Palace -- was placed in orbit in September 2011, acting as a testing ground for Chinas efforts towards building its own space station by 2022, but it ceased functioning in 2016.
Space officials had promised the atmospheric disintegration would offer a splendid show akin to a meteor shower.
But the remote location likely deprived stargazers of a spectacle of fireballs falling from the sky.
Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, said the module zoomed over Pyongyang and the Japanese city of Kyoto during daylight hours, reducing the odds of seeing it before it hit the Pacific.
It would have been fun for people to see it, but there will be other re-entries, McDowell told AFP. The good thing is that it doesnt cause any damage when it comes down and thats what we like. Space officials had warned that knowing the exact location of the re-entry would not be possible until shortly before it happened.
The difficulties seemed to wrong-foot Chinese space scientists -- just moments before announcing the craft would come down over the Pacific, they had said it would make its re-entry over Sao Paulo, and head towards the Atlantic Ocean.
The US militarys network of radars and sensors also confirmed that the Tiangong-1 had re-entered over the Pacific, but a minute later than the Chinese estimate, according to a statement by the Joint Force Space Component Command.
McDowell said Chinas space agencys initial estimate for re-entry was off because it guessed wrong about the time the space lab would come down from its orbital path.
Thats all that happened, he said, as models used by experts to estimate a re-entry point pick the middle time in a return window.
The European Space Agency had described the probability of someone being hit by a piece of debris from Tiangong-1 as 10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning.
The module -- which was used to practise complicated manual and automatic docking techniques -- was originally intended to be used for just two years, but ended up serving considerably longer.
During its brief lifespan, it hosted Chinese astronauts on several occasions as they performed experiments and even taught a class that was broadcast into schools across the country.
Huang Weifen, deputy chief designer of the Astronaut Center of China, said it played an important role in Chinas space history, providing precious experience for building a space station, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
In an article on a science ministry website, she said the lab marked many firsts for Beijings space programme:The first manual docking of a spacecraft, the first flight by a female astronaut and the first lesson from orbit.
Tiangong-1 had been slated for a controlled re-entry, but ceased functioning in March 2016. Space enthusiasts have been bracing for its return ever since.
The ESA has said ground controllers were no longer able to command Tiangong-1 to fire its on-board engines, which could have been used to determine where it re-entered Earths atmosphere.
In contrast, Russia brought down its massive Mir space station through a controlled re-entry over the Pacific Ocean in 2001. - AFP

Eka Dawasaka Api completes 60 days of screening
The well known film producer who has produced the highest number of movies in the recent past, 16 Movies in just four years - Dr. Arosha Fernandos latest movie production Eka Dawasaka Api successfully completed 60 days of screening in cinemas on April 1. It is directed by the award winning film director Anuruddha Jayasinghe and released on the CEL Film Circuit.
Initially we have never expected the movie to be screened for 50 days or more as most of the movies released recently did not manage to get even close to 30 days. I guess apart from the standard of the movie production and the attraction of the movie to the film lovers, this success was achieved with the support we have received from the CEL Film Circuit, said Dr. Arosha.
We commenced work of the movie only last year in mid April, and got successfully screened in a record time of just 10 months in early February this year. This is the first time a movie was released in just 10 months, Dr. Arosha added.
Dr. Arosha was recently appointed to the board of MPI Film Circuit as a Director after acquiring the shares of veteran film director Sunil Soma Peiris.

Elton John not invited to royal wedding
Sir Elton John has yet to receive an invitation to attend Prince Harrys wedding to Meghan Markle, despite clearing his schedule in anticipation of the big day.
The Rocket Man hitmaker had been personal friends with the grooms late mother, Princess Diana, and he has stayed in touch with both Harry and his big brother William ever since performing at her funeral in 1997.
In February Elton fuelled speculation he would be among the 600 guests celebrating the nuptials at Windsor Castle in England as he cancelled two of his Las Vegas residency shows around the May 19 wedding date, but it appears the singer and his husband David Furnish are still waiting for their official invites, which were mailed out earlier last month.
We havent had an invitation yet, the musician told BBC Radio 2 on March 28
Even if Elton and David miss out on attending the actual ceremony, the rocker plans to take part in the public festivities to mark the wedding in and around the city of Windsor, where they own a home.
I live on a hill (in Windsor), so I could just roll down there, he quipped. Its rolling distance.
During the interview, the singer, who was a guest at Prince Williams 2011 nuptials to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was asked if perhaps he would be performing at Harry and Meghans wedding reception instead, as the post-chapel party is due to be a more intimate affair, with just 200 of the couples loved ones at the nearby Frogmore House.
However, Elton used the opportunity to apparently crack a joke at the Spice Girls expense, after Mel B recently suggested they would be reuniting to perform at the event.
Oh probably, yes, along with Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, Elton quipped in response to the reception question, mockingly adding, I mean the Spice Girls, no ones going to beat them off the stage are they I mean, theyre just huge!
Its not clear why Mel B decided to go public with the royal wedding comments in February bandmates Emma Bunton and Mel C have both since spoken out to dismiss the gossip, claiming Scary Spice was just joking.

England sense chance despite safe start by Latham, Raval
CHRISTCHURCH : England Monday sensed a chance to end their woeful winless run in overseas Tests even though New Zealand will start the final day of the second Test with all 10 wickets still intact.
When bad light ended play 24 overs early in Christchurch, New Zealand were 42 without loss but still 340 runs short of their formidable 382-run target.
Tom Latham was not out 25 and Jeet Raval unbeaten on 17 after surviving a testing 23 overs before play ended more than an hour early.
England batsman-wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow said there were enough signs to believe the tourists run of 12 away matches without a victory could be about to end.
But New Zealand were hopeful of a rare series victory against England if they can at least hang on for a draw after winning the first match in the two-Test series.
Theres definitely enough in the pitch for us to take the wickets, Bairstow said.
Weve beaten the bat consistently. Leachy (spinner Jack Leach) bowled three overs this evening and there were some chances created there. Englands new-ball pair James Anderson and Stuart Broad repeatedly pressured Latham and Raval, with one tough chance off Latham dropped by James Vince at third slip. Bairstow believed that without a shadow of a doubt his team were in charge.
But with 10 wickets in hand, New Zealand batting coach Craig McMillan was eyeing what would be only the fourth series win over England in 36 series -- and the first since 1999.
It would be huge. We love playing England. Series wins have been few and far between for New Zealand Test sides and in terms of history it will be very special, he said praising Latham and Raval for their stubborn start to the innings.
It was really impressive. It was obviously a tough period against two world-class new ball bowlers.
They got examined and tested in different areas but they did a great job to get through. After England declared on 352 for nine, Latham and Raval had some difficult moments in a hostile first-up spell from Anderson and Broad.
Anderson did everything but claim Lathams wicket as the New Zealand opener flirted outside off stump while Broad struck Raval a painful blow in the ribs.
When the New Zealand innings began with a minimum of 137 overs to reach the target, the required run rate was 2.78 per over. When the light ended play early, costing 16 available overs, the run rate was 3.46.
England flourished at the start of the day when they resumed on 202 for three, with Joe Root and Dawid Malan moving the score to 262 before Colin de Grandhomme rallied New Zealand.
He had Malan caught at mid-wicket by Henry Nicholls for 53 to start a tumble that saw six wickets fall for 90 runs before England declared.

She succeeds in finding employment but other than overcoming her own personal handicaps she also has to deal with a pack of 14 scoundrels, the 9F class of the school, which is made up of children from the nearby slum who are rejected by the rest of the student body as well as the teachers. This affects their mentality as they are made to feel that they can never live up to expectations. They mock Nina at every turn. However she does not lose heart and finally manages to win over their trust and friendship.
After a considerable breaking from acting talented Bollywood actress of Black fame Rani Mukerji returns to the screen in a challenging role. The film too is not your typical Bollywood movie as it lacks one of the main ingredients in most Bollywood films: romance.
However Hichki touches the hearts of its viewers due to its freshness of storyline and the fun involved in many of its episodes. There is so much of love and appreciation in Siddharth P Malhotras film that you cannot help shedding a tear and a sigh at the end of the tale. It also encompasses a universal theme that almost all of us can relate to.
Once again Rani leaves us awe struck with her powerful performance. She does not bat an eye lid in carrying off the Tourette Syndrome effected Naina as the illness is something which is quite new to her. We really feel for the energy and the never give up attitude related to the protagonist.
Hichki is screening at Majestic cinema and other film halls islandwide.

GMOA accuses journo of interfering in SLMC polls
A person call himself `a journalist' has made a request to the Health Minister to amend the Medical Ordinance to prevent members of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) from getting elected to the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and to not hold the SLMC election until then, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that this `journalist' is among the persons who were upset after the GMOA members recorded a landslide victory during the previous SLMC election. This person is attached to a foreign NGO and acts according a specific agenda that destroys the entire free health service of the country.
The Medical Ordinance should not be amended according to the requirement of few unqualified and irrelevant persons with hidden agendas.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the other party who is upset is the Health Minister's Public Relations Officer (a doctor).
The latest move is trying to interfere in the SLMC (which is an independent body) through a journalist or using some other tactic. Past similar tactics implemented with the support of the SLMC President were defeated with the majority votes of the SLMC.
The GMOA hopes that the Health Minister will keep his promises made during the recent discussion and will not go against the decisions make by the majority of the SLMC.
Now four GMOA members are in the SLMC after getting elected with several thousands of votes, while others who contested received only few hundreds votes.
Election needs to be held soon for another few vacant seats in the SLMC, he added.

HC grants bail to five persons including former DIG Vass, son
Five persons including former DIG Vass Gunawardena and his son Ravindu Gunawardena, were ordered to be released on bail by Colombo High Court (HC), yesterday, over an alleged incident of possessing firearms.
However, the bail order of this case would not be effective for the five suspects, as they were already on death row for the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam.
The suspects were granted bail following an application made by Counsel Vishwa de Livera Tennekoon.
Tennekoon had prepared an application in support of a petition dated August 7, 2014, by which he sought bail for former DIG Vass Gunawardena and four others in respect of allegedly committing offences under the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979, The Offensive Weapons Act No. 18 of 1966 and the Firearms Ordinance as amended by the Firearms (Amendment) Act No. 22 of 1996.
Counsel for the petitioner former DIG Vass Gunawardenas wife Shamalie Priyadharshani Perera, de Livera Tennekoon brought to the notice of Court, that although an application was made for the aforementioned petition, no order was made in respect of the case as the suspects were convicted and sentenced to death for a connected murder by a Trial-at-Bar.
He submitted inter alia that;
(1) The High Court has the power to make a bail order in relation to the suspects.
(2) Section 2 of the Bail Act No. 30 of 1997 states that the grant of bail is the guiding principle in implementing the Bail Act and that the refusal of bail should be the exception.
(3) Although the suspects are condemned prisoners (pending an Appeal before a five-judge bench in the Supreme Court), the suspects are being produced before the Magistrate in respect of these alleged offences every two weeks, which is a threat to the security of these suspects and also an additional expense on the State.
(4) As per Section 16 of the Bail Act, no person can be detained for more than 12 months in custody and as per Section 17, this period can be extended every three months for an additional year, on the special request of the Attorney General and no person can be held in remand custody for more than two years, as confirmed by Judge Sisira de Abrew in the case of Wickramasinghe vs. AG 2010 (1) SLR 141.
Tennekoon submitted that the suspects had been arrested in or around June, 2013 and that they had been held in remand custody for these alleged offences for over four years. For that reason alone, the suspects should be granted Bail.
(5) A condemned prisoner is not at risk of committing any of the situations mentioned under Section 14 of the Bail Act, which provides the reasons for which court may refuse bail or cancel a subsisting order for release.
He further added that the purpose of bail is to ensure that a suspect/accused is present and available to stand trial at court hearings and that considering the status-quo of the suspects, that they are not at a risk of absconding. Tennekoon informed the court that the said grounds may be considered as exceptional circumstances which entitle his clients to bail.
High Court Judge Lalith Ekanayake agreed with the submissions made by de Livera Tennekoon and granted bail for the suspects. Accordingly, each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs. 10,000 with two sureties of Rs. 200,000.
Six suspects; former DIG Vaas Gunawardena, his son Ravindu Vaas Gunawardena, Sub-inspector Indika Bamunuge, Police Constable (PC) Gamini Sarath Chandra, PC Priyanka Sanjeewa and PC Kelum Ranga, were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court for committing the murder of millionaire businessman Mohamed Shyam in 2013 at Dompe.

Indian Coast Guard Ship Shoor on goodwill visit
The Indian Coast Guard Ship Shoor, which helped the Sri Lankan Navy douse a fire onboard the container carrier MSC Daniela in April 2016, made its first goodwill visit for the year on Friday (30).
This is the first Indian as well as Coast Guard ship to visit Sri Lanka this year. The visit provided training opportunities for 40 members of the Sri Lankan Coast Guard onboard Shoor.
Shoor is a 105 metre Offshore Patrol Vessel commissioned on April 11, 2016. It is Indian built and is fitted with advanced navigation and communication equipment, sensors and machinery.
The features include 30 mm CRN 91 Naval Gun, Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Integrated Machinery Control System (IMCS), Power Management System (PMS) and High Power External Fire Fighting System. The ship is designed to carry one twin-engine, Light Helicopter and five high-speed boats including two QRIBs (Quick Response Boats) for fast boarding operations, search and rescue, law enforcement and maritime patrol. The ship is also capable of carrying pollution response equipment to combat oil spill contamination at sea.
When we were here last year, we were called to douse the fire on a container ship. We fought it day and night, for four days straight as it is difficult to douse a fire on a ship. It just spreads like matchboxes on fire, said Ship Captain B. Murugan, speaking to a group of Sri Lankan journalists taken on a tour of the ship yesterday.
In March this year, Shoor was also called on to douse a fire onboard Singapore flag Merchant Vessel (MV) Maersk Honman - a vessel three times the size of the OPV, 650 miles off Kochi, India.
The Captain said the ship which is capable of pumping 1,000 tons of water per hour to douse a fire, was successful in putting out the metallic fire and managed to save the ship.
The Indian Coast Guards rapid response to firefighting had thus helped it win favour and diplomacy with neighbours in the region and in the future, has the potential to play an important role in increasing maritime cooperation between the two nations, as the role of Coast Guards expand beyond immediate shores to meet threats such as illegal fishing and maritime crime.
Shoor will leave Lankan shores today (3).

Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama, appearing on behalf of the AG, submitted before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, that charges will be filed against Sunil Neththikumara for leveling death threats on Wijitha Wijesuriya.
Lakmini Girihagama further stated that the voice recordings and the mobile phone involved were sent to the government analyst for further investigations.
Earlier, Wijitha Wijesuriya complained to the Bond Commission that Shanil Neththikumara threatened him with death following his sister Anika's controversial testimony before the Commission.
Accordingly, a case was filed against Neththikumara at the Fort Magistrate's Court.
However, later, Neththikumara had also lodged a counter complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police against Wijith Wijesuriya for leveling death threats on him.
The Senior State Counsel, today, pleaded with the Chief Magistrate's Court to suspend the Magisterial inquiry without taking actions against Wijith Wijeysuriya as the complaint made by Neththikumara to the police was allegedly false.

The seminar was held at the auditorium of the OPA headquarters in Colombo which was filled to capacity by the professionals representing OPA as well as IPM Sri Lanka.
I am glad that I am talking about essential leadership skills with professionals because professionals can make a critical contribution to the countrys progress at this critical juncture amidst the numerous challenges that we are facing.
"This I believe is the correct forum to be involved in a discussion on leadership. Leadership is the most vastly researched but least understood phenomenon on earth, said Prof. Dharmasiri addressing the professionals. He shared a refreshingly new way of presenting a leader, as a servant, synergist and a strategist with global and local examples.
There are leaders at every layer of an organization and every sphere of life. Leadership is all about taking right decisions at the right time in the right manner achieving right, required results. In different situations, leaders need to adapt and play the role of dealers in hope to take the organization forward, he added.

Isner upsets Zverev to win Miami Open
Miami, Sunday: John Isner finally put an end to his ATP Masters final agony on Sunday, winning the Miami Open for the first time by beating Germany's Alexander Zverev 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 6-4.
The 14th seed had lost his previous three major tour final appearances in 2012, 2013 and 2016 but came back from a set down to beat Zverev in two hours and 29 minutes.
The victory capped a superb tournament for Isner, who endured a difficult start to 2018 which included an early-round exit at Indian Wells in his lead-in to Miami.
"I couldn't have scripted this. I came into this tournament, I won one ATP [World Tour] match all year and was playing very poorly," Isner said. "I won my first match in three sets and that's how tennis goes  you start to gain a little confidence and next thing you know things start to roll your way." Isner is the first US player since Andy Roddick in 2010 to lift the Miami title.
Isner will also reclaim a career high world ranking of ninth after the victory, the 13th title of his career.
"Its up to me now to keep pushing forward," he said. To get over the hump in tournaments like this is a big thing mentally for me.
"We cleared that hurdle this week. I went into every match super fresh and loose. I will be a force if I can continue to play freely."
Both Zverev and Isner were faultless in their service games and the first set predictably went the distance before fourth seed Zverev prevailed when Isner sprayed a backhand wide.
The break, however, finally came for Isner at 4-4 in the second set and when Zverev, who missed the chance to return to number three in the world with this defeat, failed to hold at 5-4 in the third, Isner sealed the best win of his career with an ace.
The German, whose frustrations boiled over when he smashed his racket on the ground after that critical break, proved his billing as one of stars of the future by making his third Masters final and now heads to Spain where Germany play in the quarter-final of the Davis Cup.
"I missed more shots today than I did the whole tournament. I played badly from the baseline but its not easy against John," said Zverev who admitted he will have just one day of practice before taking on the Spaniards in Valencia.
"He always makes it difficult.
"I kind of lost the match myself but I have known him since I was 14 so although I am never happy to lose, I am happy for him that hes won his first Masters."
It was a fitting way for American players to say goodbye to Key Biscayne, home of the Miami Open for the last 32 years, before the move to Hard Rock Stadium next year. Florida born Sloane Stephens won the womens title on Saturday before Isner stepped up to the plate 24 hours later.
"With the atmosphere and the support, it was amazing," said Isner.
"You just can't replicate that and for me to come out the winner in the last men's single match ever here is unique."

Life is a song
DeeZone has been one of the leading and exciting bands in the music scene in Colombo for almost eight years now, boasting a lineup of talented and popular musicians. Melodies met up with DeeZone band leader Damian Wikkramatillake and the guys to discover what the band has to offer in terms of entertainment.
Band Leader and Founder of DeeZone, Damian Wikkramatillake, calls music his life, and so far has had an incredible career. He has been a part of some great bands that have been a part of the music culture in Sri Lanka. It has been one great ride to fame and he is not ready to give up!
Every single member of DeeZone has immense respect for him because of the fact that he has associated with great Sri Lankan musicians in his career and has loads of experience in music entertainment.
Music has been my passion from an early age, I ended up playing for a number of very cool bands. I have many years experience performing with many different bands in Europe. Purple Rain was my main band.
Then I did a stint with Wildfire and Misty. Having been a part of these super bands it came to a point where I had to start my own band before I gave up, said Damian.
A brilliantly talented musician he has associated with the crme of the music industry in Sri Lanka.
Music is my life and I am an ear trained self- taught musician and its awesome to perform and create and share music with fellow musicians. Being able to entertain and make people happy is a bonus. It was an unplanned situation that made me pursue a career in music. My childhood dream was to become a pilot. The goal right now is to have a great band and record an album at some point.
We do cover versions of many different artistes and different styles like Pop, Soft Rock, Rock n Roll, Jazz, Funk and music which ranges from the 60s to 2018, and also the Sinhala classics and the traditional Bailas too said Damian.
Georgy Julian De Silva (Keyboards), has come to where he is because of his hard work and dedication. He was spotted by Damian and they started DeeZone in 2010. Since then he has been a regular feature in the band. Julian is an extremely competent music sound engineer and producer. He has produced a number of 1# hit singles in Sinhala and English.
I do what I do because of my love for music. Even at school I studied and performed music with my friends and formed some bands. I had a liking for many musical instruments from a young age. Damian guided me through the years. We are successful I think because of the quality of our sound and Damians repertoire. He is a well- rounded and experienced musician and he has taught us and is guiding us. We are extremely adaptable, said De Silva.
Natural talent
De Silva pointed out that their strength is their camaraderie. This combined with their natural talent has opened up a lot of opportunities for them.
We treat each other as equals and that respect is there and our unity is the key to our success. We cover Ed Sheeran, Cold Play, Justin Timberlake and Pitbull. With our repertoire the audience always has something to enjoy, and that is every single member of our audience. I believe we have the versatility because we even cover the oldies like Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra, 70s, Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and theres so much more!
And I think to succeed in the music scene, you need to practice hard and listen to the right music, said De Silva.
Guitarist Andrew Obeyesekere is no stranger to the music scene in Colombo having been a prominent and founding member of the rock/heavy metal group Stigmata. He simply says music is something you are born to do. In his words a turtle that hatches instinctively turns to the sea. It is something like that with music.
I joined the band last year and the band is about seven years old. The band has performed at many prominent gigs and has had many overseas tours. We do dances and weddings other than playing at night clubs in Colombo. I already did a U.S. tour with DeeZone last year. When I left Stigmata after 17 years, Damian asked me whether I would like to be part of DeeZone. So I simply took up the challenge although this is totally a new thing for me. I am learning new stuff and new styles every day! So I am just enjoying it! We are focused on modern pop, rock and jazz songs. I was excited to do something outside my comfort zone which was why I joined DeeZone, said Obeyesekere.
Obeyesekere said their strength is teamwork which is the key ingredient to success.
With Damian it is a totally new ball game that I am learning with this band. As a unit we are very focused. The line- up is new but we are a good team. We are one of the bands growing in demand in the music scene today pointed out Obeyesekere.
Obeyesekere said one mistake he made over the years was restricting himself to one genre of music. Now he has a more open mind with all that he has learnt during the past year.
Shivanka Abeyrathne (Bass) credits their success to the chemistry between all the band members.
It has been seven months since I joined the band. I have played in other bands. I have been in the field now for almost five years. I used to work in a company which subsequently closed down, but even then I was doing music. I applied for other jobs but never really found one, and it was then that I decided to commit myself to music full time. There is a great team spirit within DeeZone and that is one reason we are so successful. We practice a lot till we get a perfect version of the song. We are all determined to do our best and try to put out a really classy performance. Damian is an inspiration as he is very experienced. He has really great ideas.
Unique insight
My expectations are to continue with this band and progress. We have a wide repertoire that covers a variety of songs, said Abeyrathne.
He also commented that one thing he values about being in this band is the freedom he gets out of it. He enjoys this to the maximum.
Drummer Dharshana Jayamanne, said his experience in the Navy gave him a unique insight into the fundamentals of music.
I have been in the Sri Lankan Navy Band where I learnt the basics about music. I listened to a lot of music so that too has helped me. My passion for music can be traced to my school days. We like to also give our own take or interpretation of the music.
My advice to anyone who wants to enter the music industry is to learn about music. Take your time to get familiar with music. Take time to really connect with music. I have a good thing going on with the band so I want to continue with the band, said Jayamanne.
All band members agreed that there has to be a closer relationship in the musical fraternity in the country, and that there has to be unity amongst musicians not only within their bands but amongst each of the bands as well.
DeeZone performs on Wednesdays at Long Bar Waters Edge, Fridays at Curve and Saturdays at Magarita Blue (Hotel Galadari).

Maj. Gen. Karunasekara barred from foreign travels
Mount Lavinia Additional Magistrate Lochana Abeywickrama cancelled the permission granted to the former Army Chief of Staff and Commandant of the Defence Services Command and Staff College Major General, Amal Karunasekara, to travel to India, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) told the Daily News.
The CID had informed court that Karunasekara could be named as a suspect in the abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyhr and the Court had ordered his foreign travel be suspended.
While court had banned him from overseas travel, he was appointed to the post of the Commandant of the Defence Services Command and Staff College, and he was scheduled to attend a tour of the College in India from April 1 to 7.
Major General Amal Karunasekara, meanwhile, had made an application to court to lift his travel ban, which was granted.
CID sources conducting the investigation told Daily News that a motion was filed by the CID on April 1 seeking a court order to re-impose the travel ban order.
The CID had informed court that they had discussed the matter with the Defence Secretary. He had told the CID that he was unaware that a travel ban had been imposed on the Major General. He had told the CID that he had not nominated Major General Amal Karunasekara for the tour, and that it had been done by the Army.
The case was called again yesterday (2), and the Army notified court that the foreign travel accorded to Major General Amal Karunasekara had been cancelled. Court cancelled the permission previously granted to him and reimposed his travel ban.
The CID said that the court had ordered Major General Amal Karunasekara to give a statement to the CID on April 5.

Moragahakanda Mahaweli Development Project: An answer to many a prayer
We live on a parched planet. Despite being an island surrounded on all sides by water, our water woes are far from over. For those farmers living in the Vanni, raiding whats left of groundwater, or to those in the North Central Province without drinking water, every drop counts. As policymakers fret over empty tanks, dry lakes and thirsty towns, a new structure is silently taking shape.
It is the last and biggest reservoir of the multipurpose Mahaweli Project; the massive Moragahakanda Mahaweli Development Project will be four times the size of the Parakrama Samudraya and is expected to be the answer to many prayers. The project once completed will irrigate parched dry lands in faraway Vanni in the Northern Province on one side, and Rajarata, Wayamba, and the Central and Eastern Provinces, on the other.
Sticking to deadline
Public Relations officer G.G. Dayananda who spoke to the Daily News has lost count of just how many cities or acres of lands would benefit from the project. At this point, keeping track of the numbers is not what makes him or the residents restless; it is how many days away they are from the big opening day.
The people from the Central and North Central Provinces still grapple with water woes; the lack of irrigation has turned paddy fields into parched, barren lands, he said, his face forlorn.
People have been asking for this project, wanting it to see the light of day. There will be four irrigation systems; 24 villages nearby bordering the Kalu Ganga Reservoir and nearly 3,000 families along the Kalu Ganga river valley would directly benefit from this. Sixteen tanks have been constructed; now this structure has to take shape.
He explained that when water was released from all these reservoirs, it could be used for cultivation during both the Yala and Maha seasons. There wasnt sufficient water in the Kaudulla, Giritale, Minneriya and Kantale Reservoirs. But today the reservoirs are filling up.
Detailing the water channels, he added that the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga projects would provide water for 2,000 large and small tanks in the North Central Province, 303 tanks in the North Eastern and Eastern Provinces and 1,600 tanks in the North Western Province. In addition, 48 new tanks in Laggala and Medirigiriya villages are to be built.
Filling up the tanks
The Divisional Irrigation Engineer Asela Udayanga added that the Parakrama Samudrayas water capacity was 116,000 acre feet. Currently, water is released for cultivation during the Maha season. The farmers have requested us to give another months worth of supply this month, he says. Now we can readily and willingly do so.
Through this development project, the government has saved Rs. 10,000 million.
The project will irrigate 94,500 hectares of lands for cultivation during the Yala and Maha Seasons to enhance the rural economy.
Water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir will be primarily used to support agricultural needs in the area and will give economic benefits to 1.5 million families as well as supply clean drinking water around the area.
The Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga Reservoirs will also be able to supply water for the Ihala Alahara project which in turn will irrigate nearly 82,000 hectares of lands and the North-West Alahara project.
Earlier this year, President Maithripala Sirisena unveiled the commemorative plaque at the Moragahakanda Irrigation Project. The project was officially handed over to the government of Sri Lanka by Sinohydro China Construction Company.
The water capacity of the Moragahakanda Reservoir stands at about 460,000 acre feet and today the water limit is at a depth of 330,000 acre feet, said Director of the Kalu Ganga Project D.B. Wijayarathne. The Kalu Ganga dam construction will be completed this year and thereafter, the next step would be to provide water supply to the Anuradhapura townships in 2021, he added.
The third phase would be to supply water to Iranamadu. The total project cost is Rs. 18,100 million. However, the economic benefits include the inclusion of 25 megawatts of electricity to the national grid and the provision of irrigation water to 87,000 farmers in the Matale, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts.
Head of the Minneriya Irrigation Department Engineer Anjana Abeysinghe explained that many parts of Polonnaruwa had experienced flash floods in recent times. However, with the completion of the Moragahakanda Reservoir, we have been able to save and store that water.
Water from the Moragahakanda Reservoir could be provided to the Giritale, Kaudulla, Minneriya and Kantale tanks.
Twenty-thousand acres of land is being cultivated and a 40 km road is being constructed from Medirigiriya to Kantale under this project. A 200-acre industrial zone will also be constructed and 3,000 families will be resettled near the Laggala Reservoir in Laggala.
Sixteen new water tanks will be developed for agriculture. Two additional cities will be developed and 400 industrial cities will be built in the Laggala area, he said.
The annual rainfall that will feed the Moragahakanda Reservoir is 818 million cubic metres. This project will also help minimise the occurrence of floods in the Manampitiya and Somawathiya areas and has direct economic value for thousands of farmer families in three provinces.

Morkel stars in final Test as  South Africa close on victory
Johannesburg: A heavily-strapped Morne Morkel made two breakthroughs as South Africa pushed for victory on the fourth day of the fourth Test against Australia at the Wanderers Stadium on Monday.
Australia, set an impossible 612 to win, were 88 for three when bad light ended play.
The tall Morkel, playing in his final Test before retirement, dismissed both opening batsmen in an impressive eight-over spell. South Africa delayed their second-innings declaration until tea, with a team spokesperson citing concerns about injuries to all three of their fast bowlers.

The main worry appeared to be the fitness of Morkel, who left the field and was unable to complete an over on Sunday with what was described as a side strain.
But a later diagnosis was that the problem was a less severe abdominal strain.
Morkel, with extensive strapping around his midriff, came on to bowl as second change and with his tenth ball trapped Matt Renshaw leg before wicket with a full-length delivery angled in to the left-hander.
Left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj also won a leg before decision, when Usman Khawaja played no shot to a ball which spun sharply out of the rough, before Morkel struck again when Joe Burns played across a ball of almost yorker length.
Burns, one of three replacements for the Australian trio banned for their role in a ball-tampering scandal, made 42 off 84 balls with five fours and a six.
South Africas other fast bowlers, Kagiso Rabada and Vernon Philander, were struggling with a stiff lower back and a groin strain respectively. They both bowled short spells with the new ball.
Captain Faf du Plessis hit 120 and Dean Elgar made 81 before South Africa declared at 344 for six. They shared a fourth-wicket partnership of 170, the best for any wicket by either side during the series.
With South Africa leading the series 2-1, their batting effort made sure they would secure their first home series win against Australia since 1969/70, whether or not their bowling options were limited.
Du Plessis made his first major contribution of the series after scoring only 55 runs in his first seven innings.
When he was on 43, he needed lengthy treatment after a ball from Pat Cummins split open the right index finger he broke earlier in the season.
But he went on to make his eighth Test century and his third against Australia. He faced 178 balls in his innings, which included 18 fours and two sixes.
Cummins was again Australias best bowler, taking four for 58. His match figures of nine for 141 were the best of his career. AFP

National Audit Bill included in Order Paper
The National Audit Bill has been included in the Order Paper, pending its presentation to Parliament today.
The bill was published in the Gazette on March 16. It provides for the powers, duties and functions of the Audit Service Commission and the establishment of the National Audit Office and the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. It specifies the role of the Auditor General over public finance.
The bill was gazetted incorporating the amendments proposed by the Cabinet sub-committee headed by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama. As per the gazetted bill, the powers of surcharge had been vested under chief accounting officers (ministry secretaries and departmental heads).
The officers would impose the surcharge against any person found responsible for deficiency or loss, either jointly or severally followed by a formal disciplinary action by the Disciplinary Authority, or through a judicial process.
The Audit Service Commission shall report the amount of any deficiency or loss in any transaction of an auditee entity if it has been made contrary to any written law and has caused any deficiency or loss due to fraud, negligence, misappropriation or corruption of those involved, the bill stated.
A Surcharge Appeal Committee comprising of five members would be appointed by the Constitutional Council, to hear and determine appeals by any person against whom a surcharge had been imposed.
The bill states that the Auditor General should not be a member of the Committee. Several organisations including Transparency International Sri Lanka, had already raised concerns over dilution of the bill, especially with regard to the surcharge provisions.
The National Audit Bill was a key pre-election pledge of Common Candidate President Maithripala Sirisena, that was also included in the 100-day work programme of the government.
The final draft of the bill was revised over 23 times, mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision.

Minister Samaraweera expressed his confidence that a majority in Parliament will stand with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to defeat the no confidence motion (NCM) against him. Referring to the no-confidence motion as yet another storm in the tea cup, Minister Samaraweera said that the country should not be dragged back to the darkness it was in, from its journey towards a brighter future.
The UNP has taken a decision to unanimously rally around PM Wickremesinghe to defeat the NCM. Minister Samaraweera said: I am not aware of the JVPs opinion on this. However I believe they are not ready to return to the corrupt regime we had earlier. I am sure that the Tamil National Alliance despises the ethno racist approach taken up by the previous regime. Thus, I believe all these parties will want to defeat the NCM, he said.
Minister Samaraweera made these observations at a special interview held at his official residence yesterday morning.
Minister Samaraweera observed that individuals, who toil for the Rajapaksa backed NCM, are the persons who are frightened by the governments slow but sure approach in rounding up the culprits responsible for many crimes and corruption prior to 2015. He further observed that their prime target has become Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is dedicated to the present coalition government.
Speaking further Minister Samaraweera pointed out that the NCM is a part of the larger movement against Yahapalana government, launched by the very people who were involved in crime and corruption with the blessings of the Rajapaksa rule. On January 8, 2015 the Yahapalanaya government began a new journey championing democracy, development and reconciliation. But the persons, who were prospering under the previous corrupt regime, started scheming against the new government. They come up with all sorts of strategies to bring this government down, The Minister added.
The Minister also observed that the origin behind the NCM is the same source behind the recent disturbances in Kandy.
Investigations into crime and corruption cases under the previous regime have recorded much progress by now. These crimes and corruption could not have been unearthed for years, but now we are successfully presenting evidence against the culprits involved in these cases. So, these people have become anxious about this progress. They want to come back to power and reestablish the corrupt regime they maintained prior to 2015. The latest strategy to topple the Yahapalana government is this no confidence motion against PM Wickremesinghe. The supporters of the Joint Opposition and the JO minions in the government itself are trying to use this NCM as a backdoor to come to power, Minister Samaraweera pointed out.
Asked on an alleged clash between President Sirisena and the government, Minister Samaraweera completely denied the allegation. There is no clash whatsoever between the President and the government. Representatives of both parties respect President Sirisena very much. He is a pleasant person who lends an ear to everybody. However, President Sirisena is challenged to maintain the balance between several groups in his party. Some people who made indecent remarks on President Sirisena when he was the common candidate later joined this government seeking ministerial portfolios. President Sirisena has to strike a balance as the leader of the SLFP among all these groups who hold different opinions, Minister Samaraweera explained.
Speaking further, Minister Samaraweera said that PM Wickremesinghe should be given the well deserved recognition as the key figure that revived the bankrupt economy taken over by the coalition government. We had trillions of rupees to service debts in the coming years. We paid more than a trillion to service our debts last year. Next year, we have to pay around 4 trillion. We have passed important milestones in our economy thanks to the economic plan launched by PM Wickremesinghe under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, he pointed out. People will reap the benefits of these development initiatives in the coming years, he added.
Minster Samaraweera also observed that PM Wickremesinghe was selfless when extending his fullest support to the common candidate at the 2015 Presidential Election. Samaraweera pointed out that, giant political figures such as former PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike was not willing to give up her privilege to compete in an election by giving an opportunity to a common candidate, as proposed at the 1988 Presidential election.
Referring to the allegations on the Treasury Bond issue, Minister Samaraweera pointed out that the government has taken all necessary steps to recover the loss incurred by the questionable bond sale. We have frozen the accounts of all perpetrators of the bond issue, so that we can recover every penny. It was Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who first called for an investigation on this issue. If we followed the steps of corrupt Rajapaksa regime, we would have appointed a henchman of our government as the Chairman of the COPE committee. Premier Wickremesinghe also bowed down to the Presidential Commission appointed to look into the Treasury bond issue. He even volunteered to give evidence before the Commission. There have been trillions lost in bond scams under the purview of the previous regime. Now they are bringing in a NCM against the PM who introduced a system to apprehend these scammers and curb corruption in the relevant institutions, Minister Samaraweera also said.
Asked on criticisms against the present government, Minister Samaraweera agreed that there have been several criticisms leveled against the government. He said, that the government will take all measures to deal with these criticisms.
In all honesty, the main criticism against the present government is that we isolated the forces that brought us into power. We are criticized for sliding away from the policies we were supposed to implement. Even though Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna recorded a victory at the recent Local Government Election, they cannot obtain a majority at a General Election, Minister Samaraweera said.
The majority of this country is opposed to the previous regime just as much as they were in 2015. However, we are losing their confidence. So the first step following the no confidence motion is to go back to our vote base and provide facilities to our poor innocent citizens. Parallel to such a welfare approach, we need to create an economy that can compete in the global market. We also need to defeat ethno religious tensions created by the same sources that has brought in this NCM. I must agree that the police responded slowly to the tense situation at Kandy recently. We will have to take strict action against incidents such as these in the future to ensure reconciliation among all the ethnicities. We will not allow anybody to drag us back to the corrupt era we were in, Minister Samaraweera further said.
Denying the allegation that the PM is protecting Rajapaksa family, Minister Samaraweera pointed out that the NCM presented to Parliament contains several signatures of Rajapaksa family members who are parliamentarians. If the PM is protecting the Rajapaksas, would they have signed the no confidence motion Minister Samaraweera questioned.
Minister Samaraweera also said that the progress achieved by the government will not be hindered or reversed by the no confidence motion. He pointed out that the government is confident that the NCM will be defeated on Wednesday, hence there will be no such hindrance to the operations of the government.

Nearly 65 pc deaths in SL due to NCDs
Nearly 65 percent of hospital deaths in Sri Lanka is due to Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs), of which nearly 17 percent occur prematurely, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the first annual NCD meeting of the SAARC countries held in Colombo recently, he said with regard to the 10 global targets for NCDs to be achieved by 2025, Sri Lanka has launched a multi-sectoral action plan built on four strategic pillars - advocacy, partnerships, leadership and health promotion.
Underlying these is the reorienting of the health system for early detection and management of NCDs and their risk factors, surveillance and operational research.
According to Minister Senaratne, one of the key initiatives in NCD control is strengthening primary healthcare facilities in the country. Close to 950 Healthy Lifestyle Centers located island-wide linked to MOH offices provide screening for cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and cancers. These and the Well Woman Clinics function as screening centres for NCDs. In the future, the screening centres will be linked with diagnostic facilities, backed up by medical specialists. All centres will be digitized to facilitate the exchange of medical information, record keeping, stock management etc.
We have taken action to reduce the price of essential drugs, some by more than 400 percent, but most by 40 to 100 percent. This is a relief for patients, especially those being treated by private health service providers. We have also lifted the price ceiling on cancer drugs to be provided free at government facilities, said the Minister.
He added: Now the patients can get the best of medication, often costly, free of charge at government facilities. We have also extended similar benefits towards eye care, providing the best quality eye lenses to patients free of charge. Similar packages have been introduced for expensive, urgently needed cardio-thoracic medication including cardiac stents. The process, which has already started, is still being fine-tuned and will be fully operational by 2020.

For a new look police service
Newly appointed Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara wants to overhaul the police service and bring it more closer to the public. Calling on the Viharadhipathy of the of the Kataragama Kiri Vehera Raja Maha Viharaya, over the weekend, the minister said the police service will be completely re-organised in order to make it a public-friendly entity.
His predecessor too made a similar pledge upon taking over duties, but the police service has hardly made notable strides that has enhanced its reputation among the public. On the contrary, it continues to draw flak from all quarters due mainly to the actions of certain officers. The revelations made in the Lasantha and Thajudeen murders show the extent of complicity on the part of certain high ranking police officers which has brought a bad name on the police.
The recent incidents in Kandy also saw the public profile of the police hit the nadir. Its men were blamed for inaction and gross dereliction of duty in allowing the violence to escalate, resulting in massive damage to property. Certain incidents of police excesses like the one witnessed in Embilipitya some time ago also damaged the reputation of the police. Hence, the police service is badly in need of a shakeup and hopefully this time around the minister will ensure that a tangible change takes place that will restore the image of the countrys chief law enforcement establishment.
The Minister should start from brass tacks. The crime rate has certainly increased in recent times. Not a day passes without some murder being committed involving the underworld. Gangland wars involving tit for tat killings are on the upsurge endangering the lives of the ordinary people. This situation has to be reined in. No doubt the IGP had recently ordered countrywide operations to round up criminals, which is commendable. But, given the escalating crime rate, one wonders how successful this endeavour is.
Of course, the picture is not entirely bleak. There have been spectacular detections and successful crime busting operations on the part of the police that was given wide publicity in the media. There were also instances where police officers paid the supreme sacrifice in the line of duty, like the constable who functioned as a security officer to a High Court judge in Jaffna was killed when the assailants targeted the latter. Hence the risks run by the men in khaki, while affording protection to the public, too should be acknowledged and appreciated. It is also an accepted fact that the police officers are among the poorly paid public servants in the country and steps should be taken to rectify this situation, especially given the risks involved in the service. Attention should also be paid to the families of the police personnel, especially where the schooling of their children are concerned. It is known that during the war years children of the military personnel were given special preference where school admission of their children were concerned.It is not known if this was extended to the police too. If not, the minister should take steps to make some arrangements where the children of the police personnel are concerned, considering the nature of their duties and the risks involved.
It is nine years since the war was brought to a conclusion and the onus is on the minister to make the police service a strictly civilian law enforcement entity. Like in the case of the tri-forces, recruitment to the police during the period of the war was carried out dispensing with exacting standards due to the urgent need for augmenting manpower. In the process certain undesirable too gain entry to both, the services and the police. Perhaps, the excesses reported relating to certain members of the police, as with the forces, in most instances could be attributed to this factor. It is also an accepted fact that the war, while it brutalized society as whole, took a heavy toll on the forces and the police who were directly exposed to the fighting. Traces of this could be seen in certain actions of the police. Some of the bad eggs may still be in the service. Hence, the minister should take measures to weed out the criminal elements, which would help in a big way to take the police service go back to the pre-war years, where it was a public-friendly law enforcement entity. Efforts should also be made to make the members of the police service interact more with the general public. This could be achieved through sports events, sharmadanas etc. carried out jointly by the local police and members of the public.
It is time that the police was re-branded and given a new facelift, both in outlook and performance, harking back to the good old days when the khaki uniform was regarded with awe and respect. Regrettably though, this respect for the police uniform had waned during the past years due to the actions of the bad eggs, mentioned already. It will be the ministers task to restore the somewhat sullied image of the police service and make it a public-friendly entity, as is his stated objective.

New tax measures to yield RS.60 BN revenue
The Government expects to earn a revenue of Rs. 60 billion each year through the new Inland Revenue Act (IRA) which came into effect on Sunday (1), said Finance and Mass Media Ministry, Deputy Secretary, S.R. Attygalle yesterday.
This year, within the next two quarters he said he expected the government to rake in Rs 30 billion.
Finance Ministry officials together with Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and State Minister Eran Wickremaratne addressing a media briefing at the ministry strove to explain the misconceptions that have risen as a result of the new Act.
The Inland Revenue Act No 24 of 2017 passed on October of last year had sought to broaden the tax base, reduce the number of indirect taxes and simplify the overall tax structure, explained Minister Samaraweera.
In Malaysia, the percentage of tax revenue from direct taxes stands at 72 percent, in India the figure is at 54 percent, in South Korea at 45 percent, in Bangladesh 32 percent but in Sri Lanka the number stands at 18 percent.
The aim is to increase this to 40 percent by 2020, the Minister said.
At present, both the rich as well as poor pay the same amount of tax for their essential goods at a supermarket. A reduction in indirect taxes could change that.
The Joint Opposition (JO) however has stated that the new Act has actually increased the tax burden on the common man. The examples they cite mainly come from alleged taxes or increases in; migrant workers remittances, in the sale of land, in income tax and pensions.
The Minister thus explained that no tax would be levied on migrant workers remittances, income tax would only be liable to employees earning over Rs 100,000 a month and only pensioners who earn an interest of Rs 1.5 million a year or over would be subjected to a withholding tax of five percent on their interest.
Further, a capital gains tax is applicable on the gain derived from the sale of an extra land/house.
For example, if you had an extra land which was valued at Rs 900,000 on 30 September 2017 and you sell it this year for Rs 1 million, that difference of Rs 100,000 will have a 10 percent tax imposed, explained State Minister Wickremaratne.
The determination of the market value of such assets however would need a proper mechanism and the Minister said the Ministry would introduce one in future.
Responding to allegations from the Joint Opposition, Minister Samaraweera said they had also included suggestion and recommendations made by the JO in their bill and stated that the opposition now was all political.
The Bill we got when we took over this Ministry had issues and we changed certain problematic areas. We had wider consultations from all political parties and the business community to prepare this, said Minister Samaraweera. He believed that this was one of the most progressive in South Asia when it came to social justice.

NSYNC and Backstreet Boys stars clashed over a girl
NSYNC singer Chris Kirkpatrick once wanted to kill Backstreet Boys star A.J. McLean for dating his ex-girlfriend.
The Bye Bye Bye hitmaker reveals he was livid when he found out A.J. had been badmouthing him to a woman he had recently parted ways with, and Chris was ready to beat up McLean when he took up with issue with his pop rival face-to-face.
I wanted to punch A.J.s lights out for a little while. I was dating a girl, I broke up with her and he started dating her, Chris tells Billboard.com. And I guess he was talking smack to her about me, so I confronted him on it and wanted to kick his a**.
Luckily, the dispute didnt come to blows, although Kirkpatrick cant quite recall how the event actually unfolded.
I dont know how it got resolved - I saw him out one night and said I wanted to kill him, but I said, Lets get a beer..., he remembered. Now were really good friends.
Pop fans have long pitted the two boy bands against one another, but the singers never really considered the chart rivalry any more than friendly competition.
We cant control how people are gonna take it. All we can do is control how we give it, explained *NSYNCs JC Chasez. The doors are open - we just focus on making our shows good, making sure we sound good, and making sure the records were good.
It created a friendly competition, added bandmate Joey Fatone, before quipping, Theres nothing wrong with friendly competition - even though we are, of course, better than any of those boy bands. Maybe not right now, (were) a little rusty.

NZ expertise to develop SLs adventure tourism
Sri Lanka has sought expertise from New Zealand in developing the countrys adventure tourism segment and improving high end hospitality training.
The request for expertise was made by Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga during his keynote address at the inauguration of the fourth New Zealand Trade Mission Meeting which commenced in Colombo yesterday.
A group of 20 delegates representing 13 New Zealand companies arrived in Colombo on a 3-day visit aimed at forging business and trade links with Sri Lanka.
The delegation was led by New Zealand Trade Commissioner for Sri Lanka, Ralph Hays and included High Commissioner for New Zealand in India and Sri Lanka, Joanna Kempkers.
Tourist arrivals from New Zealand increased by nearly 15% last year and we would like to see this robust growth continue in the next few years, especially in the high-end adventure tourism category where New Zealand is a world leader.
I believe Sri Lanka has much to learn from New Zealand Tourism and would like to see greater collaboration and also assistance in high end hospitality training and know-how on developing our own tourism assets which are of a similar nature and well suited for adventure tourism, the Minister observed.
Tourism is New Zealands number one export earner with nearly 190,000 people directly employed by the industry. Im convinced that tourism offers an equitable pathway to ease the trade deficit which is currently very much in favour of New Zealand. Tourism receipts from New Zealand have the potential to ease this lop-sided trade balance. As the same time I request New Zealand companies to invest in Sri Lanka as the fundamentals are now in place for strong economic growth, the Minister said.
With Sri Lanka entering in to Free Trade Agreements with countries such as India and Singapore, New Zealand companies have the opportunity of using Sri Lanka as a manufacturing and trading base to access the vast regional market, Minister Amaratunga added stating that he looked forward to the opening of the New Zealand High Commission in Colombo next year.
Two-way trade between New Zealand and Sri Lanka has grown by 31% over the past three years and is now worth NZD367 million (41.3 billion LKR). The majority of trade is commodity based but there are increasing opportunities in a variety of sectors including tourism, aviation, agriculture, electronics and education.
Speaking during the event New Zealand Trade Commissioner for Sri Lanka, Ralph Hays said, We feel there are many areas of opportunity such as sustainable tourism development for New Zealand and Sri Lanka to collaborate and to share expertise, said Hays.
Endorsing the views of the Trade Commissioner, High Commissioner Joanna Kempkers stated that outbound tourist traffic from New Zealand was on the increase especially to the Indian sub-continent region and that Sri Lanka should look at attracting a greater volume of this traffic.

ONUR funds Rs 500 mn N-E irrigation project
The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) in partnership with the Department of Agrarian Development is planning to implement its annual minor irrigation improvement project in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
The commencement ceremony of the Rs. 500 million worth project, mainly aiming to renovate 120 minor irrigation tanks and canals, was held in Jaffna yesterday with the participation of former President and ONUR Chairperson Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga.
The main objective of this project is to increase the water storage capacity by solving the shortcomings of the existing irrigation system in the area. This will be an effective solution for proper water storage facilities to manage water supply. In effect, this facility would utilise water during both the drought and rainy season.
As the first phase of the project, 54 small tanks out of the projected 120 will be renovated in each district.
According to the preliminary estimate, upon the completion of the project, the existing agricultural area will be extended by 10,934 acres, while benefiting 5,573 farming families with a median added value of Rs 39,000 per family. This project will increase the paddy harvest by 335,757 bushels and enable 29,819 kg fish harvest by introducing a suitable fresh water fish species, while increasing the water availability by 8,872 ac.ft. This project is estimated to benefit the other field crops (OFC) land by increasing the potential by 1397 acres.
The management of fresh water as a community value is estimated to bring relief to all residents in the area. Upon completion of this project, the public engaging in agrarian activities, as well as those engaging in the aquaculture industry in the area will be benefitted.
This is yet another project funded by ONUR aiming to consolidate the natural resource available towards improving the livelihood of the inhabitants in the former conflict zone.

Pakistan thrash depleted West Indies in 1st T20
Karachi, Sunday: Pakistan thrashed a depleted West Indies side by 143 runs in the first Twenty20 on Sunday at the National Stadium in Karachi, the first international match in the city for nine years.
Pakistan, the world's top-ranked T20 side, equalled their highest total in the format of 203-5 in 20 overs before bowling the West Indies out for their lowest-ever T20 total -- 60 runs -- in 13.4 overs.
The West Indies, missing their regular skipper Carlos Brathwaite and stars like Chris Gayle and Kieron Pollard, could not handle Pakistan's varied bowling attack.
Only Marlon Samuels (18), Rayad Emrit (11) and Keemo Paul (10) reached double figures.
Pakistan's margin of victory is the second-biggest in T20s, behind Sri Lanka's 172-run win over Kenya in Johannesburg in 2007.
Previously, the hosts' biggest victory in T20s was a 102-run win against Bangladesh in Karachi in 2008, after scoring 203-5.
Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Nawaz and Shoaib Malik got two wickets each.
Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed praised his team's performance in the series-opener.
"I think we were excellent today," said Ahmed. "We have an important match tomorrow and with another win we can seal the series win."
The West Indies' new T20 skipper Jason Mohammad blamed the defeat on poor batting.
"It was a tough day. We did well with the ball till the last two overs. It was a good wicket, but our shot execution wasn't good," said Mohammad, who fell for nought.
The West Indies' previous lowest T20 total was 79-7 against Zimbabwe at Port of Spain in 2010.
Debutant Hussain Talat top-scored for Pakistan with a 37-ball 41, hitting a six and two boundaries. He added 75 for the third wicket with Sarfraz, who scored a 22-ball 38 with a six and four boundaries.
Opener Fakhar Zaman hit a 24-ball 39, while Shoaib Malik played a fiery knock of 37 not out, facing 14 deliveries and hitting two sixes and four boundaries.
The charge helped Pakistan get 66 runs in the last five overs.
Despite this being the first international match in Karachi -- Pakistan's largest city -- only 18,000 people watched the match in the 33,000-capacity stadium. But those present were in a celebratory mood.
"It's something we've been trying to prove, that it's safe to play here," said Zehra Kazmi, a housewife.
Aftab Khan, a student, said he was hoping for more top-level cricket on Pakistani soil.
"I can't express my feelings in words so we welcome all the players from the international cricket," he said.
"They should come to Pakistan and play... because Pakistan is a very peaceful country."
The three-match T20 series against the West Indies is seen as a big step towards reviving international cricket in Pakistan, which was suspended in 2009 following a 2009 militant attack on the Sri Lankan team bus in Lahore.
Pakistan hosted five limited over internationals against Zimbabwe in 2015 before last year's final of the Pakistan Super League, followed by a T20 series against a World XI and a T20 against Sri Lanka.
This year Pakistan staged two PSL play-offs in Lahore before last Sunday's final of the T20 tournament in Karachi.

Poverty in Colombo district is 0.9 percent and is 7.1 percent in Kegalle district. Poverty in the Ratnapura district is 6.8 percent, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
According to Minister Seneviratne, 1.1 million people live in the Ratnapura district and 110,925 of them are Samurdhi recipients. The population of Sabaragamuwa Province is about 1.8 million. Therefore it is appropriate to have a separate ministry to develop the province. He was speaking in Ratnapura recently.
Minister Seneviratne pointed out that only Rs. 500 million has been allocated for Sabaragamuwa Development Office and it is not adequate at all. Funds need to be sourced from other avenues to carry out development activities. A lot of development work needs to be done in order to upgrade the living standards of the people in the province.
Sabaragamuwa has natural beauty, but there are a lot of shortcomings in the province when it comes to infrastructure facilities. Roads to be developed. People do not have adequate drinking water. Drinking water will be supplied to the people in the province soon, he added.

More than 6,000 vacancies in different grades of the Department had not been filled, and the government does not pay attention to the Railway Department, he said.

Severe drought in Apura
Prevailing drought in the Anuradhapura district is rising in intensity. According to weather forecasts, the Anuradhapura district would not receive heavy rains until the end of May.
Farmers who had lost their cultivations during the past three consecutive cultivation seasons, are undergoing hardships. Referring to the issue, Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that it is necessary to confine paddy and additional crop cultivations to a limited landscape. Due to the drought, water levels of the tanks in the Anurdhapura district, are dwindling at the rate of 1.5 to 2 feet per month.
He said the Mahaweli water via the Kala Wewa is supplied only to the Hurulu Wewa, Nuwara Wewa, Tissa Wewa, Nachchaduwa and Thuruwila tanks, whereas other large and medium-scale tanks in the district are depending mainly on seasonal rainfall.
During the 2017 Yala Season, only 22,500 hectares of paddy lands were cultivated in the Anuradhapura district. In 2016, it had been only 26,700 hectares, while in 2015, the landscape area that came under paddy cultivation was 84,430 Wanninayake added.
Therefore, it had been planned to cultivate around 42,000 hectares of land with paddy, under the 13 major irrigation tanks and 60 minor tanks during the 2018 Yala Season, Wanninayaka said
However, after consulting the Irrigation Department, the cultivations to be carried out under the 83 medium-scale tanks could be decided soon. Steps would be taken to provide seed paddy and fertiliser subsidies to farmers, while top-priority would be given to the management of irrigation water, he added.
In the meantime, the government agent said further steps are taken to continue the provision of Rs. 5,000 worth dry food rations among drought-stricken farmer families within the district.
Apart from this, a number of around 20,000 people suffering from the lack of drinking water, would be provided with potable water with the use of water bowsers, in the Nochchiyagama, Mahawilachchiya and Rajangane Divisional Secretariat divisions.

South African anti-apartheid campaigner Winnie Mandela dies at 81

Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former wife of the late President Nelson Mandela, has died at age 81.
The family said in a statement that she passed away at the Netcare Milpark Hospital in Johannesburg, South Africa after a long illness, for which she had been in and out of hospital since the start of the year.
"Madikizela-Mandela was one of the greatest icons of the struggle against apartheid," the statement said.
"She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country." Her death came as a shock.
"None of us had predicted this," a family spokesman told CNN. Madikizela-Mandela was known as the "Mother of the Nation" because of her struggle against white-minority rule in South Africa.
She was married to Nelson Mandela for 38 years, including the 27 years he was imprisoned on an island near Cape Town. "She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the struggle for justice in South Africa one of its most recognizable faces," the statement said.
The couple were divorced in 1996, two years after Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first black President.
They had two daughters together. Nelson Mandela died in 2013. A longtime stalwart of the ruling African National Congress, or ANC, political party, Madikizela-Mandela was a member of South Africa's parliament at the time of her death.
One of the last official visits she received was from current South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who went with her to Soweto township last month to encourage people to register to vote in next year's presidential election. On Monday, Ramaphosa praised Madikizela-Mandela as "an advocate for the dispossessed and the marginalized" and "a voice for the voiceless."
"Even at the darkest moments of our struggle for liberation, Mam' Winnie was an abiding symbol of the desire of our people to be free," Ramaphosa said in a statement.
"In the midst of repression, she was a voice of defiance and resistance. In the face of exploitation, she was a champion of justice and equality."
A memorial service for Mandela will be held April 11 and an "official national" funeral will be April 14, Ramaphosa said.
A link to the outside world Born in 1936 in what is now known as the Eastern Cape province, Nomzamo Winifred Madikizela was the daughter of a history teacher.
As a young social worker, she married Nelson Mandela in 1958 at age 22, and stood by him in the years following his 1964 conviction and life imprisonment sentence for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government.
Madikizela-Mandela led an international campaign calling for his release. While Nelson Mandela was banned from reading newspapers, his wife was his link to the outside world.
Madikizela-Mandela told him of the changes taking place in his homeland and became his often outspoken and controversial public voice.
Nelson Mandela was finally freed in 1990.
His defiance of white-minority rule and his long incarceration for fighting against state-sanctioned segregation focused world attention on South Africa's apartheid system, making him the symbol of the struggle to end the practice and bring racial equality to his country.
Outside Africa, Madikizela-Mandela was known largely because of her ex-husband, but in South Africa she was the mouthpiece and face of the bitter struggle against the racist regime.
"She refused to be bowed by the imprisonment of her husband, the perpetual harassment of her family by security forces, detentions, bannings and banishment," said Archbishop Desmond Tutu in a statement.
"Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists."
