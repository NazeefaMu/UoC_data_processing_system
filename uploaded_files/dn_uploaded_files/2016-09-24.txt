Nalanda, Mahinda continue strong form in Murali Harmony Cup
Nalanda College continued with their impressive early-tournament form with another clinical display on day two of the Murali Harmony Cup 2016, defeating Kalutara Maha Vidyalaya to remain group leaders.
Batting first, Nalanda made 118 runs thanks to a sensible run-a-ball 51 by SD Wijewardana who anchored the innings for his team. Lakshan and Silva were impressive with the ball for KMV each bagging 3 wickets for 27 runs.
Set a target of 119, KMV were in all sorts of early trouble as Subasinghe struck for Nalanda with three quick top order wickets sending Jayawardena, Kavinda and Nayanajith back to the pavilion without scoring.
KMV never could recover from their bad start and were eventually bowled out for 66.
Mahinda (126 runs) had a close call against Kingswood College (121/7) as they won by 5 runs at Mullativu in what was easily the match of the day.
Batting first, Mahinda stumbled earlier on as they lost their first two wickets for 12 runs. However a collective batting effort which rallied around skipper Welihinder (39 runs with 4 x 4s and 2 x 6s) saw them through to a decent total.
A target of 122 was always going to be a challenge for Kingswood given the depth of Mahindas bowling.
However, Kingswood did well in the middle overs with Liyanage and skipper Chandrasiri scoring 29 and 27 respectively to bridge the gap.
Kaushalya (19) and Wijesiriwardena (11) batted well under pressure however, thanks to some brilliant fielding by the Mahinda wicket-keeper Dulsara who affected two brilliant run outs.
The last six balls of the game went without a single run being conceded and Mahinda walked back victorious and unbeaten.
Scores:
St. Joseph's College 186/5 (20/20 ov), Moneragala Combined 108 (18.2/20 ov)
Royal College 111 (20/20 ov), Seenigama Combined Schools 112/6 (18.0/20 ov)

Aussie BMX star partially paralysed after accident
SYDNEY, FRIDAY: Australian former BMX world champion and two-time Olympian Sam Willoughby has been left partially paralysed after a training accident in the United States, with no movement from the chest down.
The 25-year-old, who won silver at the 2012 London Olympics but could only manage sixth in Rio this year, underwent surgery for fractures to his vertebrae which compressed his spinal cord after a crash near San Diego on September 10, his family said.
Fortunately, this surgery was successful enough at decompressing his spinal cord and aligning his vertebrae that a second operation for further stabilisation was not necessary, they said in a statement issued through Cycling Australia late Thursday.
At this stage, Sam still has no movement from his chest down but has regained use of his arms and is slowly regaining some sensation in his legs.
Sams next step is to begin a long road of recovery at a rehabilitation centre and while the details are still to be finalised, at this stage it is expected that Sam will be transported to a USA-based rehabilitation centre in the next few days.
Willoughby started competing aged six in Adelaide, and burst onto the scene by claiming the junior world championship in 2008. AFP

Yasir Jan - The ambidextrous pacer from Pakistan
The former Australia coach John Buchanan once foresaw the future of cricket. It will be ambidextrous, he had said in 2009. Seven years on, names like Kamindu Mendis, the Sri Lankan under-19 World Cupper and Indias 23-year-old from Vidharbha, Akshay Karnewar are proving him right.
But both were spinners. What Pakistan unveiled to the world this week is a breed of its own kind  a fast bowler who can bowl at speeds in excess of 135 kmph with either hand! Fast bowlers are known to hunt in pairs, but Yasir Jan, a teenager from Charsadda in north-western Pakistan, can do both on his own. A discovery in a talent hunt organised by Pakistan Super League team Lahore Qalandars, Jan left everyone, including former fast bowler Aaqib Javed, spellbound when he steamed in and hurled the ball at an astonishing speed.
A closer look revealed he could have the same impact when bowling with his right, and with his left. Videos of him doing a Steyn with his right, and Mohammad Amir with his left are going viral. According to reports in the Pakistan media, the Islamabad residents has an action as clean as Wasim Akram with the left arm and Imran Khan with right.
Its not a natural talent for the Pakistani but one he worked on since childhood. A right-hander by birth, Jan can generate more swing and
disconcerting bounce bowling left arm, if not the speed to match when delivering with his natural arm. According to the laws of the game, a bowler can change the hand with which he is bowling, after he has informed the umpire and the batsmen.  TNN
