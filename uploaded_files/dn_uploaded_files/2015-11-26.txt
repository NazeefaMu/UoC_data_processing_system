Rumours of tariff increases baseless
No-confidence motion poses no challenge
Rumours of an impending increase in water, electricity and telephone bills due to 2016 budget proposals are without any basis, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The minister assured that the government would never heap unnecessary burden on the people.
Minster Karunanayake stated this at a foundation laying ceremony yesterday at Bodhi Samudrarama Vihara, Mutwal.
Responding to queries of journalists, the minister said that the no-confidence to be moved against him allegedly by some opposition MPs would not pose any threat to him.
The minister said, Through this budget we restored many privileges that have been denied to the people during the past 11 years. It is said that this no-confidence motion is to be moved by a group who lined their pockets with public funds. Since they are no longer able to abuse public funds, they have resorted to these methods.
I dont consider this as a challenge in any way, Karunanayake said.
Some say that the budget has given nothing to the people. Still some others claim a no-confidence motion would be moved. However, from the very next day of the budget, the people have felt the relief given through the budget.
Investments have been increased. Small and medium scale enterprises have been rejuvenated, the minister said. The minister also donated Rs. 50,000 to the chief incumbent of the temple, Ven. Thumbe Upananda thera for the ongoing development activities of the Temple.
Meanwhile, the Minister also visited the Sri Bodhirajaramaya Temple, Thotalanga yesterday and donated Rs. 50,000 to the chief incumbent, Ven. Nivitigala Gnaninda thera for the proposed new building of the temple.
Colombo Municipal Councilors Tharanga Athuraliya, Roy Bogahawatta, Aluthgedara Chaminda and Sunil Vithanage and a large number of residents were present.

Be poetic, please!

In the late 60s, a group of us were invited to participate in the BBC's 'Poetry Please' session organised by the World Service. It broadcast poetry to 44 countries. As an onlooker, I was inspired as to how poems could be delivered to our local listeners.
Three poets were invited to read out poetry. The first poet was a broadcaster himself in his 50s. He came all the way from California to spend a month in the UK. I still have the collection of poems by this poet, Robert Bly, who introduced himself, if I remember right, as a prose poet. His compilation is titled as 'The Morning Glory' running to 35 printed pages with illustrations (a publication of Kayak Books in San Francisco 1969).
We listened silently to his first prose poem.
Looking at a dead wren in my hand
Forgive the hours spent listening to radios,
And the words of gratitude I did not say to teachers.
I love your tiny rice- like legs, like bars of music played in an empty church,
And the feminine tail,
Where no worms of Empire have ever slept,
And the intense yellow chest that makes tears come.
Your tail feathers open like a picket fence,
And your bill is brown,
With the sorrow of an old Jew whose daughter has married an athlete
The black spot on your head is your own mourning cap.
A serious discussion followed.
Bly simply said: "I am an imagist. I think in terms of images."
This was followed by Ronald Duncan, a scientist turned poet. He was inspired by T S Eliot who had also been one of his mentors. His collection was titled as 'Man'. He wanted to bring out three more parts of 'Man' in time to come. Ronald also wanted to write his autobiography, but it had so happened that in his isolation he had played with words. In the end it had given way to another form of a biography.
"I was in no state to tackle any serious creative work. In 1961 I suffered an emotional crisis. I found myself having to live alone in a modern luxury flat in London. To prevent myself dwelling in my predicament, I wanted to write my autobiography.
But what happened was amazing. I jotted down some lines which read more like poetry rather than a biography."
Then Duncan went on reading some lines.
I am God: I could become
If I could remember my future
As I have forgotten my past
I am God: I will become
When I can imagine the whole
As I have remembered a part.
I am the god I shall become
For I am the only conscious thing
In an unconscious universe
I am the dreamer who can dream
He is dreaming
I am the miracle: man
A year of years lies behind my name
A century of centuries has waited for this hand
It took all time's tide to reach me
The expanding darkness has groped for me;
Through the leafless wood the blind winds blown to me;
Beneath the heavy ocean,
The patient coral reached for me;
I am the miracle; the man
look into my eyes for there all history is recorded
And even the granite's tale is told.
What a fascinating little poem... we all acclaimed Duncan. And Duncan responded: "Thank you for your miraculous listening. Let me tell you frankly that it is an unfinished piece though it looks complete."
The third poet was a fellow broadcaster from Yorkshire, Christopher Pilling. He distributed a flimsy collection of poems titled as 'Snakes and Girls'. He was the first winner of the New Poet's Award in 1969. He was the runner up in the Camden Festival of Poetry Competition.
I recall what he said: 'This is just not a romantic poem. But I am undoubtedly inspired in my childhood from many romantic poems. I thank them for making me alive.'
Then he read his sonnet-like poem in a singsong manner.
Wild Flower
Only the thistle did not droop
It did not prick my hand
Round its stem of hairs
It asserts its realm
In earthenware
I am the mauve one
Handsome spiky
Because you held me
I stand for the hillside.
He made a melodious hum after two lines.
The radio broadcasting of poems was to be a tough task back then. The radio producers had to imagine how a poem could be aired. Anyhow, this was a pioneer attempt. It made things easier for the young poets to read their written poems to an audience leading, which finally led to a poetic discourse.

Ben Carson considers return to Australia to lift foreign policy game
US: Ben Carson, the retired paediatric neurosurgeon who with Donald Trump has dominated Republican primary polls, is considering visiting Australia as part of an international trip to bolster his foreign policy credentials, according to reports.
Dr Carson, a favourite among Christian evangelical voters, has slumped in recent polls after revealing apparent gaps in his knowledge of foreign policy. The trend against him has increased since the Paris attacks, with conservative and evangelical voters turning to Mr Trump and Senator Ted Cruz.
A Carson campaign official reportedly told CBS that Dr Carson was considering a trip to either Australia  where he worked as a surgeon for a year in 1983  Africa or Asia, to change the focus of his campaign before the crucial Iowa caucuses, the first competition of the primaries, in February.
Dr Carson attracted criticism on foreign policy after a series of blunders. During one interview he said incorrectly that China was engaged in fighting in Syria, and in another he said he would combat Islamic State by forging a coalition of American regional allies, but could not name any. Another blow came when an adviser to Dr Carson told The New York Times that he was struggling to grasp foreign policy despite attempts to tutor him.
Nobody has been able to sit down with him and have him get one iota of intelligent information about the Middle East, the adviser on terrorism and national security, Duane Clarridge, told the Times. He added that Dr Carson needed weekly conference calls briefing him on foreign policy so we can make him smart.
Early this month Dr Carson topped the Republican primary favourite, Mr Trump, for several days, according to the Real Clear Politics average of national polls, polling at 24.8 per cent to Mr Trump's 24.6 per cent of likely Republican voters.
But since the gaffes and the attacks on Paris Republican primary voters have apparently returned to Mr Trump, whose confident and brash language is the tonal opposite of Dr Carson, who is softly spoken and  by comparison  measured.
On Sunday, Mr Trump was leading by 27.5 per cent to 19.8 per cent.
Dr Carson, who grew up in the tough suburbs of Detroit only to forge a career as one of the United States most celebrated surgeons, worked for a year as a neurosurgeon in Australia in 1983. In June Dr Carson discussed the experience with the arch-conservative audience at a Faith & Freedom Coalition conference.
The biggest problem we had was keeping up with all the dinner invitations, he said. They love Americans and they like to hear your accent, Dr Carson said. When I would dictate an operative, sometimes the ladies would call me and say Dactah Car-son! We can't understand your accent.' He said he would respond, Excuse me, I'm the American. You have the accent.
Dr Carson, who says his life has been shaped at crucial points by the direct intervention of God, said he realised why God had sent him to Australia. There were only four neurosurgical consultants in all of western Australia.
And once they discovered that I knew how to operate ... they left me in charge of the major teaching hospital, said Dr Carson, who would have been 32 at the time.

China dreams of electric sheep at robot conference
CHINA: In a martial artists white silk pyjamas, a man practised tai-chi in harmony with a motorised arm at a Beijing exhibition showcasing a vision of robots with Chinese characteristics.
Vehicles with automated gun turrets sat alongside drink-serving karaoke machines at the World Robot Conference, as manufacturers sought new buyers for their jiqiren -- machine people in Chinese.
The push has support at the highest levels of government. President Xi Jinping issued a letter of congratulations for the conference, and the industry is name-checked in the draft version of the countrys new five-year plan, the policy document that guides national economic development.
The worlds second-largest economy is already the leading market for industrial robots, accounting for a quarter of global sales, according to the International Federation of Robotics.
But executives at a conference roundtable said the real market opportunity was in service robots for the homes and offices of the worlds most populous country.
There are now less than 100,000 robots in Chinese families, not including vacuum cleaners, said Liu Xuenan, chief executive officer of Canbot. In the future, said Yu Kai, the head of Horizon Robotics, Chinas automated helpers will do everything from building cars to driving them, predicting that each person might have 10 robots -- nearly 14 billion potential tin men at current population levels.
Robots have captured Chinas imagination. From Transformers to Baymax, the star of Disneys movie Big Hero 6, Chinese consumers have embraced robot heroes, spending hundreds of millions on related movies and merchandise.
In Chinese cities, businesses try to attract customers with robot waiters, cooks, and concierges. In the countryside, rural Da Vincis cobble together mechanical men from scrapyard junk.
A panel at the conference struggled with the question of how China would deal with the rise of artificially intelligent machines.
But the transition from the world of fantasy and novelty to a real robot economy could be tricky, with the countrys technology still lagging far behind neighbours Korea and Japan, the undisputed king of the robots.

Climate, extremism top agenda at Commonwealth summit talks
UK: Tackling climate change and countering violent extremism will top the agenda at the Commonwealth summit in Malta this week, attended by Queen Elizabeth II and French President Francois Hollande.
Coming after the Paris terror attacks this month and just before the COP21 world climate talks hosted in the French capital, the meeting will bring together G20 powers and tiny microstates spanning the continents.
Because the 53-country group contains such diverse countries, the talks are being closely watched in world capitals for signs of agreement on climate change that could herald a deal at the UN COP21 summit.
It can really help the outcome in Paris, Liz Gallagher, programme leader at the E3G environmental think-tank, told AFP -- even though major powers such as China and the United States are not involved.
The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) begins on Friday and wraps up on Sunday, a day before the COP21 talks start in Paris.
Born out of the British empire, the Commonwealth of Nations brings together around a quarter of the worlds countries and a third of its population.
Gallagher said she would be looking out for the organisations main developed economies -- Australia, Britain and Canada -- outlining the contours of a support package for the most vulnerable countries.
This is one of the big sticking points, she said.
New voices in the negotiations, such as Malaysia and Singapore, as well the views of new leaders in Australia and Canada, will also be of particular interest.
The climate talks will be attended by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Hollande, who is keen to emphasise the urgency of climate talks -- particularly on newly-elected Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, officials said.
Queen Elizabeth, the Head of the Commonwealth, will pay a state visit to Malta from Thursday for the summit, accompanied by her husband Prince Philip, their eldest son Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.
CHOGM is taking place during a critical year when the world determines the path forward on significant global issues, said Commonwealth Secretary-General Kamalesh Sharma.
An indication of its significance is that among the few ideas adopted at the flop 2009 Copenhagen climate talks were those emanating from the preceding CHOGM.
The Commonwealth is now proposing debt for climate action swaps, whereby smaller island states and developing countries could get debt relief in return for action on climate change.
We think thats an innovative idea that we would like to get ratified and take us through to COP21, summit spokesman Neil Ford told AFP.
In an interview with Britains Sky News television, Prince Charles said rising global temperatures needed to be dealt with urgently by international forums.
Do we really have to face catastrophes and chaos before we understand that real action needs to be taken, said the 67-year-old, who will also be giving a keynote speech at the Paris talks.
Among the other topics on the table in Malta are international migration, trade between Commonwealth nations and the all too relevant issue of extremism.
Ford said sessions on combating radicalisation take on added significance following the jihadist attacks in Paris on November 13 in which 130 people died.
We are planning a programme on countering violent extremism. It will look at what can be done to empower young people but also how you police cyber-space and work on criminal justice systems to address this kind of situation.
Some 21 of the Commonwealths 53 member states have new leaders since the last summit in 2013, held in Colombo.
More than 30 premiers are expected to attend.
What makes the Commonwealth special is shared heritage, Ford said.
Its members share a common language, and similar administrative, legal and parliamentary systems. So its very easy for them to share lessons learned, understand each other and act like a family.
Malta holds special memories of a more carefree time for Queen Elizabeth II, 89, and Prince Philip, 94.
They lived on the Mediterranean island as a newlywed couple between 1949 and 1951, when he was stationed in Malta as a naval officer and she was still a princess.

Expecting a Baby Boy!
Michael Phelps and Nicole Johnson recently announced that they're expecting their first child!
"We found out 8 weeks ago we were expecting," Phelps captioned the above photo on Instagram. "Today we're over 12 weeks and it looks like we're having a boy!! #babymp #mp#lifeabouttochange #mpswim"
Obviously, Michael isn't playing coy like so many other expecting celebs. There's a lot of information in those two sentences:
Nicole is three months along; she's expecting a boy; and judging by the "mp" hashtags, we're guessing his name will be Michael. Phelps and Johnson got engaged back in February, but have yet to announce when they plan to wed.
At first, the engagement was dismissed as a PR stunt by many, as it came on the heels of Phelps' DUI scandal, which resulted in several sordid details about his private life being made public.

Go green, but not with envy!
Wijewardena spends his spare time reading biographies and histories from the civil rights movements in America as well as books on World War II. He also listens to western music but this depends on the mood. It could be classical one day, opera or rock the next day, he said.
Ishara Jayawardane
Following the destruction caused by the 2004 Tsunami, Ruwan Wijewardene helped victims in his small way. With his friends, he collected whatever relief items he could find and went to Seenigama to distribute them. He made a big difference in a small way. 'Young Voices from Diyawanna' today features State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene. A stalwart politician, Wijewardene revealed insights into his personal and public life.
Early life
Wijewardene comes from a powerful family. He is the son of Ranjith Wijewardene, the Chairman of Wijeya Newspapers. His great grandfather D. S. Senanayake was the first Prime Minister of Ceylon and his grandfather Dudley Senanayake was the second Prime Minister of Ceylon. His paternal grandfather D. R. Wijewardena established Lake House.
Wijewardene has an elder brother and an elder sister. From an early age, he was interested in politics. He sat for his O/Level examination from S. Thomas' Prep School and studied for London A/Levels at Stafford International School. He later left for England to study Third World Politics at the University of Sussex. He also studied International Journalism at the City University of London.
He still has close contact with friends from school and university. He says a few of his close friends have been with him since pre-school times.
Key to success
"My key to success is being honest and saying what I have to say upfront. People are fed up with politicians who are dishonest and engage in corrupt activities. People appreciate honesty. Even when I was in the Opposition, I did my best to help people in my area. That gave me the encouragement to move forward. The people supported me throughout."
Challenges in life
The minister said one of the biggest problems he faces in life is lack of privacy.
"I guess in politics you don't have much of a private life. Everything is out in the open. Sometimes there are rumours. I believe in the freedom of expression. However, as politicians, we see unsavory stories being cooked up in the media that are totally untrue. This is just malicious mudslinging."
These are the challenges most politicians face. It is all a part of the game. Wijewardena knows that politicians just have to bear it and move on.
Message to youth
As a young parliamentarian and minister, he has a message to youths. "More than anything, put your country first. You must also excel in whatever you do. Remember to serve the country," he said.
Wijewardena was outspoken against those leaving the country and serving abroad.
"Unfortunately, we see a lot of youths trying to leave this country. This is because they feel they will prosper economically if they go abroad," he said. He added that it is important to convince expatriates to return and invest. "Whatever career you choose, do it right and be a good citizen. Whatever you do, put the country first," the Minister said.
Voice in Parliament
Wijewardena is keen on supporting ex -servicemen who have fought for the country.
"I am trying to do whatever I can through my ministry to support servicemen. I am here to do whatever I can for the country and the people. I want to see this country progress to its full potential. I think this country has lot of potential that is not being used. We have two great leaders now. If we go in the right direction, we will see a huge development."
Favourite historical figure
Abraham Lincoln is a person he admires. Wijewardena said: "He was a person who went through a lot of personal problems. He failed many times but never gave up. Even as a President, he chose people who were initially against him to his Cabinet. He got them closer and eventually they saw the great leader in him," he said.
"I think he is a hero. The way he managed the country during dark times with the civil war in the US is commendable."
Country's future
Sri Lanka has huge potential to be Asia's shining star. We have the right resources and our educational level is high.
Wijewardena added that the government is pushing for Sri Lanka to come to the standard of other countries with regard to technology. "We can surpass some of our neighbours as our policies are being re-thought. If we can get our economic strategies and technology sorted out, our country will be a leader in the region," he said.
New strategies and establishment of the rule of law would make the people feel safe. Women will have their place in society. Wijewardena believes that a country where a woman would feel safe to walk down the road in the middle of the night, would be created under this government. "I see a future where our children will receive the best education that we can give."
Books, movies and music
Wijewardena spends his spare time reading biographies and histories from the civil rights movements in America as well as books on World War II. He also listens to western music but this depends on the mood. It could be classical one day, opera or rock the next day, he said.
Hope for the world
"We live in the 21st century. World leaders should consider the possibilities of running out of food and water. They should work to establish world peace," the Minister said. "If you look at what is happening around the world, we seem to be going backwards. Terrorism is a huge problem, he said, referring to the Paris attacks and Syrian crisis.
"There are many things that should not be happening. I hope in the next few years, these conflicts will be resolved and a more prosperous era will dawn."
Female leadership
Wijewardena pointed out that Sri Lanka is no stranger to female leadership. "We were the first country in the world to have a female prime minister. Then we had Chandrika Bandaranaike as President. I think the USA is ready for a female president. Nobody thought they would be ready for a black president but Barack Obama became President."
Going back in time
"If I could go back in time, the one thing I would change is Black July. This spiraled the ethnic conflict to another level. The bombing of Hiroshima Nagasaki is also something that I would change."
A better world
Wijewardena is also an environmentalist. "We are not protecting our environment. We are slowly killing ourselves. Humanity is under threat because of global warming. I believe change is needed with regard to the human impact on the environment."
Leisure activities
"I love taking photographs. I like listening to music and maybe I would catch a movie or two. I also like reading and traveling. I am also a big rugby lover. I played rugby at school. I like football as well. You could call me a sports-lover."
Views on religion
Wijewardena is a Buddhist. He comes from a religious family, closely associated with the Buddhist temple. However, he believes that every religion teaches a person to be a good person.
"Religion has been used throughout history to obtain power. Religion has been distorted. Buddhism teaches how a person should behave - how to look after yourself and be a good human being. All religions teach this but people have interpreted religion to their convenience," he pointed out.
Life event that moved you
One event that moved me is the Central Bank bombing. It really shocked me. The other event was the Tsunami. My friends and I collected a lot of dry rations, clothes and water, and went down South. The destruction, bodies and the smell of death was harrowing. The smell did not leave me for weeks, Wijewardena said.
Admirable characteristics
Being open about oneself and being sensitive towards other people's feelings are traits that Wijewardena admires.
"Also some people let jealousy rule their emotions which is not healthy. If there is something that should be changed, it should be jealousy. This is the root cause of many social evils," he said.

Government aims to develop rural areas
The aim of the new government is to develop rural areas, Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluvihare said.
He was speaking at the inauguration of a village development programme 'Sodurugamak-Navaugayak'.
The infrastructure of all villages in the district will be developed, with the necessary financial allocations to be provided in time, he said.
The minister said that development would result in the rural economy being both protected and promoted.
He drew attention to certain villages in Matale engaged in traditional methods of livelihood, and said the government would support them in preserving their tradition.
"Farmers are the backbone of the country," he said, "pioneers of the national food programme, and for that reason every possible development of agricultural production will occur". He also said the government planned to promote education in rural areas and would facilitate that soon.
"The government has launched a vast development program in the country", he said, drawing attention to the fact that it was the first time in history that the United National Party had collaborated with the Sri Lanka Freedom Party to form a national government.
"It is a significant event," he said.

Govt will transform Southern mega projects into productive ventures - Prime Minister
Presiding over a forum of ministers and parliamentarians in the Southern province, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, while discussing new strategies for the South, said the government would make productive the mega development projects launched in Hambantota, despite dissimilar views within the government.
"Whatever different point of views on the mega projects launched in the South by the previous government, the reality is that the country has already spent colossal amount of money over these projects. As they have proved unproductive, these are hard financial burdens to bear. For this reason it is important to rectify the situation by transforming these mega projects into dynamic ventures, despite differences in opinion," the Prime Minister said.
"We who are united under the leadership of President Maitripala Sirisena, are making collective effort to usher progress and prosperity into the country.
We need the united cooperation of all the people's representatives towards this national goal," he said. He further elaborated that foreign investors had been invited, and that the government was in contact with China, in a bid to make dynamic these projects.
The Western Province's contribution towards the Gross National Product is 42% while Southern Province has contributed 10% towards it. The combined contribution of these two provinces' to the GDP is 52%, however, take note, these two provinces are the economic hubs of the country - the Prime Minister is reported to have said, urging those present not limit the decisions made that day mere rhetoric, but to, instead, duly implement the conclusions agreed upon at the forum.
He also said that a new committee of ministers, including Malik Samarawickrama, Arjuna Rantunga , Nimal Siripala De Silva and some others have been set up to look into the matters concerning the Hambantota Sea Port, and advised that all matters relating to the sea port be put forward to them.
The Prime Minister also revealed plans to develop the Mattala airport as an export centre for agro and fisheries from the Southern province, and from remote areas such as Monaragala , Hiniduma and Morawaka.
The forum was also attended by ministers Mangala Samaraweera, Gayantha Karunathilake, Chandima Weerakkodi, Vajira Abeywardana, Sagala Rathnayake and Laksman Yapa Abeywardane as well as Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva, Deputy ministers Dilip Wedaarachchi, Nishantha Mutuhettigama and number of high public officials

'Green' home tips

With the constantly changing environment around us, it is important to be environmentally aware and active. It's even more important when you consider how much money you can save by building a green home. The methods and ways you can go about changing your home from an emission-producing powerhouse into more of a greenhouse are easy and simple concepts. Everything you can think of in order to save energy can be implemented in creating a green space for you and your family.
By creating and managing a green home for you and your family to live in, not only will you be engaging in a positive atmosphere - but also you'll be passing on the lessons and importance of surrounding environmental issues to the rest of your family. While in the long run, going green will save you lots of money, the initial renovations needed to go green can sometimes be costly. Consider obtaining a home equity line of credit to finance your green home endeavours.
A green home
Green home building ideas
Location:
While buying property for yourself, take a note of a couple of things that you must foresee before moving in. Firstly, avoid building west facing home. This will keep your home cool as it minimizes sun exposure. Secondly, avoid building a home in environmentally sensitive locations such as earthquake or hurricane or flood prone areas. Thirdly, check if public transportation is easily available and the local grocery shop is not that far away. This will help you avoid taking your own vehicle every time and will reduce your travel time.
Smaller is better:
A small home built with eco-friendly techniques is going to have smaller environmental impact as against a large home. Try to keep the place manageable and cost effective. If you are planning to extend your family and bring in few relatives, you need to put proper resources and accommodation in place.
Energy efficient equipment:
Use energy efficient appliances for homes. They offer significant cost and energy savings without compromising performance.
Proper insulation:
Insulation is one of the most important things that you need to consider while building a green home. Cooling accounts for 50% of your home's energy consumption. Don't let cooling of your interior spaces air go waste through improper insulation. Proper insulation will not only reduce your energy consumption but will bring down your electricity bills substantially.
Reduce, reuse and recycle:
Reduce your need for buying new products that are not environment friendly. Reuse your old material such as wood floors, doors, windows in your next home. Recycled materials such as recycled glass, aluminium, recycled tile, reclaimed lumber, recycled plastic can be used in green home building.
Use sustainable building materials:
If building a green home is your goal, then using environmentally or eco-friendly products should be on your list which can reduce the impact of construction on the environment. Each and every part of your house such as roofing material, building material, cabinets, counters and insulation to your flooring should be environmentally friendly. Use products such as reclaimed lumber, recycled plastic, recycled glass or natural products such as bamboo, cork and linoleum which are made of natural, renewable materials.
Install solar panels:
Solar energy is clean and renewable source of energy. Solar panels are an emerging and hot technology for people who want to utilize the natural power all around us, the sun. Solar panels may be expensive at first, but the long-term savings you can put into your pocket is a stunning example of the benefits of turning your life from black to green. The location of your house and the way you have constructed solar panels can determine how much power you can collect.
Rainwater harvesting systems and tank-less water heaters:
Install a rainwater harvesting system while building your green home to collect rainwater from roofs and then storing it in a tank. The collected water can then be used for other purposes such as toilets and sprinkler systems. Rain barrels are one of the most common methods of rainwater harvesting being used today.
With tank-less water heaters, you need not wait for the water to get heated. Tank-less water heaters heat only that much water that is needed as it is passed through electric coil. This gives you twin benefits. Firstly, it eliminates excess energy costs as it heats up only that much amount of water that is needed and secondly, you can get ample storage place by eliminating the hot water tank.
Eco-friendly lighting:
Both LED and CFL cost more upfront but use less energy and last longer than traditional incandescent bulbs. Since they offer significant cost savings in the long run, they can be ideal for your new green home.
Water conserving fixtures:
Low flow faucets, toilets, shower heads are few of the ways that you can use while building a green home to conserve water. They can cut down on your water bills cost and make your home much more environment friendly. Apart from that, consider buying washing machines and dishwashers that give you same kind of cleaning and can save water and energy.
How to become greener in your household
Some people think that going green can be a costly or difficult venture. However, there are so many different methods that people choose to go with that can help you save both the money and the effort that goes into making an extensive green energy plan for your home. Some of these methods are often forgotten by people who make green energy plans because they are just so simple and overlooked. These methods are:
Turning off any lights or appliances when you don't use them.
Remembering that even when you're not using something and it's plugged in, it's still eating away at potentially saved energy (this includes things like laptops, cellphone chargers, essentially everything you can think of that is plugged in).
Buying only recyclable containers and reusing plastics for food storage.
Creating a family energy plan that everyone can plan their daily routine by.
Having safe and environmentally friendly alternatives for things like entertainment. Eliminating the extensive use of the television or the Internet is also a great way to get the family more involved with one another. Plan family game nights and other fun ways to spend your time together.

Hollande, Obama vow to ramp up Islamic State fight
US: President Francois Hollande arrived at the White House on Tuesday seeking support for his newly declared war on the Islamic State group, as the US warned its citizens worldwide of heightened terror risks following the Paris attacks.
The French leader headed into hour-long talks with President Barack Obama on the campaign against IS in Syria and Iraq, as relations between Russia and Turkey -- both key to resolving the Syria conflict -- were plunged into crisis by Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane.
In Europe, the manhunt continued for Belgian-born Salah Abdeslam, a key suspect in the November 13 attacks that killed 130 people, while Brussels entered a fourth day of lockdown over fears of an imminent terror strike.
Police in France said they were analyzing what is thought to be a suicide belt similar to those used in the Paris attacks, found without its detonator in a dustbin in the Montrouge suburb of the capital. Telephone data placed Abdeslam in the area the night of the attacks.
France's security crackdown since the attacks has seen police search more than 1,200 premises, arrested 165 people and seized 230 weapons -- including weapons of war -- Interior Minister Bernard Cazenueve said Tuesday.
Authorities in neighbouring Belgium said they have charged a fourth person in connection with the bloodshed in Paris, which was claimed by the Islamic State group.
Brussels will stay on its highest level of alert at least until next Monday, with city-wide patrols of armed soldiers and police to ward off a threat the government said remains serious and imminent, though schools and the Metro train system will re-open Wednesday. Hollande's trip to Washington is part of a frantic week of shuttle diplomacy by the French leader as he tries to rally global support for increased strikes against IS.
He will hold talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Paris on Wednesday and with Putin in Moscow on Thursday, before dining with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the French capital on Sunday.
The UN Security Council last week authorized all necessary measures to fight IS.
But the delicate diplomacy around the conflict ran into further trouble after Russia confirmed one of its fighter jets had been shot down by Turkey at the Syrian border.
The US military backed up Turkey's claim that Turkish pilots had warned the Russian jet 10 times -- but failed to get a response -- before shooting it down.
But Russian President Vladimir Putin accused Ankara of a stab in the back.
Today's tragic event will have serious consequences for Russian-Turkish relations, he said.
Washington and Paris have stepped up their fight against IS in Syria, with France launching its first strikes from the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean on Monday and the US calling for more international cooperation against the jihadist group.
After a string of terror attacks in several countries, the US government issued a worldwide travel alert warning American citizens of increased terrorist threats.
Current information suggests that ISIL (another acronym for Islamic State), Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram and other terrorist groups continue to plan terrorist attacks in multiple regions, said a State Department travel advisory.
In Brussels, an eerie atmosphere hung over the city with soldiers in camouflage patrolling everywhere from railway stations to EU institutions.
France has said it will install security gates at stations in Paris and Lille for Thalys cross-Europe rail services by December 20.
A Thalys train from Amsterdam to Paris was attacked by a heavily armed man in August, but he was overpowered by passengers.
In Brussels normally bustling historic Grand Place, a few bars and restaurants were open for business but they were struggling to find customers.
The only real activity downtown was deliverymen offloading crates for near-empty shops as builders hammered together stalls for a Christmas market meant to open on Friday.
My grandson said we should up sticks and move to the south of the Yser river, just like in World War I (after the Germans invaded), said Michel, a retired man from a Dutch-speaking suburb.
The European Union and NATO, which both have their headquarters in Brussels, said they would boost security and urged non-essential staff to work from home.
Meanwhile, the federal prosecutor's office announced that a man arrested in a police operation in Belgium late Sunday has been charged with involvement in the Paris attacks, the fourth so far.

Hunger never waits for a tomorrow
The international community has embraced a new goal, the eradication of hunger by 2030. A majority of the countries FAO monitors72 of 129have achieved the Millennium Development Goal target of halving the prevalence of undernourishment between 1991 and 2014. More than 600 million people are still likely to be hungry in 2030. Some 800 million people continue to suffer hunger, and almost a billion live in extreme poverty.
Feeding the world
By 2050 well need to feed two billion more people without overwhelming the planet Agriculture is among the greatest contributors to global warming, emitting more greenhouse gases than all our cars, trucks, trains, and airplanes combinedlargely from methane released by cattle and rice farms, nitrous oxide from fertilized fields, and carbon dioxide from the cutting of rain forests to grow crops or raise livestock, accelerates the loss of biodiversity. As weve cleared areas of grassland and forest for farms, weve lost crucial habitat, making agriculture a major driver of wildlife extinction, pitting conventional agriculture and global commerce against local food systems and organic farms.
A single mother makes porridge for ten children in a Nairobi slum.
How can the world double the availability of food while simultaneously cutting the environmental harm caused by agriculture Jonathan Foley in the National Geographic has provided ideas.
Step one: Freeze agricultures footprint
Agricultures footprint has caused the loss of whole ecosystems around the globe, including the prairies of North America and the Atlantic forest of Brazil, and tropical forests continue to be cleared at alarming rates with most of the land cleared used to produce cattle, soybeans for livestock, timber, and palm oil.
Step two: Grow more on existing farms
Nearly all new food production in the next 25 years will have to come from existing agricultural land. Only 55 percent of food-crop calories directly nourish people. Meat, dairy, and eggs from animals raised on feed supply another 4 percent. Improving nutrient and water supplies where yields are lowest could result in a 58 percent increase in global food production.
Step three: Use resources more efficiently
Natures own water filters, giant Japanese scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off Canadas Vancouver Island. The farm also uses sea cucumbers and kelp to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish.
Finding innovative ways to better target the application of fertilizers and pesticides by using computerized tractors equipped with advanced sensors and GPS, applying customized blends of fertilizer tailored to their exact soil conditions, which helps minimize the runoff of chemicals into nearby waterways. Organic farming can also greatly reduce the use of water and chemicalsby incorporating cover crops, mulches, and compost to improve soil quality, conserve water, and build up nutrients. And replacing inefficient irrigation systems with more precise methods, like subsurface drip irrigation. Advances in both conventional and organic farming can give us more crop per drop from our water and nutrients.
Step four: Shift diets
It would be far easier to feed nine billion people by 2050 if more of the crops we grew ended up in human stomachs. Today only 55 percent of the worlds crop calories feed people directly; the rest are fed to livestock (about 36 percent) or turned into biofuels and industrial products (roughly 9 percent). Though many of us consume meat, dairy, and eggs from animals raised on feedlots, only a fraction of the calories in feed given to livestock make their way into the meat and milk that we consume. For every 100 calories of grain we feed animals, we get only about 40 new calories of milk, 22 calories of eggs, 12 of chicken, 10 of pork, or 3 of beef. Finding more efficient ways to grow meat and shifting to less meat-intensive dietseven just switching from grain-fed beef to meats like chicken, pork, or pasture-raised beefcould free up substantial amounts of food across the world.
Because people in developing countries are unlikely to eat less meat in the near future, given their new found prosperity, we can first focus on countries that already have meat-rich diets. Curtailing the use of food crops for biofuels could also go a long way toward enhancing food availability. By 2050 the worlds population will likely to increase by more than 35 percent. To feed that population, crop production will need to double.
Step five: Reduce waste
An estimated 25 percent of the worlds food calories and up to 50 percent of total food weight are lost or wasted before they can be consumed. In rich countries most of that waste occurs in homes, restaurants, or supermarkets.
In poor countries food is often lost between the farmer and the market, due to unreliable storage and transportation. Consumers in the developed world could reduce waste by taking such simple steps as serving smaller portions, eating leftovers, and encouraging cafeterias, restaurants, and supermarkets to develop waste-reducing measures. Of all of the options for boosting food availability, tackling waste would be one of the most effective.
Taken together, these five steps could more than double the worlds food supplies and dramatically cut the environmental impact of agriculture worldwide. But it wont be easy. These solutions require a big shift in thinking. We need to find a balance between producing more food and sustaining the planet for future generations.
The evolution of aquaculture
The world now produces more farmed fish than beef. Aquaculture has expanded 14 fold since 1980. Farmers are growing everything from premium salmon to humble sea cucumbers. And last year, consumption of farmed fish exceeded consumption of wild fish for the first time, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.
How to farm a better fish
Aquaculture has expanded about 14-fold since 1980. In 2012 its global output, from silvery salmon to sea cucumbers, reached more than 70 million tons - exceeding beef production clearly for the first time and amounting to nearly half of all fish and shellfish consumed on earth.

The family also raises fish in the pond and, in the dry season, rice fertilized by fish wastea polyculture that has tripled output with little environmental downside. Picture by Jim Richardson
Population growth, income growth, and seafoods heart-healthy reputation are expected to drive up demand by 35 percent or more in just the next 20 years. With the global catch of wild fish stagnant, experts say virtually all of that new seafood will have to be farmed.
Natures own water filters, giant Japanese scallops thrive on fish waste at an experimental farm off Canadas Vancouver Island. The farm also uses sea cucumbers and kelp to consume excretions from nearby pens of native sablefish.
Whether youre raising fish in an offshore cage or in a filtered tank on land, you still have to feed them. They have one big advantage over land animals: You have to feed them a lot less.
Fish need fewer calories, because theyre cold-blooded and because, living in a buoyant environment, they dont fight gravity as much. It takes roughly a pound of feed to produce a pound of farmed fish; it takes almost two pounds of feed to produce a pound of chicken, about three for a pound of pork, and about seven for a pound of beef. As a source of animal protein that can meet the needs of nine billion people with the least demand on earths resources, aquacultureparticularly for omnivores like tilapia, carp, and catfishlooks like a good bet.
Pounds for pound
Different sources of animal protein in our diet place different demands on natural resources. One measure of this is the feed conversion ratio: an estimate of the feed required to gain one pound of body mass. By this measure, farming salmon is about seven times more efficient than raising beef.
Fish farmers have been getting more efficient, farming omnivorous fish like tilapia and using feeds that contain soybeans and other grains; salmon feed these days is typically no more than 10 percent fish meal.
The amount of forage fish used per pound of output has fallen by roughly 80 percent from what it was 15 years ago. It could fall a lot further, says Rick Barrows, who has been developing fish feeds at his U.S. Department of Agriculture lab in Bozeman, Montana, for the past three decades. Fish dont require fish meal, says Barrows. They require nutrients. Weve been feeding mostly vegetarian diets to rainbow trout for 12 years now. Aquaculture could get out of fish meal today if it wanted to.
Replacing fish oil remains trickier, because it carries prized omega-3 fatty acids. In the sea theyre made by algae, then passed up the food chain, accumulating in higher concentrations along the way.
Some feed companies are already extracting omega-3s directly from algaethe process used to make omega-3 for eggs and orange juice. An even quicker fix, Stanfords Rosamond Naylor says, would be to genetically modify canola oil to produce high levels of omega-3s.
Farming soars as wild catches stall
With demand rising and many marine fish stocks already overfished, nearly half of all seafood now comes from aquaculture, which has grown at a double-digit clip for decades. Most of the growth is in Asia, home to 90 percent of fish farms. China, the world leader, imports additional fish to make fish oil, fish food, and other products.

Ideals of President, PM made budget easy for all - Finance Minister
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said it was the ideals of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe that were converted into practice through the Budget - 2016.
The minister made this observation when he met a representative gathering of Sri Lankan blue chip companies and other private sector entrepreneurs at a Colombo Hotel yesterday.
Karunanayake speaking at the post budget interactive session said that this year's budget is an unprecedented move to change the landscape of the country through increased public investment and the public-private partnership in many sectors of the economy.
He said the Budget - 2016 has full of benefits and opportunities for both the public and the private sector. The minister said that as he had predicted addressing several pre-budget sessions, the first budget of the Good Governance Government of the President and the Prime Minister, the budget - 2016 is capital oriented and the life of all has been made easy. "Now the government has delivered as it promised. Therefore it is up to you all - the private sector to seize this golden opportunity to be in the saddle of economic drive as the engine of growth," Karunanayake said explaining the opportunities available for the private sector.
The minister explaining the facilities made available for the Public-Private Partnership Projects (PPP) said that impediments that were on the path of of development have been significantly removed.
He said the government targets creating one million jobs with PPPs. "Our laws are archaic and the budget proposed to do away with all such laws. We take all restrictions away to ensure that the private sector plays a pivotal role in economic development," the minister said.
The minister clarifying a statement in the budget proposal said that there were no fee involved for the introduction of Residence Visa to foreign investors. He said that those foreign investors who bring an investment of USD 250,000 will be given residence visa for three years and those bring USD 5 million would be given permanent residence visa with the approval of the Cabinet.
Finance Minister Karunanayake stressing the need of the hour to emulate the Benchmark practices of other developed economies said that geographically Sri Lanka is in the best location, so the government was giving the best opportunity to make the maximum out of it. The government has opened up new sectors, and giving the chance for foreign investors with or without local collaborations to invest in our economy rather than investing elsewhere. Even for those who maintain deposits in foreign countries with no returns, we will ensure 2-3 percent returns if it channelled through banks.
The proposed financial hub would be a key component of the Budget and Minister Karunanayake encouraged key business leaders and other stakeholders present at the post budget session to make use of the most of these fresh opportunities offered by the Budget.
"We are focusing on getting this moving by April, we already have 37 banks and we believe there will be another 10 - 15 banks coming in and that will be a vibrant offshore banking as well as financial hub.
We have opened up our services sector. We want tourism numbers to increase and that is why we are planning to open shopping malls and introduce competitive pricing," Karunanayake said.
When asked about the government restricting the import of electric vehicles in the absence of a proper public transport system, the minister defending the government's move said that the budget has allocated initially Rs. 1,000 million under a proposed "Park and Ride" to facilitate the commuters in terms of comfort and cost. Under this, the minister said that railway and bus transport in selected towns such as Jaela, Avissawella, Panadura, Kadawatha and Piliyandala will be improved.

The Indian government intend to link Varansi (Baranas), the sacred city in India and Sri Lanka's sacred city Kataragama, for the benefit of Buddhists in both countries. The proposed bridge from Thalaimannar to Dhanuskody will enhance the tourism industry in both countries, it was revealed.
Consul General of India in Hambantota, Raj Kumar made this announcement at of a photo exhibition and a film screening of sacred Buddhist places in India, held at the Jayanthi Bodhirajaramaya in Kataragama.The photos were taken by Mitra Weerakoon, the chairman of the Sri Lanka Photographic Society, and were facilitated by the Indian government.
the Indian Consul General Raj Kumar said he was thankful to the temple for hosting the photo exhibition and thanked Provincial Minister Saliya Sumedha Silva for initiating the exhibition to be held at Mulkirimulla, Pokunungala and Yundaganawa. Ven.Kapugama Saranatissa Nayaka Thero said that Buddhists in Sri Lanka have great respect for Buddhist religious places in India, but were not all in a position to go there.
For this reason, he said, the photo exhibition and film screening were of value to them.
Minister Silva noted how it was only when he visited India that he understood the importance of an inter-relationship promoting Buddhist sacred places in India among Buddhists in Sri Lanka.

Jayati Saha: The story-teller with a camera
The colour spattered streets, clothes and faces of India were transported to Colombo this month, through the story-telling talent of Kolkata-based photographer Jayati Saha. Her exhibition, 'Celebrating Life With Colours,' was held from November 15 to 25 at the JDA Perera Gallery, the Harold Peiris Gallery, the Lionel Wendt Art Centre and the University of Kelaniya.
Jayati Saha with Indian Cultural Centre officials
It was organized by the Indian Cultural Centre, in collaboration with the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka, the Open University of Performing Arts and the University of Kelaniya.
Everywhere, people saw true stories from far off places unfold against the walls of galleries - photographs that captured colourful personalities, be it that of a dancer, a widow or a bevy of men celebrating life on the streets.
Although there seemed to be an overall sense of celebration and joy in Saha's exhibits, as most of the photographs featured people covered in the bright reds and yellows of Holi powder, perhaps the most powerful story told was a solemn one of Indian widows.
Manu Ghosh is one such widow photographed by Saha. Her photograph is accompanied by a powerful narrative: "We asked Manu Ghosh what it feels like to be a widow in the ancient holy city of Benares. The look on her face told us... nothing. Because the scriptures solemnly forbid a widow from feeling anything."
The captured images of widows celebrating the Hindu festival of Holi are revolutionary. Saha tells a story seldom told; widows in India are typically in white clothing and shaved heads, having renounced the joys of the world as a tribute to the passing of their husbands. However, in Saha's photographs, they are dancing, covered in colour, bursting with life in a state of absolute surrender and celebration. It is strangely reminiscent of what Deepa Mehta did in the 1990s with her movie 'Water'.
One of my favourites from the exhibition was that of a widow whose white clothes have been doused in bright pink Holi powder, her hand lifted in a gesture of dance, and her lined face a canvas of wondrous emotion - some pain, some joy, and a lot of perseverance.
It was with a pang that we came to the end of our viewing. Every photograph had been a little trailer to some magnificent real-life reel of events that the observer wished they were witness to. Her photographs are evocative and interesting, for being both visually mesmerizing and socially conscious.
Although her street-photography documents well the vibrant bustle of close-knit Indian communities, her strength seems to be portrait photography, in capturing those nanosecond-moments that flicker over the face, or those intense waves of pain and joy that all humans can relate to.
They seem to inspire curiosity in the viewer, a desire to know more about the person, the place and their story - and that is power. You can find and follow more of Jayati Saha's work on Flickr and Facebook.

Until CTU relocation
No heart surgery at Karapitiya hospital
Consultant Cardio Thoracic Surgeon Dr. Namal Gamage attached to the Karapitiya General Hospital told the media that heart surgeries will not be performed at the hospital until the Cardio Thoracic Unit (CTU) is shifted to another location and the surgeries have been suspended due to purely scientific reasons.
According to Dr. Gamage who has performed over 14,000 heart surgeries,it is essential for patients to be kept in a sterilized environment after surgery.
"This is because they are extremely prone to various infections after surgery due to the very low immunity. If a patient gets infected with germs, there is 98 or 99 percent chance of the patient dying. Therefore, such patients should be kept away from all forms of germs," he said. Dr. Gamage said three of the children who underwent heart surgery at the Karapitiya Cardio Thoracic Unit died due to infection.
"At present, there is a three month old infant in my ward in critical condition due to an infection after heart surgery," he said.
"A specialist doctors' team from Guys Hospital, Britain who recently visited the Karapitiya Hospital were appalled after observing the poor hygienic condition in the unit," Dr.Gmage said. He said the prevailing condition cannot be approved at all.
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne visited the unit a few days ago, inspected the condition and promised to relocate the unit.

No increase in utility bills - Finance Ministry
Electricity, water and telephone bills will not increase, the Finance Ministry emphasized. The increase in Value Added Tax (VAT) proposed in the 2016 Budget will have no affect on the utility bills, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
The blanket tax percentage of 11 percent charged at present has been re-bundled into three different tax categories, accordingly prices of a number of essential items will go down, he said.
All retail and bulk sale items which was previously charged VAT at 11 percent will be exempted from VAT according to the new system.
Accordingly prices of all items in the market should go down.
This is apart from prices of the 11 items which were reduced by the budget. Further water, electricity and telecommunication which are essential services provided to the public under government control will also be exempted from VAT, the minister said. Since there would be no VAT charged on these services, the rates of those services will not increase, the Finance Minister claimed.
The 11 percent VAT currently charged on all imported and locally produced items will be reduced to eight percent according to the new proposal, reducing the prices of imported goods as well.
Karunanayake emphasized that there is no truth in the argument presented by some that the price of commodities will increase due to the proposed increase in VAT charge.

An amateur metal detectorist in the UK has made an extraordinary find-a gold-carved ring depicting a nude portrait of Cupid, mythological homewrecker and god of erotic love.
The ring contains a dark onyx and blue engraved nicolo stone, and may once have rested on the finger of a man or woman during the reign of the Roman Empire.
Cupid is also known by his Greek name, Eros, and can be identified in the 1,700-year-old engraving by his short wings.
He leans naked against a spiral column, legs crossed and carrying a torch in one hand.
Discovered near the village of Tangley, the ring is now in the hands of the Hampshire Museums Service and will be put on display at the Andover Museum.
According to Fox Science, who quotes Roman philosopher Apuleius, Cupid was known for 'running at night here and there through homes that are not his own, corrupting marriages through indiscriminate seductions, authoring outrages on an enormous scale-and getting away with it all.'
Images of the frisky god were popular among the Greeks and Romans, and this particular design is characteristic of the fourth century A.D.
The ring was discovered in 2013 and turned in to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, an organisation that was established in 1997 to facilitate reports of artifact discoveries by amateur metal detectorists.
While amateurs are allowed to search for antiques with metal detectors, so long as they remain outside of protected areas, it is required that certain finds be reported to the antiquities authorities.
Writings about Cupid dating back to the second century A.D. and describe him as mischievously seductive, wielding torches, a quiver, a bow and arrows.
He was commonly naked, and any woman pricked by his arrow would fall deeply in love with him.
The story by Apuleius tells of Cupid's love interest, Psyche, who is human and becomes impregnated by the god. Rejected by Cupid's mother, Venus, Psyche takes on impossible tasks to eventually be made immortal.
Artistic depictions of the lovers can be seen dating back 2,500 years.
Sally Worrell, national finds adviser with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, and John Pearce, senior lecturer in archaeology at King's College in London have written about the ring in an article published recently in the journal Britannia -Daily Mail
CUPID, SON OF VENUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL HOMEWRECKER
Tales of Cupid date back to the second century A.D, and tell of his mischievous sexual adventures.
Cupid was commonly naked, to the distaste of his mother, Venus, and was often pictured holding a torch or a bow and arrow.
A story by Apuleius tells of Cupid and his love interest, Psyche, who is deemed unworthy by Venus.
Artistic depictions of the lovers can be seen dating back 2,500 years.
During the Renaissance, Cupid morphed into the cherub-like image that is widely known today.

President instructs to re-impose tax on beer
President Maithripala Sirisena instructed Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to increase the tax imposed on imported beer with less than 5 percent alcohol content, which was reduced in the budget proposals.
As a measure to remove tax discrepancy when importing beer, the Finance Minister reduced the tax on imported beer (less than 5 percent alcohol) from Rs. 190 to Rs. 160 per litre.
However, after considering the effect such a measure could have on the opportunities to promote such beer varieties, the President ordered the Finance Minister to increase the tax to its former status, the Presidents Media Unit stated in a message.

Putin calls Turkeys downing of Russian jet stab in the back
RUSSIA: President Vladimir Putin called Turkey's downing of a Russian fighter jet a stab in the back administered by the accomplices of terrorists, saying the incident would have serious consequences for Moscow's relations with Ankara.
Speaking in the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi on Tuesday before a meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah, Putin said the downed plane had been attacked inside Syria when it was 1 kilometre from the Turkish border and had come down 4 kilometres inside Syria.
That contradicted Turkey's assertion that the aircraft had been warned multiple times that it was straying into Turkish airspace before it was shot down.
Today's loss is linked to a stab in the back delivered to us by accomplices of terrorists. I cannot qualify what happened today as anything else, said a visibly furious Putin.
Our plane was shot down on Syrian territory by an air-to-air missile from an F-16. It fell on Syrian territory 4 kilometres from the Turkish border. It was flying at 6000 metres 1 kilometre from Turkish territory when it was attacked. Putin said Russian pilots and planes had in no way threatened Turkey, but had merely been carrying out their duty to fight Islamic State militants inside Syria. We established a long time ago that large quantities of oil and oil products from territory captured by Islamic State have been arriving on Turkish territory, he said, saying that was how militants had been funding themselves.
And now we get stabbed in our back and our planes, which are fighting terrorism, are struck. This despite the fact that we signed an agreement with our American partners to warn each other about air-to-air incidents and Turkey ... announced it was allegedly fighting against terrorism as part of the US coalition.
If Islamic State militants earned hundreds of millions of dollars from trading oil and enjoyed the protection of the armed forces of entire governments no wonder, said Putin, they behaved so boldly.
We will, of course, analyse everything that happened and today's tragic events will have serious consequences for Russo-Turkish relations, he said. Turkey is one of the most popular holiday destinations for Russians, and the two countries enjoy active diplomatic relations.
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is due to visit Turkey on Wednesday, in a trip arranged before the incident, while Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan is scheduled to visit Russia for talks with Putin in December.
Putin expressed anger at Turkey's decision to convene a meeting of NATO to discuss the incident, suggesting Ankara should instead have swiftly tried to contact Moscow.

Range Bandara clashes with Mahinda Samarasinghe over appointment of VTI chairman
State Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Palitha Range Bandara, yesterday lashed out at the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Mahinda Samarasinghe's move to appoint retired Major General Gamini Hettiarachchi as Chairman of the Vocational Training Institute (VTI).
Minister Range Bandara asked under which principle of the Yahapalanaya that Minister Samarasinghe deemed suitable to designate Hettiarachchi for the above post and who directed the so-called Special Operations Room under Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to inflict defeat on Maithripala Sirisena at the January 8, Presidential Election.
Minister Mangala Samaraweere has lodged a complaint with the Criminal Investigation Department concerning this Special Operation Room where they have reportedly hatched anti-state conspiracies to prevent current President Sirisena from coming to power, he pointed out.
How did Minister Samarasinghe feel disposed to appoint the person who supervised activities in that room as the chairman of a key state institutionhe queried.
He made these comments on being asked if the appointment of retired Major General Hettiarachchi, was made with the approval of the President's office.
The minister said, he never meant to speak on this matter, but it would be interesting to ascertain whether anybody approved the appointment from the Presidential Task Committee and the identity of that person.
He also said that there were media reports during that time that the retired Army Generals who worked at that Gotabhaya led Special Operations Room were handsomely rewarded by Avant Garde.
We all know that Mahinda Samarasinghe campaigned democratically to ensure Mahinda Rajapaksa's victory at the Presidential election. However, it was not so with some the others. They employed thuggery, he said.
One has to consider whether Minister Samarasinghe's appointee directed this facility - the Special Operations Room on behalf of the country or of Rajapaksa, he pointed out.
Asked if he had ever sat with Minister Samarasinghe to discuss matters pertaining to vocational training and skills development, Bandara said he had never been called for such discussions.
There was no such consensus so to speak, Bandara said.
Minister Samarasinghe had said said that he had conceded various duties and responsibilities in writing. If he had done so, it should have been announced through the Gazette. Only the Prime Minister had conceded subjects that come under his purview to relevant state ministers in that manner so far, he said.

River turbines turn Austrias Danube from blue to green
AUSTRALIA: The Wachau, a picture-postcard river valley in Austria, makes a lot of wine. Soon it could be producing its own electricity too, and in a way that will not spoil the stunning views.
Wind turbines are out of the question and solar panels are strictly regulated, says Andreas Nunzer, mayor of picturesque Spitz on the left bank of the Danube river.
But we have found a way to contribute to the fight against global warming without harming our quality of life. It is called river current power.
The idea is to place in the river what looks on the surface like the top of a submarine but is in fact a six-tonne buoy producing enough electricity for 250 people.
Below the waves is a turbine turned by the fast-flowing waters -- more brown than the blue of Strauss's famous waltz -- of the Danube, one of Europe's main waterways.
So far, three prototype river turbines producing between 40 and 80 gigawatts of electricity have been tested in the Wachau, but Nunzer has ambitious plans.
We have obtained all the necessary permits to have nine of them, and we don't plan to stop there. We're just waiting for mass production, he told AFP.

Scherzinger 'dating tennis hunk'
Former Pussycat Doll has started dating another sports star after her split from Lewis Hamilton.
The Sun reports that the 34-year-old is dating Bulgarian tennis player Grigor Dimitrov, who broke off his two-year relationship with Maria Sharapova earlier this year.
Sources tell the paper the Don't Cha singer and the tennis player have been dating since July.
"They're completed besotted with each other. But they've been careful not to be pictured together because they don't want the pressure of the relationship being in the public eye," the source claimed.
Scherzinger dated Formula 1 star Hamilton, 30, for seven years before splitting in February.
They remain close friends however.
For her birthday this year, Hamilton posted a picture of the pair and a friendly note.
"Dear friend, Through the years we shared alot, i wouldn't have changed a thing. All the experiences made me the man i'm proud to be right now. The Memories together will never be taken away no matter how old we get and I'm thankful for the time we had. I'm wishing you the Happiest of Birthdays, and may God continue to Bless you in all that you do.#waayyyupstayblessed"
"Lewis knows and is very unhappy. It's made him realise he isn't over her. He's been desperately trying to talk to Nicole over the last few weeks," the source adds.
Scherzinger also briefly dated Swiss footballer Pajtim Kasami, 23.
Dimitrov previously dated Serena Williams before moving on to her rival Sharapova.

Shahid Kapoor preferred Kareena over Alia Bhatt in Udta Punjab
Now that Shandaar has come and gone without a whimper, all eyes are on Shahid Kapoor's next. Early next year, Shahid and Alia Bhatt are coming together once again, with Kareena Kapoor Khan in a special appearance for Udta Punjab. Our source reveals, "The makers are eyeing an early 2016 release for Udta Punjab. It will release mostly around February-end or in March."
Shahid calls it a 'special film'. He says, "Udta Punjab on paper might seem dark and edgy, but once you see that film, I can assure you it's the kind of role any actor would die for. When I heard the script, I instantly agreed. There were three other characters and we were waiting for them to be cast. Nobody was saying yes to the film and we could not start. It took some time for the film to get cast."
After sitting through the narration, the first thing Shahid did was recommend Bebo's name to director Abhishek Chaubey. "Actually, I never wanted to recommend Kareena because I was scared thinking about how people will perceive that again. When I was narrated the film, I thought of Kareena even before Alia. The role that Kareena plays, I felt she was just perfect for the role." Bebo being Bebo took her own sweet time to give her nod for a script reading session. Shahid continues, "But then somehow, maybe Kareena was not free and it got a bit delayed. Then somehow within that month, Kareena heard the script and said yes to the film. It kind of happened and I felt really happy when it did."
About Alia, he says, "Initially, when Kareena didn't have time for the narration, I told Alia that woh role ki casting toh nahi ho rahi hai, tu yeh role karegi kya She read that role and she said she really liked it." Shahid's all praise for both his co-actors. Alia's performance in the film 'bowled' him over, "Alia has an amazing role in the film. In fact, everyone's role in that film is incredibly good. But at that point of time, maybe I had just learnt to take risks with Haider paying off I have become a little more fearless. A lot of people were not confident enough to take up a film like Udta Punjab and it required a lot of confidence as an actor and as a star because as a star, you are doing things to surprise the people and you don't know how they will eventually react. As an actor, all roles are very challenging. When I told Alia to go through it, I felt Alia is as much an actor as she is a star. So therefore she would understand what potential that content had and she did."
What about Kareena "Obviously, I feel she's the best thing about the film because I was the one to give her name and I think highly of her as an actor," he signs off.

South Korea webtoon craze making global waves
SOUTH KOREA: Seoul office worker Park Sun-Min constantly checks his smartphone -- trawling for updates on an insect apocalypse, ghost soldiers haunting the inter-Korean border, and a supermarket worker's struggle to form a trade union.
Along with millions of other South Koreans, Park is, by his own admission, irrevocably hooked on the vast network of varied Internet-based comic strips -- or webtoons -- available through his mobile.
I read four to five a day and more than 30 a week ... I sometimes see them at work and keep reading them on holiday -- even overseas, the 30-year-old said.
The genre is a growing cultural force in South Korea, supported by an ultra-fast internet and smartphone-crazy populace, and fuelled by a small army of young, creative, tech-savvy graphic artists.
Most webtoon serials are published on major Internet portals free of charge and once or twice a week. They cover pretty much every genre, from romantic comedies to horror, via historical epics and crime.
Their popularity has drawn the attention of the wider entertainment industry, and top rated webtoons have been successfully adapted into TV dramas, films, online games -- even musicals.
According to Digieco, a Seoul-based technology think tank, the market for webtoons, and their derivatives, is currently valued at around 420 billion won ($368 million) and is expected to more than double to 880 billion won by 2018.
A recent example of the sort of stellar trajectory a webtoon can take was provided by Misaeng (or Incomplete Life) -- a highly-acclaimed series about a young part-time worker trying to survive South Korea's cutthroat corporate culture.
The twice-weekly comic built up an Internet readership of one million, and the series was collated in a book version that sold two million copies.
A TV drama spin-off was a major hit last year, and the final accolade came when the government named a new piece of legislation to help part-time workers after the webtoon's main character.
I think this is a distinctive genre ... and the market is exploding at a mind-blowing pace, said Cha Jung-Yoon, a spokesman for Naver -- Seoul's top Internet portal.
South Korea had a traditional comics industry which all but collapsed during the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis that drove many publishers into bankruptcy.
But the internet opened a new door. Naver launched a dedicated webtoon section in 2005, commissioning three artists whose work attracted 10,000 views a day.
The section now boasts more than 220 commissioned artists and 7.5 million daily views, Cha said, adding that 75 percent of readers are aged 20 or older.
Most webtoons are created digitally, often in long-strip format for scroll-down viewing on computers or smartphones.
Many contain moving, flashing or 3D images as well as sound effects and background music. Some even make the smartphone vibrate when readers scroll to a certain scene.
Webtoons are not simply scanned versions of print comics. It's a whole new, different genre tailored for the internet age, said Kim Suk, senior researcher at state-run Korea Creative Content Agency.
The introduction of smartphones in 2009 was a watershed moment for webtoons ... it really fuelled their growth, Kim said. More than 80 percent of the South's 51 million population own smartphones, allowing fans to read webtoons anywhere, and they have become particularly popular with commuters.
Seok-Woo became a full time webtoon artist after a series he devised -- a psychological thriller about school bullying -- won a 2007 competition to publish a regular series on Naver.
The 32-year-old, who writes under his given name, grew up in a family that moved a lot when he was a teenager, leaving him feeling friendless and isolated.
Many artists blend their own life experiences into the story and that often resonates well with readers, he told AFP.
Action heroes are relatively rare -- often the most popular webtoons are those dealing with issues like poverty, cyber bullying, suicide, youth unemployment, and domestic violence.
With fan bases growing, dozens of webtoon creators earn six-figure US dollar incomes, made up of fees from Internet portals and advertisers, as well as licensing contracts for TV shows, films and other adaptations. A handful of A-listers appear on TV talk shows, attend mass signing events with fans and give motivational speeches to cartooning hopefuls.

## Title: Spaces with emotions
## Supertitle: [Archworld]
## Section: Features

[Archworld]
Spaces with emotions
"The importance of creating is evoking emotions. If you can make a space that can evoke a person's emotions and you can feel it in your five senses, that is where an architect becomes successful."
Evoking emotions through architecture got into her blood relatively late during her education. Initially, her parents wanted her to become a doctor. However, Peshali Perera had other ideas. In doing so, the field of architecture gained a fine and wise architect. Arch World features Peshali Perera, who has provided us with insights into the art of making spaces.
The first and second years at the University of Moratuwa Architectural Faculty seemed a little lax. Campus life was not ideal as the attention one gets is less. But Perera received the much needed confidence and encouragement from very good tutors who lectured her batch in the third year. With her designs being appreciated, she felt sure of herself and felt great about her work. Since then she has never looked back.
A person's religiosity can play a great role in creating spaces. One's beliefs about the human spirit or the soul can have an impact on architecture. Architecture can be secular and it can be spiritual. The next life has a bearing on the architecture in this lifetime. Call it Karma or call it God - the answers humans search in their journey of self- discovery must also be incorporated in the designs of his or her earthly abode.
"A spiritual space is subjective to a person's personality. He or she may want a spiritual space where he or she can experience certain things. An architect has to understand what a person needs to experience in a particular space. A person may need a space to contemplate or be calm. He/she may want dim lighting or require fresh air. Accordingly, we research to provide the required environment or ambience. You don't have to invent the wheel. There are certain things that we can look at and be inspired. We study those things and create that space for the client," Perera said.
Spirituality aside, if you are lackadaisical about architecture, you won't make it to the top.
"If you don't have the passion, you can never do architecture. It is a tedious course and a tedious way of life. Throughout your education and practice, you need a lot of involvement. This is because it has to do with someone else's taste. You need to respond to people, the climate and community. It is personal, climatic and social," Perera added.
Getting into someone's shoes seems to be something that she is adept at. "People have different aspirations and lives. Personalities differ. You have to understand somebody personally and get into their shoes to understand what they need. There are buildings which need to respond to the climate, social context and community. But the building will be used by people. If the buildings do not address the issues of a person, they won't work. If it doesn't evoke the emotions of a person, that building might not work," Perera pointed out.
The idea of learning architecture is to learn things related to people. This can be challenging and is a never-ending process of learning because the world is constantly changing.
"The spaces are always related to a need. This is necessary for the building to function. If I am designing a house, it needs to feel like a house. It should not feel like a spiritual space. Some people can come up with the idea that they want the house to be a spiritual space. But primarily, you respond to a function. If it is a house, it needs to have the proper privacy. It needs to have the proper spaces so you can feel relaxed. Spaces are all created in accordance with the necessity of that moment," Perera said.
If it is a community building, we want people to come and interact with each other. Therefore, you need to create a comfortable space where a person can come and interact freely. It should not be forced.
When you build a house, you build a secure future for those dearest to you. You build an enclosure that protects your loved ones. It is more than walls and a roof. It contains memories. Above all, it is trust and unity. It is sacred to you and your family.
"Most people have all kinds of ideas when it comes to building houses. Either they have seen it in a magazine or they have come across similar creations in another house. These ideas are a part of their lifestyles. You have to understand their lifestyles. You are not designing a house but you are designing a lifestyle. That is what we believe in. The little things they say are a part of their lifestyle. Therefore, it is important to identify their lifestyle to recreate into the design," Perera said.

Tax relief measures cost government dearly
The Government will lose over Rs 50,000 million annually by the budgetary decision to reduce taxes, Tax Consultant P. Guruge said.
The government has taken measures with Budget 2016 to reduce taxes aiming to provide relief to the public and ease the cost of living burden.
Guruge added that this is the largest tax relief in the history of the country's budget.
"However, it is regrettable that a few opposition members, who cry that the government has increased taxes through the budget, cannot see this situation. They cannot see that the government stands to lose millions through the decision of tax reduction with a view bring relief to the people" he noted.
He further said the government will lose Rs 25,000 million by lifting VAT and Rs 6,000 million by reduction of Company Tax. The government will lose another Rs 8,000 million by the reduction of withholding tax on interest. The government will lose another Rs 7,500 million through all the other reductions and abolishing of taxes bringing a total amount of Rs 50,800 million annually.
Guruge noted that the tax relief limit for a person was Rs. 500,000 while the limit for an employee was Rs 750,000 so far. But, the tax relief limit has been increased to Rs 2.4 million with this budget.
"Why has the opposition failed to understand the extent of relief granted by the government for tax payers," he questioned.

Victoria Beckham Gushes about 'Romantic' David Beckham
Despite being responsible for the cutest family around, David and Victoria Beckham are constantly plagued with split rumours, with many ominous sources and mysterious insiders trying to claim that all is not well behind the scenes.
However, Victoria has once again gushed about how much she ruddy loves her husband, her family, and her life - and if this isn't enough to silence the haters then we have no idea what is.
Speaking to People magazine, the fashion tycoon explained: "David is very romantic and we regularly do lovely things to surprise each other.
"The first time I met David, nearly 20 years ago, we were at a football match. After the game all the other players were having a drink with their friends and David was standing with his mum and dad and his younger sister Joanne. Family is important to him.
"When he proposed he asked my dad first, which is such a respectful thing to do."
Alright, Vic, we're already seriously jealous that you are the one lucky enough to be married to him - no need to rub it in.
The star also revealed that even though she and her hubby are busy being two of the most famous people on the planet, they always dedicate time to their four children, 16-year-old Brooklyn, 13-year-old Romeo, 10-year-old Cruz, and four-year-old Harper, adding: "Both of us have to travel with work, but we always make time for each other and time for the children.
"We always support each other and our family."
Meanwhile, David, who was named People's sexiest man alive last week, revealed that when he told his kids about his award they all burst out laughing.
He shared: "We kind of laughed about it with the boys and the boys kind of laughed at me and said, 'Really! Sexiest man alive Really'
"My oldest son, Brooklyn was the one who was like, 'Are you sure it's not me that's meant to be there today'"
And with Brooklyn fast-approaching his dad's level of fame, we wouldn't be surprised if he is the one to nab that title from his pops in a few years time.

What SL accomplished at Geneva
Some politicians and a section of their retinue seem to misinterpret the recent Sri Lanka co-sponsored United Nations Human Rights Council Resolutions in Geneva as a threat to the sovereignty of the state of Sri Lanka. Their illogical and unreasonable arguments seem to be an attempt to mystify and bamboozle a section of the innocent people of this country.
As we all know, the attitude of the UN Human Rights Council was not favourable to Sri Lanka during the period of the previous government. We then lost the vote in Geneva and were granted time till March 2015.
The inevitable next step would have been the imposition of economic sanctions - but not the misleading, rhetoric and manipulated, slogan of the electric chair on the eve of most elections.
We had already been deprived of the GSP+ concession. Our fish exports to the European market had been banned. Restoration of these concessions is in the offing following the January 8 election and especially after the Geneva Resolutions.
The deprivation of GSP+ by the US was a significant obstacle to our garment industry and foreign exchange earnings. The next step would have been imposition of various major economic sanctions. It is the poor in this country who suffers most in a situation like that.
Thus, the functioning of the UN Human Rights Commission is not a novel arrangement orchestrated to trap Sri Lanka, as some people inadvertently or ignorantly or maliciously propagate.
Universal Declaration of Human Rights emerged following the proclamation by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948, whereas the Charter of the United Nations signed on June 26, 1945, in San Francisco and came into force on October 24, 1945.
All member countries were called upon: to publicize the text of the Human Rights Declaration of 1948 and to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction based on the political status of countries or territories.
Now, in our country, those who disagree with the Geneva resolutions, inter alia, raised the following three basic issues probably with a view to give vent to their own interpretation.
1. Interfering with the sovereignty of the state
2. Creating a hybrid judiciary
3. Entertaining foreign expertise into the country.
When we answer the above questions succinctly within the confines of this space, the first question Sovereignty of a state is meaningful only when it binds itself with other states, organizations in the performance of reciprocal duties and obligations. We are bound by the UN Charter; Human Right Commissions covenants etc, and we are expected to respect them and uphold them. We have pledged to do so (even individual liberty has its limitations to respect the liberty of other individuals and rest of the society). Eminent political scientists such as Prof. Harold Laski, Prof. Krishna Peasanna, Mukerji prefer the notion of Supremacy to sovereignty. Mukerji in his celebrated work The State, ventures to suggest his ethico-evolutionary definition of the state and he advocated legal supremacy as against sovereignty.
Hybrid judiciary
Regarding the hybrid judiciary issue, it is pertinent to draw the attention to our constitution: Establishment of courts is governed by section 105(1) (a),(b),(c) of the constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. Further, Section 105(2) ensures, that: ............Parliament may replace or abolish, or amend the powers, jurisdiction and procedure of, such courts, tribunals and institutions. Similarly, section 7 of article 2 of the Charter of the United Nations clearly states that: Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state.
Entertaining foreign expertise seeking expert opinion on a matter of importance is an ad-hoc arrangement made by most countries whenever necessity demands. This facility was made use of during the time of Paranagama Commission too.
Historically, foreign experts of varied disciplines carried out reconnaissance missions on our invitation or on their own and nobody objected to their presence. For example, a team of world renowned economists visited this country in 1960s, familiarized with the economic situation of the country and prepared individual invaluable advisory papers covering macro-economic issues substantiated by micro-economic concepts. Thus, the compilation named Papers By Visiting Economists emerged.
Yet another criticism by some dissidents is that our representatives had failed to bargain in Geneva in 2015 with regard to co-sponsored resolutions and had simply agreed to said resolutions in toto. In this instance, we should not be unreasonable as to forget that the subsequent co-sponsored resolutions had dropped the names of forty eight persons embodied in the UN Human Rights Commissioners resolutions. As the removal of those 48 names from the UNHRCs resolutions being a major triumph, perhaps bargaining any further on the remaining solvable matters would have been treated as unethical, irrational and provocative.
United we cherish divided we perish
At this crucial juncture, what is needed is reconciliation and not conflict: unity and not division: consolation and not creating fear psychosis in the country, making unduly use of arsenal of invective, kindling chauvinism. We want ethical, religious and political harmony, justice and fairplay and not distrust, fear and divisiveness. Our country needs statesmen and not mere politicians manoeuvring for power and self aggrandizement.
Untiring efforts, tact, diplomacy, goodwill and non-alignment of the trio: the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister, brought about a renaissance in friendship, good relations and recognition amongst most nations of the world and the resultant progressive and cheerful image may be highly productive in our present and future relations with Geneva.

Will Presidency actually revert to its ceremonial role

Last weeks announcement by President Maithripala Sirisena that he would commence the process of abolishing the Executive Presidency, though not wholly unexpected given the pledges he made during his election campaign, adds an entirely new dimension to the political equation.
The President had re-iterated his commitment during the funeral of Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera. The late prelates political ideology in later years revolved around abolishing the Executive Presidency. It was no secret that Ven. Sobitha Thera, who was instrumental in initiating and invigorating the political movement that eventually led to the ouster of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, was at the time of his passing unhappy at the pace at which the government was moving on proposed political reforms.
The President submitted to Cabinet last week a memorandum not only to abolish the Executive Presidency but also to institute electoral reforms. The matter will be dealt with by a committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. A six-month timeframe was set to draft and present the reforms although there was agreement that any reforms would be enacted at the conclusion of President Sirisenas term of office and in time for the next general election, both not being due until 2020.
Constitutional changes
The government, though theoretically a partnership between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) is essentially a government of convenience, despite the good working relationship that exists between the UNP and the President who has repeatedly acknowledged that he was able to assume office only because of UNP votes.
The UNP is seeking a partnership with the SLFP because they lack an absolute majority in Parliament. Having the support of their rivals provides them with a two-thirds majority in Parliament which allows the UNP to enact the constitutional changes it was seeking to introduce. That the party opted to work with the SLFP as a party instead of wooing a handful of SLFPers - which would have provided them with a simple majority in Parliament - underscores the importance the UNP attaches to this agenda.
The SLFP is in partnership with the UNP with a greater degree of reluctance. A faction of the party which is still loyal to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa dislike this arrangement and are constantly expressing their frustration. Their latest move comes in the form of a proposed motion of no confidence against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayakas budget which was unveiled last week. If this motion becomes a reality, the spectacle of a section of the SLFP sponsoring the motion and another group opposing it may become a reality!
The other faction of the party is in government at the behest of President Sirisena. Some of them, such as ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and S.B. Dissanayake take every opportunity to remind the public that they are part and parcel of a government headed by the President and not one led by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Also, most SLFPers, after enjoying ministerial perks for 20 straight years, are loath to part with their powers and privileges and are happy to be accommodated in the government rather than in the opposition.
SLFP campaign
Where would the abolition of the Executive Presidency leave the two parties It will be recalled that at his inauguration at Independence Square, President Sirisena pledged that he would not seek another term of office as President. If the Presidency is abolished, this would of course become a reality.
However, this has also led to speculation that his intention is to contest and lead the SLFP at the next general elections with the objective of becoming an executive Prime Minister in the next Parliament. It has been suggested that the Local Government elections, where the President has promised to lead the SLFP campaign, would be a trial run for this exercise.
However, this is unlikely because it is a scenario that will be played out in five years time. The Sri Lankan political landscape is constantly changing and it is impossible to predict how political alignments will shift in that period of time.
Also, it is quite possible that in five years, Rajapaksa, for now content to remain as a backbencher in the SLFP representing the Kurunegala district, will make another bid to lead the party because there is no bar for him to become Prime Minister. Rajapaksa would be 75 years of age by then but he would surely likely to ensure the political future of his son Namal Rajapaksa and the best way of doing this would be to try and lead the party once again. Therefore, even if President Sirisena harbours any hopes of leading the party at a general election in 2020, the opposition may come from within rather than the UNP. And, he will be then bearing the burden of incumbency as well.
The other interesting factor that would come in to play following last weeks announcement of proposed constitutional reforms are the changes to the electoral system. It will be recalled that after President Sirisena assumed office in January and installed a minority UNP government, while there was a general urgency to repeal the 18th Amendment to the Constitution and replace it with the 19th Amendment, there was a sharp division of opinion regarding the proposed 20th Amendment which envisaged electoral reforms.
At the time, the SLFP parliamentary group, egged on by Rajapaksa loyalists, insisted on coupling the 19th and 20th Amendments if they were to support the changes but deft political manoeuvring by the President and the Prime Minister ensured the passage of the 19th Amendment, albeit with some changes. The 20th Amendment is still in limbo.
The bone of contention between the two parties was what shape and form the changes to the electoral system would take, despite there being a consensus between the two major parties that the system would be a mix between the first past the post Westminster system and the proportional representation (PR) system.
The SLFP believes that in the hybrid system, a dominance of the Westminster system would be to its advantage. The UNP believes that giving more weightage to the PR system would be beneficial to its interests. This argument holds true at present because an analysis of the results at the last general election in August shows that the SLFP was ahead in most electorates.
However, the two major parties must know that aligning themselves with a preference for one system or another is a dangerous tactic. Which party benefits depends on the mood of the electorate and matters can go horribly wrong, if a party miscalculates strategy. For example, former President J.R. Jayewardene introduced the PR system believing that it would be to the UNPs eternal advantage. The party finds that it is not so, although it has saved the UNP from a complete rout at, for instance, the 2010 general election.
It is noteworthy that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is heading the committee on constitutional reforms. The Premier has been in Parliament since 1977, when Jayewardene first introduced the presidential system for parliamentary approval and then lived through the perils and pitfalls of the Executive Presidency culminating in President Rajapaksa arrogating powers to himself that many saw as autocratic and excessive. Now he is tasked with turning back the clock and returning to a system of government that would be led by a Prime Minister with the possibility of the President being relegated to a ceremonial role. It is an arduous task but one which he is probably the best suited to handle.

Ragaya Nodutu Ruwa
You forget, she remembers!
Unbridled, unrestrained and uncontrolled lust is what leads men and women to commit crimes of passion and sexual violence. Even though the level of education in individuals is different, most in society have received at least the basic education. Yet, some manage to live without committing crimes of passion while others are unable to do so. The reason is 'empathy'. This is the power to recognize and understand the pain and suffering of others which we would not want to go through. Certain people are unable to empathize.
Often, there are groups of boys who taunt girls in buses. This is harassment. They are unable to empathize. Rape is committed due to the inability to relate to the pain and humiliation a woman goes through at the hands of a rapist. Child abuse is the inability to understand the fear and shame a child experiences. This is complete lack of empathy.

'Ragaya Nodutu Ruwa,' a workshop conducted by the English Department of the Sri Jayewardenepura University recently provided a platform for a discourse on Gender Based Violence and Sexuality.
Centre for Gender Studies Deputy Director Dr. Anusha Edirisinghe explained that Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV) is the physical, mental and sexual harassment that one person may commit on another. This harassment has a psychological impact.
"SGBV is often associated with power. Therefore, there is a need to change attitudes with regard to patriarchy. Otherwise, the problem will persist. Today, there are many reports in the media and a lot of awareness. Now there are investigations," Dr. Edirisinghe said.
She added that SGBV must be regarded as a crime and must be reported. "We see this problem escalating. One reason is the use of digital technology. Youngsters need to be careful especially when using social media such as Facebook," she pointed out.
With regard to cyber space, digital technology and mobile phones figure prominently. Pornography through digital technology is a serious problem. With this temptation and carnal desires awaken.
When abuse occurs, the common excuse is that the girl was dressed immodestly. Here, one must realize that the girl's immodestly is not the problem. The problem lies with the carnal desire of the man. The girl's dress may not be in keeping with culture, but the problem is the motive of the man.
"In Sri Lanka, SGBV is not discussed in families. But I feel that from a very young age boys and girls should be educated on SGBV. Love and emotion should be taught from Montessori. In Western countries, children are taught about respecting others and securing rights. In Sri Lanka, these are not taught. Gender sensitive people should be created from Montessori," Dr. Edirisinghe said.
Dr. Dammika Ariyarathne, Senior Lecturer at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Consultant Medical Officer spoke about facing adversity and overcoming obstacles.
"Regardless of our paper qualifications and degrees, what is our goal in life We need to understand what we are living for and the reason we have worked so hard. If we have no aims and direction, we would lose what we have accumulated over the years," said Dr. Ariyarathne.
Dr. Ariyarathne stressed that we can place value on our lives through self-control and honesty. Then we can achieve success in life.
"Most of you make mistakes during your youth. You will ruin your future if you do not place importance on your youth. You also need to give due recognition to your middle age. Don't forget this important stage in your life. My advice is to build a foundation for your middle age and old age during your youth. The way you live your old age is your responsibility. Your professors can advise you on this but you have to make the decision," Dr. Ariyarathne added.
"Life is about learning from mistakes. Do not wallow on your sad memories. You triumph in life through experience. Your future depends on how you live your present. The decisions you take now will influence your future. My life is successful because of the values I grew up with. If there is a girl or a boy who lives life aimlessly then that will be the future he or she will live out," Dr. Ariyarathne said.
Life flows in a zigzag pattern. One day you will be happy and the next day you may be in the doldrums. Failure and bad experience in life does not mean the end of life. Happiness will follow unhappiness. Resolve your issues in this manner. Develop your problem solving skills. Move on, she added.
Dr. Ariyarathene pointed out: "Fear has been found to be the leading cause of unhappiness in life. If you had an abortion, you may feel unworthy. Live your life in the present without complicating the entire issue. Life is the way we face every single moment."
