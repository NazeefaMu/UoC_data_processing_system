Govt. wont privatise Mattala, but will make it a profit earning venture
The government will not privatise the Mattala International Airport, but there is a burning need to convert it as a profit earning venture as it had already become a burden on the economy of the country, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
The Minister said so, addressing a gathering at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday after commissioning the renovated runway for 24 hour air traffic operations.
The Minister added that the countrys resources cannot be offered to other countries and it cannot be accepted.
Under the project, the runway has been relayed so as to meet international standards and moreover to handle all sizes of aircraft ever built in the world including A380 Airbus.
The rehabilitated runway, was opened yesterday at 12.37 p.m. with the arrival of a new SriLankan flight UL-1162 from Trivandrum.
The construction of the overlay work commenced on schedule on January 6, 2017 and had been scheduled to be completed on April 6. The daunting task of operations during this period was managed while ensuring the right level of security and safety within the airport premises with the least hassle to the passengers, airlines and cargo operations. The rehabilitated runway is able to accommodate A380s Airbus as the width of the runway has been increased to 75 metres from 60 metres, the Minister noted.
The Netherlands Airport Consultants (NACO) has carried out the design and supervision consultancy while the overlaying was carried out by a Chinese company named CATIC at a cost of Rs.7.2 billion.
Minister de Silva added that the officials of the International Civil Aviation Organisation recommended an overlaying of the runway to improve runway surface condition for safe operations of aircraft since no major rehabilitation work had been carried out on the runway after the airport was commissioned in 1985.
The runway of BIA is upgraded to modified Code F compliance, aerodrome Ground Lighting of the Runway and Taxiway system of BIA upgraded to CAT II as per ICAO, all of the new installation will be energy efficiency LED Light system, surface movement guidance system to the Runway and taxiway systems, new airfield light control and monitoring system, all Runway markings as per ACI new addition, and capacity of Runway system will be enhanced to meet the next 20 year growth.
Addressing the gathering the minister said that yesterday was a red letter day in aviation history of the country as it is was a major step taken towards the aviation sector development.
Minister de Silva said that he joined this good governance government not to lick bones but to work for the country and the people.

SL to auction 18 Port City blocks by August 2018
Sri Lanka will auction the first 18 blocks of the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) and Port City by mid next year, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said.
He said work is progressing rapidly now and he was confident that the first fully developed 18 blocks will be ready by 2018 August to be internationally tendered for investments for a 99 year lease.
In 2016 the Port City project was added in the Megalopolis plan and the government which planned an International Finance Center in Colombo together with the Urban Development Authority (UDA) and the CHEC Port City Colombo signed the new agreement in August 12, 2016.
Speaking at function at the Waters Edge Ranawaka said the delay in the project was due to the fact that the fresh environmental study that was redone after the change of government took 18 months. But this was necessary for environmental constraints and accordingly several structural changes were done.
The Minister also said that Sri Lanka today has lost the competitive edge it enjoyed a few years ago in cheap labour and this has now gone to India, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Due to this we have to look at other alternative areas to generate revenue and the International Financial City is one such venture.
The Minister said that Megalopolis will also look at utilizing the inland canal transportation in Colombo city and several project plans have being identified and they would be given to the private sector to build and operate. (PPP)
One of the first projects would be the passenger boat service from Beira Lake to the National Hospital.
The Minister said they foresee tremendous investments coming from the global banking sector for the proposed financial center as there is no such facility in the region.

The Executive Committee of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has decided not to intervene in the appointment of R. Kannan to the High Court.
The BASL Executive Committee which met on April 5, studied the recommendations put forward by the expert committee consisting of past presidents who looked into the appointment and decided they would need to study the matter further, said BASL Secretary, Amal Randeniya yesterday. One of the recommendations put forward by the expert committee was that there was no just cause in asking for the removal of the judge as he had not violated Article 111 (2) of the Constitution which deals with the removal of judges.
Randeniya also explained that since the BASL had also earlier stated that they did not recommend such an appointment, they would now not intervene to either ask for his removal or continuance. The Judges Association however in a letter written to the BASL on April 4 has asked for an appointment to meet with the BASL over Kannan and Randeniya said that the meeting would most probably be arranged after the New Year.

Addressing a press conference at the Organisation of Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo yesterday he said that accident services, maternity hospitals, childrens hospitals, the cancer hospital, Kidney Hospital and dialysis units and places where dengue affected child patients are being treated in the Trincomalee district will not be affected by the strike and all the services will continue in them. The services will continue in those institutions without any interruption.
According to Dr. Zoysa, politicians have been trying to legalize a fraudulent company using children as a shield. SAITM is just another `Sakvithi type business which needs to be dealt with under the law. Usually while implementing the law, the culprits receive punishment first and then the justice is done to the victims.
A lot of things can be done in Sri Lanka using money and the SAITM owner shows the power of his money. We have one question for the Health Minister. We ask him whether he is against the President. When the President was the Health Minister he clearly opposed and stated his stand on SAITM. 147 years old standards of medical education protected by Sri Lanka Medical Council has been challenged in the courts because of the Health Minister and he should tender his resignation, he said.

Tertiary education in non-state degree awarding institutions:
Interest free loans will be granted to 4,000 students who wish to pursue tertiary education in non-state degree awarding institutions.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has instructed the authorities to select candidates for the loan programme from the 2014 and 2015 A/L results.
The proposal initially put forward in the Budget 2017, was approved by the Cabinet this week. The Budget 2017, proposed to initiate an interest free loan facility up to a maximum limit of Rs. 800,000 per student for those who are unable to enter the state universities due to their Z scores.
The loans will be granted by a financial institution. Students are required to repay the loan in instalments after obtaining the degree.
Six degree awarding institutions have come forward with the given criteria to offer degrees. The loan will be available for the subject areas of: Business Management (HRM), Logistic Management, Project Management, Industrial Management, Business Communication, Accounting and Finance, Management Information System, Multimedia, Banking and Finance, Insurance and Risk Management, Regional Science and Planning, Software Engineering, Logistic and Transportation, Art (English), Business Management ,Marketing, Education, Information Technology, IT in Network and Mobile Computing, Medical Science, Medical Science in Acupuncture, Biomedical Science, Psychology, Accounting and Multimedia.
Of the opportunities available, a majority of the places, i.e. 2,600 has been offered by the National School of Business Management (NSBM).
The Government has also chosen the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) as the financial organisation to grant the loan as it was considered to be the least cost option for the government in terms of the interest cost for the scheme.
According to the proposal submitted by the BOC, the loan facility has a four year grace period and eight year repayment period. If the degree programme is limited to three years, the loan amount is Rs. 600,000, the monthly loan instalment to be paid by the student will be Rs. 8,333. After obtaining the degree, the students should repay the loan within eight years. During the 12 year period, the government will pay the interest to the bank.

JO formed following talks between President, UPFA section: Anura Kumara
The Joint Opposition(JO) in Parliament is a group that was formulated following discussions between President Mairipala Sirisena and a section of the UPFA, Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday.
He said that the Joint Opposition has nothing to do with Parliament. It should not be allowed as it would create an opportunity in future for a government to send a faction to the opposition and take over the power of the opposition too Dissanayake said. He made this observation yesterday joining the argument that flared when the JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said that the JO needed more time to speak on the resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
He said that he made this statement as the Joint Opposition made various allegations against them.
We are the real opposition. And we should get 60 percent of the speaking time as per the usual practice but that tradition was broken by former Minister Basil Rajapksa. He introduced a new tradition where the speaking time was divided by 50 percent to both the sides, MP Dissanayke said. However, we do not ask for 60 percent of the time since we are a small group.
He also said that the time the Joint Opposition is getting now is a portion of the time allocated for the government. He also invited the UPFA to sit with the opposition and said they were ready to hand over the position of opposition leader to the UPFA. He added that the Joint Opposition had not contested separately but with the UPFA at the election. The majority of the seats in the opposition have been taken by the TNA and the second highest number have been taken by the JVP. He added based on the same results the TNA was given the positions of leader of the Opposition and Chief Opposition Whip respectively.
A section of the UPFA sat with the opposition following the discussions with the President Maithripala Sirisena MP Dissanayake said. This should not be allowed as it would create an opportunity in future for a government to send a faction to the opposition and take over the power of the opposition too.
He also said that the Joint Opposition had handed over the motion to the Speaker and it has been allowed under the category of the Governments adjournment Motions.
He added that the 70 percent of the speaking time had been given to the government side. It has been divided as 40 percent to UNP and 30 percent to UPFA. The UPFA time has been divided between the Joint Opposition and the Government side members. The due time to Joint Opposition has been calculated in such a manner.

The suggestion was made while questions were put to the Additional Director of the Central Bank IT Department K.W. Alwis.
It was suggested that, when a total amount of Intra-day Liquidity Facility (ILF) outstanding due on April 1, 2016 was settled by the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PLT) on April 4, 2016, a manual intervention has released them from paying a sum of Rs.88 million.
Answering to a question by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake, Alwis said a sum of Rs.88 million was credited through an authorization issued by the Public Debt Department, signed by Deputy Governor Dr. N. Weerasinghe and Assistant Governor J. Mampitiya. DSG Gunatilake, questioning on the subject asked the witness, if such a manual intervention was ever done before to the Lanka Settlement System to which the witness answered in the negative .
Explaining on the ILF outstanding, Fernando PC said it was a costly mistake on the part of PTL not having bid under smaller portions, because of which his client was unable to pay the defaulted amount as at April 01, 2016.
Fernando PC said PTL has settled all amounts outstanding by the next working day and has also paid a penalty of 13.6 million for the delay.

New agreement on Htota port: Sri Lanka seeks better deal
Discussions are being held to reduce the 99 year lease of the Hambantota port. A new agreement will be signed within this month, MP Nalin Bandara said.
He was speaking at a press conference at Sirikotha yesterday.
Bandara said the initiative taken by the government to reduce the lease from 99 years was the reason to delay the singing of the agreement.
He said Sri Lanka will not lose control over the security of the port.
The government, ports authority, police and navy has the responsibility of the port. The presence of the Chinese at the port wont be a threat to the security. A Sri Lankan attached to the ports authority will be appointed as the Harbour Master," he said.
Bandara said no discussions were held before signing an agreement during the former regime. The government wants to increase Sri Lankas stake in the port deal.
MP Mujibur Rahman said the government is having discussions with China Merchants to reduce Chinas stake in the Hambantota port.
He said the agreement will be presented to Parliament once it is finalised.

New Inland Revenue Act: President to address concernes
IRCA up in arms against proposed legislation
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, said he would hold a meeting with all stakeholders to discuss the concerns raised on the new Inland Revenue Act , after the Sinhalese and Tamil New Year.
The Inland Revenue Commissioners Association yesterday severely criticized the proposed new Inland Revenue Act and said its enactment would make redundant at least 80 percent of the new RAMSIS system.
The President of the Inland Revenue Commissioners Association, Mahinda Gunaweera addressing the 16th Annual Meeting at Kingsbury, explained that the Revenue Administration and Management Information System (RAMSIS) system was programmed and based on the current Inland Revenue Act and any changes to the Act would make RAMSIS redundant.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and State Minister of Finance Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena were also present at the occasion.
RAMSIS was introduced in 2012 with the facilitation of the ADB to have the Singaporean Government assist the automation of the Department of Inland Revenue with the ultimate objective of integrating the automated systems of the Inland Revenue Department, Sri Lanka Customs and Ministry of Planning to optimize revenue and fiscal efficiency and accountability. Furthermore RAMSIS would also connect with 26 other government agencies in order to make it easier for tax payers to pay their taxes online and for the IRD to monitor and track tax payments. Services such as registration, returns, tax payments, appeals, collections, cancellation, directions, and clearances would go through the system which could collect over 95 percent of the total tax revenue.
The last and second phase of RAMSIS is expected to be completed by October of this year.
We are now reaping the benefits of RAMSIS. We have managed to increase revenue collection of the Economic Service Charge by 16 percent, VAT by 187 percent, NBT by 157 percent and the personal and company income tax by 113 percent, explained Gunaweera and added that to replace RAMSIS at this point would be a colossal waste of money and effort.
It will cause many unforeseen consequences, inconvenience the people and confuse tax administration, he said. The Association instead has proposed that the current Inland Revenue Act No 10 of 2006 instead be reviewed and any unnecessary tax incentives be removed in order to increase the countys tax base.
We cannot make the structural changes the IMF needs. With revisions to the existing act, we can increase our base, he said.
The government however has been put under pressure by the IMF to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act; the revision of its tax policy is one of conditions put forward by the IMF when it granted the USD 1.5 billion Extended Loan Facility to Sri Lanka in 2016. The IMF was of the opinion that, new Act should: broaden the tax base by removing excess tax incentives; modernize rules related to cross-border transactions to address base erosion and combat tax avoidance; reduce complexity through an improved principles-based drafting style; and strengthen and clarify existing powers of the Inland Revenue Department to improve enforcement.

Oxford Business  Group opens research library for Colombo University students
Students at the Colombo University were provided with access to the extensive library of economic reports on emerging markets produced by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
Under the agreement, which forms part of OBG's worldwide Academic Programme, students based at the Graduate Studies faculty headed by Dean Nayani Melegoda, and faculty of Management and Finance, run by Dean R. Senathiraja, were given read-only access to the Group's country reports, alongside over 25,000 searchable articles produced by its on-the-ground teams.
The decision to allow students to make use of OBG's content followed a meeting between OBG's team and Lakshman Dissanayake, the vice-chancellor of the Colombo University. Topics on the agenda at the talks included the challenges that providers of higher education in Sri Lanka face.
Commenting after the agreement was signed, OBG's managing editor for Asia, Paulius Kuncinas said he was confident that the reports and updates on emerging markets would prove to be a valuable tool for students during their time at the University of Colombo and beyond.
Sri Lanka is keen to broaden its range of trading partners and capitalise further on its strategic location, he said. Our business intelligence will give students and faculty here a valuable insight into the latest developments across a broad range of emerging economies as the country looks to redefine its position on the regional and global stage.
OBG's managing editor for Sri Lanka, Geoff Cooke, added that the agreement was timely, given Sri Lanka's plans to shift towards a knowledge-led economy.
The government has made clear its commitment to developing a human resource base with the skills to support an economy in which innovation and technology will galvanise new growth, he said. We look forward to supporting a national drive to put education at the forefront of change by sharing our data and analysis with students here, many of whom will be playing a key role in shaping the country's future.
OBG currently partners over 60 universities and business schools worldwide as part of its Academic Programme, providing more than 10,000 students with access to its data.
The Group is currently undertaking the research for The Report: Sri Lanka 2017, its second publication on the country's economy.
The publication will mark the culmination of more than six months of field research by a team of analysts from Oxford Business Group. It will assess trends and developments across the economy, including those in macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and others.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2017 will be available in print and online.

Debate on UN Resolution in Geneva:JO sabotaged debate fearing Govt. would place true facts before country
Justice and Buddha Sasana Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe alleged yesterday, that the representatives of a dictatorial regime that reverse the cause of democracy are still trying to sabotage the affairs of Parliament.
Addressing a media briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, he said the Joint Opposition which strategically positioned a debate requested by the government to its own advantage, had no desire what so ever to participate in this debate.
If the debate happened, the government members would have placed the true facts before the people which the JO feared, he added.
Today, the debate was about the UN resolution in Geneva and how it could affect the country. This debate was first requested by the UNP and only afterwards, the JO submitted it as their own motion. So, we also agreed to that. Due to the state funeral of Most Venerable Davuldena
Gnanissara Maha Nayaka Thera, the party leaders agreed to continue with the debate only till 3 pm. But the JO sabotaged the debate even though time had been allocated up to 3pm.The Standing Orders of Parliament, indicates how time is allocated to various political parties.
Political parties are given time without any problems. The Speaker has never denied time to any political party. We have allocated sufficient time to the UPFA.
It is an internal issue of the UPFA. If they really need to sort it out, they need to meet their party leader President Maithripala Sirisena and discuss it with him. We, the government nor the Speaker could sort out their internal party issues.
We have neither moral rights nor legal rights to involve in this issue, the Minister said.
It was none other than former President Rajapaksa who first initiated this human rights issue, not
the international community. A couple of days after the war, the then UN Secretary General Ban ki Moon arrived here. Along with him, the former President signed a document on May 23, 2009. In that document, Former President Rajapaksa stated that all accountability issues would be investigated and he would seek international support for the purpose of probing human rights violations, alleged to have taken place during the last phase of the war. It was on the basis of that document, the so-called Darusman Committee was appointed. So the blame for the origin of this issue should be placed on the Joint Oppositions doorstep. They knew we would tell this to the House in the debate and disrupted the session.
Had the previous government managed its foreign affairs better, the issue of human rights violations would not have come this far. Foreign affairs were in total shambles under the Rajapaksa regime, which appointed their family friends and relatives to the top posts of the
diplomatic and foreign service. It was not the Minister Prof Peiris who ran the ministry, but Sajin Vass Gunawardena. That government appointed Lankans holding foreign citizenships to the diplomatic posts. When a foreign national is appointed to a diplomatic post, that persons top priority would not be the interests of this country, but his obligations to the country of his citizenship or the one which has issued him with a stay permit.
We could have made use of the debate to expose the Joint Opposition who masquerades as true patriots. They knew their treachery would be exposed and disrupted the debate for their survival. What they did amounted to depriving the people of their rights and waste of public funds.
Parliament Affairs and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka also addressed the press.
To attend funeral of Ven. Mahanayaka thero:JO not opposed to cutting short sittings
The Joint Opposition does not object to the Parliamentary sittings time being cut short as a mark of respect to the most Venerable Maha Nayaka Thera of the Amarapura Chapter and enabling members take part in the funeral, said Joint Opposition member Dullas Alahapperuma.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the argument that flared up when JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said that the JO needed more time to speak on the resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma said the Joint Opposition agreed with the decision and even cancelled the special statement under Standing Order 23 (2).
"But our concern is that the Joint Opposition that moves this adjournment motion had got only one seventh of the debate time," said MP Alahapperuma.
"We have seen that when Opposition Leader R Sampanthan and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake moved the adjournment motions, they were given a considerably time. We should be given more time."
Members of the Joint Opposition were never against closing the debate early yesterday as a mark of respect to the late Mahanayaka thera.
Sri Lanka at UNHRC:JO has nothing to speak on resolution
The Joint Opposition has nothing to speak on the resolution on Sri Lanka at the UNHRC, said Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, while joining the argument that flared up when JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said that the JO needed more time to speak on resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
The Minister further said that if the JO had facts to speak about the resolution, they had to thank the government for providing the time to move the motion and commence the motion. However, Minister Karunathilake said that yesterday was a special day. "Today we hold the cremation of the Most Venerable Maha Nayaka Thera of the of the Amarapura Chapter which is to be held with State honours," Minister Karunathilake said. "We decided at the Party Leaders' meeting yesterday, to participate in it after adjourning sittings at 3 pm. So I think nobody in the House would object to it. However, Minister Karunathilake said yesterday was a special day.
JO has to solve their issues with President, not with Speaker
The Joint Opposition members have to solve their issues with their leader President Maithripala Sirisena and not with the Speaker, said Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the argument that commenced when JO member Dinesh Gunawardena said the JO needed more time to speak on the resolution when the Speaker announced to move the adjournment motion.
"As our Prime Minister always say, these problems concerning the Joint Opposition should be solved with the SLFP Leader President Maithripala Sirisena," said Minister Kiriella. "We will arrange a time for you to meet the President," he said. In response, Speaker Jayasuriya said that they would get it solved and solve the matter at hand.
JO as Oppositions Goliath should be provided with more time:Dinesh
As the Joint Opposition is Goliath on the Opposition side, so it should be given a considerable period of the debate on the adjournment motion moved by the Joint Opposition on the resolution on Sri Lanka at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, said Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena in Parliament yesterday.
He made this demand yesterday, after having flared up during an argument before moving the adjournment motion.
MP Gunawardena said they had been given only 31 minutes to speak during the debate on the the resolution on Sri Lanka at the UNHCR at Geneva. He added that the usual norm in the House is that the group which is moving a motion be given 50 percent of the total allocated time. He added earlier that the JVP and the TNA received one hour when they moved the adjournment motion. He requested that his group too be given 100 minutes. "It is only the JO who speaks of the dangers faced by the country," Dinesh Gunawardena said. "That is not fair."
Adjournment of Parliament by Speaker:We were deprived of time to defend motherland, security forces: Dullas
Joint Opposition Leader and MP Dinesh Gunawardena said in Parliament yesterday, that the Joint Opposition (JO) strongly protested against the adjournment of Parliament by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya when there was an adjournment debate on the UN Resolution on Geneava to be taken up for debate at adjournment time.
He said the JO regrets that Parliament was adjourned in this manner and points out that this was a grave situation.
MP Gunawardena made this statement addressing journalists at the reporters room of the Parliamentary complex. The JO had requested a debate on this issue for the last month. The adjournment debate requested by the JO on the UN Resolution which is a betrayal of our valiant Security Forces was a agreed upon at the party leaders meeting. However, we came to know this morning that our four speakers had been allocated only 32 minutes. But it could have taken at least 15 minutes to read the adjournment motion and another 15 minutes to explain it. Then afterwards, there would have been no time left for anyone else to speak.
The Speaker was willing to consider giving more time for the speakers of the JO this morning. But the Leader of the House rejected this request during Parliament sessions. JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake had also wasted 15 minutes speaking on an entire different subject.
Later, the Speaker adjourned Parliament. Only we are speaking against this injustice done to Sri Lanka by the UNHRC. But, we were deprived of the time allocated to defend the motherland and heroic security forces.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma said it was very clear that the government was not ready for the debate, since there were only two Cabinet Ministers in the chamber since morning.
UPFA MPs sitting on both sides of the House:Matter should be solved by discussion
The issue concerning a section of the UPFA sitting on one side with the Opposition, while the rest are sitting with the government, should be finalised soon, observed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya in Parliament yesterday.
He said that he had nothing to do with the allocation of time for speaking in Parliament, while it was a matter between the government and the opposition.
The Speaker also observed that he was obsessed with the issues brought before him between these two factions. "This issue should be solved after the matter had been discussed with the party leaders, the UPFA, the President and the Prime Minister as well," the Speaker said.
Due to arguments, Parliament sittings lasted for only 55 minutes
Parliament sittings lasted only for 55 minutes yesterday, since the argument over the allotted time for the Joint Opposition did not come to and end as the Joint Opposition went on saying they needed more time.
Parliament which was scheduled to adjourn at 11.30 am and to take up the adjournment motion by the Joint Opposition on the Geneva Resolution. It was to be moved by the Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. The Parliamentary Business Committee had decided to end the adjournment motion at 3 pm as a mark of respect to late Maha Nayaka Thera of Amarapura Chapter Most Ven Davuldena Sri Gnanissara Thera, as the cremation was scheduled to be held last evening. The Business Committee also had decided to continue with the debate without a lunch break. The Opposition members had also agreed not to move the statements under Standing Orders 23 (2) to allocate more time for the debate.
Parliament sittings which commenced presided by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at 10.30 am, adjourned at 10.58 am after the presentation of papers and oral questions. Thereafter, the Speaker announced the adjournment motion be moved. MP Dinesh Gunawardena pointed out that the allotted time for the Joint Opposition was 32 minutes. "The total time allotted for the adjournment motion was 210 minutes. However the allotted time for the Joint Opposition was 32 minutes," pointed out Dinesh Gunawardena. "We need at least 100 minutes."
Speaker Jayasuriya observed that he was ready to grant another thirty minutes which was left by some of the non attendant members. However, the argument between the members of the government side and opposition lasted for another thirty minutes without a change. Leader of the House stated that as the Joint Opposition was reluctant to move the motion proposal to adjourn the sittings until today.
"If you don't move the motion, I would have to adjourn the sittings," the Speaker said. "By now the argument had consumed 28 minutes".
When MP Dinesh Gunawardena said that the JO needed a decision, the Speaker adjourned the sittings until 10 am today.

Porsche introduces new Sport Turismo
Porsche is expanding the Panamera family with the addition of a new body version, the Panamera Sport Turismo which celebrated its world premire at the Geneva Motor Show recently.
Based on the successful sports saloon, the new version once again makes a profound statement in the luxury segment with its unmistakable design.
The Sport Turismo, with up to 404 kW/550 hp, is more versatile than any other model in its class. With a large tailgate, low loading edge, increased luggage compartment volume and a 4+1 seating concept, the new Panamera model offers the perfect combination of everyday usability and maximum flexibility. The Panamera Sport Turismo is a step forward into a new segment, but retains all of the values and attributes that are characteristics of Porsche.
The Sport Turismo utilises all the innovations introduced with the brand new Panamera model line launched only last year. These include the digital Porsche Advanced Cockpit, pioneering assistance systems such as Porsche InnoDrive, including adaptive cruise control, chassis systems such as rear axle steering, the Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC Sport) electronic roll stabilisation system and powerful powertrains. In addition, all Panamera Sport Turismo vehicles are equipped with Porsche Traction Management (PTM)  an active all-wheel drive system with electronically controlled multi-plate clutch  as standard. As of the S models, adaptive air suspension with three-chamber technology is also supplied as standard.
The Porsche Panamera family includes different versions of the model such as the Panamera 4, Panamera 4S, Panamera 4S Diesel, Panamera 4 E-Hybrid and Panamera Turbo.
First adaptively extendible roof spoiler in the segment
At the top of the vehicle, the roof extends into an adaptive spoiler.
The angle of the roof spoiler is set in three stages depending on the driving situation and selected vehicle settings, and generates an additional downforce of up to 50 kg on the rear axle.Up to a speed of 170 km/h, the aerodynamic guide element  a central system component of the Porsche Active Aerodynamics (PAA)  stays in its retracted position with an angle of minus seven degrees, which reduces drag and thus optimises fuel consumption.

Saudi Fund for Development, Sri Lanka sign 2 loan agreements

The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) signed two loan agreements with Sri Lanka to assist the island nation in two projects the Arab News reported.
SFD Adviser Abdullah Al-Shedokhi and R.H.S Samaratunga, secretary to the treasury of Sri Lanka, signed the SR263 million agreement for the Mahaweli Left Bank Basin Development and the Wayamba University/Township Development Project.
Mahaweli Left Bank Lower Basin Development Project is a proposal made by Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa, minister of irrigation and water resources management, at an estimated cost of $430 million, with the objective of providing irrigated water during two seasons for 4,000 acres of land to include Kinniya and Kantale Trincomalee and the Polonnaruwa districts.
Wayamba University of Sri Lanka (WUSL), which is located at Kuliyapitya and Makandura with easy access from Colombo, Kurunegala, and Kandy, is a modern learning and research institution in Sri Lanka.
According to Sri Lankan Ambassador Azmi Thassim, the SFD has been instrumental in financing several projects in the island.
The construction of a bridge, which links the Eastern town of Trincomalee with Kinniya, a Muslim village, is beneficial to 100,000 people living in Kinniya.
The residents were using ferry as their mode of transport to come to Trincomalee, the north-eastern capital of the island. The Trincomalee-Batticaloa highway was also widened with the same funds allocated under the agreement.
Earlier, Sri Lanka government signed two loan agreements with SFD to obtain partial financing for the $140 million rehabilitation of the A5 Road corridor from Badulla to Chenkaladi.
The A5 corridor is one of the major highways linking parts of the Central Province to Eastern Province geopolitical zones of the country, which carries the bulk of the traffic between Batticaloa and Peradeniya via Badulla.
Improvements to A5 road corridor from Badulla to Chenkaladi would enhance access to markets and social infrastructure such as schools and hospitals and integrate isolated segments of the rural population into the overall economy, the Finance Ministry said in a short statement on Friday.

Syria war: US launches missile strikes in response to chemical 'attack'

The US has carried out a missile attack against an air base in Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack on a rebel-held town.
The Pentagon said 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired at 04:40 Syrian time (01:40 GMT) from destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean.
In a televised address, President Donald Trump said the base was the launch point for the chemical attack.
He called on "all civilised nations" to help end the conflict in Syria.
Dozens of civilians, including many children,died in the suspected nerve gas attackon Tuesday in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province.
Speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump branded Syrian President Bashar al-Assad a "dictator" who had "launched a horrible chemical weapons attack on innocent civilians".
Trump said he had acted in America's "vital national security interest" to prevent the use of chemical weapons.
"Tonight I call on all civilised nations to join us in seeking to end this slaughter and bloodshed in Syria and also to end terrorism of all kinds and all types," he said.
The Pentagon said the Russian military, which is supporting the Syrian government, had been informed ahead of the US attack.
In a statement it said missiles fired from Navy destroyers USS Porter and USS Ross had targeted aircraft, aircraft shelters, storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers, air defence systems, and radars at the Shayrat airfield.
The Pentagon added that the strike was intended "to deter the regime from using chemical weapons again".
Rarely has a policy changed so far and so quickly - and rarely has it been acted upon so swiftly.
When President Trump came to office the Syrian leader was seen as a useful ally in the fight against so-called Islamic State. All talk of regime change stopped.
But the chemical weapons attack changed all that. Within two days, the US has reversed its view on President Assad, identified targets and struck.
What we don't know is whether this is a one-off act of retaliation, or the start of something more prolonged against the Assad government. Nor do we know where it leaves relations with Syria's strong ally, Russia.
A White House spokesman said the site targeted by the cruise missiles "was directly linked to the horrific chemical weapons attack".
"We assess with a high degree of confidence that the chemical weapons attack earlier this week was launched from this site by air assets under the command of the Assad regime," the official said.
"We also assess, with a similar degree of confidence, that the Assad regime used a chemical nerve agent consistent with Sarin in these attacks."
A statement on Syrian state TV said "American aggression" had targeted a Syrian military base with "a number of missiles" but gave no further details.
The US action was welcomed by Syrian opposition group the Syrian National Coalition.
"We hope for more strikes... that these are just the beginning," spokesman Ahmad Ramadan told AFP news agency. "
President Trump had earlier warned that "something should happen" against the Syrian leadership following the deaths in Khan Sheikhoun, but gave no details.
Also on Thursday, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signalled a sudden shift in policy by the Trump administration, saying that Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria.
Only last week the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Washington was no longer prioritising the removal of the Syrian president.
The UN Security Council will hold further talks on Friday as it tries to agree a resolution calling for an investigation into the deaths in Khan Sheikhoun.
Russia has already rejected a Western-backed draft. Moscow has used its veto seven times to block UN resolutions critical of its ally Syria.

Trump welcomes 'friend' China's Xi for talks

US President Donald Trump has welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Florida resort for their first summit.
Trump said the two men had "developed a friendship" as they sat for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago retreat.
The American leader is expected to press his counterpart for action on North Korea, and Xi to seek assurances on Taiwan.
Trump has said the summit "will be a very difficult one". Last year he accused China of "raping the US".
During the election campaign, he said massive trade deficits and job losses could no longer be tolerated.
But at dinner on Thursday, it was all smiles, with the leaders' two wives, folk singer Peng Liyuan and First Lady Melania Trump also in attendance.
The visit will conclude with a working lunch on Friday.
But there is unlikely to be any golf. While Trump is fond of hitting the fairway, Xi's administration has cracked down on the sport in an anti-corruption drive.
All eyes will be on body language between the two leaders - one a softly spoken Communist Party apparatchik and the other a brash Manhattan property tycoon.
BBC China Editor Carrie Gracie says observers can expect an unpredictable power play from the very first handshake.
The Chinese are reportedly wary that the mercurial US president could embarrass Xi, who faces a party congress in November, by some breach of protocol.
The Republican president's blue-collar supporters will hope he can translate his China-bashing election rhetoric into concrete gains for American manufacturing workers.
Some protesters lined the streets on Thursday to voice their opposition to China's policy in the South China Sea.
Despite his tough campaign talk, Trump has so far not followed through on his threat to formally brand China a "currency manipulator", or to hit Chinese imports with punitive tariffs.
One of the most urgent issues for the US is nuclear-armed North Korea, which fired a missile into the Sea of Japan on Wednesday.
Pyongyang is trying to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the west coast of the US.
Trump is expected to call on Xi to arm-twist North Korea into halting its nuclear programme by denying it access to banking institutions.
The US president told the Financial Times this week he was prepared to act unilaterally.
"If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will," he said.
A senior White House official said Pyongyang would be a key test for the Trump-Xi relationship.
"The clock is very, very quickly running out," the official said. "All options are on the table for us."
Although Beijing has condemned the missile tests, it has been reluctant to isolate its neighbour, fearing its collapse could spawn a refugee crisis and leave the American military camped on its doorstep.
For his part, Xi will seek assurances from Trump on US arms sales to Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province that must reunify with the mainland.
Trump outraged the Chinese in December when he took the unorthodox step of accepting a phone call from the Taiwanese president.
But the US president agreed to respect the "one China" policy in a telephone call with President Xi in February.
Climate change, which Trump once dismissed as a Chinese hoax, and Beijing's building of artificial islands in the disputed South China Sea, could also come up.

UNP MP condemns GMOA strike
UNP MP Mujibur Rahman condemned the GMOA strike and added that the poor patients are the worst affected by these strikes. He was speaking at a press conference held at Sirikotha yesterday. MP Rahman said that the GMOA was practicing double standards. Some interested parties with personal or political agendas are carrying these out. They do not speak about the standards of the KDU medical college or the private hospitals and how they function,he said. He said it is the responsibility of the government to provide standard education.
If there are any issues with the standard of education at SAITM, GMOA can propose measures to solve it. Launching strikes whilst causing trouble for patients and public is not the solution. They are trying to fulfill their agendas by threatening the government, he said.
MP Rahman speaking about the May Day Celebrations said Joint Opposition has been given the Galle Face grounds to hold the event and now they cannot blame the government. Their statement to bring 20 lakhs of people for the May Day celebration is not practically possible, he said.

UNP stresses need for one voice on crucial matters
Wijeyadasas statement on Htota Port Deal criticized by WC members:
Ministers asked to inform PM before leaving for foreign trips:
The UNP Working Committee members yesterday stressed that the members of the national unity government should have one voice on crucial economic and political matters.
Strongly criticising Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshes recent statement in Parliament over the Hambantota Port deal with China, the UNP Working Committee members said such statements were detrimental to the government and its economic development agenda.
UNP General Secretary Minister Kabir Hashim, Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasighe and MP Lakshman Wijemanna directed their criticism at the Justice Ministers statement on the Hambanthota Port agreement, saying the members of the government should act in a responsible manner, when voicing their views on the governments decisions.
Minister Samaraweera, in a strong statement before the UNP Working Committee, said the government should make the right decisions without pandering to elements attempting to derail the ruling alliances economic reforms process.
He had pointed out that, when Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) employees protested and threatened to die on the streets, the government went ahead with its decision and today the SLT has become a profit-making entity.
Minister had emphasized that the decision on the Hambantota port should be taken in a manner that would benefit the country, in the long run.
Meanwhile, State Minister of International Trade Sujeewa Senasighe said no decision was taken to change key posts in the party at the UNP working committee meeting yesterday.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the decisions will be taken only after the May Day, Minister Senasinghe said yesterday at the Cabinet briefing.
He said that changes are expected after May Day and added that it would happen when the party is being restructured.
Meanwhile, Deputy Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare Ranjan Ramanayake told the Daily News that the foreign tours of Cabinet ministers and ruling party MPs were also discussed at the meeting.
It was decided at the meeting that the ministers and MPs should inform the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe before making any foreign visits,Ramanayake said.
