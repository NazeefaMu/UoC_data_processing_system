Countrys revenue should  increase to 16.5% of GDP
Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Indrajit Coomaraswamy said that the country was practicing exactly the opposite to which other countries were doing in terms of macroeconomic policies.
SMEs need to be linked up to a stable market base in order to reduce the financial problems.
Gracing the Experience Sharing Forum on local economic development in practice organized by the Industrial Services Bureau (ISB), he said that been second only to Japan at the time of independence on any social economic indicators, Sri Lanka had reduced its standings at a considerable state.
Difficulty in managing the performance of the budget and unsustainable development had paved the way for this.
There are three key challenges faced in terms of macroeconomic policy making: government revenue policy making as a percentage to GDP, concessional and non concessional debt as a percentage to foreign debt and merchandise export as a percentage of GDP. he said.
Accordingly the revenue needs to be increased in order to get out of the budget deficit problem. The current revenue of the country is 13.8% to GDP which should be increased up to 16.5%. The current expenditure rate is 20% GDP.
In 2006 we had a non concessional debt percentage of 7.3 which increased to 54.8 by now. After been relieved from the low income state in 2007, the country had to rely on non concessional debts. Using these grants in projects which had given lesser returns in recent times had resulted in this situation. Hence we should concentrate more on obtaining greater return for our borrowing.
Accounting for the recent statistics, merchandise exports have faced tremendous decrease of 13% in 2017 with comparison to year 2000. Unavailability of strategies to diversify the export products and not been able to make our products more complex has led to this situation.
Only 7% of our exports are part of the regional or global export chain due to exchange rate been uncompetitive and the high import rates, he further added.

Female participation low in decision-making roles
The unsung heroes of the Sri Lanka Army, the Womens Corps (SLAWC), which has rendered an immense service to the nation with little recognition, will take the lead in creating a forum for women to discuss womens contributions to the country under the theme Women: the Bedrock of Peace and Sustainable Development, scheduled to take place at the BMICH on December 4.
This was revealed at a media briefing held at the Colombo Hilton Residences on Tuesday.
With the majority of the countrys population consisting of women, it is inevitable that women will take the lead in all forms of development in future. This symposium will also serve as a platform for learning and interacting as womens participation in leading decision-making roles since they are also still underrepresented in society. The first ever symposium of this nature organised by the SLAWC will be held under various appropriate topics.
Addressing the media, Dr. Dayani Panagoda said that since the forming of the Womens Corps in 1979, till 2009 it had served as a support service during the war.
What we expect to achieve through this conference is to create a broader engagement with various segments of society in terms of womens participation. Although women are engaged in many areas, when it comes to decision-making roles, female participation is at a low level. This forum would serve to encourage women to forge ahead in their chosen fields and take on a greater role in society.
Professor Jeewa Niriella said womens participation in Sri Lanka is on par with the rest of the world, but when it comes to taking on leadership, Sri Lanka is at a lower level.
In roles of administration, female participation gradually decreases, and we need to see why this happens. This sort of forum will give women the opportunity to see why they are less engaged in decision-making roles and take appropriate measures to increase it, she said.
She added that a woman receives ample experience while playing many roles within her family, which is helpful to her in handling any position in society.
Director General Training Major General Aruna Wanniarachchi, Sri Lanka Army Womens Corps Regiment Colonel Major General Manoj Mudannayake, Colombo University Public and International Law Department Head Prof. Jeewa Niriella, Independent Consultant/Attorney-at-Law/Partner Associated Law Chambers Dr. Dayani Panagoda, SLAWC Additional Regimental Centre General Staff Officer 1 Major Nayomi Rathnayake, and SLAWC Legal Officer Colonel Buddhika Ferdinandez attended the media briefing.

Soft power in cyberspace, critical in modern warfare
The International Cyber Security Symposium Wave and the ICT Exhibition organised by the Army Signal Corps to coincide with its 75th anniversary, commenced at the BMICH yesterday.
President Maithripala Sirisena graced the occasion as the chief guest at the invitation of the Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
The Symposium comprised of ICT experts from more than 10 countries, including India, China, UK, Pakistan, Singapore, Bangladesh, etc. and representatives of ICT-related industries.
President Maithripala Sirisena, flanked by the Secretary Defence, Secretary to Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, Tri-service Commanders, the Inspector General of Police, the SLSC Colonel Commandant and other distinguished invitees including foreign representatives, lit the traditional oil lamp.
In his opening remarks, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake highlighted the significance of understanding the challenges of cyberspace.
Soft power in cyberspace can play a vital and decisive role in modern-day battlefields. In other words, when battlefields become automated; when weapons systems are becoming more remotely-controlled, when communication systems combined with data transmissions become network-centric, and when soldiers in the battlefield are equipped and fed from automated information systems of video, voice and data; we must not forget that all such systems are highly vulnerable to cyber threats, the Army commander said.
Therefore, future battlefields are essentially required to operate in cyber environments, both offensive and defensive in nature. In this context, as the Commander of the Army, I believe that operating in cyber environments is an essential capability that the Sri Lanka Army should possess. Today, we have a Cyber Security Regiment in the Army, he said.
He added that the army needed to explore the cyber domain and develop capabilities, mainly in the defensive sub-domain. Then it will further strengthen the Armys endeavour to become a capacity-based sustainable Army, he said, Therefore, I believe that this initiative by the Sri Lanka Signal Corps, to conduct a cybersecurity symposium, match the vision of the Army.
Also addressing the gathering, keynote speaker Secretary Defence Hemasiri Fernando said that cyberspace activities would cripple the human race and stop almost everything in the world due to the its connectivity. Youths are frequently drawn to the internet, he said, adding that cyberspace was also used for money-laundering and other cyber-crimes.
At the stroke of a button, you can cause a massive calamity and jeopardise national security. We need to look at it as a threat to human existence itself. We saw how the US gave prime priority to cyberspace threats, and we also knew how it worked during their elections, as they alleged. Considering what is going on, a cyber-war is inevitable and it is the result of this wide connectivity. Things would worsen unless due attention is paid and the expansion is carefully examined and halted on time, Fernando added.
The three symposium sessions were held under an array of topics concerting cyber space and security related issues. These sessions were chaired by Chief Army Signal Officer Major General N.M. Hettiarachchi, British Army Chief Information Officer Major General Jon Cole and CICRA Holdings Group Director/Chief Executive Officer Boshan Dayaratna.
A panel of local and foreign experts delivered lectures during the symposium sessions. The exhibition, with more than 160 stalls, will be open to the public until tomorrow.

He said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya must be day dreaming in trying to become the next Prime Minister and this dream has led him to lose his independence in Parliament.
We cannot accept him as the Speaker of Sri LankaS Parliament due to his partial and biased conduct. The political meetings that should be held at Sirikotha are now being held in Parliament and There is no point in attending Sirikotha meetings in Parliament, Weerawansa said

Archbishop calls for ex-communication of drug traffickers
Even death as a punishment could be justified for drug traffickers as their crimes are such that they in fact amount to killing of innocent youth who become addicts, said Archbishop of Colombo, Malcolm, Cardinal Ranjith.
The Cardinal was speaking at a mammoth prayer rally at St Marys Church, Tudella, on Sunday, to seek divine intervention against the drug menace.
The faithful from 10 parishes belonging to the Tudella diocese arrived in procession to the Tudella Church, for the prayer rally.
Cardinal Ranjith referred to the Holy Scripture and said Jesus Christ has said, But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea, (Mathew 18.6).
He said that if people amass wealth by indulging in activities like drug trafficking that kill children and youth, punishment that justifies their crime should be meted out to them.
He called upon the 10 parish priests who led processions from their churches to identify the drug traffickers, big and small, whether politically backed or with other influence, and if they belonged to the congregation of the church, to ex-communicate them.
Cardinal Ranjith instructed the parish priests, that the identified drug traffickers should not be given Holy Communion, as they have to be classed as criminals.
These drugs are smuggled into the country and systematically distributed among the youth. Black money so earned would not last long and those who indulge in such activities have to account for them to God, he said.
If someone earns through others pain and suffering, they would have to pay it back very dearly as those crimes would cause Gods wrath, the Archbishop said.
Cardinal Ranjith said that the areas of Ja-Ela, Gampaha and Negombo are notorious for drug trafficking. So, if any Christian is involved in the notorious business, they are not Christians or Catholics. He urged those who are concerned about others lives to team up with the priests to apprehend such criminals who distribute drugs and bring them under the law.

Bangladesh GDP can witness 10% growth  exploring blue economy
Experts have called for accelerated moves for exploring blue economy saying it could reach the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to a staggering 10% growth in one decade with Bangladeshs now expanded maritime boundary.
If we can properly tap the potentials of blue-economy, then we will be able to raise the GDP growth to 10% in the next one decade, Prof Mustafizur Rahman, honorary fellow of Centre for Policy Dialogue, told the BSS.
He also cited bright prospect in Bangladeshs marine-resources based blue economy following the settlement of maritime boundary disputes with neighbouring Myanmar and India. We need to properly extract marine resources, protect these resources and thus utilize those in a sustainable manner, Dr Mustafizur said, adding that the marine resources feature different mineral resources including oil and gas alongside fisheries and aquatic resources.
Last year, the government formed the Blue Economy Cell to ensure proper exploration of marine resources besides ensuring proper coordination in this sector. Additional Secretary Golam Shafiuddin, who is also in charge of this cell, told the BSS that this Blue Economy Cell has been coordinating the activities of 17 ministries and divisions concerned.
The meeting of this cell is held in every two months. He said around 5% of GDP needs to be added from the sea and marine resources to the national economy to become a developed economy. The future of marine-based economy has a bright potential and the government is very much sincere in this regard, Shafiuddin added.
Talking to the national news agency, chairman of Department of Oceanography of the University of Dhaka Professor Dr Kawser Ahmed said The Territorial Water and Maritime Zones Act was first enacted in 1974 during the tenure of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. He said not only in Bangladesh, but many countries in the world were also not aware of such thing.
But, Father of the Nation had such farsightedness that he had then enacted the maritime boundary related act to ensure the rights of Bangladesh in the Bay of Bengal. Prof Kawser also echoed with the Blue Economy Cell chief saying that Bangladesh needs to add around 5% of GDP from the Blue-Economy to the national economy to attain the SDGs.

CIPM Sri Lanka to Play Key Role  in Regional APFHRM initiatives
CIPM Sri Lanka, the Nations leader in human resource management under the stewardship of its President Dhammika Fernando will play a key role in several important initiatives of the regional HR body Asia Pacific Federation for Human Resource Management (APFHRM).
Amongst these initiatives, CIPM Sri Lankas proposal for establishing an Asia Pacific Center for Excellence in Human Resource Management in Sri Lanka and the hosting of the World Congress 2020 Sri Lanka HR Conference were of particular significance.
These and other initiatives were discussed at the APFHRM Board Meeting, in which CIPM Sri Lanka President participated as the Board Member, held recently at the Westin Hotel in Pune, India along the sidelines of the NATCON India 2018 organized by the National Institute of Personnel Management (NIPM) India.
As the only recognized professional body for human resource management in Sri Lanka which is gaining regional recognition for many of the groundbreaking initiatives to uplift the profession and to build capacity, CIPM Sri Lanka plays a major role in helping formulate the policy framework, said Dhammika Fernando, President, CIPM Sri Lanka.
Establishing of the Asia Pacific Center of Excellence in HRM in Colombo would add a significant boost to the Nation among the Regional partners which has recognized the utmost importance of building up human capital in its journey towards development.
The Center of Excellence will also encourage Applied Research in HRM and studies into immerging trends in the field which will no doubt boost the opportunities while opening new vistas for the profession as a science. This discussion paper proposed by the President to the regional body is an initiative of one of CIPM Past President Jayantha Jayaratna, which will be discussed in detail by the Board when they meet in Fiji.
CIPM Sri Lanka has been awarded the honor of hosting the worlds largest HR conclave The World HR Congress 2020 in Sri Lanka in the year 2020. This prestigious People Management conference is held every 2 years in different regions of the world under the auspices of The World Federation of People Management Associations (WFPMA) which is headquartered in Virginia, USA. The World Congress enables HR professionals to build a global community of peers, to discuss new developments in HRM, and to network with colleagues from around the world who face similar complex challenges in human resource management.
It is Sri Lankas honor and CIPM Sri Lankas prestige to host the World Congress 2020 in Sri Lanka. We discussed our proposed action plan running up to the World Congress 2020 at the APFHRM Board Meeting. It was decided that a planning committee be established under APFHRM to support CIPM Sri Lanka in its efforts, he added.
Some of the other initiatives that were discussed at the APFHRM Board Meeting included the setting up and transferring of the APFHRM website to be managed by CIPM Sri Lanka and Sri Lankas recommendation to induct the newly formed Maldivian HR fraternity MAHRP - Maldivian Association of Human Resource Professionals as a full member , an effort which was spearheaded by the President of CIPM last year in his capacity as the External Affairs Committee Chairman of CIPM.

Conference renews call for rainwater harvesting
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday stressed the importance of providing sustainable water and sanitation services for growing cities to limit adverse health and development impacts.
Water and sanitation are two main challenges of sustaining human urban settlements and without reliable access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation, cities cannot be sustainable, he said.
Minister Gunawardena said policymakers and national planners should take these issues into serious consideration and new sources of water and energy including rainwater harvesting, solar power and wind power should be incorporated in their future development plans.
The Minister was speaking at the inauguration of the International Conference on Water Security through Rainwater Harvesting organised by the Lanka Rainwater Harvesting Forum in collaboration with the City Planning and Water Supply Ministry, International Water Management Institute (IWMI) with the support of USAID, and other sponsors.
The Minister charged that the Port City development project has completely ignored rainwater collection. Therefore, we will have to put some pressure on decision-makers, he said.
Speaking on the occasion, City Planning and Water Supply Minister Dr. M.L.A.M. Hisbullah said Sri Lanka gets an annual average rainfall of 2,000mm, ranging from 900mm to 6,000mm in different regions. However, on average only about 60 percent of this water is being used and the balance drains into the sea as run-off.
The Minister said rainwater harvesting saves water which otherwise ends up in the sea. It is also a cost-saving measure, as water in urban areas has to be paid for. It will also reduce flooding.
He further said that rainwater harvesting promotes self-sufficiency and fosters an appreciation for water as a resource. It also promotes water conservation and groundwater recharging. Rainwater harvesting also conserves energy as the energy input needed to operate a centralised water system is bypassed.
At present, we are pumping water from a long distance away in Ambatale. This is costly and much water is lost from leakages. Both energy and water can be saved if at least portion of the water needs in a household is collected through rainwater harvesting at ones own premises, the Minister said.
Local erosion and flooding in urban areas during heavy rains is lessened as a portion of local rainfall is diverted into collection tanks, he said.
IWMI Head of Sri Lanka Development Initiative Herath Manthrithilaka, City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary D.G.M.V. Hapuarachchi and other local and foreign participants also spoke on the occasion.

ARFRO Masterminds Competition - 2018 will be held on December 1 at Golden Rose, Boralesgamuwa with the participation of Officers from the Army, Navy and Air Force.
The competition will be held with the aim of creating different learning opportunities for members of the Armed Forces while focusing on improving their reading skills and knowledge of important subjects, such as military history, current affairs, general knowledge, sport and science.
The competition is organised by the Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers (ARFRO).
ARFRO is an organisation of senior retired military officers, Brigadiers, etc who are collectively referred to as Flag Rank Officers.
ARFRO came into being in 1996 as a result of an invitation from the Worldwide Consultative Association of Retired Generals and Admirals (WACARGA) to participate in their activities.
ARFRO President Rear Admiral Sarath Rathnakeerthi said the objectives of ARFRO Masterminds Competition (ARFROMC) are to arrange a platform for the members of Armed Forces to test and add value to their knowledge and providing an opportunity to showcase the knowledge of members of the Armed Forces and disseminate their knowledge among other members. It is also aimed at creating a quizzing culture among the members of Armed Forces, and launching an event that can be added as an icon to the annual calendar of events of ARFRO in the future. He said ARFRO has plans to conduct similar competitions for other categories as well such as Higher Management Category (Lieutenant Colonels, Colonels and Brigadiers of Army and equivalents in Navy and Air Force) and Lower Management Category (Lieutenants and Second Lieutenants in the Army and equivalents in Navy and Air Force). Modus operandi for ARFROMCs in Masterminds Competitions will also be the same irrespective of category of participation.
ARFROMC is not only for officers. We will have one arranged for non  commissioned officers/other ranks of three forces, conducted in a similar manner.
ARFRO has made this arrangement to create a platform for a large number of serving members of Armed Forces, who are in different levels of management hierarchy, to participate in this type of programmes.
Major General (Dr) Dudley Perera of ARFRO is expected to Chair the Panel of Judges of the ARFRO Masterminds Competition - 2018 and already, nearly 300 participants, from Army, Navy and Air Force, have registered for the competition.

Everything you need to know when obtaining a Patent
In the rapidly developing world, inventions are like mushrooms blooming overnight in the fields of science and technology. An invention is a practical solution to a problem on the field of technology and it could be in form of a process or a product. Hence, without doubt, it is important that the inventor has his rights in relation to his invention are protected from the competitors. So, it is very useful to learn the importance of a patent.
A Patent is a license issued by the State to an inventor. Under a patent, the State secures the right to exclude others from making, using and selling the invention of an inventor for a period of 20 years from the date of application for the patent. The main purpose of a patent is to protect and safeguard the inventors and the benefits resulting from the inventions thereby providing incentives encouraging further inventions and promoting investments.
Next, let us look at what can be patented. An invention that is new, industrially applicable and involves an innovative step can be patented. Moreover, a patent may be granted by the State to an improvement of a valid patented invention. But, at this step, is advisable to negotiate with the holder of the first patent prior to use as there lays a possibility of a violation of a rights of the owner of the first patent when obtaining a patent for an improvement.
How can an inventor obtain a patent When answering this question, it is important to bear in mind that a patent can be obtained locally and internationally. Looking at the procedure to obtain a local patent, the first step is to file an application at the Intellectual Property Office using the prescribed form P1. This application is a simple application that requires details such as the title of the inventions, information of the inventor, the fee paid and etc. Thereafter, a document should be submitted with the application which describes the invention clearly and completely along with the claims and the prescribed fee. Next, a search report prepared by an International Searching Authority or alternatively the applicant may request the IP Office to refer the application to a local examiner for a search report. After this step, the IP Office will examine the application as to the requirements of the IP Act. If the formal requirements are fulfilled along with a search report, the patent will be issued.
Moving on to the protecting inventions abroad, it should be highlighted that a patent is valid only in the country where it is granted. But, as Sri Lanka is a member State to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, our citizens can obtain patents for their inventions in any member country to the Paris Convention. But this will be obtained under the national law of that particular country. An applicant can claim priority under this Convention for the protection of Industrial Property in its member countries which means that claiming the effect of initial filing date in subsequent filing in other member states.
Moreover, all Sri Lankan nationals or residents can apply under the Patent Cooperation Treaty governed by the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva. This application is known as the PCT Application and it has the same effect as a national application filed in the designated countries.
A patent is valid for 20 years from the date of filing. The patent must be renewed annually from the expiration of the second year from the date of grant by paying a fee.
While new inventions can be patented, things such as discoveries, scientific methods and mathematical methods, plants, animals, microorganisms other than transgenic micro microorganisms and an essentially biological process for the production of plants and animals other than non- biological and micro- biological processes, schemes, rules or methods for doing business, performing purely mental acts or playing games, methods for treatment of human body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practiced on human or animal body and inventions which are necessary to protect public order, morality including human animal or plant life, health, or to avoid serious prejudice to environment are not patent-able.
Patents secure the rights of an inventor and help him/her to establish a monopoly in the field. It also contributes to the economy of a country by encouraging investments and for the development of technological developments. Therefore, it is justifiable to state that it is the prime duty of the inventor to secure the rights of his invention by way of a patent. So, it is advisable to apply for the issuance of a patent for your invention as soon as possible bearing.

Great opportunities for retail sector in 2019
Sri Lanka will have a very bright 2019 though the end of 2018 has been unsteady, said Ranjit Page, Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Cargills (Ceylon) Plc.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka Retailers Association (SLRA) AGM at Ramada Colombo. Year 2019 would have tremendous opportunities for the retail sector and I am very excited looking forward to it.
The Lonely Planet recognizing Sri Lanka as the best tourism destination to travel in 2019 will create huge opportunities for Sri Lanka and it will give a big boost to the retail sector.
New hotels, large malls and entertainment venues with top international brand names are opening in Sri Lanka and the retail sector should be ready.
Tourists travelling to Sri Lanka too will take back memories with them and here too Sri Lankan brands can impress.
He predicted that the future of Sri Lanka would be driven by the service sector.
Business should be ready to change and adapt to new demands and the 100 year old Cargills story and how it helped Sri Lanka to move to the super market shopping concept is one example to this.
Youth working in the Sri Lanka retail sector should be considered professionals and not treated as common labours, he said. To reach this goal staff should be more educated and an academy similar to the hotels school should be created.
The staff should be properly trained and more dignity should be given to the profession, he said. In this aspect retail sector has failed.
Chairman elect of SLRA Sidath Kodikara said, Today organized retail trade contributes to one third of the National GDP while accounting for 14% of the labour market. Retail attracts over 250 million footfalls in Sri Lanka which exemplifies the potential of physical retailing while the number of clicks for online-retail is estimated to be slightly under 2% and growing at the rate of 200% annually.
As an industry retail is capable of building value chains that bridge social inequalities while creating access to quality living across Sri Lanka through the standards set. Soon we will gain more recognition to the SLRA through an Act in Parliament.
The SLRA would also look at improving services of the SME retailers and would also fool at improving on food waste among all retailers.
Past President, Hussain Sadiq said today even the small time shop owner has improved on their displays and service levels too are increasing.
SLRAs purpose is to provide a forum where retailers can work together to improve standards of retailing in an inclusive manner, improve consumer experience and service in all facets of retailing.
The Sri Lanka Retailers Association was established in 2015 with the objective of harnessing the resources of the organized retail industry.

IIHS hosts 14th BioInquirer Annual Academic Sessions
A pioneering Sri Lankan education institute with 16 years in the field, the International Institute of Health Science (IIHS) recently hosted the 14th BioInquirer Annual Academic Sessions and Workshop on November 17 and 18, 2018.
The BioInquirer forum is a global incubator that arms professionals with knowledge and promotes growth. IIHS typically hosts two BioInquirer forums each year wherein participating professionals are motivated to present their work at a competitive level, with each conference aiming to transform attendees from task-oriented individuals to critical thinkers.
Frequently, evidence-based research generated at virtually every BioInquirer forum has a profound effect on future generations of professionals and academics. In fact, all research topics at this forum surrounds the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely SDG 3 (Good Health), SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for Goals).
The theme for 2018s BioInquirer Annual Academic Sessions was New Dimension in Health: Creating a Sustainable Healthcare Safety Net for All.
In this case, the Healthcare Safety Net (HSN) has been defined as utilizing a provider network that organizes and delivers a significant level of healthcare and other related services to uninsured, under-insured and other vulnerable populations irrespective of their financial circumstances, insurance status or health condition.
Ultimately, HSNs must become sustainable to achieve high-quality delivery of care, so public health can be improved without exhausting natural resources or causing severe ecological damage.
The keynote speaker for the 14th BioInquirer Annual Academic Sessions and Workshop was Dr. Sarath Samarage, Senior Fellow at Institute for Health Policy Sri Lanka, who commented on the measures to be taken to ensure a sustainable Health Safety Net for all Sri Lankans.
Importantly, a number of IIHSs international partners attended this years forum, including representatives from Metropolia Helsinki University of Applied Sciences, Deakin University (Australia) and Peking University (China).
Further, there were over 103 publications in the 2018 BioInquirer journal, with 15 research publications submitted from government nursing training schools, which resulted from a Research Roadshow held between 2016 and 2018 that was conducted island-wide at all Nursing Training Schools with over 5,000 reached.
Commenting on 14th BioInquirer Annual Academic Sessions and Workshop, Dr. Kithsiri Edirisinghe, CEO and Director, Academics at IIHS, said, BioInquirer is an incubator where evidence based knowledge is dispersed to the community in the form of Conferences, Research Forums, Community Projects and Workshops.
In 2016, IIHS aligned with the 17 UN SDGs and since then all research projects have aligned with the goals. Further, in 2018, the final year undergraduate students of IIHS conducted research on vulnerable populations in Sri Lanka. At IIHS, we encourage students to step outside the box and engage in community projects which would align their work with global initiatives towards health and well-being.
As Sri Lankas premier International University Learning Center (IULC), IIHS has for 16 years offered programs ranging from Certificates to PhDs.
Valuing a SMART learning environment, with a continuously upgraded curriculum through the input of its partners and aligned with international trends in education and teaching, IIHS produced the first Collaborative Teaching in environment in South Asia  a system which supports learning outcomes whilst students are provided with ownership of their learning experience.
IIHS prides itself on being the No. 1 in terms of Research, Evidence Based Practice and Reflective Practice arming students with a skill set to understand innovative and unique trends in healthcare. Further, students during their time at IIHS engage in multiple Community Projects so they build empathy and learn about existing local and international healthcare issues at a community level.
IIHS has identified multiple areas in the learning process, which would make a student internationally geared. Distinct areas and features include personality development and soft skill development whilst gaining a thorough understanding of traditional methods education versus modern virtual education.

A laudable suggestion
There is no doubt that with every breath we take, we experience the very freedom gained for us by the valiant members of the Security Forces and Police by defeating the LTTE, the worlds most ruthless terrorist organisation, nearly 10 years ago. The nation will forever be indebted to these personnel who achieved victory over terrorism under the guidance of the then President and current Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Now that peace and normality have been firmly established throughout the country, there has been an unfortunate tendency to forget and neglect the brave personnel of the Tri-Forces, Police and Civil Defence Department who made it all possible. In fact, the previous Government drastically scaled back the victory celebrations held every year on May 19 and gave it up altogether last year. This would no doubt have hurt the sentiments of our war heroes and their families  we must remember that thousands of young people sacrificed their lives to secure the freedom that we enjoy today. Many others will never see again with their eyes or hear again with their ears. Others have lost their limbs in battles with the enemy. We must remember them all the time and not just on Victory Day.
But there is another aspect that many have forgotten. A soldier is a skilled, trained person who has acquired a multitude of talents on and off the battlefield. When the former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa co-opted the Tri-Services into the task of improving and beautifying the Colombo City, there were many who criticized him. It turned out to be a sound decision in the end and the results which one can see today speak for themselves. An officer or soldier who retires at 55 or even earlier is thus an asset to the Nation, who has many more years left to serve in various other capacities. One must not forget the disabled soldiers, who too have been trained in various tasks.
This was exactly the crux of President Maithripala Sirisenas address at the inaugural session of the Conference of Officers of Tri-Forces and Senior Non-commissioned Officers held on Monday. The Conference was held under the theme, The professional duty of the commissioned officers of Tri-Forces and senior non-commissioned officers facing challenges. President Sirisena said the mature skills, knowledge and experience of the Tri-Forces veterans could be put to good use in the best interests of the country.
The President said as Commander-in-Chief of the Tri-Forces, he would prefer if a solution is brought forward through discussions from within the Tri-Forces and he is ready to implement these suggestions which would be beneficial to the country. It would also be interesting to study the projects started by other countries for the benefit of retired Forces personnel.
By the time military officers who have served for many years reach the point where they mature in knowledge and experience and reach retirement age, it is our duty to find ways as to how they can best serve the country as highly skilled persons with knowledge, the President said.
This is a praiseworthy move, because there are many sectors of the economy which can benefit from the experience of ex-Services and ex-Police personnel. The Forces have already diversified to other, usually civilian sectors such as tourism and travel. Such non-battlefield experience will come in handy as the Forces enter more peacetime ventures. There could even be many job openings abroad for our retired Forces personnel, even outside the security and surveillance industry. For example, their experience in the rehabilitation of former combatants could be needed by other countries whose conflicts have ended recently. De-mining is another area where our Army personnel have excelled in. The Navy has pioneered a low-cost water-filtration system that has already seen many installations. The Air Force is involved in the redevelopment of domestic airports.
Indeed, we need to get more serving and retired Forces and Police personnel involved in the national development process in peacetime. There is no need to demobilize the Army and the other Forces as some have suggested, but we need to re-mobilize the Forces and their human and other resources for peacetime imperatives such as infrastructure development. This will give them an additional sense of belonging that is much better than idling their time away at a camp.
The Forces must move ahead with the times and the new challenges. Although there is no sign that the LTTE could re-materialize, the Forces must be vigilant all the time. Besides, there are many transnational terror groups that may try to gain a foothold here. Thus intelligence plays a major role in the day-to-day operations of the Security Forces. Since many of these terror groups are necessarily global, intelligence sharing with other countries is a sine quo non for defeating the designs of these groups. From gun-running to narcotics to human trafficking, there are many new challenges that our Security Forces have to face and tackle now and in the coming years. They must be fully equipped and trained to take on these new dimensions of national security.

Masses are for General Election - Analyst
The political scenario of October 26 is an expression of the economic, social, political, and cultural crisis that has existed in the country for a long time. A general election is the only shortest possible way towards finding a solution to this problem, international news analyst and critic, Mohan Samaranayake said.
Samaranayake said the ongoing parliament has consistently failed to find solutions to this crisis at a press conference organized by the Democratic Solidarity at the Mahaweli Center in Colombo yesterday.On the contrary, the majority of the public representatives in the house are found to be sold out for money. Therefore, he said the public should be given the opportunity to elect new members to parliament to start on a new journey.
He noted that some parties had exaggerated that the situation is the result of a constitutional plot. But, it is not so.
This is a crisis that countries like Sri Lanka have been facing throughout the post-Independence era,he said.
Samaranayake said if such a decision was not taken by the President on October 26, the proposed constitution to the country would have been passed by now and the entire country would have been facing serious consequences due to that.
Senior Lecturer Dhamma Dissanayake said the prevailing crisis in the political arena needs long-term solutions, but they are proposing a general election to be held as a short-tem solution.
He said all the constitutions and the amendments made so far except the 1972 Constitution were based on the political power struggle of each political party which was in power.
Saying that the prevailing electoral system should be amended, Dissanayake also made two suggestions as long-term solutions. He suggested that MPs should not be given ministerial portfolios and also the people of the country should be given the opportunity to select the candidates contesting the elections.
He also said that political parties at present are not real parties but, they are political gangs.

Ranil conspired to gain Presidents powers - Minister
Former Prime Minister and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe had sent a letter on January 6, 2015 to President Maithripala Sirisena requesting him to make him Prime Minister and to issue a gazette notification handing over all powers to him, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Media and Digital Infrastructure Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara disclosed.
He told the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, as two former Cabinet Ministers of the 2015 Cabinet, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe and himself very clearly knew what had happened in 2015. The entire campaign ended on the night January 5 2015. The 19th Amendment was brought in at midnight the same day. The Supreme Court did not permit inclusion of certain sections of the Amendment without a two thirds majority and a referendum.
Minister Jayasekara said the UNP Leader tried his best to make the President a puppet. This was the main intention of the 2015 election campaign, he said.
The UNP supporters who voted in 2015 knew nothing. President Sirisena did his utmost to turn all anti Sri Lankan projects and programmes into Sri Lankan friendly ventures without revealing this to the country. His (Presidents) struggle was silent. But his patience crossed the red line when the former PM tried to sell the Eastern terminal of the Colombo harbour.
Minister Jayasekara pointed out that the UNP Leader was now shouting from the rooftops and on the streets about the legality of the PM and the Cabinet. He should challenge those appointments in the courts without simply shouting slogans.
Govt. to decide on attending Parliament today
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara responding to a question raised by a journalist said that they would decide at the Government Party Meeting this morning, (29) whether to participate in the debate on the allocation of funds to the Prime Minister, to be taken up in Parliament today.

Ranil has become a puppet of Western countries - Hewapathirana
UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and former Minister Lakshman Kiriella have become a cats paw of Parliamentarian Sumanthiran, Deshapremi Eksath Jathika Pakshaya General Secretary Sugath Hewapathirana said.
Those who are backed by the Tamil diaspora and Western countries are now pulling the strings of UNP puppets in Parliament, he said.
He said that UNP leader has become a puppet of Western countries and those who are dreaming of becoming the future UNP leaders are keeping mum.
We believe that Wickremesinghe or those who are aspiring to become the next leaders cannot revive this party and our party is organising the UNP members at grassroots level to lead an uprising against the UNP leader, he said.
The stage is set for an uprising against the UNP leader due to growing distrust in the leadership, Hewapathirana said.
He said that he wants a party with patriotic UNPers who do not disgrace with the members of the clergy, including members of the Maha Sangha and Archbishops.
Hewapathirana added that the United National Party lacked a firm policy or vision with the death of UNP stalwarts such as Gamini Dissanayake and victory for the party is becoming elusive.
The United National Party under the leadership of Ranil Wickremesinghe is facing a major set back as it is distancing it self from the people at grassroots level, he said.
He said that UNP leaders have lost the common touch and they have forgotten the UNP members at grassroots level.
The Deshapremi Eksath Jathika Pakshaya has been formed as an alternative to the UNP which is not concerned about the country or its future.
Addressing the maiden press conference of the party in Colombo, Hewapathirana said his partys policy is based on a policy of a unitary Sri Lanka where people of all communities can live in peace.
We want to have a sort of UNP that will not sell national assets to foreigners for a song.
He said that the new party will announce a five fold programme to revive the countrys economy while safeguarding the nations sovereignty, dignity and national identity.
UNPers are today considered as a lot who have plundered the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and who have sold national assets for a song, he said.
He said that the UNP members at village level are considered unpatriotic due to the policies of the incumbent UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Hewapathirana said that UNP backbenchers do not air their wrath against the leader as they are in fear of loosing their privileges.
The UNP Provincial Councillors dont raise these issues as their candidature at the next election would be denied, he said.
He said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is the only symbol of Sinhala Buddhist in the UNP. He is the only Sinhala Buddhist leader who represents the United National Party. He has lost his independence and he has been hijacked by the UNP leader, Hewapathirana said.

TISL gives statement to CIABOC
Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) yesterday gave a detailed statement to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) with regard to the audio recording released by UNP MP and former Minister Palitha Range Bandara on the alleged attempts to offer him a bribe to cross over.
The TISL had already lodged a complaint to the CIABOC on November 5, relating to allegations of attempts to bribe MP Range Bandara and this was a follow-up of that compliant.
According to the taped conversation, a third party tries to offer a financial incentive to UNP MP Range Bandara to commit the political act.
TISL Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said TISL officials highlighted to CIABOC investigators that the contents of the telephone conversation recording shared with the media recently by the UNP MP clearly indicate an offence under Section 14 of the Bribery Act.
There are three key points to flag from the recorded conversation,TISL said. One is the offer of Rs. 500 million to cross over; secondly, the offer to pay the amount in US dollars; and thirdly, the willingness to carry out the transaction in Anamaduwa.
The tape allegedly also contains a promise that UNP MP Range Bandra would be given a ministerial portfolio when he crosses over.
The offence of bribing a Member of Parliament carries a prescribed prison term of up to seven years under the provisions of the Bribery Act.
CIABOC officials confirmed to TISL today that an investigation has been initiated into the complaint and that statements would be obtained from the relevant parties.
We hope that upon the conclusion of this investigation, those who sought to bribe MPs will be held to account and that anybody attempting to do so in the future is mindful of the consequences, Obeyesekere said.

Ukraine warns of full-scale war with Russia
UKRAINE: Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Tuesday warned of the threat of full-scale war and said Russia had sharply increased its military presence on their shared border as tensions escalate between the ex-Soviet neighbours.
The crisis also threatened growing diplomatic fallout with US President Donald Trump warning that he may cancel a long-awaited summit with Russias Vladimir Putin.
Trump is scheduled to meet Putin at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires at the end of this week, but he told The Washington Post that it would depend on the results of a report about the incident being prepared by his national security advisers.
Maybe I wont have the meeting. Maybe I wont even have the meeting, he said.
In Ukraine, Poroshenko warned that the clash at sea could herald more drastic developments in the simmering Ukraine-Russia military standoff.
I dont want anyone to think this is fun and games. Ukraine is under threat of full-scale war with Russia, the president said in an interview with national television.
The number of Russian units deployed along the Ukraine-Russian border has grown dramatically while the number of Russian tanks has tripled, Poroshenko said, citing intelligence reports but giving no precise timescale for the buildup.
He spoke after Russian forces seized three of Kievs ships off the coast of Crimea on Sunday and captured 24 Ukrainian sailors.
On Tuesday, a court in Simferopol, the main city in Russian-annexed Crimea, ordered 12 of the sailors to be held in pre-trial detention for two months. Three hospitalised sailors were also formally detained for two months. The rest are to appear in court on Wednesday.
The move stoked already high tensions between Moscow and Kiev, as Russia continues to accuse the sailors of crossing illegally into Russian waters and of ignoring warnings from its border guards.
Kiev has demanded the release of the sailors and urged Western allies to impose further sanctions on Moscow.
The US State Department on Tuesday termed Russias actions a dangerous escalation and said Washington wants to see our European allies doing more to assist Ukraine.
Putin on Tuesday warned Ukraine against any reckless acts after Kiev declared martial law in response to Moscows seizure of the navy vessels.
The Ukrainian parliament late on Monday voted in favour of Poroshenkos request for the introduction of martial law in border areas for 30 days.
This gives Ukrainian authorities the power to mobilise citizens with military experience, regulate the media and restrict public rallies in affected areas.
In a phone conversation with German Chancellor Angela Merkel Tuesday, Putin expressed serious concern over its introduction.
He said he hoped Berlin could intervene with Ukrainian authorities to dissuade them from further reckless acts.
Moscow has accused Kiev of planning Sundays confrontation as a provocation aimed at drumming up support for Poroshenko ahead of elections next year and convincing Western governments to impose further sanctions on Russia.
Putin said Kievs actions were clearly taken in view of the election campaign in Ukraine.
Sundays incident has been playing out on Russian and Ukrainian television screens, with dramatic footage of Russian ships chasing down a Ukrainian tugboat that was trying to pass through the Kerch Strait from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov. Western governments have rallied behind Kiev in the dispute, accusing Russia of illegally blocking access to the Sea of Azov and of taking military action without justification.
The European Union, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and others expressed support for Kiev on Monday, in statements pro-Kremlin newspaper Izvestia denounced as predictably anti-Russian.UN chief Antonio Guterres on Tuesday called for maximum restraint, urging both sides to take steps without delay to contain this incident and reduce tensions. - AFP

UNPs move to submit motion  in Parliament illegal - Counsel
The United National Partys move to submit a motion seeking to halt financial allocations to the new Cabinet is unlawful, legal experts said.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana said the United National Party was set to submit a motion in Parliament on November 30 seeking to halt financial allocations to the new Cabinet, a move which he refers to as being unlawful.
How can the UNP, which is the Opposition now, file a motion in Parliament, he queried. Only a MP from the ruling party has the right to file such motions. He said adding that there was already a Finance Minister capable enough to make those decisions.
A vote is reported to be taken up today on the curtailment of expenditure for the Office of the Prime Minister. In addition to this, the UNP is also in the process of moving a motion on Friday to curtail all funds allocated to the new Cabinet.
There is no provision for a member of the opposition to move such a motion in parliament. There is no clause in the standing orders which allows for such motions to be upheld, he said. How can Parliament convene when there is a Stay Order which demands that the status quo of parliament be stayed. They cannot even hold sittings.
He added that judiciary and legislature are both on a collision course and will be in direct conflict with each other if Parliament continues to support such motions and proceedings.

Relief for Samurdhi families:
Wimal requests President, PMs assistance
Housing and Social Welfare Minister Wimal Weerawansa yesterday said that he requested President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to provide immediate solutions to the problems faced by Samurdhi officials and 1.5 million Samurdhi beneficiary families.
The Minister said that he made this request from the President and the Prime Minister when he took over the Housing and Social Welfare portfolio.
We have succeeded in providing an immediate solution to a problem faced by the Samurdhi Development Department employees. An officer for every Grama Niladhari Division was appointed when this Movement began in 1995, he said.
The Minister added that the Department employees faced many issues during the previous regime and their issues should be immediately addressed.
There are 1,073 Samurdhi Banks around the country. Around 28.8 percent of people are living below the poverty line when the Samurdhi Movement started. By 2017, only 6.5 per cent were living below the poverty line and the Samurdhi Movement helped alleviate poverty among our population, Minister Weerawansa said
He added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa established the Samurdhi Development Department by bringing five institutions to its fold.They are the Sri Lanka Samurdhi Authority, Up Country Development Authority, Up Country Village Rehabilitation Authority, Sri Lanka Southern Development authority and the Samurdhi Commissioners Department.
He said that 119 out of 27,000 Samurdhi officials have retired from the Department during the last regime but none of them received pension benefits.
One hundred and seventy eight officials have died in the Department and none of them receive pension benefits and the government should ensure that their families receive pension benefits as other officials in the government service, he added.
A group of Samurdhi officials have already filed a case before court seeking ETF, EPF and pension benefits for them.
We cannot wait any longer. If court determines that Department employees deserve more benefits, we will provide them these benefits with retrospective effect, Minister Weerawansa said.
The Minister said that the objective of forming the Samurdhi Movement is to alleviate poverty in the country.
He said that he will continue the programmes implemented by the department with the addition of new methodologies.
