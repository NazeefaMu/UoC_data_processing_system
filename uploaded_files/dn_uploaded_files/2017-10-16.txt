Embracing digital payments can save global cities US$ 470 bn annually
Visa, the global leader in digital payments technology, has announced an independent study, conducted by Roubini ThoughtLab and and commissioned by Visa, examining the economic impact of increasing the use of digital payments in major cities around the world, including Colombo, which could help the city realize, US$200 million annual net benefits.
The study estimates that relying more on electronic payments, such as cards and mobile payments, could yield a net benefit of up to US$470 billion per year across the 100 cities studied  roughly the equivalent to 3% of the average GDP for these cities.
For instance, Colombo, with a population of 694,000 and GDP of US$6.5 billion, could gain US$200 million annual net benefits. Estimated catalytic impacts for the city over the next 15 years include 20.4 basis point increase in GDP growth rate and 2.1% increase in employment.
Cashless Cities: Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments, is a unique study that quantifies the potential net benefits experienced by cities which move to an achievable level of cashlessnessdefined as the entire population of a city moving to digital payment usage equal to the top 10% of users in that city today. The study does not look at eliminating cash.
Rather, it seeks to quantify the potential benefits and costs of significantly increasing the use of digital payments. By reducing reliance on cash, the study estimates the immediate and long-term benefits for three main groups - consumers, businesses and governments. According to the study, these benefits could add up to combined direct net benefits of approximately US$470 billion across the 100 cities that were analyzed.
Consumers across the 100 cities could achieve nearly US$28 billion per year in estimated direct net benefits. This impact would be derived from factors including up to 3.2 billion hours in time savings conducting banking, retail and transit transactions, in addition to a reduction in cash-related crime. Businesses across the 100 cities could achieve more than US$312 billion per year in estimated direct benefits.
This impact would be derived from factors including up to 3.1 billion hours in time savings processing incoming and outgoing payments and increased sales revenues stemming from extended online and in-store customer bases.
The study also found that accepting cash and checks costs businesses 7.1 cents of every dollar received compared to 5 cents of every dollar collected from digital sources.
Governments across the 100 cities could achieve nearly US$130 billion per year in estimated direct benefits.
This impact would be derived from factors including increased tax revenues, increased economic growth, cost savings from administrative efficiencies and lower criminal justice costs due to reduced cash-related crime.
T. R. Ramachandran, Group Country Manager, Visa, India & South Asia, said, cities are the new engines of economic growth. To unlock their true economic potential, and become globally competitive, cities must embrace digital payments.
This global study shows how becoming more cashless delivers real benefits to governments, businesses and consumers, stimulating long-term economic growth. Colombo could achieve, on average, US$200 million in annual net benefits  roughly the equivalent to 3 percent of the citys average GDP.
As cities increase use of digital payments, the positive impacts can extend beyond financial benefits to consumers, businesses, and government. The shift to digital payments also may have a catalytic effect on the citys overall economic performance, including GDP, employment, wage, and productivity growth.
Lou Celi, Head of Roubini ThoughtLab, said, The use of digital technologies - from smart phones and wearables to artificial intelligence and driverless cars - is rapidly transforming how city dwellers shop, travel, and live. Without a firm foundation in electronic payments, cities will not be able to fully capture their digital future, according to our analysis.
Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments offers 61 recommendations for policymakers to help their cities become more efficient through greater adoption of digital payments. Recommendations include undertaking financial literacy programs to help move the unbanked into the banking system, implementing incentives to stimulate innovation focused on scaling new payment technologies, implementing secure open-loop payment systems across all transportation networks and more.
Visa and Roubini ThoughtLab created an online data visualization tool as a companion to Cashless Cities: Realizing the Benefits of Digital Payments. Using the data visualization tool, individuals can increase or decrease the level of digital usage in each of the 100 cities included in the study to better explore the benefits of a world, less dependent on cash. More information on the report could be obtained at www.visa.com/cashlesscities.

I didnt intend to insult the judiciary: Gnanasara Thera

Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera said he didnt intend to insult the judiciary with the remarks made inside the Homagama Magistrates Court in January 2016.
Gnanasara Thera made this remarks as a defense witness regarding the contempt of court case filed against him.
I had no intention to insult the judiciary or any other person in court. The emotional feelings created subsequent to an order to further remand the army intelligence officers led to address in open court, Gnanasara Thera said.
Meanwhile, Gnanasara Thera accepted the fact that he told inside Homagama Magistrate's court that he would not accept 'White Man's Law' (suddage neethiya).
The Court of Appeal hearing the contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court today concluded recording evidence from Gnanasara Thera.
When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena further trial fixed for October 30.
Former Homage Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate and Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris had also given evidence in this regard.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General. President's Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnanasara Thera.
In a surprising turn of events, onJanuary 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.

The rebel
Do women who take over the ownership of businesses previously owned and run by their fathers face unique issues How do they stand up to the image of the male role that was in charge earlier Or do they create their own image and take the reins regardless of ill omens My father was a strong personality. I had to shut down my personality before I took over. It was more a mission than a career path. There were cultural differences and I could sense that people were in two minds before they nodded for my decisions. It took some time for the management to accept a different personality, says Sanasa Development Bank (SDBL), Chairperson, Samadanie Kiriwandeniya.
It was a learning process for me as well. I received immense support from the Board. I made changes in the management as I wanted the bank to shine not individuals. Those who could not perform had to quit as I wanted the team to be highly professional and technically qualified, she added.
Being the daughter of Sanasas visionary leader, Dr. P. A. Kiriwandeniya whose commitment is legendary within the country, she had to steer ahead the work he began. There were five girls in the family. Who is going to take after and follow fathers footsteps was always a question. From very young days, the social movement fascinated me. I read extensively about revolutions. I loved to go around the country and always believed that the local community has the strength to do revolutionary things. So I took up the challenge of creating innovations through Sanasa bank to direct funds and deliver proper products to uplift the lives of the rural community, Kiriwandeniya said.
Samadanie Kiriwandeniya was appointed the Chairperson of the Sanasa Development Bank (SDBL) in 2011 thus becoming the youngest Chairperson in the banking industry. She is also a Corporate Leader of the Sanasa Corporative Group. She holds senior management experience in the fields of participatory development, gender issues management, microfinance and conflict resolution. In 2013 she was figured among the 50 most powerful women in Sri Lanka and was ranked as the 6th most powerful business leader for three consecutive years by Echelon Magazine. Kiriwandeniya has obtained her basic degree in Sociology and continued with a Masters Degree in the same field at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.
I received my education in three schools: Musaeus College Colombo, Kandy High School and St Josephs College, Kegalle. Then I entered the Peradeniya University and completed my Masters at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. As a child I grew up seeing the Sanasa movement my father created. Starting at Sanasa was not really a job selection for me, but basically I wanted to support the effort of my fathers vision to build a self-reliant rural community. Working with a Canadian Corporative Organisation in the development field especially in Northern and Eastern Provinces equipped me with a lot of experience. I first started at the Marketing Department negotiating with international organizations to contribute in the development of the rural community. I created the international relations of the bank. We had to place proper strategies and selectively engage into partnership with international community after the tsunami catastrophe which we did for two years successfully, Kiriwandeniya said.
Sanasa Development Bank started with a social movement in order to support development project.
Sanasa Development Bank is a unique bank committed to uplifting the standards of living for low income Sri Lankan families with its range of microfinance activities. The ownership of the bank is confined to Sanasa Movement, the only microfinance cooperative network in Sri Lanka which covers all provinces with 8,424 primary societies. It reaches close to one million members and over three million individuals.
No one ever asks a man whether they can run a company and be a father at the same time. This question which a career woman is always asked sends a subtle message to young women that they have to sacrifice their motherhood to excel in their careers.
Whether you are a man or a woman you can contribute meaningfully to the society. You have to hang on and think there is always someone going through the same journey. Many who were close to me asked me to quit at that time as it was quite a stress handling children and work. If you are prepared and committed you can overcome circumstances. It is a learning path. You have to compromise in order to learn something. Negotiating and balancing every aspect of life is important. However, it is rewarding at the end, Kiriwandeniya said.
We were a continuously moving family. With a husband who has his professional duties it was not easy looking after two daughters but we were able to expose them to our work. All working mothers should be given the opportunity to expose their children to work life. Looking at what parents do will encourage children and they will learn without words and structures. I was never behind my daughters and did not wait for occasion to make the perfect vacation but used every opportunity to mingle with them and spend time meaningfully, she added.
Kiriwandeniya says that she earns respect from her family for what she does to the society. I hardly get a chance to accomplish my responsibilities as a house wife. My family respects me for the contribution I make to the society and country. You have to know your priorities and when you are a woman you have to have quality and smart partnerships. It could be with your extended family, maids or neighbours. You have to master the art of building relationships with others to manage work and personal life. A womans life is connected with others. You have to take others with you to succeed. Every time a woman takes two steps forward she will be reversed a step behind due to family obligations. A woman has to have a holistic approach otherwise finally she will be on top but not have anyone around her, she said. Success behind me was, I was not prepared to give up or lose. I had a mission and knew my capabilities and I am focused to go further and assist the community which was my fathers vision and dream, she concluded.

## Title: Sri Lankas poor will benefit from more economic freedom

Sri Lankas poor will benefit from more economic freedom
Sri Lankas poor stands to gain big benefits if more economic freedoms are given, while businesses and foreign investors will also be encouraged, participants of an economic freedom summit by Advocata Institute, a free market think tank, said.
To understand what economic freedom really means, one has to consider what happens when such liberties are taken away with controls and restrictions, Rohan Samarajiva, head of LirneAsia, a regional policy research body said.
The 1970s closed economy era was classic example, he said. Malnutrition and unemployed rose during the period. Sirimal Abeyratne, professor of economics at Colombo University said there was little understanding in Sri Lanka about economic freedoms or its effects with many people being taught to think that controls were good.
People know a lot about political freedoms, but not about economic freedoms, Abeyratne said.Economic freedom affects all of us in our daily lives. Many of the controls from the 1970s still exist despite several rounds of liberalizations.

He said there was time when some people marched on streets saying they were prepared to have tea without sugar. Abeyratne said all laws should apply equally to everyone, like a red light applies to all on the road regardless of the person.
Then economic freedoms will bring benefits and scams will reduce, he said. If property was not protected investors will also not come, he said. There was a misconception that economic freedoms were only good for investors or foreigners, a seminar participant said.
The event began with a plenary session and closed door discussions with industry, academia and policy makers to develop steps to improve economic freedom and greater prosperity.
Minister of Special Assignments, Sarath Amunugama, who graced the seminar as the chief guest said, around the time of independence there was a belief that a country would make the best use of resources and develop fast if there was central planning by the state.
Some development happened especially in heavy industries but later problems emerged.
China was one of the first countries to recognize the problem and under then Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, and later Deng Xiaoping relaxed many controls.
They realized that domestic resources was not enough to take the country forward, Amunugama said. Investors are not charities. Immense freedoms have been given to foreign businesses to invest, to hire workers and also the freedom to take away profits to their home countries. Now if you go to Shanghai across the river, you will see massive neon signs. They all advertise multi-national brands. Vietnam another socialist country had achieved major gains by moving away from central planning and controls, he said.
Vietnam started liberalizing through its Chnh sch <U+1ED5>i M<U+1EDB>i (Renewal policy) in 1984 though it ook many years for investors to be convince, economic analysts say. Amunugama said the concept of economic freedom was relative and it did not mean that there was no role for the state or regulation. Fred McMahon who manages the Fraser Institute Economic Freedom project said the freedom of one person should be exercised without stepping on the freedoms of others.
Individuals have economic freedom when property they acquire without the use of force, fraud, or theft is protected from physical invasions by others he said.They are free to use, exchange, or give their property as long as their actions do not violate the identical rights of others.
In the Fraser Institute economic freedom index, rule of law is a key aspect. Rule of law, which treats everyone equally will protect the weak from the strong and powerful. Philosophers have pointed out that those who take away the freedoms of others are usually those who are armed - which is the armed state and gangsters of all kind who may steal and use arms.
Meanwhile McMahon said Sri Lanka had improved its position in the Economic Freedom of the World Index to 94 out of 159 countries but more benefits will come to the people if controls were relaxed.
Sri Lankas legal system had a rank of 73, but on sound money (how good the central bank is in providing low inflation money) it was 135. In free trade also Sri Lanka scored badly at 135 out 159. Sri Lanka cannot be a success story by trading with 20 Million people. But Sri Lanka can with few billion people, McMohan said.
Our performance at 135th out of 159 nations on Trade is not at all satisfactory. Especially for a small island like Sri Lanka. There was a direct co-relation with economic freedom and prosperity he said.
The average income of the poorest 10 percent of the population of the quarter of countries with the most economic freedom was about 10,000 US dollars a year, he said. But in the countries were least free the bottom 10 percent of people earned about 1,000 US dollars a year.
Countries like Malaysia and Korea scored very high on economic freedom also had high living standards, compared to India and Sri Lanka. The poor in countries with greater economic freedoms had far higher incomes than in countries with lower levels of freedoms, McMahon said.
Political freedoms were generally higher in countries with greater economic freedoms, he said.
Samarajiva said political freedoms provided the space to fight for economic freedoms but it could also be robbed by a vocal minority if those who were hit by controls stayed silent without speaking out.

Acne cake anyone
A baker has created a disgusting acne cake filled with with realistic puss-filled spots you can actually squeeze.
Malaysian company The Cakescape created the sweet treat complete with a womans face and red blotchy spots.
The rather realistic looking pimples are squeezable, oozing out clumps of pale cake heads when you press on their sides.
People were divided on Facebook after the company shared the cake on its page.
Hui Ling Tham wrote: Cake that will give you satisfaction while Michelle Chong simply wrote Ewwww!.
The rise of the pimple popping craze, thanks partly to Dr Sandra Lee (aka Dr Pimple Popper ), also led to the rather revolting pimple cupcake that trended last year.
Californian bakers Blessed by Baking whipped up some very realistic looking pimple cupcakes.
The cakes appears to have a skin-coloured fondant with a small reddish-pink circle around the protrusion.
And in the centre is a small hole filled with yellow puss, which appears to be made from custard or lemon curd.
Footage of the cakes emerged online after the creative bakers sent them to spot-popping queen Dr Lee.
Sharing video of the cake last July, she wrote: How can something so pus-like taste so good!! Pimple cupcakes by the amazing.
The clip has since been viewed more than 1.7million times on Instagram. Mirror

Airbus should have been cautious on  SriLankans financial plight before deal - Eran
State Minister for Finance Eran Wickremeratne had a dig at Airbus Industries, France and said that they should have been more responsible when selling A350 aircraft to SriLankan which was going through major financial losses.
Airbus Industries should have been more cautious and should have advised the SriLankan Airline negotiators during the Rajapaksa administration against the future financial implications of this deal, he said at the forum organized by Advocata Institute at Global towers hotel last week. They (airbus) also have to bear responsibility for the sale as they too had a responsibility.
The State-run SriLankan Airlines bought over a dozen A350 and A330 aircraft from Airbus via the leasing company AerCap in a deal valued at over two billion US dollars during the time and the Minister it was sad that they had to pay a penalty of over 100 million dollars to cancel the deal for three aircraft. Sri Lanka now wants to cancel the balance four A350 aircraft order as well.
State Minister also said that the airline is still in Red and the government keeps pumping money. As for me I dont have any idea as to how to bail out SriLankan.
Meanwhile Chief Economist Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, Anushka Wijesinghe said that though some Minsters and officials believe that three- wheelers was a menace it was not exactly so.
Three-wheelers when it comes to the rural areas is the last mile transport options for people where organized transports ends. Its also the makeshift ambulance to take pregnant women and way side casualties to the nearest hospitals.
He also pointed out that its the only transport option in rural estates. The Minister too admitted this fact and said that systems should be brought to discipline them.

AIS Innovation Centre to develop computational thinking
Asian International School (AIS), Colombo, in partnership with IgniterSpace and Create Lab of Singapore, last week unveiled its AIS Innovation Centre aimed at augmenting computational thinking and creative problem solving in students.
The Centre will house facilities for science, technology, robotics, engineering, architecture and mathematics (STREAM) education and its state-of-the-art maker-space lab has been custom built to suit the needs of the school providing a hands-on learning experience to the student population.
AIS has carefully mapped out a curriculum where innovation teaching has been cleverly integrated to the classroom curriculum, thereby providing a seamless flow of information and knowledge.
In keeping with its philosophy of providing education measuring up to global standards, AIS has partnered with Create Lab of Singapore for the program on coding and robotics and IgniterSpace for the innovation teaching program.
The school has already recorded tremendous success in art and design where more than 50% of the students obtained A* grades for Fine Arts at the Edexcel IGCSE examinations.
Officials from Create Lab and IgniterSpace at the opening of the AIS Innovation Centre
Principal of AIS Harshana Perera said: The AIS Innovation Centre is the logical next step in our drive to integrate creative, technological thinking to our bright students from a young age. It goes hand-in-hand with our curriculum that encourages students to not only think but actually live outside the proverbial box. Needless to say, the results speak for themselves.
Create Lab CEO Thilan Wickremasinghe was also highly optimistic. Were thrilled to have partnered with AIS to facilitate this high-tech innovation hub, keeping in line with our vision of delivering a 100% student-focused learning experience while not forgetting to have fun.
Create Lab works with educators from Oxford, Singapore University of Technology and Design (a collaboration with MIT), Singapore Management University, IMDA Labs and NUS Enterprise to inspire children to become creators with technology and prepare them to become 21st century leaders.
Co-partner IgniterSpace is a fully-fledged tech-education institute backed by state-run tech giants such as COSTI, SLASSCOM and ICTA and employs over 15 full-time and 30 part-time instructors.
Founder Hasith Yaagahawita said: At IgniterSpace we believe that knowledge is a perishable commodity, in that what one learns today may be invalidated by a new discovery made tomorrow. This is specifically true in the rapidly advancing tech-era today. Just holding knowledge does not guarantee the usefulness of it. So when we were invited to be part of this initiative by AIS, we didnt hesitate.
The distinguished gathering of strategic partners, parents and teachers were very excited in looking forward to the value addition and quality enrichment which the students will experience as a result of the new initiative of the Innovation Centre.
AIS Innovation Centre is equipped with facilities for STREAM education to enhance computational thinking and creative problem solving in students

Tribute to Ranil Wijayapala
An indefatigable defender of truth
Just over 20 years ago, when I was Assistant News Editor of the Daily News, three young men and a young woman walked into the editorial. Before being ushered into the Editors room, I managed to talk to them. I got to know their namesRanil Wijayapala, Bharatha Malawararachchi, Uditha Kumarasinghe and Nadira Gunatilleke. Little did I think that one of themRanil Wijayapalawould become the News Editor of the Daily News in a few short years.
As young people barely out of school, they had the desire and drive to make it big in journalism. Ranil was a young man who embodied these qualities perfectly, which helped him to rise rapidly through the ranks and become the News Editor. Ranil loved his job, but he loved his friends and colleagues even more. He had a good heart and a zest for life, which is why everyone here in the Sunday Observer just cannot believe he is gone forever from our midst.
Ranil was a man of peace who would not hurt a fly. So when he expressed a desire to cover the war for the Daily News, I was a bit surprised. But I realised that underneath that serene outlook was a man who had nerves of steel. Ranil came to journalism at a time when the war had taken a serious turn. The Forces had suffered some setbacks, but were intent on turning the tables on their enemy. For the next 12 years or so, Ranil would cover their every move against the LTTE until victory was achieved.
For Ranil, there was a personal connection to the conflict as well. His brother is in the Army and he was naturally worried about him, as any brother would. Apart from his own brother, everyone in the Army was a brother to him. The gates of all Security Forces camps opened for him any time of the day or night and many senior officers became his close friends. He always talked about soldiers as apey kollo (our boys).
Ranil could have obtained defence news over the telephone like most others did, but that cozy life was not for him. He wanted to be in the thick of the action, reporting from the battlefield as bullets and mortars whizzed past. Along with intrepid photographers Thilak Perera and Rukmal Gamage (Ranils closest friend), he travelled to all the battle zones, embedded in the Army ranks fighting the Tigers.
Not content with publishing just news items, Ranils superiors had the bright idea of turning him into a defence correspondent and analyst. He rose to this challenge without any hesitation and over the next few years, earned a reputation as one the finest contemporary defence correspondents in the country. His highly analytical Defence Column in the Daily News (also carried in the Sunday Observer with updates) was eagerly awaited by all readers. Military leaders, political leaders, embassy officials, fellow journalists and senior Government officials were all avid readers of the column. There were intelligence reports that the enemy leadership was also monitoring the column. The main significance of his column was that it was for the most part sent from the battlefield itself.
Having seen the horrors of war first hand, Ranil did not rejoice in it or glorify it. He has told me on more than one occasion that he wanted the war to end soon and peace to return. In fact, when the war ended in May 2009, Ranil was perhaps the happiest among us, for he did not like death and destruction at all. He knew it would probably spell the end of his popular column, but that was a small sacrifice in the overall scheme of things for Ranil. Being the versatile journalist that he is, Ranil turned with gusto to write about the de-mining, rehabilitation and reconciliation efforts now underway. Of course, Ranil always had a soft spot for Armed Forces, saying they are the saviours of the nation. Whenever he could help a disabled soldier or war heroes families through the newspaper, he did it without a second thought.
When Ranil was diagnosed with cancer around three years ago, it came as a great shock to all his colleagues and friends. 'How could someone this good and generous fall prey to this disease' was the question on everyones lips. But true to form, Ranil did not flinch one inch. The nerves of steel that carried him through the war years came to his defence. While some of his closest friends in the newspaper industry and in the Army could not even eat properly for a few days upon hearing the news, Ranil remained calm and composed. His wife Sriyani too refused to succumb to fear. Together, they fought it every step of the way.
Remarkably, Ranil turned up for work whenever he could, despite the high-intensity treatments. He even worked from home when he could not come, despite our pleas not to exert himself. No one could notice that he had any kind of illness from his jovial outlook. He was his usual self, cracking jokes and reaching out to his friends at all times. His was a pressure cooker jobNews Editor of the Sunday Observerbut he took it in his stride and continued his onerous duties. Ranil had an incredible zest for life and needless to say, lived his life to the fullest. Ranil personified courage, commitment, bravery and a search for truth as a journalist and as a human being. It is just heartbreaking that he was cut down in the prime of his life.
His two young sons Uvindu and Dinidu were his pride and joy. They doted on their father, who somehow found the time for them despite a hectic schedule that stretched well into the night especially on Fridays and Saturdays.
In beloved Sriyani, he found a partner who stood with him in good times and bad. Ranil was also blessed to have good friends who were with him literally to the end. His was a short but eventful, even adventurous life that has no place for regrets, no place for sadness. Thanks for the memories, Ranil.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Dr. Sarath Abeyakoon
An admirable doctor
Having closely associated with Sarath as a relative and friend for the past 10 years, I realised very early on that he was a unique person overflowing with admirable qualities that are uncommon in todays competitive society.
Sarath was an old boy of St. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. He was the Head Prefect in 1971 and later, passed out from the Colombo Medical Faculty. He was a caring and loving husband and father and a tower of strength to all his relations, friends and patients. Despite his busy professional life, Sarath never failed to visit his sister regularly.
I will never forget the Indian pilgrimage he and Luckshmi organised for his family including ourselves with great commitment and enthusiasm. He undertook this pilgrimage with great faith, making it an unforgettable experience. As usual, he took great care to ensure that we were all comfortable and relaxed including the driver and guide.
Sarath was devoted to his patients. His willingness to spend extensive time listening and explaining was exceptional. He often gave up his own time to support his patients and their families. He treated everyone equally. Saraths time-management skills were a great example to all budding professionals. He was never too busy for anyone. He always answered his phone regardless of the time of day and took time to have long conversations whether family, friend or patient and always made time for family and social commitments.
As an Oncologist of the Maharagama Cancer Institute, he served with dedication. Sarath never engaged in private practice. After retiring, he joined the private sector and was instrumental in setting up a state-of-the-art cancer treatment unit at Ceylinco Healthcare Services. Financial gain was never a priority in his professional career. He often did not charge patients in need and sometimes went a step further to support them if they needed help.
Sarath led a simple life, but was generous beyond measure. He always treated everyone equally, regardless of social standing, age, race or religion. I had the pleasure of observing Sarath during his involvement at a medical camp for expectant mothers organised by the SamaVihara. Sarath was involved in providing medical advice and distributing essential items and his caring and kind dedication was an example to us all. Sarath was a devout Buddhist who was always content with life. He was loved by his family members, friends, colleagues and patients. I have never heard anyone speak anything but positive words about him.
He always displayed Bodhisatwa qualities in his day-to-day life.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Berty Galahitiyawa
an exemplary broadcaster
With the demise of Berty Galahitiyawa, we lost an experienced and exemplary media person who was always ready to share his expertise with his colleagues. Galahitiyawa (Berty to his friends) was an unassuming and humble man who attempted to expand his extensive knowledge about literary and general activities even after his retirement by collecting and reading books written by contemporary authors in Sinhala and English.
In his early life, he was a resident of Ampitiya, Kandy. After his primary education, he won a fifth standard scholarship and entered the Talatuoya Central College. From there, he moved on to Nugawela Central College and completed his secondary education with flying colours. He entered the General Clerical Service thereafter and served in the Irrigation Department in remote areas like Minneriya, serving the pioneering farmers who had settled in the early colonization schemes like Hingurakgoda.
His untiring efforts to develop himself resulted in him following a course in journalism at the Sri Jayawardhanapura University, where he obtained distinctions. Later, he joined the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) and worked with veterans like H. M. Gunasekera and Thevis Guruge. He was a very popular newscaster. People still remember his sonorous and clear voice with which he used to read the news bulletins over the radio. He introduced new features like the Shanida Saadaya and Hela Urumaya to the radio programmes. He brought Colombo city to a stand-still on the day he broadcast a short programme adapting the War of the Worlds of H. G. Wells
Later, he was elevated to the position of the Director of the Training Division of the SLBC. He used to give nation-wide radio commentaries on the Kandy Perahera with H. M. Gunasekera long before the advent of the television services.
Recognising his valuable contribution to the media, he was appointed as the General Manager of the Independent Television Network (ITN) by the then Media Minister Dharmasiri Senanayaka. He held that position for three years from 2004. For a short time, he functioned as the Head of the Sri Lanka section at the Beijing Broadcasting Services in China.
May he attain Nibbana!

Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam
She was a formidable lady
It is hard for me to make sense of the loss of my aunt, my loku nanda, Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam, in terms of what she achieved and how she lived her life. Indeed, there are certain truths about my loku nanda that most people would agree upon. She was a formidable lady, an expert in her field of educational psychology and her intellect, determination and drive saw her advance from a school teacher to the Director General of an educational institute. Most will acknowledge that she helped a whole range of people. The author of dozens of books, hundreds of articles, numerous radio and television interviews and countless number of speeches at events, she was able to manage all this while being a wife, a mother, a sister, a cousin, a friend, an aunt, a grandmother and an overall inspiration.
So what do I want to tell about my loku nanda It is important to state that loku nanda was a constant presence in our lives. She was steadfast, strong, loving, kind, and generous to a fault. Her home, her personality became core to our lives to the extent that her home number 5993, which changed to 95993 to 2695993 is etched in my mind.
Others will say how my loku nanda was the eldest girl in a family of seven. That she was unique from the start as she was named Thilokasundari to highlight the aspirations of our grandparents who named all their childrenthree girls and four boyswith impressive names. But this name was the loftiest. The name of a queen of Sri Lanka, a name denoting the aspiration of two school teachers who later became school principals had for their daughter. Our grandparents, both of whom hailed from Gampaha, wanted all their children to go to school and university and that was why they left Gampaha to build their home in Punchi Borella. That was why they sent their sons to Ananda and the daughters to Vishaka and subsequently to Peradeniya.
From our family point of view, loku nanda had achieved a number of firsts. The first of her siblings to become a principal at the age of 29, to travel abroad, to get a doctorate. These achievements themselves are astounding at a time when women were expected to remain as housewives. While most people tried to get the best of the minutes in a day, she managed to balance marriage, motherhood and work and still have time for creativity. A prolific writer, her books on early childhood education, Buddhism, psychology and childrens novels reflected the complexity of her interests. The photographs of her family and the numerous awards received for her work were given pride-of-place on top of her china-cabinet. That reflected the dual role she played and what she valued. How, I puzzled, did she manage to find time to do this
I believe that people know how she achieved all she did from interacting with her, from her autobiography, and from her own words. What must be highlighted is that my loku nanda accomplished all she did without erasing her femininity to overcome the challenges she faced. She was always smartly-dressed, her short hair permed and well-brushed, and despite the years, her beauty undiminished. At work, she highlighted her femaleness, speaking softly, wearing bright sarees and lipstick, and always carrying a handbag with all the essentials, including her detailed address book. She, at the same time, was capable of going toe-to-toe with anyone in order to achieve a task she had been assigned to do.
What I want to emphasize is the other side of her, a side which her nieces and nephews got to know. So let me start by saying that I loved her and will continue to love her. Indeed, I adored my loku nanda. I am the daughter of her panditha malli and she and my father were very close from childhood. In a sense, my father and she were each others best friends.
My earliest memory of my loku nanda was her smile; her kind, compassionate, gentle, twinkling-eyed smile. That was on a trip to Yala, one which most likely she organized. And in those trips, I recall that loku nanda had a number of sayings, the most persistent was lack of communication when trips in different vehicles ended up with one vehicle becoming lost. She was a stickler about starting on time and working for a purpose. There were other sayings that often sent usher nephews and niecesto silent but respectful merriment.
What needs to be highlighted in this brief note is that, despite all her accomplishments, she was not a one-dimensional person. She was not all about work. She, like all her brothers and sisters, could sew and cook anything from pol sambol to making biriyani from scratch. She had a phenomenal memory which she made good use of but was not serious all the time. Her jokes were many and her laughter was rich. I recall her singing songs from the 1950s and 1960s, where her sisters, brothers, and even in-laws would all joined in. She lived her life in Colombo but was a village-girl at heart, from the food she loved to eat to her understanding of the challenges faced by ordinary people. I recall during the 1987-1990 period, when shops were closed and people were scared, she and Loku Mama welcomed visitors with a large table full of food and kindness. In one instance, a couple had come from afar to visit a relative at General hospital and they came to her home to pay a visit. While entertaining them, she gently questioned them as to what they had eaten prior to travelling to Colombo and what was needed from the patient in the hospital. That couple left having had a meal and with a packet of milk and sugar for their relative at the hospital. She was just that kind of person.
She was a remarkable person because she achieved all that she had while being the mother of three wonderful childrenVidya, Haran, and Miuruwho themselves made her proud with their own achievements and lives. Her work ethic was astounding. She would get up at 5 am and write, by hand, an article, a story, or an editorial. But I think the most significant thing I learnt was that while it is important to have the drive and the determination to succeed, it must be coupled with compassion and kindness. She wanted all of us to nurture our natural abilities instead of becoming someone we were not. She always encouraged usher children, grandchildren and nieces and nephews and their childrento be close as a family unit even when some lived abroad. She was proud of achievements of her own sisters and brothers, their children and even their grandchildren and was equally upset if any tragedy befell them. She became the rock then, her shoulders strong enough to carry the sorrow.
These memories, which made loku nanda so wonderful, will remain with me forever.

Avant Garde Captain before special medical team
Galle High Court Judge M.U. Gunawardana directed the Galle HQI to produce Ukrainian Captain Gennady Gavrilov of the vessel MV Avant Garde before a board of medical doctors of the Galle Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and get a medical report on his cardiac health and submit it to courts.
Captain Gennady Gavrilov (49) was arrested on June 23 last year by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) on charges of illegally possessing and importing firearms and explosives to Sri Lanka. Subsequently, he was remanded in the Galle prison and after nine-month detention, released on strict bail conditions.
Accordingly, he was released on a Rs. 5 million cash bail and further ordered to report twice a week to Galle Police and not to go out of the Galle district.
The High Court Judge issued the directive on consideration of an appeal submitted by the Ukranian captain seeking revision of his bail conditions enabling him to fly to his country to undergo a surgery for a heart disease.
The petitioners lawyer making submission before courts stated that as the suspect was suffering from a heart disease he needed to go to his country to undergo a surgery and to get mediation for his ailing mother and mother-in-law.
As he could not visit his country and see his family members for long, his heart ailment had been aggravated. He needs to leave for his country to go through a surgery. He promises to return after the surgery. He pleads for a revision of the bail condition that prohibits him from leaving Sri Lanka, the lawyer for the suspect petitioner further submitted.
The State Counsel pointed out that already his strict bail conditions were revised on his request and there was no satisfactory assurance on his return to Sri Lanka after undergoing the heart operation.
The State Counsel for prosecution said he needed further clarifications on eight specific matters regarding the medical report on his health issued by the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and he opposed the petitioners pleadings.
The High Court Judge ordered the Galle HQI to produce the suspect before a medical team of the Karapitiya Teaching Hospital with specific recommendations on the following: 1. Is it essential for the suspect to undergo a heart operation II. Are there an alternative remedial actions for his ailment If so, what are they III.
If a heart surgery is obligatory, what type of a surgery should it be 1V. How long will it take for his complete recovery after the operation V. Is it required for him to be hospitalised after undergoing the surgery V1. Whether his family members seek any assistance following his anticipated surgery V11. How long will the suspect take to appear in courts after undergoing the cardiac surgery V11. After how long does the suspect expect to bring his family members to Sri Lanka if they possess valid passports
Th Judge further ordered the Galle HQI to refer his order to the Hospital Director on production of the suspect before a medical team.
The suspect was further ordered to inform court that how soon he expects to bring his family members to Sri Lanka as the authorities could issue the respective Visas for them provided they have valid passports. A.P.G. Sarathchandra appeared for the suspect petitioner, while State Counsel Kanishka Rajakaruna appeared for the prosecution. The High Court Judge fixed the hearing for October 23.

BBDO Lanka wins Bronze at 2017 Tangrams Effectiveness Awards
BBDO Lanka was awarded a Bronze for Effectiveness at the 2017 Tangrams Effectiveness Awards held at Spikes Asia Festival recently at Suntec Singapore.
Asia Pacific's premier awards honouring outstanding marketing strategies that deliver real business results, the Tangrams Effectiveness Awards was held at the end of the first day of Spikes Asia 2017 in Singapore.
BBDO Lanka, together with BBDO Singapore, took home the award for their work for Anchor in Sri Lanka under the Marketing Campaign for National Brand Development category.
Said BBDO Lanka Managing Director Santosh Menon, The Tangrams champion work that drive businesses forward through their insights and innovative marketing strategies that produce solid results. The jury identifies the most thought provoking work that genuinely and measurably demonstrates how it engages consumers. We are delighted to have been honoured with this prestigious award for our first ever entry.
BBDO Lanka and BBDO Singapore were recognised for their No Excuses campaign launched in August 2016 for Sri Lanka's leading milk powder brand Anchor. The addition of the BBDO Singapore team brought in new perspectives and the vision for Anchor as a champion of human potential bringing Sri Lanka together was articulated with the line Goodness Feeds Greatness'.
Research showed that whilst Sri Lankans were genuinely enthused about opportunities available to them in myriad avenues, they were nevertheless hesitant to make the first move. And thus the No Excuses campaign was born, to spark this important conversation and to inspire people to reach within themselves to unleash their latent potential.
Said Menon, BBDO Lanka combined with BBDO Singapore to bring the full prowess of the BBDO network to the fore for Anchor in Sri Lanka. We are proud to win this Tangram for Sri Lanka and to do work, for the brand, that is proven to work.
Over the years, we've been named Effies Agency of the year Sri Lanka in 2015 and Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine's Rest of South Asia Creative Agency of the Year - Silver in 2012 and Bronze in 2015. This comes from our passion for creativity that we utilise to create work that works for our clients and their brands. This award in particular gives us great satisfaction and pleasure because not only did we compete with the best in Sri Lanka but our case for Sri Lanka stands out among the best in the Asia-Pacific region."
Meanwhile Clemenger BBDO Melbourne, Australia, took home three coveted Agency of the Year trophies for Effectiveness, Media Strategy and Digital Strategy for being the best performing individual agency office in each award section. BBDO Worldwide was recognised as Tangrams Network of the Year.

Billion dollar business opportunity in power sector - Deputy Minister
In the next five years, investment opportunities would be offered to the private sector for 1,000 MW of wind power electricity generation in the country, affirmed Ajith P Perera, Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy, addressing the audience at the launch of Build SL Housing and Construction Expo 2018, held in Colombo, last Thursday.
He urged Sri Lankan entrepreneurs to make most of this zero corruption billion dollar business opportunity offered to them by the government.
He also asserted that no unsolicited proposes will be accepted again by the government to obtain electricity from anyone. A firm decision has also be taken to convert diesel and other electricity power plants by next year into Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants and measures will be finalized to set up a 300 MW electricity plant this month, which will add 300 MW to the national grid by 2019.
Furthermore, the Ceylon Electricity Board will enter into a public-private partnership (PPP) with other parties to build two 500 MW LNG power plants in the near future, he said.
Although the best renewable energy source was water, it was not possible to commence any electricity projects using water as all water sources have been exhausted by now. The only other renewable energy sources available which could be used to generate electricity in an affordable manner were wind and solar, the minister pointed out.
Today, 128 MW of electricity generated by wind power is added to the national grid. The minister however said that since his government came into power, a firm decision had been taken that no wind or solar power plant will be commissioned on permits or accepted as unsolicited proposals. A transparent tender procedure will be followed, he assured.
In the coming few months, tenders will be called for four projects in Pooneryn for wind power generation and four opportunities will be opened in the form of a 100 MW, a 50MW, and two 10 MW projects, for which local entrepreneurs could bid.
He said the Mannar solar power complex too which will come up with aid from the Asian Development Bank will take ground with a 100 MW plant. He said renowned foreign companies have told him that the best wind power generating area in the world is situated in the offshore seas in the North of Sri Lanka.
The deputy Minister urged local investors to get ready and grab these opportunities insisting that they need not go searching for land because land too would be provided by the government.
Perera also said they targeted to obtain 100 MW within two years from rooftop solar and by now they have been able to add 74 MW to the national grid and by December 31 they will be able add 100 MW to the system which is a US$ 100 million business. Deputy Minister Perera also said they targeted to fit rooftop solar units on one million Sri Lankan houses out of the total 5 million very soon.
The deputy minister said among their plans were a 100 MW solar power plant in Siyambalanduwa, 800 MW hybrid plant in Pooneryn and a one MW into 60 projects throughout Sri Lanka. He said with all the projects the government was able to lower the purchasing rate of one solar power unit from Rs 23.10 to Rs. 17.01.
He said they they commenced tendering for 10 MW power plants and the first tender for 10 MW two weeks ago in Batticaloa had received a solar power unit price of Rs 11.79, a 50 percent reduction.
The minister said they would be shortly starting another one MW into 90 projects and urged entrepreneurs not to go behind permits as they have no value at all.

Breaking through barriers on a road to empowerment
Womens empowerment' is a phrase oft-repeated across the world and specifically in South Asia, where there is growing recognition that greater female participation in economic activities is vital for sustainable development and social justice. Yet, South Asian women still face significant institutional and cultural barriers when attempting to access such opportunities.
On Tuesday, at the Jetwing Colombo Seven hotel in Cinnamon Gardens, a conference was held, fittingly titled, 'Reimagining Womens Empowerment in South Asia,' which gathered representatives from Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepalas well as the United States, Canada, and Germanyin an attempt to promote a regional dialogue between parliamentarians, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners.
The goal To identify clear and actionable evidence-based policy pathways that will enable womens economic empowerment. Sponsored by the Urban Institute, the International Centre for Ethnic Studies, and the Canadian Governments International Development Research Centre, the event included a series of expert panels and country-specific working sessions, as well as remarks by Canadian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka David McKinnon, Sri Lankan Constitutional Council Member Radhika Coomaraswamy and National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
The conference was a capstone to the 'GrOW' programme, which stands for Growth and Economic Opportunities for Women. For five years, researchers in more than 50 countries worked to strengthen the evidence base linking economic growth and gender equality. Now entering its final year, researchers are trying to disseminate their findings so they are used by local policymakers.
Unfair expectations
A woman running her own tailoring business.
Good research is absolutely critical in finding policy gaps that exist, said High Commissioner David McKinnon, in his opening remarks. He emphasized his countrys commitment to supporting gender equality in international development.
The first panel of the day, moderated by Urban Institute Center Director Elizabeth Peters, was titled, 'Impact of Economic Empowerment on Economic Growth and Welfare: South Asian Perspectives.' Its aim was to foster an understanding of the basics of why and how gender equality is fundamental to the transformation of societies in order to achieve greater social and economic well-being, human rights, and social justice.
The panelists began by addressing a problem particularly apparent in South Asia: that even as the educational gap between men and women is closing, womens participation in the labour force is not catching up. We are trying to understand what affects womens lives in these markets, said Rohini Somanathan, a Professor of Economics at the Delhi School of Economics.
Minister Harsha de Silva, in remarks delivered to a crowded room, focused on how local, cultural and religious practices and beliefs may be a reason for womens low participation in the labour force. He informed the audience that while 96 percent of Sri Lankan women are literatean impressive number not just for South Asia, but for the worldonly 36 percent are in the labour force. He also referenced unpaid labour by womenincluding household work, which is twice as much for women as men and child care, which is four times as much. There seem to be barriers that restrict womens agency, he said.
He named a few of those barriers: harassment on public transportation and in workplaces and unfair expectations of disproportionate domestic work. Very often, women shoulder the double burden of care as they provide care for the elderly as well as children, he said.
In addition, harassment in public transport has been coming up over and over and over as a reason women dont want to go to work in those packed buses and trains, he said. He said it was an embarrassing situation.
De Silva said people must work these prejudices out internally and he praised the Governments recent initiative to establish a 25 percent quota for women in local elections.
Culture as main barrier to workforce entry
Other GrOW researchers also pointed to culture as a main barrier to workforce participation. Speaking after De Silva, Mona Sherpa, Deputy Country Director at HELVETAS Swiss Interco-operation in Nepal, said progress could not be made without attacking these pervasive gender norms. If this traditional role is not managed, no amount of development will be enough to bridge the gap, she said.
Case studies from Pakistan emphasized how educational achievement and job training does not always translate into workforce participation. Feyza Bhatti, a lead researcher with GrOW, said that in her study, women realised their skills were not converting into market acceptance. As an intervention, her team designed a market linkages programme to make sure women were trained for specific job placements.
Charles Cadwell, from the Urban Institute in Pakistan, said a study had found that violence and the fear of violence, were significant barriers to women entering the workplace. We strongly recommend increasing surveillance and safety measures and training of public transport personnel to be vigilant about womens safety, he said.
To close off the day, event participants broke out into country-specific working groups. Leading the Sri Lankan working group was Ramani Gunatilaka, a Research Associate at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies, Sri Lanka. Each countrys working group was tasked with determining two issues whichif solvedwould significantly increase the potential for empowerment of women in the respective countries.
The Sri Lankan working group discussed an array of issues and determined unanimously to select issues that didnt just impact the country as a whole, but the oft-disadvantaged north and east too. With this in mind, the leaders of the group ended up selecting the transformation of educationboth specific policies as well as norms and stereotypes enforced in a childs educational careeras the issue to focus on.
But other issues discussed in the working group have much relevance to the gender conversation too. There were suggestions to zero in on workplace sexual harassment by ensuring there are modes which allow women to report it safely and without fear of retribution. There were suggestions to create a legislative framework for flexi-hour workthat is, work that is less traditional, not done in an office full-time, but either part-time, from home, or a mix of the two. There were suggestions to create a better path to self-sufficient livelihoods for women whove been pushed by varying agents into the agricultural field, which participants pointed out often has low returns, is still brawn-based and less sympathetic to the female body, and is quite risky today given the ebbs and flows of climate change.
Afterward, each country presented their issues. Notably, representatives of India focused on ensuring direct investment in programmes working toward womens empowerment, representatives of Bangladesh focused on preventing child marriage, representatives of Pakistan focused on stopping domestic violence and gender-based violence more generally, and representatives of Nepal focused on institutionalizing community childcare centers.
Leaving the conference after nearly nine hours of intense discussion, thought, and determining next steps, the mostly female participants felt satisfied with the day. And as more than one told me while walking out the door, theyre excited to get back to work.
Women and men as equals in the workplace

Certain GMOA doctors, dons disrupting medical students future: Kiriella
A few doctors holding office in the GMOA have teamed up with certain university dons to disrupt the future of medical students by inducing them to protest and demonstrate. Their parents should understand this reality, Leader of the House and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was addressing a press conference held at his Kandy Heerassagala residence on October 15.
These groups are ruining the future prospects of medical students and the negative repercussions of the sinful act of these students and dons they will feel within the next few years, he said.
Kiriella said the policy of the Government was to strengthen free education while stabilising private education because students passing the O/L should have the opportunity to pursue higher education within the country even by paying for it.
These facilities were available in all countries and the GMOA and the striking students were under the misconception that education policy should be fashioned according to their behest, he said.
The Minister said the court case over the SAITM was billed to be heard daily to a finish in November within three days. The Government was prepared to go by the court verdict and act accordingly, he said.
Nearly 300 go abroad annually to obtain medical degrees and it cost the country nearly Rs. 7,000 billion in foreign exchange. The country would be able to save that amount by setting up a private medical college locally, the Minister said.
He said the anti-SAITM campaign definitely had political overtones. Defeated political elements were taking cover under this campaign to build public opinion against the Government.
The masses are completely aware of their underlying intentions because the SAITM was started during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, the Minister said.

[CITIZENS' Mail - (16-10-2017)]
Its not that we use technology, we live it!
With the advancement in technology like internet, computers and tablets changing the dynamics of the print industry tremendously, newspaper, magazine and book circulation has reached its lowest.
The print industry is expected to lose 25% of its jobs over the next few years. The print industry is drastically declining because the Internet has, and continues, to shape the way we communicate.
The future of print is not very bright in my opinion. I do not believe that the print medium will be a part of the future because there will be no need for anything printed.
While the print industry is suffering, it is predicted that applications like ebooks, ibooks and audio books are expected to increase in a vast range. In a few years, newspapers, books and advertisements will all be created and made only for online.
Therefore, future technology should be more compatible with peoples needs. Tablets should be neon sized, light and slick, interactive and portable. Users should be able to explore endless possibilities from writing word documents to creating and designing websites. The future tablets should be able to bend, fold and roll while giving the user the experience of reading a book or a magazine.
Prospective tablets should allow users to browse the web, take pictures, upload and watch videos. Upcoming tablets should not take away people interacting with each other but it should enhance peoples interaction globally.
The future holds a lot of promise for auto voice translating and interpreting, which will remove any language barriers. The future progression in technology will change the dynamic of communication all across the world, in the classroom, the workplace and the public sphere.
It is not known what the future may hold for the advancement communication technology, but it is not farfetched to say that we may one day be able to send emails with our own thought or brainwaves wherever we roam.

 Sections 146, 147 and 148 of the principal enactment are hereby repealed.
It is important to note that the pre-trial process is a novel feature introduced by the Amendment, which can expedite the trial procedure.

 one of several actions to be tried and other actions to be stayed to abide by the result, with the consent of the parties.
However, in the above circumstances, on the application of any party the court shall have power to try one of the other actions so stayed where the selected action fails to be a real trial of the issues involved.
9. Affidavit evidence
Under the new Act, with the insertion of Section 151A provisions have been set out for Affidavit evidence, accordingly;

De Kock, Amla trump Mushfiqur century
Kimberley: Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla shared a record partnership as South Africa cruised to a ruthless ten-wicket win in the first one-day international against Bangladesh at the Diamond Oval on Sunday.
De Kock (168 not out) and Amla (110 not out) put on an unbeaten 282 to overhaul Bangladeshs 278 for seven with 7.1 overs to spare.
The South African openers overshadowed the feat of Mushfiqur Rahim, whose 110 not out was the first century by a Bangladesh batsman against South Africa in any international match. Bangladeshs total was their highest in one-day games against South Africa.
Mushfiqurs innings came with a price. He appeared to suffer a hamstring injury and he watched the De Kock-Amla partnership from the players balcony, adding to injuries which kept two other key players, Tamim Iqbal (thigh) and Mustafizur Rahman (ankle) out of the match.
We have to keep fighting, said Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza about the injuries. These things happen in cricket. You cant blame anything.
Mashrafe said that although Bangladesh had posted a good total, we knew we had to take wickets. If you can stop the runs at both ends the pressure will bring wickets. But we couldnt apply pressure.
South African captain Faf du Plessis praised what he described as another dominating performance. As a team you want to be ruthless. Today was a very, very good example of that. When youre bossing the game and you are 150 for no wicket its easy to throw wickets away, but the guys are hungry to put in massive performances.
De Kock made his runs off 145 balls with 21 fours and two sixes. Amla had less of the strike, facing 112 balls and hitting eight fours. Their partnership was the highest for any wicket for South Africa and the joint sixth highest in all one-day internationals.
Mushfiqurs fifth one-day century was greeted with rapturous applause by hundreds of Bangladeshi supporters. He made his runs off 116 balls with 11 fours and two sixes. He shared successive partnerships of 59 with Shakib Al Hasan, 69 with Mahmudullah and 42 with Sabbir Rahman for the third, fourth and fifth wickets. Shakib made a quiet return after resting during a two-match Test series in which Bangladesh were heavily defeated. He made 29 and conceded 48 runs in eight overs. But he became only the fifth player to complete the one-day international double of 5000 runs and 200 wickets. Kagiso Rabada spearheaded South Africas bowling attack, taking four for 43. AFP

Digital disruption: IQ leads the charge in Sri Lanka
For the first time in Sri Lanka, Innovation Quotient (IQ) is bridging the gap between human insight, applied creativity and technical capability. And its bringing these solutions to top corporates, businesses and start-ups around the country.
Sri Lankas digital transformation is imminent and IQ is leading the charge as the only tech-creative-consultancy hybrid to offer design thinking and innovation focused on digital transformation to tackle complex business issues.
IQs portfolio covers digital transformation, tech solutions, rapid prototyping, digital marketing, campaign management, and also includes a media lab.
In 2013, Nadira Abdul Cader and Irfan Ahmed led a founding team consisting of tech and communications veterans such as Johan Latiff, Shafraz Faleel and Arshad Ahamed alongside marketers and innovators to venture into a space unchartered in Colombo. The IQ team has since grown to include a diverse set of 40+ creatives, tech specialists, strategists and managers, all coming under the umbrella of the Aberdeen Holdings Group in a short span of four years.
IQ has grown from a start-up making waves with its unusual business model to a budding organisation led by a unified vision, brave clients, growth hacking, lean methods and some luck, says Director, Nadira Abdul Cader. We havent been talking about the work we do because weve been so focused on doing it right. Our team prefers to let the work speak for itself and it does so loud and clear.
Business has certainly kept them busy - currently, the IQ team is working on three apps, two disruptive platforms, managing over 10 different social media communities that engage an audience of over 300,000 followers for leading brands, and consulting multiple clients on digital innovation projects.
They are also focused on getting the metrics right. IQ has formulated a Digital Readiness Index that uses the globally coveted Deloitte Digital Maturity Test, Aark Digital Maturity Assessment and Third Sector Digital Maturity Index as a base, mapping against the teams expertise on disrupting digital space to assess a participant organizations digital readiness in the Sri Lankan context.
Via a short 10 minute test available online (at www.IQ.lk), the participant company is assessed under five pillars - strategy and leadership, customer engagement, organization, talent and digital operations. A full report is generated at the end of the assessment.
IQ exists for one thing-bridging the gap between creativity, technology and strategy, says CEO Irfan Ahmed. Were moving into a world where you either disrupt, or you are disrupted. Just look at all the start-up unicorns making headlines. Theyve all disrupted their industries and the existing players have had to face rapidly changing market realities because of this. You can see the same happening in Sri Lanka, be it in taxi hailing or entertainment. Were leading Sri Lankas imminent digital transformation by helping our clients be digitally ready.
IQs team is diverse. An eclectic mix of engineers, animators, project managers, art directors, digital marketers, software developers, analysts and data scientists make up an ecosystem that thrives on disruptive solutions to everyday business challenges, with the focus on a digital future.
Its exciting, says Johann Latiff, Chief Design Officer. We work with brave brands that have accepted that digital transformation is inevitable. Because of that, theyre ahead of the curve already. Theyre making strides into markets that were previously inaccessible, and meeting consumer needs in creative ways. Adding that In a dynamic and constantly turbulent digital landscape, spearheading the digital transformation of Sri Lankan brands while doing what we love is what drives us and keeps us on our toes.

Dirijaya Prathibha 2017 for a disable friendly environment
Following the first ever and successful Dirijaya Prathibha variety show which was initiated in 2013, the unique event has been scheduled to make a comeback with Dirijaya Prathibha 2017  The Journey Continues...
The event will take place on October 21 at the Nelum Pokuna and is being organized by the Enable the Disabled Foundation which happens to be the CSR arm of The Management Club, a body of Professional Managers. Enable the Disabled is registered with the Social Services Ministry and is committed to promoting a disable friendly environment in Sri Lanka. Chief Guest at the event will be the Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister, Faizer Musthapha under whose Ministry childrens parks are being managed.
Dirijaya Prathibha is a unique event where popular artists from the local music and drama scene will perform alongside children and adults with disabilities who are talented but who are still relatively unknown or recognized in the country. The stage will transform itself as the ideal platform for these amazing individuals and help them to showcase their talents and show that they need to be recognized instead of being cocooned and shunned within a segregated society.
The event agenda will include segments conducted by over 70 performers amidst the presence of an audience of over 1000. Enable the Disabled Foundation Brand Ambassador is popular music artist, Dushyanth Weeraman who is set to perform at the event and will be joined by the likes of performing artists such as Bhathiya and Santhush, Mariazelle Goonatilleke, Rukshan Perera, Lahiru Perera, Kingsouth, Sahan Ranwala, Stephanie Siriwardhana and Imani Perera.
Children and individuals with disabilities will also be set to showcase their performances and the audience will witness disabled children and adults from places such as the School for the Deaf, School for the Blind, ACT4, Diri Daru Piyasa, children from the Lyceum International School, Chitra Lane School and the Wheel Chair Dance Sport Association.
The show will not only help showcase the talents of children and adults with disabilities but will also help to build awareness and encourage the public to include persons with disabilities in mainstream economic and social activities as well.
Commenting on the upcoming event, Project Co-Chairperson, Jazaya Hassendeen said, There are only a few restrictions on accessing the tools of art. However, musical instruments, paintbrushes, pencils or video cameras are fairly adaptable. Since art is infinite and unconditional, people with disabilities are free to express themselves without physical, social or attitudinal barriers.
She also explained that if this value is inculcated in these children from a very young age it will then be carried to adulthood and the next generation will be different to what they are today. Social and economic inclusion is something that children and adults with disabilities have to advocate or fight for today, she acknowledged. The proceeds of the event will be utilized towards funding the project Play for All initiated by the Foundation where existing childrens parks will gradually be upgraded to include equipment that would also cater to children with disabilities. A location has been identified in Colombo to initiate the first of such parks in the near future.

Face confident Pakistan in second ODI today : Sri Lanka has worst ODI record with unsettled batting order
ABU DHABI, Sunday: Sri Lanka already with the worst win-loss ratio record for a Test nation in a calendar year has a tough task ahead of them to break the winless run of eight consecutive defeats when they take on Champions Trophy champions Pakistan in the second ODI at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here on Monday.
Sri Lankas defeat at the hands of Pakistan in the first ODI played at Dubai on Friday has stretched their losses for the calendar year to 17 out of 22 matches and given them a win-loss ratio of 0.235 which according to Cricinfo stats is the worst by any Test team.
None of the top Test nations have had such a poor record, in terms of win-loss ratio in any calendar year in which they have played 20 or more ODIs, the previous worst was West Indies with 0.266 (won 4, lost 15) in 2009.
Sri Lankas worst year before this was in 1999, when they won 12 and lost 20.
Amongst Sri Lankas worst defeats this year are a shocking 3-2 series loss to Zimbabwe and a drawn series against Bangladesh both at home and 5-0 drubbings at the hands of South Africa and India.
Sri Lankas troubles as pointed out by head coach Nic Pothas is in their top order batting which has not delivered the required runs as expected with the top six batters contributing just 96 runs with one of them going onto score 53 in the first ODI at Dubai which they lost by 83 runs.
The last few seasons this has happened. We need big knocks and if you need big totals someone has to go onto post a big total. Babar Azam got a hundred for Pakistan and they got close to 300. In ODIs, one batsman needs to score big and that is the only way forward to post decent totals, said Sri Lanka skipper Upul Tharanga.
Since 2016 we have not played well. We have not been consistent. A lot of things changed. Players were changed and we had injuries. But still I dont think we played to our potential. We play one game well and then we fail to live upto expectations. We beat India in England in June but since then we have struggled due to lack of consistency, he said.
Various issues have prevented Sri Lanka from having a set batting order since the departure of their two batting legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene (who held onto the no. 3 and 4 positions for years). For instance when Niroshan Dickwella and Danushka Gunathilaka were beginning to pair off well together as openers from the Champions Trophy the latter got hauled up on disciplinary grounds and was banned for six one-day games, thus breaking the opening partnership that was beginning to build. That forced the team management and selectors to opt for skipper Upul Tharanga who had been batting in the middle order to promote himself as Dickwellas partner.
Also the no. 3 and 4 positions are not settled yet with various players being tried out at different times.
Mendis has occupied the no. 3 slot since the South African series from the beginning of the year until he was rested for the final match of the Indian series and Dilshan Munaweera given that slot. On Friday Mendis on his return was pushed to bat at no. 5 against Pakistan - a position regularly occupied by Dinesh Chandimal who was surprisingly sent ahead of Mendis at no. 3.
Tharanga has occupied the no. 4 spot since the Zimbabwe series and moved as opener in Sri Lankas last two ODIs against India and Pakistan. These few examples of players being moved around as if in a game of musical chairs has certainly not helped Sri Lankas batting woes. In their last seven ODIs their highest total has been 238 which is hardly a total to be in todays context when teams are running up scores in excess of 300.
Defending the move to send Chandimal ahead of Mendis, Tharanga said, Chandimal came to bat at three. He had a very good Test series. Mendis was not amongst the runs. What we wanted was since Chandi was in good nick to give him a go. We wanted Kusal to go at five and gain some confidence. That didnt work for us. Apart from two or three players others are in their right positions. We need to give one player a long run in one position.
This series when it started we spoke about batting because it has let us down over the last few series. We tried to tell the players what their role is. All the players are aware of their roles. I hope from tomorrow onwards we will come up with good batting efforts, he said. Pakistan with no such issues in their camp are a confident lot and looking forward to winning the series if the way they played in the first ODI is to be used as a paradigm to the form they are in.
There are a few things to address. We missed a few things. The first ten overs we didnt take singles so its important to address that but otherwise the teams overall performance was good, said Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed.
Thanks to God we did well in the first ODI. We played well and the team gave an overall performance, so the expectations are high for an important second game. We have done good preparations so its an important match. We will do our best to take it one by one and win the next. Our team will be the same, he said.

Family politics
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha certainly has put the cat among the pigeons. He, no doubt, is not going to endear himself to those politicians who have firmly set their minds on making a career in politics for their wives, sons and daughters. He has told an English daily that only one member of a family will henceforth be permitted to contest elections for parliament, provincial councils or local bodies, under the new electoral system. He says the government did not intend to give nominations to the wives and daughters of government ministers and other political strongmen. Are we going to see the end of the Rajapaksa lineage in politics Presently there are three Rajapaksas in parliament. There is also another father son combination in the House.
It is not clear if the Minister's proclamation will be made into law, or if it was the government party which will be enforcing this rule and the Opposition will be free to nominate their kith and kin. It is also not known if the minister's declaration can be challenged in a court of law, based on the premise that it is a fundamental right for an individual to seek elected office, similar to the exercise of the franchise.
But the minister's stand, no doubt, will have many siding with him on the issue of politicians promoting their next of kin to follow in their footsteps, to make a career in politics. A Commission appointed by the late President Premadasa, in the aftermath of the second JVP uprising, among other things, noted that youth frustration stemmed from the fact that opportunities were denied to them to enter the political mainstream due to politicians in power ladling the gravy for themselves and their kith and kin who were holding political office. This was amply reflected in the first election held to the provincial councils in 1988 where the candidates were virtually a second eleven of the parliament team, where the nomination lists were packed with the sons, daughters and wives of sitting MPs. This, needless to say, deprived the more deserving and the marginalised from entering politics and hold elected office. The same situation obtains in the present day as well, with the provincial councils made a virtual finishing school for the sons and daughters of politicians to enter parliament.
The legislature itself mirrors this sad state of affairs, with father, son and brother combinations holding sway, sharing and enjoying all the perks and privileges. Of course, one could argue that it is unfair to deny the offspring or a sibling of a politician to enter parliament, merely due to the blood connection. There, in fact, have been many such combinations in parliament even in the past, which were not frowned upon by the public. There were, indeed, political families, the members of whose natural succession was only to be expected. Nobody would have questioned the inherent right of the Senanayakes and the Bandaranaikes to follow in the footsteps of their illustrious forbears. Indeed Sri Lanka would not have produced the first woman Prime Minister in the world had Sirima Bandaranaike not succeeded her slain husband to the throne. Nor, for that matter, the first woman President of Sri Lanka had Chandrika not followed the family tradition. Anura Bandaranaike was a politician in his own right even without the family antecedents. His contribution as a young parliamentarian was enormous, his oratory unique, replete with wit and humour, that adorned the volumes of the Hanzard. These political families came to serve the people with a genuine intent and not to feather their nests, since as is well known, they were endowed with sufficient wealth and riches.
However, regrettably, politics is today a business and a very lucrative one at that, drawing more and more members of the family like bees to the pot of honey. Hence the minister's standpoint in blocking family members entering the legislature would be appreciated by all right thinking people. As it is, the public are already burned by having to maintain one member of a family who is a MP or a minister. They would not look forward to shouldering the burden of more members of the same family.
Not just the immediate family. Minister Mustapha should also ensure that the rule applies even to relatives, near or distant, of a minister or MP. For, it will have the same effect as having a son or daughter in parliament, though to a lesser degree. Measures should also be taken to do away with the current practise of packing the provincial councils with MPs kith and kin. As already mentioned, it is but an automatic stepping stone to parliament. What is more, they have an unfair advantage over the rest due to the power and influence of their parents who are ministers or MPs. Minister Mustapha should be commended for bringing this suggestion, although he won't be popular with many parliamentarians. It is bad enough having to endure the high jinx of our politicians inside parliament without adding to babel by inducting the juniors too into the House.

It was the 24th meeting in a final between the worlds top two, and with the roof again closed because of rain in Shanghai, Federer soon built a 4-2 lead.
There was little between them in the early exchanges of the second set until the pivotal fifth game.
Nadal, winner of the US Open and China Open, saved the first break point but could not survive the second as Federer surged to a second Shanghai Masters crown.
Federer is now the only man who can deny Nadal the number one ranking at the end of the year, but the Swiss said the ATP Finals at Londons 02 Arena next month was his main focus.
Ill go home and we will work out where I play next, Basel, Paris, one of those or none, before I go to London, which is my priority, said Federer.
World number one I dont think will happen but if I play like this maybe Ill get close, who knows

Minister Samaraweera underscored the importance of finding financing for development initiatives. He further reiterated that the continued engagement of the Group on inclusive growth and productivity improvement to create employment opportunities will be one of the key priorities. Financing for development remains an urgent priority. Finding ways and means to fulfill this need is another key area that we must focus on at various fora.

Groomed for success
Not only was she the first Sri Lankan contestant to represent Sri Lanka at the Mrs Universe pageant but she managed to make her mark at the event as well and bring home the mini title of Woman Mrs Universe Honesty. Apart from that multi talented Thrikala Dharani has even been approached by Victorias Secret, UK. All this and more she has achieved with her supportive husband Enoke Perera by her side cheering her along from the ramp to uploading pictures of her delicious food onto his Facebook account.
In a few words
Thrikala is very loving, caring and objective. She has a lot of confidence. She is also very honourable.She went to Thakshila Central College, Horana. She is qualified in many different sectors. She is one of the youngest people to get a Visharada degree in music in Sri Lanka. She got her degree when she was 16. She can play pretty much any musical instrument except the flute. She has undergone training and is a qualified aircraft maintenance technician. She is also a qualified cabin crew member. We have a two year old daughter, Saleen, so now Thrikala is also qualified as a mother!
Music runs in the family
Thrikala comes from a family which is deeply rooted in music. Her parents, Ajith and Samantha Kalubowila, are both musicians. They have their own music institute. Her elder sister, Thanu, is a lawyer. Her brother, Ridma, is still engaged in studies. They have all got musical names. Thrikala means three arts, Thanu means melody and Ridma means rhythm.
The meeting
Our meeting was coincidental. It took place four years ago. Thrikala called me to get some advice about joining SriLankan Airlines. I work as a pilot for Etihad Airways. Her parents were not fond of her joining the company so she was looking for other avenues of advice. Soon we were texting each other on WhatsApp and we found out that we have a lot of similarities. We realized that we were very compatible. So eventually I asked her out.
First date
One day when I was at my home in Pelawatte I got to know that Thrikala had dropped by Maharagama for some work. My best friend lives in Maharagama so I decided to tell her that I am heading off from there. My first glimpse of her was of her crossing the road and running towards me. Later I lied to her saying that I am driving towards Horana and dropped her in her home town.
Similar interests
I love cars and I would do anything for cars. Thrikala too had a passion for cars. We shared pictures of cars and she was spot on from the framework, paint job, trim and alloy wheels in the pictures of the cars she sent. She and I also love pizza and Thai food. We are into music too. I can drum and she plays almost anything. Everything about her from her passions to her personality captivated me. That made me decide that she is the one for me.
The marriage
We have been seeing each other for less than six months after we decided to tie the knot. By then we knew that we had to be together. I had to head off to Abu Dhabi because of my profession. So I decided that she had to be with me there. I asked her and everything happened spontaneously. We got married on January 23, 2015, at Kingsbury Hotel. Our daughter was born on February 2, 2016.
From marriage to Mrs Sri Lanka Universe
Trikalas father is very strict. Once she changed her hair colour and she was given 24 hours to change it back to the original colour! She wanted to compete for the Miss Sri Lanka pageant but he was not into that idea. However once she decided to take part in Mrs Sri Lanka for Mrs Universe he had no objections. He gave me a look saying that is your problem now.
I am comfortable to an extent of Thrikala taking part in the beauty and glamour scene. I have my limits too but most of the time I am very supportive towards her work. It is based on trust and I believe that everybody should be given an opportunity. Being in the field is time consuming as well.
I believe that it all comes down to the individual. If that person can manage their time, handle the pressure and the changes, I dont see a problem.
Winning a beauty pageant of this nature is her dream and I am happy to see her dream come true. I usually speak out when I am not comfortable with things and she has been understanding towards those matters. It is something to do with the understanding between both parties. If there is a breakdown in communication, then things are going to be difficult.
Thrikala showed me a USA beauty pageant and they were willing to absorb her as a representative of Sri Lanka but based in the US. It was complicated then because we just had the baby. Later when we returned to Colombo we heard about the Mrs Sri Lanka for Mrs Universe pageant. It was just a matter of her telling me about it and me giving it a nod.
She is a winner
Thrikala is very confident and she has got an extremely good personality. She is also very dedicated to whatever she takes up. I had a lot of faith in what she did. I was very confident that she had a very good chance of winning the Mrs Sri Lanka Universe 2017 title. Whenever I had an off day I would be there to cheer her along and people used to give me the thumbs up when they realized that she was my wife.
She won four mini pageants: Mrs Best Catwalk, Mrs Talent, Mrs Best Model and Mrs Popular. She did a fusion traditional and modern dance, played the tabla and sang raga for the talent competition. I made sure that I was there for that because she trained so hard for it.
Tough times
Thrikala had put on 25 kilos during pregnancy. She worked out, walked and planned her meals and got back to her normal weight before the pageant. She did not take any supplements or medication to lose weight.
She went on a high protein diet and lost five kilos when she was in South Africa taking part in the Mrs Universe competition. This was mainly to lose belly fat because they had to wear a bikini for the competition.
Favourite Mrs Universe moment
Thrikala did a fire eating dance called Gini Sisila for the Mrs Universe talent round in South Africa. Lalith Parakum choreographed it and trained her in less than 10 days. Everybody was cheering her. We have the video and I even watch it on some of my off days because I am truly fascinated about how she did it.
Biggest strength and biggest weakness
Thrikala is very determined. That is her greatest strength. She is also quite presentable. She always looks well groomed. I am very casual. I dress when I need to dress up. She is a sucker for fashion. The only thing I had to train her on was time management. If we had to attend a cocktail party at seven she would only be ready at eight. However now she has overcome that hurdle too.
Foodwise
Thrikala is an excellent cook. We are both vegetarians. I actually have a separate album on my Facebook account which is called Tikis Vegetarian Kitchen. The specialty about her dishes is that she garnishes them. They are like something out of a culinary magazine! She makes cauliflower dough to Cinnabon cinnamon rolls. Whenever she goes to a restaurant she chats with the chef and asks for the recipe to recreate the dish. I love her cauliflower dough pizzas. She loves Thai food and the sticky rice is her favourite.
Favourite pastimes
We live in Abu Dhabi so we usually head off to the race track or shopping mall. We love family outings. Our favourite holiday destination is Seychelles. We have not been to Switzerland and would love to go there.
Unfulfilled dreams
Thrikala has recorded a song called Kohe Hoo Nuba Innawa Athi. The melody is by Sanka Dineth and the lyrics are by Isuru Weerasinghemudali. She and Mr Sri Lanka 2016 Udaya Sri Bandara are featuring in the music video. She is hoping to release it at the end of the month. She wishes to do an album as well. Thrikalas dream is to win a Best Singer in a Motion Picture award. If she gets an offer for a challenging character in a movie which does not involve scenes like running around bushes holding somebodys hand,
then yes, I would encourage her to take up the role.

Guarding the Akropolis: Reading LYSISTRATA in the Age of Trump
Lysistratalysistrata is an old play. Written by Aristophanes and first performed in 411 BCE, the comedy centers on a group of women, led by the titular character, who have grown tired of losing their husbands and sons to the Peloponnesian War and have decided to do Something about it. Their plan is simple: deny their partners sex until the less-than-responsible male parties agree to a viable treaty.
Its also a funny play. The puns are excellent, even in translations (alas, I took Latin, not Greek). The discussions of boudoir wear and vicious erections remain bawdy and hilarious all of these centuries later. A foundational interpretation of the War of the Sexes, Lysistrata also remains one of the more clever, nuanced, and timeless ones.
Surface humor
Beneath the surface humor, though, is social commentary centuries ahead of its time.
Do I think Aristophanes was a feminist I do not. Yes, there are plenty of women who stepped outside of traditional roles back in the olden days (Artemisia I, Queen Boudicca, Deborah, Lady Fu Hao) and yes, the ladies do win the day at the end of the play, but, as mentioned previously, Lysistrata is a comedy and the role reversal is meant to entertain in the same way the fool entertained the king in the Middle Ages.
Theres authorial intent, though, and then theres acquired contextual relevance. Lysistrata, no matter what Aristophanes intended it to be, is a cutting commentary on gender politics and equality. It is particularly relevant at this moment because the Trump administration is systematically stripping women of our reproductive rights. Again, a council of old, white men seems to think they have the right to make such life-altering decisions for all women and as with the Peloponnesian War, that cannot stand.
What can we do
Like Lysistrata and her sisters, we can see these men (these men, not all men, chill fellas) for what they are and we can, and must, resist.
This isnt going to be an easy fight. It would be really nice if something worth doing was quick, simple, and clean, but that is rarely the case. Resistance is ugly and dirty and often involves doing things wed rather not do or not doing things wed like to do. For the Greek cohort this meant complete abstinence which, from the passage above, you can see almost cost the general her army. Like them, we may be shamed. We may be mocked and threatened.
Those of us who are introverts may have to stand up and scream. Those of us who prefer action may have to hold back, be patient. We may have to work late into the night after weve already worked full days, spend time away from our families. We will most certain have to shatter taboos surrounding appropriate public discourse. So be it. If we stick together, sisters, we can do anything from ending a war to taking our rights.
Ive said it. Youve said it. Lets say it all together now: eff the patriarchy. It has had its day and it is failing in every conceivable way. We Nasty Women need to take our rightful place at the head of this ship and help correct its course. Im not advocating voting for women because theyre women. What Im asking you to do is to consider candidates based on their platforms, ideas, and experience regardless of their genitalia. Dont be afraid of powerful, opinionated, intelligent women. Dont become so fixated on a single issue you lose sight of the larger picture. Investigate. Evaluate. Discern. Throw away stereotypes and cultural baggage and think. Then demand more.
Right to refuse
They will try to intimidate us into keeping silent. They will demand their right to free speech, their right to call us shrill. They will tell us to sit down, to disappear quietly into the spaces theyve delineated. It is our right to refuse. It is our right to answer back at whatever volume, and with whatever degree of vehemence we deem necessary to make ourselves heard. Claim what they would take and make it yours as Lysistrata did, as the women barricading the Akropolis did. They think they hold the power by virtue of history and gender norms and bluster. History is old and fragile and gender norms are eminently breakable. Bluster is empty air.
Reproductive choices
Lysistrata didnt want to be saved, nor do we. We are not fragile flowers. We do not need your protection, least of all from ourselves. The only people who should be permitted to regulate a bodys reproductive choices is the owner of that body. We are perfectly capable of making such decisions on our own with our brains which, shocker, are in exactly the same place as everyone elses.
You dont have the right to prevent us from having children. You dont have the right to tell us we must. You dont have the right to force us to keep a child conceived by rape. You damn sure dont have the right to allow give parental rights to rapists. Let me say it again: we. Dont. Need. You. To. Regulate. Our. Reproduction. We dont need you to regulate any other aspect of our health. We dont need you to regulate us. We dont need your help and we dont want your version of salvation. Take it somewhere else.
Im sure some of you are thinking, Wow, shes angry. Yeah. I am. I am very angry. Many people, both male and female, find female anger frightening. And maybe some of them should. Because in the words of the immortal Orlando Jones, Anger gets shit done.
Make all the noise you want, men of Athens and Sparta and Washington. Good luck with that.
Because we are Lysistrata. We are the women of Athens and Sparta and the United States.
And we will get. This. Shit. Done.

Harpic completes phase one in national sanitation drive
The first set of 100 toilets commissioned by the Ministry of City Planning and Water together with Harpic was completed recently, providing clean sanitation facilities to over 30 households and aschool in Katana.
In March, Harpic launched the HarpicSuwa Jana Meheyuma; Mission Wellbeing, in collaboration with the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply to elevate the status of hygiene across households in Sri Lanka.
The project sought to build 100 toilets in the Western province in the first phase, going up to 300 toilets across Sri Lanka at the completion of the project.
The students of David De Silva Vidyalaya in Peellawatta, Katunayake, with an 800-strong student population will also have access to a new washroom facility that promotes the concept of hygiene.
State Minister of City Planning and Water Supply, Sudarshani Fernandopulle, who has led the project since its inception said, This is an overlooked area in Sri Lankas development drive. I am confident that we will be able to achieve our target to build 300 toilets during the next few months and provide clean sanitation facilities for well over 1,000 people. It is estimated that nearly two percent of the population practice open defecation due to the lack of toilets, while a further two percent share a common toilet.
The Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply has identified the need for nearly 180,000 toilets across Sri Lanka.
Harpics current efforts to build toilets is only the first step of a much bigger national project that hopes to address Sri Lankas sanitation issues that go deeper than the unclean toilet we see on the surface.
Commenting on the progress of the project Sri Lanka Commercial Director for Reckitt Benckiser, Sinclair Cruise said, There is more that needs to be done across Sri Lanka to address the sanitation issue. This project is one of many initiatives we have undertaken in this area and we will continue to work on public spaces to improve the sanitation situation.

IMF, World Bank meet in Washington for annual meet
The annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were underway Saturday as policymakers from around the world gathered in Washington to discuss the most pressing issues facing the global economy.
The IMF and the World Bank are closely linked  so close that their headquarters are across the street. So what's the difference between the two The answer goes back seven decades. Both the IMF and the World Bank were conceived at the United Nations' Bretton Woods Conference in July 1944. Top economic minds from 44 countries gathered at a hotel in New Hampshire to come up with a new framework for the international monetary system. There was a general consensus that the old system of exchange rates and payments had failed, leading to the Great Depression, currency devaluations and the collapse of the gold standard.
"Economic cooperation was the main goal in everybody's mind when they started to plan out the system during World War II," said James Boughton, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation and former IMF historian. (CNBC)

Improving world economy still needs help from low rates: IMF
The world economy is the healthiest its been in years but could still use a little help from low-interest rates and higher government spending from countries that can afford it, the International Monetary Fund says.
There was a strong consensus that the global outlook is strengthening, said Agustin Carstens, governor of the Bank of Mexico and outgoing chair of the IMFs policy committee. This does not mean we are declaring victory just yet.
The 189-member IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank, wrapped up three days of meetings Saturday.
The IMF expects the global economy to grow 3.6 per cent this year, up from 3.2 per cent in 2016. And three-quarters of the global economy is growing, making this the broadest recovery in a decade.
But IMF and World Bank officials pointed to risks that could derail global growth. Geopolitical risks are rising, including a confrontation between the United States and North Korea over Pyongyangs nuclear weapons program. The income gap between rich and poor is growing, fueling political discontent with the free trade and global cooperation that the IMF and World Bank promote.
So in a communique Saturday, the IMFs policy committee called on world central banks to protect the fragile global recovery by keeping interest rates down in countries where inflation is too low and economies are performing below potential. (The Economic Times)

Language should be used as bridge to link people: President
President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the National Tamil Language Day ceremony held at the Jaffna Hindu College on Saturday said the language should be used as a bridge which link people, but not as a tool to divide them.
Even though some people are of the view that language should be used to make divisions among the people, as true human beings who value humanity, we must respect all languages of a country and must learn all those languages, he said.
The President said a small group who have no respect for humane values, were trying to scuttle the efforts to build national reconciliation.
President Sirisena said the Governments aim was to give equal opportunities and facilities for education to all children in the country, irrespective of ethnic and religious differences to enrich them with knowledge and make them productive citizens.
the President said the Government would discuss with relevant authorities the steps that could be taken to improve the income of potato farmers and imposing restrictions on potato imports. The President promised to look into issues of loans obtained by Jaffna farmers from state banks and provide relief if possible.
The President opened the newly built Technical Laboratory at the Hindu College.

Lets press for largesse for have-nots in distress
Today, October 17, is International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. Sponsored by the United Nations, it promotes awareness of the need to help wipe out hardship and destitution worldwide, particularly in developing countries.
The theme this year  selected in consultation with activists, civil society and non-governmental organisations highlights how important it is to recognise and address the humiliation and exclusion endured by many people living in impoverishment. The theme of the 2017 event is: Answering the Call of October 17 to end poverty: A path toward peaceful and inclusive societies.
Building a sustainable future
This year also marks the 30th anniversary of the Call to Action by Father Joseph Wresinskiwhich inspired the observance of October 17 as the World Day for Overcoming Extreme Povertyand the recognition by the United Nations of the day as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty.
The day also presents an opportunity to acknowledge the effort and struggle of people living in such dire circumstances, a chance to make their concerns heard and a moment to recognise that the poor are the first ones to fight against poverty.
Participation of the needy themselves has been at the centre of the day's celebration since its very beginning. It also reflects the willingness of people living in misery to use their expertise to contribute to the eradication of poverty.
Building a sustainable future requires us to intensify our efforts towards stamping out extreme poverty and discrimination and ensuring that everyone can fully exercise their human rights. The full participation of people living in poverty, particularly in the decisions that affect their lives and communities, must be at the centre of policies and strategies to build a sustainable future. Research shows that when a country grows economically, overall poverty is reduced. If the national income is not equally distributed among all communities in the country, there is a risk that poorer communities will end up poorer and individuals will feel it most.
Many programs aim at feeding kids at school and providing health services as well. This encourages parents to send their children to school and keep them there to complete at least their basic education. If children have food to eat and are healthy, they can learn and respond to the needs of the program. It is important that governments extend their development programs such as roads, bridges and other economic facilities to rural areas, to make it easy for goods and services and farm produce to move to and from the farming communities.
Interrelated factors
Poverty alleviation involves the strategic use of tools such as education, economic development, health and income redistribution to improve the livelihoods of the worlds poorest by governments and internationally approved organisations. They also aim at removing social and legal barriers to income growth among the marginalised poor. Why are these tools important Quality education empowers people to take advantage of opportunities around them. It helps children gain knowledge, information and life skills they need to realise their potential. Training teachers, building schools, providing education materials and breaking down barriers that prevent children from accessing education are important features of poverty alleviation programmes.
The youth and those able to work in the communities are provided skills to help with farm work or other economic activity, which helps them, earn money to make a living and take care of their families. With a bit of effort in these areas it will not take long to see real improvements in the living conditions of these communities. According to UNICEF, 22,000 children die each day as a result of poverty. And they die quietly in some of the poorest villages on earth, far removed from the scrutiny and the conscience of the world. Being meek and weak in life makes these dying multitudes even more invisible in death. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to end poverty in all its forms everywhere explicitly recognises that poverty results not from the lack of just one reason but from many different interrelated factors that affect the lives of people living in destitution.
This means we must go beyond seeing poverty merely as the lack of income or what is necessary for material well-being  such as food, housing, land and other assets  in order to fully understand poverty in its multiple dimensions.
For millions of women and girls in the Indian sub-continent and nations such as Africa poverty and sickness go hand in hand. Without access to basic water and healthcare, their livelihoods, families and education are all affected. Many of us do not realise that 70 percent of their illnesses are preventable. But you can help change this by empowering a community health leader. Poverty reduction is a set of measures, both economic and humanitarian, that are intended to permanently lift people out of poverty.
The international poverty line
According to a World Bank report 21 percent of the worlds population was in extreme poverty and more than half of the worlds population was in poverty. More than 30 percent of children in developing countries  about 600 million  live on less than US$1 a day. Every 3.6 seconds one person dies of starvation. Usually it is a child under the age of five.
Poverty hits children hardest. While a severe lack of goods and services pains every human, it is most threatening to childrens rights. Survival, health and nutrition, education, participation and protection from harm and exploitation are all issues that have to be addressed. It creates an environment that is damaging to childrens development in every way  mental, physical, emotional and spiritual.
The work to end extreme poverty is far from over and a number of challenges remain. It is becoming even more difficult to reach those remaining in extreme poverty who often live in fragile contexts and remote areas. Access to schools, healthcare, electricity, safe water and other critical services remains elusive for many people, often determined by socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity and geography. For those who have been able to move out of such circumstances progress is often temporary. That is because they are beset by economic shocks, food insecurity and climate change which all threaten to rob them of their hard-won gains and force them back into impoverishment. It will be critical to find ways to tackle these issues as we make progress toward 2030.
In October 2015, the World Bank updated the international poverty line to US$1.90 a day. At present the percentage of the global population living under extreme poverty is likely to fall below 10 percent according to the World Bank projections released last year.
Poverty cannot be completely eradicated, as it is largely caused by human factors. Over the past years there has been a lot of Poverty Alleviation Programs designed to break the cycle of destitution in many households and communities in the world. The results have been remarkable, but there is still a lot to be done. But it can be achieved with your help.

Lifeline to patients with blood disorders
Asiri Hospitals Bone Marrow Transplant Unit located at Asiri Central Hospital conducted the first successful stem cell transplant in the island by securing a matching non related donor through an international bone marrow donor registry.
Blood cancers such as leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and other blood disorders such as thalassemia are on the rise and are considered the third most common cause of death in the country. A bone marrow transplant can mean life for people with blood cancers and related disorders, especially children.
While our unit has been operational for about three years and we successfully conducted the first bone marrow transplant in Sri Lanka using a donor from an international donor registry. The donor from the registry was a South Asian national. The patient, a 13 year old child is now back at home, well and cured, Consultant Haematologist, Dr.Lallindra Gooneratne said.
In the recent procedure conducted by the Unit, a 13 year old girl afflicted by Thalassemia underwent an allogeneic transplant.
When stem cells are taken from a healthy donor, in this instance it was a non related but genetically matching donor. For allogeneic transplants, siblings and parents too are tested initially.However most patients do not have a genetically matched family donor, he said.
The unit also offers autologous transplants - in which the patient's own stem cells are harvested prior to giving him/her high doses of chemotherapy and then re-infusing the patient with them. This is currently the standard of care for patients with myeloma. The Unit provides treatment for patients of all ages in need of a bone marrow transplant.
There are international donor registries where they have several thousands of donors registered and their genetic makeup has been listed.
We can send our patients genetic reports to whatever country and they will check to see if there is a match. If there is match we can use those donor stem cells or bone marrow, to treat our patient in Sri Lanka, Dr. Gooneratne said.
Follow up is very important  minimum is one year while the first three months are extremely crucial. They have to be monitored very carefully and are on medication for a period of about one year.
The Unit also has a 24-hour hotline for patients to contact the nursing staff, he added.
The unit has been accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI). The unit incorporates the latest technology and techniques for infection control. Patients are shifted to specially designed HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filtered rooms reducing the chances of infections, a high possibility in patients with a compromised immune status. Staff at Asiris Bone Marrow Unit was specially trained by an expert Italian team to take care of the patients.

Lord Naseby urges West to support Sri Lanka
British Parliamentarian Lord Naseby in a convincing speech at the UK Parliament last Thursday, urged the West, and in particular the US and UK, to remove the threat of war crimes and foreign judges that overhangs and overshadows all Sri Lankans and their leaders.
Taking part in a debate on Sri Lanka, Neseby at the outset reminded the House that he has known Sri Lanka for over 50 years and is the current President of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Sri Lanka which he initiated in 1975. His speech gave a vivid narration on the history of Sri Lanka from the time of colonization to the end of war in 2009.
I hope and pray that as a result of this debate, UK will recognise the truth that no one in the Sri Lankan Government ever wanted to kill Tamil civilians. Furthermore, UK must now get the UN and the UNHCR in Geneva to accept a civilian casualty level of 7,000 to 8,000, not 40,000. On top of that, UK must recognise that this was a war against terrorism, so the rules of engagement are based on international humanitarian law, not the European Convention on Human Rights, he stressed.
We in the UK should reflect on the sacrifices of thousands of young Sri Lankan soldiers who died to create peace in that country, Naseby told the UK Parliament while adding that it was quite clear to him that the Sri Lankan Government was addressing all the issues raised in the UN resolution 30/1of 1 October 2015.
What is not on track and needs urgent attention is the war crimes allegations hanging over the country. These flow from the Darusman report, which, on a best-guess basis, two years after the end of the war, stated, there is still no reliable figure for civilian deaths, but then guessed at 40,000. This figure is bandied about by virtually every human rights organisation and the thousands of Tamil diaspora throughout the world, many of whom were LTTE Tamil Tiger supporters and still are, inflamed by Tamil Net and those ghastly Channel 4 Killing Fields films, which so influenced the previous Prime Minister, he said.
I reflect that Sri Lanka came to our need in two world wars and had casualties, and it was one of just a handful of countries who supported the UK over the Falklands. Now is the time to offer the hand of friendship and act to lead the international community to recognise what the truth really was, Naseby said.

Mahanayake Theras urge President, Prime Minister to solve SAITM issue
The Chief Prelates have urged the President and the Prime Minister to resolve the issue surrounding the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) with a solution acceptable to all stakeholders.
The Mahanayake Theras of the three main Buddhist chapters have forwarded a letter to the President and the Prime Minister yesterday urging them to come up with a solution acceptable to all. The letter has been signed by the Chief Prelate of the Malwatte Chapter, Most Venerable Thibbatuwave Siddartha Sri Sumangala Thera, Chief Prelate of the Asgiriya Chapter Most Ven. Warakagoda Sri Gnanarathana Thera, the Chief Prelate of the Amarapura Maha Nikaya, Most Ven Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera and Chief Prelate of the Ramanna Maha Nikaya, Most Ven. Napane Pemasiri Thera.
The Mahanayaka Theras in their letter state that the SAITM issue has affected the country in a negative manner. The Mahanayake Theras go on to say that the SAITM issue has not only affected the medical education and the medical field of the country but has affected the day to day affairs of the general public as well. Therefore, the Mahanayake Theras state that a solution acceptable to all stakeholders should be arrived at without further delay.
SAITM became a highly controversial issue with various segments questioning its standards and legality in terms of its operations as the only private medical college in the country.
The Government has taken a number of efforts, including halting student admissions and degree awarding at the SAITM temporarily, introducing minimum standards for medical education and bring the Neville Fernando Hospital affiliated to SAITM under state control.

Man City dazzle after Liverpool-United boring draw
LONDON, Saturday - Manchester City opened up a two-point lead over their neighbours Manchester United at the top of the Premier League on Saturday thanks to another display of scintillating brilliance in a 7-2 thrashing of Stoke City at the Etihad Stadium.
After the earlier high noon showdown between Liverpool and a United side lacking in any great ambition ended in goalless stalemate at Anfield, City cashed in with a third straight league match at the Etihad in which they have struck at least five goals.
Pep Guardiolas men became the first team to net 29 goals in their first eight league games of a top-flight campaign in England since Everton 1894-95.
Their sixth consecutive league win moved them to 22 points with United on 20 and Tottenham Hotspur maintaining third position on 17 after finally earning their first home win at Wembley Stadium, 1-0 over Bournemouth.
Sensation of the day came at Selhurst Park where Crystal Palace, hitherto without a goal and point to their name, downed champions Chelsea 2-1 with Wilfried Zaha, returning from injury, their hero thanks to a brilliant goal just before the break.
Palaces new manager Roy Hodgson celebrated his first win in charge but the defeat left Chelsea nine points behind leaders City, who are playing a brand of kaleidoscopic football at the moment.
Gabriel Jesus, with a brace, Raheem Sterling, David Silva, Fernandinho, Leroy Sane and Bernardo Silva all found the target in the demolition of Stoke.
Yet the orchestrator of the triumph did not even trouble the scorers, Kevin de Bruyne again the man of the match.
Their dazzle was a stark contrast to their neighbours negativity in the underwhelming Anfield game which the only Manchester United highlight was David de Geas great save to deny Joel Matip.
Liverpool, despite being much the better side, were blunt in attack, failing to convert any of their 19 attempts on goal.
Manchester United came here for a point and got it, said Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp with a sigh.
It was a good performance, I thought worthy of three points. We were unlucky in at least two, maybe three situations.
Chris Wood earned an 85th-minute equaliser for Burnley in a 1-1 draw at home to 10-man West Ham United, who had Andy Carroll sent off in the 27th minute after a couple of elbowing offences earned him two yellow cards.
Swansea City forged clear of the relegation zone with only their second league win of the season, a 2-0 victory over Huddersfield Town.

Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy Ajith Perera said that though some people say that the housing industry boom is a bubble about to burst it was not so.
The demand for both mid and high end sector would continue even though the Central Bank too had negative sentiments about it, he said.
The Deputy Minister was speaking at the Build Sri Lanka launch press conference at Galle Face hotel last week.
Perera said that today the construction industry is a major economic driver and one of the main reasons for it to grow is the appetite by Sri Lankan expatriates to buy apartments from Colombo as a future investment and also migration from rural areas to Colombo.
People also consider investing in apartments as a better investment than most of the other saving, the Minister said.

Total turnover value amounted to LKR 7.21Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 5.26Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 1.44Bn (+9.67% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 1.32Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by 1.58% W-o-W (or LKR 46.83Bn) to LKR 3,007.87Bn cf. LKR 2,961.04Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Banking, Finance & Insurance Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 56.26% (or LKR 4.06Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by Sampath Bank, NDB, HNB, Commercial Bank & Amana Takaful which accounted for 84.46% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified Sector meanwhile accounted for 26.49% (or LKR 1.91Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by JKH & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 93.15% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Dialog Axiata & Sampath Bank led foreign purchases while NDB Bank and Peoples Leasing led foreign sales. In terms of value, Sampath Bank and HNB led foreign purchases while NDB Bank and Tokyo Cement led foreign sales.
Point of view
Markets sailed past the 6600-mark this week, gaining ~103 points W-o-W as strong gains on the benchmark Index wiped off Mondays 13-point loss. Active participation by both retailers and Institutional/HNI investors helped drive the Index and turnover levels, resulting in PER levels on the ASPI climbing to 11.03x cf. 10.86x last week.
Although a decline from last week, crossings over the week amounted to ~39% of total market turnover (cf. 51% last week), led by continued interest in the Banking sector which helped prop market activity for the 2nd consecutive week.
Counters in the Banks & Finance sector contributed to ~43% of the ASPIs 103-point gain this week compared to an ~54% contribution to the Index last week. Relative to last week when the countrys largest listed private bank COMB accounted for the majority of market movement, this weeks crossings were dominated by strong buying interest in SAMP which accounted for ~48% of the weeks total crossings turnover.
The interest in SAMP led to the counter being the 3rd highest contributor to the Index (9.64 points) this week. The highest contributors to the Index meanwhile, remained CCS and HNB which contributed a cumulative 41.48 points, resulting in the top three contributors to the Index accounting for ~51% of the Indexs 103 point gain over the week.
Foreign investors meanwhile were net buyers yet again this week, although the net buying position fell to LKR 0.31Bn cf. LKR 1.85Bn last week as foreign sales rose over the week while foreign buying (cf. last week) remained largely flat.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to retain the current positive momentum although some profit taking is likely given that markets have risen ~4.1% in the last month.
LKR depreciates amid oil import demand
The LKR continued to wipe off some of the gains it made in August & September as importer dollar demand pushed its value against the USD lower.
The LKR depreciated against the USD for the 3rd consecutive week, declining 0.3% W-o-W (cf. 0.1% last week and 0.2% the week prior) with dealers citing state banks buying on behalf of the CPC as it builds up its crude oil inventory ahead of an expected fuel price hike1.
Private fuel retailer LIOC is expected to increase its prices amid the Groups financial losses and CPC is expected to follow to compensate for the losses it will experience from selling fuel at subsidized costs2 and as the IMF pushes for fuel price reform to help address the countrys fiscal imbalances.
Global crude oil prices meanwhile have been on an uptrend since 2016, hitting a 2-year high ($59.02/bbl) in September as markets remained optimistic that the OPEC would extend its output cut until 2018 and the demand outlook for the commodity would improve.
The OPEC, Russia and certain other non-member producers have agreed to cut their collective output by ~1.8Mn barrels per day (bpd) until Mar18 in an effort to reduce the existing supply glut, and OPEC and its allies are now considering extending the deal beyond March1.
The International Energy Agency (IEA) meanwhile expects global oil demand in 2017 to rise to its most since 2015, while OPEC has boosted its projections for consumption in Europe and China3.
Lower supply and higher demand is expected to push oil prices higher with the EIA raising its 2017 forecast on Brent crude by 2.7% to $52.43 and its 2018 outlook by 4.8% to $54.07.
Brent Crude oil prices have recovered ~28% since its YTD low of $44.82/bbl in June to close at $57.38/bbl on Friday.

PM READY TO CLARIFY POLICY BEFORE BOND INQUIRY
Govt. committed to transparency and good governance
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is prepared to offer clarifications to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Central Bank Bond auctions, his office said yesterday.
The Premier is ready at any time should the commissioners require him to respond in view of references to him during the public proceedings, the office said in a brief statement.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is prepared to offer clarifications at any time to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into Bond auctions in view of references to him during proceedings, the statement said.
It said the government was committed to investigate allegations made against it or its employees in line with the mandate received on January 8, 2015 to restore democracy and ensure good governance. Senior members of the Prime Ministers United National Party (UNP) were told yesterday that he should have an opportunity to respond because his name had been mentioned during the proceedings.
The PM had welcomed the Presidential Commission because it allowed an in-depth, independent investigation, a UNP senior who was at the meeting with him yesterday said. He was keen to have an opportunity to correct the misconceptions.
The Premier was willing to respond to any questions or clarifications from the commission in view of the testimony already before it, the UNP member said.
Unlike the previous administration, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe stressed that his government had delivered on a promise to fully investigate the Bond sales when concerns were raised.
The country lost tens of billions of rupees when the Rajapaksa regime bought worthless Greek Bonds, the Premier recalled.
The former regime did not even agree to investigate, let alone punish the culprits.
The Prime Minister said the new government has raised the bar by allowing a truly independent investigation.
Sri Lanka is a mature democracy now. Those in power can be questioned and held to account, the Prime Minister had said underling that making the judiciary independent had been a key achievement of his administration.
He also noted how the new government had built confidence in the Judiciary since its lowest point when Mahinda Rajapaksa had a Kangaroo court and sacked the then chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake in January 2013.
As much as the judiciary was undermined by the then government, the Central Bank too was rife with corruption.
The Premier pointed out that one of his first actions since taking office in January 2015 was to insist that Bonds were sold through an auction in line with the new policy of the Unity Government and doing away with the practice of private placement that thrived under Nivard Cabraals governorship.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said he was looking forward to making the governments position known to the Presidential Commission and that would set a new example on his administrations commitment to transparency and good governance.

Pope Francis recalls his Sri Lanka visit
Deeply moved by great number of Sri Lankans who greeted me
His Holiness Pope Francis, recollecting his visit to Sri Lanka in January 2015, said he was deeply moved by the great number of Sri Lankans who came out to greet him at the airport and along the road to Colombo, uniting across religions and cultures.
He made this comment on Friday welcoming the members of the Organising Committee for his Pastoral Visit to Sri Lanka back in 2015.
The possibility of visiting your country was a special grace for me, at a moment when, after years of strife and suffering, the nation was striving for reconciliation and healing, he noted.
Recalling the special arrangements made to welcome him, Pope Francis said, I gladly welcome you here; and even though I would like our visitors to feel at home, I cannot quite equal the forty elephants that greeted me on the road from the airport to Colombo! I was struck also by the moving and beautiful celebration of the canonization of Saint Joseph Vaz, the great missionary to the Pearl of the Indian Ocean, surely the high point of our time together, as well as by the vast crowds that gathered prayerfully around the Shrine of Our Lady of Madhu, symbol of refuge and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, he remarked. Your presence here today has brought something of Sri Lankas fragrant air to our house, and so reminds us of the many divine graces we experienced together in your country.
Entrusting Sri Lankas people and her leaders to the intercession of Our Lady of Madhu, I willingly invoke Gods blessing upon you, your families and all who cooperated with you in the planning of this Visit, as a pledge of peace and strength in the Lord, he said.

Positive Indo-Lanka discussions on fisheries issue
Sri Lanka and India agreed to find a permanent solution at the earliest to the fisheries issue which has lasted for more than three decades between the two countries.
This follows Ministerial level discussions between Fisheries and Aquatic Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and Indias Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Radha Mohan Singh, in New Delhi last Saturday.
Fisheries Ministry media spokesman W.M.D. Wanninayake speaking to the Daily News said the Government of India commended the initiatives taken by the Sri Lankan Government with regards to the sensitive issue.
Wanninayake said following positive discussions both ministers agreed to reach a final decision on the bottom trawling issue, which is one of the main concerns in the long lasting issue. He also said that Indian government has highly appreciated the dedication with which the Sri Lankan government is addressing the issue, despite the fact that bottom trawling by the Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan sea area destroy its seabed.
According to Wanninayake, the Indian Government has also observed that the Sri Lankan government has released 42 fishing vessels in the last year arrested for illegal fishing. It has also noted the contribution done by the Sri Lankan Navy to repair six such vessels which were not in a condition to travel, Wanninayake also said.
Wanninayake pointed out that the Indian government also has taken impressive steps towards solving the bottom trawling issue.
The Indian government has taken several important steps to solve the bottom trawling issue as well. By the end of 2016, the Indian government ceased from issuing a license for bottom trawling. Meanwhile, Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Svaraj, delivering a special statement to the Indian Parliament last month said, the Indian government has allocated Indian Rs.15 billion to redirect fishermen doing bottom trawling fishing to other forms of income. The Indian government is also promoting seaweed cultivation and deep sea fishing as an alternative to the bottom trawling method. They have converted a number of bottom trawling vessels into deep sea fishing vessels as well, Wanninayake pointed out.
The ministerial-level meeting was followed by the third meeting of the Joint Working Group (JWG) on Fisheries held last Friday. The Joint Working Group meeting was co-chaired by Secretary, Department of Animal Husbandry and Fisheries of India and Sri Lankas Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry Secretary Mangalika Adhikari.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) of India, issuing a press statement, said that The Indian side was satisfied with the progress on release of apprehended fishermen and detained fishing vessels in the recent past, while reiterating the release of all the remaining Indian fishing vessels in Sri Lankan custody.
The statement also said that India also apprised the Sri Lankan side about the recent initiatives taken by it to end bottom trawling in the Palk Bay area. It also states that India let the Sri Lankan side know about alternative livelihood opportunities being offered to the fishing communities in the Palk Bay area through open sea cage farming, seaweed farming and other allied coastal fisheries activities.

If the matter is not settled there, then you can file a civil action in the District Court with the certificate of non-settlement.

Record breaking monster bicycle
Bike builders are constantly competing to make the lightest bicycle possible, but not Jeff Peeters. The Belgian engineer set the Guinness World Record for heaviest rideable bicycle in the world: 1,895 pounds and 15.6 ounces.
Peeters rode his giant contraption down the street in Mechelen, Belgium, to demonstrate that it could be done. To officially break the record, he had to ride the bike a minimum distance of 100 meters, or 328 feet, which he did with no problem. Other than not being able to turn, riding the bike on a flat surface seems fairly easy.
To build his gargantuan bike, which measures 7.4 feet tall and 16.5 feet long, Peeters used large tractor wheels and recycled scrap metal for the frame. It appears that two positive gear ratios are used to pedal the behemoth and actually spin the massive wheels. A small chain ring on the crank connects to a large cog in the rear like a normal bike. But that large cog connects by way of a bottom bracket to another small cog on the opposite side of the frame, which is connected to the rear wheel with a second bike chain. The result is a super-easy gear ratio, letting you pedal the 1,900-pound bike. It's basically the same setup as a tandem bicycle, but way more awesome. Popular Mechanics

Ronaldo, Suarez strike again to kickstart their seasons
MADRID, Saturday - Real Madrid talisman Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona striker Luis Suarez took centre stage on Saturday in bailing their teams out with late strikes to silence their critics following slow starts to the season.
Ronaldo shrugged off a glaring miss by snatching a 2-1 win for Real at Getafe with a deadly first-time strike in the 85th minute to claim his first league goal of the season.
Barcelonas Luis Suarez celebrates scoring their first goal
The Portuguese missed Reals first four league games due to a suspension for pushing a referee and although he scored four times in the Champions League and once in the Spanish Super Cup, his barren spell looked set to continue against Getafe after he spurned an open goal.
Ronaldo, however, had the last word when he buried substitute Iscos chipped past beyond Getafe goalkeeper Vicente Guaita, who had turned away a potent shot from the 32-year-old in the first half.
It was important for him to get his first goal, coach Zinedine Zidane told reporters.
We will see how it goes now but I am very happy with his goal, and also Iscos assist.
Suarez, meanwhile, headed in Barcelonas equaliser in a 1-1 draw at Atletico Madrid and celebrated wildly, taunting the fans behind the goal before rushing to the adjacent stand and cupping his ears.
The Uruguayan has faced criticism for his lumbering performances this season, in which he had only scored two goals in eight previous appearances in all competitions.
Suarez rushed back from a knee injury in order to help Uruguays bid to qualify for the World Cup and his form appeared to suffer.
In the previous game against Las Palmas he ripped his shirt off and walked off the pitch before full time in frustration after missing a clear chance to add to the 3-0 scoreline.
He had boosted his confidence by scoring twice for his country against Bolivia to seal their place in next years World Cup in Russia and struck again by appearing at the far post to nod in Sergi Robertos arching cross.
Suarez played very well in addition to his goal but strikers live for scoring and his confidence will change rapidly because of it, Barca coach Ernesto Valverde said
When he doesnt score its as if hes in the shadows but he scored today and had another clear chance. He negotiated the madness in the penalty area well and I hope this is the start of a good run for him. - Agencies

Dominating from start to finish, Santa Cruz improved to 34-1-1 with his 19th victory inside the distance. Avalos fell to 27-6. Santa Cruz and Mares had already agreed to terms for a rematch early next year for the same 126-pound division crown Santa Cruz won over Mares by majority decision in 2015.
Lets get it on with Mares in the beginning of the year, as soon as possible, Santa Cruz said. Now were ready for Mares.
The WBA championship rematch was contingent upon both winning Saturday and Mares did his part by taking a unanimous decision over fellow Mexican Andres Gutierrez.
Im ready for that rematch, Mares said. Lets bring it on. March or April, Im ready for it.
Santa Cruz, 29, was impressive in his first fight after avenging his only loss in January by downing Britains Carl Frampton to reclaim the WBA throne. Avalos was stopped by Frampton in 2015 in his only prior world title fight. AFP

Sarfraz hopes Sri Lanka will come to Lahore
ABU DHABI, Sunday:<U+0B9A> With an air of uncertainty hanging on whether Sri Lankas cricketers would want to travel to Lahore to play the third T20 international of their current tour of UAE, Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmed made an appeal for the Lankan cricketers to come.
As such there are no issues. I hope their team should come, I dont know what the latest is but their player Thisara (Perera) came and played with the World XI, said Sarfraz at the media press conference yesterday.
Sri Lanka Cricket is expected to meet today and take a final decision on whether the team should go after the players had given a signed letter expressing their concerns at going to Lahore.
There are only two survivors in the current team (Suranga Lakmal and Chamara Kapugedera) that underwent that ordeal in 2009 when gunmen fired at the Sri Lanka team bus when it was arriving at the venue to play second Test at Lahore.
Since that incident no international team has toured Pakistan until quite recently when a World XI comprising cricketers from Test playing nations played a three-match T20I series against Pakistan in Lahore under tight security without any incident.
Cricket manager of the team Asanka Gurusinha said that the Sri Lanka support staff had spoken to the Pakistan support staff and have been assured top security as given to the World XI team and that they were prepared to go.
Anyway a final decision is left with Sri Lanka Cricket, he said.  ST

Sebastian Kurz: Austrian conservative set to become world's youngest leader

Austria's conservative People's Party, led by 31-year-old Sebastian Kurz, is set to win the country's general election, projections suggest.
Kurz is on course to become the world's youngest national leader.
The People's Party was set to win more than 31%. It is so far unclear whether the Social Democrats or the far-right Freedom Party will finish second.
Short of a majority, Kurz's party could seek an alliance with the anti-immigration Freedom Party.
Addressing his supporters, Kurz said: "It is time for change in this country. Today is a strong order for us, to change this country, and I say thank you to you all who made this possible.
"I'm overwhelmed, I am happy, and I look forward to working for Austria."
Who is Sebastian Kurz
Before the election, Kurz served as Europe's youngest-ever foreign minister, after he was appointed in 2013 aged just 27.
In May 2017 he became the leader of the People's Party. He began his political career in the youth wing of the party, which he chaired before moving on to serve on Vienna's city council.
Nicknamed "Wunderwuzzi" (roughly translated - someone who can walk on water), he has been compared to the young leaders of France and Canada, Emmanuel Macron and Justin Trudeau.
Much like Macron, Kurz has created a movement around himself, rebranding the People's Party - which has been in power for more than 30 years - as "The New People's Party".
What were the main issues
Immigration was the dominant issue in the run-up to the vote, and Kurz moved his party to the right in the wake of Europe's 2015 refugee crisis.
He appealed to conservative and right-wing voters with pledges to shut down migrant routes to Europe, cap benefit payments to refugees, and bar immigrants from receiving benefits until they have lived in Austria for five years.
The rightward shift was seen as a response to the success of the Freedom Party, which narrowly missed out on the presidency in December when Norbert Hofer was defeated by Alexander Van der Bellen, head of the Greens.
The stance proved popular with Austrian voters after a huge influx of undocumented migrants and refugees from the Middle East and North Africa.
The Freedom Party accused Kurz of stealing their policies. Their candidate, Heinz-Christian Strache, has called him an "imposter".
What next
Kurz is on course to win the lion's share of the vote but not a majority. If the forecasts are correct, he will need to form a coalition, most likely with the Freedom Party.
The last coalition between the Social Democrats and the conservatives fell apart this spring - and there may be reluctance to renew it. But an alliance with the populist, far-right Freedom Party could prove controversial among Austria's EU counterparts.
Kurz refused to discuss his plans, saying only that he would talk to other parties. He says he wants to wait for final results.
Polls have put the Freedom Party at an all all-time high of 26.9%, suggesting that the European far-right is not dead after emphatic defeats in France and the Netherlands.
The relative success of the Freedom Party followsan electoral breakthrough by the far right in neighbouring Germanylast month.
What about the opposition
The current chancellor, Social Democrat leader Christian Kern, looks certain to lose his position after a campaign marred by several scandals, including allegations that his adviser led an online smear campaign against Kurz.
Kern said on Sunday he had no intention of standing down as leader, despite the party's loss. "I have said I will stay in politics for 10 years and there are nine years to go," he told broadcaster OBF.
After a tumultuous year with internal rifts, the pro-refugee Greens party is among several smaller parties uncertain of reaching the 4% threshold required to enter parliament.

Sharapova fights to first title since drugs ban
TIANJIN, Sunday: Five-time Grand Slam winner Maria Sharapova was made to fight by 102nd-ranked teenager Aryna Sabalenka at the Tianjin Open on Sunday before winning her first title since her 15-month doping ban.
The former world number one, who returned to action in April, came from behind in both sets and needed four championship points in the tie-breaker before beating the 19-year-old 7-5, 7-6 (10/8). Sharapova clasped her hands to her chest in delight as she absorbed the feeling of winning her 36th tour title and first in more than two years since the 2015 Italian Open.
Sharapova, 30, was contesting the seventh tournament of what has been an injury-plagued and controversial comeback since testing positive for the banned substance meldonium in early 2016.
She exchanged 11 breaks of serve with the Belarusian, who has yet to win a WTA trophy, before finally clinching it in the tie-breaker when the teenager put a forehand return long.
In a tight final of high-decibel shrieking, Sabalenka was broken in the opening game but any expectations that she would roll over quickly dissolved when she won four games in a row to go 4-1 up.

SLFP cannot go for elections with Pohottu organisers: Amunugama
Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugma said the SLFP decided to remove all electoral organisers who were half-heartedly with the party and replace them with new party organisers since the party could not go for an election with people who promote the pohottu party while remaining as SLFP electoral organisers.
Dr. Amunugama was addressing the gathering at the Kandy City Centre on October 14 after opening the first Sri Lankan branch of the Japan's 'Miniso' Institution.
"The Local Government elections are to be held in January next year and the responsibility of preparing nomination lists are vested in the electoral organisers. Only those who are with the party by heart and soul can do the needful but not those who are in toe with a rival party," he said.
Dr. Amunugama said that even party seniors could not be kept as electoral organisers if they promoted rival parties because it was most unwise to keep them in the party any more.
He said foreign investments had begun to flow into the country and the investment in the Hambantota Port alone amounted to Rs. 1.2 billion.
The Minister medium and small scale investors should be encouraged to invest in Sri Lanka and steps would be taken in this regard with the forthcoming budget.
Dr. Amunugama said the Government had to bear a massive debt burden due to an order for eight new aircraft placed during the previous regime without proper planning.
The SriLankan Airlines had suffered because of the certain ill-advised decisions taken by a close relative of the former President who was at the helm of the SriLankan Airlines in the past.
Amunugama said the proposed central expressway would bring massive economic development to the Kandy region by linking it with Colombo.
"People should clamour for the expressway by calling on the Government to speed up the project," he said.
Kandy City Centre Managing Director Thusitha Wijesena, BOI Chairman Dumindra Ratnayake, and a delegation of the Miniso Institute led by its Chief Executive Tina Chen were present.

Sri Lanka 94th in economic  freedom of the world ranking
According to Canadas Fraser Institutes annual Economic Freedom of the World report, Sri Lanka ranked in 94th position, which is an improvement compared with 101th in the previous year. This years the report is based on 2015 data collected in 159 countries and territories across the globe.
This was disclosed at the Economic Freedom Summit 2017 hosted by Advocata Institute and held at Nippon hotel, Colombo, on October 11, to coincide with the worldwide release of the IMFs flagship World Economic Outlook report.
Advocata Institute, an independent policy think tank based in Colombo, conducts research, provides commentary and holds events to promote sound policy ideas compatible with a free society in Sri Lanka. The Summit was partnered by Fraser Institute, the Canadian public policy think tank.
The Summit had a series of events from October 11 to 13 centered on roundtable discussions bringing together people from industry, academia and think tanks to identify areas to reform Sri Lankas economy.
The discussion at the inaugural event focused on the topic of whether Sri Lankas open economy has paid dividends.
The main event on October 12 included a roundtable discussion and Sri Lanka release of the Economic Freedom of the World report.
Hong Kong and Singapore top the index as first and second. New Zealand, Switzerland, Ireland, UK, Mauritius, Georgia, Australia and Estonia are within the top 10.
The Fraser Index identifies weaknesses in the legal system and property rights, trade restrictions, tariffs, cumbersome regulation and controls over foreign investments as the major contributors towards Sri Lankas low ranking.
The summit presented an opportunity to find means of reversing this trend by identifying barriers to development and to kick-start the reform process.
Where people are free to pursue their own opportunities and make their own choices, they lead more prosperous, happier and healthier lives, said Fred McMahon, Research Chair in Economic Freedom, Fraser Institute, Canada, addressing the topic, The state of economic freedom in Sri Lanka.

Talking the baby talk
Mothers across the globe subconsciously change the tone of their voice when they talk to their baby, a new study found. Regardless of the language spoken, all mothers use a universal 'motherese' or 'baby talk' when they address their infants, which is an exaggerated and somewhat musical form of speech.
While it may sound silly to adults, studies show it plays an important role in language learning, engaging infants' emotions and highlighting the structure of language to help babies decode the puzzle of syllables and sentences.
Princeton University researchers have found another unique feature of the way mothers talk to their babies, claiming they shift the timbre of their voice in a specific way.
A mother shifts the timbre, which is defined as the quality of a sound, in her voice so her newborn can recognize and pay attention to her from birth, the researchers explained, adding that the same could be true for fathers.
For the study, researchers recorded mothers while they played with and read to their seven- to 12-month-old infants and when they spoke to another adult.
The differences in timbre they noticed were strong enough to be reliably picked out by a machine learning algorithm, and researchers said that the shifts suggested there was a universal form of communication with infants. The timbre shift was consistent across women who spoke 10 languages: English, Cantonese, French, German, Hebrew, Hungarian, Mandarin, Polish, Russian and Spanish.
The researchers suspect the unique timbre fingerprint mothers use when addressing newborns could help babies learn to differentiate and direct their attention to their mother's voice as soon as they are born. Future research will explore how the timbre shift helps infants learn. The study was published in the journal Current Biology.

## Title: When to revive a character  and when to retire them
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, October 16, 2017 - 01:00
When to revive a character  and when to retire them
This seasons foremost literary body-snatcher is John le Carr with his novel A Legacy of Spies. He has brought back, albeit in a supporting role, his most celebrated character, George Smiley, the short, fat and owlish spy who appeared in eight of le Carrs novels between 1961 and 1990. The new novel has been well-received, perhaps because it gratifies the nostalgic reader not just with Smiley but with other characters from the story that made le Carrs name, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.
This unexpected return at the far end of le Carrs career made me think of other writers who return to characters over and over, why they do it and to what effect. Naturally there are good commercial reasons for doing so but lets assume for the sake of argument that, unlike Hollywood studios for whom the sequel and threequel are essential bottom-line ballast, writers are generally not driven by avarice. (If they are, theyve clearly never read any of those reliably grim reports on author earnings.)
Ever-expanding series
There are, lets say, three main ways in which writers revisit their characters. The first is in the genre series, with crime and fantasy rich soil for returns. Clearly a hero who runs through a body of work gives the reader something to hold onto, and gives the author a central pillar around which to wind other characters and plots, as well as the continuity to drive longer story arcs from book to book. Theres a risk, however, of the writer falling too much in love, of the unstoppable force of an ever-expanding series meeting the immovable object of human lifespan  which is what happened to Robert Jordan, who died in 2007 before completing his twelve-volume Wheel of Time fantasy series.
One writer who did have the commitment to abandon his most popular character is Ian Rankin. Having decided early on to age his Edinburgh detective John Rebus in real time, Rankin realized he had to retire him when the character reached sixty. I wasnt bored with him. Each book added to my understanding of him. But he had to go. This rigorous approach  with the demands of verisimilitude  did, nonetheless, permit Rankin to bring Rebus back again a few novels later, by having him staff a cold cases investigation unit, a plausible end for a retired cop. The challenges of keeping it realistic for a man past retirement age  his health is failing so he isnt able to intimidate suspects the way he once did, as Rankin puts it  keeps the series fresh for both reader and writer.
Other writers create not just one recurring character, but a community of them, vanishing and appearing through a lifes work. Sometimes these are part of a formal series  Anthony Powells A Dance to the Music of Time, Olivia Mannings war trilogies  but the ad hoc approaches are, I think, more interesting. Take Bret Easton Ellis, whose psychotically vapid LA-based characters have attended one anothers parties and cameoed in one anothers novels, getting busy and popping Xanax, throughout his career. The interchangeability of his characters  or, more charitably, the consistency of his vision  may make that easier, and indeed I read
Curious affirmation
The Informers (1994) as a novel, thrilled by my own thwarted efforts to connect the chapters, before realizing it was a collection of stories. But he has also written a formal sequel: his most recent novel Imperial Bedrooms followed the characters of his debut Less Than Zero twenty-five years on. It was a dud, lifeless in all the wrong ways, with little of the wit that is Elliss greatest strength  a curious affirmation of Elliss claim that his motivation for returning to Clay and friends was never about audience-pleasing. I dont think about the reader  ever  and I dont care, he said at the time of publication. The reader, this time, didnt care back.
More amenable to the reader is Amanda Craig, with her satire-cum-mystery The Lie of the Land. On its acknowledgements page Craig lists the characters who have previously featured in her novels. Here, minor characters become major and vice versa. Craig cites influence in the books of Alison Lurie, and Balzacs Comdie Humaine, where as a reader it gave me delight to spot recurring characters. And as a writer, it helps turn the toil of writing into something more like a game you are playing in a parallel imaginary world.
Then we come to the le Carr approach, which is to write a major character into books only occasionally. Smiley has recurred in increasingly tangential ways, just as Philip Roths fictional alter ego Nathan Zuckerman did: first front and centre in those dazzling reflexive novels starting with The Ghost Writer through to The Counterlife, then as little more than a framing device in the later surge that produced American Pastoral and others.
Changing America
There is a grand tradition of exploring an individual life in a series of books, the grandfather being John Updike and his quartet of novels about Harry Rabbit Angstrom. Updikes genius was to take a character who in his first outing was unsympathetic, and in later novels build the readers empathy for him. Updikes purpose was giving the mundane its beautiful due and if the second novel in the series, Rabbit Redux, was perhaps a little too mundane, all was forgiven with the third and best book, Rabbit is Rich. Updike, writing each book at the turn of a decade, gave us not just a developing character but a changing America: race conflicts, oil crises, and the rest. Even when he killed Rabbit in the final, fattest volume Rabbit at Rest (enough. Maybe. Enough), Updike, in Martin Amiss phrase a psychotic Santa of volubility, couldnt resist resurrecting him in the 200-page story Rabbit Remembered, a neat ten years later. Updike admitted it was easy to keep returning to Rabbit. It was like coming home every ten years and paying a visit . . . It was a world that I had lived through as a child, and then it was a world that I had made. Updike died in 2009, a year before we could find out whether he would have made one final trip.
Richard Ford did it too, driving even more mundanity into art than Updike did, with the story of the sportswriter-turned-realtor Frank Bascombe: a sort of Rabbit by Richard. (In fact, although he acknowledges influence by the existence of the Rabbit series, Ford has apparently read only one of them: Rabbit is Rich. A good place to start, and stop.) The Sportswriter (1984) and Independence Day (1995) were masterly, but after the final Bascombe novel, the long and slow The Lay of the Land (2006), I had had enough and it looked as though Ford had too. A couple of books later, though, he found himself with a certain itch. Readers were asking him to write Bascombe again, and he wondered about fictionalizing the effect of 2012s Hurricane Sandy.
What he gave us was the excruciatingly titled collection of linked stories, Let Me Be Frank With You which had, at least, the virtue of brevity. But Ford denies any interest in developing Bascombes character: I dont really know how much Frank has changed. I just go on making him up.

Why the Line Between Fact and Fiction is Even Blurrier Online
When you write novels, you take from the world what you must, and give back what you can, and you take it for granted that the imagination is sovereign. But what happens when you are writing a reported story
Isnt it dictated by matters of fact and therefore outside the imagination My proposition is that the separation wont hold, especially not in the world now. When Im reporting I feel less like a news gatherer and more like an actuality seeker, someone for whom the techniques of fiction are never foreign and seldom inappropriate. The people I write about tend to inhabit a reality that they make for themselves or that in other ways consorts with fiction, and one is required to enter their ether and dance with their shades in order to find the story. When I was a young reader, I learned from the poets not to trust realityreality is a clich from which we escape by metaphor, Wallace Stevens wroteand the subjects of my non fiction, each of whom is real or began real, depend for their existence and their power in the world on a high degree of artificiality.
Recording device
It is the habit of the times to organize the ironies embedded in this state of affairs and call it culture. (Just look at reality TV.) And the creative writer, given what Ive said about metaphor, may have a head start when it comes to investigating that culturewhich is why we would do well, now and then, to open the notepad and turn on the recording device. Asked which of the arts was closest to writing, Norman Mailer once told me the answer was acting.
He talked about an essential loss of ego, a circumstance that most people wouldnt associate with him. But the principle will be familiar to writers of fiction and non fiction who are always on the lookout for a second life, believing it must be a writers business to invest freely in self-transcendence. I believe that is what F. Scott Fitzgerald meant when he said there can be no reliable biography of a writer, because a writer is too many people if hes any good.
We were addicted to the ailments of the Web long before we understood how the technology would change our lives.
External reality
In a sense it gave the tools of fiction-making to everybody equally, so long as they had access to a computer and a willingness to swim into the Internets deep well of otherness. J. G. Ballard predicted that the writer would no longer have a role in societyhe would soon become superfluous, like those characters in 19th-century Russian novels. Given that external reality is a fiction, Ballard wrote, he does not need to invent the fiction because it is already there. Every day on the Web you see his point being made; it is a marketplace of selfhood.
With e-mail, everyone can communicate both instantly and invisibly, as either themselves or someone else. There are 67 million invented names on Facebook, many of them clearly living another life, less ordinary, or at any rate less checkable. Nobody knows who they really are. Encryption has made the average user a ghostan alias, a simulacrum, a reflection. In this climate, only our buying power makes us real, and what self we have is open to offers of improvementnew eye color, better insurance, slimmer bodyfrom marketing firms and mobile-phone companies before they hand our data to governments, who aim to make us visible again in the interests of national security.
In W. H. Audens The Age of Anxiety, we meet Quant, a man who sees his own reflection in the mirror of a New York bar, surrounded by a facetious culture, by which he means a factitious one. It seemed to Auden an aspect of modern life that a man might see no correspondence between his social or economic position and his private mental life. Quant speaks to himself in the mirror. -Lit Hub

Wisdom of longevity
Ayurveda, the 5000 year old medical system, origin of which can be traced back to the Indian subcontinent focuses more on healthy living than treatment of diseases. Ayurveda is from two Sanskrit words, ayus (life) and veda (related to knowledge). The earliest concept of Ayurveda was put into writing by VedaVyasa, the sage and shaktavesha avatar of Vishnu, Dhanvantari in Atharvaveda, which is one of the four ancient books of Indian knowledge, wisdom and culture.
There are three main Ayurvedic texts. i.e. Charak Samhita, Sushrut Samhita and the Ashtangha Hridaya Samhita.
Sushrut Samhita teachings contains 184 chapters and description of 1,120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources.
Charaka Samhita, written by Charaka is the principal classic reference. It gives emphasis to the nature of each person: body care, mental regulation, and spiritual/consciousness refinement.
The third major work is called the Ashtangha Hridaya, which is a concise version of the works of Charaka and Sushruta.
AYURVEDA IN SRI LANKA
Our ancient rulers played an active part in not only relieving the sufferings of the people when they afflicted with disease, but also in ensuring that minimum standards of sanitation were observed.
Mahawamsa, refers to several kings who founded medical institutions.
Mention is made of King Pandukabhaya as having set up a lying in home and a hospital. King Duttugamunu provided food for the sick and provided medical attention for them.
Upatissa ii founded hospitals for cripples, woman in difficulty and for the blind and the sick he erected nursing shelters and alms halls.
Buddhadasa (398-426 A.D.) an eminent physician himself is also credited with the compilation of Sarasthasangrahaya a compendium of all existing handbooks, composed in Sanskirt. He appointed physicians to treat soldiers, horses and elephants. Special asylums were set up for the cripples and the blind.
Dappula II and Kassapa IV built hospitals both at Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa.
Parakramabahu 1 is also credited with establishment of hospitals and care of the sick. He built a large hospital for many hundred sick people fitted for their sojourn there, and had placed in it, the way described, a complete collection of all articles for use. There also he gave to each sick person a special slave (attendant). Two of the important officers in his administration were Mahavedana (Chief Physician) and Sulu Vedana (the Deputy Chief Physician). The royal hospitals were staffed with both male and female attendants.
Grant of medical facilities to Buddhist monks was considered an act of great charity as evidenced by references to such grants in inscriptions.
The slab inscription at Mihintale belonging to the reign of Mahinda IV is of special interest to the students of the Ayurveda. It refers to the practice of application of leeches to get rid of impure blood, a practice followed to this day.
The remains of the monastic hospital at Mihintale of which a detailed description has been given by H.C.P. Bell in the Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of Ceylon for 1910-II provides the best archaeological evidence of a medieval hospital in Sri Lanka. Of special interest is the sarcophagus-like trough of stone called medicine boat discovered at this place. Such troughs have also been discovered at Thuparama (in Anuradhapura) and at Medirigiriya.
THE REVIVAL OF AYURVEDA
In 1925 there was a demand by some members of the Legislative Council for the allocation of a sum of money for the training of Ayurvedic physicians. This was followed by the passing of a resolution for the appointment of a committee to study the feasibility of this proposal. The Committee recommended, that a Board of Indigenous Medicine be constituted to deal with the subject of training of physicians, and that a College is set up in Colombo for this purpose with a hospital and an outdoor dispensary attached to it.
The first Board of Indigenous Medicine constituted in pursuance of this recommendation consisted of following members. K. Balasingham (member of the Legislative Council-Chairman) A. F. (later Sir Francis) Molamure, D. S., W. A. de Silva (who later became Minister of Health) (Later Sir) D. B. Jayathillaka (who became the Leader of the House in the State Council), Donald Obeysekara (Bar-at-law and chairman of the Oriental Studies Society) C. Muthukumara and M. S. P. Samarasinghe.
All of are remembered for their untiring efforts to restore Ayurveda to its due place. Two of them however stand out prominently. They are - K. Balasingham, due to whose efforts the College and Hospital at Borella were founded and Donald Obeysekara who made a significant contribution for the promotion of Ayurvedic medical education.
The setting up of the College and the Hospital at Borella in 1929 is an important landmark in the movement for the revival of Ayurveda in this country. Between 1929 and 1961 when the Ayurveda Act was enacted is a formative period, the major part of which is marked by the role played by S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike for his efforts in placing the College and the Hospital which were originally state aided organisations under direct state management, for the provision of administrative machinery, for the registration of Ayurvedic practitioners and for the establishment of the Department for the Development of Indigenous Medicine.
He also made a substantial contribution to the development of the Ayurvedic curative services by initiating a programme of construction of Ayurvedic hospitals under the management of the Department.
Eight disciplines of Ayurveda (ashtangas)
1.Kaya Chikitsa (Internal Medicine): Kaya means living human body. This treatment includes all diseases situated in the body.
2.Shalya Tantra (Surgery): Describes about pre-operative procedures, general procedures, post-operative procedures, anesthesia and marmas (vital points). It also describes about bandages, shastra (sharp instruments), yantras (blunt instruments) and sutures (stitches).
3.Bhuta Vidya (Psychiatry): Deals with spiritual healing.
4.Shalakya Tantra (Treatment of diseases above the clavicle): It's a division of otorhinolaryngology (ENT) and ophthalmology.
5.Agada Tantra (Toxicology): Deals with treatment for food poisoning, snake bites, insect bites, dog bites etc.
6.Kaumarabhritya Tantra (Paediatrics): Deals with health and diseases related to children.
7.Vajikarana (Purification of the Genetic Organs): Deals with male and female genetic organs.
8.Rasayana Tantra (Health and Longevity): Deals with prevention of diseases and improving immunity and rejuvenation.
With the enactment of the AyurvedaAct No. 31 of 1961, the following important steps have been taken:
1) The establishment of the Department of Ayurveda.
2) The establishment of the Bandaranaike Ayurvedic Research Institute.
3) The expansion of the Central Ayurvedic Hospital, Borella and setting up of several hospital and dispensaries in different parts of the island.
4) Increase in the number of dispensaries run by the local authorities and payment of enhanced financial grant.
5) The establishment of the Ayurvedic Drugs Corporation
6) Upgrading the Ayurveda College as an affiliated body of the University of Colombo
7) The establishment of Boards for compiling the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and indigenous prescriptions
8) Publication of books on Ayurveda
9) Scheme for the training of traditional Ayurveda physicians
10) The establishment of the Ministry of Indigenous Medicine as a separate Project Ministry

World powers hit back at Trumps Iran decision
IRAN: Iran and the international powers that signed the nuclear deal have hit back strongly at President Donald Trumps repudiation of the landmark pact.
Germany, France, the UK and Russia rallied together with the EU late on Friday in support of an agreement they said boosted international security by stopping Iran from building atomic weapons.
We cant afford as an international community to dismantle a nuclear agreement thats working and delivering  especially now, Federica Mogherini, the EUs foreign policy chief, said in Brussels.
Its not a bilateral agreement. It doesnt belong to any single country  and its not up to one single country to terminate it.
Iranian president Hassan Rouhani said he stood by the deal, but would walk away if it failed to serve the countrys interests.
No president can revoke an international deal, the Iranian president said in a live television address following Trumps announcement. Iran will continue to honour its commitments under the deal.
However, if one day our interests are not served, we will not hesitate even one moment and will respond.
The head of the UN, Antnio Guterres, said he strongly hoped the Iran nuclear deal would remain in place.
The leaders of France, Germany and the UK said in a joint statement that they were all committed to the deal and were concerned by the possible implications of Mr Trumps refusal to recertify it.
President Emmanuel Macron of France, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and British Prime Minister Theresa May urged the Trump administration and the US Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking steps that might further undermine the deal.
Sergei Ryabkov, Russias Deputy Foreign Minister, said that Trumps position was extremely troubling, RIA news agency reported. Moscow now saw its main task as preventing the nuclear deal from collapsing, Ryabkov was quoted as saying.
The European leaders rejected Trumps scepticism over whether Iran was honouring the nuclear agreement, noting that the International Atomic Energy Agency had judged Tehran compliant. Mogherini also gave short shrift to Trumps declaration that he could choose to terminate the deal. The president of the United States has many powers  [but] not this one, she said.
The European countries indicated one area of potential compromise with the US when they said that they shared Washingtons concerns about Irans ballistic missile programme and role in conflicts elsewhere in the Middle East.

Zimbabwe to host World Cup qualifier in March 2018
The search for the final two teams in the 2019 World Cup will begin in Zimbabwe in March 2018, after it was announced the host of the qualifying tournament.
West Indies will be among the countries taking part in this competition, having failed to gain direct entry into the showpiece event.
They will be joined by the bottom-three ranked ODI nations - Zimbabwe, Afghanistan and Ireland - the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and the top two from the ICC World Cricket League Division 2.
Originally, Bangladesh were scheduled to host the qualifiers. But with their gaining direct entry, finishing in the top eight of the ICC ODI rankings on deadline day, September 30, Zimbabwe put themselves up for consideration.
The ICC inspected the facilities about a month ago and it is understood that alongside the two regular international venues - Harare Sports Club and Queens Sports Club - the grounds at Takashinga, Bulawayo Athletic Club and in Kwe-Kwe will be used for the tournament.
The World Cricket League Championship is already underway, with all participants having played more than 10 matches each. Netherlands are leading the points table, with eight wins. Papua New Guinea are second, Scotland third and Hong Kong fourth.
