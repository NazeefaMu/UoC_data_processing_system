Aloysius and Palisena further remanded
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena arrested in connection with the controversial Central Bank Bond issue were yesterday ordered to be further remanded till February 16 by the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
When the two suspects were produced before Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne, the Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects made a bail application citing that the suspects cannot be charged under Public Property Act.
The Magistrate directed both defence and prosecution to file their written submissions regarding bail application within this week. The Magistrate stated that she would make an appropriate order regarding the request after perusing legal facts presented by both parties.
Filing its first B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID on February 2 named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Chairman Arjun Aloysius, its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda appearing for the CID informed Court that there had been a direct loss to the government following the issuance of bond on February 27, 2015.
He said the suspects can be charged under Penal Code, Public Property Act, Registered Stocks and Securities Ordinance and Code of Conduct for Primary Dealers for illegal insider trading.
Meanwhile, ASG Kodagoda explained that this magisterial inquiry was not solely based on the Bond Commission report but a complaint made by Central Bank Governor Indrajith Coomaraswamy.
He further said that Arjuna Mahendran can be charged for criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of public funds and two others for aiding and abetting to commit this offence.
Defence counsel Kalinga Indatissa PC appearing for the suspects informed court that the suspects cannot be charged under Public Property Act and Penal Code for criminal breach of trust and misappropriation.
Evidence and material facts of the B report are not substantial to keep the suspects in remand custody. The exact amount of the loss had not been identified. He moved court that his clients be released on bail in terms of Bail Act, the Defence Counsel added.
The court had issued an order directing the Controller General of Emigration and Immigration to prevent the three suspects from leaving the country.
The Fort Magistrate had also issued an order directing former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to be appear before the CID to make a statement, before February 15.

## Title: Apple sells fewer phones  but profits rise

Apple sells fewer phones  but profits rise
Apple sold slightly fewer iPhones in the final three months of 2017 than it did the year before, but higher prices compensated for the dip.
The firm reported a record $20bn (14bn) in quarterly profits, driven by strong growth in Japan and Europe.
The results were the first official glimpse of sales figures for Apple's expensive iPhone X.
Chief executive Tim Cook said demand for the product, which starts at about $1,000, had surpassed expectations.
Quarterly sales at the firm climbed by 13% year-on-year to a record $88.3bn.
After an initial fall, Apple shares climbed more than 3% in after-hours trade. Apple released the iPhone X in November, coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the device.
And while the overall number of iPhones sold in the period slipped by 1% year-on-year to 77.3 million, the iPhone X had been the top-selling Apple handset every week since its launch, Cook said. However the tech giant also issued a weaker-than-expected sales forecast for coming months, which appears to reinforce investor concerns that demand for Apple products may be dimming.
Last year Apple launched three new iPhones, but one was not like the others.
The iPhone X was the main event, the talk of the town. In contrast, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus felt obsolete before Tim Cook had even finished his presentation. Investors were worried that the presence of the iPhone X would put off people buying the cheaper iPhones. And, given the X started at $999, those people may decide not to buy an iPhone at all.
And that appears to be basically what happened. Apple sold marginally fewer iPhones compared with this time last year (though the company blamed that on a shorter accounting period compared with the same time in 2016).
With the average selling price going up by around $100, to $796, it means Apple may be selling fewer iPhones, but it is making more from each one.
Apple investors will be seeing it like this: selling fewer iPhones but dramatically upping the price is certainly one way to solve that ever-present supply chain headache. So, a timid quarter by Apple's unparalleled standards. But by no means a problem.
Cook said he was not over-concerned by the dip in handset sales, adding that the 1.3 billion active Apple devices around the world provided a strong customer base for the firm's services businesses, which include Apple Pay.
Analyst Carolina Milanesi, of California-based Creative Strategies, tweeted that "1.3 billion users most of whom are extremely engaged with their devices is why the services numbers will be more and more interesting going forward".
Apple has been under a cloud after revealing that it deliberately slowed batteries in older phones, prompting investigations in several countries.
Jeff Fieldhack, research director at technology consultancy Counterpoint, said while Apple's opening quarter was "fantastic" for its new devices, it may struggle to keep sales levels up. BBC News

Arrest of Aloysius, Weeratunga, a drama: Anura Kumara
JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday attributed the arrest of Arjun Aloysius and Udayanga Weeratunga to a drama. He said the script for the drama was written several months earlier.
The government one time said that Weeratunga had gone missing, but he had met former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the latter visited Japan, he said.
Dissanayake added that these arrests are aimed at upcoming Local Government election
He said the JVP is confident of a major victory at the elections.
The UNP obtained five milion votes at the last election while the UPFA polling 4.8 million votes. Both parties will suffer setback at the election, he said. Dissanayake said the people have lost confidence in the SLFP, SLFP dissidents and the UNP.
A vast gap exists between the expectations of the party members and the party leaders, he said.

Bitcoin dips below $8,000.  India latest buzzkill
Bitcoin's rollercoaster ride has taken another plunge, and India may be to blame.
The price of bitcoin dropped below $8,000 on Friday before recovering slightly. It had slumped following a new broadside against cryptocurrencies from Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
By Saturday morning, the price of the cryptocurrency had rebounded to $9,239, according to Coindesk. That's still a far cry from the near $20,000 price it reached in December.
India will take all measures to eliminate the use of these crypto assets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payment system, Jaitley said in his annual budget speech.
While India's cryptocurrency market is still relatively small, analysts say it has the potential to grow rapidly as bigger markets such as China and South Korea enact their own crackdowns.
The Indian government has been cautioning its citizens about digital currencies for months. In late December, the finance ministry compared them to Ponzi schemes. India's central bank has issued multiple warnings that cryptocurrencies have no official backing and people who trade in them do so at their own risk.
Growing signs that the government and central bank could soon unveil regulations has made the industry jittery.
Indian banks have reportedly suspended accounts of top bitcoin exchanges like Zebpay, Unocoin and Coinsecure.
Unocoin said it had not faced any banking challenges, while Zebpay and Coinsecure did not respond to requests for comment. The banks either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.
But a person with knowledge of the matter confirmed that at least one of Coinsecure's accounts had been suspended, telling CNNMoney that it was done as part of a due diligence process.
These negative events play deeply into the fear factor of traders, Raj Chowdhury, CEO of cryptocurrency firm HashCash Consultants, told CNNMoney. HashCash provides remittance services and payment systems to banks and companies across dozens of countries, and also operates its own cryptocurrency exchange in India.
Chowdhury says India's moves to regulate cryptocurrencies are not surprising, given last year's epic surge of interest that boosted bitcoin to nearly $20,000 in December. The price has more than halved since then.
Last year was a wild ride, he said. This year it's gotten big enough for governments to pay attention.
India accounts for between 2% and 3% of global cryptocurrency trade, said Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of Unocoin.
India is comparatively a smaller market [when] compared to countries like Japan and the U.S., Vishwanath told CNNMoney, but he added that interest is picking up and there is tremendous scope going forward.
But traders are now worried that the government could nip India's crypto boom in the bud. Vishwanath said Unocoin users have been calling to get clarity on whether their money is in danger.
Harshvardhan Singh, who works at a startup near New Delhi, began trading in ethereum -- another virtual currency increasingly popular in India -- in May last year. He said he was a little worried in the short run after the government's recent statements and the resulting bloodbath.
But like many others, Singh feels virtual currencies have become too big to fail.
Blockchain and cryptocurrencies built on top of [it] are now part of this massive ecosystem which countries can't just afford to outlaw, he said.
Some industry figures agree.
We are not worried, said Vishwanath, adding that he doubts the government will take a knee-jerk reaction without proper analysis.
The government, on its part, has set up a committee to study cryptocurrencies. Jaitley said Thursday that it will await its report before taking any action. He also said India would look into using the underlying blockchain technology in its own digital payment systems.
HashCash CEO Chowdhury said many in the industry may even welcome regulation.
Last year it was the year of ignoring it, this year is the year of debating it, he added. Next year will hopefully be the year of accepting it.

From Crisis to Sustenance
Blue Ocean Strategy identifies  paths to systematically create  an uncontested market space
In our previous instalments we explained that Blue Ocean Strategyis a systematic way to challenge the conventional logic of competition in a given industry. The strategy guides you to expand the market by attracting non-customers, often large market segments that have been ignored by the industry and that are off the managers radar screen.
Blue Ocean Strategy, we also said, challenges conventional competitive strategy wisdom by engaging in the simultaneous pursuit of low cost and differentiation, unlike traditional strategy that demands managers must make a choice by focusing on either a low cost-driven strategy or one rooted in differentiation. A large number of executives and companies from around the world have benefited from espousing BOS ideas and principles.
Misconceptions
Now well address the three most frequently mentioned wrong misconceptions about Blue Ocean Strategy.
Misconception 1: Blue Ocean Strategy is a quick fix.
Some believe that all you have to do is draw a few PowerPoint slides and, voila, here comes your Blue Ocean! It is true that the BOS process is a systematic way to think creatively about strategic innovation: at its core lies a sequence of practical analytical tools that executives can use to re-think the value proposition of their products or services, to eliminate a variety of obstacles and legacy processes in their offerings and to discover new groups of customers that their industry has ignored. That said, it takes time  months or even a year or two.
Misconception 2: You can arrive at the Blue Ocean ideas using your existing bases of information and current understanding of their customers behaviour.
Nothing could be further from the truth. The generating truly great ideas that challenge entrenched ways of doing business usually involves extensive fieldwork, e.g., retail executives spending time in their stores and observing why customers leave their stores empty handed or why other consumers pass by their stores without as much as giving it a look. Bankers could benefit greatly from spending time in their retail branches or in their corporate clients back offices as would insurance agents observing their customers in their own settings.
We call this kind of fieldwork understanding the Buyers Experience Cycle, a way to uncover what we have termed as the Pain Points that stand in the way of customers and non-customers adopting your products/services. This fieldwork provides the raw material and insights that executives can process in combination with the Blue Ocean Strategy tools to challenge long held assumptions about how business is done, a process that then yields the most compelling creative ideas; the large Blue Oceans.
Misconception 3: You expect to pursue Blue Oceans on your own because you assume that you possess all the necessary resources and capabilities to put strategy into action.
Regretfully, thats not always the case. The real truth is that forming strategic alliances with others can often help companies to expand the size of their market opportunity and attract more non-customers faster and cheaper. It is important to understand what resources, skills and capabilities are needed to implement Blue Ocean ideas, which ones are available within an organization and which ones can be acquired from alliance partners.
Let us look through 3case studies.
Case No -01: Air Asia
Air Asia is one example of Blue Ocean strategy success. One of the significant changes that airline industry has changed is the involvement of budget airline industry. The good example in Malaysia is Air Asia.
Air Asia is a Malaysian low-cost airline headquartered in Kuala Lumpur. It is Asia's largest low-fare, no-frills airline and a pioneer of low-cost travel in Asia. Air Asia group operates scheduled domestic and international flights to over 400 destinations spanning 25 countries. Its main hub is the Low-Cost Carrier Terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Its affiliate airlines Thai Air Asia, Indonesia Air Asia, Air Asia Philippines and Air Asia Japan have hubs in number of Asian countries.
Air Asia have managed to avoid the red ocean and compete with major airlines as Malaysia Airline and regional airlines by looking into the factors that industry take for granted and also factors that important to customers.
Four actions framework
With the Four Actions Framework proposed by Blue Ocean Strategy authors, Air Asia have implemented many strategic moves to ensure they are making Malaysia Airline and regional airline company irrelevant.
Eliminate
* Over the counter booking system
* Free Food/Beverage on the plane
* Seating Class booking system
Reduce
* luxury facilities provided by Airport Lounge
* No of attendance service on the plane
* Seat Quality
Raise
* Focus on several key destinations
* Increase frequency of flight
Create
* Online Booking system
* Point to point travel system
With these strategic moves, Air Asia was able to focus on factors that really bring value to the customers such as point-to-point travel system, easy booking system etc. This helped Air Asia to reduce cost and at the same time increase the value to the customers - Value Innovation.
Besides that, Air Asia was able to look at current non-customers as explained in the Blue Ocean strategy. They understood that there is a wide segment of customer base  presently classified as non-customers; for example - Government Staff and those that cannot afford to buy expensive ticket such as who are in rural areas, students or fresh graduates.
However, Asia still has the potential markets with Air Asia when the number of Asian urban residents have been growing, Asian is young population, the use of cheap goods has become mainstream in Asia.
Case study No -02: Canon
Canons strategic move, which created the personal desktop copier industry, is a classic example of blue ocean strategy. Traditional copy machine manufacturers targeted office purchasing managers, who wanted machines that were large, durable, fast, and required minimal maintenance.
Defying the industry logic, the Japanese company Canon created a blue ocean of new market space by shifting the target customer of the copier industry from corporate purchasers to users. With their small, easy-to-use desktop copiers and printers Canon created new market space by focusing on the key competitive factors that the mass of noncustomers  the secretaries that used copiers  wanted.
By questioning conventional definitions of who can and should be the target buyer, companies can often see fundamentally new ways to unlock value. Path three of blue ocean strategys six paths framework pushes companies to look across the chain of buyers in their industry. By shifting focus to a previously overlooked set of buyers, companies can unlock new value and create uncontested market space.
Case No 03: Yellow Tail
Yellow Tail is the fastest-growing foreign wine label in U.S. history. In less than three years, it became the No. 1 imported wine in the U.S., selling more than 11.2 million cases.
Casella Wines began its meteoric rise by taking a different perspective on the wine market. It looked across the alternatives to wine: Beer, spirits and ready-to-drink cocktails, which capture more than three times as much in consumer sales as wine. Casella also discovered that most Americans actually found wine a turnoff. Wine was intimidating and pretentious, a highly acquired taste. While the wine industry long competed on how to make a sophisticated wine for special occasions, Casella redefined the market and made wine an everyday enjoyable experience.
Gone were the intimidating labels, the discussions on tannins and oak. Endless choice was clipped to two varieties, one red and one white. The labels were simple and colourful, the taste sweet and fruity. With no promotional campaign, Yellow Tail rendered its competition irrelevant. It didnt simply steal market share; it grew the market, bringing in 6 million new wine drinkers. Novice wine drinkers began to drink more wine, jug-wine drinkers moved up market and expensive-wine drinkers moved down to Yellow Tail.
Imitation
After reading this series of articles, some readers have written to us. Some were giving their comments and others were raising queries. One writer had a pertinent question. What if competitors jump into the blue ocean soon after it is created and make it a red ocean again
In fact, this question was once raised by a corporate interviewer to Professor Kim. This was his reply: Formulating and executing a blue ocean strategy in the right sequence will by itself build a rather strong barrier to imitation. The principle of strategic pricing, in particular, allows a value innovator to capture the mass of the target buyers fast, thereby achieving economy of scale, as well as earning brand buzz and creating a loyal following in the market space, which raises the cost of imitation significantly.
For example, sometimes value innovation simply does not make sense to a potential imitators conventional logic. But most importantly, as Blue Ocean Strategy requires the alignment of the three strategy propositions - value, profit, and people, once it is successfully implemented, it is hard to be copied as many times an imitator could get one or two propositions right, but not all the three of them.
As a matter of fact, eventually any strategy is imitable and a blue ocean may also turn red. This is exactly why Blue Ocean Strategy never intends to offer a one-time solution to companies. Rather, it calls for companies to monitor their value curves conscientiously and renew their blue ocean offerings by taking new blue ocean strategic moves at the proper time.

CBEUs Peoples Bank branch to strike on Feb. 7
Members of the Ceylon Bank Employees Unions Peoples Bank branch have decided to launch a one day strike on February 7 to protest against the alleged failure on the part of the Bank management to resolve many outstanding problems of bank employees.
The membership had taken this decision following the breakdown of talks held with the management due to its unfavourable response to the demands put forward by the union, said CBEU President T G W Gunawardene in a press release yesterday.
The release said the Bank management had pruned the rights of employees by abolishing the Transfer Board, Employees Board of Appeal, Joint Council on workers grievances, doing away with service extensions and through punishments meted out to union officials for participating in trade union activities and several other activities.
The employees had taken this action as a last resort because all efforts made to settle issues during talks had failed due to the authoritarian attitude of the management and the inconvenience caused to bank customers is regretted.

Four risks in Global Economy Lanka should watch
The world economy appears to be booming  in its latest World Economic Outlook Update, published January 22; the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that global GDP grew by 3.7% last year, up from 3.2%1 in 2016, which is the fastest rate of expansion since 2011. Whats more, this pick up in the global economy has been unusually broad-based. GDP growth has strengthened across the developed world, driven by stronger export and investment growth, while the major emerging economies have also performed well. This suggests that the world economy is finally shaking off the effects of the global financial crisis a decade ago. Indeed, the early signs indicate that last years strong momentum has carried over into 2018, with most forecasters expecting another solid year for global growth.
While this period of greater economic dynamism is to be welcomed, there are significant risks that shouldnt be ignored, particularly in the case of a small open economy like Sri Lanka with significant external vulnerabilities. Four major risks to the global economy which are worth watching are:
(i) The spectre of greater trade protectionism 
While the world trading system made it through the first year of the Trump presidency relatively unscathed, the risk of a lurch towards protectionism has not disappeared. In fact, if anything, this risk looks more likely to come to a head this year than last.
In the specific case of the US, the outcome of the talks to renegotiate NAFTA is a key thing to watch in order to get a sense of whether fears of greater protectionism are well founded or not.
While Sri Lanka is not part of NAFTA, the US withdrawing from the trilateral trade agreement would bode ill for the future of the WTO, and suggest that a trade war between the US and China is quite likely.
This would benefit neither economy and have a knock-on impact on the rest of the world, including Sri Lanka. Brexit is less of a risk to the global trading system, but negotiations between the UK and EU are also worth keeping an eye on, particularly given that the UK is Sri Lankas second largest export market.
(ii) A sharp slowdown in China
While the official GDP data imply that the Chinese economy continues to do very well, with the economy expanding by 6.9% last year.
Most analysts agree that this data isnt a good guide to what is happening on the ground.
Indeed, while it seems pretty clear that the Chinese economy picked up in 2017, there are some signs that it started to slow in the final months of last year as the government tightened credit conditions.
If this is right, we may see the resurgence of worries that the Chinese economy is heading for a so-called hard-landing, which rocked financial markets in late-2015 and early-2016. At the very least, this would lead to a tightening of global financial conditions that would weigh on demand in Sri Lankas key exports markets in Europe and the US.
(iii) A significant tightening of monetary policy in the major developed economies
The pickup in global growth has not yet triggered a substantial rise in inflation and there are few signs of upward pressure on wages. But as their economies strengthen, central banks in Europe, Japan and the US are increasingly turning their attention towards tighter monetary policy.
The risk is that a sudden surge in inflation leads to policy interest rates being hiked much more quickly than financial markets currently expect, sparking a selloff in these markets and setting the stage for the next global economic downturn. This prospect appears most likely in the US, where President Trump has just delivered a fiscal stimulus to an economy that, by most measures, is already running at close to full capacity and so could trigger a sharp rise in inflation.
The main risk for Sri Lanka here too is from tighter global financial conditions and weaker demand in its key markets.
(iv) A significant rise in global energy prices
This is perhaps, the risk least likely to crystallise in 2018  as things stand, the demand and supply fundamentals are more consistent with a slight fall in global oil prices from around $70 per barrel now to $50-60pb.5 But a war in the Middle East, perhaps an open conflict between Iran and Saudi Arabia, unlikely as it is, would send oil prices skyrocketing. This would significantly increase the cost of Sri Lankas energy imports and put serious pressure on the countrys already strained balance of payments position, not to mention its limited foreign exchange reserves.
Admittedly, there are upside risks to the outlook for the world economy too, and it is possible that we could be in the early stages of a prolonged upturn in global growth. But the lesson of the global financial crisis is that good times dont last.
Sri Lanka must use the current benign conditions in the world economy to ensure that it is ready to withstand the next global downturn when (not if) it comes.
To this end, rather than using the current strength of the world economy as an argument to slow the current reform efforts, Sri Lankan policymakers should leverage it as a compelling reason to push ahead. At the same time, and within bounds of the countrys current IMF programme, fiscal and monetary policy should be set in a manner that takes account of the risks lurking in the global economy.
If we achieve all this, there is every chance Sri Lanka will have a prosperous 2018.

GMOA appreciates Health Minister
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) thanked Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne for responding positively to the demands presented to him during the recent meeting, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said another progress review meeting will be held with Minister Senaratne within the next few days.
Health officials should speed up the process in order to fulfill the agreements made during the meeting held with the Health Minister but they are very slow and take time to work, he said. Learning a lesson from the past, at least now, health officials should understand that simple issues should be solved quickly without these leading to island wide strikes, he added.

GMOA calls for SATIM solution
The two batches of SAITM medical students should be awarded with a local state medical degree or a foreign state or private medical degree and not SAITM MBBS, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMAO) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo last evening, he said that until the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), political authority and the judiciary accept the foundation of the solution, they will not be able to solve the SAITM issue.
According to Dr.Aluthge, any solution should be according the Medical Ordinance and the University Act and should not violate any of them.
The MBBS to be offered to the SAITM students should enable them to register with the SLMC.
'The Government should immediately issue the Gazette Notification on abolishing SAITM and the solution given to the SAITM issue should be presented to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General," he added.

Govt.s debt burden management will bring economic benefits: PM
The government is now in a position to launch development schemes and bring economic benefits to the people as it has properly managed the debt burden bequeathed by the previous regime, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The government can enable the country to pay off debts within the lifetime of the present generation without leaving it for the future generations since it is the incumbent government which is better equipped to bring development to the villages and towns. People should return the UNP into power at the forthcoming local government elections as it has proven its ability to usher in development, he said.
Youth especially who are present in large numbers today should vote for the UNP if they desired to fulfill their hopes and aspirations, he added.
The Prime Minister expressed these sentiments addressing a UNP election rally held at the Kuliyapitiya town in support of party candidates contesting the local government elections from the Kurunegala district on February 3.
The Prime Minister who recalled that the UNP lost all successive elections held prior to 2014, said Harin Fernando turned the tide in favour of the UNP by resigning from his Ministerial portfolio and contesting the 2014 Uva Provincial council elections as the UNP Chief Ministerial candidate and winning.
The Prime Minister said this victory proved the prediction he made in 2013 that the UNP would obtain power after 2014. The Prime Minister said he was able to predict the UNP victory because the Rajapaksa regime had driven the country to total economic bankruptcy by going on an unbridled borrowing spree and taking foreign loans one after the other to service the debt.
The Prime Minister said Maithripala Sirisena, who was nominated as the common candidate, won the Presidential election in 2015.
After the General election which followed, they have formed a National Consensus government of the two leading parties.
This government would be in power for another two and a half years and the people should decide to elect the UNP to power at the local elections to filter down development dividends to the rural and urban sectors.
When the government took over power it had three major responsibilities to fulfill. They were to reestablish democracy and rule of law including an independent judiciary, foster reconciliation and develop the economy. There was so much of freedom in the country that certain sections of the media had launched a full-scale onslaught against the UNP in particular by criticizing it at every turn. The more they criticize and attack the UNP, the more people gathered at UNP election rallies. The Prime Minister said his main concern today was whether crowds attending UNP rallies would recede if this section of the media stopped criticizing and attacking the party.
The sound economic management policies adopted by the government had enabled it to manage the countrys debt burden. The government today had the freedom to launch development activities in the country. Steps had been taken to make the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport, which were idling as white elephants, to vibrant ventures. As a result, the country would be equipped with two international harbours and two international airport. They would be linked to an expressway network running up to Kandy. Industrial and tourism zones would start on each side of this highway network. There would be an industrial zone each at Kandy, Mawathagama and Bingiriya, the Premier said.
The Prime Minister said a vehicle assembling factory would commence at Kuliyapitiya buildings which were coming up at the site disproving pessimists who said that the vehicle plant would be a non starter. Minister Nawinna was taking steps to open a wildlife zone with an elephant habitat in Galgamuwa. A Medical Faculty and a Teaching Hospital would be located at Kuliyapitiya.
Udubaddawa too would come under the proposed development scheme. Three more national schools would be set up at Wariyapola, Kurunegala and Kuliyapitiya.
The Prime Minister said he would request non-UNPers to refrain from casting their votes to the SLPP (Pohottuwa) candidates because they would not have funds to develop their areas. To UNPers, he would say that the UNP had now truly begun its work to usher in peoples welfare. More had to be done to cater to their hopes and aspirations. There were people awaiting employment opportunities. They would be found employment in development projects in the immediate future, he said.
Those subjected to political victimization would be granted redress in the near future. The question before the UNPers was whether to retain the power they had in their lands or let it go. As such, he said he would request them to vote for the UNP at the forthcoming election to give the UNP the power in the village too.
Ven. Dr. Dambara Amila Thera, Ministers Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, P. Harison and S. B. Nawinne, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara also spoke.

Govt. ensures proper implementation of law: MP Jayawardena
Today, the law is implemented properly under the good governance government and officers properly implement the law on the Treasury bond issue as well, said United National Party Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena yesterday.
He added that seven Independent Commissions have been set up under this government so that officers are able to perform their duties properly. Today, no white vans abduct media personnel. MPs or Ministers do not sit in the chairs of the Police OIC.
Those days, Chief Justices were removed when they properly carried out their duties.
He said even Udayanga Weeratunga had been arrested by the Interpol and he would be sent to Sri Lanka soon. So no one is above the law, he said.
He was responding to a query made by a media personnel during a press conference held at the UNP party headquarters - Sirikotha.
MP Jayawardena said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes plan is to hand over the country to the future generation after developing the economy.
Today, the wealth of the country is the human resource, MP Jayawardena said. The Premier is of the view that much focus should be placed on education. That is why the Mahapola scholarship was increased by 50 percent. Earlier, only Rs. 109 million was allocated for the Mahapola Scholarship. But it has been increased to Rs. 912 million. A thirteen-year education was made compulsory. Steps were taken to introduce the Suraksha Insurance policy to all students around 4.5 million in number. They get a cover of Rs. 200,000. Further, the government was able to develop schools under the concept of the Langama Pasala Hondama Pasala.
He said smart classrooms would be set up, while laptops and tabs would be granted to students. He added that the National Youth Council is now free from political influence and is available for youths to develop their skills.
The Premier had spent Rs. 4 billion through his ministry to create an environment suitable for youths to engage in self-employment.
MP Jayawardena said Rs. 10 billion of SME loans had been allocated for self-employment. For the year 2018, Rs. 15 billion has been allocated for that purpose.
The government has been able to identify around 150 small-scale industries to be granted with loans. The government has increased the recruitment to universities by 20 percent.
The allocation for universities expenditure had been increased by two folds from Rs. 414 million to Rs. 832 million.
The government is spending Rs. 325 billion for education. We grant Rs. 25 billion for local government institutions for the construction of roads while Rs. 35 billion is spent under the Central government, MP Jayawardena said.

Govt. has to look into SAITM students future: MP Jayawardena
The future of the SAITM students has to be looked into by whatever government, although it was set up during the Rajapaksa regime, said United National Party Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardena yesterday.
He said it has been set up with a government loan of Rs. 600 million during the previous regime. He added although it was set up with low standards, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa granted scholarships to the children of ministers, MPs and even to a girl who sang for him.
He said the former President was a dictator, so nobody dared to question him. However, now everyone speaks of this since democracy is functioning under the good governance regime, MP Jayawardena said. This is the difference.
He was responding to a query made by a media personnel during a press conference held at the UNP party headquarters - Sirikotha.
MP Jayawardena said for a period of five years until 2015, the government had allowed to recruit around 1,000 students and the parents had paid for them. The students had studied there, so they should be allowed to continue their studies.
The UNP, as a policy, does not object to private medical faculties, MP Jayawardena said. If one objects, all kindergarten schools, international schools, other private education institutions and tuition classes should not be allowed to function.
He pointed out that however, thousands of parents send their children to foreign medical colleges to study and they come back to sit for the examination to practice here. He pointed out that there are limitations on the tax money that a government can allocate for education. He added that due to this reason, there should be some other institution set up at the same location in the future, even with private partnership.

Maze Runner: The Death Cure
Intriguing teen dystopia
The third and last installment in the series, Maze Runner: The Death Cure sees the Gladers back in action again. This time they are on a mission to recover one of their strongest colleagues, Minho, who played a prominent role in the previous Maze Runner films.
Frypan and Newt accompany Thomas in this venture in which they encounter Thomas romantic interest Theresa who has betrayed them to team up with those in the Last City to try and find a cure for a virus which is spreading its wings of death across the city. They also get to know that Gally has escaped with death and wish to help them in their mission. What follows is a gripping journey in which the team learns the lessons of heroism, love, trust and betrayal the hard way.
A feature one should note about the Maze Runner trilogy is that all three movies have done justice to the novels. They are full of intrigue and are spellbinding and not to mention horrifying! There are several fast paced action sequences in the film that will keep you at the edge of your seat. Newts tragic departure is heart wrenching and Theresas exit too is unexpected. Going along the traditional lines of these kinds of films, one would have expected Theresa to break away from her alliance with the WCKD organization and unite with Thomas. Instead we see her as a martyred when she falls to her death after seeing the wounded Thomas off to safety.
The special effects are handled in a commendable manner. Director Wes Ball has certainly made full use of the latest technology to create stunningly realistic scenes from the horrifying chase by the virus infected Cranks to the fire infused finale.
Those new to the Maze Runner series might find the first bits of the film a bit confusing but for those who are fans of the novels or the movies; this will be a visual treat.
A few confusing moments occur because there seem to be too many sub plots involved in the film. One such scene deals with Brenda and Frypan trying to save a busload of youngsters from being captured again. There are a few laugh worthy incidents but most of the scenes are serious.
Dylan OBrien stands out as Thomas among the cast. He portrays his role expertly as the loyal friend and tormented lover who wishes to give his life to save his loved ones. Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt and Ki Hong Lee too deserve being mentioned for their performances. The rest of the cast do well though they are not given much screen time.
If you are a fan of the franchise or The Hunger Game trilogy Maze Runner: The Death Cure will be of interest to you. The Maze Runner is the rare series that has improved with each installment.
Maze Runner: The Death Cure is screening at Liberty by Scope cinema.

The Court of Appeal yesterday fixed for hearing on June 12, the appeal filed by the Attorney General against the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder.
The Bench comprised Appeal Justices Devika Livera Tennakoon and S. Thurairajah.

While requesting to amend the punishments given to the convicts, the AG also suggested that these convicts should be given death sentence or life imprisonment as they committed the murder using weapons as members of an unlawful assembly.
Through this appeal, the Attorney General maintained that the sentences imposed on the convicts of British aid worker Khuram Sheikhs murder were not sufficient.
The petition also noted that the Judge had reiterated that the fourth accused in the unlawful assembly had used a firearm and that in cases of unlawful assembly an offence committed by one applies to all in the group.

A canvas of valour and beauty
Lankas princess who sparked fierce protests
Nearly ten months after the movie Baahubali 2 juggernaut took centre stage, the much awaited movie Padmaavat has now come to theatres with a bang. Padmaavat, Sanjay Leela Bhansalis magnum opus dedicated to Rani Padmini of Chittor who is believed to be a Lankan princess, has courted so much of controversy in India that nobody believed that it will come to the cinema halls so soon.
According to popular belief Padmini (Padmavati) was a princess from Sinhala desh (Sri Lanka) married to a Rajasthan prince and the controversy in about that is the characters in the story were not properly depicted and disrespect has been shown to Padmini who has now attained a goddess status not just among Rajputs - a warrior class - but also among other classes in India who too have regarded Padmini as the epitome of valour and beauty.
There is more to the legend of Padmini than her tragic end. Lindsey Halan, a retired professor of Religious Studies in United States explores why Padmini was worshipped among women in her book Religion and Rajput Women: The Ethic of Protection in Contemporary Narratives. She points out that in popular legend it was Padminis heroism which saw her plan an operation to rescue her husband after he is captured by the invader Allauddin Khilji. She writes in going out to war, Padmini disregards female custom and performs male duty. She further writes Treading on male territory, she assumes her husbands command. Padmini is heroic not because she fulfills the codified role of the pativirata (Dutiful wife) but because she departs from it to assume another more urgent role.
Even in Amar Chitra Katha comic series Padmini (Padmavati) is described as the perfect model of Indian womanhood. The root of the controversy around the film is the fact that there is not a single authentic document describing the life and time of Padmini. Director Bhansali has claimed that his movie is based on the poem Padmaavat composed by Sufi poet Malik Mohammad Jayasi in 1540. He wrote the poem in Farsi (Persian) script which was at that time the court language of the kingdom of Jayasi.
Literary saga
Even after Sanjay Leela Bhansalis statement that what has been shown in the movie is neither against nor insulting Padmini, the protests against the movie still continue. He says the story of Padmini is taken from 16th century literary saga by Sufi poet Malik Mohammad Jayasi. Many feel this may be a mythological or factious story, but Staya Narayana historian and retired professor of Osmania University, Hyderabad, says the movie is based on historical events, not a mythological tale and it is there that Allauddin Khilji did invade Chittor of Mewar. The siege of Chittor fort took place in 1302AD.
He further adds There is always a vision and imagination of a director and the actor to shoot a particular shot and portray it in a particular way. It always depends on the self indulgence of the artistes. Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali had earlier directed many super hit movies like Devadas, Ram Leela and Bajirao Mastani. Though controversies surrounded a few of his past movies too, this particular movie is an exception. Right from the day it began shooting the project has courted controversy.
Who was Padmini (Padmavati) She is the heroine of Padmaavat, a story written in poetic form by poet Mohammad Jayasi in 1540.
The story begins with prince Ratansen (Ratan Singh) of Mewar on hearing the beauty of Padmini falls in love with her. The Rajput prince crosses the sea to win her over. He later becomes the ruler of Mewar.
Beauty and virtue
Poet Jayasi describes Padmini as the epitome of beauty and virtue. She was only 18 at the time of her marriage and crossed the ocean along with her nephew who was a 12 year old boy to marry the prince of Mewar.
She lived in the fort of Chittor which is in Mewar, and she was popularly know as Chittors Rani Padmini. People of Mewar showered love and affection on her as she was considered the daughter in law of Mewar.
Rajasthan is the land of Rajputs, or the land of Kshatriyas (warriors). Rajasthan lies in the hot dry part of North Western India. Rajputs are men with features reminiscent of regal past. They are the descendent of valiant warrior clans. Poet Jayasi had picked this particular story from the songs which must have been living in the collective memory of the people of Rajasthan.
Ratansen (Ratan Singh) of Mewar came to the throne in 1302. His coronation took place at the Chittor fort.
Ratnasen ruled Mewar but for one year, by his side was Padmini, the beautiful princess from Sri Lanka. She was as radiant as the lotus she had been named after, and she was renowned throughout the land. Unfortunately princess Padminis fame and beauty had reached the ears of the Mohammedan emperor Aluauddin Khilji who had become the Sultan of Delhi. He was a descendent of an invader from Afghanistan. He was determined to have Padmini for his harem in spite of knowing that she was already married to the prince of Mewar.
Rajput honour
A direct attack on Chittor would have been of no avail for the great front in Rajasthan stood its ground firmly. Allauddin came instead as a friend.
He sent word to the Rajputs that he would be satisfied with a mere sight of the princess, and he would hence forth consider himself a brother to Padmini. Relying on the famed Rajput word of honour Allauddin entered the fort lightly guarded.
Padmini was reluctant to meet him and her husband decided that the sultan would have to make do with the glimpse of her reflection upon the waters of a pond, keeping the queen out of direct line of vision but the reflection itself was bewitching. The 18 year old queen of Chittor was indeed a treasure among women.
A glimmer of desire lit the sultans eyes in a flash as gemstone was cast into the water. The ripples broke the spell and the sultan was stunned into recovery. Khilji was still firm in his resolve to capture Chittor.
It is said Khilji had to give up his pursuit with the intention of returning on another day. Khilji invaded Chittor but was beaten back. He was furious and the threatened Chittor with destruction. The sultan made another attempt to capture the princess.
A siege of Chittor began the likes of which had never been witnessed before. The city remained secure as long as its defendants lived but there was no end to the tragic news that kept pouring in. One by one the best warriors of Chittor were lost.
For six months, the fort withstood the siege. Then provisions ran low. A terrible battle followed. It soon became evident that the fort could no longer be saved. Playing to heed to the wounds Badal the nephew of Padmini, who had earlier accompanied her on her journey from Sri Lanka, escaped to announce to the women that Chittor could no longer be saved and it was in despair.
A code of honour was announced, a great fire was lit and sacrifice was commanded. Husbands bade farewell to wives and children, promising faithfully to meet them the next day in heaven. A terrible battle raged, the valiant Rajputs fought to the last man, Chittor fell into the hands of the enemy.
Padmini in Bengali
Whether Khilji was successful in his pursuit of Padmini or not is the climax in the movie. The first movie on the life Padmini was released in 1948. It was in Hindi and was based on Rangalal Bandyo Padhyays novel Padmini in Bengali. Walli Sahib of the Punjab production company was its producer and director. His wife Mumtaz Shanti and Ashok Kumar acted in the main roles. Ghulam Haider was the music director. Then in 1964 a Tamil film Chittor Rani Padmini was made. Vyjanthimala acted the main role.
This writer wrote an article based on the life of Padmini in a leading Sri Lankan English newspapers weekend edition on May 20, 2012.
I believe that this story should be produced as a movie for the Sri Lankan audience, as this was a story of a Lankan princess. Unfortunately I could not pursue the matter further with the production house in Sri Lanka for various reasons. They were busy with their own production at that time.
Then in 2015 a Bombay based movie production company, Viacom 18 Motion Pictures in which Indian business tycoon Mukesh Ambani has major shares, developed an interest in the story, and Sanjay Leela Bhansali as co producer and director started the production. It was rumoured at that time that Bhansali approached Salman Khan and Aiswarya Rai for the lead roles and it was learnt later Aiswarya had refused the offer because she had issues with Salman at that time. Later Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh were given the lead roles in the movie.
Padmaavat was the most challenging project for the producers. I hope Deepika has done justice to the role that she has taken up. Padmini is the Pathini of Rajasthan, and now Padmini has come again to battle, this time on the screen with the audience.

Lanka performing well at primary education level-IPS survey
Significant policy gaps exist when it comes to secondary and tertiary education an IPS survey revealed recently.
It also said that Sri Lanka has been performing well at the primary education level.
IPS research indicates that only 35% of the age 15 and above population has completed upper-secondary education in Sri Lanka, and only 13.3% had completed tertiary education.
Meanwhile, the Labour Demand Survey (LDS) conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics has found that nearly one third of first-time job seekers coming from university or other higher education institutions are poorly prepared, primarily due to lack of job-specific skills or competencies as well as soft skills.
Speaking at the IPS hosted Policy Engagement Forum on Education and Skills for Prosperity Forum, IPS Executive Director, Dushni Weerakoon, highlighted that education reforms are a priority for Sri Lanka as labour productivity is the key to ensuring the countrys growth.Especially, foreign investors will be looking at the kind of skill sets Sri Lanka can offer when making investment decisions, she further said, noting the importance of embedding highly-demanded skills in the graduates.
The policy recommendations made during the Forum discussion included improving the quality of teachers, providing more teacher-training programmes, and making career guidance available at the school level.
The current school curricula and the examination-based testing methods were identified as major weaknesses of the education system. Better planning is essential with regard to the professional development and education of teachers, it was further noted.
The Policy Engagement Forum aimed to identify knowledge gaps in better understanding the constraints for improving the relevance and quality of education in Sri Lanka.

Maldives declares State of Emergency
The Maldives government has declared a State of Emergency for 15 days amid a political crisis in the island nation. The state of emergency gives security officials extra powers to arrest suspects, reports say.
The government has already suspended Parliament and ordered the Army to resist any moves by the Supreme Court to impeach President Abdulla Yameen.
The court had ordered the reinstatement of 12 MPs, which would see the opposition majority restored.
In a landmark decision, it also ruled the trial of ex-President Mohamed Nasheed unconstitutional.
Following the Supreme Courts decision on Friday, the government sacked the Police Commissioner who had pledged to enforce the court ruling. It also ordered the detention of two opposition MPs who had returned to the Maldives, and warned that any court order to arrest the President for not complying with the Supreme Court ruling would be illegal.
Opposition MP Eva Abdulla said in a statement that the State of Emergency was a desperate move that showed the government had lost everything [including the] confidence of the people and institutions. - BBC

NDB closes 2017 with impressive Rs 7.5 bn PBT
National Development Bank PLC (NDB) completed the financial year ending December 31, 2017 with impressive performance across all fronts.
The Bank recorded a 28% growth in gross income to cross Rs 42.5 billion. Net interest income (NII) grew by an impressive 27% to Rs 10.75 billion, supported with the dual impact of an enhanced net interest margin (NIM) of 3% and increased loan volumes due to the strategic balance sheet management and prudent repricing of assets and liabilities.
Net fee and commission income for the year was Rs 2,521 million, a growth of 12% over the year. The Banks focused approach in retail and SME sectors whilst working on the accelerated growth in trade finance and remittance business along with the portfolio growth supported this growth in fee and commission income. Chief Executive Officer of the Bank, Dimantha Seneviratne said 2017 has been a highly satisfactory year, during which the Bank stabilized its base, gathered rapid growth momentum and delivered enhanced results to all its stakeholders.
He contributed the success of the year to a streamlined strategy which was pursued with focus, and the commitment and dedication of NDBs talented team for precise execution.

Within total impairment, individual impairment saw a reduction of 47% to Rs 586 million. Prudent risk management and timely provisioning on the individually impaired loans led to this reversal.
The increase in the collective impairment is attributable to the large loan volume increase seen during the year, amounting to over Rs 46 billion.

Northerners get new friends
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, having alienated the minorities, which cost him his Presidency, on January 8, it appears, is trying to atone for the gung ho nationalist persona he is wont to project, to cater to the southern electorate. Addressing a local government election meeting in Jaffna, Rajapaksa bemoaned the racist label being attached to him by his political opponents, asserting that, far from being a racist, he took into his bosom all communities inhabiting this country. Rajapaksa went even further, asking the crowd how could he be a racist when the husband of his niece was married to a Tamil hailing from Jaffna, and went onto name his erstwhile kinsman from the north, a well known businessman, who thrived during the ten year presidency of Rajapaksa.
Mahinda Rajapaksa wants the public, at least the Tamil community, to believe that having a relative, who is a Tamil, purges himself of the stigma of being branded a racist, and, that, the majoritarian mindset attributed to him was a figment of the imagination of his political opponents. However the jingoism he is given to these days on the campaign trail in the south gives the lie to this open expression of almost filial love towards the Tamil community in the north. One perennial slogan heard these days with increased stridency from Rajapaksa and his Joint Opposition stalwarts is the imminent threat of a division of the country, through the devise of a new constitution the government is working on these days to offer the people of the north at least a semblance of power devolution. How Rajapaksa can stand before the Tamil voters and say he is not a racist and at the same time rails against attempts by the government to grant something in the nature of devolution, allowing the Tamils a governing structure to enable them to deal with their own affairs, under a unitary state, only the former president will be able to explain.
There are other reasons that calls into question Rajapaksa's claim to being a non-racist and a lover of Tamils. The day Rajapaksa lost the presidential election, and retired to his ancestral home in Tangalle, asked by the crowds on why he lost the election, pat came the reply that he was done in by the Tigers (in the north). This, after virtually pitching up tent in the north for a whole week, and, rubbing shoulders with the Tamil community, who, according to him, later, were Tigers, and, responsible for his defeat.
Rajapaksa's credentials as a leader who served all communities equally, instead of being a racist, he claims he is being labelled by his political opponents, also took a heavy beating, when, with one stroke of the pen, he banned the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil in schools and government offices in the north at functions, out of sheer pique after his Oxford Union lecture was cancelled at the eleventh hour, due to street demonstrations by Tamils in London.
To most independent minded persons the days that immediately followed the war victory brought out the worst in Rajapaksa, giving the lie to his claim of being a non-racist. Victory parades were held ad nausm, as if what was won was a war between two states, one inhabited by the Sinhalese, and, the other, Tamils, making the latter feel a conquered race. Marshal tunes, scripted by Rajapaksa lackeys, were given air, all too frequently, all centred on the maha rajano, comparing him to a latter day Dutugemunu. A special session of parliament was summoned, where, Rajapaksa hectored from the Speaker's podium that, devolution, if at all, will be granted on his own terms, and, not on concepts introduced from abroad, clearly telling India where to get off.
The former President, who warmed towards the Tamils in the north and denied he was a racist, only because one of his kinsmen happened to be a Tamil from Jaffna, only the other day, addressing an election propaganda rally in the south, found fault with the police for arresting youth in the south but turning a blind eye to happenings in the north. This, after police took into custody members of an unruly mob who attacked the Kataragama Police station, following the death of a youth, in a police firing, at a road block in the area.
Why this differentiation between youth of the north and south, on the part of Rajapaksa, whose proud boast today is that he united a divided country rata eksesath kala Doesn't this put to the test his claims in the north that he is not a racist
It was only last month that Basil Rajapaksa famously said during the opening of a pohottuwa branch office in the north that there may be those among the services who committed war crimes. He was also in full agreement that land in the north, occupied by the forces, should be handed back to the civilians. Now Mahinda Rajapaksa, on another visit there, disabuses himself of being a racist.
The northerners, certainly, have got themselves new friends.

Papare has come here to stay!
Papare is one word that any Sri Lankan would no doubt know without having to think twice that would cause their energy level to rise up in response.
Be it at the annual school big matches, at club cricket matches, national and international Cricket venues including One Day International and T20 Cricket World cups, and at any type of Cricket Carnivals, no Cricket match is complete without Papare bands and Papare music. In fact, one cannot talk about Sri Lankan Cricket without Papare as the non-stop merry music infuse such high level of energy in the whole atmosphere that keeps the fans and the players alike in high spirits throughout the game. Papare has its own unique identity in Sri Lankan Cricket that is well renowned to boost up the Sri Lankan supporters as well as the opposition side. It is such a lively music which has by now become a very popular music culture throughout the South Asian region.
Origins of Papare music
Did you know that Papare was originated in Sri Lanka, and its origins date back long before Cricket was ever known or introduced to this world as a sport This very lively and popular music culture according to the school of thought suggests that Sokkali, which was an oppressed cast, developed it to worship their Gods. The second commonly held notion puts the origin as Negombo, associating it with festivals that were held in at church and wedding ceremonies. In both instances, it was used as a tool to draw crowds together for the celebration and soon became very popular among all walks of life. Papare music has a distinct connection to Kaavadi music played in religious processions by the Sri Lankan Hindu and Sinhala Communities for dancers to pay homage to their Gods that generates a high physical, emotional and spiritual energy within them as well as around them among the spectators.
However, what started as a tool to draw crowds to worship their Gods, to draw people to church and wedding ceremonies, soon became the signature trademark of every Sri Lankan Cricket match both in Colombo and rural areas. As a matter of fact, Papare has by now become an important element of even high profile weddings held in five star hotels and any type of parties, birthday celebrations and many other occasions that gets even the most conservative, dignified middle aged and old ladies and gentlemen to leave their seats and start dancing and whistling and what not. The attention and the excitement are visible as the crowd becomes hypnotized by the sound and the beats.
Young Kids, middle aged men and women, elderly couples and everyone else dance continuously, and to those who are watching them sometimes it appears as if the occasion itself is merely incidental. It generates an infectious fever and vibe in the whole atmosphere; the moment the music and the beats begin that spreads rapidly across the surrounding which causes everyone to forget where they are and what they came for. The only thing they want to do from then onwards is either dance, whistle, clap and tap on anything they can lay their hands on.
Papare band and instruments
A usual Papare band consists of instruments such as the base drum, the side drum and the trumpet which are the core instruments used with a minimum of three members required to get the band going. However, sometimes the number of members in a band can even go up to around 15 to 20 as the more the people in the band, the higher becomes the spirit.
Despite the fact that the band members play in shifts, the stress and strain of holding the instruments and playing them for many long hours continuously, does not show.
Evolution of Papare
In the good old days the Papare bands consisted of mostly unemployed very poor people with musical talent, grouping together to earn a pittance to add to contribute to their daily bread and could be seen mostly in their sarongs in the big matches and other Cricket venues. But in the present day and age, the Papare band has evolved with time and musically talented and skilled professionals, mostly pensioners form groups with their colleagues and offer Papare music as a professional entertainment for any type of occasion that demands higher payments for their services rendered. They have continuous bookings and are high in demand due to diversifying their entertainment besides Cricket to any type of celebrations, offering their services to suit all income levels to suit their budgets.
The Papare bands that were once restricted only to the Cricket matches held locally, are now booked by the Sri Lankan Cricketing fans living abroad, way ahead of time for every Cricketing event held overseas that involves any of our Sri Lankan teams. Therefore, Papare band schedules in the present day include many foreign tours in their calendar.
The once nearly banned unique mode of entertainment that Sri Lankan Cricket cannot be identified without, on the eve of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011, Papare has survived through time and obstacles that opposed it by the sheer will power demonstrated against such moves by the Sri Lankan fans both here and abroad raising one formidable voice for their most favorite form of music.
As the annual College Big match fever crescendos, without a doubt, one can proudly say that Papare has come here to stay.

Many countries have made biographical movies about political heroes. Nidahase Piya D S is the first film of this nature to be made in Sri Lanka. Many of todays generation talk about freedom but they do not know the hard work, dedication, the sweat and blood which was shed while winning freedom.
The film brings these aspects to the fore.

SLPP misleading voters in Maharagama UC, alleges Devapriya
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) is carrying out an illegal election campaign and misleading voters in Maharagama Urban Council, Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya yesterday said.
Devapriya also said a complaint has been lodged over the violation of election laws and that they are to hand over a petition against the matter after the election as well.
Devapriya also condemned the SLPP for misleading the public by using photos of candidates who were in their rejected nomination list for Maharagama UC.
He observed that it is a violation of election laws to use the images of those persons when their nomination list got rejected. Devapriya alleged that the SLPP has given Rs. 5 million to an Independent Group that is contesting the Maharagama UC in the coming election, to stand on behalf of the SLPP.
According to Devapriya, the SLPP has forced the independent group to sign affidavits and take SLPP members as their own members.
Devapriya said the SLPP is misleading voters saying that if they vote to this independent group, the SLPP candidates can replace the list of the independent group which was accepted by the Election Commission. Devapriya also pointed out that this independent group is using the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in their leaflets as well.
Chief Minister Devapriya was speaking at a press brief held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institution yesterday afternoon.
The SLPP usually projects itself as a party that works against the United National Party. However, in this case, they seem to support the UNP instead. We condemn the SLPP for violating the election laws and misleading the public, he said. Asked if there would be changes in the government following the LG poll, Devapriya said that This is not an election where we are looking to change or replace a leader or any such thing. This election is to select qualified politicians to work at village levels.
"President Sirisena recently said that he is ready to form a SLFP government if all 96 members would stand with him. If those who have walked away from the SLFP are ready to come back, then we can think about changing the government, he said. Devapriya also commended President Sirisena for redefining patriotism as practicing financial discipline. He said it is a new political tendency and all are in supportive of President Sirisena in the fight against corruption.

## Title: Sri Lankas opportunity to leverage high-end Tourism with reclaimed beaches
## Supertitle:

Sri Lankas opportunity to leverage high-end Tourism with reclaimed beaches
The recent proposals of the Megapolis Ministry to reclaim the sea around the Galle Face Green and to extend it Southwards to Dehiwela, is a commendable idea.
In addition, the Expressway coming into the city centre with links to other expressways going North and South, will be a realistic move. At the city end, the expressway linking the Port, Port City, and the underground access to the city hotels and the Marine Drive going South is appropriate as there would be a North - South link and would ease the traffic circulation.
The reclamation of the Sea takes time. In Rio De Janerio, Brazil, the Copacabana beach and the adjoining beaches with improvements to the infrastructure has taken almost 60 years to complete and consequently totally transformed the area as a Tourism Hub in Rio. The Urban Designer has very cleverly integrated the commercial areas, hotels, and apartment buildings capturing the views of the Ocean and the Copacabana and other beaches.
In Rio, the Copacabana beach is four km in length and around 400 meters towards the sea and linked to other beaches. All these beaches are on land reclaimed from the sea. This massive land mass has collectively created a huge hub for Tourism and related activities. These include Marinas, Restaurants, and recreation areas for cycling, roller skating, beach volley ball, walking and jogging. In addition, areas for music and entertainment makes the beach vibrant both day and night. The annual Rio carnival which is considered to be the pinnacle of the events in Rio and the pre-carnival parades go pass the Copacabana Beach. All these activities have made Rio the entertainment capital of the World.
Therefore, Sri Lanka should also follow this concept and use the sea sand for reclamation, after studying the backdrop to reclaiming land from the sea. The reclamation would need to be preceded by a marine planning search exercise along the islands coastal belt. It could then identify the coastal zones suitable for reclamation, rather than pre-determined boundaries in proximity to existing urban hubs. It is rationale will exclude harmful environmental and marine  based coastal hazards to dominate requiring reciprocative remedial measures at very high cost. In this connection, initially it would be necessary to find out the width and length of the beach needed to be formed; in comparison to similar tourist complexes elsewhere in the world. Its decision can then be surveyed along the Sri Lankas coastline to study naturally formed beaches that may be suitable to be declared. Its impact on the sand dunes and mangroves may need to be factored therein.
The rationale for beaches to be formed by reclaiming the sea is found in many parts of the world for different purposes. Thus, in Singapore, more than one third the country is on reclaimed land and the land is used for tourism, entertainment, sports and recreation, parks and for cultural activities. Similar development has taken place in Hong Kong where the Disneyland and even the Airport are on reclaimed Land. In Macau, Japan, South Korea, Malta, Middle East, Maldives and even in Bangladesh reclamation has happened. Consequently, the existing infrastructure and land use within the city will remain, but, linked to the reclaimed area similar to the Port City in Colombo. This area will have to be carefully planned and designed to generate economic and social benefits to the country. Extending the reclamation from Colombo to Mount Lavinia will further enhance the economic potential of the country with Tourism and other related activities happening on the reclaimed land.
Nationally, the Tourism belt between Beruwela and Galle could be reclaimed where appropriate to expand the Tourism related activities. This has become important as the land alongside the beach is inadequate due to its close proximity to the railway lines and the Galle road. Consequently, it has become a deterrent for large scale comprehensive Tourism Development.
Two options are available:
Firstly, to reclaim the sea to give bigger frontages for the hotel development and for other Tourism activities. However, in Hikkaduwa, this may not be possible, due to the presence of corals and in a few other locations. In addition, in view of Sri Lankas small island status and due to the fact that populations in coastal areas have generations of associations with beach fronts, (example - fishing boats parking) it is best to secure the participation of these people during the early stage of project formulation. Otherwise, a conflict between the tourist facility and the community that now exists in Kalpitiya Tourist Zone, could dampen the ultimate vision of this exercise.
Secondly, to move the railway and road further to the East. It can be done, but, there may be some resistance from the villages. However, with generous compensation and alternative lands given to them they may agree to move. If so, greater benefits could be achieved as a larger land parcel could be released for extensive Tourism Development.
Sri Lanka should take a cue from other Tourism Developed Asian countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and even Vietnam. In these countries, they have strategic regional plans for each region highlighting the strengths of each region and by providing the missing activities such as entertainment, shopping, restaurants, sports and recreation including highways, railways, airports and IT infrastructure to be competitive not only with other regions, in the respective country, but also internationally. This is their success story.
Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka, we have not yet advanced to this stage to provide sustainable Tourism. A good example, is the Tourism Hotels in the Eastern region. There are hotels, but, to get the Tourists to travel to the hotels with the prevailing traffic congestion, is a issue, as it takes many hours to reach their hotel. Consequently, after you get there, besides the beach there is very little organized activity to keep them longer. Hence, the high end tourists avoid such locations and mostly the low end tourists and backpackers are seen at guest houses at these locations. For sustainable Tourism in Sri Lanka, it should be as described above and for other Asian Countries.
In addition to the traditional attractions such as, the beaches, wildlife reserves, cultural sites, tourism should cater for different age groups and introduce a variety of other activities such as, sailing, water sports, fishing, horse racing, golf, adventure events like climbing, biking, hiking, for tourists to be occupied.
Another area that Sri Lanka has not yet commercially exploited is cruise tourism. Cruise ships are getting larger in size and also the numbers of passengers are between 25003500. If Sri Lanka, are to attract cruise ships the Port of Colombo must be able to provide an exclusive area in the harbor for this activity, by providing more tangible docking and terminal facilities to accommodate larger ships.
The current experience in Sri Lanka has been around fifty passenger ships per year. These are mostly ships carrying between five hundred to around two thousand passengers. The objective should be to double this number initially and promote larger ships with greater numbers of passengers to visit Sri Lanka.
The concept in Singapore and Hong Kong is for cruise ships to use the ports as a hub and Singapore handles over 1.5m cruise passengers per year .The tour operators and Tourism in general, will get a huge boost if this concept is successful in Sri Lanka. There are other benefits that Sri Lanka could exploit by bringing in large number of high spending Tourists, similar to other countries such as Europe, North America, Caribbean, and East Asia where it is a huge business, Sri Lanka could also compete if a Tourism oriented infrastructure is provided, with duty free shopping and other commercial activities.
A growth of the locally available reservoir of knowledge, experience and enthusiasm to upscale Tourism is the magnet to be harnessed. It provides the breakthrough that can facilitate the multiplicity of the allied policies to harmonize for achieving sustainable Tourism and economic development. Therefore, the way forward is for the Ministries of Megapolis and Western Development,Tourism Development and of ports and shipping to mobilize local expertise and prepare viable development plans for implementation on a Public Private Pparticipation Model, (PPP).

Two arrested with IDs and polling cards
Two persons were arrested from Kalutara and Beruwela on Sunday for having IDs and polling cards in their possession which they had obtained by paying for it, in violation of election laws.
Addressing the media at the Police Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said at the time of arrest, the two suspects had in their possession six IDs and five polling cards, which they had obtained through payment in an effort to create an advantage to a certain candidate contesting the upcoming LG elections. The two suspects had paid Rs.18,000 for the IDs and polling cards. They were doing this to help a candidate gain advantage at the election. Further, it was also revealed that they had paid the electricity and water bills of four persons as a bribe to obtain their votes for this candidate at the upcoming election. The total paid for the electricity and water bills was Rs. 18,800, the Police Media Spokesman said. He further noted that this offence comes under causing undue pressure while payment of utility bills is an offence which is termed as bribing.
SP Gunasekara said the two suspects were arrested and later released on bail, but the candidate who had been behind this scam was ordered to be remanded until February 12.
This means that he would lose his opportunity to vote as well. We will seek the advice of the Attorney General and proceed with legal charges against him.
In the event he is found guilty of the charge in Court, this candidate would have to face jail term and he would also be stripped off his seat even if he wins at the election, SP Gunasekara said.

US train collision leaves two dead, scores injured
US: An Amtrak passenger train apparently travelling on the wrong track collided with a parked freight train in South Carolina on Sunday, killing two crew members and injuring at least 116 in the railroads third fatal crash in as many months.
Amtrak Train 91 was carrying 139 passengers and eight crew members to Miami from New York when it hit the CSX Corp freight train at about 2.35am local time near the state capital and derailed, the railroad said in a statement.
South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said it appeared that the Amtrak train was on the wrong track when it slammed into the parked CSX freight train, which had no one aboard.
Its a horrible thing to see, to understand what force was involved, McMaster told a news conference. The first engine of the freight train was torn up, and the single engine of the passenger train is barely recognisable.
The southbound passenger trains locomotive was left on its side, and the first car was bent and also derailed, although it remained upright, according to images from the scene in the small city of Cayce, South Carolina.
At least four cars of the freight train, which was northbound before it was parked, were crumpled, looking like crushed tin foil, but remained on the tracks.
The passenger train was part of Amtrak Silver Star Service, and the wreck occurred about eight kilometres south west of the states capital, Columbia. Local media said some 19,000 litres of fuel leaked as a result of the collision. but authorities said it was under control and posed no threat to public safety.
The number of injured rose to 116 from a previous count of 70, said Lexington County spokesman Harrison Cahill.
The injuries range from cuts and bruises to severe broken bones, said Derrec Becker, public information officer for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division. All the injured have been transported to local hospitals.
US President Donald Trump was getting regular updates on the crash while at his resort in Palm Beach, Florida. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone that has been affected by this incident, said a White House spokeswoman.
In December, three people were killed when an Amtrak passenger train derailed in Washington state. In late January, an Amtrak train carrying Republican members of the US Congress killed one person in a garbage truck with which it collided in Virginia.

The employees of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) who had been engaged in strike action since February 2have suspended their strike after officials from the board conceded to their demands to increase their salary by 25%.
What they have asked for is not unfair, they are usually given a salary increment of 25% to 30% oncein three years, said General Manager of the NWSDB Engineer D.U.Sumanasekara.
We have accepted their demands and are willing to give them an increment of 25%.
Engineer Sumanasekara said that the increment would come into effect from their March salaries.
The Joint Water Supply Trade Union which led the strike cited that their demands for salary increments had fallen on deaf ears and repeated attempts to come to a solution with officials proved futile.

President Maithripala Sirisena said as President he gave leadership to the whole country and worked for the betterment of all the people irrespective of any political, religious or communal differences.
He had told all his Ministers and Parliamentarians to fall in line and work accordingly to uplift the nation.
The President said he would therefore request the people in the North to vote for his partys candidates contesting from the Hand symbol as they to would work for the benefit of all without any petty differences.
President Sirisena expressed these sentiments at an election rally held at Vavuniya town on February 5 in support of candidates contesting the Local Council elections in the Vavuniya, Mannar and Mullaitivu districts from the Hand symbol.
The President said he learnt that candidates contesting the elections from a certain political party had vowed to work for the benefit of only those who supported and voted for them.
This is a wrong notion which should be detested by all. The duty of a person elected to power is to serve all without any petty differences irrespective of whether they voted for or against him or her, the President said.
President Sirisena recalled that it was he who appointed a Special Presidential Task Force to handle development work in the North and insisted that Parliamentarians and Provincial Council Ministers and members should hold its membership.
This proved our deep personal interest in ushering development in the North, the President said.
President Maithripala Sirisena said the governments sole endeavour is to eliminate fraud, corruption and waste from this country. Robbery of public assets by certain politicians had caused the escalation of poverty. He would ensure that all who defrauded public assets were brought before the law and punished.
It was during the last three yes that democracy and human rights were restored and enshrined in this country. Therefore, people who voted him to power could feel contented and rejoice, President Sirisena said.
Disappearances of people are never heard of today. No media institution had been set on fire either there had be no killing on abductions of media personal during the last three years under my rule,the President added.
Wanni district Parliamentarians Leader Masthan, Telo General Secretary Parajasingham, Vavuniya SLFP organiser Chaminda Wasala, Mullaitivu SLFP organiser Eeethanjali Naguleswaran and several others also spoke.

Wheels in motion to have Udayanga deported
Sri Lanka is now working through the Foreign Ministry and diplomatic channels to have former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia, Udayanga Weeratunge deported to Sri Lanka from Dubai, where he was detained by the authorities there while in transit to the US, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said. A team of Sri Lankan officers are ready to travel to Dubai and we are making all the arrangements to bring him back to Sri Lanka and file charges against him here, he said.
Weeratunge was arrested by the Dubai authorities on Sunday.
He was the former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia and had been using a Sri Lankan diplomatic passport, which had been cancelled by the Colombo Fort Magistrate, who also issued an international warrant for his arrest.
Weeratunge faces charges of having committed financial misappropriation to the tune of US$ 14 million while purchasing four Ukraine-built MIG-27 aircraft for the Sri Lanka Air Force in 2005.
An international warrant was issued for his arrest through the Interpol that he was wanted in connection with a fraudulent MiG aircraft deal. the minister said. We notified them that he was travelling on cancelled and invalid passports and he no longer had the right to use diplomatic passports, minister Ratnayaka said. We had notified him to surrender his diplomatic passport and obtain a new passport, but he failed to do so and through the Immigration and Emigration Department we notified the authorities that he was still travelling illegally on a cancelled passport. the minister added.
Accordingly, he was arrested by the Dubai authorities on Sunday. However, some parties in the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp are now troubled and worried about this situation and they are issuing various theories. However, we do not intend to proceed with this case the way the previous regime did with Sarath Fonseka. We will follow the proper legal procedures. When we file a case we do so for a reasonable purpose.
The case will be heard in a court of law and not at the Presidential Secretariat or Temple Trees. The law in this country assures fairness to all. No one has the right to threaten or attack anyone in this country and we will not stand for that, assured Ratnayaka.
Responding to media queries during a press briefing convened at the Police Headquarters yesterday, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said discussions were still underway with the Dubai authorities for Weeratunges extradition. However, he denied reports that a team of FCID personnel had left for Dubai to bring Udayanga Weeratunge back.
The FCID is currently in the process of initiating further action to facilitate his extradition, he added.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News, Senior Lecturer of the Colombo University Prathibha Mahanamahewa said when a citizen of another country is arrested in a third country there are clear laws that apply in terms of extradition.
Sri Lanka had issued an arrest warrant through INTERPOL and they notify their international network. In this case, Udayanga Weeratunge is also believed to have Ukrainian citizenship.
In such instances, the third party country generally extradites the detainee to that country and if there is an extradition treaty signed between these two countries, then it makes the extradition possible. In this case, Sri Lanka has signed an extradition treaty with Ukraine and this should make it possible for the Sri Lankan authorities to bring him back.
But there is a process as generally the third country (in this case Dubai) has to hand him over according to international humanitarian law guidelines, he noted.

Youth aware that their welfare depends on UNP: Mangala
Youth are attending United National Party (UNP) election meetings in ever-increasing numbers, as they are well aware that their future welfare depends on the UNP.
Candidates contesting the local government election under the Pohottuwa symbol are similar to the saying, old wine in a new bottle, for they represent a band of thieves who plundered public assets. They return to feed their greed, rather than to develop the villages, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing a UNP rally held at Hittetiya West in support of party candidates contesting the Matara Municipal Council Elections. Minister Samaraweera said the country's economy has showed signs of progress under the tenure of the present government. The country's primary account had shown an excess for the first time its history since the late Sir John Kotelawala period of rule. The opposition, which was smarting under this situation, was making false charges against it to deceive the masses and obstruct its forward march.
Samaraweera said the forthcoming local government election was an election aimed at building and developing villages and towns, rather than changing governments. It is by electing UNP candidates that people could expect a worthwhile service to their areas through their respective municipal councils. The people could repose their faith in UNP candidates, as they belonged to a clean, disciplined and unblemished team.
Former Matara district Parliamentarian H R Wimalasiri, former Mayor of Matara Upul Nishantha and several others also spoke. A group of more than 20 Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) youth supporters greeted Minister Samaraweera with sheaves of betel and joined the UNP to lend their support to the party at the forthcoming election.
