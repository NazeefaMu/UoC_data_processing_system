Murray to face Verdasco in Paris opener
Paris: Andy Murray will meet Fernando Verdasco in his opening match at the Paris Masters after the Spaniard advanced at the expense of injured Dutchman Robin Haase on Monday.
Verdasco, a former world number seven, was leading 6-2, 3-2 before a hip injury forced Haase to throw in the towel in their first-round encounter.
World number two Murray can dethrone Novak Djokovic at the top of the rankings with victory in the French capital if the Serb fails to reach the final, or if the Briton makes the final and Djokovic falls before the semis.
Former Australian Open finalist Marcos Baghdatis defeated French wildcard Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-2, 6-4, while Benoit Paire joined the French exodus after losing 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) to Paolo Lorenzi.
Pablo Carreno Busta, who defeated Fabio Fognini to lift the Kremlin Cup in Moscow a week ago, dealt the Italian another loss in Paris, racing to a 6-3, 6-1 victory.
Djokovic takes on the winner of Tuesdays match between Nicolas Almagro and Gilles Muller after receiving a first-round bye, while US Open champion Stan Wawrinka begins against Germanys Jan-Lennard Struff, who thrashed Illya Marchenko 6-1, 6-1. Tomas Berdych is ninth in the Race to London standings with the Czech needing to progress to the last four to remain in with a chance of playing at the end-of-season Tour finals next month.
He trails Dominic Thiem and Marin Cilic, a winner in Basel at the weekend, in the battle for the final two places in the eight-man field and must beat Portugals Joao Sousa to remain in contention. AFP

Did Pakistans Khan  really win 555 in a row
London: Pakistan squash legend Jahangir Khan is famed for winning 555 matches in a row, but a new book has cast doubt on the figure and says it might be much lower.
In Jahangir Khan 555, authors Rod Gilmour and Alan Thatcher say nobody was keeping proper records during Khans five-and-a-half-year unbeaten run from 1981 to 1986.
Khans streak of 555 is credited as the longest unbeaten run in any sport, but the authors say their research has convinced them the figure is factually incorrect.
There were no statisticians at the time chronicling his matches and not once has the figure been highlighted in press reports of the time, Gilmour said in a press release.
We believe that it could be significantly lower. After all, he would have to have played over 20 world tour tournaments each year for five years, which at the time was certainly not the case in tour matches.
However, Khan insisted the figure could be even higher than 555, as it doesnt take into account exhibition matches.
His winning streak from 1981 was finally brought to a halt by New Zealands Ross Norman at the 1986 world championships in Toulouse.
If you calculate it, it could be more. I played invitational, exhibition and challenge matches, he was quoted as saying.
The 555 figure should only be my tournament matches. But it could be between six to seven hundred matches if you include the others. Because I wasnt losing those either!
Thatcher said if Khan didnt win 555 in a row, the longest winning streak would go to Dutch wheelchair tennis legend Esther Vergeer, who won 470 consecutive matches over 10 years until her retirement in 2013.
His five-and-a-half-year unbeaten run is certainly not disputed. That will surely never be conquered, Thatcher said. Its the final tally which we wanted to solve for accuracys sake. The real figure Its hard to say. But it could be lower than 500. AFP

Thirimanne  needs a break from cricket  - Gunawardene
Sri Lanka A team coach Avishka Gunawardene is of the view that a break from cricket would do a world of good to beleaguered top order batsman Lahiru Thirimanne.
Everyone goes through a bad patch sometimes it is best to give it a break, a few weeks from cricket, said Gunawardene who watched Thirimanne struggling to get runs on the board in the recently concluded three-match unofficial test series for Sri Lanka A against West Indies A.
Thirimanne managed just 59 runs from six innings with a top score of 27 to average a poor 9.83.
The series flop was just another continuation of his alarming slump in form since June 2014. In 16 Tests (31 innings) since then Thirimanne has crossed the fifty mark only twice (highest score 62 n.o.) and averages 18.27.
Sometimes when you do wrong things and when you take a break you forget them. You basically tend to forget what you are doing wrong and you come out fresh, said Gunawardene who watched Thirimanne at close quarters during the West Indies A series.
Thirimanne needs to take his mind off cricket and take a break. There is hardly anything wrong with his technique it is probably more mental than technique you could see when you talk to him, said Gunawardene.
In the 4-day game he dropped a few chances and its all to do with confidence. His confidence level is a little down. He tried to defend while batting and he got out and in the second innings he tried to attack and still got out. He is just going through a bad patch and needs to have a few weeks break.
Thirimanne is a very good player and we all know he is capable of big innings. To me he just needs to get out and take a break for a couple of weeks and come out with a fresh mind, Gunawardene said.
Its a good opportunity for him in the upcoming domestic season to go and get back into form, score some big runs and get his confidence and rhythm back.
The 27-year-old left-hander who broke into the international circuit in 2011 was tipped to play the role of number three in the Sri Lankan batting line-up after the retirement of Kumar Sangakkara, a position he has so far not fulfilled.

West Indies on brink of consolation victory
SHARJAH, Wednesday : Skipper Jason Holder took a maiden five-wicket haul and opener Kraigg Brathwaite stood firm in a tense chase to bring West Indies in sight of a consolation win in the third and final Test against Pakistan in Sharjah on Wednesday.
Holder set his team -- without a win in their last 13 Tests -- on the right path with a career-best 5-30 to dismantle Pakistan for 208, which gave the West Indies a target of 153 in 135 overs spread over four sessions.
When bad light forced closure nine overs early on the fourth and penultimate day, Brathwaite was unbeaten on 44 to anchor West Indies to 114-5, still needing 39 runs with five wickets intact.
Brathwaite, who carried his bat in the first innings with 142, has so far added 47 runs for the sixth wicket with Shane Dowrich (36 not out) to lift West Indies from a struggling 67-5.
Brathwaite, who survived a bat-pad catch review on 43, has hit four boundaries in another resolute 88-ball knock, frustrating Pakistans bowling for a second time in the match.
Dowrich has hit a six and three boundaries for the West Indies.
Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said it could still go either way.
He added: We are two wickets away from being favourites and this can happen in two balls.
We should have scored big in the first innings and a below par score of 281 left us play chasing games.
From 23 without loss, West Indies slumped to 67-5 with leg-spinner Yasir Shah (3-30) dismissing Leon Johnson leg-before for 12, Darren Bravo caught behind for three and Marlon Samuels caught in the deep for 10 in the space of 13 balls.
Paceman Wahab Riaz then had Jermaine Blackwood bowled for four with a sharp incoming delivery and Roston Chase caught flicking by a jumping Mohammad Nawaz for two to bring Pakistan back in the game.
It could have been worse for the West Indies had Pakistan not dropped two catches in the first three overs.
With only a single scored, Johnson on nought edged Mohammad Amirs fifth delivery of the innings to third slip, where Pakistan skipper Misbah-ul-Haq grassed a simple catch.
Johnson again survived a slip catch on three when Sami Aslam dropped another straightforward opportunity at first slip off a luckless Amir, hurting Pakistans chances of early wickets.
Earlier, Pakistans chances of building a good lead ended when they slumped from 159-5 at lunch to lose their last five wickets for just 49 runs.

AFC Solidarity Cup Football : Sri Lanka takes on Laos today
Sri Lanka will take on Laos in their opening match of the AFC Solidarity Cup Football Championship at the Sarawak International Stadium, Malaysia today. The group B match will see the two of the strongest teams of the group fighting for their first victory in the tournament.
Sri Lanka is ranked at 193 while Laos is slotted at 177 in world rankings. The match record between the two nations implies Sri Lanka has a slight edge over Laos. The last three games have produced mixed results as each country won a match each with one game drawn.
The Sri Lankan team is coached by Dudley Steinwall who led the nation to a 3/0 win in the 2003 World Cup qualifier. Laos has registered their only win against Sri Lanka in 2013 on home soil, beating the visitors by 4/2.
Laos savoured mixed fortunes this year winning three games and losing five with two matches ending in draws. In contrast Sri Lanka were beaten in all their three matches.
Coach Steinwall said that our players are in high spirit to face the challenge and it is very advantageous to bring out their best for the country. We know that if we win this game, our path to the semis will be a comfortable one. At least a draw will make our position strong in Group B, he explained.
I have limited our practices due to overnight heavy rains, as I do not want to take the risk of causing injuries to players. But if our players perform to their best of ability, the victory is within our reach, Stanvol said.

Australia v South Africa 1st Test at Perth : Nicely matched intriguing series starts today
PERTH: The much-anticipated first Test between Australia and South Africa has arrived at last, and the Proteas will be eager to repeat the success they enjoyed in Perth four years ago.
The visitors have stated they are not thinking abut that 309-run win that sealed the series, but they will surely take some confidence from it, even without AB de Villiers this time.
Faf du Plessis leads the side in Oz for the first time and the pressure on him is immense, both as skipper and batsman. He and Hashim Amla will be expected to score big.
The sides are nicely matched, it must be said. Both have excellent batting top orders, and both have opening bowlers feared around the world. Steyn v Starc, Smith v Faf. Its all very intriguing.
The Aussies have gone with Peter Siddle as their third paceman because of his experience at Perth, and against the Proteas, leaving Joe Mennie to carry the drinks.
This is a good move by the hosts for various reasons, not least of which is that Mennie was taken apart by most of these SA batsmen in the demolition of an ODI series recently.
The Proteas may have an edge in the bowling department in that their third paceman is Kagiso Rabada, the prodigy who has grown into his role superbly despite his young age.
Will the Proteas play a spinner That is the question. The Aussies always pick Nathan Lyon, no matter the deck, so the visitors should pick either Tabraiz Shamsi or Keshav Maharaj to debut. But will they go with Morne Morkels pace instead
The Aussies have the edge when it comes to opening batsmen. David Warner and Shaun Marsh are both in excellent form, while SAs Stephen Cook has not found his feet Down Under yet.
And finally, all eyes will be on the players behaviour, with the ICC cracking down on banter in the middle, though we still expect a fiery encounter.
Squads
Australia (XI confirmed): David Warner, Shaun Marsh, Usman Khawaja, Steven Smith (captain), Adam Voges, Mitchell Marsh, Peter Nevill (wk), Mitchell Starc, Peter Siddle, Josh Hazlewood, Nathan Lyon.
South Africa: Faf du Plessis, Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Stephen Cook, Quinton de Kock, JP Duminy, Dean Elgar, Keshav Maharaj, Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander, Kagiso Rabada, Rilee Rossouw, Tabraiz Shamsi, Dale Steyn, Dane Vilas.
