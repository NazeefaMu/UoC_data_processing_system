BMICH Offers an Exciting and Dynamic Environment
An architectural jewel among Colombos celebrated landmarks, the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) provides a unique setting for a wide spectrum of events.
Recognised as one of the largest and most versatile event venues in Colombo, its balance of tradition and modernity offers organizers a location for a range of activities beyond conferences or exhibitions.
We have a variety of 16 venues to choose from, spread across 42 acres, each to suit individual or organisational needs, BMICH Manager Events & Reservations Mahesh Amarasinghe noted. For many, the BMICH is prominent as a reputed, conference, convention and exhibition center hosting prestigious seminars, conferences, convocations and award ceremonies, and also musical concerts, Amarasinghe added.
However, unlike other Colombo venues, the BMICHs unique identity, authenticity and special aura provide clients with innumerable flexible spaces to host a variety of other events too. With constant attention to detail making the venue even more suited to events of all types and sizes, the BMICH can host events of greater dimension, its a premium location and we foresee an even more progressive future, BMICH Director/Chief Executive Sunil Dissanayake stated.
We are trying to change the perception of people. We can host any event including weddings, kids birthday parties, breakfast meetings even New Years Eve. BMICH management understands the growing demands of visitors, organisers and exhibitors requiring state-of-the-art infrastructure and offers a compelling proposition as a venue. This includes the ability to accommodate 1600 people at a time that no other venue can do, an Orchestra Pit with very sophisticated lighting, sound and acoustics, and advanced equipment for the simultaneous translation of 32 languages, he said.
The four-decade building remains distinct from the rest of Colombos landscape, but harmonious with the citys urban and natural setting. Inside, the fully equipped modern venue offers organisers everything required to host any type of event  from international conventions to huge fashion shows, gala dinners, and even automobile exhibitions
We can host a dinner for two people in Committee Room F to 2000 people in the main Exhibition Hall. Also in terms of parking we can accommodate 2500 vehicles. This is our unique selling point, Amarasinghe stressed. The evolution of services at the BMICH has been continuous and management have earmarked long term strategic plans. We have a lot of outdoor spaces, the Kamatha for example, and now the land at the back we want to make it into a spice garden.
Unknown to many the BMICH provides facilities on par with star class hotels. BMICH has the ability to host even corporate and national day cocktails, associated functions, dinners, luncheons, breakfast meetings, everything that can be held in Hotels (including availability of bed rooms for event organizers if they wish to stay in the premises during the event) can be hosted here and the biggest advantage is the ample space available for parking which has become quite an issue at most other venues, he said.
The BMICH is also ideal for hosting pre and post media briefings and press conferences, That is something that we do and offer competitive packages for corporate and organisers including at concessionary rates if the main event is held here, Amarasinghe noted.
Additionally, organisers can rely on the experience and professionalism of the in-house team including the catering partner responding to the highest standards, ensuring effective and competitive solutions in making any event, flawless and unforgettable.

IS faces budget crunch, killing perks and slashing salaries
LEBANON: Faced with a cash shortage in its so-called caliphate, ISIS has slashed salaries across the region, asked Raqqa residents to pay utility bills in black market American dollars, and is now releasing detainees for a price of $500 a person.
The extremists who once bragged about minting their own currency are having a hard time meeting expenses, thanks to coalition airstrikes and other measures that have eroded millions from their finances since last fall. Having built up loyalty among militants with good salaries and honeymoon and baby bonuses, the group has stopped providing even the smaller perks: free energy drinks and Snickers bars.
Necessities are dwindling in its urban centres, leading to shortages and widespread inflation, according to exiles and those still suffering under its rule. Interviews gathered over several weeks included three exiles with networks of family and acquaintances still in the group's stronghold in Raqqa, residents in Mosul, and analysts who say ISIS is turning to alternative funding streams, including in Libya.
In Raqqa, the group's stronghold in Syria, salaries have been halved since December, electricity is rationed, and prices for basics are spiralling out of reach, according people exiled from the city.
"Not just the militants. Any civil servant, from the courts to the schools, they cut their salary by 50 percent," said a Raqqa activist now living in the Turkish city of Gaziantep, who remains in close contact with his native city. But that apparently wasn't enough close the gap for a group that needs money to replace weapons lost in airstrikes and battles, and pays its fighters first and foremost. Those two expenses account for two-thirds of its budget, according to an estimate by Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a researcher with the Middle East Forum who sources IS documents.
Within the last two weeks, the extremist group started accepting only dollars for "tax" payments, water and electric bills, according to the Raqqa activist, who asked to be identified by his nom de guerre Abu Ahmad for his safety. "Everything is paid in dollars," he said. His account was bolstered by another ex-Raqqa resident, who, like Ahmad, also relies on communications with a network of family and acquaintances still in the city.
Al-Tamimi came across a directive announcing the fighters' salary cuts in Raqqa: "On account of the exceptional circumstances the Islamic State (IS) is facing, it has been decided to reduce the salaries that are paid to all mujahedeen by half, and it is not allowed for anyone to be exempted from this decision, whatever his position." Those circumstances include the dramatic drop in global prices for oil - once a key source of income - airstrikes that have targeted cash stores and oil infrastructure, supply line cuts, and crucially, the Iraqi government's decision to stop paying civil servants in territory controlled by the extremists.
A Russian-backed Syrian government offensive in Aleppo province, where ISIS controls major towns including Manbij, Jarablus and al-Bab, is also putting pressure on ISIS. Government troops and allied militiamen have advanced toward the town, considered an ISIS bastion, leading many militants to send their families to Raqqa.
An exile from al-Bab said low-level fighters there have begun to grumble, and townspeople have overheard IS officials discussing crippling airstrikes on oil infrastructure in Syria and Iraq and the cutoff of supply lines and revenue sources. The resident, who asked only that his first name Oussama be used because he still has family in the city, said dozens of residents of al-Bab have fled, ignoring orders from the extremists.
"You can sense the frustration, their morale is down," Oussama said of the fighters.
A former Raqqa resident now living in Beirut said Syrians abroad are sending remittances in dollars to cover skyrocketing prices for vegetables and sugar. The resident, whose wife and baby still live in the city, did not want his name used for their safety. One of the other ex-residents, now living in Gaziantep, Turkey, said the road to Mosul was cut off late last year, and prices have risen swiftly - gas is up 25 per cent, meat up nearly 70 per cent, and sugar prices have doubled.
In Iraq, where ISIS has slowly been losing ground over the past year, the Iraqi government in September cut off salaries to government workers within territory controlled by the extremists, after months of wavering about the humanitarian costs paid by those trapped in the region.

Feat feet!
Q: Is a pedicure necessary for beautiful toe nails
A: There is no doubt that a regular pedicure is necessary to keep your nails clean and to maintain them in a presentable manner. Nails say a lot about a person.
Q: Are there any health benefits linked with a pedicure
A: Like anything associated with cleanliness, looking after your nails would make sure that fungal infections etc. are greatly minimized.
Fungal infections are common issues associated with nails.
Q: How often should one have a pedicure
A: A regular pedicure once every 3 to 4 weeks is recommended.
Q: What is the difference between a regular pedicure and a spa pedicure
A: A regular pedicure is associated with maintaining toe nails by cleaning, trimming, pushing cuticles, ensuring good shape, getting rid of dead skin on feet, filing, buffing etc. A spa pedicure includes all these and much more pampering treatments for your feet. It also takes much longer and is costlier. A spa pedicure which is one that you pamper your feet, could be compared to a facial which pampers your face!
Q: What is the most popular form of pedicure and why do clients go for it
A: Both the regular and spa pedicures are popular for different reasons. Spa pedicure is much more specialized and luxurious. It is good to have one when you could find the time and can afford it.
Q: What is nail polish strengthener and why is it used
A: Weakening of nails occur due to different reasons including health and aging.
A nail polish strengthener assists in such cases. There are two basic types of strengtheners, hardeners and hydrators. You need to know the pros and cons of each and pick the one right for you.
You could then make sure that the weak nails get strengthened. In the case of hardeners there is a cross linking hardener and a reinforcing hardener and here too the right one should be selected.
Make sure that you do not get your nails too hard at which point it can become brittle and unable to bend.
If this happens the nail can break more easily.
Q: Does spraying hairspray on fingernails help to dry nail polish faster
A: It is believed that hair spray helps to dry nail polish faster but I would not recommend it as a habit. It is best to use a quick dry which is specially made for that.
Q: Does buffing make your nails shine What are the negatives
A: Many people try buffing natural nails for a healthy shine. This must not be overdone.
It is not good to use buffers daily and I wouldn't recommend it weekly either since it is a risks which makes nails thinner and thinner.
Excessive buffing is said to produce heat as well which makes the nail surface brittle and prone to chipping. If you must, once a month should be alright to fix chipped nails and other emergencies. However you must not be rough. Be very careful with your nails. Also remember that if you have healthy moisturized nails, they will have a good natural shine without any mechanical buffer.

Q: Is giving yourself a pedicure at home safe
A: A general procedure of trimming, filing, cleaning, buffing and coloring at home is fine, provided that you are careful but I would recommend a trained professional for cuticle pushing and any other complicated procedure which may injure your cuticle. Overdoing of buffing too must be avoided.
Q: Is it possible for an individual to get a toe infection several days after a pedicure
A: This cannot be ruled out and that is why professionals should make sure that equipment and instruments are properly sterilized before being used on each client.
Q: Do men go for pedicures
A: Manicures and pedicures are very popular amongst men now. It is not vanity but just well being.
Q: What length is best for nails
A: I always recommend having toe nails short and avoid having long pointed ones. Make sure that all your finger nails are of equal length and your toe nails too are of equal length. As for finger nails, I am not a fan of having long ones and believe medium length is ideal.
Q: Tips to ensure healthy nails.
A: Eat healthy. Keeps nails dry so that fungus does not set in beneath them. Use moisturizer and a cuticle cream daily. Do not use nails as tools. Do not bite and damage them. Cleanliness is important.
Q: Tip to make a pedicure last longer.
A: Avoid wearing covered shoes until 24 hours after applying nail colour.

India the team to beat in World T20
MUMBAI: Twenty20 series wins over Australia and Sri Lanka have given top-ranked India plenty of cause for optimism as they launch their bid for a second world crown in the sport's shortest format on home soil next month.
Champions in the inaugural edition of the World Twenty20 in 2007, India blanked hosts Australia 3-0 at the start of the year before returning home to rally for a 2-1 win over Sri Lanka.
The three-match series started with a surprise defeat on a seamer-friendly surface in Pune but India were spared the usual outpouring of discontent that follows any cricketing loss with convincing wins in the remaining two matches.
A green-tinged pitch like the one witnessed in Pune is unlikely to seen during the March 8-April 3 event and captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni has already identified his preferred 11 a month before the hosts open their campaign against New Zealand.
"We are always a top contender when it comes to shorter formats," Dhoni said after India beat Sri Lanka by nine wickets in Visakhapatnam on Sunday.
"Also, with the World Cup to be held in India, we know the spinners will come into the equation. It gives us the added benefit.
"Added to that is the exposure of having played the IPL (T20 tournament) over here. Out of the eight seasons, we have played seven seasons in India.
"We have got a lot of players, especially ones who are part of the team, who have got very good experience of playing in India."
The return of batting mainstay Virat Kohli, rested for the Sri Lanka series, for Ajinkya Rahane is likely to be the only change to India's starting side for the upcoming Asia Cup T20 event in Bangladesh and the subsequent World Twenty20.
The strong form of India's top order has left the middle to lower batsmen with limited opportunities to impress, however, and while Dhoni would like to see that deficiency addressed, he realises it could be difficult to fulfil.
"Not everybody has had a chance to bat but we will keep facing this problem because our line-up is quite deep," Dhoni added.
"We will try to give chances to a few of the players who haven't batted so far. But usually those who are batting close to six, seven and eight will have to develop ways to play the big shots as soon as they go in anyway."
Dhoni, who led the side to that victory in 2007 and also the 50-over World Cup on home soil four years later, was more relaxed about his bowling options, saying the side had the right balance to tackle any conditions.

Kandy SC keep clean sheet, but only just
Kandy Sports Club continued to maintain their unbeaten record when they gained a hard fought win over CR and FC on Sunday in Kandy. This was a second round encounter and like the first round it was a very close game.
Kandy SC did not have things their own way. It was their superior speed and better handling of the ball in the back division that brought them victory. The winners pocketed 15 points to the loser's 12.
Kandy SC took the field a depleted side without six of their regulars and had to fight hard to record their 12th consecutive win of the season. The brave CR and FC ruggerites came very near to creating the season's biggest upset and walked out of the ground with their heads held high. They shocked everyone by stretching Kandy SC to the limit.
CR and FC created huge pressure with territorial advantage gaining around 75% possession but lacked the finishing touches that led them to this defeat. In the second half CR and FC had more possession but lacked penetration to convert it into points due to many unforeseen errors.
CR three quarters had a poor game as they missed several opportunities of scoring. They had the momentum of scoring on several occasions but failed. Actually CR had only them to blame for the loss.
Kandy SC's acting skipper and scrum half Roshan Weerartne was the architect of their victory. His good passes, perfect dummying split the CR and FC defence. Whatever said and done the defending champions found scoring difficult owing to the plucky display by the Red shirts.
The very large gathering present was caught in a tense atmosphere for a major portion of the game, as the rugby what they expected did not emerge. Don't blame the referee; blame the players who failed to give their best.

Rocket launch shows N.Korea does not want peace: South Korean President
KOREA: South Korean President Park Geun-hye pledged on Tuesday further "strong" measures against North Korea, after suspending operations at a jointly run industrial park as punishment for the North's recent long-range rocket launch and nuclear test.
It was time to face the "uncomfortable truth" that the North would not change, Park said in comments that mark a significant reversal for a leader whose policy on Pyongyang had been based on what she'd described as "trustpolitik" that she hoped would lay the ground for eventual unification. Park said past efforts at engagement had not worked. "It has become clear that the existing approach and goodwill are not going to break the North Korean regime's nuclear development drive," she told Parliament. Washington and Seoul are seeking support from Beijing, Pyongyang's main ally, for tougher sanctions against North Korea for the Feb. 7 rocket launch and January's nuclear test.
"The premise of 'trustpolitik' was that the North was a partner. The president's comments in effect mean that premise was wrong. It is a complete turnabout in North Korea policy," said Hong Sung-gul, a political science professor at Kookmin University.
South Korea last week suspended the operation of the Kaesong industrial zone, which had been run jointly with the North for more than a decade. The industrial park was a key source of hard currency for the impoverished North. Seoul also agreed to enter talks with Washington for deploying a missile defense system in South Korea, which China strongly opposes.
"The government will take strong and effective measures for the North to come to the bone-numbing realization that nuclear development will not help its survival but rather it will only speed up the collapse of the regime," Park said.
She did not specify what the measures would involve. Seoul and Washington have said the rocket launch was in fact a long-range missile test that violated U.N. Security Council resolutions. The North said the launch was part of its scientific program designed to launch satellites into space.
Park, whose father ruled South Korea for 18 years, had set out an ambitious plan early in her single five-year term to prepare the two Koreas for unification. That, and her call for confidence-building steps between the rivals, were a departure from the hard-line policy of her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak.
In a 2014 speech in Germany that became known as the "Dresden declaration", Park called for a new push for cooperation and exchange to bring the two societies closer. She hoped Germany's reunification would eventually be emulated on the Korean peninsula.
Park had sought to engage the North in dialogue since then, while also responding firmly to moves by North Korea that raised tensions, including a landmine blast at the border last year that wounded two South Korean soldiers.
Her top national security officials met senior aides to the North's young leader, Kim Jong Un, in August and agreed to take steps to improve ties in the most substantial diplomatic engagement since a 2007 summit between the Koreas. Those efforts have since fizzled.
South Korea is now on heightened alert for any kind of "extreme actions" Pyongyang might take, Park said.
South Korea's Defense Ministry has said upcoming annual joint military drills with U.S. forces would be the largest ever. Seoul has been in talks with Washington to deploy U.S. strategic assets on the Korean peninsula, such as stealth bombers and a nuclear-powered submarine.

[Up & Under]
Rugby can learn a lot from cricket
Cricket has cracked a World Cup after much pain and achievement purely on the skill and talent naturally born around this bountiful island. We have broken that imposing psychological barrier of being intimidated by other international teams ....we hold our own and the luxury of putting pressure before competition. This is a luxury of reputation based on skill and pure achievement.
Rugby has a few steps on this platform ...and the luxury label of a warrior belief and respected for their dedication and passion. We can learn bloodlines from the impressive Fijian, Samoan, Tongan and ultimate warriors ...the New Zealand All Blacks ...champions in all formats of the international game.
The heart for more...the mind to be relentless and an attitude in training mind and body ...that goes beyond conventional human beings. Does SRi have those warrior hearts to go beyond ...a question I asked the All Blacks guru of 7s Sir Gordon Titjens - 19 yrs coaching NZ ...and easily the best the world has ever seen. A win record that is jealously guarded including World Cup current champs ...Commonwealth Games champs, World Series 7s most consistent winners since it started. Sir Gordon or Titjh ...has been there and continues the legend in 2016...long may he reign.
Dialog league
A weekend of agonising score lines that speak of team mentality and endurance. Kandy nearly playing into CR's hands much to the shock and disbelief of the Nittawela faithful. The first round nearly upset the unbeaten tag ...round 2 was a closer finish ...Kandy surviving 15/12 to relief and a note to the rugby chairman Lasantha to have space cleared in their trophy cabinet.
Coincidentally all the matches right down to the wire ...tantalizing conclusions that could have swung either way till the final whistle.
Army-Navy 32/35..the sailors nearly sinking despite the on field effort, especially the Navy forwards ...Army have themselves to blame this weekend too.
Havies v Police...The much improved Police also stepped up with Reza Mubarak, Rehan Weerakoon, and no 8 Radeesha Seneviratne who had a storm...hounding in defence and lethal in attack; final score - 27/24 to Havelocks. Havies certainly missing Niroshan Fernando...Dulaj Perera and Danushka Ranjan ...on injury recovery.
The league all wrapped up: 1. Kandy 67points. 2. Havelocks 59. 3. CR 47. 4. Navy 41.5. Police 31. All hail the Dialog league!
Rugby nation in radar
St Peter's honoured its sons at a glittering ceremony at the college hall ...rugby honours on national caps Danushka Ranjan, Dulaj Perera, Lee Keegal, and Ishan Noor. Big hand to all and much credit to coaching staff and the SPC old boys rugby foundation.
The U18 schools 7s successfully grabbed the attention and a platform for skills showcased ...defending champs Science College narrowly beating an inspired and much improved Trinity side 12/5 in the final. Eyes on for Trinity and their performance this season in all formats. Big hand to Science and a *7s reputation that grows with intensity.
If the game demands warriors in the middle ...it also demands support and facilities for conditioning and preparation. The practical thinking sometimes a little short on sense and more on sensation and massive pressure to resort to supplements as food and nutrition alternatives.
My humble opinion ...not an expert but as a former player and knowledge gained from survival on the world stage - keep it natural, trust the normal food groups, increase the volume of consumption and frequency of snacks...eat healthy fuel for mind and body, work on the major proteins good carbs: and necessary fat ...a balance is the ultimate key.
The mind to play this game separates the warrior from ordinary men and women. ...an honour to represent your badge ....The privilege to play for school, club and eventually your country. This honour is singular and distinct ... it's a reputation for life and a badge of rugby courage worn through life. Blessings to all those who have worn those colours and played against the world champions without much hesitation.
Sri Lanka's rugby history is a list of such warriors and gladiators from its earliest days ...wishes to all of them and respect for the effort and pride.
Bula bula those special SRi islanders...long may their performance be remembered.

SKYSCRAPERS ARE DEATHTRAPS 
Its never just a fire, if its in a skyscraper, is it It has to be an inferno. Events are always more dramatic when they occur on the 60th floor. And as flames engulfed the 63-storey 5-star Address Downtown Hotel in Dubai this New Years Eve, our worst fears about tall buildings were fuelled once again. Skyscrapers may represent the height of luxury and provide astonishing views, but theyre death traps all the same.
Except that theyre not, actually. Not anymore. With each inferno, earthquake and terrorist attack over the last half century, each new landmark architectural brief, building technology has got better and better. Though comparisons to 70s disaster movies are inevitable, high rise no longer needs to be seen as (to quote Paul Newman) a shrine to all the bull---- in the world, because design has come to the rescue.
Todays tall buildings are no longer just silhouettes on the skyline  they have potential far beyond their panoramic views. Which is good, because with increasing urbanisation, and the rise of the megacity, many of us will likely end up living in one.
When it comes to skyscraper design disaster has been the father of invention. Its thanks to horrific earthquakes in Japan and San Francisco that in any quake today, the 25th floor of a modern skyscraper is one of the safest places to be. While the building sways rather than collapses, you will be kept safe from falling debris and stampedes of panicking people in the street.
Since 9/11 architects and engineers have worked harder than ever to improve fire safety and evacuation possibilities. Where one of the problems in tall buildings has traditionally been access for firefighters, whose hoses will generally only reach 50ft (a high-rise building is defined as anything from 75ft upwards), this is now a major consideration in any new build.
The new Freedom Tower, on the site just north of the Twin Towers, features a dedicated staircase for emergency crews. Pressurised and protected by 3ft concrete walls, it runs through the very core of the building, ensuring firefighters have access enough to tackle the flames in good time.
Dubai, home to more than 900 skyscrapers, as well as the worlds tallest (the 168-storey Burj Khalifa) is also doing its bit to advance the high rise safety cause. The Burj in particular has benefited from post 9/11 innovations with designated refuge areas on each floor where occupants gather in case of fire before taking safe lifts (named lifeboats) down to the ground floor, and the exits.
Despite the toweringinferno in Dubai,there has been adesign revolution inhigh-rise buildings
Later this year too, Dubai is set to introduce a new level of futuristic fire fighting, with flying forces, specially trained and equipped with jetpacks. Designed by New Zealand manufacturer Martin Aircraft Company, the jetpacks not only shoot rescue missions straight to the relevant balcony from outside, but will also manoeuvre heavy equipment and assess heat sources using thermal imaging cameras.
Of course the bad press that skyscrapers encounter is not all misplaced. Greedy developers with a pile em high, sell em at a premium mentality can be identified through any number of empty and odd-looking trophy towers creeping up on the worlds ever-busier city skylines.
But there is good news here too as tall buildings begin to address new problems. Climate change and housing shortages are very real issues that towers can realistically be expected to address  and in the face of them, skyscrapers in the 21st century are beginning to look very different from their predecessors.
Architectural ego wars and overly gilded towers playing top Trumps on the skyline appear both dated and a little pathetic in the face of these innovations and ideas  buildings like CF Mllers woodscraper design for Stockholm, a 34-storey apartment block made from timber.
Wood is taking over from steel and concrete as the architectural wonder material, with cross laminated timber (CLT) in particular being increasingly popular with architects for its sustainability, quality and speed of construction  as well as its safety credentials. (Specially developed coatings combined with proper building regulations can make a wooden apartment building 50 times more fire safe than a similar apartment building made of concrete.)
Or what about a vertical SkyFarm  a proposal by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners developed in response to the 2015 Milan Expo theme feed the world An alternative to the typical land-intensive farming systems, it is designed to produce crops in multistorey structures within high-density urban areas or where there is insufficient land or poor quality soil.
Even more progressive (or outlandish) still, Dutch architects DoepelStrijkers have designed a huge circular wind turbine that doubles as an apartment block, hotel and a rollercoaster.
The Dutch WindWheel is designed to generate more energy than it uses, while also attracting around 1.5 million visitors per year.
Whether it ever gets built well have to see, but when it comes to high-octane architectural drama weve come a long way from infernos. (telegraph.co.uk)

Sports Ministry must act with more responsibility - Arjuna Ranatunga
"Sports officials must work with more responsibility to develop sports," said former Test cricket captain and Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga during a ceremony held to felicitate Ports Authority's South Asian Games athletes at the Ports Authority auditorium yesterday. He also pointed out that more than the Sports Minister the responsibilities lies at the hands of sports officials.
"Even under the good governance government some Sports Ministry officials don't carry out their duties properly as they are influenced by money and power," he blamed. Three athletes participated at the SAG from Ports Authority. Janitha Surath (captain - volleyball team), Wasana Madumali (vice captain - women's volleyball team), Nilanka Sanjaya (volleyball) and the women's volleyball assistant coach Kalika Wasanthapriya who helped Sri Lanka to win silver medals in volleyball.
They were awarded cash prizes and service promotions at the ceremony. Twenty-four time national billiards champion K. H. Sirisoma, who is also an employee of Ports Authority was given a service extension and a cash award too. Ranatunga revealed that a separate sports unit will be formed at the Ports Authority soon. "It is always sports clubs, institutions and sports personnel who pay the price for all misconducts of officials. To change this trend sports authority must take the necessary steps," Ranatunga stated.

Trump threatens Cruz with legal action over his Canadian birth
US: Republican Presidential front-runner Donald Trump has threatened to sue his rival Ted Cruz over his eligibility to serve in the White House unless he receives an apology from the Texas Senator for spreading lies about the real estate tycoon's record.
"Ted Cruz is a totally unstable individual. He is the single biggest liar I've ever come across, in politics or otherwise, and I have seen some of the best of them. His statements are totally untrue and completely outrageous," Trump said, days ahead of South Carolina's pivotal Republican primary.
In a statement, Trump, 69, threatened to take legal action against Cruz for him being born in Canada and not in the US. The businessman ordered Cruz to retract statements about his past inconsistencies on abortion rights and other social issues. Trump also demanded that the senator from Texas take down advertisements attacking him.
"It is hard to believe a person who proclaims to be a Christian could be so dishonest and lie so much," he said. "Cruz has become unhinged and is lying with the hopes that his statements will go unchecked until after the election and he will save his failing campaign," Trump alleged.
"If Ted is going to continue to lie with such desperation, I have no choice but to fight back," he adding that one of the ways he can fight back is to bring a lawsuit against him relative to the fact that he was born in Canada and therefore cannot be President. "If he doesn't take down his false ads and retract his lies, I will do so immediately," Trump said.
Cruz, 45, fired back, claiming that he is simply pointing out Trump's actual positions. "You cannot simply scream 'liar' when someone points out your actual positions," he tweeted.
The Texas Senator said he won't engage in personal attacks, but will continue to focus on his competitor's records, policies and vision.
The Florida Senator Marco Rubio also attacked Cruz and accused him of lying. "Senator Cruz will say or do anything to win an election including employing underhanded tactics and making charges against all his opponents that he knows are outright lies. America can't afford more politicians like Ted Cruz who will easily sacrifice principle for political gain," said Joe Pounder, Rubio spokesman.

## Title: "We'll need a dozen Mathews and Kimikos to win an Asian medal"

"We'll need a dozen Mathews and Kimikos to win an Asian medal"
Sri Lanka's celebrated swim star and three-time Olympian Julian Bolling said the country will need "at least a dozen Mathews and Kimikos" if they are to win an Asian Games medal in swimming within the next decade.
Referring to Mathew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem, who won seven and five gold medals respectively in swimming at the recently concluded Asian Games in Guwahati, India, the former Sri Lanka swimmer turned coach insisted on a concrete program to groom next generation swimmers with sufficient international exposure.
A proud product of Royal College, Colombo, Bolling has been the most successful swimmer that Sri Lanka has ever produced, accounting for a record 15 South Asian Games gold medals, including five in his last of four appearances in 1991.
The head coach of Rainbow Aquatics and the Director of the Rainbow Swimming Academy, Bolling had the rare honour of representing Sri Lanka at three Olympic Games - in Los Angeles in 1984 as a schoolboy, as well as at the 1988 and 1992 Barcelona Games. During his illustrious career as a celebrated Lankan swimmer, Bolling has made it to six finals in his two Asian Games appearances.
Here are excerpts from an interview:
Q: It has been 25 long years since you set a new record with five gold medals at the Vth South Asian Games in Colombo. How do you look back at that performance and the country's progress in swimming since then
A: We are happy that we have won 12 gold medals in swimming at the recent South Asian Games. But medals are not records. Records are achieved through better timings. Hence, it's the performance that matters if we are to talk about the country's overall standards in swimming.
The gold medal we won in relay at the 1991 South Asian Games was the greatest achievement for me because that speaks volumes of the country's standards in swimming. Medals won in swimming at the last South Asian Games are nothing to do with national plans but purely due to the individual brilliance Mathew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem and the investments made by their parents coupled by proper guidance.
Q: What are your observations on planning and achieving higher standards in Sri Lanka swimming
A: Zero! There has not been any collective effort or a plan to go for it. I was abroad when I was preparing for 1991 South Asian Games but I was told that we had a well-knit plan.
It's very simple in any trade, be it sports, tourism or any other sphere. If we don't plan anything properly and make hard preparations, you cannot achieve anything. Overall, we should not be overjoyed and it was not a great result at the Games. Of course we could feel happy that we were ahead of Pakistan and Bangladesh in the final overall medals table at the last SA Games.
There was a huge contingent that went for the Games in India and if the two gold medal-winning swimmers had not participated, our gold haul would have been slashed by half. Hence, we need a solid plan to develop the sport.
Q: How do you analyze the performance of Mathew Abeysinghe and Kimiko Raheem who shared 12 swimming gold medals between them
A: Very interesting! Their timings are very good. I have not compared the last Asian Games timings with their performance. But they may be able to make it at least to the finals of the next Asian Games, provided they improve on their timings further.
Q: Sri Lanka won 12 gold medals in swimming at the last SA Games, that's 25 years after you and Dipika Chanmugam shared equal number of golds in 1991. Does that mean that our swimming had regained its lost glory or do you see an overall decline in South Asian standards
A: We could analyze it in two ways. One is our performance at the 2016 SA Games is much better than we did at the previous games in 2010 where we were placed only fourth in the overall medals table. At least we are ahead of Pakistan and Bangladesh now.
However, I don't think the overall standard of Sri Lanka sport has improved. At the last Asian Games, a non-Olympic sport such as cricket had to come to Sri Lanka's rescue to win a solitary gold and silver medal.
We have hardly invested on next generation of athletes. Some of our athletes who had eventually won gold medals in India had to stay in temples when they were competing at the trials before the Games. That was very unfortunate.
Q: What are your main suggestions to develop Olympic sport in Sri Lanka
A: Basically, I have two key suggestions which I consider to be essential to produce results at international level. Firstly, we need to construct a 400-bed hostel in Colombo for sportsmen and women to stay when they come for competition and training. If not, they would be compelled to look for makeshift accommodation in places such as temples as they did at the last athletic trials in Homagama.
We could have tolerated if that had happened 40 years ago. But definitely not in an era like this when we talk about intensive training for the big league.
Unless we construct such hostel facilities for national level sportsmen and women, no authority could boast that they had done so much for the development of sport.
Secondly, we need a foreign consultant to take care of high performance training of our top sportsmen and women. Why we need a foreign expert is because that nobody could then hoodwink or get undue advantages, be it political or otherwise. If we do that we could sail again.
Q:Are you happy with the progress made by the national body for aquatic sport - the Sri Lanka Aquatic Sports Union
A: We are now working with a new federation which has a set of properly elected officials at the last AGM. I don't hold any official position but I support them in the development and promotion of the sport, especially in the outstations. There is so much of raw talent in the outstations and we need to tap them at the right time and groom them carefully for the future.
Q: Is there any hope for Sri Lanka swimmers to go beyond South Asian level Do you think that we could win an Asian Games swimming medal at least within the next decade or so
A: India, being a country with a huge population, has produced just two bronze medals at the last two Asian Games. But they had made a lot of effort and hard training for eight years to achieve that.
In China and Japan, there are two world class set of swimmers competing at Asian Games. It is a gigantic task to challenge their superiority. Nevertheless, we could focus on an Asian Games medal if we make a lot of hard effort.
In order to achieve that, we need a lot of money to fund intensive training and international exposure in competition. If we work on a concrete plan and make an investment for the future, it would not be a distant dream.
However, we need a dozen of Mathews and Kimikos if we are to embark on an ambitious program to win an Asian Games medal.
Q: Personally, what have you been doing in recent times
A: I was in Kandy this week for a three-day workshop for 'Better Fathers at Home'. I feel most fathers are not taking their rightful place at homes.
We try to attract their attention to play that vital role. We train different sets of trainers and in return they would go back to their respective stations and make our fathers aware of their responsibilities. We plan a similar workshop in Galle next week.
Q: Finally, what is your advice to those taking to swimming
A: Create a passion for it and work hard with dedication. Enjoy the sport and make it a lifestyle!
