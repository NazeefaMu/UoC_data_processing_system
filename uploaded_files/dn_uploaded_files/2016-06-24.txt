Now and Forever Richard Marx in Colombo
Few entrants in the ruthlessly competitive American music industry can boast of a personal summons by the great Lionel Ritchie himself  which is how Richard Marx got into the music industry. The story goes that some of Marxs demo tapes had found their way in to Ritchies hands. Ritchie liked them so much he suggested that Marx should come over to LA. Richard Marx did just that - starting off by doing background vocals for Ritchies solo Album Cant Slow Down.
Four decades, 30 million records and 13 incandescent hit singles later, Richard Marx continues to thrill audiences with his 80s angst driven acoustic ballads such as Now and Forever  which incidentally he wrote for his long time wife and mother of his three children, actress Cynthia Rhodes (Dirty Dancing and Flashdance). His other mega hits include soft rock classics such as the iconic Right Here Waiting for You and Endless Summer Nights. While his deft piano work, songwriting skills and edgy vocals has led him to be called the Billy Joel of the Midwest, as a savvy producer his velvet sound production has seen Marx pick some great winners. He has produced for heavy weights such as Keith Urban, Luther Van Ross, Josh Groban and Barbara Streisand as well as for his Hollywood buddy Hugh Jackman.
The slightly melancholic and impassioned Richard Marxs ballads became twilight favorites of 80s and 90s Sri Lankan dance parties. Much to the delight of his numerous Sri Lankan fans, Richard Marx will be performing for audiences in Colombo at the Stein Studios on June 26.
The Richard Marx Concert, a Yes FM and Legends FM event is presented by Fairway Holdings. Fairway Holdings as a company which understands the importance of a vibrant cultural life in a modern metropolis, always strives to enrich the contemporary lifestyles of Sri Lanka by enabling iconic international artists to perform here.

Third force doomed: Wijithamuni
There is no place for a third political force in the present political environment that exists in the country today. Anyone trying to form a third political force against all odds will be relegated to political oblivion, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Soysa said.
He was addressing the SLFP weekly press briefing at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headquarters yesterday.
The Minister added that after the formation of the SLFP by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, no third political force has been successful.
The Minister noted that the SLFP is driven forward only with the decisions taken at the SLFP Central Committee and not the personal views of anyone. There are alternative views within the SLFP but the party is taken forward with the decisions taken at the Central Committee. When asked whether former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not guilty of financial misconducts as stated by Cabinet Spokesman Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, the Minister said even though Mahinda Rajapaksa has not committed financial misconduct, the persons who were with him are responsible for various forms of irregularities and frauds.
I personally believe that Mahinda is not a thief. But it can be said that his family members and persons who were with him have committed financial fraud and misconduct, he said. Speaking on the next local government election he said that the SLFP is ready to face the forthcoming local government election.
