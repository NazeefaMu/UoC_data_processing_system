Bangladeshs Shahadat bailed in child maid abuse case: lawyer
Dhaka, Tuesday: Bangladesh Test cricketer Shahadat Hossain was granted bail Tuesday after being detained over allegations of beating a child maid, a prosecution lawyer said. The countrys court bailed Shahadat until March 31 but deputy attorney general Moniruzzaman Kabir said his office was preparing to lodge an appeal to the supreme court.
The High Court has accepted Shahadats bail plea today after it was earlier rejected by the lower court, Kabir, the representative of the alleged 11-year-old victim, told AFP.
Shahadat, who has played 38 Tests for Bangladesh, has been in custody since October 5 when he handed himself into police, a day after his wife Nritto Shahadat was arrested in the same case. She was granted bail last week.
Both face charges of assaulting a child and employing a minor. The couple went into hiding after police raided their house in September as their maid was found crying on a street in the capital Dhaka.

Beaten Rousey faces up to six months out
Los Angeles, Tuesday: Fallen UFC world champion Ronda Rousey has revealed it could take up to six months to fully recover from injuries sustained in her brutal knockout defeat to Holly Holm last month.
Rousey told the upcoming edition of ESPN Magazine she had suffered damage to her teeth in the stunning loss to Holm which would prevent her getting back in the octagon for several months.
It might be three to six months before I can eat an apple, let alone take an impact, Rousey said in brief excerpts of the interview released Monday.
Rouseys defeat to Holm in Melbourne was one of the biggest shocks in the history of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.
Both fighters have expressed optimism for a rematch once Rousey has recovered and fulfilled several longstanding commitments including filming a Hollywood remake of the 1980s movie Road House.
Rousey, 28, meanwhile insisted that despite the disappointment of the defeat she planned on returning to reclaim her crown while she remained in peak physical condition. Maybe I cant do it all before my prime, before my body is done, Rousey said. But... maybe I can. AFP

CCC happy to partner CIC
The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce is dedicated to lend a helping hand to the SME sector to realise its vast potential, says Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) Chairman Samantha Ranatunga, who is also the Managing Director of CIC Holdings.
The CCC is the apex body of business in Sri Lanka, being the oldest business chamber in the country. In short, it is the oldest trade organisation in the land. It is a great asset for business and industry in the country and a very significant player in the economy. I know how valuable the CCC is, because I have been a beneficiary [of its good work] before becoming an office bearer. The CIC, where I have worked for 25 years now, has benefitted greatly from the CCC and this is true for almost every company in the country, said Ranatunga, explaining the CCCs role in a nutshell in an interview with the Daily News.
This is why I thought of joining the CCC and playing an active role in it. With our wide network of regional chambers and nearly 8,400 institutions who are our stakeholders directly and indirectly, we play a multitude of roles in influencing policy. Our role in dealing with larger organisations is rather well known, but what is less well known is our work in rural areas and with SMEs. We want to be known for our role in championing the small holders. There are a lot of inputs that the SMEs can get from the larger organisations, we want to make it happen. It is challenging work, but it is our heart and soul, says Ranatunga.

I would call the CCC the main taproot of the economy. We have broadbased over the last 176 years to be relevant to everyone, to all stakeholders. We have a constant engagement with the policymakers. Ours is an independent view of what is right for the countrys business and economy. We are a key influence driver. We want a bigger interaction with the authorities. We are a broader platform for a better dialogue and consultation with policymakers, explained Ranatunga.
We always had a solid platform of understanding with the Government and policymakers. We want that platform to be strengthened which will be better for investment. We want a better dialogue with the policymakers. We have a perception of national priorities and from the policymakers side, we are always keen to know what their priorities are. Then we can play an even more meaningful role in developing the national economy. Consistency of policy is very important for national development. Countries which have had consistency in policy have done extremely well while countries with inconsistent policies have suffered even with vast resources. There should be consistent policies for national priorities such education and economy. If there is consistency, economies can do well.
Ranatunga advocates policies that wont change across governments at least for key sectors such as health, education, SME, social welfare and regional development. He expressed optimism on this score, since the previous and new governments were both basically aligned on the issue of economic policies.
Noting the Governments avowed goal to increase exports to US$ 50 billion, Ranatunga said there should be a bigger focus on the services sector including education, the knowledge economy and reskilling the people. We have to redefine how we look at this issue. We have no more land, so we basically have to look at sectors that can expand. We have to go the next level of exports. The service sector has to be expanded. We have to look at our skills base and move up the line with the knowledge economy. We have to think about reskilling our peoples skills. We also have to bear in mind that we are no longer a country with the cheapest labour. Neither do we have a good knowledge economy - we have to realign that to match the rest of the world.
Ranatunga seeks enhanced moves to bring Sri Lankans domiciled abroad who will be an invaluable asset in terms of moving towards the knowledge economy. At the moment we are just skimming the surface. For industries like BPO, we do not have the numbers or the scale. But we have to leverage on sectors where we have scale, such as accountancy where we have some of the best people globally.
When we have a good skills base, we can be involved in global knowledge outsourcing. If we channel that knowledge into areas where we can process that knowledge, it will benefit the country.
Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC)
Chairman Samantha Ranatunga
This move will have a positive impact on the economy.
Ranatunga expressed the hope that with the new consensual trends in local politics, the people and the business community could expect a higher level of maturity in policy making. We must applaud maturity in politics whenever we see it, build the momentum and ensure its continuity for the progress of the nation.
Ranatunga points out that our thinking patterns must change to reflect the needs of the times. For example, there should be risk-based lending for ideas. Banks are used to requiring collateral. One basically cannot go the bank with a good [business] idea and seek financial help. But these should change.
Ranatunga notes that several leading Sri Lankan companies were at the cutting edge of their business in terms of technical prowess, sustainability and innovativeness. Their enterprising spirit has helped Sri Lanka to survive the loss of GSP Plus and the global economic downturn. These companies have kept on growing. But we cannot go on forever with a few big companies sharing the burden. Look at Vietnam which does US$ 130 billion exports, Singapore does US$ 500 billion. We should not think of US$ 50 billion as an impossible number. We can do it. If Vietnam can do it, why cannot we  We need such positive thinking and attitudes. We have to understand our problems and go for solutions.
Ranatunga enthuses that Sri Lanka can do a lot more to attract world class employers on a platform of investor friendliness. We have to get skilled people and multinationals here. We must become a preferred destination for them. We have to educate the people to become competitive. We have to improve on these shortcomings to improve the economy. The Chamber will strive to increase the standards of education in subjects related to business. We will do this to empower rural youth on par with urban youth. It will not only provide the industrial sector with skilled personnel, it will also help the rural youth to do better and advance in their chosen careers.
Having been an employee of CIC Holdings for well over two decades, agriculture is a subject close to Ranatungas heart. Agriculture is the problem child of the economy. It is still dependent on subsidies and handouts with no linkage towards productivity. The fertilizer subsidy alone costs Rs.50 billion to 60 billion which is 30 percent of what we totally spent on education in 2014. We have to rethink subsidies, perhaps give them in terms of output. That will reward productivity. The land available for agriculture is getting smaller. We have to utilize more technology to increase yields and productivity. There must be more responsible farming. More youth must be attracted to farming. 
He lamented that only a few companies such as CIC were engaged in large-scale agriculture, with several companies literally leaving the field soon after entering it. One problem is that most companies do not see big returns, they see the [price, weather etc] fluctuations and how it can affect their revenue streams, so they think it is too risky. This calls for a rethink on how we perceive farming. We have to reskill more people for farming. Today, the average farmer wears the badge of poverty with pride and is generally described in the newspapers as a poor farmer. But it should not be the case. There are many farmers who earn Rs.3 to 4 million per season, but some of them want to stay under the radar without paying taxes and do not want to declare their income. They thrive in the non-entity form but we have to turn them into bigger entrepreneurs to take agriculture to the next level.
Agriculture or any other business, Ranatunga says, calls for a lot of research. He cites CIC as a prime example for a company which takes Research and Development on its own and with universities very seriously given the role it plays in the economy. Ranatunga calls for a better dissemination of knowledge from all universities and questions why only few local universities are engaged in research.
Ranatunga is a passionate advocate for skills development in the populace at all levels. We must begin this journey now. If we have more work skills, opportunities will come from local and foreign investors. There are many wrong notions about arts graduates, for example, but there are those who might need their writing skills. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is crucial. We must create a proper macroeconomic environment and have more investor friendly policies to attract more investors along with good governance, transparency and stable political systems. We have the ingredients to attract investments. We have to make the Board of Investment (BoI) more dynamic. Our policies too can improve to attract more FDI.
Elaborating on FDI, Ranatunga says Sri Lanka can do much better in terms of FDI thanks to its fantastic location at the heart of the East-West passage and its relatively good infrastructure, logistics, telecom/net connectivity, educated and knowledgeable workforce. There are so many plus points for FDI in Sri Lanka. But we have to reassure the foreign investors that their investments will be protected at all times. That is an essential component. Then there are some other factors such as good governance, socio-political stability and rule of law that most leading investors seek in any country. These must be assured to them regardless of local political developments.
Ranatunga, who has an intimate knowledge of multinational companies, has a better worldview on multinationals than many other business persons. Most people like to bash multinationals, but there are many things we can learn from them, for example research and development, innovation and value for money. They respond to customer needs. Companies like Akzo Nobel (which the CIC represents in Sri Lanka) constantly innovate, have very high safety standards, and their products will give you real value. But from a regulators point of view, there should be better consumer protection, better safeguards and regulations so the consumers or users do not get exploited or duped at any time. It is a two way process.
As for the CIC itself, it is looking at two areas for expansion  one is dairy, where we are looking to expand with Israeli technology to supply the national milk collecting grid. We plan to import high quality livestock genetic material and do embryo transplanting here. We are keen to see an improvement in dairy consumption as well  that is why we went into yogurt. Sri Lankans prefer yogurt to liquid milk, so we want to increase the variety there. Importing and using powdered milk is not viable in the long term. We want to reduce that dependence and we have invested heavily in the dairy sector. We also want to get into high value vegetables for exports using advanced greenhouse technology under a certified responsible farming system. We are also setting up a technology centre in Dambulla to showcase these technologies to farmers.
He is pleased to see more companies getting listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE). We also need more small-time shareholders. It will create more interest among rural investors, who will have a sense of belonging. The listing prices itself leads to more transparency, better governance, better financial reporting. You have to be responsible and accountable on a continuous basis.
Then the confidence of investors will also grow, which can drive the economy to the next level, which is what Sri Lanka really needs at this hour.

Foreign Ministry to take final call on India-Pakistan series
NEW DELHi, Tuesday : In yet another twist, it is now being reported that the India-Pakistan series announcement is likely to be made either today or tomorrow.
According to CNN-IBN, Sushma Swaraj and Sartaz Aziz are likely to make an announcement regarding the series in a joint statement.
Swaraj is in Islamabad to attend the Heart of Asia regional conference.
"We have been informally told that Swaraj will talk on cricket and decide the fate of the series," PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan had earlier told media.
The series, agreed between the two boards in a memorandum of understanding signed last year, ran into trouble amid strained relations over cross-border shelling in disputed Kashmir.
But Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi met on the sidelines of a climate change conference in Paris last week as the two countries seek a thaw in relations.
That informal meeting was followed by "cordial" talks between the Indian and Pakistani national security advisers in Bangkok on Sunday, giving Khan fresh hope the series could yet take place. "The recent meeting between the two prime ministers and security advisers' meeting in Bangkok have hinted the situation between Pakistan and India will improve," he said.
Making arrangements for the series -- which could run from December 17-January 3 -- would be "challenging" at such short notice, Khan said, "but we will do it once we get clearance from the Indian government."

Four teams from India for 12th Nelson Mendis cricket
Four teams from India will be among the 36 participating for supremacy in the 12th Nelson Mendis Challenge Trophy under-14 limited-over cricket championship that will be worked off from December 10 to 22 at 13 venues around Colombo. The tournament is conducted by the CCC School of Cricket with the main sponsorship of Singer Sri Lanka Ltd.
Considered to be the biggest domestic tournament for this age category, the tournament is very popular not only among local cricket schools and academies but also international cricket academies over the years. The CCC School of Cricket was inaugurated in 1998 and the annual tournament was started in 2004. Since then the school earned a name as a leading institution in fostering junior cricket in Sri Lanka.
The mastermind behind the CCC School of Cricket and the tournament, veteran cricket coach Nelson Mendis said: "This tournament has attracted teams from all parts of the country as well as many foreign teams from Australia, Pakistan, New Zealand and India in previous editions. But unfortunately this year a change of domestic seasons and examinations in those countries have prevented their participation.
"Our institution always aims to uplift the standard of school cricket and this tournament paves a good platform for youngsters to showcase their talents while playing with true spirit of the sport. This will open new doors to make new friendships and learn from each other," he said.
"We are very proud to say that our institution so far has produced cricketers who have gone onto represent Sri Lanka 'A', Sri Lanka U-19 and National teams. Madhuri Samuddhika, Dilshan Munaweera, Kusal Perera, Ramith Rambukwella and Ashan Priyanjan have reached National level while Andrie Berenger who represented UAE in the 2015 World Cup was a member of CCC School of Cricket 'Maroon' team which won the Nelson Mendis Trophy in 2005," Mendis noted.
Piliyandala CA, Kolitha CA Thalawathugoda, Colt CA Colombo, Oval CA Colombo, NCC CA Colombo, SA CA Moratuwa, Mighty CA Colombo, Great CA Moneragala, Athula Akkarawita Cricket Training Centre Kotte will mark their debut while teams from Rambukkana, Kurunegala, Madampa, Gampaha, Kirindiwela and Ambalangoda are some of the outstation participants.
The tournament will be conducted on a league basis during the preliminary round with six groups. Each group will have six teams each. The winners and runners-up of each group will qualify for the Super 12 Round. The 12 teams will be divided into four groups with each group having three teams where they will play each other. The four winners of the Super 12 Round will go for the semis.
Matches until the Super 12 Round will be played 30-overs per innings and the semis and final will be 45-overs affair. All officiating umpires will be from the Association of Professional Umpires, Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Association of Cricket Umpires while the scorers are from Association of Scorers, Sri Lanka.
Last year CCC School of Cricket 'Maroons' beat M.C.A. Cricket Academy 'Blue' in the final. Fingara CA won the loser's final to bag the CCC Runner-up Challenge Trophy beating Sanath Jayasuriya CA.
This year also there will be many special awards including Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best Fielder, Best Wicket Keeper, Player of the Tournament, Best Disciplined Team, Best Performing Foreign team and Best Outstation Team. Man of the Match awards will be presented in semis and final.
The final will be played at the CCC grounds on December 22 followed by the awards ceremony in the evening at the Bishop's College Auditorium, commencing from 7 pm with the participation of Sri Lankan World Cup champion team member Roshan Mahanama.

Graeme Smith hints at international comeback
DUBAI, Tuesday: Disappointed by South Africas meek surrender in the just-concluded Test series against India, retired former captain Graeme Smith said after seeing his ex-teammates struggle so much, he might consider returning to international cricket.
South Africa lost the four-match rubber 0-3, two of those defeats coming inside three days.
Smith, who will be seen in the Masters Champions League (MCL) for the Virgo Super Kings franchise, said seeing the decimation, coming out of retirement has become a serious thought on his mind.
Who knows the MCL could be a platform back into the international game, Smith told The National newspaper.
I get asked this question a lot. It does spend time in your head, especially when you see the boys struggling in India you think you can contribute, but well see. Ill go back train, prepare and get ready for the MCL, the 34-year-old, who retired last year, said.

Gulf Cup triumph spurs Shalini's dreams of being UAE's cricket star
Women's cricket in the Gulf may be undergoing labour pains but a couple of talented Sri Lankans are already making their mark for champions UAE.
Kyna Vedhasinghe, 19, is a UAE 'veteran' representing the national team for the sixth consecutive time at the Gulf Women's T20 Cricket Championship held in Qatar while Shalini Wanniarachchi, 25, has made her international debut.
Another Sri Lankan youngster Kavisha Kumari was a member of the UAE team that successfully defended the title won in Oman last year.
A product of Desert Cubs Cricket Academy headed by a former Sri Lanka first-class cricketer Presley Polonnowita, UAE-born Kyna made a memorable half century in a league match against Oman.
Her sparkling career-best knock of 62 off 48 balls studded with eight boundaries earned her the player of the match award.
In the final against Qatar when UAE lost five wickets chasing a small target of 47, Kyna kept her composure to hit the winning boundary for UAE.
"We bowled really well but we lost a lot of wickets in the final. We managed to lose five wickets," said Kyna who has ambitions of pursuing her cricket career either in Sri Lanka or Australia once she completes her higher education at at Emirates Aviation Academy.
A keen student of the game from the age of 11, Kyna has toured Australia, England Sri Lanka and Oman with Desert Cubs where she has enjoyed her cricket with different conditions. She has also toured Kuwait twice, Thailand, Doha, and Oman with the UAE team.
A batting all-rounder, Kyna also earned the player of the finals for the Dubai Cricket Council organised tournament before the Doha tour.
"It was a really good experience. We showed other teams how much more professional the cricket is here (UAE) now and how much we developed since the beginning. Qatar and Oman were saying they have a lot more to learn from the way we play cricket because we have so much aggression on the field. We have remained unbeaten since last Gulf Cup in nine matches," said Kyna who made her international debut for the UAE at the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) tournament in Kuwait in 2012.
Kyna hails from a sporting family. Her mother Christine was a netballer and athlete at school level in Sri Lanka while her father Aaron played cricket, rugby and badminton. Retired Sri Lanka great Mahela Jayawardene is her role model.
For Shalini it was a dream come true when she received the call to play for UAE in the Gulf tournament.
A right arm fast bowler, she was elated after picking up a wicket on debut against Qatar and bowled an impressive spell in the final conceding just three runs in three overs.
"I liked cricket from childhood. I really wanted to play but I did not get chance in Sri Lanka because we did not have cricket at that time," said Shalini who studied at Visakha Balika, Sapugaskanda, where she played everything from netball volleyball, football and athletics (high jump).
"I had a habit of collecting pictures of cricket players from childhood," said Shalini who idolises Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara, South Africans AB de Villiers and the fiery Dale Steyn.
Her cricketing journey took off when she came to the UAE two years ago after joining Desert Cubs, even touring South Africa with their boys' team in March 2014 where she won two medals for best performances.
She missed the inaugural Gulf Cup because she had to qualify by residency.
"This year I got the opportunity. I want to be become a cricket star in UAE now," declared Shalini while expressing her gratitude to Desert Cubs coach Indika Batuwitarachchi, UAE women's coach Mohammed Hyder Kazmi and her bosses Sadiq and Shamsudeen.
A gym instructor by profession, the Gulf tournament has raised her confidence so much that she plans to qualify as an ICC Level 1 coach. "It was good experience for me actually. It gave me confidence and encouragement to continue my cricket career. I want to improve with more practice. I always want to become a fast bowler. My family always supported me," said Shalini whose other talent is singing is the elder sibling of Tharuka Wanniarachchi, a rising actress on the small screen.

## Title: Hunger Games & Harry Potter: The Art of Splitting The Final Book Into Two Films
## Supertitle:

Hunger Games & Harry Potter: The Art of Splitting The Final Book Into Two Films
Splitting the final book into two movies may be a financial decision, but it often results in the best films of a franchise.
This article contains spoilers for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay: Parts 1 and 2 and Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows: Parts 1 and 2.
These days, it seems like every film adaptation of a popular book series - especially those geared toward young adults - is choosing to split its final book into two separate films. The trend began with Warner Bros.' decision to split the final book in the Harry Potter series - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - into two films, starting in 2010. It has most recently been tested again with the splitting of the final book in The Hunger Games series - Mockingjay - into two films.
The practical reasoning for this decision More movies, more money. Fair enough. After all, this reasoning tends to be true. However, inevitably, when the decision to split the final book in a series into two films is announced, it is met with disgust. Fans - or at least the media - accuse the studios of prioritizing the financial over the creative.
This may be true, but it doesn't have to be the whole truth. From where I'm standing, the decisions to split Mockingjay and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows into two parts resulted in the best films in both franchises: Mockingjay: Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.
Of course, it's important to note that these book-to-film examples also have some pretty meaty source material to begin with. Splitting a terrible book into two movies will not make two good films. (Sorry, Divergent.) But when you're starting with a rich, complex fictional world, book-splitting can lead to the very best of films. Here's why...
The first halves of Mockingjay and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (the books) are arguably the least plot-heavy of either respective book series. Katniss spends much of her time (understandably) cowering in District 13 closets, trying to deal with her PTSD. Harry, Ron, and Hermione traipse aimlessly around the British countryside, hoping to stumble upon a Horcrux.
Given these relatively plot-light story arcs, I worried that the film adaptations wouldn't have enough material to adapt into a feature length film without dragging. This was silly. Not having enough plot to cover the two-hour run times ended up being their greatest asset. After all, in many ways, plot is the simplest of story structures. It may be the most necessary, but it is also often the least interesting.
As a structure, the Hollywood blockbuster tends to favor plot above all else. It's somewhat understandable in the context of a Hollywood blockbuster's primary aim: to make as much money as possible, presumably by entertaining as many people as possible. To oversimplify a much more complicated formula, this usually happens with a combination of effective plot and bombastic visuals. In the Hollywood blockbuster, there tends to be less time for theme, character development, or indulging in the tone or ambience of a setting.
This commitment to plot above all else is a problem when adapting the most complex, involved, and interesting of a book series. These books tell intricately-crafted stories that take more than just a good understanding of plot to translate onto the screen. Because of their unique positions in their larger film franchises, Mockingjay: - Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 were given the most freedom to explore these other storytelling elements. Let's look at some specific examples...
The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 has many glorious scenes: The suspenseful, Polyjuice-aided escape from the Dursleys to the Burrow. The montage of Harry, Ron, and Hermione listening to the radio as they walk across Britain. The gorgeously-rendered animation of "The Deathly Hallows" story. But it is a quiet, emotionally-raw scene that was not in the books that is perhaps the best scene in the entire film and franchise. I'm referring, of course, to the dance scene between Harry and Hermione...
If The Deathy Hallows hadn't been split into two films, there is no way this would have made it into the movie. It is an indulgent, character-driven moment that has no larger bearing on the plot. It could be cut from the film without the audience ever knowing it was missing. And that would be a shame. Because it is a beautiful affirmation of Harry and Hermione's friendship.
Their dance doesn't solve any of their problems, it only briefly makes them feel better, but it is a reminder - to both the viewer and the characters - that they are just kids. They should be dancing, not shouldering this impossible burden. It is tragic and hopeful and joyful all at once.
This scene is indicative of a larger interest The Deathly Hallows has in theme and character. The dance scene may be the best cohesive representation of those slightly-skewed interests, but this entire film takes it time, exploring mood and motivation in a way the other films are rarely given the chance to do.
It's hard to discuss the creative advantages of splitting books into multiple movies without segueing into a discussion of the limits of the film form for such adaptations. For me, television is the natural choice for translating book series onto the screen. Even if Game of Thrones isn't my favorite, I revel in the opportunities it has to expand on, change, and improve upon its source material. (Because, for all of the strengths literary storytelling has over screen storytelling, so, too, does screen storytelling have its strengths over literary storytelling.)
Currently, these book-to-film franchises are set somewhere in between film and television in regards to narrative form. Yes, they are undoubtedly filmic at their cores, but they have some of the sensibilities of serialized television. This is especially evident when it comes to these penultimate films, tasked only with telling the first half of a novel and, therefore, given the space to engage in setting, theme, and character much more thoroughly.
For all of the ways that the first parts in Mockingjay - Part 1 and The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 take their time to indulge, explore, and engage in their fictional worlds, the second parts resume their prioritization of churning through book plot and are the lesser for it. Denofgeek.us

SLC begins process to clear him
Kusal Perera took drug treatment for a leech bite
Sri Lankas exciting young batsman Kusal Perera tested positive for a banned substance by the ICC took medical treatment after being bitten by a leech on his foot during the home series against Pakistan last June, SLC sources have stated.
Perera was administered the drug to cure him from the bite by one of the Sri Lankan team physios, but where the physio and Perera erred was that they failed to inform the ICC about the use of the drug as should be the case.
Sri Lanka Cricket interim committee has seven days ie time till December 14 to send a formal notification to the ICC in writing that they wish to have the B sample also analysed.
The SLC IC it is learnt has agreed in principle to undertake the total cost for testing and requested the ICC to arrange a neutral venue for the testing to take place.
In the event of the B sample also proving to be positive, SLC IC has decided to pursue legal action to clear Perera.
Pursuant to Article 7.1.3.3 of the Code states:
8. You have the right to defend this charge (at your own cost), and to have a hearing before the Tribunal in accordance with Article 8 of the Code. If you wish to have such a hearing (which may be carried out by video-conference, if convenient to all parties), you MUST file a written request for such a hearing with the ICC as soon as possible, but in any event within fourteen days of your receipt of this letter, i.e. by no later than 5 pm (UAE time) on 21 December 2015.
Such written request should also include your initial response to the charge contained herein (namely whether you admit or deny the charge), together with an explanation (in summary form) of the basis of such response. You would then have an opportunity to provide a full response at a later date.

Lanka should publish budget revenue, expenditure consequences
Sri Lanka should move towards a more professional way of managing the economy and take immediate measures to publish revenue and expenditure consequences of numerous budgetary promises made by the government.
Verit Research Executive Director and Head of Research Nishan de Mel speaking at the LBO-LBR Business Forum under the theme 'Business Climate Outlook of 2016' said the various budgetary promises, changes in expenditure and policies should always come to Parliament with the estimate of the revenue or expenditure consequences as budget promises are easily forgotten once the budget is over.
"There are some debts that are not even calculated in budget accounting. Public service pensions is a huge debt that the government accrues year by year.The country should take immediate measures to make it mandatory to at least publish the present discounted value estimates of pension debts.
"We have a pension scheme in which there is no obligation to do the national accounting of the debt that is accrued to the future when pension promises are made today."
Commenting on the government's measures to cut budget deficit targets, he pointed out that the cutting of the deficits didn't happen in the way that necessarily was helpful to the long-term development of the country and sectors that need investments.
"There is a serious problem in using what's said in budget year on year as means of setting expectations of the future. Not understanding how revenue is actually going to go forward, government tries to create short-term revenue crunches that have to be met with short-term solutions.
The country is not yet in the right political cycle where the solving of the major issues has been made politically important."
He also added that Sri Lanka is faced with serious issues with regard to unlocking and attracting the labour force in a viable way into higher productivity and higher wages.
According to De Mel, Sri Lankan labour is opting out of work because either they are stuck in the unproductive agricultural sector or they are opting out to go for low skilled jobs or semi skilled jobs outside the country. Export and foreign direct investments depend on the ability of the country to help a large number of small players to create jobs and support production processes.
He pointed out that anticipating changes will not come by back door lobbying ; changes will only come when there is a social and wider business level consciousness that government must deliver out of the structural changes.

I really look forward to develop their skills to face international players," said the Sri Lanka cricket legend who is one of four players to have taken two hat-tricks in ODIs, including a hat-trick with the first three balls against Bangladesh during the 2003 World Cup.
"Our academy will mainly focus on cricketers of age 5 to 19 but also will be accommodating special programme for corporates, senior cricketers and other segments," declared Vaas who also played in the English county circuit for Middlesex, Northamptonshire and Worcestershire.
