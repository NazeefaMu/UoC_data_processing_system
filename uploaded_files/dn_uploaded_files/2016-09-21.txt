Ladies Day at RTC ends on a high
It was Ladies Day out at the racecourse in Nuwara Eliya, the home of the Royal Turf Club and the cradle of the revival of horse racing in Sri Lanka. It was almost as if the scenic beauty of one of the most picturesque racetracks in the world was being complimented by the bevy of beauties that descended on to the lush green turf that abounds in the manicured precincts of the RTC.
It has been a tough couple of months for the equine residents of the Stables at RTC. Inclement weather, unseasonal rain and torrents that would virtually make the ground and underfoot conditions unfit to train on, adversely affected the fitness levels of most of the racehorses and that has contributed in a huge way to the number that were actually able to race. However the show has to go on and with that in mind the RTC managed to put together a Five Race Card.
The first race of the day the Lady McCallum Cup for three quarter Sri Lankan bred saw the bottom weighted Carbrese waltz away to an effortless victory. Owned by the effervescent and stylish Deepthika Jayakody, Carbrese was trained by S P A Raju and ridden with aplomb by K. Sanjeevan .
The RTC Ladies Day Cup turned out to be a one horse race as the bay 7-year-old gelding Icelandic virtually put the opposition on ice as he won by a widening margin at the finish. Owned by Hasanga Jayaratne, Icelandic was trained by S V Madialagan and ridden by S. Suganathan who rode a well judged race.
The Plantation Industries Cup which was the feature event of the day looked like it was going to be a close affair when all four runners were within a length of each other at the 600 metre marker. But that was when the front runner Chul Bul Pandey and jockey Christopher decided to take things into their own hands. They quickened and the opposition was left struggling behind a superb burst of acceleration. The winner is owned by Anura Delgoda and trained by S V Madialagan. The Minister of Plantation Industries Navin Dissanayake did the honours and presented the trophy to the winner.
Laura Davis the British Deputy High Commissioner graced the occasion and she presented the Queens Autumn Cup to Aruna Delgoda whose 5-year-old chestnut horse Torpedo, blew up the opposition to give his owner a cup double. Trainer S V Madialagan had a superb day as Torpedo gave him a hat trick of wins.
Arundhati's hard fought victory in the Ceylon Ladies Cup brought the curtain down on an entertaining and exciting day. It was only fitting that a mare named Arundhati brought the curtain down on Ladies Day at the Royal Turf Club Nuwara Eliya.
It has always been said that you can't compete with the fairer sex when it comes to hogging the limelight and on Saturday it was the Ladies who ruled the roost. Racing is what brings it all together but this time the four legged equines took the proverbial back seat as the Ladies who flocked to the RTC arena made it look like scenes from Royal Ascot or the Melbourne Cup.
Adding to the charm and the ambience was Natasha Rathnayake rocking the crowd as she belted out one popular number after another and her group of dancers wowed the crowds with some real nifty footwork.
If the fashion on display was not eye catching enough, Catherine of latelier Touch fame, set the ramp alight with a truly exhilarating fashion show. The theme was tropical wear and you can bet your last rupee on the fact that a lot of the young ladies who come racing again in October 29 will be sporting the outfits that were displayed today.

Beams bowls Australia Women to 78-run win
Riding on Kristen Beams four-wicket haul and half-centuries from Nicole Bolton and Alex Blackwell, Australia Women thrashed Sri Lanka Women by 78 runs in Dambulla to take a 2-0 lead in the four-match ODI series.
Sri Lankas chase of 255 got off to a terrible start as they were reduced to 35 for 5 in the 18th over, with Beams taking three of the first five wickets. The hosts ultimately managed to cobble together 176 for 9, helped considerably by the 41 runs in wides offered up by Australias bowlers. That still left Sri Lanka with a big defeat, as only Chamari Polgampola playing an innings of substance.
After Australia opted to bat, the top three laid a very solid platform, courtesy scores of 64, 45 and 29 from Nicole Bolton, Elyse Villani and Meg Lanning. Bolton put on 81 off 17.5 overs with Villani for the opening stand, before adding 67 off 11.4 overs with Lanning for the second wicket.
Australia had moved to 148 for 1 before Boltons dismissal, in the 30th over, opened a passage of play in which they lost 5 for 38 in 12.1 overs. Chamari Atapattu took three of those wickets and ended with figures of 3 for 31 in her 10 overs. Blackwells unbeaten 56 off 64 helped them to recover to post 254, with Erin Osborne and Megan Schutt chipping in to keep Blackwell company.
Holly Ferling and Beams then wreaked havoc on Sri Lankas top order, sharing the first five wickets between them to leave the home team tottering by the 18th over. Eshani Lokusuriyage resisted for a while with 20 off 28, before she became Beams fourth wicket. Beams finished with figures of 4 for 15 off 10 overs having broken the back of Sri Lankas batting with her legspin.
Sri Lanka slumped further to 100 for 8 in 35 overs, before showing some fight to bat out their 50 overs. Polgampola, who had come in at No. 3, finished unbeaten on 68 off 136, but the second highest contributor to Sri Lankas total was Extras which accounted for exactly 50 runs. Of those, 41 came from wides alone. Remarkably, Australias bowlers delivered a total of 26 wide balls; each bowler bowled at least one, with Ferling bowling as many as 10.
However, even that blemish could not prevent Australia from romping to a big win and collecting two points in the Womens Championship. Cricinfo
