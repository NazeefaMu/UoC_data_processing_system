Moment of truth for Sri Lanka - take on England today
DELHI: Defending World T20 champs face their moment of truth as they take on England in a Group 1 match at the Feroz Shah Kotla ground here on Saturday which is crucial for their survival for the rest of the tournament.
Sri Lanka has one win and one loss from two games and they will need to win against England as well as South Africa on Monday at the same venue to qualify for the knockout stage. Failure to beat England could mean an exit from the tournament regardless of the final group game against South Africa.
Sri Lanka had six days off to recuperate and tighten up their game for their remaining two encounters.
"We had a good break. Two of those days were total rest - without training.
It was for them to concentrate on their own games to watch videos of them batting as well as bowling, and to analyse where they went wrong," said Dinesh Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
"In those days we also made a lot of plans about how to challenge England.

There will be a few small changes. Those changes will also be made to surprise them. We have a game plan and we have something up our sleeves.
The thing is we have to execute it in the middle. We are hopeful we can give them a good game."
Sri Lanka's prime concern has been their middle order batting which has let them down on several occasions. The void left by the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara is certainly proving to be causing a big headache for Sri Lanka in their batting line up.
Those sentiments were expressed clearly by Chandimal when he said, "We are concerned about our middle order we are struggling. It can happen when you come to big games like this. We don't have experienced guys in the middle.
The guys are really working hard at practices if our middle order clicks together, we'll have a good chance.
"We can't always keep on saying every time that it's our transition period.
We've got some experienced guys as well as youngsters. We have to put our hands up and put our performance for the side. We will give it our best shot in the next two games."
The way the Delhi pitch behaved three days ago where the Afghanistan spinners had the England batsmen in all sorts of trouble, has given Sri Lanka some hope ahead of today's contest.
"England played their first two games at the Wankhede (Mumbai) and we all know that's one of the best pitches India has got. Here it's totally different. The wickets are slow. I think that'll really help us. But we'll have to play well," said Chandimal.
They key to Sri Lanka in the bowling is experienced spinner Rangana Herath but for him to win the match for his team the batting unit will need to put enough runs on the board, which they have not done so far in the
tournament, and has been their Achilles heel.
"We all know Rangana is a world class bowler. He can cause damage in the next two games against England and South Africa who usually struggle against spin," said Chandimal.
"We've also got (Jeffrey) Vandersay who is a surprise package, and Sachithra (Senanayake). If they do their best we have a good chance. We all expect a lot from Rangana, he knows how to handle those pressure situations. I think he will have a huge role to play in the next two games."
Assessing the England team, Chandimal said, "Compared to the past five or six years when they weren't concerned about the T20 format, now they are thinking. They've got some good players like (Joe) Root and (Jos) Buttler - they are the key. They are playing really well. We never underestimate any team. We'll have to play our brand of cricket."
Chandimal said that he would prefer chasing a total in the T20 format rather than setting up one." In T20 formats it's always better to chase.
When you're batting first you don't have a target in your mind, but you do when you're chasing. You can assess the first six overs how you need to bat. Chasing is an advantage as far as I'm concerned."

Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has been a great source of encouragement - Sanath
Celebrated Sri Lanka cricketer Sanath Jayasuriya said that the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has been a great source of encouragement to budding schoolboy cricketers, aspiring to step into the big league.
The only schools cricket awards show until the last couple of decades, the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show is now considered the 'Mother of all school cricket award shows'. What is unique in the show is that it had developed a new culture by recognizing the raw talent, at a time when there had not been any organized tournament for first X1 cricket.
The master blaster who graced the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show in 2013 as the chief guest, got an opportunity to go down memory lane and recall those great milestones of his cricketing career as a schoolboy at St. Servatious College, Matara. Jayasuriya who later went on to captain Sri Lanka with distinction, says that the inspiration and encouragement he got after receiving the top award was immense. "It was a great feeling, getting rewarded on conclusion of a strenuous inter-school cricket season. Unlike today, there were hardly any such shows to reward the outstanding schoolboy cricketers," Jayasuriya said.
Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year (Outstation) title as a promising schoolboy from Matara, way back in 1988, was the turning point in Jayasuriya's distinguish career as a cricketer. It was the then Principal of his school , G. L. Galappathy and coach Lionel Munasinghe who had been instrumental in nourishing his school career as a youngster.
Jayasuriya's outstanding contribution for St. Servetus with the willow earned that top award - a dream of any schoolboy cricketer for nearly four decades!
In the very next year, Jayasuriya made his ODI debut for Sri Lanka against Australia in Melbourne - on December 26, 1989. Since then, he became a vital ingredient in Sri Lanka team's successful recipe. By the time he retired from ODIs on June 28, 2011, he had aggregated 13,480 runs in 445 matches, cracking 28 centuries and 68 fifties. He had also captured 323 wickets in ODIs.
Jayasuriya's contribution was not only confined to ODIs. Though he was branded a limited over cricketer during the early part of his career, his has proved his credentials in the established game beyond reasonable doubts. Jayasiriya's career best 340 against India became the highest individual innings by Lanka batsman in Tests.
He has a rich aggregate if 6,973 runs in 110 Tests inclusive of 14 centuries and 31 fifties at an attractive average of 40.07. His all-round qualities as a Test player include 98 wickets and 78 catches.
The dashing opening batsman is one of the six Sri Lanka cricket captains produced through the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year series with others being celebrated cricketers such as Ranjan Madugalle, Arjuna Ranatunga, Roshan Mahanama (ODIs), Marvan Atapattu and Dinesh Chandimal (T20s).
Making his presence at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year podium, some 26 years after winning that dream award, Jayasuriya advised the young schoolboy cricketers to be focused on the game so that success would come their way if they play their heart outs. Jayasuriya who had later headed the national selection committee feels that a good cricketer must devote a lot of time and the success would follow thereafter.
Jayasuriya said that when he started playing cricket, he never thought that he would go this far and achieve such success for Sri Lanka cricket.
Besides the loads of trophies that had been added to his rich collection after the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year trophy, Jayasuriya was adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the Series when Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996 under another proud recipient of Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title, Arjuna Ranatunga.
Jayasuriya said that Lake House has done a yeoman service to the young cricketers and promotion of the game in conducting the mega awards show since 1979. "It is a fine gesture on the part of the Lake House and the Sunday Observer to host the show uninterrupted so that the young boys across the country will have something to look for when they end their school career," he observed. He is of the view that sponsorships are vital for game to proceed as conducting a mega show of this magnitude is a costly exercise. Ever since Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel's association with the event as the principal sponsor, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has gone from strength to strength. This will be the ninth successive year that the SLT Mobitel is providing the financial backing to the mega event. Thanks to the untiring efforts of SLT Mobitel's Chief Operative Officer Nalin Perera, father of Sri Lanka youth cricketer Angelo Perera, the mega show has continued to remain the dream of every schoolboy cricketer!
