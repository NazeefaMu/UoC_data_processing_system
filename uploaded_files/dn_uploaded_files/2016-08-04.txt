It should be  Padhada  Yathra: Harin

The Pada Yathra which was conducted by the Joint Opposition under the theme 'Jana Satana Pada Yathra' did not mention the issues faced by the public during the past 18 months, nor did they level a single allegation against the present government. They used it only to criticize President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando said.
In 1992, a Pada Yathra was held against the government, as the people were disappointed with the 15 years of their rule. But this time, the Pada Yathra was held just one and half years after the Good Governance regime came to power and there was no justified reason for it. So this cannot be proclaimed as a Pada Yathra, it was a 'Padhada Yathra', he explained.
No Pada Yathra of this sort was allowed during the previous regime. But we, the present government let it finish in a very peaceful manner. During the previous regime, they did not allow us to march a kilometer against them and they used gangsters, tear gas and water cannons to stop us. But we did not do so, as this Pada Yathra was not a challenge to the present government.
The former president and Kurunegala District MP is now claiming that the present IGP is a thug. We could not control our laughs as we know the way his henchmen treated the senior police officers during his rule. Meanwhile, Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage is saying that more than two million people participated in the Pada Yatra on the final day, August 01 at Lipton Circus. As I know, he failed math though he was a Royalist.
I know that we are not perfect and we too have our faults. But at present we are making an effort to rebuild our motherland which had been ruined by the previous regime. When we are making such an effort, the joint opposition is holding Pada Yathra and criticizing the President and Prime Minister using foul language. In spite of that, they have used a child to criticize the President, which is a cheap and shameful act," Fernando further said.
Addressing a press briefing held at the United National Party (UNP) Headquarters, Sirikotha, Fernando said that Rajapaksa, his eldest son Namal Rajapaksa and their henchmen have gone crazy over their defeat and greed for power. Hence they have no idea about what they do.
Namal believes that walking in a Pada Yathra is a qualification to become the future president of Sri Lanka, as his father had done it in 1992. However throughout this procession the public saw how the participants behaved.
If they organized it to address the issues faced by the public under the Good Governance regime, how can they dance along the roads, criticize others or travel in vehicles eating ice cream, he questioned.
The public issues cannot be solved by walking along the roads with gangsters, murderers, louts and tramps. It is like walking in front of the public naked.
The person who made a teacher kneel in school and the one who killed a British National and raped his girl friend during the previous rule, have also taken part in the Joint Opposition's Pada Yathra.
That is why I call it the 'Padhada Yathra,' he further stated.

JO cannot challenge government - Ruwan

The Joint Opposition cannot pose any challenge to the government which comprises the countrys two main political parties while holding Paada Yathra, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.
Misdeeds by the previous regime cannot be pardoned. We remember the way they acted in Rathupaswela and Katunayake incidents and the way they behaved when we protested. They arrested General Sarath Fonseka in 2010. How can they solve public issues through a Paada Yathra which they used for entertainment and making criticism against the government, the State Minister questioned. They set up a shadow cabinet. We saw the way its foreign minister acted in the Paada Yathra which was said to address the common issues of the public.
The only thing they have pointed out throughout their march is the necessity of a family rule.
A group comprising bankrupt politicians is trying to break up the Sri Lanka Freedom Party into two groups. They are using Mahinda Rajapaksa as a tool to fulfill their needs, he said.
A government is usually opposed by holding protests during the final phase of its ruling period. But the Joint Opposition has began to show their opposition towards the Yaha Palana government just after a year. We can correct our mistakes and go forward if they point out our failures in a correct manner, Wijewardene said.

SLFP to contest  LG poll under  Hand symbol

Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijitha Wijayamuni Soysa said the SLFP will contest the Local Government elections under the Hand symbol, as it (Hand symbol) had been forgotten by many.
The Hand symbol, the colour blue and the Bandaranaikes were the well known slogans we used when we established the party. The party has its own respect and a strong place in the hearts of the people which can never be destroyed. This decision has been taken to maintain the standards of the party,he said.
The observation was made yesterday at a press conference held at Irrigation Department.
Minister Soysa added that people will very soon understand the motives of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He condemned the behavior of the Joint Opposition referring to Pada Yatra protesters who hooted at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headquarters.
Even in a family there are children who do not respect their parents or the family. The behavior of those SLFPers who were disrespectful towards the party leader and the party headquarters is also something similar,he said.
The party was humiliated in the presence of many senior SLFP ministers yet no one did take notice of it. A majority of those in the Joint Opposition group are not people who can be identified as being from the SLFP, as they are people who destroyed their own parties, he added.
He went on to note that SLFPers and the people of the country must understand the democracy that has been brought to the party under the leadership of Maithripala Sirisena and that must be protected.
Minister further said though the JO members were holding protest marches all around the country shouting slogans against the government, it was necessary to understand that they can never topple the government.
Many members who speak against President Sirisena and the party, phone the President during the other day and tell him that the media had misquoted them,he added.
He also assured that strict disciplinary action would be taken against party members for their bad behavior at the rally.
Asked whether he still wishes to work with Joint Opposition Members, Minister Soysa said that those people are still attached to the SLFP.
Referring to the usage of a small boy to speak against the government, Minister said it was a shameful act of the JO members.
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) should take necessary action, he added.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about MPs Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammapila, Minister Soysa said that he can never work with MP Weerawansa and added that Gammanpila is still a child in the field of politics.

Australia in danger  of losing no.1 ranking

GALLE: Australia are in danger of losing their number one Test ranking if they suffer another defeat to Sri Lanka at Galle, venue of the second Test starting today.
Defeat would mean they concede the three-match series 0-2.
Prior to the start of the series the scenario was that Australia will have to win 2-0 or better against seventh-ranked Sri Lanka to ensure it does not go below its current 118 points. In contrast if Sri Lanka wins even by 1-0 they will earn seven points and move to 92 while Steve Smiths side will slip to 111 points which means they drop below second placed India who are bound to improve their points as they are playing eighth-ranked West Indies.
Over the past three days or so the Aussies have been working their butts out trying to come to terms with the amount of spin subcontinent pitches offer.
Generally in Australia spin bowlers just get the ball to not react too differently off the surface, you can hit through the line of the ball and there is a small margin for error whereas here you have a bigger margin for error especially in the subcontinent, said Smith.
Its just the ball that reacts differently off the surface. It is very foreign and the guys have been working hard to try and get used to these conditions as much as possible. Having said that out in the middle with the extra pressures, guys around the bat and guys bowling well it could be difficult at times. You have to get better to handle them out in the middle.
Weve been doing a lot of work in the nets, spinners bowling getting the right speed, getting used to the breeze, theres quite a lot of drift for the spin bowlers. The batters are trying to be very successful in these conditions we havent been able to do that so far. Its been a while in subcontinent conditions that we have been able to be successful as a batting group. We are trying to turn that around, he said.
Of the 15 batsmen who were ruled out lbw in the Pallekele Test, six were Australians.
Looking at our dismissals in the last Test match the majority of us got beaten on the inside of the bat and coming straight on. So we are trying to get our pad out of the way and play with our bats. We have been working on that on different guards. Its about implementing that in the game, said Smith.
We were a bit disappointed and flat initially now the moods brightened up a bit its about trying to turn it around. Australian sides come back from 0-1 down in the subcontinent. Its all about rewriting history it would be great to do that on this tour.
Australia will make only one change to their 11 that played at Pallekele with uncapped left-arm spinner Jon Holland replacing injured Steve OKeefe.  ST
AUSTRALIAN SQUAD: Joe Burns, David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith (captain), Adam Voges, Mitch Marsh, Peter Nevill (wk), Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Jon Holland, Josh Hazlewood.

## Title: Kandy   Australias  hoodoo venue

Kandy   Australias  hoodoo venue

The Sri Lanka cricket team cleverly handled by captain Angelo Mathews created history last Saturday at the picturesque Pallekelle International Stadium by recording their second Test win after 17 years against the Australians, who are rated as the No. 1 Test team in the world.
Australia last lost to Sri Lanka also in Kandy by six wickets at Asgiriya Stadium in September 11, 1999.
Undoubtedly one of the happiest people was former master blaster and now chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya. The smile he sported at the conclusion of the Test said it all. In 1999 he was the captain when Sri Lanka first beat Australia. This win came under his selection committee chairmanship.
At Pallekele Australians chasing 268 for victory were all out for 161, their innings finishing with a record 154 consecutive deliveries without a run. Australia had a first-innings lead of 86. But Kusal Mendis first Test century 176 runs and Rangana Heraths 5-54 put paid to their chances of winning.
Australia captain Steve Smith made a gritty 55 before tail-enders Steve OKeefe and Peter Nevill resisted for 178 balls, scoring only four runs. OKeefe and Nevills ninth-wicket stand came at just 0.13 runs an over, before debutant Dhananjaya de Silva had Nevill caught behind. The previous record for a partnership lasting 100 balls or more was 0.64 by South Africas Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers against India last December.
It was a remarkable win for Sri Lanka after having being shot out for 117 in the first innings and then reeling at six for two in the second innings before Mendis made his superb knock which earned him the man-of-the-match award which was presented by chief minister of Central Province Sarath Ekanayake. All players should be commended for turning this game and winning it which at one time looked unlikely. Herath bowled his side to victory by taking nine wickets in the match.
This triumph for Sri Lanka came in 27 matches across the 33-year-history between the teams. Sri Lanka has won two and lost ten games.
The biggest draw back at the venue was the absence of local fans even when the Lankans were winning. There were so few locals with Australian tourists out numbering them. Sri Lanka went into this Test match with an inexperienced side including two debutants.
Along with Herath, Lakshan Sandakan, bowled well with match figures of 7-107 on debut.
It is obvious that right hander Mendis and chinaman bowler Sandakan are the future of Sri Lanka cricket. Mendis should not be tagged great just yet and not compared with former Sri Lanka great batsmen. He has greatness written all over him as his knocks in cold England and now in the First Test showed. He has the right technique and temperament coupled with the right strokes to make waves in the all-important Test cricket. If properly handled he should turn out to being another master class like former captain Mahela Jayewardene.
In Sandakan Sri Lanka has unearthed an uncut gem. Never before has Sri Lanka cricket produced a chinaman bowler in the class of Sandkan. We have had great lefties like Daya Sahabandu and Ajit de Silva, but never the likes of Lakshan Sandakan. He had the Aussie batsmen like cats on a hot tin roof jumping around unable to read his mystery deliveries as to which way it was going.
He reminded one of a bowler of similar style the Aussies had not so long ago in David Sincock. If handled properly he could turn put into being a match winner for Sri Lanka in the future.
