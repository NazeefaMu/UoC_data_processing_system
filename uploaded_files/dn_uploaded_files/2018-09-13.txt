Corruption allegations against government, hypocritical
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas allegations of corruption against the government was hypocritical, given that the underworld faced no resistance during his regime, State Fisheries, Aquatic Resources Development and Rural Economic Affairs Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi said. He was addressing a meeting of fisherfolk, recently.
The minister said the Good Governance Government had ensured democracy.
The public, as well as the media, had the freedom to speak their minds as no one would abduct them, he added.

Nestl Needs YOUth initiative  makes 6,000 youth employable
More than 6,000 young Sri Lankans have received support to build skills and enhance their employability through the Nestl Needs YOUth initiative. Nestl, which has a long tradition of recruiting young people directly from universities, launched the programme in 2016 to help address the issue of youth unemployment.
Since the initiatives launch, Nestl has strengthened its focus on offering young people employment opportunities. Currently close to 35% of Nestls workforce is under 30 and more than 60% are millennials. It is also facilitating dual education (i.e. combining on-the-job training with university-based learning), which is a key success factor in bridging the gap between school and the workplace.
Speaking on International Youth Day, Shivani Hegde, Nestl Managing Director said: Nestl is committed to investing in the next generation of talented young people, to help them build skills and be better prepared to enter the professional world, so they improve their chances in a challenging job market.
It will be hard to thrive as a corporation, and help the communities we are part of to grow, unless we can hone the skills of young people who will drive the next wave of development.
As a part of its Nestl Needs YOUth initiative, Nestl has several programmes which have helped 6,000 youth become more employable over the last two years. It is facilitating dual education via internships, and a professional marketing programme taught by Nestl Managers to students from the University of Kelaniya.
Nestls Trainee Engineering Programme in its factory in Kurunegala also provides engineering graduates an all-round comprehensive training and work familiarisation, to give them solid work experience that will serve them well in their engineering careers. Good performers are offered employment within the company.
Through its NERI (Nestl Education Responsibility Initiative) Programme, Nestl also conducts work readiness sessions for university students on CV writing, facing interviews, career guidance, and tips to succeed at the workplace, through digital media, job fairs and workshops.
Its WIN (Women in Nestl) volunteer group, formed to support female employees, is now providing readiness-for-work workshops for both female and male students from rural universities, as well as differently abled young adults.
The companys focus on developing youth extends to its own employees. Its comprehensive 18 months Management Trainee Programme, which has been successful for years, is a significant initiative in developing young people to be the companys future leaders. Many of the companys senior management, including its Managing Director, joined Nestl as Management Trainees.
Nestls I-Tomorrows Leader Programme also offers young talent within the company accelerated training and development modeled after a mini MBA, with high performers offered assignments overseas to support them in paving long-term careers with Nestl.
Enoca Sirimanne, Vice President - Human Resources at Nestl says, All of our youth employment activities are driven by our own employees on a voluntary basis, who takes the time to share their learnings and experiences and develop the next generation of leaders. Our people shape who we are as a company and Im proud that making a difference and living our purpose starts with them.

We are asking the government to offer us a tax concession for motor vehicles that are used for shipping transport sector as entertaining clients at all ports around the island is an important move parallel to port developments. We have started utilising domestic flight services from Colombo to Trincomalee to support aviation sector. (AK)

Asia wide, 7s on radar and significant others for the next level
The season for 7s is upon us and perfect timing for our resident deckchair experts to surface from their deprived slumber.
The current stats for all national teams...aptly describe a frustrating but true story.....that has hugely impacted our Asian status, where it really matters.
Our U20 returned from the Asian Championship a quiet 3rd.
Big shock to the system and partially a sniff away from insult...given the class and quality of the warriors on tour.
Once again Korea left it till extra time and a sudden death try... to drop our players to their knees in sheer disbelief.
Just in case you are wondering why the harp...its simply because, seniors and juniors...were both undone by Korea, and returned home empty handed, all within a fortnight.
Captain juniors, Naveen Heenakan probably unable to logically fathom the loss and ending up 3rd.
Realistically it was our Cup to give away......and a bitter odd shape pill, to watch Hong Kong beat an inspired Korea 5-0, in a desperate final.
One can well understand our boys wanting to scream and kick themselves, for what might have been.
While managing to write ...I also hope, careful analysis and much closer scrutiny of specifically performance stats that lost us a final slot
The report must consider selections...and carrying 4 scrum halves in the playing 12..
Plus the very obvious fact that we were lacking big forwards to secure decent ruck ball...and unable to win the physical contest.
The Asian Games for captain workrate - Muthuthantri, was almost the same level of disbelief and a huge miss out.
On the day, in the middle an agonizing 2 point loss to mighty Japan...did specially 2 important factors
1. Missing out on being in the final and a shot at gold or silver.
2. The stress of loss sapped all our reserve tank and left us weaker in the bronze playoff against Korea. The 36 points scored ...exposed our level and inability to push past the obvious.
3. Korea beat us twice and definitely our Achilles heel yet again.
4. A bigger gap in our team composition...a distinct lack of big impact forwards, and losing the physical contest on the deck.
For coach Woods and Sri Lanka rugbyalas a monumental miss of a silver and a chance for some new Asian Games history.
As we speak, both Sri men and women will be settling in ...checking on training slots etc..for the HK 1st leg Asian 7s series Friday/Saturday.
Men are no. 4...women no. 6.
Tough for team numbers as both our best and most experienced..Muthu and Ranjan....are injured.
Pressure on new skipper SooriyaB, Weerey, Danush Dyan, Dixon, Kavindu...etc...to absorb pressure etc...
The women under new captain Hemakumari...really need to grab this chance. No. 6 to no. 4 ideal.
Japan, HK, China, Khazak, Thailand..in front.
Expectations on Ayesha, Sambu, Sanju, Anusha and Thanuja to deliver under pressure.
So far its all on fitness and prude.
Lets wish both teams focus and max belief for a solid start.
Fundamentally...Sri Lanka needs to show results and earn new respect in Asia...its about time the rhetoric translates into scintillating performance.
Cheers Sri Rugby Islanders.

Brainy breakfast
Breakfast can make or break your childs day in school. Research suggests a strong relationship between reducing childhood obesity, improving academic performance, as well as shaping your kids eating habits as an adult. Recent research shows that kids who leave home without something in their belly are more inclined and distracted at school. Something as simple as a slice of whole wheat toast can greatly improve your childs learning ability as well as prevent chronic illnesses as an adult.
Power up with protein
Fuelling up on protein is a popular choice among nutritionists to kick-start a childs day. A high-protein meal easily ticks off most of the required nutrients for growth and immunity, without the sugar high.
Go low GI
Your kids brain needs a steady supply of carbohydrates, but most processed foods like white bread have too much sugar, which gives him a rush, followed by a slump, even before he reaches school.
According to the Glycemic Index (GI) Foundation in Australia, a steady supply of glucose is necessary for optimum brain function. Given that GI measures the rise of blood sugar levels after a meal, a low GI diet is much better for appetite control from morning to the next meal.
Avoid junk and sugar
Processed breakfast cereals and fried foods are the backbone of childhood obesity. They are low in fibre, protein and full of artificial sweeteners and fat. These junk carbs are absorbed more quickly in the stomach, leaving your kid hungry.
Be a sneaky chef
With over 25 per cent of the days nutrients consumed in the morning, you should sneak more than just a handful of raisins in your kids bowl to meet their daily requirements. Fruits have lots of fibre, vitamins and minerals that are normally left out of childrens diets.
Make it fun
Rather than turning on the TV set and distracting your child from eating her meal, make breakfast the entertainment in the morning. Create breakfast art with her food or give her incentives to eat more coloured super foods, which are jam-packed full of nutrients. Also, work with her interests by keeping her breakfast themed to what shes learning in school.
Think out of the square
Eating toast, oats and eggs can be boring even for adults. So rather than serving up boring ideas that you know your child will hate, try different recipes to encourage more excitement at the table.

Brexit worker issues could shut offshore platforms
Oil and gas platforms could have to be shut down if a deal on Brexit leads to difficulties accessing skilled workers, according to an industry report.
The warning comes in Oil and Gas UKs latest economic report.
It said delays in accessing labour markets from EU countries have the potential, in some instances, of leading to production being shut in.
The UK government said employers could continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020.
The report said about 5% of workers in the UK oil and gas sector come from other EU countries.
That figure rises to seven percent for the offshore workforce.
The report said it was vital that arrangements are in place between the UK and EU to allow the continued frictionless movement of people.
One example related to emergency response vessels stationed close to platforms, which require skilled engineers to operate.
The report said that if difficulties arose in recruiting replacements then platforms would have to shut down operations and production.
To minimise the impact of Brexit, Oil and Gas UK said it was vital that the UK government secured frictionless access to markets and labour, maintained a strong voice in Europe for the industry, and protected the internal energy market.
The 2018 Economic Report revealed that oil prices in the first half of the year were 30% higher than 2017, averaging more than $70 per barrel.
Along with the continued drive to bring down costs, that was estimated to have created more than 10bn of free cash flow.
But it said investors will continue to favour a conservative outlook because of the continued volatility of the oil price. Chief executive Deirdre Michie said: Industry is emerging from one of the most testing downturns in its history. However, the steps that have been taken by industry, government and the regulator have delivered tangible results.
Despite the improvements seen in recent years, we find ourselves at a crossroads. Record low drilling activity, coupled with the supply chain squeeze, threaten industrys ability to effectively service an increase in activity and maximise economic recovery.
The UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) is a more attractive investment proposition - our challenge now is to take advantage of this.
We have to drive an increase in activity while continuing to find and implement even more efficient ways of working which support the health of supply chain companies whilst also keeping costs under control.
The report said the cost of producing oil had halved since its peak and was now averaging around $15 per barrel.
This has followed an industry-wide drive to bring down costs and extend the life of the UK sector. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: The oil and gas industry is crucial to the UKs economy and energy security. Thats why we are providing a 2.3bn support package of measures.
EU citizens make a huge contribution to the oil and gas industry and weve provided certainty to the industry that employers will be free to continue recruiting from Europe up until 2020. (BBC)

Bride and beautiful
With pre-marriage preparations underway it is easy to overstrain the body, stock up on stimulants like tea or coffee, skip meals and get proper eye shut. All this and emotional pressure takes a toll on the body and mind. Plan the countdown to your big day with these guidelines by our beauty expert.
Difference between bridal make up and everyday make up
Regular Makeup is generally one colour foundation and eye makeup is more of an everyday look whereas bridal makeup is much heavier and takes a longer time to do to achieve the entire look.
Wearing false eye lashes on your wedding day
It most certainly is nice for a bride to wear false eye lashes on her wedding day. Thick eye lashes give that extra oomph and bring out the definition in the eyes.
Most common mistake that brides-to-be do
I personally feel that the biggest mistake that brides can make is the lack of preparation for the big day and facing unexpected events. This will in turn result in both the bride as well as the bridal stylist team conflicting over mundane things. At the end of the day, the big day is about the bride and groom and their commitment to each other. However, if the bride is stressed about the planning prior to the special events, I think she will be stressed over these events rather than enjoying her day.
Getting ready routine on your wedding day
Keep around 3 to 4 hours for dressing time on your big day. The photographers require about another 2 to 3 hours to capture your shots soon after you are ready.
Bridal faux pas to avoid
Never experiment with various haircuts nearing the wedding day. A bride needs to feel relaxed and fresh on her big day so avoid taking on a lot of responsibilities in organizing the wedding by yourself. Leave the work to the professionals and let them perform their magic in transforming you into an elegant bride.
- Compiled by Ruwini Jayawardana
Beauty regime for a bride to be
a) Hair:
The bride should do hair treatments a few weeks leading up to the big day. She may also want to consider trimming and styling her hair in preparation for the final bridal style.
b) Skin:
I personally suggest waxing, facials and cleanups to have a glowing look.
c) Nails:
Go for both pedicure and manicures and style depending on your personal preferences.
d) Personal hygiene:
Personal hygiene is an utmost priority whether you are a bride or not and it should be taken into priority for your big day. Simple care regimes like oral care, and body odour prevention is a necessity.
e) Diet:
Avoid processed food to prevent skin allergies and breakouts. Limit foods that contain a high amount of sugars and fats. Drink plenty of water to keep the body hydrated and maintain a balanced diet to remain at a preferred body shape.
Tips for brides-to-be to follow to look their best for their nuptials 

*Skin preparation is essential for the bride, one week ahead of her wedding. A beautician assists her in her facial care routine.

* Every bride should look her best on her wedding day. Therefore a trial one month before the wedding to discuss the best makeup choice to be applied on her big day has become a necessity.

*I usually give my brides a touch up kit so that they can retouch their makeup during the evening.

Capturing state power through 'mercenaries'
The word politics signifies the struggle for power taking place between individuals or groups of individuals to capture state power. In other words, it means capturing the control of the government. Even though the theoretical definition of the word politics alludes to capturing state power, in actuality, it means capturing the control of the government. Politics, whether it is national or international, has three major objectives. First is the capturing of state power. Second is maintaining the power thus captured and the third is the constant attempt to further expand that power. So, it becomes evident that politics and capturing state power are intertwined and connected to each other in such a degree that they cannot be separated.
It is accepted that there are two ways of engaging in the game of politics. The first method is to do it democratically and the second method is to use revolutionary means. The main method of engaging in democratic politics is through elections while armed struggles along with the use of bullets become the major tools or means of engaging in politics conducted through a revolution. While democratic politics is carried out with the participation of the civil society a revolutionary political process is carried out through the participation of armed revolutionaries or mercenaries. The ballot becomes the main element of democratic politics while the bullet becomes the main element of revolutionary politics. Where openness is one of the main qualities of democratic politics, secretiveness becomes important for revolutionary politics. Democratic politics is carried out with the mass participation of the people while revolutionary politics will be carried out with the limited participation of individuals. Other than these two methods, the other means of capturing state power is by way of a military coup which will be carried out under the auspice of military personnel.
Attempt to capture State power
Hence, the nature of political science is as such and I penned down this as a way of introduction due to the warped political means used by the Joint Opposition to topple the current government and capture state power as Operation Colombo was ideologically as well as pragmatically fraught. The major problem associated with this Janabalaya Colambata is that it is hard to understand whether this was conducted on democratic lines or revolutionary lines. The main objective of the Colombo Protest was to use anti-government protesters to Occupy Colombo. The leaders of the Joint Opposition in an immature way believed that this force will exert pressure on the ruling government and thereby topple allowing them to capture state power. In other words, the Joint Opposition wanted to overthrow the good governance government and establish a government under the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa. When looked at in this light, the operation carried out by the Joint Opposition to capture state power stands in contrast to the democratic means and falls more in line with so-called revolutionary means of gaining power.
Lack of political knowledge
But when we critically look at how Operation Colombo was carried out, it becomes clear that it was a revolution carried out on a very shallow and nominal basis as the main elements of a proper revolution were absent. In short, Operation Colombo failed to show any characteristics of a fully-fledged political revolution at ideological, theoretical and pragmatic levels. Moreover, if any person believes that state power in a country where over 20 million people live will change hands due to twenty to thirty thousand people shouting anti-government slogans along with the hackneyed line stating that we need a government headed by his Highness Mahinda Rajapaksa, it is apt to state that such individuals have no idea about politics or associated power struggles.
So, due to all these factors, Operation Colombo showed that the leaders of the Joint Opposition lack any form of political literacy when it comes to engaging in political games to capture state power. Operation Colombo was mainly done by using the power of rhetoric and nothing else. Even though rhetoric plays a role in the game for power, the stalwarts of the Joint Opposition were unable to comprehend that bombastic rhetoric alone will not suffice to overthrow a government and capture power. Therefore, this whole operation became utterly meaningless and devoid of any practical value other than one which made boisterously loud empty noises.
But the most important highlight of this whole operation was the attempt to use mercenaries and overthrow a democratically elected government out of power as around 95% of the soldiers who participated in this faade were mercenaries. They were lured into this event with the promise of free transport, alcohol, a food packet and a bit of money. Many of those who participated had no idea about Operation Colombo and why it was even organised. So, these mercenaries were like coconut husks ebbing about in the vast ocean which stands in stark contrast to revolutionaries with strong political objectives in mind. This whole failed political faade eventually showed that the stalwarts of the Joint Opposition are extremely politically immature. They failed to understand that a difficult task like changing a government and capturing state power cannot be done with the help of mere mercenaries. Again and again, it constantly exposed how the leaders of the Joint Opposition lack any form of political literacy and how backward they are in their political thinking. Machiavelli, a much renowned Italian political philosopher in his revered book The Prince elucidated the uselessness of attempting to capture state power with the help of mercenaries (as was the case with the Joint Opposition) and his ideas can be aptly used when analyzing this particular failed protest.
Machiavellis analysis
Machiavelli analyzes as to how a Prince should create a strong military power and base. The Prince can either build up this power by creating a national army consisting of civilians living within that space or by using mercenaries. But building power with the help of mercenaries can be dangerous and a Prince will not get the required strong foundation and stability to rule over the state as mercenaries become heroes only when there are no enemies. When there are enemies, at any given point of time, without any shame, they will conspire and betray the Prince for their personal benefits as they fight because of money/benefits they receive as opposed to personal glory. Therefore, once the mercenaries receive a higher payment they will without a second thought betray anyone. Therefore, mercenaries will only fight when there is no war and if a war does arise within the state, they will definitely leave the Prince and go. So, a Prince must take action to create a national army which will fight for the nation, state, religion, honour and glory. Such an army will fight to protect the Prince till the last moment without abandoning or betraying him.
Machiavellis description and analysis of the behavioural patterns relating to mercenaries are quite similar to the behaviour of the mercenaries brought to Colombo by the Joint Opposition.
Those mercenaries were ready to sacrifice their lives in order to overturn the current government but that was only in their drunken stupor. Once the drunken stupor left them, they forgot the main purpose of the operation, which was to overthrow the government and establish Mahinda Rajapaksha back on the throne, and went back home. Thus, when it was nearing midnight, they betrayed the much awaited revolution of capturing Colombo and went back without even informing their leaders. When we look at the chain of events, it shows how politically illiterate, backward thinking and immature the leaders of the Joint Opposition are. Other than being bombastic, they had no real pragmatic modus operandi. As the Colombo Operation cannot be either categorized as a democratic means of changing a government or a revolutionary means of doing so, this whole operation amounts to being a hollow and shallow one. Eventually, it became another farcical nonsensical rhetorical faade carried out by wasting millions of rupees. It turned the whole of Colombo into a public lavatory and further strengthened the Wickremesinghe-Sirisena government.

## Title: THE CASE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN SRI LANKA
## Supertitle:

THE CASE FOR A CONSTITUTIONAL COURT IN SRI LANKA
In most developed countries in the world, Constitutional Courts or Constitutions Councils have been set up with the prime motive of dispensing crucial constitutional matters by going though judicial reviews. In the words of political scientists, a constitutional court is a high court, that deals exclusively with constitutional law. Its main function is to determine independently with sound caution whether the laws and enactments brought before the parliaments or legislatures are constitutionally valid. When they are challenged by various quarters, social groups and citizens the constitutional courts should decide whether those laws or resolutions are in conflict with constitutionally established rules, rights and freedoms, among other things.
In short, a constitutional court is an independent and autonomous state authority which carries-out constitutional review. It is well defined by constitutional expert, ALEC STONE SWEET as a constitutionally established, independent organ of the state whose central purpose is to defend the normative superiority of constitutional law within the juridical order.
History of constitutional courts
The recorded history of constitutional courts reveals that the first constitutional court was established by the First Austrian Republic in 1919. The Czechoslovakian Constitution of 1920, which came into effect on February 2, 1920, also established a dedicated constitutional court for judicial review of parliamentary affairs.
The Supreme Court of the United States of America is also equally regarded as a pioneer supreme court because it is regarded and honoured as a pioneer court in the world to invalidate a law as unconstitutional (MARLBURY VS MADISON). It is still maintaining the same status as a constitutional authority.
The concept or a proposal for the setting up of a constitutional court for Sri Lanka is NOT a new thing.
The 1972 first republication constitution, a brain child of Dr. Colvin R De Silva established a constitutional court under clause (54) of the new constitution. This constitution is firmly regarded as a home grown constitution, as it emerged through a constitutional assembly especially carved out for this purpose.
Clause 54(01) reads as thus:
There shall be a Constitutional Court for the performance of functions assigned to it by the constitution. The President shall appoint, for a term of four years, five persons to be members of the Constitutional Court. Whatever occasion arises for the determination of any matter arising under section subsection (2) of this section or of section (55) three members of the Constitutional Court chosen in accordance with the rules of the Constitutional Court for decision if-
(a) The Attorney General communicates his opinion to the Speaker under section 53; or
(b) The Speaker receives within a week of the Bill being placed on the Agenda of the National State Assembly a written notice raising such a question signed by the leader in the National State Assembly of a recognized political party; or
(c) The question is raised within a week of the Bill being placed on the Agenda of the National State Assembly by written notice addressed to the Speaker and signed by at least such number of members of the National State Assembly as would constitute a quorum of the National State Assembly ; or
(d) The Speaker or, when he is unable perform the functions of his office, the Deputy Speaker takes the view that there is such a question; or
(e) The Constitutional Court on being moved by any citizen within a week of the Bill being placed on the Agenda of the National State Assembly, advises the Speaker that there is such a question.
(3) No proceedings shall be had in the National State Assembly in relation to a Bill referred to the Constitutional Court under sub-section (2) of this section or of section(55) until the decision of the Constitutional Court under sub-section (4) of this section or its opinion under section 55has been given.
(4) The decision of the Constitutional Court upon a reference under section (2) of this section shall bind the Speaker and shall be conclusive for all purposes. No institution administering justice and likewise no other institution, person or authority shall have the power or jurisdiction to inquire into, pronounce upon or in any manner call in question a decision of the Constitutional Court.
55(4) If the Constitutional Court advises the Speaker that this Bill or any provision therein is inconsistent with the Constitution or that the Constitutional Court entertains a doubt whether the Bill or any provision therein is inconsistent with the Constitution such Bill shall not pass into law except with the special majority required for the amendment of the Constitution.
The following bills were referred to the first constitutional court thus established under the 1972 first republican constitution. (a) SRI LANKA PRESS COUNCIL BILL (b) BRIBERY (SPECIAL JURISDICTION) BILL (c) PLACES AND OBJECTS OF WORSHIP BILL (d) ASSOCIATED NEWSPAPERS OF CEYLON, LTD(SPECIAL PROVISION) BILL & (e) ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE BILL .
J.R. Jayewardene assumed political power in 1977 and in 1978 a new constitution was drafted and came into being, without going through a constituent assembly. The rationale behind the making of this constitution was to create a weak parliament and a strong Executive President.
However, even the United National Party which backed the 1978 constitution totally without questioning a single clause in the 02nd Republican Constitution now takes the leadership with other co-partners in the parliament to move for a new constitution. It insists that the executive presidential system of government with wide powers inherent in a single person is not suitable for a parliamentary system of government. It should be noted here, with appreciation that some of the powers exercised by the President were removed when the new government came in to power in 2015. The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna very rightly had moved a private members motion in the parliament to do away with the executive presidential system of government and also to move all parties to establish an entirely a new constitution in accordance with enshrined principles of democracy, human and fundamental values.
One of the first critics of the executive system of presidential government was Dr. N. M. Perera, who is widely regarded as an constitutional authority. In this connection, the scientific analysis he is making in the CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE 1978 CONSTITUTION IN SRI LANKA, is significant and the failure of the present constitution was analytically predicted long ago, actually speaking in the drafting stage of the present constitution.
The Jayewardene constitution
Dr. Colvin R De Silva, who has written a splendid forward to this valuable thesis says In 1931 both males and females above the age of 21 in Sri Lanka were enfranchised. Thereafter, the 1948 constitution which granted Dominion status to Sri Lanka established a comprehensive parliamentary system of the British model. The status of the Governor approximated to that of the British constitutional monarch. The real centre of governmental power was the Cabinet of ministers, headed by the prime minister who functioned with responsibility to, and in accord with, the parliament. .The Jayewardene constitution abolished the concentration of state power in the National State Assembly, now renamed Parliament, and reposed such power in an executive president elected directly by the people. With state power decisively in the Presidents hand and with Parliament relegated to second place, there arises a dualism of power between the President and Parliament. ..As indicated by Dr. N.M. Perera, such a conflicting situation that could arise out of the constitutional relationship between an elected president and an elected Parliament is a clear possibility.
As predicted by Dr. N.M. Perera very correctly we have seen these conflicts happening throughout with the present system of government. This trend has hampered smooth functioning of democratic governance. Although the 1978 constitution consists only 117 pages, amendments of it goes up to more than 100 pages. This a classic example of the distorted legal character of this constitution. 17, 18 and 19 Amendments also can be classified as evidence of the unworthiness of this constitution. It is full of loopholes of the highest magnitude. Constitutional analysts are also of the opinion, that even the Supreme Court was perplexed, whether the 13th Amendment was consistent or not with the parameters of the 1978 constitution.
Therefore, it is clear that inherent weaknesses, legal impediments and excessive authority and concentration of power in the hands of a single person of the above pattern could have been avoided with the presence of a legally instituted constitutional court. I suggest that the drafters of the proposed new constitution will pay their attention to this piece of legislation and allow the citizens of this country to challenge any bill or act which undermine peoples power, before a constitutional court.
In this connection I would like to invite the attention of the interested groups and scholars to a considered view of eminent legal eagle, Dr Nihal Jayawickrema one time the Secretary of the Ministry of Justice- The proposal to set up a Constitutional Court, at the apex of our judicial system, may well serve as a catalyst for change, but only if it is realistically constituted and its establishment is accompanied by vitally necessary reforms in respect of the language of the law and in establishing judicial accountability. One immediate consequence of the establishment of a constitutional court will also be to enable the other superior and first instance courts to focus entirely on civil, commercial and criminal litigation. That task, of course, need to be facilitated by long overdue structural and systematic reforms, responsibilities which neither the Ministry of Justice, nor the judiciary, has so far demonstrated any indication to undertake.

CID GRILLS GOTA OVER NOYAHRS ABDUCTION
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was questioned by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) for around three and a half hours from 9.30 am to around 2.00 pm yesterday, according to the CID.
Rajapaksa arrived at the CID last morning on being summoned by the CID to record a statement on the abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr.
At the previous court hearing, the Attorney General informed that it was necessary to record statements from both former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and former Army Commander and present minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
A CID source said that the former Army Commander Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka would also be summoned to the CID to record a statement from him pertaining to the Noyahr case in the near future.
Earlier, the CID also grilled former President Mahinda Rajapaksa at his official residence on August 17, for nearly three hours in connection with the abduction and torture of journalist Keith Noyahr.
Earlier the CID team had also travelled to Australia to obtain a statement from Noyahr.
Journalist Keith Noyahr was abducted from near his home on Waidya Road, Dehiwela on May 22, 2008 and was subsequently released several days later having been tortured severely.
Last year six Army officers were arrested over the abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyhar but were later released on bail.
Former military intelligence chief retired Major General Amal Karunasekara was also arrested and remanded over the case and was granted bail last Tuesday.

Citizens' Mail
Thank you, Indian government
I am very happy to see the quick expansion of the Suwaseriya free ambulance service across the island receiving many accolades from the people who have been benefitted by it. I thank the Indian Premier Narendra Modi for his generous gift of US $ 7.5 million initially to start it in the Western and Southern Provinces in 2016. The gift included 88 ambulances with training cost and operational expenditure for one year.
Although there were tremendous backlashes against this exemplary and meritorious service, its achievements were great helping the suffering patients.
Suwaseriya Free Ambulance service hitherto has serviced 91,547 patients in emergency situations which is a record, breaking the severe criticism of the JO members of the Mahinda camp.
It should be ludicrous and shameful for the Mahinda cronies that they could not do anything beneficial to the people in health or educational or people-oriented programmes during their tenure of office for two decades. At least they could not implement the Senaka Bibiles drug policy introduced by President Maithripala Sirisena when he was the Minister of Health which could have brought relief to the poor patients in reduction of the prices of drugs. But now, Mahinda cronies have become the worst braggers holding protests and demonstrations to woo the support of the innocent people to win in elections and try to fool them again.
Hence, I request the people of our country to think twice and refrain from rallying around them. I thank again the Indian Government and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for this worthy and meritorious service and request to provide the service to Kegalle district as soon as possible.

Country must adopt sustainable housing policy - President
The country's existing housing policy should move towards constructing apartments in suburban and rural areas, in compliance with issues relating to the environment and land use, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
President Sirisena pointed out that it is extremely important to adopt a sustainable housing policy when planning settlement development projects in the suburban and rural areas.
Eventhough the population rate increases, our lands do not expand. Our country is a small island. We are not able to continue with developing villages allocating land plots for each house. We do not have enough land available for that anymore, not only in the urban but in t herural areas as well.Apartments are a better solution to solve the land issue, the President further pointed out.
President Sirisena pointed out that the national housing policy has been properly implemented under the present government unlike in the past.
Even though there are some good housing policies, most of our people do not like to abide by them. People also take advantage of the weak construction and housing policies existing in the country. Land availability is dwindling every day. Its important that we safeguard the remaining lands, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena made these observations participating in the ceremony held to hand over the Lake Crest Residencies, a housing project with 500 apartment units, to the public at Mulleriyawa, Mandawila. The housing project is constructed under the directions of Megapolis and Western Development Ministry together with financial and planning contributions by the Urban Development Authority.
The forest density of the country at present is 27%. Each year, the forest density decreases by 1.5%. If we continue at this rate, in the next 10 years, we will have a forest density only of 18%-19% or so. In about 25 years, our country would become a desert. There would be no difference between the Middle Eastern countries and ours. Therefore, it is crucial that we adopt a construction and housing policy which recognises the importance of forest conservation, the President added.
Speaking further, President Sirisena observed that the present government had to bear the burden of not only of one, but many garbage mountains, when it took over from the previous Rajapaksa regime.
The government had to face the Meetotamulla garbage dump tragedy. But, the Meetotamulla dump was not created by our government, but it was us who had to pay for it. When we took over, Sri Lanka had lost all its international allies. That was another garbage mountain we had to clear. We have now won the support of many countries. SAITM was another garbage mountain we had to deal with. Many have criticised and mocked this government but these are some of the issues we had to overcome, President Sirisena added.
President Sirisena commended Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka for the exceptional commitment he is making to uplift the living standards of the people by implementing solid infrastructure and development projects.
Colombo district UNP MP S.M.Marikkar and Kolonnawa Development Committee Co-Chairman Prasanna Solangarachchi were also present at the occasion.

Jehan Aloysius and his team at CentreStage Productions recently conducted a unique Kids Summer Drama Camp at their CentreStage Space. The event was only promoted on social media and sold out within a just few days with 30 students being selected for participation. The lucky children were ages 9 - 13 years of age.
The workshop activities were theatre based and used theatre techniques and activities to encourage creative expression and performance skills. Jehan Aloysius infused the workshops with unique elements and themes so the participants would be constantly engaged and inspired.
African musical instruments, chanting, movements and costume play were just some of these elements. The participants created, directed and performed mini-presentations as well. Creative use of masks, making costumes and group activities were also explored.
All those who completed the workshop were given certificate at the end of the camp. As Jehan states, The 2018 Kids Summer Drama Camp was a success. We had so many messages, phone calls and posts about the workshop from parents who have requested that we continue this more regularly. We are happy to announce that we have plans to conduct a December Holiday Drama Camp with a new exciting theme and activities for kids 9 - 14 years of age.

Enterprise Sri Lanka goes to Deraniyagala
The governments Enterprise Sri Lanka programme aims to resolve long-standing problems of the people, especially unemployment among rural youths, said Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim.
A special meeting was held at the auditorium of the Deraniyagala Pradeshiya Sabha under the patronage of Minister Hashim to introduce the Enterprise Sri Lanka project.
The present government is the unfortunate inheritor of the unsolved problems of the previous regime, which include a national debt of over Rs. 7 billion, he said.
This government is therefore not the author of these problems. The present Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has taken measures to systematically relieve the country of the burdens and problems created by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government. Now his focus is on the issues at grassroots level  that is, the problems faced by the masses and the unemployment of youth in the country, the Minister said.
Enterprise Sri Lanka which targets the creation of 100,000 entrepreneurs is designed mainly to assist educated, unemployed prospective young entrepreneurs. Under this scheme, as many as 16 loan schemes based on no interest and low interest re-payment facilities have been introduced to aid prospective entrepreneurs.
The Minister said that ordinarily obtaining a loan from a bank is not easy. The borrower has to furnish guarantors and collaterals. But under the Enterprise Sri Lanka project, the entire process is streamlined to expedite the granting of loans. Special officers have been assigned by banks to help the loan applicants. In case the borrowers experience difficulties, they can inform the designated officers who will assist them, Minister Hashim said.
He hoped that 100,000 prospective entrepreneurs would make use of the opportunity for their own benefit and that of the country, the Minister said.
He said that he hopes that over 1,000 entrepreneurs in his area would come forward to make use of the benefits offered by Enterprise Sri Lanka.

FEB to upgrade with ERP
The Foreign Employment Bureau (FEB) will implement the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to make its services and management process more efficient.
Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando told the media yesterday, that the ERP system will help to automate many back office functions related to services and human resources.
The Minister said that their intention was not to cancel the Family Background Report (FBR) but to bring in amendments. He said the FBR had paved way for more forgery.
We are focused on finding ways to curb the raising problems pertaining to foreign employment, he said.
A sub committee has been appointed to look into this matter and the first meeting would be held on September 27. Fernando said he was personally against sending women as housemaids for work and requested not to look everything from a political perspective. The Ministry is planning to send semi - skilled employees to put an end to sending house maids, he said.
Fernando made an inspection tour to the Foreign Employment Bureau and said that there were many issues that needed immediate attention. I made several suggestions for improvement but nothing has been implemented so far. I made an unannounced visit to the Bureau to check on it, he said.
Responding to a question about cancelling employment agencies involved in forgery, he said there were many issues concerning them and said stern action will be taken against the offenders.

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Thursday, September 13, 2018 - 01:00
Fundamental problem  of money and banking; how to fix it
The problem being the unsecured money-dominant monetary system
The foundation of modern monetary economies is the money and banking which have evolved together in markets. They cannot be separated and will continue to evolve together. Their new phase is the electronic environment whose benefits, costs and risks will be fully experienced, probably in the next decade. Everybody knows the great facility provided by money and banks to economic activities and living standards of the human-being. We all can think of the catastrophe we will confront if a banking black-out suddenly happens for a week.
The monetary literature shows that the present paper-based money was invented by banks as gold-backed private moneys in their business in the 16thto 19thcenturies. Such private moneys were later unified and nationalized by creating the legal tender (state money), state central banks and bank regulations since the beginning of the 20th century in order to prevent production of too much private money backed by too little gold reserves and resulting money and banking crises happening from time to time and to keep the economies and societies prospering under the state monetary systems.
However, the production of money by banks as well as money and banking crises have continued as before. Banks re-started producing or creating book-keeping money in official monetary units backed by too little reserves of legal tender through their business of lending and borrowing. The volume of such bank money constitutes the majority of money in circulation and runs modern monetary systems. For example, the bank-created money is nearly five times the officially printed money in Sri Lanka, UK and USA and it is three times in the Euro area. With electronic banking and payment systems now advancing, it will exceed 95%of money in the near futureby leaving central banks and governments virtually incapable of controlling the money stock. If money createdby shadow banks and financial markets is considered, the volume of official/state money is already a negligible portion in the economy.
The bank-created money is almost unsecured money with reserves less than 10%. This can be understood by looking at the balance sheet of banks.The balance sheet of banks generally contains liquid or demand liabilities (deposits and short-term debt) more than 90% which are the private bank money. On the asset side of the balance sheet, cash reserves (cash at hand and deposits with the central bank) are not more than 10% of the balance sheet. The balance assets contain various risky assets dominated by loans constituting 80% to 85% of the balances sheet. So-called liquid assets such as Treasuries and short-term funds which have been developed in place of cash reserves held by old banks to protect currency systems are also subject to various risks during banking system stresses. Even Treasuries are credit to governments which can go bankrupt as the world literature shows. The total value of such liquid assets of banks does not generally exceed 20% of their deposits and debts or demand liabilities.
This shows that only less than 10% of bank assets is available in cash/legal tender reserves to repay demand liabilities of more than 90% of bank assets/balance sheet in an eventuality. Therefore, the interest and role of shareholders with limited liability in banks (capital being less than 10% of the balance sheet) are only book entries that can vanish at any time. In the circumstance, the notion of shareholder value has no place in banks as banks operate on depositor value at risk. As such, the fundamental problem of money and banking is the unsecured bank money dominance in the economy which results money and banking crises from time to time.The last global financial crisis 2007/09 has refreshed terrible experiences of money and banking crises and its recovery of the world economy is not complete even after 10 years. During banking crises, private/bank money evaporates causing credit and liquidity crunches overnight which will drag economies into recessionslingering at least a decade. Therefore, the core of the modern monetary economies remainsto be the bankingwhich produces money and runs monetary systems.
The protection of depositor-trust to fix the problem
Given their nature of inherently risky business and fundamental problem in money and banking, no bank is immune to banking crises. However, banks can operate in such a risky environment because depositors and creditors regularly demand only a small portion of their funds at banks as they have a general trust that banks will pay-back their money when needed at any time. This trust has nothing to do with technical financial soundness of banks. They do not know fashionable risk management systems or financial hygiene of banks as shown in bank financial statements prepared and disclosed in technical jargon that even professional accountants and risk managers will not understand. None of financial media provides comments on financial hygiene of banks based onsuch financial statements. Depositors also do not know what exact role the state regulators play to protect their funds although they generally expect the state to bailout them in catastrophic situation as usual even in the case of failures of unauthorized shadow banks.
In normal times of the economies, the trust poses no threats as the majority public need banks for their routine life. However, the trust is an accumulated state of mentality of both bad and good that customers feel on their transactions and interactions with banks. In every instance, the customer gets a feeling how the bank cares for his or her money. Most depositors do not take troubles in frequently shopping across banks to find the bank that best cares them due to documentation difficulties and general trust prevailing in the banking system. However, in any eventuality, bad feelings will blow-up the trust and hit banks.
The nature of the banking business is such that the trust-blasts are highly contagious across banks and they cannot be predicted. Such instances are the bank-runs. In modern banking, we will see a physical bank run by way of ques in front of a bank only after the run has already attacked the bank electronically through the internet banking. No bank can expect to go free in the event of a banking panic. Therefore, the depositor trust is a highly fragile and irrational mental condition that all banks must be careful of.
As such, the solution available with the most of us to fix the fundamental problem of money and banking is the protection of the trust of bank depositors and creditors who hold the unsecured bank money. It is no secret that the protection of depositor trust in banks is nothing but the protection of banks and the banking industry although most bank staff may not be mindful of.
Banks toprotect the Depositor-trust:Some Thoughts
Given above factsin modern money and banking, banks need to organize their business affairs with an explicit target of protecting the depositor trust in both respective banks and banking industry as a whole.The conventional accounting-based regulations such as capital/solvency, liquidity/liquid assets, provisions/impairment and thousands of other rules, sophisticated risk management techniques and corporate governance practices cannot guarantee the depositor trustbecause depositors are not aware of the compliance level of banks with any of those. None of regulators or bank directors or managers know all those rules, techniques and practices which are not traceable and interpretable in one readable document and, therefore, banking business is de-facto free. Whatever financial numbers and risk indicators that banks prepare and regulators, auditors and rating agenciescheck on random basis are only paper work that nobody can read and fully understand the causes and symptoms of vulnerabilities of banks that are causedby dark corners of bankswhich become known only after they hit the banks.The post-mortem of the last global financial crisis is still not decisive and complete.
The reality is that even global banks have fallen into bailing-out hands of tax payers from time to time as those systems had not been effective and efficient. In todays business accounting and innovative banking products, it is extremely difficult to know the actually realized value of banking businesses as against sophisticated fair value arrived at based on models and discretions whichis intellectual accounting work that has nothing to do with the layman customer trust. Even banks with chronic ailments of accounting insolvency, illiquidity and losses can be in business in normal times as long as depositors and creditors are not panic. Therefore, banks need to practice a set of common sense banking for keeping and nurturing the depositor/public trust in banks.A few thoughts what I believe as important in that direction are presented below.
lGrow Slowly
Banks have to be in business for generations standalone or merging with some other banks without interruption to customer transactions. In banking business, private bank money or demand liabilities,which are perceivedby those depositorsas riskless,are created through grant of longer-term loans which are risky to banks as loans cannot be recovered on demand. This risk-mismatch is the systemic risk that all banks confront and causes bank runs in the event depositor trust is lost.The quality of classes of bank assets and capital adequacy are intellectual concepts used to protect the technical solvency of banks in the long run. The government assumes the liability of only printed money which is only one unit out of each six units in the money stock. Therefore, banks have to assume the liability of the bank-created money or deposits in the money stock as the state liability bearing cash reserve held by the banking system is mostly less than10% of total deposits. In final analysis, both classes of liabilities are only paper-based writings as no real assets such as gold or other valuables are guaranteed to redeem such moneys. Therefore, banks have todriveslowly. Pushing the accelerator hard means creation ofbank money too much and too faster that could topple banks and economies in a short time in the event the systemic risk hits.
lStay away from Trading
Banks should not get into asset markets for trading profit or hedging banking books because they add further risks of speculation to already risky business of banks. Assets markets are highly speculative and asset price bubbles have been the cause of almost all banking crises in the literature. If a bank reports impressive or sugar-high financial results from gains (realized and unrealized) on assets, it is not a bank but a trading organization which can go bust at any time. At present, many global banks are struggling on their trading portfolios to manage adverse impact of market movements on their financial reports, despite cuttingthem down significantly after the last global financial crisis. This is the area where banking history shows a massive scale of rouge trades, insider dealings and market manipulations inclusive of rates-fixing scandals.
lBe Cautious in Innovations in Products and Delivery Channels
Innovations in products and delivery modes should be cautious as they often lead to mis-selling, cross-selling and distant customer relationships. Nobody thought that the complex structured products which revolutionized the banking landscape with financial engineering in advanced market economies in 1990s would cause once-in-a-century financial Tsunami in August 2007. Similarly, electronic banking services that banks have commenced to offer competitively through mobile Applications (Apps) are calling for immense risks to customer trust.
First, customer information confidentiality is seen virtually breached as the mobile phone companies, App providers and cloud-keepers are smart in monitoring customer financial transactions regularly through a global network of content mangers and using such information for various profit motives of third parties.
The best example is the recent revelation of the Facebook consequent to the Cambridge Analytica scandal that has now caused risks, not only to the Facebook but also to the social media industry, due to both regulators and fraudulent users/subscribers. Second, the risk of robing customer funds by electronic bank robbers is extremely high, given the massive development of the hacking industry. Any transaction taken place through the internet is a cyber foot-print to hackers. In such instances, customer-conflict resolution is extremely difficultas it ends up atlaw enforcement authorities. The recent story of hacking a central bank account at the New York Fed Reserve through so much trusted SWIFT, which would have ended up in an electronic robbery of nearly a billion of US$ unless a small Sri Lankan bank detected it from its manual internal controls (not sophisticated IT risk controls), is a good example for banks who have the god-like-trust in e-banking.
The leakage or supply of customer financial profiles in electronic files to internal marketing teams and external parties is also a considerable operational risk to both banks and customers because nobody knows the final destination of such information and its use.
Third, various fees charged by banks are raising the cost of money transactions, confusions and bad feelings. For example, new fees charged for over-the-counter-transactions as against the use electronic modes such as ATMs and Apps-based banking are against the basic relationship-based banking, especially as banks cannot guarantee the security of electronic modes. An adult coming to a bank branch with a pass-book to deposit or withdraw a small sum less than Rs. 100,000 becomes desperate when he or she sees bank notices advising customers to go to ATMs for deposits and withdrawals below Rs. 100,000 or pay a fee, i.e., Rs. 20 or Rs. 30, for each such cash withdrawal from the branch counter.
A similar instance is when a bank all of sudden asks for a fee of Rs. 100 for an internal fund transfer between two accounts of a customer in the same bank or advise the customer to get the internet banking facility to have such fund transfers free of charge.
The modern IT is for the young whereas the majority retail customer base is the other two generations that banks have to bank on. Hope that banks may not start moving to modern robotic and artificial intelligence environment to claim more efficient and convenient banking for better customer relationship. Therefore, it is advisable that banks identify digital customers separately and provide e-banking to them with required legal safeguards without penalizing the rest. Otherwise, e-banking products might get into allegations of mis-selling later.

We are proud to have seen positive development in Ho Chi Minh City market, and this paves the way for us to expand our services to Hanoi, Go-Viet co-founder and managing director Nguyen Vu Duc said at Wednesdays launch.
The launch followed an announcement by the company in May that it would invest US$500 million to enter the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam, following Ubers deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to bigger regional player Grab. On Tuesday, Grab announced a partnership with Vietnams MOCA Technology and Service company (Moca) for a mobile payment service, as the ride-hailing firm pushes to cement its position.

Govts new industry  goals to spur tourism
Sri Lankas position as a tourist destination will be further consolidated with the newly set industry targets, which include four million tourist arrivals, 600, 000 direct employments and US $ 7 billion revenue from tourism in 2020, said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga.
He was speaking at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Tourism to unveil the Tourism Leaders Summit and International Tourism Research Conference 2018, to be held on October 4-5 at BMICH.
The Tourism conference is being organized by the Alumni Association of Tourism Economics and Hospitality Management and the students of the Tourism Study Programs of the Department of Economics, University of Colombo for the fourth consecutive year in Sri Lanka. This coincides with the official ceremony of UNWTO World Tourism Day in Sri Lanka.
The Minister said he is confident that the tourism conference 2018 will provide an opportunity for constructive dialogue on tourism policy development measures while ensuring sustainable tourism development activities in Sri Lanka which will help prepare the industry to achieve the two-fold growth of arrivals in to the country.
While we work towards making Sri Lanka tourism as the leading revenue generator of the country, we must also be conscious of not killing the goose that lays the golden egg in the process of managing our tourism resources. In addition we need to maintain our cultural integrity, ecological process, biological diversity and life support systems that sustain our tourism assets, he said.
According to the Minister, development of sustainable tourism is a key aspect to the long- term sustainability of the industry and industry needs best brains in the country to map out routes to sustainability while meeting the needs of the tourist stakeholders.
We need to focus on engaging the local communities in promotions and sustainable development through capacity building. We have to look at sustainable promotion of potential sectors while increasing the opportunities for social contacts.
Minister also pointed out that it is also imperative to adopt business practices, which will lead to realize sustainable tourism goals particularly to achieve the UN Sustainable Development goals.
He also said that tourism has become the passport to prosperity of many countries and Sri Lanka is no exception. However, he said that prosperity will depend on how Sri Lanka manage local tourism sector.
This is where we require the inputs of academics in order to ensure and enshrine sustainability at every level of eco tourism, he said.

Healthy Dining Out
Eating at a restaurant doesn't have to sabotage your healthy diet. Use smart-eating strategies: Plan ahead, consider the menu and choose foods carefully.
Preparation
Have a plan. Eat a light dinner if you ate a big lunch that day. Or, if you know ahead of time that you're going to a restaurant, plan to have lighter meals during the day. Knowing menu terms and cooking basics makes ordering easier, especially if you have special dietary needs.
Choosing a Restaurant
Think ahead. Consider meal options at different restaurants and look for places with a wide range of menu items. Check online menus, if available, for nutrition information ahead of time.
Ordering
Be deliberate when ordering. Balance your meal by including healthier selections from all the different food groups such as lean protein foods, low-fat dairy, fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Look for freshly made entre salads that give you "balance in a bowl." For example, entre salads with baked or grilled chicken, beans or seafood provide protein along with fiber and other nutrients. Ask for dressing on the side so you can control the portion size.
For sandwich toppings, go with veggie options including lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion; if using condiments, choose ketchup, mustard, relish or salsa.
Round out your meal by ordering healthy side dishes, such as a side salad, baked potato or fruit. Boost the nutritional value of your baked potato by topping it with vegetables, salsa or chili.
Substitute 
Ask for a side salad with dressing on the side to replace fries in a combination meal. Many restaurants honor requests, so don't be afraid to be assertive, ask menu questions and make special requests to meet your nutritional needs.
Control portions 
Many restaurants serve huge portions, sometimes enough for two or three people. Eat a smaller portion and bring leftovers home for another meal. Or, order an appetizer in place of an entre and add a small soup or salad.
Eating
Eat slowly. It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to get the message from your stomach that you are no longer hungry. Fast eaters often are overeaters, while slow eaters tend to eat less and are still satisfied.
Eating Out with Kids
Choose a restaurant that caters to children. This will increase the likelihood that a restaurant has a healthy children's menu that includes smaller portion sizes and meals designed to provide ample nourishment for smaller bodies.
For new foods, offer a bite or two from your order. Otherwise, let kids order their familiar favorites when they eat out. Pick two or three suitable menu items and then let your child pick one.
Substitute healthier sides in place of fries, such as carrots or apple slices, or share an order of fries, and order plain foods with sauce on the side.
Calcium is important at all ages, but especially for growing bones. To get more calcium, opt for plain or chocolate milk for a beverage, or add a slice of cheese to their sandwich. Choose dairy-based desserts such as yogurt or a smoothie.
Restaurants may be intimidating to people trying to stick to a healthy eating plan, but with preparation and confidence you can enjoy your restaurant meal without abandoning healthy eating. - eatright

## Title: High taxes fuel illicit trade
## Supertitle: RIU report on cigarette smuggling:
## Section: Features

RIU report on cigarette smuggling:
High taxes fuel illicit trade
Cigarettes are one of the most smuggled legal products in the world, and cigarette smuggling is a form of transnational organised crime (US Department of State, 2015). Evidence shows many high-profile terrorist organisations such as Al-Qaeda operate smuggling rings due to higher profit margins and relatively lower risk (US Department of State, 2015).
Sri Lankas having one of the highest cigarette prices in the region has led the country into the hands of illegal cigarette smugglers who make huge profits. The trend of consistent tax hikes from 20092015 created the ground for a large and unprecedented hike in 2016 which hampered the objectives of both the Health Ministry and the Finance Ministry.
High taxes play a significant role in incentivising the smuggling of cigarettes, the Research Intelligence Units (RIU) 2018 report Towards Sensible Policy Reforms to Combat Illicit Tobacco Markets said.
In the context of Sri Lanka, the price differential between legal and illicit is about Rs. 25 per stick for cigarettes and about Rs. 2 per stick for beedi, it says, while the distribution of illicit cigarettes is much easier and more organised than that of drugs such as heroin.
Illicit tobacco market
Estimating the size of the current illicit tobacco market is a crucial step towards benchmarking and assessing the effectiveness of actions to curb the growth of the market. Since the illicit market is not directly observable for multifarious reasons, an indirect approach was required to estimate its size.
As per the analysis, the illicit market share is around 14 percent to 18 percent for cigarettes and 26 percent to 29 percent for beedi, which translate to 500 to 700 million sticks of cigarettes and 1,400 to 1,700 million sticks of beedi in 2018.
In other words, the illicit cigarette market turnover could be anywhere between Rs. 15 billion to Rs. 20 billion, which is about 11 percent to 15 percent of the legitimate market size, while illicit beedi market is worth Rs. 4 billion to Rs. 5 billion, which is about five percent to six percent of the legitimate market.
This massive size of the illicit market means loss of revenue for the government, to the industry, and for those whose livelihoods are connected with the tobacco industry, such as tobacco farmers and beedi rollers. In addition to the above, it can be observed that the size of the illicit market has risen to 14 percent or more by 2017. This calls into question the governments policy towards the industry and the efficiency of the enforcement agencies.
RIU says there is strong evidence to suggest higher taxes are a key reason for increased smuggling levels in Sri Lanka. Over the years, there has been a reduction in legitimate cigarette sales, while the consumption of beedi has been increasing. This indicates that consumers are switching to beedi as a cheaper alternative to cigarettes. This took place in the backdrop of a continually increasing excise tax environment. Therefore, it can be concluded that high taxes have a strong connection with the illicit tobacco trade.
According to the authorities and other sources who met during this research, a 40-foot container of smuggled cigarettes can add up to a profit of between Rs. 250 to Rs. 400 million (RIU, 2018). This softer penalty makes the risks associated with smuggling highly acceptable to criminals.
However, the WHO (2012) refutes the claim that higher taxes lead to higher smuggling and states, The link between price and tax differences and large-scale illicit trade is weak; rather, the evidence shows that other enabling factors are more important.
The enabling factors according to WHO are weak governance or lack of high-level commitment; ineffective Customs and excise administration; corruption and complicity of cigarette manufacturers; and presence of informal sectors or informal distribution channels.
Population perceptions and social economic status
However, a recent study done in the US found that there is a correlation between illicit market share and tax rates (Tax Foundation, 2015).
The study states:
Public policies often have unintended consequences that outweigh their benefits. One consequence of high state cigarette tax rates has been increased smuggling as people procure discounted packs from low-tax states to sell in high-tax states. Growing cigarette tax differentials have made cigarette smuggling both a national problem and, in some cases, a lucrative criminal enterprise.
Figure 1 illustrates how smuggled cigarettes move from low-tax jurisdictions to high-tax jurisdictions in the US. The data points (green dots) represent the illicit share in each state. Negative data points indicate outflows, while positive data points indicate inflows. When a trend line (dotted red line) is drawn, it is trending upwards.
Therefore, it is evident that as the cigarette excise tax rate increases (horizontal axis), cigarette smuggling as a percentage of consumption rises (vertical axis).
The illicit tobacco trade has resulted in huge losses to governments in the form of loss of taxes. Building on the analysis in Figure 1, RIU calculated the revenue loss to the government from illicit tobacco.
The loss figures were arrived at by using the extrapolation of income from legitimate tobacco sales.
To put things into perspective, the government has spent close to Rs. 40 billion for the Samurdhi programme last year. The loss of tax revenue from illicit tobacco is equivalent to 27 percent to 40 percent of the annual Samurdhi spending.
Therefore, if converted to legitimate sales, the government could have spent this revenue on productive economic or social activities.

The order regarding an application made by former Minister Johnston Fernando and two others that they be released on bail after setting aside the Kurunegala High Courts order to refuse bail was yesterday reserved for September 17 by the Court of Appeal.
Johnston Fernando and two others remanded in connection with the misappropriation of Rs. 5.2 million in public funds had filed a revision application in the Court of Appeal challenging Kurunegala High Courts order to remand them until the conclusion of the trial.
When the matter came up before Janak de Silva and Justice Achala Wengappuli, both parties concluded their oral submissions.
Senior State Counsel Naomi Wickremasekara appearing for the Attorney General raised objections for the revision application and told court that there is no illegality in the order issued by Kurunegala High Court. SSC Wickremasekara submitted to court that the High Court Judge made this order for the purpose of expediting the trial after being heard on a day-to-day basis. She further argued that bail act does not apply for the offences committed under Public Property Act.
However, President's Counsel Romesh de Silva appearing for Johnston Fernando told court that the High Court Judge made an order to remand the accused without a legal basis. He contended that alleged misappropriation of funds at Lak Sathosa institution cannot be considered as an offence which comes under Public Property Act.
On September 3,the Kurunegala High Court issued an order to remand former Minister Johnston Fernando, former Lak Sathosa Chairman K.M. Fernando and the former Ministers Private Secretary Raj Mohideen Mohamod Sakeer, until the conclusion of the trial.
The Attorney General alleged that Johnston Fernando as then Minister in charge of the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE), had allegedly ordered that goods worth over Rs.5.2 million be released from three CWE warehouses in Yanthampalawa, Wehera and Mallawapitiya in the Kurunegala District during the North Western Provincial Council Election in September 2013.

(JO)KERS in Comedy of Errors!
The title of the Shakespearean comedy, Much Ado About Nothing would have been an apt description for last weeks Janabalaya Colombata (literally, Peoples Power to Colombo) protest launched by the Joint Opposition (JO) and its allied political party, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), better known as the pohottuwa party.
The protest campaign was touted by the JO as having the potential to bring down the government and claims were made that the Presidents House in Fort and Temple Trees, the Prime Ministers official residence in Kollupitiya would be under siege. The JOs plans were also shrouded in secrecy, with even party organisers being told that details of venues would be made known only at the eleventh hour.
In the end such strategies turned out to be ineffective and even JO insiders acknowledged that the protest was a flop as it did not evoke a wave of public support for the party. More importantly, there were several negative aspects in the campaign that highlighted the fact that the JOs popularity noted in the local government elections in February, might now be on the wane.
In the lead up to the protest, the JO accused the government of trying to sabotage it. Of particular concern was the difficulty of obtaining buses to transport protesters to Colombo. The Police also attempted to prevent the protesters from entering areas considered high security zones and made applications to this effect but three courts refused these applications.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, who has kept a low profile in recent times, added some ammunition to the verbal salvos being fired prior to the campaign, stating that protesters should be dealt with severely, if there was a risk that public property could be damaged. It was a clear signal that the government was watching developments earnestly.
Public opinion
For his part, President Maithripala Sirisena chose not to comment on the JOs campaign. Some interpreted this as meaning that he was opting to keep his options open vis--vis a reconciliation with the Rajapaksa faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). On the other hand, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, with characteristic humour, chose to showcase the protest as a depiction of the government allowing democratic dissent. Thus, the protest was being billed as a showdown between the government and the JO and more importantly a political battle of wits.
The protest campaign has several objectives. The JO wanted to test the strength of public opinion against the government and channel those sentiments to its advantage. It was also supposed to be a political debut of sorts for Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, its potential presidential candidate in 2020. Finally, this was also the first major opposition campaign spearheaded by the heir apparent in the Rajapaksa political dynasty, Namal Rajapaksa.
That there was public sentiment against the government was no secret. The burdens of incumbency- skyrocketing prices of essential items, a wave of crippling strikes and failing to meet lofty expectations- ensured that the JO was ideally placed to exploit them. However, they didnt or couldnt and that should be a matter of grave concern for the opposition grouping.
There were several reasons for this. First and foremost, the turnout was far below expectations. Whether this was because the arrangements were shrouded in secrecy or whether it was because the JO was fast losing its appeal is now being hotly debated in the party. It is likely that it was a combination of the two factors.
Secondly, the protest lacked a definite agenda. While the advance publicity was about surrounding Presidents House and Temple Trees and parliamentarian Pavithra Wanniarachchis ridiculous claim that the government will fall overnight, the campaign fizzled out as there was no central event such as a political rally which was the high point of the protest.
In the end, what transpired was a comedy of errors. At the start of the day, when media men asked former President Mahinda Rajapaksa what the plans for the protest were, he categorically stated that it would go on till dawn. To give the older Rajapaksa his due, he appeared optimistic and gave it his all, despite his advancing years.
However, by midnight most protesters had left the Lake House roundabout, which had become the focal point of the protest and the JO had to make do with a candle light vigil which too had to be called off before long.
Dusk to dawn event
Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa was quizzed by the media about this- and his previous promise that the protest would be a dusk to dawn affair and he responded stating that the campaign had gone beyond midnight and was therefore a dusk to dawn event. When politicians resort to such semantics, it is an indication that all is not well.
In contrast to a political rally- which had been the modus operandi of the JO in the past and which had earned them great success- Janabalaya Colombata was also reduced to JO leaders- including Mahinda Rajapaksa- making short impromptu speeches from a mobile microphone. While Rajapaksa gave it his best shot, accusing the government of intimidation, it was a far cry from the racy rhetoric that usually emanates from JO platforms.
The other item on the JOs agenda, the political debut of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, also had mixed results at best. The party faithful did cheer him and some shouted slogans hailing him as the future President but his appearance was brief and the former Defence Secretary did nothing to hint that he could match brother Mahinda for political charisma or public appeal.
With the campaign fizzling out, even party stalwarts were asking the obvious question: where was Basil Rajapaksa The younger Rajapaksa was in fact in the United States and was conspicuous by his absence. Whether that was because he did not endorse the protest or the manner in which it was carried out or whether it was because he had other matters to attend to, is a question that is being asked in JO circles now.
In that sense, Janabalaya Colombata did highlight Namal Rajapaksas inexperience as a political campaigner. Basil Rajapaksa has many faults and his public relations skills are not the best which is why he is not the most popular politician even within the ranks of the JO but no one doubts his ability as a political organiser. If anything, this campaign appears to have demonstrated that without Basil Rajapaksa, the JO would not be a force to reckon with.
Politics is a game where timing is everything. Mahinda Rajapaksa has previously used popular protests such as the Paada Yatra, a march from Kataragama to Colombo, against the government of Ranasinghe Premadasa to good effect. Two years ago, a similar march from Kandy to Colombo was also a reasonable success because it demonstrated the JO had public support and convinced many parliamentarians who were with President Sirisena to switch allegiances.
Janabalaya Colombata
The Janabalaya Colombata however was too little, too soon. It was ill-timed. It did not offer the public any tangible answers except being yet another opposition protest that was full of hype and severely inconvenienced the public, most of whom were allowed to return home early on that day by their employers who feared clashes and disruption of transport services.
With the benefit of hindsight, the JO would have been better off launching Janabalaya Colombata closer to the next presidential election, when its impact would be fresh in the minds of the public. Now, it would be foolhardy to stage another campaign and the JO has lost that opportunity. On the other hand, the government has not only survived the protest, it can also claim that it allowed dissent while maintaining law and order and avoiding serious incidents.
The brains behind the JO must be back to the drawing boards now, asking themselves what went wrong with Janabalaya Colombata. They must be hoping that the advantage they conceded to the government, particularly its United National Party faction, would not be irreversible.

Larson almost turned down  Captain Marvel
Brie Larson is Captain Marvel, and many fans couldnt be more excited after the first look we were given for the film this past week. Sure, a trailer would have been better, but this will do for now.
What many fans dont know, however, is that the actress almost passed on the role entirely. In an interview with EW, the actress said, I never saw myself doing something like this, mostly because I like being anonymous. I like disappearing into characters, and I always felt like if I was out in the public eye too much, it potentially limits you in the future.She added, You have this Kree part of her thats unemotional, that is an amazing fighter and competitive. Then theres this human part of her that is flawed but is also the thing that she ends up leading by. Its the thing that gets her in trouble, but its also the thing that makes her great. And those two sides warring against each other is what makes her - her. The film is the beginning of a long term relationship with Marvel, as Larson praised the company last year. Captain Marvel hits theaters on March 9, 2019.

The lesson from Sweden
Sweden is envied by people from all over the world for its high standard of living, remarkable beauty and relative political stability. However, if Sundays election is an indication, the political climate is changing in Sweden.
Sweden was the very epitome of racial and religious tolerance until recently. But certain far-right politicians have invoked the fear of the other as Sweden opened its borders to an influx of immigrants and refugees that burdened the countrys extensive welfare system to some extent. (Around 18.5 percent of its 2017 population is foreign-born). Experts also say that lengthening queues for critical operations, shortages of doctors and teachers and the failures of police to deal with gang violence have shaken faith in the Swedish model, built on a promise of comprehensive welfare and social inclusion.
This saw support for the nationalist Sweden Democrats surge at the election. This is in line with the trend where far-right parties have made spectacular gains throughout Europe in recent years as anxieties grow over national identity and the effects of globalisation and immigration following armed conflict in the Middle East and North Africa. In Sweden, an influx of 163,000 asylum seekers in 2015 - the most in Europe in relation to the countrys population (10 million) - has divided voters and political parties and fractured political amity.
What is worrying about Swedens election is the rise of the far-right, which campaigned on an anti-immigrant platform inspired by neo-Nazi white supremacist rhetoric. The alt-right Sweden Democrats (SD) won nearly 18 percent of the vote up from 13 percent in the last election four years ago. This is the biggest gain by any party in Swedens Parliament, the Riksdag, in recent memory.
Fortunately, the prediction that the SD would become the largest party had not come true, mainly because many voters in Sweden are still reluctant to fully embrace an unabashed campaign against immigration. SD leader Jimmie Akessons had earlier predicted 20 percent of the vote or more. But this did not stop him from telling a rally that the SD was nevertheless the winner of the election. Thankfully, a poll ranking the issues citizens placed at the top of their agenda saw healthcare, education, gender equality, law and order and elderly care come out on top. Migration and asylum came only eighth.
However, the chilling reality is that extremist politics and politicians are gaining ground in Europe and other parts of the world. There is a strong showing by far-right parties across Europe, with Germanys AfD now the countrys third biggest party and the League in power in Italy. The European Union was set to vote Wednesday on whether to punish Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban for undercutting democracy and breaching common values of the EU, including pushing the passage of anti-immigrant laws.
Moreover, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to US President Donald Trump and one of the most high-profile proponents of far-right politics in the world has been touring Europe touting his ultra-conservative views on immigration, race and other issues. Amidst a debate on what it means to be a Swede or Italian or Hungarian, many people have unfortunately sought refuge in the politics of racism and xenophobia.
These elements abhor the very concepts of freedom that include equal recognition to all communities, open borders and a welcoming atmosphere for refugees. In fact, Swedens SD wants Sweden to leave the EU and freeze immigration. The country already has border controls, though it is still in the EU Schengen Visa scheme. Worse, the SDs rise is likely to embolden Eurosceptic groups ahead of the European Parliament elections in May and thwart efforts at closer EU integration.
Extremist politics is the bane of any nation. As the EU and even the US grapple with extremist politics, this seems to be a familiar story for Sri Lankans, who are used to seeing extremist politicians on all sides trying to sabotage every move aimed at national amity and reconciliation. This is in fact how Sri Lankas internal conflict assumed such monstrous dimensions over the course of 30 years.
These politicians rely on the easiest trick in the political playbook  inflaming racial passions among the populace and demonizing the other communities. Sadly, even after the conflict came to an end, they continue on the same old path in the hope of gaining an electoral advantage. Here in Sri Lanka, they are intent on thwarting every attempt made to forge a truly Sri Lankan identity sans ethnic and religious labeling.
It is time that voters saw through this faade and eschewed their brand of incendiary politics. Such politics of hate can bring nothing but destruction to societies and communities. Ethnic integration can sometimes be challenging, but there is hope for a better future because todays young generation does not think in terms of race or religion. In Sri Lanka, schoolchildren are learning all three languages which will enable them to understand each other perfectly. Legal instruments such as the proposed new Constitution will help, but in the end peace and unity should come from within our hearts.

London Fashion  Week to  feature robots
The wave of sustainability has gripped the UK fashion industry. After the Riccardo Tiscis new Burberry swore to boycott animal fur for the coming seasons, the British Fashion Council has also promised that London Fashion Week for Spring Summer 2019, slated to happen in September, will not show any animal fur as most designers are going fur-free.
This makes London Fashion Week the first of the major fashion events to go fur-free!
Apparel Resources reports, this decision was taken after a recent BFC survey that gave the conclusion that none of the designers are going to use fur in the collections they will showcase next week at the fashion week. Chief Executive of BFC, Caroline Rush says, The move highlights a trend we have seen over the past few years, with more and more brands deciding to use alternative materials to fur.
The council collectively released a statement that said, The BFC survey results reflect a cultural change based on ideals and choices made by designer businesses, international brands as well as consumer sentiment but also encouraged by the stance of multi-brand stores who are moving away from selling fur.
This survey was done as part of Positive Fashion initiative of the BFC, which aims to support the best practices of the industry and encourage change for better, under the pillars of sustainability, equality and diversity, and craftsmanship and community.
This is a pivotal moment in the demise of the cruel fur trade, said Wendy Higgins, the organizations director of communications. It sends out a clarion call of compassion to the other fashion weeks in New York, Paris and Milan to similarly take a bold ethical stance, and it challenges too those designers still using fur to re-examine their morals. Fur cruelty is no longer welcome on the catwalk at London Fashion Week.
The spring summer 2019 edition of LFW will be a beacon for innovation and sustainability as it will also see the debut of robotic models for the very first time on the runways. Honee, the Los Angelesbased designer is collaborating with Silicon Valleys OhmniLabs and Kambria for this cutting edge involvement of robots as models as their label, The House of Honee, will have 22 human models and four robotic counterparts. The event is scheduled for Sept. 15 at the Millennium Gloucester London Hotel.
The London Fashion Week is scheduled from 14th to 18th September, 2018.

"The Ministry of Health with support of this government has done a lot for its citizens of which the public knows nothing about," The Minister said.
Minister Senaratne said that during the previous regime, government officials were quick to put up cut-outs and posters on every street corner for every minute goal.
"We never resorted to poster campaigns or publicity stunts, and today people ask us, what this government has achieved during these three years," he said. "Now is the time for us to publicise, particularly so for the health sector," the Minister added.
Suwa Arana is a tabloid dedicated to health issues, news, interviews and features, issued free with the Sinhala publication Dinamina.

MR indicates intention to contest 2019 Presidential elections in interview
In an exclusive interview with The Hindu, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has indicated his intention to contest the election in 2019 on the SLPP ticket, vowing to fight the restrictions in the 19 th Amendment in courts.
I will lead the SLPP. There is a view that despite the Amendment I can fight elections and then fight it out in courts, he had said. The former President has cited that his fray into politics at the upcoming election would have to be a calculated risk.
But I still have to decide whether to take that risk. Another option is to announce a candidate acceptable to all.
He however ruled out the possibility of his eldest son Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksas chance at the election stating that since the revision of the age limit,Namal cannot be considered for the 2019 elections.
Without indicating a name, the former President however did add that his brother is certainly a contender, but the party and the coalition will have to decide who the people want.
Referring to their win at the local elections in 2018, he said that the party chaired by Prof. G.L Peiris had secured 71 percent of the seats adding that rumours of him representing only Sinhala-Buddhist majoritariansim was a canard spread by his opponents.

Pizza tomatoes to get a boost here
The Agriculture Ministry plans to promote a new high-yield tomato species called San Marzano among local farmers, considering the growing demand for tomatoes which is a result of the arrival of a number of large international fast-food chains in Sri Lanka.
The Agriculture Department has already tested this species in long-term field experiments in the Bandarawela area.
Compared to the tomato variety currently grown in Sri Lanka, San Marzano tomatoes are thinner and more pointed. The flesh is much thicker, with fewer seeds, and the taste is stronger, sweeter and less acidic, Agriculture Department sources said. San Marzano can be cultivated in both wet and dry zones of the country.
San Marzano tomatoes originate from the small town of San Marzano sul Sarno, near Naples, Italy, and this variety is used in pizza toppings.
The Ministry also plans to promote value-added food products with this new tomato variety.

Port of Long Beach Gets USD 50 mn  for Zero Emissions Project
The Port of Long Beach has received preliminary approval for a USD 50 million grant from the California Air Resources Board for a sweeping, transformative demonstration of a near-zero and zero-emissions supply chain at the nations second-busiest seaport.
The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has preliminarily awarded the grant for the Sustainable Terminals Accelerating Regional Transformation (START) Project.
The START Project will demonstrate nearly 100 pieces of zero-emissions terminal equipment and trucks at three California seaports, develop a near-zero emissions tugboat, deploy two of the cleanest ships to ever to call the West Coast, and advance workforce development programs to support sustainable goods movement.
The START Project is part of California Climate Investments, a statewide initiative that puts billions of Cap-and-Trade dollars to work reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening the economy and improving public health and the environment particularly in disadvantaged communities.
Long Beach equipment funded by START includes 33 zero-emissions yard tractors and one top handler at Pier C  one of the nations largest deployments of zero-emissions equipment at a single terminal; five electric trucks at Shippers Transport; two charging outlets at the Clean Trucks Program Center, which will be the first publicly accessible heavy-duty truck charging outlets in Southern California; two Matson container ships with Tier 3 engines, which will be the cleanest container ships to call the West Coast; and Harley Marine electric-drive tugboats.
The prominent role the Port of Long Beach plays in the national economy puts us in the unique position to lead large sustainability efforts such as this that would not be possible elsewhere, said Port of Long Beach Executive Director Mario Cordero.
This will help get us to the green future that we all know is necessary if we want to continue to grow our business, and its the right thing to do for our communities.
The project will be completed by June 2021 and includes USD 52 million in matching funds from private and public partners for a total cost of USD 102 million.

Public - private partnerships, the way forward - PM
The Southeast Asian Region is engaged in a common dialogue to obtain the contribution of the private sector for future development projects, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Premier said since public investment is not enough, measures are being taken in Sri Lanka to introduce laws and regulations to encourage the public sector to enter into public - private partnerships.
The Premier made this observation during a pre-session of the World Economic Forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) under the theme Mobilising Private Capital in ASEAN, at the National Convention Centre in Hanoi, Vietnam.
Premier Wickremesinghe also said that measures are being taken in Sri Lanka to introduce laws and regulations to encourage the public sector to enter into public - private partnerships.
President and Member of the Managing Board of the World Economic Forum on ASEAN, Borge Brende, commencing the session, said the public sector in Asian region countries alone cannot fund development projects in the region in accordance with the predictions made on the regions development within the next 15 years. Due to this reason, strategies should be formulated without delay to use private sector funds for development programmes.
During the round of discussions, panelists explained how they utilised private sector funds for development projects in their own countries and the challenges faced by them in the endeavour.
The panelists were Indonesias Maritime Affairs Minister Luhut B. Pandjaitan, Asia Development Banks East Asia, South-east Asia and the Pacific Vice President Stephen P. Groff, International Finance Corporations Asia and Pacific Regional Vice-President Nena Stoiljkovic, Vina Capital Group Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Don Lam and Credit Suisse Asia-Pacific Vice Chairman Jose Isidro Camacho.

ROBOTS RULE!
Technology is ushering in a new age of automation. Every day, across industries, smarter machines are deployed to manage the growing scale of work. With computer technology eliminating some tasks and lowering the demand for human labour, man has been able to perform tasks better and at a more rapid rate by sharing the labour with machines. 
 These youth are taking robots and artificial intelligence to the next level. Making impressive strides in the innovative sector, the young guys and girls worked together as a team to develop machines as a means of finding solutions to some global issues. The event, titled First Global Challenge (FGC) 2018 saw over 150 teams from all parts of the world gathering together under one roof at the Arena Ciudad de Mexico in Mexico City, Mexico, to take part in the annual international robotics competition. Considered as the robotics Olympics and held from August 15 to 18, FGC focuses on fostering, understanding and cooperation among youth as they use their skills to resolve problems which have emerged in the modern society.
This years competition was themed Energy Impact. Teams competed to fuel power plants, initiate renewable energy plants and build a resilient transmission network. The Sri Lankan team comprised of eight youth: Lasith Kodagoda and Navod Vitharanage from Presidents College, Embilipitiya, Sherwin Leonard from St Johns College, Jaffna, and Dao Thanh Cong, Felix Deemer, Daniel Joung, Hamza Anver and Syanthan Selvakumaran from Elizabeth Moir School, Colombo.
The robot designed by the team
The team designed a robot which is able to perform simple tasks like picking up boxes, storing them, transporting them to a specific location and lifting them up to a specific height. It was also designed to carry solar panels and to drop them off.
What was special about our robot was our lift mechanism. 193 countries took part in the event and they used only four types of mechanisms to lift boxes. Ours was one of a kind of product. All the other country did not use this kind of mechanism. So our product stood out among them because of this, Daniel explained.
The team has worked tirelessly for four months developing the machine. They have been guided by the teachers in charge Satchithananthan, Rathnasinghe, Fernando and Aruliah.
Speaking about how the students were chosen to take part in the event the team manager and teacher in charge of Team Sri Lanka, Srimali Fernando said, Sherwin from St Johns in Jaffna approached us independently and asked to join the team. Of course, we were delighted to have him on board! The boys from Embilipitiya  Navod and Lasith, were nominated by their Robotics teacher after we approached the school about joining Team Sri Lanka for FGC 2018. The students from Elizabeth Moir School were selected based on their talent and interest as well as their ability to give the competition the time and effort needed.
She added that being able to secure the necessary funds is an important aspect. If participants are unable to finance themselves, then funding needs to be found for them.
We were lucky to have generous sponsors who were willing to step in and provide the additional support needed to send the team to Mexico this year, she said.
Felix echoes the words of Dean Kamen, inventor and founder of the First Global Challenge when he says that robotics is all about problem solving, about solving the real, concrete challenges that the world faces today, whether its global warming or producing enough energy.
Kamen talked about the effort people put into sport, and how he is trying to turn robotics into a sport so that more people will be interested in it, and there will be a whole generation of people who are really good at robotics, really good at coding and really good at solving problems. Anyone in any country should have the opportunity to do robotics and coding because it is so interesting and useful, he opined.
Navod too has always been interested in robotics from childhood. He believes that every student should be given the opportunity to study it.
Sherwin said that he has a lot of interests from technology and science to music and sports.
However robotics is my most important passion. I want to be a Mechatronics Engineer. I won second place for my invention at the SLAAS competition. My goal is to help future generations learn more about robotics and achieve more in that field, particularly in terms of Artificial Intelligence, he expressed.
Speaking about his experience working with the other team members Navod said that working with students from an international school has been a refreshing experience for him
It was a great opportunity to improve my abilities in robotics. My parents and friends too backed me and were very proud of our achievement, he added.
The language barrier has been a minor problem for the team during the first few days the team began work. Syanthan says that it turned out to be beneficial as the team members came up with different ideas and solutions because they came from diverse backgrounds and cultures.
The team says that the highlight of the whole event was the game in which they scored one of the highest points ever to be scored in the tournament.
It was a really fantastic experience! We were partnered with Jamaica and South Africa and the synergy between us really helped win us that game, Syanthan enthused.
Daniel adds that he and the South African captain strategized for a long time before the game.
That really helped. Another highlight was winning a judges award, on the technical side, for our robots unique design and efficiency, he explained.
Sherwin adds that he managed to make friends with a lot of other participants from various nations.
This was my first time at an international competition and I really enjoyed the experience, he said.
Daniel says that every robot which had been exhibited at FGC 2018 was unique in its own way.
It was interesting to see so many different solutions for the same problem, he noted.
With their certificates
Representing Sri Lanka in Mexico
I would definitely encourage other students to take part in FGC. It was such an amazing experience not only because of learning more about robotics but also because you get to meet people from all these different countries, get to see their ideas and talk with them. For anyone with potential in this area, take any action. You can to pursue your interest. Take whatever opportunities you may get to participate in robotics and coding related events and competitions, Felix advised.
Being part of team Sri Lanka gave me a chance to contribute to something that showcased our country and our abilities. Everyone else with potential in robotics and coding should try to find and take opportunities like this one, was Navods message to other youth.

The State Minister said the Disaster Management Ministry had requested another Rs.20 million for the purpose.
State Minister Range Bandara was speaking at a press briefing at the Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management Ministry, on Tuesday.
Referring to a certain political column in a Sunday newspaper that accused the ministry and the government for not taking relief measures for people affected by the long-prevailing drought, State Minister Range Bandara said the government had spent Rs.58.3 million to provide relief for the affected.
The State Minister added that 17 districts were affected by the prolonged drought.
He said 890,001 people from 248,519 families were affected.
The State Minister added that drinking water was provided continuously for 89 Divisional Secretariats and the government distributed 10,512 water canisters among the affected. According to the State Minister, an additional 200 water canisters will also be purchased.
We provide a monthly allocation of Rs. 5,000 for every farmer whose crops were destroyed due to the drought. We are also distributing dry rations among 200,000 affected families.
Considering the situation, the government will facilitate and help people dig cultivation wells, tube wells and temporary cultivation wells in tanks in the Anuradhapura district, which is the worst-affected area so far, he said.
The State Minister added that Myanmar granted 300 Metric Tonnes of rice to be distributed among the drought-affected.
When asked about the recent fuel price hike, the State Minister said the fuel price after two hikes is still less than what was prior to 2015 under the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. He said it is necessary to keep the prices on par with the world market price fluctuations.
This fuel price formula is not just for increasing prices. It operates both ways. When a decrease comes, the formula will apply. However, eventually, the fuel prices will go down, he said.

Running the world
Sri Lankan marathoner, Hassan Esufally who is on a mission to earn the Seven Continents Marathon Club Membership recently ran his first-ever marathon in South America - a gruelling 42km trail across the southern Peruvian Andes. On his challenging journey towards becoming a 7 Continents Marathon Club Member, Hassan has now completed marathons in Europe, Asia, Australia, Africa and South America. Running the Inca Trail Marathon in Peru he becomes the first Sri Lankan to have conquered international marathons in five continents.
We started the race in total darkness, way before the crack of dawn, with only our headlamps to light the way. This was quite challenging for me given that Id never run with a headlamp before, but I knew that this was only a foretaste of how much Id have to push myself beyond my comfort zone during this marathon. In addition to making our way in the rugged and craggy terrain, we were faced with the most extreme and varying weather conditions, ranging from harsh winds and snow to heavy rains and sunshine, he shared his experience.
The entire first half of the marathon was full of varying degrees of uphill and downhill slopes, so I adapted a strategy of walking through the uphill areas and sprinting through the downhill areas as I am a much better downhill runner than an uphill runner, he added.
Esufally said one of the most predictable challenges of this marathon was the extremely low air pressure which made breathing very difficult. However, having trained intensely for many months with my high-altitude mask on, I was well-acclimated to withstand the acutely thin air atop the Andes. Moreover, by the halfway point of the marathon, I had twisted my ankles for a grand total of ten times, five times on each leg. By this time, my legs and entire body were so sore, but in spite of it all, I summoned up all the strength and stamina in me to race against time and make the cut-off for the WinayWayna Gate, he explained.
He pointed out that it was really encouraging to see how the hikers and holidaymakers on the Inca Trail were very respectful and thoughtful towards the marathon runners, always giving preference on the course.
My most memorable moments and experiences from the Inca Trail Marathon, Id have to say, were when I first entered through the Sun Gate and set eyes on the mighty Machu Picchu fortress - it was profoundly relieving and rewarding to be standing up there, soaking up the beauty and glory of this lost ancient city, he said.
On a personal level, the Inca Trail Marathon was more than just a race - it was a one-of-a-kind, life-changing experience. I count myself extremely lucky and blessed to have had the chance to see first-hand and run atop this magnificent citadel. Running past the finish line of what is considered to be the worlds toughest marathon, with the Sri Lankan flag hoisted high above my shoulders is a moment that will forever stay ingrained in my heart and mind. The average person would take three nights and four days to complete a marathon of this nature. To have finished it in just 12.75 hours gave me a profound boost of confidence, and it made me realize that I have truly grown and improved as a professional marathon runner, Esufally revealed.

Russian World Cup hero  Cheryshev in doping probe
Madrid, Wednesday: Spains anti-doping agency said Wednesday it has opened an investigation into Valencias Russian striker Denis Cheryshev, one of the revelations of the 2018 World Cup.
The announcement comes after a Russian publication quoted the players father, Dmitri, as saying in June 2017 that Cheryshev had received growth hormone injections when he played at Spanish side Villarreal.
Dmitri Cheryshev has since said his statements have been twisted by reporters, while the player himself insists his conscience is clear. Without a medical exemption, the use of growth hormones is considered doping and is punishable with a ban of up to four years.
An investigation has been opened to get more information regarding this case, a spokesman for Spains anti-doping agency AEPSAD told AFP.
The investigation is being carried out in cooperation with Russias anti-doping agency and in permanent contact with the World Anti-Doping Agency which is aware of the affair and will be informed of the conclusions, the spokesman said, adding it was too soon to draw conclusions.
Cheryshev, who scored four goals in five World Cup games for Russia as they reached the quarter finals, had denied any wrongdoing. AFP

Sand mining: decision on vulnerable areas soon
The Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management Ministry will take a decision on areas that are vulnerable to sand mining near rivers by December this year, Ministry Secretary Eng. N. A. Sisira Kumara said.
Kumara said the ministry is conducting an investigation to identify locations where sand mining is taking place near rivers.
The Ministry Secretary was addressing a press briefing at the Irrigation and Water Resources and Disaster Management Ministry premises on Tuesday.
He was speaking with reference to the recent saltwater intrusion into Kalu Ganga that occurred due to dry weather.
There are certain locations at rivers where excessive sand mining takes place, which results in adverse environmental effects. By December this year, we will decide on the areas in rivers where sand mining should or should not take place. Then, we will ban sand mining in identified river areas, the Ministry Secretary said. Kumara said the Irrigation Department is conducting a study to set up a blocking structure to prevent saltwater intrusion into Kalu Ganga. Saltwater intrusion covers a 17 km spread in Kalu Ganga at present.
However, it is no easy task. It is a decision that should be taken after considering a number of sensitive issues and technicalities regarding the condition. For example, the area near Kalu Ganga is exposed to heavy flooding. The blocking structure may cause floods later. Therefore, we cannot rush into things. We need to take a carefully calculated decision, he said. Kumara added that excessive sand mining in rivers causes saltwater intrusion, which is the case in Kalu Ganga.

Two thirds out of them; about 1,300-1,800, will need surgery or intervention for their heart lesions to be corrected, and with proper treatment, 85-90 per cent of them will reach adulthood.
The Rotary Club of Colombo West (RCCW) is committed towards assisting under privileged children with congenital heart defects undergo lifesaving treatment.The RCCW has made plans in collaboration with the Rotary Club of Sai City and Asiri Group of Hospitals to accomplish 35 heart surgeries on children during 2018/2019. Two such surgeries have already been successfully performed in Coimbatore (India). With this initiative, the Club will be able to give hope for children with CHD by enabling them to undergo heart surgery before they reach adulthood.

Shanghai Museum, CCF ink study pact
The Shanghai Museum has signed a MOU with the Central Cultural Fund (CCF) on a five-year archaeological cooperation programme. Yang Zhigang, the curator of Shanghai Museum, said the MOU was a comprehensive cultural exchange programme ranging from joint excavation, relic protection and museum exhibition to educational cooperation, Xinhua reported.
The MOU was signed after the museum's archaeological team went to Sri Lanka to join a 40-day site excavation at the ruins of Allaippidy in Jaffna in August.
The archaeologists found some porcelain fragments dating back to the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1127), which were transported from China. Sri Lanka is an important stop on the Maritime Silk Road. Chinese explorer Zhang He visited Sri Lanka in 1405 for the first time," Yang said, explaining why the museum made Sri Lanka the first station in its overseas joint archaeological research on the Maritime Silk Road.
He said Zhang was the key figure for Shanghai Museum's overseas archaeological excavation. A stone tablet exhibited in the National Museum of Sri Lanka was proved to be left by Zhang. Archaeologists from the museum hoped to find more evidence of Zhang's fleet to Sri Lanka.
Yang said that the joint excavation in Jaffna will focus on the trade route of the Maritime Silk Road. "The two sides will hold joint exhibitions on archaeological findings and publish research papers in both Chinese and English," said the curator.

Shanghai:  where anything and everything  is possible
Shanghai is the largest city in China by population and global financial hub has scored great achievements since China implemented the reform and opening-up policy 40 years ago. It is believed that Shanghai's experience in the past 40 years will provide benefits for Sri Lankan people to fulfill their considerable development. Celebrating the 15th anniversary of establishing Colombo-Shanghai sister city relationship a Photo Exhibition on Shanghai's Achievements in 40 Years of Reform and Opening up and Window of Shanghai Book Donation was held recentlyat Colombo Public Library.
Chinese Ambassador, Cheng Xueyuan
This event was held during the visit of the delegation headed by the Director of Shanghai Municipal People's Congress of China, Yin Yicui. Chinese Ambassador, Cheng Xueyuan, of Development Strategies and International Trade Minister, Malik Samarawickrema, Colombo Mayor, Rosy Senanayake attended the ceremony as Chief Guests.
Chinese Ambassador, Cheng Xueyuan said Chinas reform and opening-up policy offers the wisdom and power to move forward. In the Chinese culture, there is a belief that people at the age of 40 could tell right from wrong without any puzzle. As for the 40 years great journey of Chinas reform and opening-up, it solves the puzzle of how to lift a nation with one billion population from the state of poverty and blankness to prosperity and strength. For the past four decades, under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, our nation has remained independent, relied on its own efforts, upheld the principles of openness, inclusiveness and win-win cooperation, and accomplished remarkable achievements, Ambassador said.
Colombo Mayor, Rosy Senanayake
Chinas GDP has increased from 360 billion Yuan to 82.7 trillion Yuan, growing at an annual average rate of 9.5 per cent; around 700 million Chinese people have been lifted out of poverty, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the global total over the same period. Today, China has become the worlds second largest economy, largest industrial country and largest trader of goods with the largest foreign exchange reserves.
We have successfully opened up a socialist development path with Chinese characteristics and have gained confidence in our path, guiding theories, political system and culture. Shanghai is the model and pioneer of China reform and opening-up, and its brilliant achievements are the epitome of the tremendous achievements of Chinas reform and opening-up. As the economic and financial center of their respective country and sister city of each other, Shanghai and Colombo have lots to learn from each other in metropolitan development and governance, Ambassador Xueyuan added.
Located at the crossroad of the Indian Ocean, he said, Sri Lanka has acted as a regional trade center since ancient times, and just like China, Sri Lanka has benefited a lot from WTO and global trade rules.
No other country could better understand the importance of upholding the free trade system than Sri Lanka. Trade liberalization and economic globalization would build Sri Lanka as a gem on the Indian Ocean; on the contrary, without them, Sri Lanka may only become a lonely island on the vast Indian Ocean. Devoted to upholding the global trade system based on international rules, China acts as a strong force in advocating economic globalization and trade liberalization and takes a firm position against protectionism and unilateralism, Ambassador explained.

He said in November this year, China will hold the first China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai. This is a major policy measure of China to further open its market to the world. CIIE will provide new opportunities for export, build new platforms for countries to share the dividends of Chinas development and inject new vitality to world economic growth. China welcomes Sri Lankan friends from all walks of life, including friends from Colombo, to attend this Expo, and promote Sri Lankas black tea, rubber, gems, textiles, spices and other featured products to the 1.3 billion Chinese people, bringing more fruitful results to the friendly relations and cooperation between China and Sri Lanka, Ambassador concluded.
China has become our second neighbour, said the Mayor of Colombo, Rosy Senanayake speaking at an event. Senanayake said the relations between Sri Lanka and China have strengthened, our friendship between the two countries goes beyond fifteen years. Weve had very good friendship and bilateral relations between the two countries.
It has also been a great pleasure to have had this conversation this afternoon, with regards to strengthening the ties between the two sister-cities, said Mayor Senanayake, The fact that you reached out to support us in the area of IT and technology is commendable. We have much to learn, share our experiences, and work together, so that we strengthen the bilateral relationships and friendships that we have had in the past.
Chairperson of the Standing Committee of Shanghai Municipal Peoples Congress, Yin Yicui discussed the rapid achievements of Shanghai and China as a whole. One representative of the Shanghai municipality added, I hope that these pictures will bring you the charm of Shanghai, and give you a deeper impression of our beautiful city.

SPORTS LETTER: A compliment to Virat Kohli
As one who was engrossed in the current England/India cricket series it may be interesting to mention about Virat Kohli the Indian captain, the worlds best batsmen at present who shows an arrogant look on the field and the celebration he does when a wicket falls running from one end of the field to the other. The emotion and the pressure he expresses is as if he has won the World Cup, something not done by other captains.
Seeing him on TV acting like this makes most cricket fans here dislike him and the team.
At the end of the day however at the post match presentation after the 4th test although India lost the match after a thrilling day and also thereby lost the series 3-1 he showed what a great sportsman he is when he gave full credit to the English team and said they were truly outplayed by a better team in spite of their close defeats.
His speech was eloquent, flawless and so audible that it even outdid the English captain Joe Root who was interviewed after that. There were no ifs and buts in his speech as done generally by losing captains.
His close friend, the former South African captain AB de Villiers has also said about his fighting and arrogant looks on the field but off the field he is just a simple down to earth friendly guy possibly mistaken by many on account of his attitude on the field.
Well done VK hope this may change the mind set of many.

Sri Lanka not falling into a debt trap - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe shot back at economists who called out that the country was among Asias most vulnerable to global emerging market volatility.
Sri Lanka is building long term financial stability by diversifying its exports beyond tea and apparel and into higher-value goods and services, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told CNBC on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on ASEAN in Hanoi, Vietnam on Tuesday.
Wickremesinghe denied the oft-cited claim that Sri Lanka was ceding control of strategically vital ports to Chinese control and said he didnt believe the country was falling into a debt trap caused by high-interest Chinese loans.
We are dealing with China. There is a fair amount of Chinese investment. There are China loansI cant see it as a threat.
Sri Lanka and China have agreed to a 99-year lease of the southern Hambantota port, which underlines Chinas growing strategic and commercial influence in the Indian Ocean region.
We dont foresee any issues by looking at this from an economic project, as an economic investment, Wickremesinghe said. Sri Lanka has been unaligned and have stayed that way since 1948.
Sri Lankas opposition, led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, is capitalising on economic hardships, mobilizing supporters to pressure the government into holding early polls. Wickremesinghe, however, said he cant see an early election.
He claimed his government inherited debt racked up through the mismanagement of the prior administration. We took over the government and stabilised the economy ... they ran away, we were the only ones left.
Despite concerns voiced earlier this month by ratings agency Fitch about a challenging external debt servicing outlook, high government debt and political uncertainty following regional polls, Wickremesinghe said he didnt believe Sri Lankan sovereign bonds were on the verge of a downgrade.
We and many others are running deficits in Asia and that certainly would be a matter of concern, but so far we have been able to negotiate with rating agencies and it has certainly not affected our borrowing capacity, he said.
Sri Lankas government debt remains high at around 77 percent of GDP.
Japanese bank Nomura Holdings on Monday identified Sri Lanka as one of 30 emerging markets most susceptible to an exchange rate crisis, a claim vehemently denied by Sri Lankas central bank and Wickremesinghe, who called it false.
Both took particular exceptions at Nomuras initial short-term external debt estimate of $160 billion, a figure Nomura later admitted was inaccurate. The bank issued a corrected number of $7.5 billion as of the first quarter. When asked about the official figure, Wickremesinghe put it at $14.2 billion, though the time period was unclear. The higher number could also be due to officials using a broader measure of external debt.
Sri Lanka, bailed out by the International Monetary Fund in 2009 and mid-2016, should not need further support from the global lender, the prime minister said.
We have been going to the IMF a bit too often ... Sri Lanka and Pakistan, and I hope that we will be able to manage, he said. (The) IMF saved us at a crucial period, I must acknowledge it, but we must learn now to go on our own. (CNBC)

March 12 Movement tells Peoples representatives:
Work to fulfil peoples aspirations
The March 12 Movement yesterday, urged the Peoples representatives to work effectively in order to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
Although there is at least one peoples representative for every 2,170 citizens in the country, it doubtful whether they serve the public in a meaningful way, PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
There are 9,215 peoples representatives in the country including 225 Members of Parliament, 455 Provincial Councillors and 8,535 members of Local Government bodies to deliver the demands of the citizens. Massive funds amounting to millions of rupees are incurred monthly in terms of salaries, allowances, vehicles, fuel, telephones, office staff and security in maintaining them. But, it is doubtful whether the majority of peoples representatives do fulfill their responsibilities on behalf of the people.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Hettiarachchi said it is regrettable that Parliament which meets only eight days per month had to be adjourned on most days due to the lack of quorum. The postponement of Parliament due to the lack of quorum of 20 members was reported several times in the recent past. It was a huge waste of public money as the cost for Parliamentary meetings would amount approximately to Rs.4.5 million per day.
We insist that it is the responsibility of the Leader of the House and the leaders of all political parties to take measures to prevent this situation. The March 12 Movement firmly requests from all Members of Parliament to fulfill their duty to the people of this country whom they represent with a high sense of responsibility and accountability, the PAFFREL Executive Director said.
Hettiarachchi said the careless manner in which the peoples representatives tend to spend public funds for their comfort became evident in the recent attempt of the Western Provincial Council to buy super luxury chairs at an exorbitant price of Rs.650,000 per chair for the Council.The poor families are granted only Rs.Rs.500,000 by this government to build a house for them under the state housing programme. So, how could anyone with a proper sense of justice justify the spending of Rs.650,000 for a chair for a council.
On the other hand, how many of the peoples representatives are in prisons at present due to engaging in anti social activities and misuse of power and public funds,he said.
Hettiarachchi said that all peoples representatives should work together to fulfill the peoples aspirations.
