Can Sri Lanka make use of home advantage
Sri Lankan Tuskers are ready to make the maximum use of home advantage that has not always worked in their favour in the final round of the Asia Rugby Sevens Series that gets underway at the Race course International Stadium, Reid Avenue today.
A pathetic run in to two consecutive plate championships in the first two legs in Hong Kong and South Korea to be placed in an awful fifth place in the standings has made the side low in confidence and that they will be out to make amends with a much better display today. Sri Lanka has gone down miserably since last year being relegated from second place to fifth this year.
There is plenty for Sri Lanka sevens rugby outfit that went through intense training for the past two weeks at Race course International rugby stadium in Colombo, with the winner of the three-round Asian Sevens series booking a spot in the main draw of next years Singapore Sevens tournament and Hong Kong Sevens.
Sudarshana Muthuthanthri (Captain)
They are bound to give off their best but for the Sri Lankan Tuskers to qualify for these two tournaments are out of their reach even if they win the final hurdle in the third leg in Colombo.
Furthermore, the two top teams in the overall standings will secure their place in the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series qualifier in Hong Kong next year and a good start to the series this weekend is a key factor.
Chairman of selectors Michael Jayasekara speaking exclusively to the Daily News said, We have got a well-balanced young side with a blend of youth, experience and natural talent, hence I personally believe that we can definitely look at finishing among the top three in Colombo, concluded Jayasekara.
What really happened this time around in the two legs is that Sri Lanka sort of had a bit of a look at their game through lot of young players coming in to the side, and although they hadnt done much wrong they still finished overall fifth in Asia, Sri Lanka had to get a better team on the day to play the match physically and mentally.
Head trainer Nick Groube, who was a vastly experienced and well respected trainer in New Zealand, came in and put it right last year where Sri Lanka managed to learn some lessons and put them in to play to finish overall second in Asia just behind winners Hong Kong. It is a lot about the training and hard work they do purely under Groube to condition the players mentally and physically to be able to handle pressure. Sometimes the players totally get it a bit wrong like we did in the first two legs in Hong Kong and South Korea this time , but its about how you respond and Groube is definitely the man to take Sri Lankan rugby forward internationally with his international exposure.
A win or a top-two finish in Colombo will probably see Sri Lanka in the box seat to secure at least the overall third place this weekend, but playing in home soil will be tough competition, therefore we have to wait and see whether their power pack display they use to carry out in the past will be enough for them to seal an unpredictable victory in the end.
Sri Lanka will be drawn in pool A along with South Korea, China and Chinese Taipei , while the pool B will comprise 2nd leg runner-up Japan along with Hong Kong, Malaysia and Philippines.
Tuskers will play their pool matches against 2nd leg winners South Korea at 11:14am followed by China at 2:32pm and their final pool match will be against eighth placed Chinese Taipei at 5:28pm.

The 12 member squad is as follows: Sudarshana Muthuthanthri (Captain/Forward), Jason Dissanayake (Forward), Kavindu Perera (Three Quarter), Rehan Silva (Three Quarter) Richard Dharmapala (Three Quarter), Tarinda Ratwatte (Utility Player), Srinath Sooriyabandara (Utility Player), Danushka Ranjan (Three quarter) Omalka Gunaratne (Forward), Danush Dayan (Utility Player), Sudam Sooriarachchi (Utility Player), Reeza Rafaideen (Three Quarter), Head coach-PeterWoods Trainer-Nick Groub

China urges US to preserve Iran nuclear deal
CHINA: China on Friday called on the United States to maintain its commitment to the Iranian nuclear deal, which President Donald Trump is expected to declare no longer in America's interest.
We believe this deal is important to ensuring the international nuclear nonproliferation regime and regional peace and stability. We hope all parties can continue to preserve and implement this deal, foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said during a regular press briefing.
China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, discussed the Iranian nuclear issue with US counterpart Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Thursday to prepare for Trump's November visit to Beijing, Hua said.
The agreement was signed between Iran and six world powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the US -- at talks coordinated by the European Union.
While the deal stalled Iran's nuclear programme and thawed relations between Tehran and its Great Satan, opponents say it also prevented efforts to challenge Iranian influence in the Middle East.
US officials say Trump will not kill the international accord outright, instead decertifying the agreement and leaving US lawmakers to decide its fate.
UN nuclear inspectors say Iran is meeting the technical requirements of its side of the bargain, dramatically curtailing its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani lashed out at his US counterpart saying he was opposing the whole world by trying to abandon the agreement.

Coconuts for Rs. 65
The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) and Lanka Sathosa have jointly taken measures to provide coconuts at Rs 65. Accordingly, the consumers will be able to purchase five coconuts at Rs.65 each at Sathosa outlets.
Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairman Kapila Yakandawala said the CCB has already issued one million coconuts to the market. Measures would be taken to supply four million coconuts to the market by next month.
Then we would be able to completely normalize the price of coconuts.
Around 70,000 coconuts have been supplied to 180 urban Sathosa outlets and we also informed Kapruka societies to supply coconuts directly to Sathosa outlets. He said the programme to provide coconuts to the public at a concessionary price was launched by the CCB with the intention of controlling unusual price hike.
As a result of this we would be able to control the unnecessary profits earned by traders.

CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS
Ex Chief Justice Sarath N de Silva is most certainly learned and some kind of intellectual but without an ideology or ethics. During Mahinda regime he was loyal to Mahinda and as himself explained, he twisted the law according to the needs of the fascistic leader. Then he supported the struggle of the democracy while pleading mercy from the people.
Now he supports the Joint Opposition in their political activities. On some issues he is fighting on legal basis. He expects Mahinda group to give political leadership to these activities. Still, he wont contest elections or hold any office. He has come in the interest of the public. People can change and consistency may be a hindrance to creative human intervention.
Let us look into his thinking. In a republic people are most important and their franchise leads the state. However franchise has to express through organised elections. There is no other accepted way. However in that application franchise can get spoiled as in the case of elections Lanka, in the recent past.
Though proportional representation is just, the selection of candidates by preference vote spoiled the resultant political representation. In fact political views became secondary and commercial and communal interest became dominant. Hence Yahapalanaya had to struggle to replace the method of election. Yes, it became time consuming. However democracy depends on the method of election and that means postponing elections while the debate is going on method of elections.
Local Government elections
It is true that Lanka has four dimensional democracy and in the new constitution proposed it may reduce it to three dimensions if presidency is removed from being elected. There was a delay in holding Local Government elections due to complex issues involved in changing election system. But it is wrong to say one level of Government, provided for in the Constitution, has ceased to function. People have lost their democratic rights. there cannot be elections until people agree on the election system.
It is true that the next level of Government is provincial councils. The Article 155 (e) of the Constitution states that every Provincial Council elected holds office for a period of five years from the first meeting. Three provincial councils are out of office. These elections must be conducted.
The Provincial Councils Election Act states that the Election Commission, within one week, shall publish a notice informing that the elections will be held. These are very clear-cut laws. It has worked for 30 years. All that is correct but people wanted to change the election system. Hence the Government used some practical action within the parliament to overcome this problem. He has challenged that in the Supreme Court. It is interesting to watch the outcome!
The government while proposing the report of the steering committee on constitutional reform expected debate to open in parliament at the end of October. However the debate already started in streets and news papers. As a member of the Steering Committee spearheading the constitutional reform project, Jayampathi expects that the Constitutional assembly would take up proposals over a three-day period beginning October 30. However he admitted the finalization of the process would depend on the outcome of three day talks.
In the meantime PM Wickremesinghe wants people to believe that measures proposed to further strengthen the unitary character of the country will work. He emphasized that the proposals were also meant to ensure maximum possible devolution without undermining the unitary status of the constitution. Since its appointment by the Constitutional assembly in April 2016 the steering committee has met on 73 occasions. That shows the eagerness of all parties to understand the Constitutional process. The public debate is arrested by the seriousness of the debate within the Constitutional assembly. It is true that the large number of meetings that have taken place is a positive expression of the commitment of the political parties to the Constitutional reform process.
Mahinda group
All parties in parliament with the exception of the ultra Sinhala nationalist National Freedom Front have chosen to remain within the process. Latter expected Mahinda group to follow them, thus Weerawansa becoming the militant leader of the fascistic group. That failed and the participants have included members of the Joint Opposition who have been the racist opposition to the government but continue to attend the steering committee meetings.
This has created hopes among minority nationalities as expressed by political leaders such as TNA and Opposition Leader R Sambanthan. He has said with much hopes, that in the past No Constitution has thus far been framed for Sri Lanka on the basis of a substantial bipartisan consensus amongst its different people in particular the Tamil people, or on the basis of such bi-partisan consensus between the two main parties and other political parties. The present exercise in Constitution making presents the first such opportunity. The Constitutional reform process remains grounded in the consciousness of the people as necessary for the country though racists on all sides are creating confusions. There is also a lack of awareness about the dangers created by some of the key and emotive issues in the Constitutional reform process. These include the unnecessary confusion created about the meaning of the unitary state and the foremost place given to Buddhism under the present Constitution.
The steering committee has tried to explain that the classical definition of the English term unitary state has undergone change. In the United Kingdom it is now possible for Northern Ireland and Scotland to move away from the union.
Therefore, the English term Unitary State will not be appropriate for Sri Lanka. This argument is confusing as the term United Kingdom is not very different from United States. However, it is proposed that the Sinhala term aekiya raajyaya best describes an undivided and indivisible country. The Tamil language equivalent of this is orumiththa nadu.
India is considered a unitary state though the powers of states are much more than in Lanka. So it is possible to follow Indian example to satisfy everybody. Instead of following practical example of Indian Constitutional pandiths are struggling with western models.
The issue of whether Lanka should remain unitary in its Constitutional structure has traditionally been the line of division between the Sinhala and Tamil polities. Hence the key question has been whether Sri Lanka should be a country where a single government dominates, or move towards a federal system in which central and devolved governments can coexist at different levels. However nobody wants to follow the thinking of Ambedkar and Periyar. Trouble is that law makers are looking towards western example without giving attention to Asiatic wisdom.

Cyber Security HQ at SLAF
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) will establish their Cyber Security Headquarters at the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF), according to a MoD official.
This unit will have representations from the tri-forces and the police force, and will work towards improving cyber security capabilities and intelligence for national security purposes.
The MoD official said SLAF Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy, had initially volunteered to set up a cyber security system for the Army. It was later expanded to all forces.
The official said so as he answered questions on how prepared the forces were to deal with cyber security threats at the Colombo Air Symposium on Thursday (12).
At present, the Air Force, which deals with the most advanced technologies of the tri-forces, has the most comprehensive cyber security system. Thus, it was natural that the SLAF would take a leading role in setting up the system for all security forces.
National Institute of Security Studies, Researcher, Priyanka Moonasinghe who presented on The Role of Cyber Espionage as an Asymmetric Threat through Air Power at the Air Symposium, speaking on the SLAF cyber security system, said the Information and Technology Unit of the SLAF had direct domain control and is monitoring over 4,000 computers with internal and external networks.
They operate from 25 bases centrally connected to one administrative controller.
In an effort to minimize threats from the cyber domain, the staff is not allowed to install hardware or software or use external storage devices, with the exception of a few designated computers.
"This safeguards them against threats such as Red October, said Moonasinghe.
Red October was a cyber-attack launched on many government agencies around the world, mainly in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and former Soviet nations to steal sensitive security information.
The SLAF system, which has many networks, also has many layers of defence and is multipronged, making it harder for hackers, she said.
The SLAF also has a Cyber Command Operations Centre which is the cyber security and monitoring section that gathers intelligence on a 24-hour basis to inspect threats from the cyber domain.
The Operations Centre conducts cyber threats on its own system to identify its loopholes and fix them.

Freddie Flintoff reveals personal Ben Stokes anguish
Doesn't know how to explain situation to his kids
Freddie Flintoff has suffered his own anguish over Ben Stokes' street brawl  because he didn't know how to explain it to his kids.
Stokes is likely to miss the whole Ashes tour of Australia unless he is cleared by Avon and Somerset police over his part in a fight outside a Bristol nightclub last month.
The England all-rounder has already been told he will not be on the plane with Joe Root's squad on October 28 while he waits to find out if he will face criminal charges.
And former captain Flintoff, who was Stokes' predecessor as England's box office colossus, has agonised over telling his young sons why the middle-order hero they idolise has been suspended by Lord's.
Flintoff, famously stripped of the England vice-captaincy and dropped after late-night misadventure on a pedalo during the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean, said: I just hope it's not the end of him.
We've got to give him a chance to redeem himself. He will be desperate to do that and I hope we give him that opportunity.
I'm a massive Ben Stokes fan, and the hardest part for me has been explaining it to my kids because they idolise him.
Flintoff, who will be 40 in December, says Stokes should not have been outside a nightclub at 2.30am without the England management's knowledge or a security escort.
On his BBC Radio podcast Flintoff, Savage and the Ping Pong Guy, he said: Surely it's a case of innocent until proven guilty, but the line is pretty simple  there are laws of the land.
As a sportsman and someone in the public eye, especially when you are a bit young, maybe you think they don't apply to you as much.
I can understand [England director of cricket] Andrew Strauss and the ECB can't just let it slide.
But I don't understand how he [Stokes] is in this position at 2.30am with Alex Hales.
Ben has had a lot of time to think about it. When things are going well, everyone wants to be your mate  all of a sudden he's in a bit of a pickle and he needs looking after.
I was always no good at asking for help: It always got to a point where I needed intervention, and I think Ben is at the same point now.
In some ways I hope this will be the making of him  not as a cricketer, because we already know how good he is  but as a person.

Local Polls to a wider Democracy
With the latest amendments to the Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and Pradeshiya Sabha Bills passed in Parliament without a division, the path is finally clear for the Local Government polls to be held most likely in January next year. This brings a long delayed opportunity for democratic action by the people, the first since the major political changes in 2015, and also what could be a very keen contest between the two parties in the coalition of national unity  the UNP and SLFP, as well as the ground breaking electoral exercise to the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP), led by Mahinda Rajapaksa, although yet not formally.
While the parliamentary unity of the ruling coalition will remain unchanged, the contests between the UNP and SLFP at local government level will certainly bring in a new level of political rivalry in the country, with major issues of national and political leadership canvassed among the people  between the SLFPs Maithripala Sirisena and the UNPs Ranil Wickremesinghe. In addition to this rivalry will be the SLPP campaigning seeking to establish its position as the main opposition party in the majority Sinhala-Buddhist areas of the country.
The role of the SLPP in these polls will firstly be a challenge to the President Sirisenas leadership of the SLFP, and also a major attempt to show that Mahinda Rajapaksa still has the support of a majority of the Sinhala Buddhist voters. In this context, the coming Local Government polls will be a test of the lay of politics in the country, and should give important signals about the future trend of politics, to be seen whenever the Provincial Council polls are held, and the next General Election due in 2020.
With his leadership of the SLFP now accepted both legally and formally, President Sirisena has taken many initiatives to control the SLFP members within the government, mainly in the Cabinet and key government positions, to move away from their strategies of seeking a new unity between him and Mahinda Rajapaksa. The governments present actions against the forces of corruption has helped in curbing these pro-Rajapaksa groups, as well as, Sirisenas moves to remove the pro-Rajapaksa party organisers at the electoral level and replace them with his own supporters; building his strength within the party, and in many electoral areas.
The Basil line
While the UNP and SLFP will have their own clashes in the coming polls, the complexity of the leadership issue in SLPP was seen with the recent visit of Basil Rajapaksa, the key organiser of the party, to Jaffna, to obtain northern support. Although a brother of MR, Basil remains a not very popular member within the SLFP, due to what many see as his contribution to the defeat of MR in the Presidential Poll in January 2015. He is seen as the major image of corruption within the Rajapaksa Regime that led to the defeat of MR. His failure to contest the August 2015 General Election, and the many charges of corruption brought against him in recent months, makes him a questionable figure for popular leadership of the SLPP, although he certainly is a background manipulator, with little concern for public image, as seen in the days of the Rajapaksa Regime.
His efforts to attract Tamil voters in the North were certainly a twist of the political talk and strategies of the JO and the SLPP. The statement to the Jaffna Press Club that the troops under his brother who was Commander-in-Chief had committed crimes after the separatist war, although stressing they were individual crimes and not war crimes, was certainly moving away from the wide defence of War Heroes by MR and the JO.
Another major shift was his claim the SLPP supported the return of all occupied private lands to Jaffna to their owners. These were clearly strategic shifts to gain some popularity in the North, but it is the stuff that could well bounce back in the South, where the SLPP has to build strong forces on the basis of Sinhala-Buddhist majoritarian policies, the stuff of MR and the JO.
The SLFP under the Sirisena leadership has to vastly strengthen the grassroots movement that was a key factor in the partys success in any elections. It is certainly no easy task today, but is facilitated by the SLFP sharing power. Yet, it also has to face a major challenge from the UNP that remains undivided, although there are issues over corruption that can affect the support of the right wing voters. The SLPP faces a bigger challenge in attempting to show strength as an opposition party of credibility, having to need the services of the likes of Basil Rajapaksa for its strategies, and give confusing messages on its policies towards Tamils and the North.
Constitutional debate
As the campaign for the local polls moves on, the debate on the new constitution also gathers more interest, with Parliament due to discuss the Steering Committee Report of the Constituent Assembly later this month. Although there are many areas of importance in the Steering Committee recommendations, which are not final, the debate is largely focused on two issues, that of the structure of the State and the position of Buddhism.
There are so many twists and turns being given to the recommendations made on both these issues, giving the impression that the critics of what has been stated wish to give the impression that this is the final draft of the new constitution. The debate keeps whirling around the content of the Unitary State, with the most critics showing satisfaction with the present situation, and not even considering any possible improvement. They are concerned about the possible room being made for a Federal State while wholly neglecting to consider the values of the recommended situations on wider power sharing, under a unitary state.
On religion too, there is much criticism for the proposals that would give more meaning and content to the rights given to religions other than Buddhism, as provided in the present Constitution, while preserving Buddhisms foremost place and it is the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana. There are wholly unfounded twists to the recommendations made which, far from reality, seek to show that other faiths will have new and more rights than now, and would thus be a threat to Buddhism.
There is also a regretful confusion, especially in government ranks, about the future of the Executive Presidency, with the SLFP wanting to retain what that party has clearly wanted replaced from the time it was introduced in 1978. It shows the politics of convenience and not that of principle.
One regretful aspect in this debate is that it is largely wangled by the critics, with little heard from the government, which has made broad statements and given assurances to the Maha Sangha about Buddhism. A better debate with more participation by government voices, and not only Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne, a key member of the Steering Committee, would certainly help in showing the public the much wider aspects of the proposed constitutional measures, and giving meaning to a possible referendum to adopt a new constitution, which will do away with the Executive Presidency.
Treasury Bonds and EPF
The Treasury Bond probe is gaining increased public interest with more information being revealed about the role of the Employees Provident Fund, as a Primary Dealer in the bond market, and the evidence of the massive losses that EPF had allegedly suffered in questionable bond dealings.
While the main issue of the bond probe by the Presidential Commission has to do with the large losses to the national budget from the alleged scams, the public interest is certainly heightened with the EPF, the main retirement benefit scheme of employees in the private sector being drawn in. Spread throughout the country, and numbering many millions, fears are now expressed by trade unions and mercantile employees that their retirement benefits could have been adversely affected by the losses suffered by the EPF in secondary transactions, which could even lead to trade union action with a large impact.
The politics of the T-Bond scams was seen with the presence before the Commission of Ministers Kabir Hashim and Malik Samarawickrama who mentioned the need to raise Rs. 15 billion for State needs. They denied that the questionable primary dealer, Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. or its members had made any contributions to the UNP. While the Chairman and General Secretary of the UNP did clear the Party on such approaches, the forgetfulness of the former Finance Minister of the donations given to him for Penthouse occupation, while being a deputy leader of the UNP, shockingly remains.
The public interest will continue as to why the EPF did not bid at key T-Bond auctions as a Primary Dealer, but bid for the same tenure bonds from the secondary market, at a loss to the EPF.

Minister orders continuation of dengue prevention drive
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has ordered the National Dengue Control Unit to implement mosquito control activities without interruption because there is a possibility of dengue increasing with the ongoing rains in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, North Western and Northern Provinces<U+200B>. The dengue control programme in the Northern and Eastern Province was launched yesterday<U+200B>, the Health Ministry Spokesman said.
According to the Spokesman, a total of 158,<U+200B>85<U+200B>4 dengue patients and 394 dengue deaths had been reported from all parts of the country during this year up to October <U+200B>11<U+200B>. This is the highest ever numbers of dengue patients and deaths reported from Sri Lanka so far. There is a possibility of dengue increasing again with on going rains.
Meanwhile, National Dengue Control Unit sources said during the last National Mosquito Control week which concluded on September 26, the inspectors discovered positive mosquito breeding sites in construction sites (6 percent), religious places (3 percent), schools (2 percent) and institutions (3 percent).
If there are dengue patients at home, school or workplace residents should inform the Medical Officer of Health (MOH) or the Public Health Inspector (PHI) of the area for necessary control activities and outbreak prevention. If a large number of school children gets infected with dengue, school authorities should arrange early shramadana activities, the sources said.
If anyone is suffering from fever, they are advised to seek medical attention without delay. Appropriate treatment should be given according to medical advice. Those who are diagnosed with the more severe Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) should be hospitalized for in-ward care. Everyone should ensure protection from mosquito bites during the day time. Children when resting during the day and those who are suffering from fever should be nursed under a net to avoid mosquito bites, the sources added.

Occupational Safety and Health Bill before Parliament soon
The proposed Occupational Safety and Health Bill will be brought before Parliament soon, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said.
Addressing the inauguration of the National Occupational Safety and Health Conference 2017 in Colombo yesterday, he said the new Act will provide a wider coverage and more strength to laws. Several pieces of legislation have been introduced and more will be introduced to ensure the safety and health of employees. According to Minister Seneviratne, the economic cost of work-related injury and illness vary between 1.8 to 6 percent of the GDP in Sri Lanka's estimates and averaged at four percent.
There are many factors which contribute to an accident or injury.
The worker's family situation, home environment and events that took place during the journey to work are some of them.
At present, the maximum compensation paid for a deceased worker is only Rs. 550,000 which is not adequate. Laws will be brought soon to double it (Rs. 1.1 million) without putting the burden on the employer. Alternative arrangements will be made for the employers to ease the burden of paying this compensation, the minister added.
Sri Lanka Nidahas Sevaka Sangamaya General Secretary Leslie Devendra said only 30 percent of the current Sri Lankan workforce is being covered by the Factories Ordinance Number 45 of 1942. The newly proposed Bill will be brought before Parliament soon and passed in order to ensure the safety and health of the Sri Lankan workforce.
National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Director General Dr. N. C. Amarasinghe, Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry Secretary Sunil Abeywardana and others spoke.

Pakistan outplay Sri Lanka by 83 runs to win first ODI
DUBAI, Friday  Pakistan coming out for the first time since they won the ICC Champions Trophy in England in June showed that they had lost none of their composure when they beat Sri Lanka by 83 runs to win the first One-Day International played at the Dubai International Stadium on Friday.
Pakistan fielding the same squad that won them the Champions trophy with the exception of injured fast bowler Mohammad Amir proved more than a handful for Sri Lanka who were simply brushed aside without much ado.
Sri Lanka proved no match for an all-fired up Pakistan side seeking vengeance from their 2-0 whitewash in the Test series.
After running up an impressive score of 292-6, they crippled Sri Lanka through their fast bowlers Rumman Raees and Hasan Ali who picked up two early wickets apiece to have half the side out for 67 by the 16th over and eventually 209-8.
Raees a replacement for Amir pushed Sri Lanka onto the back foot with the wickets of Dickwella (19) and Chandimal (4) before Hasan delivered the crippling blow by sending back Mendis (2) and Siriwardana (0) off successive deliveries.
In between these successes Hafeez bowling his off breaks on a teasing line and length accounted for a struggling Tharanga (18) who got caught in a tangle and was bowled.
The task for Sri Lanka was getting harder as they needed a big partnership like the Babar-Malik to get anywhere close to the Pakistan total. That was not forthcoming and Sri Lanka folded up tamely.
It was not easy batting out under lights with the Pakistani bowlers all over them with their fine lines and lengths that made run making difficult. But there was no excuse for the way the Lankan batsmen fronted up to the bowling. They could have shown more discipline in their batting.
Top scorer for Sri Lanka was Lahiru Thirimanne with a fighting 53 off 74 balls. Dananjaya and Vandersay (25) put to shame some of the top batters when they shared an eighth wicket partnership of 68 of 94 balls which was the highest for the wicket in an ODI at Dubai. Dananjaya went onto score his maiden ODI fifty off 72 balls with five fours and remain not out with Lakmal on seven.
The defeat was Sri Lankas eighth loss on the trot and they need to do something drastic to get out of jail as they had in the Tests. To get back to winning ways Sri Lanka first of all must have a settled batting line up not one that keeps changing from match to match and from series to series. Batsmen should know what their permanent slots are instead of being shuttled to and fro. Until that is done Sri Lanka will struggle to chase or put up totals in excess of 200 against good bowling sides.
Pakistan invited to bat first built their total around Babar Azams sixth one-day hundred. Following the early dismissal of Ahmed Shehzad for a duck in the fourth over Babar who came to the wicket at no. 3 anchored the innings to score a finely paced 103 off 131 balls (5 fours) before being sixth out at 269 in the 49th over.
After a slow start Pakistan gradually increasing the tempo in their batting with Azam blocking up one end and allowing his partners to free their arms at the other. This way he put together two useful stands one of 64 off 77 balls with Fakhara Zaman (43) and the other with the experienced Shoaib Malik that was the cornerstone of the innings  139 off 114 balls the highest fourth wicket stand in Dubai.
Malik playing freely and playing a dominant role slammed 81 off 61 balls that included five fours and two sixes, the first six being the 100th of his career. Relishing Maliks innings from the stands was his Indian wife Sania Mirza, the famous tennis star.
When the partnership was going strong Pakistan looked good enough to finish with a total in excess of 300 but Sri Lanka managed to pull back towards the latter stages picking up three wickets for six runs off eight balls once they broke the partnership through Suranga Lakmal who accounted for both Malik and Babar to finish with 2 for 47.
Despite the fall of quick wickets Pakistan still managed 89 off their last 10 overs which gave them a competitive total.
Sri Lanka did not fancy taking their chances on a re-laid pitch and after Tharanga won the toss decided to field first.
However as it turned out to be there was not much for the bowlers although it was on the slow side and Sri Lanka were left regretting why they did not bat first.
Sri Lanka showed vast improvement on the field being very slick and their bowlers bowled a disciplined line and bowled to their fields although Chandimals miss at mid-on off Babar at 42 may have cost them the match.
However one could not fault Sri Lanka for allowing Pakistan to score as much as they did because this was an experienced batting line up and the batsmen knew exactly when to press on the accelerator.
A lot of focus was placed on opener Fakhar Zaman, the hero of Pakistans Champion trophy win over India in the final with a century but after scoring 43 off 45 balls he was undone by Akila Dananjayas googly.
Mohammad Hafeez made 32 off 38 balls before becoming a victim of Jeffrey Vandersay.
Hafeez could not make use of a successful review when he was saved by the thinnest of edges on an lbw dismissal and was dismissed the next ball attempting a pull that ended in a catch to long on.
Babar Azam was made Man of the Match.
The second and third ODIs will take place at Abu Dhabi on October 16 and 18 before moving to Sharjah.

PM ORDERS IMMEDIATE RELIEF FOR DISASTER VICTIMS
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday ordered to speed up post-disaster relief activities and complete compensation payment to people affected by floods and landslides by November.
The Prime Minister made this instruction chairing a progress review meeting in South, which was attended by the public officials in Galle, Matara, Ratnapura and Kalutara, the four districts worst affected by the torrential rains lashed in May and June.
The Prime Minister, observing that the compensation payment has been unduly delayed despite the Government disbursing the necessary funds long time ago, pitched into the authorities asking as to why they failed to pass that money to the affected people immediately.
Tell me an exact date you can finish the post-disaster relief work. Do not further delay them, the PM said while noting that the economy in the affected areas could have been restored by now had the affected entrepreneurs, businessmen and the tea industry received compensation swiftly.
The PM pointed out that 1,361 applications were received to obtain compensation for damaged houses and shops in Matara totalling to Rs 356 million but not a single payment has been made by October 10. The National Insurance Trust Fund (NIFT) has to give reasons as to why such a delay occurred, he remarked.
A sum of Rs 7.5 billion is to be paid as compensation for people affected. Rs 2 billion of that amount are for business entities.We had asked you to pay this money as soon as possible. The District Secretaries have informed that they approved and sent all the money needed. Then how did this delay happen he questioned.
The PM was highly critical of the lethargy of officials that he even said at one point that dropping down currency notes from air using helicopters for anybody in the ground to collect could have been a better option considering the inordinate delay shown by the authorities. He instructed the officials to use the disbursed money before the end of this year, reminding them that those allocations would not be available to be used next year.
The Premier, commenting on the Athwela loan scheme, requested the State Banks to give loan facilities to those starting new business ventures.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardena and Sagala Ratnayake participated in the meeting alongside the PM.

PTL Chief Dealer blows lid on millions paid to EPF,ETF informants since 2014
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Chief Dealer Nuwan Salgado was cross examined at the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday. Salgado gave controversial evidence before the Commission last Thursday (12) with regards to certain payments done by PTL to several alleged informants.
According to Salgado, Perpetual Treasuries Limited was giving money to informants who supplied confidential information to them from the Employees Provident Fund and the Employees Trust Fund and other institutes in the Treasury bond market.
Salgado, a whistle-blower for PTL, gave evidence at several previous occasions against his employer.
Salgado also submitted a report on Thursday, which was allegedly on the said payments given by his company to informants.Salgado also said that these said informants were paid money by his company in millions even when former Central Bank Governor Ajit Nivard Cabraal was in office.
According to the report submitted by Salgado, within the six months from July 17 to December 31, 2014, these informants were paid by the PTL monies totalling more than Rs. 94 million. According to Salgado PTL has been paying for its informants continuously from its commencement as a Primary Dealer in 2014.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisenas legal representative Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa, yesterday questioned Salgados position. According to Indatissa PC, these transactions were not illegal. He pointed out that these transactions are included in the RTGS system maintained by the Central Bank.
It was evident that Salgado wavered from his position. However, at the re examination, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera pointed out that what Salgado said was that he realised these payments to be bribes from the document he maintained on the said payments.
Salgado also gave evidence on Thursday with regard to certain informants of PTL in state institutes such as the EPF and the ETF.
According to Salgado, there were two informants for the PTL in the EPF, who were referred to as Charlie. Accordingly, from 2014 to 2015, the informant Charlie for the PTL from EPF was a dealer name Udaya Seelan and from 2016 to 2017, Charlie was Indika Saman Kumara, who was the Chief Dealer of the EPF.
Indatissa PC questioned as to how Salgado knew for exact that Charlie was either of these people. Salgado said the EPF dealer was referred to as Charlie in the dealing room. Indatissa PC was of the position that Salgado was not sure in his answers and has changed from his earlier position.
Salgado could not identify who are meant by the nicknames Car and Tango, as he gave evidence on Thursday. Indatissa PC pointed out that the said Car in fact, was not an informant as Salgado alleged but a purchase regarding a vehicle. Salgado said he did not know who or what meant by Car.
At the re examination of the witness, SASG de Livera questioned Salgado on his involvement in preparing the document he provided to the Commission on Thursday.
SASG Livera: Who provided information to you for this document
Nuwan Salgado: Kasun Palisena.
SASG: How
NS: Verbally.
SASG: So, Kasun Palisena knew about the existence of this document
NS: Yes.
SASG: Has Kasun Palisena ever accessed this document
NS: Yes. He looked at it in my computer where it was maintained.
SASG: So it was only you and Kasun Palisena who knew about this document
NS: Yes.
SASG: Did you at any stage save this document in any other machine
NS: It was only in my desktop computer. Since I have emailed it, it can be downloaded as well. I emailed this documents updated version several times to Kasun Palisena in 2014 and 2015.
SASG: So there were identities mentioned in the document as Charlie, Car and Tango. You said these were persons who were supplying market and price sensitive information to the PTL
NS: Yes.
SASG: You said Charlie was Udaya Seelan and Indika Saman Kumara
NS: Yes. They were referred to as Charlie in the dealing room.
SASG: Did you know any other persons referred to as Charlie
NS: No.
SASG: Who told you about Car and Tango
NS: Kasun Palisena
SASG: You said this money was paid for informants yesterday
NS: Yes.
SASG: Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked you specifically yesterday whether this money was given as bribes. And you said that it was the realisation I had. Do you stand by that evidence
NS: Yes.
SASG De Livera then questioned Salgado as to why he deleted this document from his desktop computer. The witness said that he did not want to have such a document in his computer. He also added that he did not want anybody else to access the document through his computer and it was the reason why he deleted the document.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked as to why Salgado named the persons mentioned in the document as informants. Of all the words you could have used, you used the word informant. Why Justice Jayawardena questioned.
Salgado said that was the realisation he received. Justice Jayawardena also asked Salgado if Palisena had seen this word in the document. Salgado said in fact Palisena did.
Did he not ask you to change the heading Perhaps to Charitable Donations! Justice Jayawardena quipped. Salgado said Palisena asked him to change it, but went on with the marking informant as it was the realisation he got.
The afternoon session started with PTL dealer Kaushitha Rathnaweera taking the witness box. He was questioned on several cheques he got from W.M. Mendis and Company. According to Rathnaweera, he got these cheques from Mendis and Company, encashed them and gave the money to Kasun Palisena, his CEO.
According to Rathnaweera, two office assistants of the company also encashed similar cheques and gave the money to Kasun Palisena.
Justice Jayawardena also questioned Rathnaweera on the cheques.
JJ: These cash cheques relate to money paid by the PTL to Perpetual Asset Management, Perpetual Capital Holdings, W.M. Mendis and other group companies, on account of treasury bond and bill transactions. From time to time they gave cash back to PTL.
Then you will encash those cheques and give money back to Kasun Palisena which apparently is kept in his office. Did not non-PTL persons come to his office from time to time 
Rathnaweera: That I dont know.
Justice Jayawardena while observing that all these cheques amounted to Rs. 6 million or more, asked Rathnaweera if he asked from his CEO about these large stacks of money. Rathnaweera said he did not make any inquiry from his boss. There is something called human curiosity. Based on that, why did you not ask about the money The witness said he did not ask about the money since it was not his business.
Monetary Board member Nihal Fonseka is to appear before the Commission on Monday. The Attorney Generals Department informed the Commission that there would be more telephone call recordings which will be produced before the Commission on Monday as well.

The Elections Commission is to hold a meeting on October 19 to discuss the legal implications of the leader of the New Democratic Front (NDF), Shalila Moonasinghe not being a Sri Lankan citizen.
Moonasinghe who was the former Litro Gas Chairman, is facing legal charges over hacking into a Taiwanese bank and has been remanded until October 25. Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya speaking to the Daily News said they would have to review the existing laws, but the current premise is that if a voter has to be a Sri Lankan citizen to vote, it is only natural that the candidate too should hold citizenship in the country.
The Chairman of the Election Commission however was quick to add that at this stage they could not disqualify a party over this issue.

The building of tampita vihara; the temples built on pillars was popular in Sri Lanka during Kandy and Gampola periods. Two hundred and four tampita viharas have been recognised by now, while six of them have been preserved. The preservation work is being done on another 85 tampita viharas. The President directed the relevant sections to provide adequate human resources for this task.
The President was recently presented a book on a research done on the tampita viharas in Sri Lanka. The book was published by the Samkathana Research Unit of Kelaniya University's Humanities Faculty. During the discussion the attention was paid on the proposals suggested in this book.
They discussed on commencing of a program to train lay and clergy guardians to preserve and maintain tampita viharas.The governments program to protect and preserve the places of archeological values was reviewed at this meeting.
The President directed the officials to implement a special security program to protect places of archeological values in remote areas, with the help of Police, Civil Security Force and Archeological Department.
He further directed the officials to expand the prevailing security in the places of archeological values including the places in the North and the East, provided by the Civil Security Force.

Sri Lanka reviews Grant Compacts progress with US Millennium Challenge Corporation
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera who is in Washington, USA, to attend the WB/IMF annual meeting, on the sideline of its meeting met Regional Deputy Vice President for Europe, Asia, Pacific and Latin America in the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Fatema Z. Sumar to review the progress of its five- year Grant Compact to Sri Lanka.
In December 2016, MCCs Board of Directors selected Sri Lanka to develop a compact. Sri Lanka became eligible for assistance after passing 13 out of 20 indicators on MCCs policy scorecard.
MCC is an independent agency working to reduce global poverty through economic growth. MCCs grants and assistance to Sri Lanka is an immense contribution to Sri Lankas efforts for good governance, fighting corruption and to protect and promote human rights.
Sri Lanka is receiving about USD 700 million within a period of five years from the MCC to invest in three priority areas - policy stability, access to land and transport.
A delegation from the US Governments Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) led by Fatema Z. Sumar, visited Colombo in July to advance progress on the development of the MCC compacta five-year grant programwith the Government of Sri Lanka that aims to reduce poverty, and promote economic opportunity for Sri Lankans.
During the visit, following the signing of an MoU with the Secretary to the Treasury Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, MCC announced Rs. 1.1 billion ($7.4 million) in funding to Sri Lanka to support the development of a compact, including identifying and analyzing specific projects for potential investment.
The Sri Lankan Government has established a project management unitthe Sri Lankan Compact Development Teamwithin the Prime Ministers office to work with MCC on the compact. The goal is to develop a high-quality, evidence-based and sustainable compact aimed at addressing these economic challenges in a way that drives growth and reduces poverty. MCC holds partner countries accountable through rigorous oversight, monitoring and evaluation.

## Title: Stronger Sri Lanka-Finland ties

Stronger Sri Lanka-Finland ties
The Nordic countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden) are among the most advanced economies in the world. They constantly come on top of the best places to live indices, with minimal crime and corruption. Living standards are really high in these technologically advanced countries. No country in the world can neglect having a sound relationship with the Nordic countries.
Most Sri Lankans are aware of Norways peace facilitator role in Sri Lanka, but they have very little idea about the countrys links with the other Nordic countries. Norway hosts a large Sri Lankan Diaspora population, so almost everyone in Sri Lanka knows a friend or relative living in Norway.
But this knowledge does not extend to the other Nordic countries and diplomatically too, we should have a more robust relationship with the other four Nordic countries. These countries have constantly stood by Sri Lanka (despite some countries not having full-fledged embassies here) at all times. Despite the anti-Norway rhetoric of certain patriots, Norway has been involved in peace processes around the world, not only in Sri Lanka. Not every attempt was a success, but no one can deny that Norway has a genuine desire to see peace around the world. The same goes for the other Nordic countries, which are among the most peaceful countries on Earth. There is a lot we can learn and gain from these countries.
In this context, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes recent visit to Finland was a historic occasion that helped forge closer ties between the two nations. The Prime Minister, during his short stay in Finland, called on his Finnish counterpart Juha Petri Sipila and discussed their common commitment to strengthening ties between the two countries especially in the field of energy and waste management, with a forward-looking and a business-minded approach.
Finland has pioneered near-shore ocean wave energy, which is now regarded as one of the most efficient renewable power sources, second only to wind and solar. The wave energy devices being developed and tested today are highly diverse, and a variety of technologies have been proposed to capture energy from waves. Some of the more promising designs are undergoing testing on commercial scales at sites in Finland.
It has been proposed that wave energy plants would be utilised as part of the implementation of Sri Lankas energy plan to make the maximum use of the countrys vast coastline and potentially immense wave energy resource. With this aim in mind, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the AW Energy facility during his official visit to Helsinki. AW has expressed willingness to support Sri Lanka to produce wave energy and AW Energy Chief Executive Officer John Liljelund has said they are ready to extend their fullest support to Sri Lanka for producing energy through waves. This is an opportunity that should not be missed, since Sri Lankas energy needs are soaring and the country must turn to renewables to lessen the dependency on thermal fuels which are going to run out any way.
The Prime Minister also visited a prominent waste management and recycling facility in Finland to see how that country is coping with the problem of garbage. This issue came to the fore in Sri Lanka with the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage mound. The Government has since taken many steps for proper solid waste management, including the banning of certain types of polythene. It will highly beneficial if we can obtain Finnish assistance, technology and expertise for garbage disposal and management. The idea is not to think of garbage as waste per se, but to make use of it to generate power and harness it for other uses.
The two countries must also explore the possibility of developing tourism and people-to-people contact, possibly through long-haul Finnair flights to Colombo from Helsinki. Some third-party airlines already serve this sector on a charter basis, but scheduled flights by a national carrier will be a better option. Sri Lanka should undertake a tourism campaign in Finland and other Nordic countries whose outbound travellers are affluent high spenders.
Trade and investment is another area of concern, as there is great potential for higher volumes of trade between the two nations. Representatives of the Confederation of Finnish Industries have told Prime Minister Wickremesinghe that they are willing to invest and explore business opportunities in Sri Lanka. They had lauded the investment and business friendly environment in Sri Lanka, pledging to become more involved in opportunities in Sri Lanka.
Finlands IT expertise could benefit Sri Lanka in a big way, as there are already plans for a digitalization cooperation agreement to be signed by the two countries next month. This is also a great opportunity for Sri Lankas IT community to learn from Finnish experts in the field. This will help efforts to create a paperless society.
The national Unity Government has extricated Sri Lanka from the foreign relations abyss created by the former Government, which picked an unnecessary fight with the West. Stronger Finland-Sri Lanka ties show the unequivocal success of the Governments pragmatic foreign policy.

The hill Country Tamil society has now developed remarkably. It is due to the level of education that we have achieved over the years. There are scholars, directors, lecturers, teachers, lawyers and even judges in our society today, said CPC Education (Tamil) Minister Marudhapandy Rameswaran.
"These achievements are attributed to the unstinting services of our past leaders who chose the correct path in the political arena, while today's colourful Sahithya Vizha in Nuwara Eliya is entirely and solely contributed to the hard work extended by the teachers and students from different corners of the hill country," he added.
He was speaking at the Tamil Sahithya Vizha held at the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council Auditorium recently.
The CPC Governor Niluka Ekanayake, Asst. High Commissioner of India Radha Venket Raman, CPC high officials and many other dignitaries graced the occasion.
Rameswaran further said, last year when his Ministry conducted a cattle rearing awareness programme in Nuwara Eliya, President Maithripala Sirisena who was the Chief Guest appreciated the school children who played a vital role in that event. "Similarly, the teachers, students and directors from the hill country schools contributed immensely towards the success of this Sahithya Vizha. I thank all those who stood by me in bringing forward our language, culture and heritage here in Sri Lanka," he said.

Waugh weighs in on Ben Stokes saga
Whether you like it or not, you become someone that people look up to. Someone that kids look up to.
Former Australia captain Steve Waugh has declared England has no chance of retaining the Magellan Ashes if star allrounder Ben Stokes is not available following his arrest in Bristol last month.
And Waugh, who was at the helm in 57 Tests for 41 victories during a golden era of Australian cricket, tipped the home side to claim a convincing victory in the five-Test series, which starts in Brisbane on November 23.
Stokes was arrested in the early hours of September 25 on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and later released after an altercation with several men. The incident allegedly left a 27-year-old man requiring hospital treatment for facial injuries.
Police are probing the incident, while ECB's independent Cricket Discipline Commission has launched an investigation.
Stokes will not travel with the squad when they depart London on October 28 and may not tour altogether pending the outcome of the investigations.
Waugh said an Australia player in the same situation would not be selected.
England without Ben Stokes, if he doesnt come, I dont think they can win the Ashes, Waugh said on Sky Sports Radio.
I think if it was anyone in the Australian side, they wouldnt be picked.
You cant do that these days in public. It just didnt look good and its a bad image for the game.
I think they (England selectors) are pretty keen for him to play in Australia  hes probably their best player, so it would be a real shame if hes not out here.
Without Ben Stokes, well win. I cant see England winning and its too much pressure on (Stuart) Broad and (James) Anderson, and theyre getting a bit older, and I cant see them playing five Test matches straight.
I think Australia will win 3-1.
England great Kevin Pietersen has also said Stokes should not be on the plane to Australia.
I can hardly watch the bit at the end, it is horrendous.
That 45-second video is brutal, Pietersen told The Sunday Times.
"The more you watch it the more shocking it is. I have watched it with some influential leaders in business and the general view was, you cannot represent your country with a video like that going around. It is a view I agree with.
Whether you like it or not, you become someone that people look up to. Someone that kids look up to.
Stokes averages 35.72 with the bat and 33.93 with the ball from 39 Tests, underlining his value in Englands set up, and he is fourth in the ICC allrounder Test rankings.
Waugh also weighed in to the debate surrounding who should stand behind the stumps for Australia in the Ashes, with incumbent Matthew Wade attracting criticism from some quarters for his performances with the bat in India and Bangladesh.
NSW gloveman Peter Nevill, who last played Test cricket in November 2016, and emerging South Australian Alex Carey have been touted as possible replacements.
Were talking about whos going to be the keeper and they tend to focus on the keeper scoring runs, not how hes taking the ball, Waugh said.
Nevill was doing a great job and then got dropped and now Wades improved his keeping and theyre talking about dropping him.
Youve got to be fair to Matthew Wade now, I guess, he kept pretty well in the subcontinent, so its difficult to know where they go from there.
Players will have an opportunity to stake their claims for selection with three rounds of the JLT Sheffield Shield to be contested before the first Ashes Test.

## Title: Why Test cricket still needs its fifth day

Why Test cricket still needs its fifth day
After some weeks in the jungle, Philip Halden decided the best thing to do was teach his kidnappers to play cricket. Halden, a 48-year-old engineering consultant from Stoke-on-Trent, was snatched while he was working in Bogota in 1996. He persuaded one of the guards to lend him a machete, and took what he described as great pains to carve a really heavy Gooch-type bat and a whole batch of balls, then set about instructing them in the Laws. The guerrillas were Marxist-Leninists and neither they nor his fellow captives, a Dane and a Colombian, particularly enjoyed the game, except in that it took so long to play it killed a lot of time. It was eight months before the three were finally freed.
This, then, was a rare case of strangers to the game finding its length to be the most appealing thing about it. Nothing about Test cricket seems to boggle newcomers to it quite like the fact it lasts so long, which is the very thing those of us who love it like the most. I hardly think, Tom Stoppard put it when he first saw live baseball, that I can be expected to take seriously a game which takes less than three days to reach its conclusion. Test matches have, of course, been known to go on more than twice as long without finishing. The Beckettian timeless Test between England and South Africa in 1939 lasted 11 days before they finally called it all off.
Time was when Tests were scheduled to last three, four, or many more days. Five days, the length of a working week, has been the standard since 1979. The only exception since the ill-starred Super Test between Australia and the Rest of the World in 2005. That was scheduled to last six, but finished in three-and-a-half. It was supposed to be the first in a series, repeated once every four years, but the idea was abandoned exactly one hour after the inaugural match was over, its only legacy a lingering argument between the ICC and assorted cricket statisticians over whether or not the match should have official status, since the regulations state that Test matches shall be of five days scheduled duration.
Thats about to change. Cricket South Africa wants to stage a four-day day-night Test against Zimbabwe this winter. Theyre going to petition the ICC for permission at the Chief Executives Conference in New Zealand next week. And given that the games many mandarins have been talking up four-day Tests for some time now, it seems CSA is likely to get its way. Officials from England, South Africa, Sri Lanka and New Zealand have all spoken out in support of the idea in the last year or so. Their thinking is that since so few games last more than 400 overs, you can squeeze them down by stretching play later into the evening and making the players get through more overs in the day. This game is likely to be the first of many.
Between them, the executives have put forward a bunch of reasons, all variations on the seven-letter theme mo money. New Zealands David White wants to do it because it will mean they can fit a three-match series into 18 days, whereas right now, when you add in the rest days between back-to-back matches, they take closer to 26. Sri Lankas Thilanga Sumathipala wants to do it because he thinks that if play stretches on for another 45 overs each evening, then the games will pull in bigger crowds after work each night. Englands Colin Graves, who made his name running Costcutter, believes it will reduce expenditure for the grounds and the broadcasters. All three agree that if matches are cut to four days, then they should always run from Thursday through to Sunday.
The players, fans, and, it seems, pretty much everyone else who has publicly discussed the issue seem to be on the other side of the argument. A couple of South Africas players came out against it just this week. I dont think you should tinker with something thats not broken, said Dean Elgar. There are other formats that are being experimented with. I dont see why Test cricket should suffer. And heres Faf du Plessis: I am a fan of five-day Test cricket. I believe the great Test matches have gone to the last hour of the last day on day five. Thats what is so special about Test cricket.
Add to that the MCC, whose new chief executive, Guy Lavender, came out in support of five-day Tests in the Telegraph, and the ICCs own cricket committee, who decided just a couple of years ago that Test matches should not be shorter than five days, with the caveat that the game will need to be open to considering proposals in the future that look to enhance the public appeal of crickets oldest format. Aside from the brute economics of it, this seems to be the key argument for shortening Test cricket.
Something has to be done! And this it seems, is what the administrators have decided something should look like.
They say that fewer Tests go to a fifth day, which is true, but around six out of every 10 played still do. And the best of them, like the Tests between England and West Indies at Headingley, and Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi, are as good as this game gets, a better advert for it than anything the ICCs marketing consultants have concocted. There are good arguments for rationalising the calendar and decluttering the fixture list, but the case for cutting off the fifth days play is less convincing. Cricket administrators with grand plans are like Greeks bearing gifts. Its best to be wary. theGuardian

The World Standards Day 2017 : STANDARDS MAKE CITIES SMARTER
World Standards Day is celebrated every year since 1970, on October 14, to recognize the collaborative efforts of the thousands of experts who share their knowledge and expertise in international standardization activities. This day also provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of standardization among the producers, traders, consumers, researchers, public and regulators. The National Standard Bodies take a lead to organise various activities to celebrate the World Standards Day.
The Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) is the National Standards Body of Sri Lanka having a vision providing leadership to uplift the quality of life of the nation, through standardization and quality improvement in all sectors of the economy. The SLSI also joins to celebrate the World Standards Day along with the rest of the world on October 14, 2017. Coinciding with the World Standards Day, SLSI has declared the National Quality Week during October 9 to 15, 2017.
Within the framework of the World Standards Cooperation (WSC), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) have chosen Standards Make Cities Smarter as the theme for this year's World Standards Day.
Half of the Earths current population lives in towns and cities. Most people can agree that cities are places where large numbers of people live and work; they are hubs of government, commerce and transportation. According to United Nation forecasts, urban areas are projected to house 60 per cent of people globally and one in every three people will live in cities by 2030. Sri Lanka is no exception where this trend is concerned.
Challenges to local authorities
An increasing number of people are migrating from rural to urban area pose many challenges to local authorities, among them alarmingly high rate of traffic fatalities, traffic congestion, large scale environmental pollution, exploitation of resources, social disintegration, crime and violence, urban diseases, data security and privacy. Climate change and natural disasters can also aggravate social inequalities and degradation of quality of urban living. So, it has created a sense of urgency to improve the quality of life in our cities now for the benefit of future generations.
The concept of the Smart city is frequently offered up these days as one answer to many of the problems of metropolitan living. For some, Smart cities means green cities. For others it means green energy, better services, intelligent buildings or simply more efficient transportation. Now many countries are increasingly embracing the Smart city notion and they are already experiencing the luxuries of improved services through intelligently design, integrate and interconnect strategies and systems equal opportunities cohesion along with sustainable balance.
One out of 17 Millennium Development Goals adopted by world leaders at the United Nations Sustainable Development Summit in 2015 is to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable. Therefore, sustainable urban environment is vital to achieve much needed sustainability goal. But it cannot be achieved without significantly transforming the way we build and manage our city spaces.
The different ideas and ways of achieving them make it hard to know where to begin and how best to address the engineering challenges which helps everyone involved agree what constitutes superior practices and how they will follow it. One of the most urgent tasks is simply to agree the common language that is being used so that people know what is on offer, innovators can explain the benefits of their solutions and city authorities can spend public funds with confidence in the outcomes. To do this, we need standards; agreed ways of doing things published openly. Cities need a way to assess where they are, aim for where they need to be and measure their progress along the way. Standards fill that need and will support smooth, integrated and sustainable Smart City development.
International and national standard bodies have already identified its necessity and playing leading role in creation of smart cities towards the improvement of quality of life in urban citizens by developing and publishing relevant standards to support equitable, efficient and sustainable and resilient urban development. The successful implementation and compliance of the series of standards serve as a framework and incentive mechanism for propose, plan, monitor and evaluation of the urban development projects over time, assess their performance, an effective tool to foster urban development and tailor toward more sustainable and resilient communities.
Standardized indicators
Having understood this global requirement and the necessity of adopting relevant international standards locally, SLSI has published SLS 1508: 2015 Sustainable development in communities- Indicators for city services and quality of life and SLS 1507: 2015 Smart community infrastructures- Review of existing activities relevant to metrics.
SLS 1508: 2015 will enable cities to work with set of standardized indicators to measure and monitor progress of delivering city services and quality of life. In the context of a city, citizens are customers, insofar as citizens pay taxes to the cities they call home. So what would a tool look like that helps demonstrate and measure that a city is meeting the expectations of its citizens That's where city standardized indicators come in.
They help cities assess where they stand through comparison with other cities and analyze gap, consistent tracking and prioritize solutions. Standardized indicators mean that cities everywhere use the same measures, making it easier to collaborate and shares best practices, experience and knowledge from other cities globally in areas such as education, energy, environment, finance, emergency response, governance, health, recreation, safety, security, telecommunications, transportation, urban planning, real time information, water, sanitation, waste management, resilient to climate change and natural disasters and more. And also standards help cities to better manage by enabling systems to work together and stimulate to find out future oriented innovate solutions to procure reliable and cost-effective systems which are recognized by international entities. Such solutions are often referred to as Smart.
Infrastructure is improving living standards and addressing resource efficiency but sometimes conflicts with a path to sustainability. As a result, it is imperative that infrastructures contribute to sustainability and resilience of communities more effectively and efficiently. SLS 1507: 2015 addresses community infrastructures such as energy, water, transportation, waste, information and communication technology (ICT).
Integration of the smart community infrastructure standards helps to improve the lifestyles of its citizens by reducing costs, increasing mobility, accessibility and reducing environmental pollutants. The metrics in this standard will support urban managers in planning and measuring performance and also compare and select procurement proposals for products and services to improve community infrastructures. Therefore adhering to internationally agreed standards, is essential when integrate of various infrastructure systems into urban environment to ensure technologies make interoperable, safe and efficient.
A number of plans and projects to build Smart cities are currently underway in Sri Lankan urban development policy framework. Smart parking, smart mobility, smart power grids, smart street lighting, smart building, smart care, smart city maintenance, green environment, robust information technology connectivity and digitization, e-governance and many other smart characteristics would be plan to incorporate.
It is much important to understand the standards involvement in Smart city development and have to move one step ahead by implementing and complying with standards. Then we could improve our quality of life in urban environment, bring more benefits and value to the country, encouraging sustainable development and sustain our communities with sensible management of natural resources and ultimately country will be able to drive forward to make a top-tier country in the world.

Morphine increasingly used in SL as painkiller
Using Morphine as a painkiller is significantly increasing in Sri Lanka, Consultant Community Physician attached to the National Cancer Control Programme of the Health Ministry Dr. Suraj Perera said.
Addressing a media seminar on the Palliative Care Day held at the Health Ministry Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said the World Palliative Care Day falls on the second Saturday in October every year and this year, the day falls today (Saturday October 14). Palliative care services are still developing in Sri Lanka.
According to Dr. Perera, Palliative Care is an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families who face problems associated with life-threatening illnesses, through the prevention and relief of suffering by identifying and impeccable assessing and treating pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial and spiritual.
The main objectives of providing Palliative Care is to provide relief from pain and other distressing symptoms, to affirm life and regards dying as a normal process, to integrate the psychological and spiritual aspects of patient care and to offer a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death. It intends neither to hasten nor to postpone death, he said. Palliative Care includes offering a support system to help the family cope during the patients illness and in their own bereavement.
It uses a team approach to address the needs of patients and their families, including bereavement counselling, if indicated. It will enhance quality of life, and may also positively influence the course of illness. It is applicable early in the course of illness, in conjunction with other therapies that are intended to prolong life, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and includes those investigations needed to better understand and manage distressing clinical complications, he said.

All Blacks dominance threatens the health of international rugby
Never in the history of sport has there been an international team as dominant as the All Blacks. The New Zealanders have lost only two games since winning the 2015 World Cup  an exhibition against Ireland in Chicago and the second Test against the combined might of the British and Irish Lions, which they played with 14 men for almost three quarters of the game after Sonny Bill Williams was red-carded.
The All Blacks dominance might be wonderful for rugby in New Zealand, but questions remain as to whether it is positive for Test rugby and the health of the game in other countries. This is particularly true for Australia, as the Wallabies play the Kiwis more often than any other team.
While New Zealand has been the top country in world rugby for more than 100 years, the All Blacks have not always been invincible, especially at the World Cup from 1991 to 2007 when they were regularly knocked out in the play-off stages.
The All Blacks would dominate Test rugby in between World Cups only to choke at the showpiece event, giving the likes of Australia, England and South Africa an opportunity to claim the mantle as the worlds best team.
But the All Blacks have now won the last two World Cups in 2011 and 2015 and it is not beyond the realms of possibility they will remain undefeated until they lift the Webb Ellis Cup again in Japan in 2019.
This kind of dominance is abhorred in other sports. Most professional sporting competitions have introduced drafts and/or salary caps to maintain parity among teams, seeing it as detrimental for one side to win all the time, but these sort of equalising mechanisms are not applicable to Test rugby.
If the All Blacks cannot be brought back to the field, it is up to other nations to lift their standards to try to match them. So who will challenge the All Blacks for world supremacy It might seem like a fantastical exercise, but there are a few contenders.
Under former Wallabies coach Eddie Jones, England are certainly mobilising their forces to make a genuine assault on the World Cup in Japan, instilling the same will to win that the men in white had in 2003. Rugby supporters around the globe are salivating at the prospect of England hosting the All Blacks at Twickenham in November next year, but that is a long time to wait to see the Kiwis knocked off their pedestal.
In the meantime, the Wallabies and the Springboks look as if they have turned the corner, raising hope that a famous win against the All Blacks is not too far away. Both Australia and South Africa gave the All Blacks a run for their money in the Rugby Championship, narrowly losing epic contests in Dunedin and Cape Town respectively.
It is a little bit sad when Australian and South African supporters get excited when the Wallabies and Springboks go close against the All Blacks. Is that as good as it gets A gallant defeat You cannot forget that the All Blacks also inflicted record defeats on the Wallabies and the Springboks in the same competition. Thats the thing about the Kiwis, when they are on they are unbeatable and when they are off they almost always win anyway.
France, of course, are always a wildcard at the World Cup, having knocked the All Blacks out of the tournament in 1999 and 2007 and almost upsetting them in the final in Auckland in 2011. The All Blacks play France in Paris on their end of year tour. Les Bleus always step up when they play New Zealand and will be a formidable opponent.
The Wallabies will get the next crack at the All Blacks in the third Bledisloe Test in Brisbane on 21 October . With the All Blacks having already won the Bledisloe Cup for a record 15th consecutive time, the game in Brisbane is a dead rubber, but that expression is not part of the Kiwi vocabulary. The All Blacks have an insatiable hunger to win every single game they play. Until the pretenders to the throne can match that desire, they will not beat them and that will not be good for rugby.
The yawning gap between the All Blacks and the rest of the world may turn Test rugby into a great, big yawn. - theGuardian

nation lost a young leader
We commemorate Adhil Bakeer Markars first death anniversary. Adhils sudden demise in London last year in October shocked not only his family - the whole nation shared their grievances with his family expressing sympathies, condolences and visiting his family members.
Adhil represented a prominent political family from Hakeem Villa in Beruwala. He was the fourth son of veteran politician and a former Cabinet Minister Imtiaz Bakeer Markar and grandson of the late Deshamanya Al.Haj Mohamed Abdul Bakeer Markar, who served the country being in different portfolios; as a Speaker of Parliament of Sri Lanka, Cabinet Minister and Southern Province Governor. Adhil obtained his primary education at the Royal College, Colombo and completed his Advanced Level at the Asian International School in Colombo. He successfully completed his Bachelor of Laws from the University of London and entered the Sri Lanka Law College where he passed out as an AttorneyatLaw.
He was a director at the National Youth Services Council, Economic Affairs Ministry and Policy Planning. Adhil represented Sri Lanka at the 68th United Nations General Assembly in 2014 being an official Sri Lankan Youth Delegate to the United Nations. He delivered a passionate speech at the United Nations General Assembly urging the islands youth to build bridges between their communities.He came to London to complete his Masters in Comparative Politics at The London School of Economics and Political Science on a Chevening Scholarship, a prestigious award, which designed for future leaders funded by the UKs Foreign and Commonwealth Office. After his unexpected death, the London School of Economics (LSE) especially set up a blog for his friends to leave memories and messages of sympathy.
The Evening Standard newspaper in London reported his sudden death saying Mr. Bakeer Markar had been tipped as a future head of his nation.
Adhil belonged to an illustrious political family immortalised in the history of Sri Lankan Parliament for reasons of their honesty and integrity in politics. Sri Lanka lost one of talented young future leaders and academics. May the Almighty Allah grant him the highest place in Jannah.
