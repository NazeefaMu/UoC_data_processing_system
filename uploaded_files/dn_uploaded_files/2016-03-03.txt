Malaysian Customs seizes 159 kg in smuggled ivory
MALAYSIA: Malaysian authorities said Wednesday they had confiscated 159 kilograms (350 pounds) of ivory smuggled by air passengers, the latest seizures in a country used as a key Asian transit point in the illegal trade.
Customs officials, who said the haul was worth $382,200, displayed the seized elephant tusks at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
They said two Vietnamese men were arrested at the airport upon arrival last Saturday after they were found to be carrying bags containing 101 kilograms of ivory. Later that day, another bag containing 58 kilograms was discovered at the airport. Authorities believe that bag belonged to a Vietnamese passenger who had flown in from Ethiopia, bound for Hanoi. Authorities said they were still looking for that third suspect.
Traffic, the wildlife trade monitoring group, said the latest haul showed poachers were adopting new methods.
"Large volumes have traditionally been shipped by sea. So this clearly shows that smugglers are diversifying their methods," said Kanitha Krishnasamy, Traffic's programme manager in Southeast Asia. The international ivory trade, with rare exceptions, has been outlawed since 1989 following the decline in the population of African elephants from millions in the mid-20th century to just 600,000 by the end of the 1980s.
But criminal gangs continue to exploit demand, mainly from Asia.
Tusks and other body parts of elephants are prized for decoration as talismans and for use in traditional medicine across parts of Asia, with China being a major market

## Title: Now for the Clifford Cup k/o

Now for the Clifford Cup k/o
With the league rugby season for the year over, where Kandy Sports Club won it for the 17th time in 22 years, it's time for the Clifford Cup knockout rugby. All eight clubs will be seen in action. The first quarterfinals are fixed for March 11, 12 and 13 and the semi-finals for March 19 and 20 and the final on March 26.
The Clifford Cup is the most prestigious club rugby knockout tournament in Sri Lanka and arguably the oldest rugby tournament in Asia. The Clifford Cup commenced in 1911 and has been played continuously since 1950. The tournament began as a competition between the Mercantile executives in Colombo and Planters in the hill country.
This is how the Clifford Cup came into being. In 1911 Lady Elizabeth Clifford (the wife of the acting Governor of Ceylon, Sir Hugh Clifford) was interested in the annual rugby football fixture Low Country versus Up Country, and expressed a wish that a match take place in Colombo on her birthday, 26 August, between teams representing the United Services Kandy and All Ceylon.
Due to unforeseen circumstances the scheduled date was put off by a week and the first Lady Clifford Cup match (as it was originally called)[ was played on 2 September 1911, with the United Services Kandy team defeating All Ceylon 25 points to 0. The All Ceylon team was composed entirely of European expatriates and the United Services team of members of the army and police force. In 1914 the Army regiment from which many of the United Services were drawn was transferred from Ceylon following the outbreak of World War I.
At one time Up-Country and Low Country group leaders clashed for the richest prize in the local rugby scene - the Clifford Cup. Then came a knockout system, searching for the ultimate strength of the two top slot occupiers for the respective groups. Thereafter came the overall knockout system considering the fact that the reputation in the league was nothing.
Once again the format of the tournament was changed and the leader of the league tournament was considered the winner of the Clifford Cup. In 1975, the format was further adjusted to give prominence to the teams who are able to score the highest number of goals.
It looked as the system denied the team with the best record from a top position unless they crowned their victories with more and more tries and goals. Now the Clifford Cup competition has come a long way with most of the clubs winning it.
Then came the competition for the clubs in 1950, and today this is the oldest rugby tournament in Sri Lanka, the first clubs to play in the Clifford Cup were Havelock SC, CH & FC, CR & FC, Dimbulla A & CC, Kandy SC, Uva, Dickoya MCC and KV.
Kandy Sports Club has won the Clifford Cup a record 19 times, including a consecutive period of ten years between 1995 and 2005 (the competition was not held in 1998) and six consecutive years between 2007 and 2012.
In 2006 Kandy SC and Navy SC both withdrew from the tournament (Kandy due to dispute over the ground allocation and Navy as their members were called up for national service duty), the Cup was won by the CR&FC.
The CR&FC have won it 14 times, including a tie with Dimbulla ACC, Havelocks SC have won it 13 times including a tie with Police SC, Police SC 8 times with ties against Havelock SC and Army SC, CH&FC 7 times, Dimbulla A & CC twice including a tie with CR&FC, Army SC twice with one tie with Police SC, whilst Air Force SC and Navy SC have only won the cup once.

82nd Battle of the Saints': Joes certain of putting up a good performance
St. Joseph's College are confident of getting the better out of traditional rivals St. Peter's College when they confront each in their cricket encounter at the SSC grounds on Friday and Saturday.
The Darley Road school has produced some magnificent players who have gone on to represent the country with much pride. Late Gerry Gooneratne, D. S. Jayasundera (who was considered as the fastest bowler in Sri Lanka in the 1940s), Fairlie Dalpathado, Malcolm Spittel, Hector Perera (snr), Malcolm Francke (who went on to represent Queensland in the Sheffield Shield tournament in Australia) and Brian Obeysekera who played for Sri Lanka in unofficial Tests.
St.Joseph's has also produced some fine Test cricketers of the calibre of Ashley de Silva, Michael van Dort, Chaminda Vaas, Test and ODI captain Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera, Ian Daniel and Dimuth Karunaratne.
Vaas, a fine left-arm fast bowler represented Sri Lanka with distinction claiming over 300 wickets in Test cricket in a career which spanned 14 years. His match bag of 10 wickets against New Zealand at Napier in 1995 gave Sri Lanka their first overseas Test win.
Karunaratne who came into the Test team late last year scored a superb 85 in the second innings against Australia in the third test at Sydney. Mathews has rendered yeoman service to the Sri Lanka team during the last seven years and become an integral figure in the side.
This year, the Josephians are led by Sandaruwan Rodrigo. The Darley Road school has won six matches outright against Mahanama Colombo, Maris Stella Negombo, De Mazenod, Mahinda Galle, Wesley and St. Anthony's Katugastota but they suffered defeats at the hands of Royal Colombo and St. Benedict's.
St. Joseph's will heavily depend on Malshan Rodrigo, who has been the only batsman to make a century this season. They will also depend on Revan Kelly who has scored 650 runs along with vice captain Kevin Corteling.
Shevon Fonseka and Malshan Rodrigo who has totalled more than 500 runs, Sri Lanka Youth player Jehan Daniel, Nipun Sumanasinghe, Vimukthi Peiris, Thashan Peiris and Dineth Madurawala are the others who can make useful contributions with the bat.
To avert the powerful Peterite batting pressure will be in the hands of Malshan Rodrigo and Harin Cooray who have taken over 130 wickets between them. Ruchira Ekanayake and Charuka Ullandupitiya are the others who will strengthen the bowling department.
The Josephians are coached by Asela Pathirana who will be assisted by fielding coach Dharantha Menerigama.

Clinton, Trump win big on Super Tuesday
US: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton took a giant step toward securing the White House nominations of their parties Tuesday, thumping rivals in a slew of Super Tuesday primaries.
Bellicose billionaire Trump weathered a barrage of attacks from fellow Republicans to win at least seven of 11 states, according to projections, coming within striking distance of becoming the Republican nominee to replace President Barack Obama.
Clinton also racked up seven wins -- her strategy of embracing President Barack Obama appeared to pay dividends.
She beat rival Bernie Sanders handily across a host of southern US states -- Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas -- winning big among African-American voters and reversing a 2008 primary loss in Virginia.
The former secretary of state also claimed Massachusetts, in a close race.
Sanders notched wins in his tiny home state of Vermont, Oklahoma, Colorado and in Minnesota, but he now trails heavily.
Both Trump and Clinton signaled their focus is beginning to shift to the general election.
In victory remarks, Clinton attacked Trumps pledge to make America great again.
America never stopped being great! she said to cheers from supporters in Miami.
Its clear tonight that the stakes in this election have never been higher, and the rhetoric were hearing on the other side has never been lower.
Trump painted Clinton -- the former first lady, senator and secretary of state -- as a Washington insider, who cannot address a furious electorates desire for change.
Shes been there for so long. I mean if she hasnt straightened it out by now, shes not going to straighten it out in the next four years, he said.
A recent CNN/ORC poll found that both Clinton and Sanders would easily defeat Trump if the general election -- set for November 8 -- were held now.
But few are likely to underestimate the 69-year-old Trump after his primary rout.
Super Tuesday was the most pivotal day of the US presidential primary season so far, with half the Republican delegates and a third of Democratic delegates needed to win the nominations up for grabs.
Trumps victories were widespread, from Alabama and Georgia in the deep south, to Massachusetts in the northeast, to the vital battleground state of Virginia.
The scope and scale of the victories will sow terror among establishment Republicans, who fear the party of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan could face general electoral annihilation.
While Trumps rivals Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz struggled to make the case they can still win, Trump tried to defuse an intra-party feud that may be the only serious obstacle remaining on his path to the nomination.
He offered an olive branch to party leaders who are fighting a rearguard action, making the case he can unify and grow the party.
I think well be more inclusive and more unified. I think well be a much bigger party, Trump said, easing up on his hallmark bombast.
Cruz used victories in his home state of Texas, with its bumper haul of delegates, and in neighboring Oklahoma to argue he is the only Republican who can beat Trump.
For the candidates who have not yet won a state, who have not racked up significant delegates, I ask you to prayerfully consider our coming together, uniting, he said.
Rubio was projected to win only in Minnesota, fundamentally undermining his claim to be the representative of mainstream Republicanism.
But he ended the day in Florida -- a clear signal that he wants to win his own home state, which votes on March 15.
For good measure, his campaign also announced events in Kentucky, Kansas, and Louisiana, in an attempt to pre-empt questions about his future.
But it might be too little too late, with polls showing Trump with a commanding lead nationwide. The CNN/ORC poll gave Trump 49 percent of support nationwide, with Rubio a distant second at 16 percent and Ted Cruz one point further behind.
Rubio and Cruz may both harbor long-shot hopes that Trump fails to win enough delegate support to secure the nomination outright, leaving the convention to decide the nominee in July.
They may also be betting that whoever emerges strongest from a brutal 2016 campaign would be the prohibitive favorite in four or eight years time .

Iranian voters chose Right and Proper Path, says Rouhani
IRAN: Iranian voters chose the right and proper path for the country, moderate President Hassan Rouhani said today after final election results showed his allies had made significant gains.
Fridays twin elections -- to parliament and to top clerical committee, the Assembly of Experts -- were crucial for the president and a de-facto referendum on his administration after its nuclear deal with world powers.
In the parliamentary election, hardliners who vocally opposed Rouhanis diplomacy with the West and his moves to open Iran up to foreign investment were soundly beaten by reformists. Conservatives also lost seats.
The owners of this country are the people... they determine the path and direction of this country, the president said.
I thank our intelligent and brave people who have taken a step forward, he said at an auto industry conference in Tehran.
Buoyed by new backing from reformists supportive of the government, the president urged a spirit of cooperation among MPs from across Irans political spectrum.
If there are still some who think that the country must be in confrontation with others, they still havent got the message of 2013, he said, alluding to his landslide presidential election victory on a pledge to end years of standoff over Irans nuclear programme and crippling sanctions.
No single group won a decisive share of parliaments 290 seats, but tallies suggested the pragmatic Rouhani would be able to forge a working majority.
The main conservative list secured 103 MPs, reformists and moderates 95, and independents 14, while five seats went to minorities and four to candidates with no single affiliation.
While conservatives were wiped out by reformists in Tehran, they retained some seats in other cities and enjoyed strong support in rural areas.
Some 69 constituencies had no clear winner, meaning a second round runoff in April in a field that has more conservatives than reformists and moderates.
The outcome signalled strong public support for the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers, an agreement steered by the president which saw the lifting of sanctions in January.
Cooperation should be everyones concern. Today the era of confrontation is over, Rouhani added.
Fridays second election for the Assembly of Experts also produced high-profile gains for Rouhani and his closest allies.
Two renowned hardline ayatollahs lost their seats on the 88-member assembly, which monitors supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khameneis work and will pick the 76-year-olds successor if he dies during its eight-year term.
By contrast, 15 of the 16 candidates running in Tehran on the list headed by Rouhani and his veteran political backer, former president Ayatollah Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, were resoundingly voted in.

The schools season looms and much praise for the vision that still ensures Singers magnanimous partnership...that is the SLSRFA lifeline and its future across the island. The 7s gave S. Thomas a great morale boosting win over the mighty Isipatana, a final which could have swung either way till the last 3 mins ... the win gave STC rugby a fair step for the league season just around the corner. Coach Lagga will have to instill more work rate, and some hard graft, in the Thora forwards to last the season and challenge the bastions, at Royal, St Peters, Trinity, Isipatana,..etc. Singers schools division 1 is a massive crowd puller and lessons for all sport and sporting institutions Sri Lanka wide ...lets hope the committee are able to grow the format and create more interest in the north, the east and southern provinces this season.
The knockouts loom in 2 weeks ...the players rest ... recover ..injury manage, rehab, and recharge the mind ....a vital factor in the quest for renewed high performance and work rate, in the next round for clubs. All told the gladiators run out again, and the hunger, separating the warrior from the soldier.
The reality of survival for clubs is not a theory ...its stark and needs careful scrutiny beyond convention. My old club CH & FC - home to many household names who boldly stood up across playing arenas, locally and internationally....Saman Jayasinghe, Baratha Hegoda, Apisai Nagata, Ravi Wijeynathan, Rohan Abeykoon, Nazeem Mohamed, Hisham Abdeen, Jude Pillai, Bimal Perera, and Graham Rauxmake up a small but impressive bunch of pure rugby warriorsthe kind that gave dimension to the game, and played for pride with skills that defied description. The list at CR, Havies, Kandy, Police, Army, Navy and Air Force ...equally impressive and definitely deserves their place in club and Sri Lankas rugby history.
I anticipate a masked ball, much glamour and the whos who of SRi rugby to grace the annual occasion. The union as host would be quite splendid.
Rugby is a true hard gladiator sport in all its disciplines ...and I salute those who stand for its values and principles its intense and all or nothing for that time in the middle ...we give it our maxwe defy science ...we scale past our deepest fears and rely on our inherent strength and courage to survive.
Words are hardly the code ...but the rules matter  respect is the universal language.
Bula bula the union code ...long may it prosper for generations to enjoy.
