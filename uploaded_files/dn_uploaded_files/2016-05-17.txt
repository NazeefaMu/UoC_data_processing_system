For the betterment of the television industry in Sri Lanka, Raigam Tele-awards Ceremony was born, providing evaluation with proper judgment.
One of the unique features of Raigam Telees is the selection of a special visual theme. This theme is evident from the invitation card to the stage decorations.

The following years had Sigiriya, the Taj-mahal, the Colour Spectrum and the Sooriyakantha Mirror and Birds eye. The theme for last year when Raigam Telees celebrating its eleventh consecutive performance was Meaningful tele-contribution of an eleven-year voyage, perfectly balance like 11.

As an industry there are thousands of artists and technicians engaged in the television industry in Sri Lanka. Out of hundreds of entries for the event there are about 120 nominees for various awards less than 40 in number. The efforts of Nominees are also equally valuable as final winners but there is no room to appreciate such capabilities at the Awards Ceremony due to time and other constraints.

Raigam Telees pioneered this international standard in Sri Lanka. Once again, Raigam Telees has made all arrangements for the artists as well as viewers to experience a grand scale Nomination Evening.

Craja brings the history of Sigiriya
The Swarnavahini television channel, part of the EAP Broadcasting Company recently launched its latest historical teledrama series, Craja, which highlights the epic and emotional tale of King Kashyapa. Craja was allocated as one of Swarnavahinis biggest production budgets to date and was conceptualized and directed by Jackson Anthony. Currently airing its fifth episode, the series retells the story of the controversial sovereign Kashyapa, who converted the Sigiriya rock into a residential palace and fortress during his reign from 479 to 497 CE.
Today the Sigiriya Rock Fortress is considered a national wonder and is heralded as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Craja, which is aired on Swarnavahini every Saturday at 8.30pm, brings to light the heart-wrenching story that is interwoven into Sigiriyas ancient past and highlights the early days of King Kashyapas rule.
The series features an impressive line-up of leading actors and actresses including Bimal Jayakodi, Akila Dhanundra, Yashoda Wimaladharma, Roshan Pilapitiya and Sathischandra Edirisinghe. The entire script is based on an extensive research study, which was conducted by Anthony prior to production. Anthony is recognized as one of the Sri Lankan cinema industrys most renowned and versatile professionals. Having made his mark as an actor, he has also made significant contributions to the local industry as a director, producer, singer, novelist and lyricist. In his latest masterpiece, he carefully retells King Kashyapas story with both artistic flair and poignancy.
The Craja teledrama series is based on historical facts and was produced to invoke curiosity and remind the Sri Lankan public of the rich heritage of the majestic Sigiriya Rock Fortress. The conversion of Sigiriya marks an important milestone in the life of King Kashyapa and today Sigiriya stands as a lasting reminder of the capabilities and power of Sri Lankas early rulers. We put a great deal of effort into ensuring that the series is factually accurate and we hope that it will provide a thrilling window into the mystery, allure and tragedy that surround the Sigiriya Rock Fortress and King Kashyapas reign. I would like to extend my gratitude to the entire crew and production team for their tireless commitment, which has resulted in the creation of a high-quality and truly captivating series, shows director Jackson Anthony stated in a release.
The Craja teledrama series explores important questions about the fortress and the kings life. The story highlights why King Kashyapa built Sigiriya, it provides more information about the architect behind the fortress as well as the artist who created the famous wall of frescoes. King Kashyapa was the son of King Dathusena and the dramatic entanglement between them is retold in Craja. The series depicts the many different aspects of King Kashyapas character and skillfully retells the story of his rise to sovereignty and his fall from power.
Often referred to locally as the Eighth wonder of the world, Sigiriya stands at 370m above sea level and has an extensive network of fortifications, gardens and water features that have been built using complex construction, architectural and engineering skills that are far beyond their time. Some important aspects of the fortress include the frescoes of the Sigriya maidens, the lions paws that stand at the stairway entrance and the mirror wall (which is believed to have been polished so thoroughly during the kings rule, that he was able to see his reflection in it).
The Sigiriya Rock Fortress is globally recognized as an important historical structure as it demonstrates the sophisticated urban planning skills and progressive technical capabilities that were prevalent in Sri Lanka as far back as the third century.

Top Ten finish for Jaden and Aaron at Asian Road Racing Championship
The round two of the Asian road racing championship was held in Thailand last Sunday at the Chang International circuit. Young brothers Jaden and Aaron both clinched top 10 positions in their respective events. Jaden rode a Honda mono cylinder 250cc for the second consecutive year, while Aaron opted to join the Suzuki Challenge on the new EFI 150cc this year. The young Sri Lankans did not have it easy as they were up against the all Japan Champ Hiroki Nakamura and the son of former MotoGP rider Noriyuki Haga as well as top names from Australia, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, China, Chinese-Taipei, Vietnam, Nepal etc.. Aaron who finished 10th on the grid and Jaden 14th in their respective events, worked their way through the experienced riders on the race day to finish among the top ten.
A Proud father Shane Gunawardena said he is really happy about Jadens performance, perhaps even happier for his younger son Aaron as he has no experience in running underbone motorcycles and what made him proud was the fact that he was among the best in Asia. A top ten finish was what they targeted and I am glad that it was achieved.
The next Asian Championship would be on the Suzuka Circuit in Japan and Jaden would be riding the two hour endurance race too.
Shane also went on to say that It has not been easy for them especially with their studies, therefore they would be reluctantly compelled to skip a couple of local meets including the National Championship rounds.

Lochte takes 200 IM crown at Charlotte meet
Washington, Monday: World record-holder and triple Olympic medalist Ryan Lochte won the 200-meter individual medley title Sunday at the US Pro Swim Series meet in Charlotte, North Carolina.
The 31-year-old American won in 1min 58.97 with countryman Conor Dwyer, a world and Olympic relay swim champion, second in 2:00.90 and Hungarys Norbert Szabo third in 2:01.56.
Lochte, who won the 400 IM title on Friday, set the 200 IM world record of 1:54.00 at the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai. He took Olympic 200 IM silver in 2004 and 2012 and bronze in 2008 and is the reigning Olympic 400 IM champion. It was a solid meet, especially for where I am right now in my training, Lochte said. Im still training kind of hard and I didnt rest at all for this meet. Lochte hopes to defend his 400 IM gold and take another shot on the 200 IM crown at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in August, but he must first qualify in the US team trials.
With six more weeks, its time to tune up some things and get ready for trials, Lochte said.
Three Canadians took titles -- Dominique Bouchard in the womens 200 backstroke in 2:09.14, Penny Oleksiak in the womens 100 free in 53.41 and Santo Condorelli in the mens 100 free in 48.41.

American Leah Smith won the womens 800 free in 8:27.79 for her third title of the meet, having earlier taken the 200 and 400 free.

Lowry stars as Raptors down Miami to make history
Los Angeles, Monday: Kyle Lowry is relishing the prospect of taking on LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers after leading the Toronto Raptors into the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in franchise history on Sunday.
Lowry scored 35 points as Toronto completed a 116-89 win over the Miami Heat to seal a 4-3 series victory -- and set up a showdown with James and the Cavs on Tuesday.
Toronto will start against Cleveland with the odds stacked against them, having battled through two marathon seven-game series to reach the conference finals.
Cleveland however head into Game One well rested after back-to-back 4-0 sweeps in the previous rounds.
Yet Lowry said he is looking forward to pitting his wits against the in-form James and the likes of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Im looking forward to the opportunity to playing against those guys, Lowry said. LeBron is one of the best players in the league, Kyrie (Irving) is always a tough matchup, Kevin Love is always a tough matchup. But were going to go out there and play our game, try and do our job and see what happens.
Raptors coach Dwane Casey says the challenge posed by Cleveland will be another step for us as his team chase the ultimate dream of an NBA Finals victory.
I think weve done everything we set out to do, but again, were not done yet, said Casey. This group is hungry and never say never. I know one thing, our guys will compete.
Lowry and teammate DeMar DeRozan stole the show as Toronto powered their way to a convincing victory in front of a raucous home crowd at Torontos Air Canada Centre. AFP
