Time is opportune to formulate new constitution
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP) have formed a consensus government to finalise and adopt a new constitution for Sri Lanka as we do not know who would be elected as the Executive President in the future; so let's use this opportunity for the betterment of the country," Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the gathering at the third Sathyagraha campaign, 6.2 million on alert, which is carried out island-wide, held opposite the Sacred Bo Tree in Matara last Friday (24) evening. TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran, Ven. Dambara Amila Thera, NSSP Leader Vikramabahu Karunaratne, religious leaders and activists who supported the National Movement for a Just Society attended.
The government of good governance proved that no one is above the law by Prime Minister's presence at the Bond Commission. the Minister said.
Power should be devolved for every citizen to live amicably as one family and Sri Lanka to prevail as one nation, TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran said.
He related a story of a family of three girls and a boy. "They were to decide where they were going to spend their school vacations. "Every time a vote was taken, the girls had the majority until the boy was forced to revolt against the democratic process, he said.
Ven. Dambara Amila thera said the late minister, N. M. Perera, forecast that the executive powers vested by the new constitution formulated by the National Assembly in 1978 would be disastrous someday for the country.
NSSP Leader Dr. Vikramabahu Karunaratne said MP Sumanthiran was in Matara to address people of the south in Sinhala because he has faith in the present government.
In the past, northern politicians who addressed people of the south in Sinhala were assassinated by northern extremists. "Sumanthiran has ignored this threat as this duration may be the last opportunity to adopt a new constitution, he said.

Abusers drown toddler
Two men had drowned a toddler in a water barrel after failing in their attempt to sexually abuse the childs mother.
The incident took place in Wallimathagama village in the Kataragama Police division.
The two men had reportedly thrown the two and a half-year-old girl into a water barrel after their attempt to molest the childs mother failed.
The incident occurred while the father of the child, who is a fisherman, was away from home.
At the preliminary investigations by the police, it was revealed that the two unidentified men had tied the mother and child with ropes and dumped the child into a water barrel at the back of the house and fled.
After untangling herself, the mother had immediately informed her husband about the incident with the help of the neighbours. They later found the child floating in the water barrel and rushed her to the hospital. However, the child was pronounced dead upon admission. The Officer-in-Charge of the Crime Branch of the Kataragama Police Station along with the other officers has launched a special operation to apprehend the culprits.

Committee to consider UNICEF proposals on eliminating child abuse
A special committee will be appointed to look into the recommendations made by the United Nations International Childrens Fund (UNICEF), based on its report on Sri Lankas justice system in order to eradicate crimes against children, Foreign Employment and Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale said, yesterday.
She gave this assurance at a ceremony held to introduce a report titled A Legal and Institutional Assessment of Sri Lankas Justice System for Children, which was compiled by the UNICEF. It was presented to the Minister by UNICEF Country Representative Tim Sutton.
Minister Atukorale said the report would greatly help the governments efforts to create a safer environment for children.
In order to achieve this, she said a committee would liaise between government institutions such as the Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Women and Childrens Affairs, Child Protection Authority, Police and the Attorney Generals Department, which would provide resources for this cause.
According to the report, the minister said, the UNICEF had proposed the procedures to be followed to ensure child safety and steps to be adopted to reduce child abuse.
Meanwhile, she said the Justice Ministry had taken all measures necessary to complete Court cases dealing with crimes against children on the instructions of the Attorney Generals Department.
The UNICEF has launched many programmes with the support of the Justice Ministry that had helped to reduce child abuse in the country. It, however, remains the responsibility of the parents and officers of the Child Protection Authority to ensure that this becomes a reality, she said.

DRI seizes 9.293 kg gold biscuits at Thondi
Close on the heels of Q Branch police seizing 6.856 kg of gold biscuits smuggled from Sri Lanka, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) has seized 9.293 kg of gold biscuits, smuggled from Sri Lanka, at coastal Thondi after detaining two persons.
Acting on specific intelligence, DRI teams from Thoothukudi and Madurai made the seizure on Monday evening at the Thondi bus stand when the two persons, acting as agents of smugglers, came to board a bus to Chennai, DRI officials said.
Enquiries revealed that a person received the contraband from a contact in Sri Lanka on the high seas off Thondi and brought it to the shore. On being handed over, the two persons, identified as Saravanan (40) and Ramadoss (41), set to carry the smuggled gold to Chennai when the officials intercepted them.
The accused were in possession of eight gold biscuits with foreign markings and each weighed one kg, the officials said. They said few of the pieces were found moulded. The accused, who hailed from Paramakudi, would be produced before the jurisdictional magistrate court in Madurai and remanded in judicial custody, the officials said.
The DRI has made the seizure a week after the Q Branch police had seized 6.856 kg of gold after detaining a person at Mandapam south fishing jetty on November 20.
This was DRIs major seizure after it had seized 28 kg gold biscuits, smuggled from Sri Lanka in three different places, including the East Coast Road, near here and Sayalkudi in July. - The Hindu

Extraordinary gesture of friendship from President Moon
President Maithripala Sirisena received an unexpected warm welcome from Korean President Moon Jae-In yesterday, a day ahead of the scheduled official meeting.
President Sirisena, who arrived in Seoul yesterday morning visited the famous Jogyesa Temple and was surprised to find President Moon waiting to receive him together with the Most Ven. Seol Jeong, head of the Jogye Order, the most prominent Buddhist sect in Korea.
President Moon said, although he was not scheduled to visit the temple, he decided to come unannounced as he wanted to show his respect for President Sirisena. We have so many things in common and I wanted to meet him and develop friendship and rapport before I meet him officially, President Moon said.
President Sirisena said that although he had visited many countries as President, he could not meet a single leader before the official scheduled meetings.
This magnanimous gesture of humbleness shows the greatness of President Moon and his affection for Sri Lanka and its people, he said.
President Moon said that he has many things in common with President Sirisena as both came from rural areas and struggled for years and served the people amidst difficulties to reach the current high positions. The two countries also have common historical experiences as both were under colonial domination, both faced militant movements, there were authoritarian regimes and finally both have reestablished democracy and entered into the path of rapid progress and taking effective steps to combat corruption.
Most Ven. Seol Jeong blessed the two Presidents and expressed the hope that the two humble leaders of their peoples would be able to carry forward the two countries and the people towards progress.
President Sirisena expressed his happiness about the opportunity to visit Jogyesa Temple in which the sacred Buddha relics gifted by Anagarika Dharmapala in 1913 have been enshrined.

Fantastic Beasts 2 director defends keeping Johnny Depp for sequel

While thefirst picture fromFantastic Beast 2caught attention for featuring Jude Law as Dumbledore, many fans were disappointed by the inclusion ofJohnny Depp.
The image confirmed thePirates of the Caribbeanactor would once again play the villainous wizard Grindelwald despite ongoing backlash against him following domestic violence accusations from ex-wife Amber Heard.
Director David Yates has since spoken about the controversial casting, tellingEW: Honestly theres an issue at the moment where theres a lot of people being accused of things, theyre being accused by multiple victims, and its compelling and frightening.
With Johnny, it seems to me there was one person who took a pop at him and claimed something. I can only tell you about the man I see every day: Hes full of decency and kindness, and thats all I see. Whatever accusation was out there doesnt tally with the kind of human being Ive been working with.
Yates then reportedly pointed out that Depps exes  Vanessa Paradis, Lori Anne Allison and Winona Ryder  had all come to the actors defence, saying: Its very different [than cases] where there are multiple accusers over many years that need to be examined and we need to reflect on our industry that allows that to roll on year in and year out.
Johnny isnt in that category in any shape or form. So to me, it doesnt bear any more analysis. Its a dead issue.
JK Rowling previously defended Depps casting, saying she was delighted the actor took the role, adding: "He's done incredible things with that character.

Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed Fisheries Director General to take immediate measures to issue the Gazette notification banning the light-coarse fishing method.
Although this method of fishing was banned in the Southern sea a few years ago, some fishermen had started engaging in this method again causing harm to the marine eco-system.
After considering the situation, the minister instructed Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando to take immediate measures to issue the Gazette notification with regard to the ban on light-coarse fishing. During the Progress Review Meeting held on Monday at the Ministry, Minister Amaraweera had also instructed the Sri Lanka Navy and Coast Guard to take legal action against those who engage in this banned method of fishing.
During the meeting, the fisheries community charged that small-scale fishermen are in difficulty of catching enough fish to find their daily income. Scientific studies conducted by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) also stated that fisheries resources have been badly affected due to this illegal practice.

Govt. to take over quarters breeding mosquitoes
Official quarters occupied by government servants in the Kandy district, which have turned into dengue mosquito breeding grounds due to poor maintenance, will be taken over from the occupants by terminating their lease agreements, Kandy GA H. M. P. Hitisekara said.
Hitisekara was addressing a meeting of the Kandy District Dengue Prevention Committee presided by Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake, at the Kandy Kachcheri on November 27.
Hitisekara said there had been a sharp decrease in the incidence of dengue in the Kandy district in October, compared with September. This was largely due to the action by dengue eradication committees set up at regional and rural level. He said these committees should be further strengthened by engaging the business community in their membership.
Hitisekara said the Kandy district reported 519 dengue patients in October and the number of deaths had been restricted to one due to the untiring efforts of the health staff.
Steps had also been taken to file legal action against 207 persons who had dengue mosquito breeding grounds in their premises. He said 168 fogging rounds had been conducted in the district so far.
Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake appreciated the service rendered by all including medical officers of health, PHIs and other health staff in combating dengue. Their service was all the more valuable when considering the shortage of PHIs in the district, he said.
Steps would be taken to resolve this problem by recruiting more PHIs, he said.
District Director of Health Services Dr. A.M.S. Weerabandara, Epidemiologist Dr. Sameera Hewage and other committee members attended the meeting.

Nethicumaras FR petition dismissed
The Supreme Court yesterday refused to grant leave to proceed with a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Shanil Nethicumara involved in his family business Salaka seeking an Interim Order preventing CID from arresting him.
This is over an allegation that he posed death threats to Wijith Wijesuriya over Anika Wijesuriya giving evidence at the Bond Commission against Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Anil Goonaratne refused to grant leave to proceed with the petition stating that there is no legal basis to proceed with the petition.
The petitioner has named IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director SSP Shani Abeysekara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Nethicumara states that what was essentially a personal dispute has been deviously manipulated by Wijith Wijesuriya, the brother of Anika Wijesuriya and other interested parties into an allegation of threats to a witness before the Bond Commission.
The petitioner states that he became aware through the media that Yasantha Kodagoda PC, Additional Solicitor General had on October 1, 2017 informed the Bond Commission, that the petitioner had made death threats against Anika Wijesuriya.
The petitioner states that when he became aware of the above on October 17, 2017 he lodged a complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station against the fourth Respondent for assaulting and threatening him at the said Love Bar Club on October 14, 2017.
Nethikumara said on October 18, 2017, several national newspapers too reported that Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC informed the Bond Commission on October 17, 2017 that Anika Wijesuriya who gave evidence before the Presidential Commission fled the country due to death threats posed to her by various parities affiliated with Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Petitioner states that the newspaper articles implied that SASG Yasantha Kodagoda had informed the Bond Commission that the Petitioner posed death threats to Anika Wijesuriya directly.
The Petitioner states that he was taken by surprise to read the claim that Anika Wijesuriya fled the country due to death threats posed to her by the Petitioner, as he learned from reports published that Anika Wijesuriya left the country on October 6,2017, 7 to 8 days before from the date on which the telephone conversations occurred.
The Petitioner states that he apprehends that he will be subject to arrest by the Criminal Investigation Department under the provisions of the Assistance to and Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015 which stipulates that bail can be granted only under exceptional circumstances by the Court of Appeal.
Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris with Sajith Jayawardena under the instructions of Sanath Wijewardena appeared for the petitioner. Counsel Asthika Devendra appeared for the respondent. Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Attorney General.

North, East politicians must work for coexistence, ethnic harmony - Bandara
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Youth Front Chairman Shantha Bandara urged politicians in the North and East to dedicate and work for coexistence and ethnic harmony.
Similar to politicians in other parts of the country, the politicians in the North and East should also work to build ethnic harmony and coexistence, Bandara said addressing a press conference of the SLFP Youth Front at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
Political leadership of the North and East is duty bound to stand for ethnic harmony. Certain behaviours such as a recent incident of a politician, who refrained from hoisting the National Flag, may harm the coexistence and ethnic harmony. It is a duty of everyone to respect the National Flag and the National Anthem, he added. Speaking on preparations of the SLFP for the fourthcoming Local Government election, Bandara hopefully said discussions between SLFP and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will come to a favourable end. He presumed that the SLFP will obtain a significant victory at the LG polls. He urged the some UNP backbenchers not to criticise the President over the Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue. He said the SLFP formed the government with the UNP to bring much benefits to the country and its people. He hoped that most parliamentarians in the Joint Opposition will assist President Sirisena to further strengthen the SLFP.

SLPA loss Rs. 3.5 billion due to East terminal not developed in time: Mahinda
The delay in the development of the Colombo Port East Terminal led to a loss of Rs 3.5 billion to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
The minister was speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, when the Finance Heads of his ministry were taken up. As at present, large ships could only enter the CICT terminal of Colombo Port handled by a private firm. If this facility was developed at the East terminal, the SLPA could get a huge income. The previous Government had called for tenders to import necessary machinery to develop the East terminal and the tender was ready to be awarded. However, the interim government which took office after that called it off. Had we proceeded with the tender, the East terminal would be now competing with the CICT terminal. We have estimated the SLPA incurred loss at Rs 3.5 billion due to the failure to develop the East terminal, he noted. We can no longer bear this loss. The SLPA depends heavily on the East terminal. We will soon start developing the East terminal with Cabinet approval. President Maithripala Sirisena at a public occasion recently assured that the East terminal would continue to be under the SLPA. It would not be given to another party, he added. Commenting on the Hambantota Port Joint Venture, the minister said the Treasury had agreed to reimburse the money it spent to settle the debt of the port after the agreement comes into effect. A USD 1500 million loan had been obtained to construct the Hambantota Port. Last year Rs 10 billion of the SLPA profit was spent to service the debt. As a result, last year our profit was less than Rs 1 billion. This year Rs 12 billion is needed to pay the debt.
The Treasury took over the debt payment following the joint venture agreement. Because of that reason, we have been able to raise our profit upto Rs 11 billion, he said.
Magampura Company employees will receive three fold compensation, their jobs
The 464 employees of the Magampura Company would receive a substantial compensation, while their jobs will guaranteed in new companies attached to the Hambantota Port, said Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe in Parliament yesterday.
Those employees would receive compensation three fold of the amount they are legally entitled to, said Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. If they need they could get jobs in the new companies. But they have to apply for them. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera and myself discussed this matter with the Chinese Companies and could come to these terms on behalf of them.
He made these observations in response to the joint opposition and some other members statements they made during the Committee Stage Debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of Ports and Shipping Ministry, Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Ministry and Disaster Management Ministry. Those members questioned the position of the employees of the Magampura Company which was attached to the Ports Authority when the Hambantota Port was handed over to the Chinese Companies.
Minister Samarasinghe also said that it was he who confirmed 284 employees of the 464 employees in question in their positions when he was appointed the Minister.
Minister Samarasinghe further responding to the members, said that this year the Ports Authority had earned a profit of Rs 11 billion. He added that an additional bonus would be granted to the employees of the Ports Authority at the end of this year.

He made this request yesterday during the round of questions for oral answers while querying on the incident from Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.

MP Pathirana brought to the notice of the House that an Army officer of the Urban Development Authority the previous day to the incident had called the Mayor via the phone and asked him to remove those items within 24 hours. However, they had failed to remove the items within 24 hours, MP Pathirana said. That very night, all the items had been taken away by persons attired similar to that of Army personnel. They had told that the items had been taken to the Urban Development Authority. The following day the site had been changed completely and there was only a lawn. It was like the military operation that eliminated Prabakaran.
It was Ok that they were items of a the Children Park, said Minister Ratnayaka. In the same manner journalists were made disappear and lawns were laid on their graveyards.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said that he would look into the matter as he was not aware of the incident.
Govt. to provide compensation to rebuild damaged houses due to natural disasters
The loss caused to the country due to floods and landslides is around Rs 70,000 Million, while there was no proper mechanism in providing relief to those affected, said the Minister of Disaster Management Ministry Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
During the past, only Samurdhi beneficiaries received compensation during natural disasters. However, this government has now devised a mechanism to provide compensation to rebuild damaged houses, while people are also provided with assistance to build houses that could withstand such natural disasters, he said.
Minister Yapa made this statement joining the Committee Stage Debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of the Disaster Management Ministry in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister said for the disposal of garbage and related issues, the government had allocated Rs. 100 million.
In the case of disaster situations, the government would construct safety centres to house people affected during disasters in 25 districts. For those living in vulnerable areas, we will provide Rs. 1.6 million to purchase a land and Rs.1.2 million to construct a house. This is a great advancement from what was given to people in such situations in the past, he said.
For the relocation of people living in vulnerable areas in Kegalle, Hambantota, Kalutara, Ratnapura, Matara and Galle districts, Rs. 1.3326 billion has been provided to the district secretaries, Yapa said, adding that these monies would be granted in stages.
Achieving countrys sustainable development goals by Labour Dept. must be appreciated: Seneviratne
Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said the countrys labour force is its back bone and promised to actively participate in uplifting the countrys productivity while protecting the rights of the workers.
He said instead of implementing development projects in the country, the Labour Department is compelled to engage in resolving strikes and technical conflicts.
Presenting the summery report of his ministry at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament when the Finance Heads of his ministry were taken up, said the commitment of the labour force in achieving the countrys sustainable development goals should be highly appreciated. It is through their sweat that our economy is built. Hence, my ministrys prime objective is to implement the relevant laws and regulations in order to establish a content and productive labour force in this country.
The Minister said during the recent past, several labour offices were established throughout the country. During last August, the Labour Office complex in Avissawella was vested with the people, built at a cost of Rs. 150 million. Further, the Labour Department Administrative complex built in Jaffna at a cost of Rs. 89.5 million in 2016, was also vested with the people.
Minister Seneviratne noted that the Employees Provident Fund is the second largest social security fund in South Asia and its current value as at June 30, 2017 is Rs. 1,949 billion. This fund, he said, has a membership of 2.6 million. In the first six months of 2017, the Labour Department had collected Rs. 65,339 million as EPF. Further, by sending notices to the organisations that had not paid the EPF, the Labour Department was able to collect Rs. 1.177 million during the first six months of 2017.He noted that during the first ten months of 2017 alone, 2,210 cases had been filed against institutions that had failed to pay EPF contributions. Now, unlike in the past, workers could obtain 30% of their EPF without any hassle or interest being charged. Now this money could be obtained from regional offices as well. If the relevant accurate documents are submitted, the money can be received within three weeks without any issue, the minister said.
Present committee report that probed Salawa Army camp explosion, demands Dinesh
The Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday, called on the Government to present in Parliament the committee report that probed into the Salawa Army Camp explosion.
The MP was speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament, when the Finance Heads of the Disaster Management Ministry were taken up.
The President and the Prime Minister those days promised to present the investigation report in that regard to Parliament. Why dont you make it public How did the incident occur It was not a natural disaster, said the MP.
He also pointed out that compensation payments to people affected by Salawa explosion, Aranayake and Bulathkohupitiya landslides and Kolonnawa floods were yet to be completed. Many have received the compensation, but there are some who have not yet received it, he commented.
He also noted that the undertaking of the Prime Minister to develop the area destroyed by the Salawa armoury explosion as a modern city had not been realised yet.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena replying to the MP said 17,000 families in Kolonnawa received compensation over Rs 80,000, adding that for the first time in history, compensation worth Rs 2 billion was distributed in Kolonnawa. The people will react to it at the upcoming LG elections. You wait and see the results, he commented.
MP Gunawardena speaking on the Ports and Shipping sector, demanded not to proceed with the attempt to hand over the Colombo Port East Terminal to an international Indian company. Dont give it to a foreign company. Keep it with the Ports Authority and develop it, he urged.
Commenting on the Labour Ministry, the MP asked the Government not to proceed with the proposed amendments to the Shop and Office Employees Act and Employment of Women, Young Persons and Children Act stating that those would drastically affect the existing rights and privileges of the workers on working hours, leave, overtime payments, etc. He said the proposed amendments are against the International Labour Convention and violates the Agreements Sri Lanka has signed at the European Commission.
I urge the Labour Minister not to give his consent to these amendments to the laws proposed by the Finance Ministry. Withdraw these amendments, he urged.
Govt wants foreign shipping companies to establish themselves on 100% ownership basis: Rohitha
Joint Opposition MP Rohitha Abeygunawardena alleged that the governments reason for proposing to open the doors for foreign shipping companies to establish themselves in Sri Lanka and lift the 40% cap on ownership was baseless, as currently all leading shipping companies are engaged in business with the country.
The government through its Budget 2018 wants to open the doors for foreign shipping companies to come to Sri Lanka and establish themselves on a 100% ownership basis claiming that this is to encourage foreign investors. However, I would like to ask what are the worlds best known shipping companies that do not come here In fact, all internationally reputed shipping companies do come to Sri Lanka. Allowing foreign shipping agents to come here freely, would only destroy the local shipping industry and $800 million, which is generated through the local shipping sector would be lost to Sri Lanka. These international companies would not keep their earnings here, but would take it out of the country, he said. The MP said this while speaking at the Committee Stage debate of the Budget 2018, when the Finance Heads of Ports and Shipping, Labour and Disaster Management were taken up in Parliament yesterday.
He pointed out that in the past, foreign shipping companies could only hold 40% of shares, while local shipping companies held the majority 60%. During our government too, several proposals were presented to remove the 40% limit and allow foreign shipping companies to own 100% in this country to encourage them to invest here. But we did not allow it, based on the view that local businessmen should be protected.
Govt. terminated proposal to buy cranes for eastern terminal preventing loss of USD 12M
This government terminated an unsolicited proposal to buy cranes for the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port preventing a loss of USD 12 million, said Petroleum Resource Development Minister Arjuna Ranathunga in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation, joining the Committee Stage Debate on the budget proposal under the financial heads of Ports and Shipping Ministry, Labour, Trade Union Relations and Sabaragamuwa Development Ministry and Disaster Management Ministry.
Minister Ranathunga said Ven Madoluwawe Sobitha Thera told him on his appointment as the Ports and Shipping Minister that the corruption in the Ports Authority was similar to the amount of water in the sea. He added that as the Former Ports and Shipping Minister, he prevented corruption as much as possible and recorded a profit. Corrupt trade union activists are attempting control the Port, the Minister said. They had made promotions and removed employees as they wished. We changed that situation. There is also a business mafia. We could prevent them too. The Hambantota Port was a threat to the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.
He also said that the total loan of the Port Authority as at December 31, 2015 was Rs 233.149 billion. In 2016, we were able to earn a profit of Rs 6 billion, Minister Ranathunga said. In 2016, the Colombo Port came amongst the best 23 ports in the world, while the Trincomalee Harbour turned to be profitable. The Galle Port doubled its profits. We increased a 7 percent salary increase.
Minister Ranathunga said that the biggest corruption in the Port was committed at the issuance of licenses to lorries. He added that those MPs who were stung by snakes when asked to declare their assets spoke in the House today on these matters, but as the former Ports and Shipping Minister, he could earn Rs 256.1 million by issuance of the licenses for lorries.
He also asked for the guarantee of job security of the employees at the Hambantota Port. He added that during his period, Prasanna Kalutharage who was a trade union activist was removed due to his involvement in corruption. He had even been punished by Court. But the new management had recruited him again, Minister Ranathunga said. Another person called P Ranathunga who was involved in corruption had been recruited again.
He also said that when this government was elected, there was an unsolicited proposal to buy cranes for the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port. We stopped it as the agreement was to pay more than the actual rates and by that measure we able to earn more than USD 12 million.
Though labour productivity had increased, employers benefit but not employees: Bimal
JVP- MP Bimal Ratnayake said that although labour productivity had increased worldwide, it is only the employers who had benefitted, while the labour force was deprived of these benefits. He said within the past 100 years, labour productivity worldwide had increased by 8%, but the worker had not received the benefit of this progress and their wages have not increased on par with the rate of productivity, nor has the worker gained in terms of the number of work hours. Today in the private sector, especially employees contribute nine hours of work, in addition to the several other hours spent on travelling.
He made this statement, speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament yesterday, when the Finance Heads of Labour and Trade Union Relations were taken up.
Therefore, he said making the working period of eight hours compulsory is unfair and a violation of basic human rights. Unlike in the past, the advancement in technology has only been beneficial to the employer, but not the employee. Today the owners or management of big companies have no clue of how the business is done, but they are the ones who reap the profits, while the highly skilled worker gets no share of the profits and only works hard to increase the profits of the employers. Therefore, the advantage of the advancement in technology should also be afforded to the worker.
He said there is no point in opening up our country for foreign investments that would not come. Citing India as an example, he said, last year foreign investments only reached $46 million. Therefore, he urged the government not to amend the Shop and Office Act in a manner that would deprive the workers of their rights.
According to MP Ratnayake, offering the local labour force as slaves to foreign investors would not bring in foreign investment. We need to have a better strategy to develop this country, he said.
Meanwhile, he asked the Labour Minister if around eight of the labour laws are to be revised with the intervention of USAID. What right does USAID have to talk about Sri Lankas labour sector The US labour sector is a failure in terms of the treatment of the labour force, as 34% of the employed in the US are considered poor. Therefore, when they come here to interfere in our labour market without resolving their own issues, it raises suspicion that they are here to ruin the little we have.Hence, he urged the government not to change the countrys labour laws to satisfy the sinister agendas of other countries.

Ports Minister blasts newspaper advertisements liberalizing shipping industry
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday, took up arms against the publishing of full page newspaper advertisements by the Finance and Mass Media Ministry on liberalizing the shipping industry.
The minister speaking at the Committee Stage debate of Budget 2018 in Parliament when the Finance Heads of his ministry were taken up, reiterated his strong opposition to the budget proposal to fully open up the shipping sector to foreign companies.
For the second time, full page advertisements were published in favour of fully liberalizing the shipping sector. This is public money. Do they have no other topic to highlight We strongly condemn it, said the minister pointing to the newspaper advertisement.
The line ministry is under me. I will not sign that Gazette. Since 1992, foreign ownership of shipping and freight forwarding agencies had been restricted to 40 percent. The balance 60 percent is reserved for local companies. The system continued smoothly since 1992. There are over 500 shipping and freight forwarding agents in Sri Lanka employing about 12,000 people. The SLFP always protected the local businessmen, he said.
The minister said President Mathiripala Sirisena also stands by this position and Minister Rauf Hakeem, who is a former Shipping Minister, spoke in the same line at the Cabinet meeting. Samarasinghe pointed out even though foreign ownership is restricted, the shipping sector has already been fully opened and that any foreign company could even set up their regional headquarters in Sri Lanka.
He criticized the Finance Ministry for not discussing the proposal prior to the Budget with the Line Ministry and those involved in the sector. He said the SLFP has proposed to impose a pre-qualification that full foreign ownership would be allowed only if the foreign companies agree to bring in investment over USD 100 million.
Local businessmen invest money they earn within the country, whereas foreign companies take the money to their respective countries. We stand by the interests of local businessmen, he said.

PROCEEDS FROM GOVT.ASSET SALES FOR DEBT SERVICING - CB GOVERNOR
The Government has taken the decision to earmark all proceeds from the sale or long lease of government assets to be used in debt servicing, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said.
The Central Bank Governor speaking at the Sri Lanka Economic and Investment Conclave, organised by the Federation of Industry and Commerce of China and the Colombo Chamber of Commerce and the Indian Chamber of Commerce at the Kingsbury yesterday, explained the actions taken by the Central Bank and the Government to improve the investment climate for bringing potential investors into the country.
The USD 1.1 billion from the long lease of the Hambantota Port to China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPort), thus he said would be used for debt repayment.
Debt servicing has become a major challenge to the government with 2019 proving to be the test. An estimated USD 5.7 billion of International Sovereign Bonds and syndicated loans are scheduled for settlement over a period of three years, beginning in 2019.
The Sri Lankan government faces the challenge of raising a lot of money but in the last 4-5 months there was no debt maturity, so it provided us with an opportunity collect some money to act as a buffer for next year, explained the Governor.
He assured potential investors that the government was also taking steps to introduce legal frameworks to manage its main source of instability and weakness, the fiscal deficit.
The Fiscal Responsibility Management Act is one such measure which would help them manage their debt and only allow them to deviate in extreme circumstances such as natural disasters,
Even when such an instance happens, they have to set out targets on how they will recover that money,Coomaraswamy said.
In addition to this, the Liability Management Act when brought in is to allow the government to raise money to address the bunching of debt issue which will take place from 2019 onwards.
This raising of capital, according to the Governor will come mostly from China, as he explained that China has now shifted its focus to exporting capital rather than goods though its One Belt One Road initiative.
Sri Lanka fortunately is right in the middle of the Maritime Silk Route and it should take advantage of this massive outflow of capital which is going to take place in the next 10-20 years, he said.
Apart from the Silk Route project, the Governor also noted that the government was working on bilateral trade agreements with China and India. The former would mostly involve in expanding the current FTA to include the exchange of service and technology.
We hope to have agreements signed between China and India in the middle of next year,he said.
If the agreements are signed, the Governor noted that Sri Lanka would be the only country in the world to provide investors with preferential access to Europe, China and India, Central Bank Governor Coomaraswamy said.
Combine this with the location, Sri Lanka is a great place to invest, said the Central Bank Governor.

People displaced by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) 150 Mega Watt Broadlands Hydro-Electricty Project coming up at Polpitiya, Ginigathena, conducted a Satyagraha campaign opposite the project office yesterday, demanding compensation payments without delay.
The Broadlands Project is being built by erecting a bund across the Kelani Ganga at Polpitiya. Thirty three families in Polpitiya have been displaced due to the 7-kilometre tunnel built from Polpitiya to Kalubotenna in Kithulgala to carry water for the turbines. Three houses had subsided during the construction of the tunnel while several other houses had suffered from cracked walls.
As a result, authorities decided to evict 33 families from their houses.
Participants in the satyagraha campaign said the project company provided a sum of Rs. 30,000 to each displaced family to rent out alternative houses, but payments of compensation for lost houses were being deliberately delayed, they said.

Officials from the highest levels of government expressed their continuing support for the cause of the Palestinian state to mark the United Nations day for solidarity with Palestine.The government of Sri Lanka has been consistent in its policy to stand for the inalienable rights of Palestinian people, President Maithripala Sirisena said in a written statement.
In his statement, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Sri Lanka has always been a dear friend to the nation of Palestine, and Ive consistently maintained a strong interest in moving forward.At an event organised by the Sri Lanka Committee for Solidarity with Palestine on Monday, government officials and diplomats gathered at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute to condemn what they called the continued occupation of Palestine by Israel.
For many years, Sri Lanka has worked very, very closely with the aspirations of the Palestinian people, Speaker of the Parliament Karu Jayasuriya said. The Sri Lankan government continues to be a strong advocate for the Palestinian cause, he said.
The Speaker said Sri Lanka would keep representing Palestine on the international stage, so that it may become a sovereign, independent, viable and united state  existing within secure and recognised borders, side by side and at peace with Israel.
I appreciate that here in Sri Lanka you are aware in following the catastrophic situation that is happening in Palestine, said Zuhair Mohammad Hamdallah Zaid, the State of Palestines Ambassador to Sri Lanka.He said he extended our grateful thanks to President Maithripala Sirisena, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the government and the people of Sri Lanka for their active support.

Transfers in the offing for 60,000 police officers
The Police Commission has now paid attention towards granting transfers to nearly 60,000 lower rung police officers ranging from Constables to Sub Inspectors by appointing an official team to study the subject.
It had been long overdue, Police Commission Chairman P. H. Manatunge said.
Already, transfers have been granted to nearly 4,500 policemen and another batch of nearly 4,500 would be given transfers in due course, he added.
Manatunge said steps have also been taken to upgrade and systematise police welfare activities, including the rehabilitation of derelict police barracks.
The Commission received the unstinted support of IGP Pujith Jayasundera in these activities, he said.
