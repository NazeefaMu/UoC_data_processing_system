Public sector basic salary will be Rs. 28,000 by 2020
A lowest wage receiver in the public sector will get a basic salary of Rs. 28,000 by year 2020, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena yesterday said. He said the government since 2015 has increased the basic salary of government employees.
Minister Abeywardena was speaking at the ceremony held at Temple Trees to hand over appointment letters to 4,100 graduates for the posts of Development Officer.
Minister Abeywardena told new development officers to assist the giant development leap that the government is taking now.
In 2015, the basic salary of a public servant in the lowest salary scale was Rs. 12,000. In 2015, we made it Rs. 13,000. Then in 2017, we increased it to Rs. 18,000. In 2018, it will become Rs. 22,000, Minister Abeywardena said.
When you were in the university, you may have supported various political groups. You might have all sorts of political affiliations. That is natural. Now you have become public officers and you are bound to work as a part of a government. You cannot disturb or hinder government operations, he said.
Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the graduates who received appointments as development officers will undergo a proper training. We have expanded the capacity of our training centres to give these officers a proper training. It was difficult for us to absorb all the graduates into the government service. That is why we are doing it in three stages, the Minister said.
Minister Ratnayaka said people need to be creative in finding new ways to generate income. He said the new officers should take the responsibility of the economic development of the country. Now your future is secured with a government job. It is time that you help us create a secured future for the country, he said.

All music today sounds the same
Madonna is unimpressed with the current quality of the music industry.
The pop legend has continuously broken boundaries since the release of her self-titled debut album in 1983, challenging musical conventions through her lyrics, song structures, and sexually-charged visuals.
Never one afraid to experiment, Madonna wishes that more artists today would dare to be different.
Everythings so formulaic, and every song has 20 guest artists on it, and everyone sounds the same, she bemoaned of the music business now during an interview with Vogue Italia.
The 59-year-old is gearing up to unveil a new record that will be released by the end of the year, and went on to explain that she took much inspiration from the Portuguese people shes met since she moved to Lisbon last summer (17), after her 12-year-old son David Banda joined the Benfica soccer team youth academy.
In Alfama, youll hear people singing and playing fado music everywhere, the Material Girl hitmaker shared. There are these weekly sessions called living room sessions which pop up in peoples beautiful homes that are 500 years old, and you walk up the marble steps which are lined with candles into the living room which is also dimly lit with candles. And theres this rolling, very intimate performance happening where people play, they sing, they recite poetry.
Madonna also suggested that, unlike the current crop of popular musicians, the Portuguese perform out of passion as opposed to any financial incentive.
Its like a salon; something which doesnt really exist in many places anymore - people elsewhere say, Call my manager, this is how much I charge, she noted. Im pretty sure in Lisbon people would do these shows and not get paid, they just do them for the love of what they do, and for me, this is glorious and inspiring.

Aquaculture investments to tackle trade deficits: Wijith
Increasing investments in the fisheries sector was the best way to reduce the countrys trade and budget deficits, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Wijith Wijayamuni Zoysa said.
Addressing the Investors Forum for Aquaculture - 2018 held yesterday at the Waters Edge, the Fisheries minister pledged to take necessary measures to acquire more lands for the use of aquaculture investments, adding that aquaculture provided both food and economic gain to the country.
We hope to present a Cabinet paper on the acquisition of lands for aquaculture investments and submit a special proposal to Parliament, seeking funds from next year's Budget, the minister said. If the government provides necessary facilities to increase investments in the fisheries sector, there is no need to obtain loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said.
The minister queried as to how a country could move forward without strengthening its economy.
The Investors Forum for Aquaculture is annually organised by the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA), to provide detailed information on the status of the country's aquaculture, as well as its investment opportunities.
State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, Deputy Minister Ameer Ali, NAQDA Chairman Nuwan Prasantha Madawan Arachchi, Director-General Nimal Chandraratne, as well as local and foreign investors participated in the event.

Bangladesh to increase wheat imports 10pc in 2018/19
Bangladesh will import around 6.5 million tonnes of wheat in the next marketing year, the USDAs local branch in the country estimated, according to a report published on www.agricensus.com Wednesday.
A 10 per cent increase from the branchs estimate last year, the USDA expects around 260,000 tonnes of wheat to be sourced from the US, which fits with official US export figures that have shown an uptick in wheat cargo inspections destined for Bangladesh.
The USDAs official estimate currently put wheat imports at 7.0 million tonnes, up from the official estimate of 6.4 million tonnes last year.
Both the USDA head office and its local branch agree that harvested area will increase by 5.7 per cent to 370,000 hactors, with local production to increase by 6.2 per cent to 1.12 million tonnes due to better yields.
Corn imports will increase by roughly a third to 2.0 million tonnes, where 300,000 tonnes will come from the US.
Increased corn exports to Bangladesh are largely on the back of increased industrial demand in the country.
The USDA noted that farmers in the country were increasingly turning their heads to corn production rather than rice.
[R]ice is treated as a principal crop that farmers feel compelled to produce whether it is profitable or not. Farmers prefer producing corn, as it is somewhat resistant to adverse weather, and has high market demand, the USDA said.
In a bid to support local agriculture, the government of Bangladesh has increased import tariffs on grains.
Import tariffs on starches of wheat, corn, potato, and cassava have been rationalized to 15 percent customs duty and 10 per cent regulatory duty which was only a custom duty in the previous fiscal year, the report said.
In addition to levying import tariffs, heavily subsidised machinery, rebates on electricity and funding at low interest rates for farmers was also a part of the 2018/19 budget.

Bangladesh starts operations at countrys first LNG terminal
Bangladesh has started operations at the countrys first liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, the countrys energy minister said on Monday, following delays related to technical problems and bad weather.
The floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), which arrived in Bangladesh in April to offload its maiden cargo of LNG from Qatar and moor permanently as an import terminal, began operations on Saturday. It was initially expected to start in May.
The start-up will allow Bangladesh to import LNG to offset falling domestic gas production, feeding industrial demand and power generation in a nation where 30 percent go without electricity.
Since its arrival at Moheshkhali, near Coxs Bazar in southeast Bangladesh, in April, bad weather has hampered the FSRUs efforts to dock properly, connect to the import infrastructure and offload its first cargo of Qatari LNG, officials have said.
The FSRU initially started operations last week but had to call a halt due to a leak in an onshore facility, a source said. We have started the process of feeding the gas to the grid,
This is a first step and we are taking more initiatives to meet growing consumption needs and feed the expanding economy.
The Excellence FSRU is operated by privately owned U.S. company Excelerate which had declared force majeure on the project due to the delays. Declaring force majeure absolves a company from responsibility for delays to fulfilling contracts due to circumstances beyond its control.
Asked about the force majeure, an official at state-owned national oil company Petrobangla said everything will be resolved as per the agreement.
The country of 165 million people relies on its gas resources for 70 per cent of energy production but as demand has risen its falling supply has struggled to keep up, prompting it to consider a host of LNG projects.

Bertens shocks No. 1 Halep to win Cincinnati WTA title
CINCINNATI, Sunday: Dutch challenger Kiki Bertens profited from a third-set collapse by Simona Halep to score the biggest win of her career Sunday, beating the world number one 2-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 in the Cincinnati WTA final.
This is the best day of my career, winning on a surface that you didnt really like. Thats a great feeling, Bertens said.
Im just so proud, and its such a great feeling to hold the trophy at the end of the week.
Halep, who claimed the Montreal title a week ago and came into the final on a nine-match winning streak, ran out of reserves and was unable to stop the mounting Bertens momentum.
Ive lost three finals here, but maybe I will able to win one at this tournament because I love to play here, said Halep, who fell to Serena Williams in the 2015 final of the hardcourt US Open tuneup and to Garbine Muguruza in the title match last year.
I had match ball, so I was there, Helep said. I didnt take my chance. In the third set I was empty and I couldnt fight anymore.
The upset took just over two hours and marked the 10th time this season that 17th-ranked Bertens has defeated a top 10 opponent.
It was such a tough match, and after winning that second set I knew, anything is still possible -- just keep on going, said Bertens, who claimed a sixth career WTA title.
Winning a title like this, my first hard court title, and against number one of the world, getting my career high on Monday ... its just coming everything together, I guess, she added.
Bertens saved a Halep match point in the second-set tiebreaker to stay alive. Im a little bit upset because I couldnt manage better today, but thats it. Im like this, and I have to work more, Helep said.
Halep had looked like ending a quick afternoon with a victory after breaking Bertens twice to sweep the first set.
But the 26-year-old Dutchwoman, who had considered retiring last season due to poor results, began to turn the tide in the second as she broke for a 3-1 lead.
Halep got that break back in the eighth game to make it 4-all, and took tighter control in the tiebreaker.
But Bertens won four games in the decider to take a 4-2 lead and quickly seized the set seconds after saving the match point.
HALEP EXHAUSTED
Halep seriously faded in the final set, going down two breaks to trail 1-4.
Bertens kept up the pressure and advanced with a winner on her first match point, posting her second career win over Hale six years after beating her for the first time.
The depleted Halep is still entered as top seed in the upcoming WTA tournament in New Haven, which ends just two days prior to the start of the US Open in New York.
While not specifying if she will actually play, Halep said she would travel to Connecticut on Monday.
For sure I need a little bit of rest because Im exhausted. But also I take the positive from these two weeks, she added. Its a great confidence (builder), and Im looking forward actually for the next one to be better on court.  AFP

Minister Senaratne said the CAPD solution will be provided first to kidney patients in the North Central Province under an investment project. The Cabinet approval is to be obtained to implement the project.
In the past, only one company imported the CAPD solution. Therefore, Sri Lanka experienced a shortage as a result. Now, two more companies have registered to import the solution, the minister said.
Countries, including Sri Lanka, will have to ban Glyphosate soon, following a court decision in the US.
There is a danger for Sri Lankan tea in the world market because the use of Glyphosate in tea plantations is cancerous, he said.

Spare us the ordeal of clinical waste
There were reports that clinical waste from other countries are directed towards Sri Lankan beaches. These clinical waste were found in Puttalam, Vadamarachchi, Thondaimanaru and other parts of the Jaffna District.
Maritime Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) is taking action to have discussions with relevant High Commissions at a diplomatic level to urge the relevant countries to prevent clinical waste being dumped in the ocean.
It was reported that some of the above waste consisted of cosmetic bottles, food wrappers, multivitamin bottles and plastic bottles manufactured in Sri Lanka. They are taking action to incinerate these waste items.
Clinical waste is any waste which consists wholly or partly of human or animal tissue, blood or other body fluids, excretions, drugs or other pharmaceutical products, swabs or dressings, syringes, needles or other sharp instruments, being waste which unless rendered may prove hazardous to any person coming into contact with it.
Professionals are specially trained and equipped for regular collection and handling of clinical waste.
Autoclave systems are installed in hospitals for the disposal of clinical waste. Autoclave can sterilize solids, liquids, hollows and instruments of various shapes and sizes. A very basic autoclave is similar to a pressure cooker.
Due to the potential risks associated with the improper handling of clinical waste, its proper management and disposal is vital.
It is very important for all of us to be aware of the dangers of clinical waste and how to manage it in a safe way.

The Ceylon Motor Traders Association (CMTA) in a communique sates that it was not in favour of creating competition in vehicle procurement.
The statement said the association has noticed numerous press articles lobbying for Government tenders to be opened to importers of used cars or non brand new vehicle importers.
Government tenders are effectively sales agreements between the manufactures of motor vehicles and the Government of Sri Lanka. The local agent is often not a party to this contract. The manufacture, nominates their local agent to act on their behalf and carry out pre delivery inspections and give warranty support etc. This procurement process is internationally accepted.
By the Government dealing with the manufacture, they are assured of not only the best price, but the most suitable vehicle for the conditions of the country of operation. Further, the vehicles are supported by manufacturers warranty.
The CMTA expressed confidence that the Government of Sri Lanka will continue to adopt internationally accepted practices and not deviate from their present procurement procedures for motor vehicles.
CMTA was established in 1920, affiliated to the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and represents the agents of all major automotive manufactures in the world.

DHADAK cobwelebs of TRUTHS
The much speculated entrance of former Bollywood Superstar  the late Sridevis daughter Janhvi Kapoors film Dhadak may not be a magnum opus but it does not fail to captivate hearts due it its vibe for innocence and freshness.
The film also brings one-film-old Ishaan Khatter to the limelight as Janhvis love interest. Ishaan had proven his potentials as an actor in Beyond the Clouds and he is able to highlight his acting talents further through Dhadak.
Originally inspired by Nagraj Manjules Sairat the story goes along the stereotype Bollywood storyline of boy meets girl, love blossoms and they have to be on the run to shield their love from the cruel world. However it takes a novel twist once the young couple has to settle down in an apartment with minimal facilities and have to work hard to make a living. Unlike Ishaans Madhukar, Janhvis Parthavi is from the elite class and used to having luxuries delivered to her doorstep. However unlike the typical spoilt brat, she is down to earth and though she faces many difficulties which are alien to her, she suffers silently but manages to win against the odds.
Though Parthavi and Madhukar encounter several instances in which they misunderstand each other, they manage to get over these instances and act like mature adults. They manage to save up for a decent living, have a child and even get promoted for their hard work. However unlike Madhukar, Parthavi still has an innocent outlook towards the world. She pines for her family and believes that all is forgotten and forgiven as time lapses. She does not heed Madhukars words when he says that he does not trust them and allows her bother and his friends to visit them in their housewarming ceremony to their new home. However she has to pay a bitter price for her naive quality. Shashank Khaitan has handled the Dhadak storyline in the best possible manner. He has worked upon its strengths like playing upon the innocence of the lovers and making the best of the fresh pairing. This is his third film and there are instances which we can reflect back to his previous creations.
Touching upon the deep rooted prejudices in life Dhadak brings forth several realities in life which has been camouflaged by wealth and status.
On the downside there are a few instances in which some scenes look unbelievable. For instance though the young couple is forced to work and live in situations while trying to make ends meet, they still manage to look their best.
Taking performances into consideration Ishaan seems like a beacon of hope for Bollywood. He displays the zest of a star in the making with his dramatic performances and expressive eyes. Janhvi looks beautiful and playful in the scenes. She has inherited her mothers charm as a Bollywood heroine.
However the greatest strength of the film is probably in its climax. It is not only heart wrenching but also leaves many questions in the viewers minds as it leaves a big question mark towards the end of the story.

Djokovic wins Cincy title to complete Masters matched set
CINCINNATI, Monday: Novak Djokovic ended a career-long jinx, lifting the trophy in Cincinnati at last to complete a matched set of Masters 1000 titles.
Djokovic, who came up empty in five prior Cincinnati finals, defeated seven-time winner Roger Federer 6-4, 6-4 in the final.
The former world number one became the first man to win all nine of the ATPs Masters 1000 events in the elite series current configuration.
Federer, meanwhile, lost a final in the hardcourt US Open tuneup for the first time.
I played five finals (here) before, and most of those finals I lost to this great man, Roger ... thank you for letting me win here once in Cincinnati, Djokovic joked.
This is a dream come true, Djokovic said. I finally won Cincinnati after six finals, some against the greatest ever, Roger.
Federer, a 20-time Grand Slam winner, said his game wasnt sharp -- but he didnt want to take anything away from Djokovics achievement.
Novak is a great champion, Federer said. This is about him making history.
Federers streak of 100 straight unbroken service games in Cincy was ended by Djokovic in the seventh game of the first set.
The 37-year-old Swiss had been aiming for a 99th career trophy, but was unable to get over the line due in part to four double-faults at the most inopportune of times, but he said his return game was also lacking.
It was definitely not my best day on the return - it was just awful, Federer said. Missing every second serve on the forehand side, I dont know what that was about.
But I dont even want to look for reasons why it happened, he added. Novak totally deserved to win today. This (effort) was not good enough.
Good week, but Im happy its over and I need to rest, added Federer, his eye on the US Open starting in New York in eight days.
Djokovic claimed the opening set in 37 minutes and came back from an early break in the second to overhaul his longtime rival as they played for the 46th time.
WONDERFUL FEELING
The Serb now leads Federer 24-22 and has won their last three encounters.
The pair had not played since the 2016 Australian Open semi-finals more than two and a half years ago.
Wimbledon champion Djokovic claimed his Masters record on his first match point and now heads to the US Open as a title favorite after a string of sub-par seasons and an elbow injury which required surgery.
Its a wonderful feeling. its been a couple of tough months for me with an injury and then winning Wimbledon and Cincinnati, Djokovic said.
Federer started the match with three aces in the opening game, then added a pair of love games for a 3-2 lead.
But it began to unravel as the Swiss double-faulted to yield a break point, dropping serve as Djokovic moved ahead 4-3.
Djokovic took advantage for a 5-3 lead and closed out the set after 37 minutes.
Federer broke for a 2-0 lead in the second set but gave the break back immediately as he double faulted to give Djokovic a break point which the Serb promptly converted.
Djokovic broke again to lead 4-3, and after Federer held to close the gap to 4-5 Djokovic ended the afternoon in the next game on his first match point.

Eid  ul  Azha: Opportunity to build social and communal harmony
Muslims all over the world will celebrate Eid Ul- Azha festival on August 22. According to the Islamic tradition, there are two festivals observed by Muslims every year: Eid-ul-Fitr and Eid - ul  Azha. Eid - ul  Fitr is celebrated at the end of the month of Ramazan just after completing a month of continuous fasting and Eid - ul  Azha is observed in the month of Haj. Ramazan and Dhul Hajj are the Arabic names of the months in the Muslim calendar. Eid - ul - Azha or Haj festival, also known as the Festival of Sacrifice is celebrated in the month of Dhul-Haj.
The festival remembers when Almighty Allah (SWT) tested the faith of the Prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) ordering him to sacrifice his only son Ismail (PBUH) as an act of obedience. Just as Ibrahim (PBUH) was about to sacrifice his son, Allah (SWT) stopped him and gave him a sheep through angel Gibrael (PBUH) to sacrifice instead. A version of this story also in the Holy Bible (Old Testament), where Ibrahim (PBUH) is known as Abraham.
Basically, both festivals are commonly known as Eid among other communities. Eid usually starts with Muslims going to the mosque for prayers, dressed in their best clothes, and praised for Almighty Allah (SWT) for all the blessings they have received.
And then it is also a time they visit family and friends as well as meet their neighbours whether they are Muslims or non-Muslims to exchange good wishes and spending some time with them sharing happiness offering with meals and sweets.
Harmony among the communities
Eid is a Muslim festival. But, Muslims like to share Eid with other communities live in a society and in a neighbourhood. Therefore, Eid has a social connotation to build a close relationship with the communities in other faiths. Sri Lanka is a multicultural and multi-religious country in the region. Therefore, Muslims meet not only the people in their faith, also the neighbours of other denominations with their colleagues at work or in business to share Eid celebrations bonding each other without any religious and cultural barriers. This is what we need in Sri Lanka to make harmony among the communities. Muslims invite their neighbours and friends to spend some time with them. In this sense, Eid promotes social harmony with other communities. So it is a time to share the happiness of Eid with people of other religions meeting them and sharing the luscious food and sweets.
Holy Quran teaches us how to treat the people of other faiths with dignity and how to respect other religions and the neighbours no matter whether they are Muslims or Non-Muslims. There are lots of examples and authentic incidents from the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his teachings on social and communal harmony to respect other religions and faiths with dignity.
Spirit of sharing and caring
The Prophet Muhammad said, You are not a believer until you love for your brother what you love for yourself (Sahih Bukahri). In his voluminous commentary, Shihab Al Deen Qastallani (d.851H) writes that the word brother is inclusive of non-Muslims as well as Muslims. According to Prophet Muhammads teaching, he said: show mercy towards all on this earth, the one who is above the heavens will bestow mercy on you (Shih Bukhari). Therefore, the Holy Quran describes Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as a source of mercy to all creation (21:108).
Its a celebration that should plant in our heart the spirit of sharing and caring about the people in other societies as well. Its a festival to celebrate with the whole community regardless of faith and also to come together and celebrate the fabric of humanity. Happiness, harmony and respect for all. To encourage cohesion. Eid celebrations give the Muslims an opportunity to bond with each other, share happiness, make memories and most importantly make communal harmony when living in a vibrant multicultural society like Sri Lanka.

Fashioning future texture
At the University of Moratuwas Fashioning the Future event, fashion industry insiders looked ahead to a bittersweet future. Serious discussions of environmental degradation at the hands of mass waste were lightened by the dazzling, futuristic possibilities of technological advancement.
Speakers from the University warned of incipient environmental devastation evinced by ever escalating natural disasters and a rising global temperature. As Professor Ajith de Alwis of the Chemical and Process Department at Moratuwa put it, in talk aptly named the Catwalk Beyond 400 PPM, extreme events are not extreme anymore, they are too frequent.
Professor de Alwis recounted the history of consumerism and the toxic idea that heaven is what one can buy, which spread across industrialized societies in the mid 20th century. But such practices, he cautioned, have let to consumption that has degraded our environment. He said businesses must Eco-innovate or perish, a motto that is not just for companies but for the rest of the world as well.While environmental risks left a sombre tone audience, the potential of technology offered some optimism.
Lakdas D Fernando, Professor Emeritus at the University of Moratuwa, called the gradual automation of the machine floor, the biggest change the fashion industry has seen since the dawn of large scale manufacturing. A wind of change is blowing through all business and all industries, he said stressing the importance of rising to the coming challenges, to weather the storm, one has face it and run with the wind.
Patagonia, an outerwear company, offered insight into its own eco-friendly practices with a presentation from their representative in Sri Lanka, Hamdoon Zackaria. Zackaria enumerated the ways in which patagonia has reduced its waste and committed to sustainable, fair trade practices The event also featured a presentation from Nike representative, Michael Steen who offered tall tales of a high-tech superstore in West Hollywood, USA, where a customer can place orders for pick-up on a smartphone and walk out of the store with their purchase and without any physical payment process. Steen emphasized the importance of digital savviness in the age of technology and highlighted the growth of customized design in the industry.
Presentations were followed by the University of Moratuwas graduation fashion show and an exhibition of student designs held at JDA Perera Gallery.

First look  at live-action  version of  Mulan
Disney has unveiled the first image from its much-anticipated live-action Mulan film, showing Liu Yifei, also known as Crystal Liu, in the starring role.
Production has started on the remake of the 1998 animated film and will take place in China and New Zealand.
Finding an actress to play Mulan, a young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to stop her father from joining the military, involved interviewing nearly 1,000 candidates across five candidates for the role.
The story of the legendary warrior is one of Chinas most popular folktales, and is still a part of the curriculum in Chinese schools today.
Disney called the story of Mulan an epic adventure with the 1998 version- which was nominated for an Oscar - having gained cult status
Mulan is the epic adventure of a fearless young woman who masquerades as a man in order to fight Northern Invaders attacking China, the film studio said.
The eldest daughter of an honoured warrior, Hua Mulan is spirited, determined and quick on her feet. When the emperor issues a decree that one man per family must serve in the Imperial Army, she steps in to take the place of her ailing father as Hua Jun, becoming one of Chinas greatest warriors ever.
Among other actors cast in the film are Jet Li, Donnie Yen, Cheng Pei-pei and Tzi Ma. Chris Bender, Jason Reed, and Jake Weiner are producers for the film; Mulans executive producers include Barrie M. Osborne, Tim Coddington and Bill Kong.
The live-action movie will premiere in theatres March 27, 2020.

Former Speaker speaks out against rising prices
Former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa said the people find it impossible to keep their home fires burning and live under trying circumstances due to the skyrocketing prices of consumer items.
He was addressing a gathering of SLFPers at Medamulana in Weeraketiya, recently.
He said the price of pepper and cinnamon had come down to a minimum. Therefore, pepper and cinnamon cultivators are left high and dry. The workplaces that were busy during the previous regime have closed down. The people previously earned their daily bread by engaging in mega development projects. Yet, there is no such thing to engage in now, he said. The former Speaker added that they still remember how the 1986 Mulkirigala election was held. Then the ballot boxes were filled with fake votes. Some ballot boxes were set on fire. That was how the Mulkirigala electorate was won by the UNP.
He said the people now urge for an election to topple this government.
He added that in 1956, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike left the UNP. Thereafter, D. A. Rajapaksa became the Member of Parliament for the Beliatta electorate in 1952. The previous government was committed to protect and safeguard the countrys unity, territorial integrity, and sovereignty.
Yet, present-day rulers are giving away the wealth and resources of the country to foreigners, he said.

General Sales Agents appointed without following proper procedures
It was disclosed at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the alleged frauds at SriLankan Airlines that the airline had appointed General Sales Agents in foreign countries without following proper procedures.
SriLankan Airlines Technical Services Manager Shiromi Cooray giving evidence before the Presidential Commission yesterday said that these sales agents were granted large amounts of money as commissions above the approved rates.
She added that the sales agents were appointed in contravention of the companys handbook.
Shiromi Cooray when queried by State Counsel Chatura Gunathilake on the appointment of General Sales Agents to the Seychelles, Dubai, Thailand and Singapore said these agents were appointed to foreign countries to issue air tickets for the passengers who are using direct flights. She added that the company called for applications from qualified candidates to recruit General Sales Agents by publishing paper advertisement and ads on the Airlines official website.
She informed the Commission this recruitment process was never in practice after 2009. Cooray added that this system was again in force after 2015.

Geoff Wijesinghe
I always wanted to interview him and at last I got the opportunity and it was a pleasure to go to the Millenium City to meet the grand old man himself. It was a pity that he was bed ridden due to a recent hip operation, in spite of the discomfort he was going through he was game enough to oblige me.
Geoff Wijesinghe is a doyen amongst the scribes who has shown the way to many and not the least to one who is going great guns at the Daily News at present. It was a pity that I did not have that opportunity since writing came to me by accident rather than design. It was a pleasure to watch burly old Geoff rambling along.
He grew up in Edward Lane Colpetty and they had lane matches which were interesting and there were some who later on went to play college cricket mostly for Royal.This was in the 1940s. They had no pads but played with a leather ball, they were embryonic days of cricket stated Geoff. They used to hop onto the bikes and watch school and clubs games and he was fascinated by the SSCS nice tall trees which dotted the surrounds of the grounds, which reminisced Geoff of London, England. He was delighted by the contrasting styles of batting by Sargo Jayawickrema and F.C. de Saram, the former with his thundering off, on and straight drives and the latter with his workmanlike style of onside play although he could shuffle across and play well on the onside. Their opponents were Tamil Union and Sathasivam was picturesque and stylish to watch with his cap set at a rakish angle. There were pace bowler Fairly Dalpathado, Mahesh Rodrigo and several others, they were a nice crowd, they watched in awe and imbibed a lot of knowledge without realizing. Once the war was over Geoff recalled that he watched fascinated by M.O. Gunaratne who scored a century and bagged 10 wickets. He was the best leg spinner ever produced by Sri Lanka like Clarrie Grimmet. Geoff noted that Lucien de Zoysa used to twist and turn and bowl straight balls. He got a good harvest of wickets at club level due to batsmen being bamboozled playing for turn and getting lbw.
During a Royal-Thomian old boys match at CCC Lucien opened batting and took it so seriously he started taking short singles and collapsed and had to be taken to hospital. In that same match Geoff bumped into late Sirimavo Bandaranaike coming up the stairs at the CCC and cheekily asked her when she was going to bat and she had said, I am too old for that men and Geoff was pleasantly surprised. Late H.I Fernando was a talented cricketer who captained Prince of Wales, Moratuwa and played for Ceylon. He was a colorful character who got caught to mischief regarding some dud notes.Geoff recalled that he went off balance and tried to live beyond his means.
At the Royal-Thomian 1952, Royal were all out 90 odd and S Thomas were 70 for 6 when Geoff went into bat and the adrenalin flowed. The first 4 balls went for 4 fours the first three through the covers and next a hook for 6 it was a leg spinner who was at the receiving end. At the next match P.I. was the captain and it was 13 for 3 when Geoff went in and at 14 for 4 when P.I. came in he told, lets teach these bloody Royalist a lesson. When he got out the score stood at 201. P.I. got a hundred and Geoff 60 odd, a fine partnership of 185 a record held for 50 years.
Geoff married early at 26 in 1962 and had to work in the Daily Mirror as a stringer when he was working as a playground instructor. The Daily Mirror was a tabloid then.
When asked about todays scribes Geoff mentioned that they try to tell them what the answer should and also they are not humble and pretended to know everything. Geoff use to put a photo of Christ in front of his office desk, and he stated that keeps his feet on the ground. He is a positive thinker and stated that one should be true to yourself which will make one a leader.
When the writer requested to comment on the state of affairs of Sri Lanka cricket, Geoff pointed out that the bane of Sri Lanka cricket was when Asanka Gurusinha was brought back into the fold after more than a decade hibernating in Australia. Geoff stated that Graham Ford and Gurusinha never saw eye to eye and unfortunately Ford decided to leave and then captain Mathews too suffered as a consequence.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 40 :
Going beyond a marketing plan for soaring profits
Developing and implementing a marketing plan is not enough to reach marketing objectives. To maximize the return on a marketing plan, there need to be controls in place to monitor the plans progress. As a marketing plan moves along, the controls are constantly analysed to determine how the plans actual performance compares to the projections.
Any changes that need to be made are done based on the analysis of marketing controls. Understanding what the controls in a marketing plan are will help you develop effective performance measurement indicators
Marketing control is a four-step process: -
1. Decide your marketing objectives and performance standards
2. Regularly compare results against standards
3. Do necessary corrections and alteration
4. Follow-up at regular intervals
Let us study each of them in little depth.
Marketing objectives and performance standards
A Marketing objective is a standard which is used to measure the performance of the ream members. Such Standards may be of two types, Quantitative Standards and Qualitative Standards.
Quantitative Standard can be easily defined and measured. For e.g. number of products, number of customers, cost, net profit, time limits, etc. Qualitative Standard cannot be easily defined and measured. For e.g. measurement of morale, measurement of job satisfaction, measurement of effect of a training program, advertisement program, etc. However, today there are many new techniques for measuring qualitative standards.
Responsibilities
Whatever the standards adapted, they should be easily understood by both managers and team members. The responsibility of each individual should also be clearly defined.
(1) After establishing the standards, the team members should be provided with all the resources for performing the job. They should be properly directed and motivated to perform the job. After each job (or at regular intervals) their performance should be carefully measured.
(2) The actual performances of each person should be compared with established standards, and extract the deviations. They can either be positive or negative. Positive Deviation means that the actual performances are better than the established standards. Positive deviations should be appreciated. The management should pay special attention to the negative deviation. They should find out the causes. Generally, minor (small) deviations are ignored. However, continuing major deviations should be immediately addressed and reported to the higher management.
(3) The managers should take steps to correct these negative deviations by taking corrective actions. Corrective action may include, providing better motivation, giving better training, using better resources, etc. The management should monitor the progress. This follow-up is done to find out whether the corrective actions are taken properly. It also finds out whether the deviations and their causes are removed.
(4) If the corrective action is not effective, higher management need to be alerted for advice.
Measures
Several measures may be taken in effecting marketing control in relation to the marketing plan, including (1) sales analysis, (2) market share analysis, (3) expenses to sales ratios, (4) attitude tracking, (5) profitability and efficiency.
Sales analysis
Actual sales can be compared to sales targets and budgets and an analysis of any variance between the two would be carefully examined. Say, for example, that the managing director of the ABC Canning Company is told by the marketing manager that sales are up by 10% by units on the target and that revenues are five percent above budget, this would be cause for celebration. Or would it Before approving funds for celebration, the managing director would wish to look at these figures a little more analytically.
Further analysis will reveal that although sales have exceeded expectations, the planned price was not achieved and so the product made a lower contribution than expected. Whilst the Canning Company recorded an increase in unit sales of ten percent, the market as a whole was twenty percent above target. Seen in this light, there is more cause for concern than for celebration.
This approach to sales analysis can be extended to specific products, market segments and/or sales areas, etc. to evaluate the profit contributions of each and to identify those that were poor performers.
Market share analysis
A market share analysis compares the status of a business with competitors in its sales region. There are many types of information collected for this type of analysis, including the names of competitors, indicators of market size, and the study of past and projected market growth. A typical goal of a market share analysis is to determine the portion of market share that the business will target.
An important task of a market share analysis is to determine the value of market share for the type of business being examined. In order to find this value, several factors must be determined. This includes the size of the industrys market and what kinds of products are sold. The overall size of the market can be determined by revenue and sales volume.
Once the size of the market is known, the next step of a market share analysis is to determine what percentage each business holds. If a small number of businesses makes a high percentage of sales, then the region has a highly concentrated marketed. When sales are more evenly distributed across several different businesses, then the market is fragmented. The primary purpose of this exercise is to determine the top competitors in the field.
An analysis of both the most and least successful competitors in the market can be another important factor of market share analysis. By understanding why one business is succeeding while another is struggling, a company can devise a sound strategy for expanding the business. This includes avoiding the missteps of smaller businesses and learning from the victories and mistakes of the larger businesses.
A market share analysis will show not only the overall percentage a business holds in the market, but also a more detailed analysis of its status in different areas. For example, a business may have a fairly low market share overall, but dominate in the sales of a particular product. Understanding this aspect of market share can help a company to strategize future product development, whether it is to continue to grow a strong sector or to compete more strongly in other areas.
Another aspect of market share analysis is the study of market growth. By anticipating how market demand and the overall economy are expected to change in the next few years, a business can create a growth strategy.

In todays business and economic climate, one of the key metrics for determining the effectiveness of Marketing Management function should be its ability to improve the ratio of marketing expenses to revenue. Let us call it MEPR.
Calculating the MEPR is extremely easy; just divide total marketing spending by total revenue from sales. Exclude any revenue thats not from sales activity, such as royalty earnings or interest on savings. Marketing spending includes all costs of sales and marketing, including advertising, sales staff, marketing materials including your website, marketing consultants and so on.
If your business relies heavily on sales staff you can subdivide the MEPR to get a more granular view. For instance, if you know that with your current advertising budget your sales team gets 500 leads per month, and you make one sale per every 20 leads, you can see that your current marketing budget results in 25 sales per month.
This metric is important to track both during periods of high business growth as well as during tougher economic times when containing costs without disrupting revenue streams is an imperative. It could also be used to help effectively manage the sales and marketing organizations.
Marketing expense analysis
Businesses must continually assess the appropriate levels of marketing expenses based on their return on investment and industry standards. Marketing expenses should be evaluated and measured across common expense to sales ratios to determine their effectiveness. For example, business owners can calculate ratios such as advertising to sales ratio, sales promotion to sales ratio, and sales force cost to sales ratio etc. By keeping a close eye on these ratios and variations over time and comparing them with industry benchmarks, business owners can confirm they are not overspending on marketing costs
Appropriate steps
By demanding continuous improvements in the MEPR, top management can foster a corporate culture that is committed to getting the most out of their sales and marketing investments, regardless of the competitive climate. Furthermore, a focus on the MEPR can instil a high degree of agility in the sales and marketing organization, enabling it to react quickly to rapid competitive manoeuvres or new unforeseen opportunities.
Before a company can decide the steps to take to improve the MEPR, they need to determine how sales and marketing must perform against overall business objectives and strategies. In other words, companies need purpose to determine the focus of MEPR actions.
Is the company more focused on growing top-line revenue or reducing costs Focusing on either segment can increase productivity. What is the companys mix of specialty versus commodity products, and how does that mix reflect the needs of the market How are these conditions likely to change, and given those changes where does the company directionally want to move its business The answers to these questions can help determine the MEPR agenda.
Significance
Spending more on marketing does not guarantee more sales, but it does generally have a strong influence. Since this correlation is hard to predict, using a marketing to revenue ratio to track the trends in your business over time is a critical means of setting your budget. For example, if you know that Rs.1.0 million in marketing results in revenue of Rs. 10.0 Million, but Rs. 2.0 million only results in sales of Rs. 13.5 million, your current product line might not see a strong benefit from a budget over Rs. 1.0 million.

The good, true and beautiful
When she set foot in the Moorfields Eye Hospital, she was only eight. Her battle has already begun in earnest. Rhiannon Willis had lost her sight in one eye and her other eye was already making her vision incoherence worse. She was struck by all kinds of eyesore conditions: glaucoma, cataracts and severe inflammation. It was 2001 when she was entrusted to Professor Peng Khaw.
The wait was long and boring to a suffocating extent. But Rhiannon did not lose faith in Professor Khaw. The eye specialist elaborated her condition in the laypersons language. And the professor lived up to her expectations. The vision was so clear; so sharp with so many colours, Rhiannon expressed her joy later.
When Dr Peng Khaws team restored the eyesight Rhiannon had lost in early childhood, she saw her mother for the first time in four years. In 2007, Rhiannon laid the foundation stone of the Richard Desmond Childrens Eye Centre. The newly built centre offered a more home-like mood to its visitors. The computer games and many other fantastic play areas were reserved for children of any age. The parents also found joy in the surrounding. The aim was clear: to not to feel as if you are in a clinic anymore.
Where does the key to this cheerfulness lie Doctors Of course, the answer is yes. And yet, that very joy seems a distant hypothesis if not for the architect of the building.
Meet Sunand Prasad, the Past President of Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) who arrived in Sri Lanka recently to grace the first Annual General Meeting of RIBA Sri Lankan Branch.
In an interview with the Guardian, Sunand Prasad has raised the high point in his career: whenever a client says a building makes them love going to work. That seems the core point in all the buildings he has designed (Wimbledon Studios, Rushton Street Surgery, the Sibson building and Rockhampton Library among them). As Prasad came to terms with the Moorfields motto  let there be light  he knew it needs to be materialised with the elements of the playful intervention. The emotional aspect, Prasad emphasises, is the most important element especially in a childrens hospital.
That led to the most noted feature of the building: its exterior lighting resembling the flock of birds. The light system comes alive as dusk falls in London. With a grin, Prasad notes how the Londoners would make a fuss if the buildings lights are not switched on.
In architecture, like in all other operative arts, the end must direct the operation. The end is to build well. The well-building could be achieved with three gradual steps: commodities, firmness and delight. With this philosophy, the Indian-born British architect ventures into an area where an average architect is not really at home with. It is the Vedic philosophy that innovates three simple, yet meaningful, terms: Satyam, Shivam and Sundaram.
Buildings, in other words, need to be beautiful. The commodity stands for the quality of the object. Its the judgement you make. The three words are essential as it is somehow complete, Prasad elaborates, adding that Sundaram is beautiful in the Vedic philosophy. Upon interpreting the Vedic lines, Prasad explained how shocked he was by the Shivam part. It stands for the godliness. In terms of time and geography, it brings out the essential values. It stands for a buildings functionalism, Prasad explains.
Beauty just doesnt come, Prasad says, citing the bicycle, one of the most simple machines on earth. If the good, the true and beautiful are extremely serviceable to a carbon-free environment, then the best example is a bicycle, Prasad noted referring to the utilitarianism of this light transport mode. What makes cycle more advantageous over a car If you pose that question to Prasad, you will get the obvious answer: a car burns money and makes you fat, whereas a cycle burns your fat and saves the money. The modern architect should keep that in mind when they design a new building.
Then he takes the example of a chair. Seemingly much simple, it serves the most essential requirement: sitting. Simplification is done with minimalism. It is the ultimate way of getting out the mass amount of engineering. Underneath a simple chair is a lot of engineering. This is essential for the way of construction. Citing Ajanta Caves, Sunand Prasad emphasised on the minimalism yet with intricate designs. It evokes the memories of timber construction of a bygone time. People built these some time back and they become symbols later in the digital period.
To elaborate on the simplicity, Sunand Prasad extracted Maslows hierarchy of needs. On top of the pyramid is self-actualisation which includes morality, creativity, spontaneity, problem-solving, lack of prejudice and acceptance of facts. Then comes the esteem which includes self-esteem, confidence, achievement, respect of others and respect by others. This is followed by love or belonging where friendship, family and sexual intimacy are embedded. That leads to safety which is the security of body, employment, resources, morality, family and health. The last step of the pyramid is the most important one. It is the physiological requirement which means breathing, food, water, sex and excreting. Without this bottom step, you cannot reach for the topmost step which is self-actualisation.
This was Prasads model in designing most noted buildings. When he designed the Rushton Street Surgery, for instance, he gave priority to the patients perspective. In such an environment it is easy for the doctors to make decisions while the same stands more therapeutic for the patient occupants.
In designing the Rockhampton Library, Prasad followed the Alberto Manguel theory. It is Alberto Manguel who defined an ideal library. An ideal library is meant for one particular reader. Every reader must feel that he or she is the chosen one.
It is a vanishing memory with the advent of ebooks. But still, the memories of the libraries are important, Prasad says.
The new building of QEII hospital which replaced the old one three years ago was quite a tough job for Prasad. There were essential divisions such as departments, front doors, hallways.
These are like petals. You need to know how to assemble it into making one flower. The Central Garden decreases the stress level. The garden city was made especially to make the hospital stress free for the visitors, especially the children. It ensures proper ventilation as well, Prasad explains.
The Wimbledon Studios was built with extreme attention to the zero-carbon attitude. One section collects rains while another generates electricity from sunlight. Built in timber the building is extremely sustainable.
The Sibson building is another example bold and simple designed for the University of Kent. Instead of having three buildings in separate areas, Prasad merged the three into one.
Then the insiders can interact and go into each others buildings without much difficulty. Two buildings are connected to the centre building. People are connected. I was particularly excited by this project. It is the unexpected use of the landscape. Tranquillity is granted with the ground area allocated to the cafeteria, Prasad notes.
It is the beautiful, good and true in the ultimate sense. The beautiful should be in a qualitative sense. It raises spirits, enhances the image and new knowledge. The good is both qualitative and quantitative which means adaptability, sense of security and landscape. The true is essentially quantitative which means adequacy of structure, space and light. All this could be applied to a building.
All at once means that architecture has the special ability to express the transcendental, to enable people individually and collectively to flourish and to accommodate the mundane, all at once. An architects work is focused on the search for this all at once, this simultaneity, none at the expense of another.

Government generated 700,000 income sources by end 2017 - PM
By the end of 2017, the government has generated 700,000 income sources including 430,000 direct employments, self-employments and foreign workers, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister also said that during the two year span from 2015 to 2017, the number of employees receiving pension or EPF schemes have increased from 7.8 million to 8.2 million.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that the governments target is to decrease the total debt of the country to 60% of the Gross Domestic Product by 2025.
The Premier made these observations speaking at the ceremony held to handover government appointments to 4,100 graduates as development officers, under the graduate scheme.
The ceremony was held at Temple Trees last evening.
Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera, UNP MPs Hesha Vithana and MP Kavinda Jayawardena also participated in the event. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe observed that the present government had to take numerous unpopular decisions owing to the debt ridden country that it had to shoulder in 2015.
We had to take some tough decisions. We were repeatedly attacked and blamed or taking these decisions. There comes a time in life when we have to take difficult decisions and suffer the repercussions. As a government, we took those decisions and in return we had to undergo an election loss. However, we cannot go ahead without forming a strong foundation upon which we can develop the economy, he said.
The Premier also observed that many Asian countries, including Bangladesh, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam are economically advanced while Sri Lanka remain in the same position for decades.
He also said that the young generation of the country deserves such an advanced development in Sri Lanka as well. At the beginning, the employment opportunities were less. We are absorbing graduates into public service as development officers in three stages. Some may blame us, but I dont want to recruit all the graduates and create a situation where they even wont have a chair to sit at the office they are to work. If we did so, it would have been a disrespected to your qualifications, the Prime Minister said.
Addressing the new appointees, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further said; Now we are ready to go that distance. When we took over this government in 2015, it was like a dilapidated vehicle. We had to repair it. We painted it in both green and blue. Now it is ready to take us forward, slowly, but surely. In future, we can accelerate our journey. You are also now a part of this journey. I hope you will give your best and be dedicated to this country.
Premier Wickremesinghe also requested the new development officers who will be attached to the Home Affairs Ministry to provide their service to the Gamperaliya rural development project.
Ministers Sagala Ratnayaka and Vajira Abeywardena also spoke.

Ignoring railway crossing signals to cost drivers Rs.25,000
A Rs.25,000 fine will be imposed on errant drivers who ignore railway level crossing signals, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said yesterday.
The minister said the relevant laws to impose a fine of Rs.25,000 on errant drivers who violate railway crossing signals have been already drafted and these will come into effect shortly.
The Transport Ministry has already embarked on a project to erect new electrical signal units and warning bells at a cost of US $6.4 million at vulnerable railway crossings across the country.
Under the programme, 200 new electrical signal units and 200 automatic alarm bells will be setup at unprotected railway crossings.
A private company affiliated to the Moratuwa University, the Uni-Consultancy Services will implement the project under the supervision of the Transport Ministry.
The minister said there are 1,337 railroad crossings in Sri Lanka and out of these 526 have been properly protected with electrical signal devices. However, the minister said still there are 626 railway crossings which are only protected with bamboo gates.
Through this project, the ministry intends to minimise the bamboo gates and reduce the number of fatal accidents at railway crossings.
According to the minister, there around 75 fatal accidents at railway crossings annually due to motorists ignoring the signals.
The minister also said that CCTV cameras will be set up near busy railway crossings to identify errant drivers who violate railway crossing signals. The minister said strict legal action will be taken and hefty fines will be imposed on those who violate the signal rules.

Kerala floods recede over 400 deaths, 800,000 homeless
INDIA: Receding flood waters left Indian troops and rescuers the grim task Monday of hunting for bodies left by the worst monsoon in a century in Kerala state as the death toll rose above 400.
With nearly three quarters of a million people packed into relief camps in the southern state, known for its tourist beaches and hill resorts, authorities also fear outbreaks of disease.
After a week of fierce downpours, rainfall eased Monday and flood levels have fallen in many districts. Army helicopters and boats kept up missions to find trapped survivors and drop food and water in isolated villages.
Officials said 22,000 people were rescued on Sunday. At least 30 bodies were also found taking the death toll above 200 since the torrential rain started falling on August 8 and more than 400 since the monsoon started in June.
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the priority now was to provide clean drinking water and restore power supplies to the state of 33 million people. The total number of people taking refuge at the 5,645 relief camps has risen to over 800,000, Vijayan told reporters Sunday.
He said health officers would be deployed in each village to check the spread of communicable diseases. Thousands of army, navy and air force personnel have fanned out to help those stranded in remote and hilly areas.
Dozens of helicopters have been dropping tonnes of food, medicine and water over areas cut off due to damaged roads and bridges.
In worst hit areas such as Thrissur and Chengannur, rescuers are searching inundated houses where they have found the bodies of those trapped by the fast rising floodwaters.
They didnt think that it would rise this high -- 10 to 15 feet at some places -- when the initial warnings were issued, said Ashraf Ali K.M, who is leading the search in the small town of Mala in Thrissur.
Fishermen have sailed inland from Keralas coast to join the search, as volunteers set up soup kitchens and an international appeal was made for financial help.
Vijayan praised the fishermen for joining the rescue mission.
The state government said each boat would get 3,000 rupees ($43) for each day of their work and that authorities would pay for any damage to them.
The floods have caused an estimated $3 billion in damage but the bill is likely to rise as the scale of devastation becomes clearer.

Noyarh says he was abducted from his home and taken to Dompe safe house in a white van
SSC Girihagama informed the Magistrate that Kieth Noyarh had revealed that he was abducted from his home in Dehiwela and removed to a Military Intelligence safe-house in Dompe in a white van by a platoon led by Major Prabath Bulathwatte.
Those Army officials also stole his wallet and his wedding ring, Keith Noyarh stated in his statement.
What is your relationship with the LTTE, and who gave you information to publish those articles in your paper The Army officials asked, according to the statement of Noyarh.
They questioned me as to how I received information regarding an article published under the heading of Senpathi on the suicide bomb blast that took place at Lotus Road in Colombo.
One of the army officers continued to assault Keith, while questioning him. A call was received by one of the army officers who replied Yes Sir, Yes Sir. Soon after this call, he was ordered to wash and dress up. Thereafter, he was again put into the white van with his eyes covered and brought to Dehiwela.
Noyarh left for Australia soon after he was released by his abductors in 2008 and never returned to Sri Lanka. SSP Girihagama also submitted that the CID would obtain a statement from Army Intelligence Major Anzar who worked in the Maradana Tripoli camp. The Lance Corporal who worked at the Dompe Safe House was the main eye witness in this case. He had revealed that army officers had brought a man to the Dompe Safe house and assaulted him, SSC Girihagama added. Defence Counsel Nalinda Indatissa appearing on behalf of the Amal Karunasekara pleaded that his client be granted bail.
SSC Girihagama also stated that Amal Karunasekara had not revealed any information regarding his duties and responsibilities while he was serving as the former Military Intelligence Director. SSC Girihagama informed the Magistrate that the current Defence Secretary was unable to answer the questionnaires submitted by the CID. She further said investigations were delayed owing to this reason as well.
After considering all the matters, the Magistrate ordered the CID to submit the questionnaire to the current Defence Secretary to the court today (21). The Magistrate fixed the inquiry and bail order for August 27.

Speaker says not forced to make Police statement on Keith Noyarh abduction
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday insisted that he was not forced to make a statement to the Police on the abduction and assault of journalist Keith Noyarh.
In a media statement, Jayasuriya said that he had given the statement to the Police after they made a legitimate request after informing the courts.
The Speaker said doing his duty as a law abiding citizen, he informed the Police about all that he knew in connection with the incident.
The Speaker insisted that he did not make the statement with any malicious intent towards anyone but had done so as a law abiding citizen to help the course of justice and the law.
The Speakers Media Unit said Jayasuriya had decided to issue the statement after seeing several media reports in connection with his statement to the Police.
Jayasuriya had been the Public Administration Minister at the time of the incident and is said to be the first person to inform then President Mahinda Rajapaksa about Keith Noyarhs abduction.
Former Nation newspaper colleagues of Noyarh are said to have informed Karu Jayasuriya regarding Keith Noyarhs abduction.

Major drive to spur entrepreneurship
The first edition of the rapid rural infrastructure investment scheme, Enterprise Sri Lanka, Gamperaliya exhibition will be held in Moneragala District from August 29 -31 this year, said Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera.
The Minister said, Gamperaliya scheme will be the primary focus of the governments economic agenda over the next two years and the government hopes to organize the exhibition every three months covering many parts of the country.
Accordingly, the second and third editions of Enterprise Sri Lanka, Gamperaliya exhibition will be held in Anuradhapura and Jaffna.
The minister was speaking at a press briefing to introduce Enterprise Sri Lanka, Gamperaliya Exhibition at the Finance Ministry yesterday.
According to the minister the event will comprise 515 stalls and will see the participation of 204 corporate sector people both home and abroad.
Minister Samaraweera also revealed that the government under the Gamperaliya program has already set aside Rs 200 million per electorate for the next four months and intends to inject more money into the rural economy particularly for the development of rural roads, rural markets, and other public works under this program.
According to the Minister, the government hopes to provide close to Rs 32 billion for the Gamperaliya program for the next four months and said this year budget to be presented to Parliament will provide more funds to make this project a success in the coming years.
Speaking on reason behind selecting Moneragala as the first venue for the Enterprise Sri Lanka Gamperaliya exhibition, the Minister said, the district is suffering from acute poverty levels all these years and the main objective of the government is to take the development to the grass root level in Moneragala district and empower them.
Commenting on Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative, the Minister said the government has understood the needs of a new breed of young entrepreneurs and has put in place the necessary financial frameworks to support them. Enterprise Sri Lanka will be an ideal platform to create a conductive environment with fair and equal opportunities for the budding local entrepreneurs to contribute to the countrys development.
In addition, the government will be conducting a series of programs across the country to take the message of Enterprise Sri Lanka and Gamperaliya to the people.
Entrepreneurship is something that is in our DNA. During the pre and post colonial period, Sri Lanka had maintained robust global trade and entrepreneurial engagement with the rest of the world, the Minister said.
The Minister also said the government has embarked on an ambitious development revolution based on two important pillars, democracy and reconciliation.

MINIATURE FOAL
Furry animals which are smaller in size are some of the most adored creatures preferred as companions. But while breeds of canines and cats are popular, some unlikely animals with rare conditions also turn out to be surprisingly lovable.
Horses are known for their firm build which makes them ideal for riding, but a miniature horse in Russia is an exception to this idea associated with the creatures. The pony named Gulliver is just 19.29 inches from hoof to shoulder blades.
The American miniature horse was the size of a cat when it was born at Russias Hidalgo pony farm in 2017. Gulliver seemed content to be the bigger animal for a change as it played with a dog at a recent show.
The miniature horse is smaller than most others from his breed as most of them are 34 inches tall. This makes him a contender for the Guinness World Record as the smallest living male horse.

Jewelers Vishal Agarwal and Khushbu Agarwal of Surat, India, have broken the Guinness World Record for most diamonds set in one ring.
The ring the jewelers crafted contains 6,690 diamonds placed onto an 18 karat rose gold structure that is shaped like a lotus flower. The ring weighs more than a golf ball at just over 58 grams and is worth $4,116,787.
The previous record was set by Savio Jewelrys Peakcock ring in 2015 which contained 3,827 cut diamonds.
Vishal designed the ring which has 48 individual petals while Khushbu, who owns Hanumant Diamonds, funded the project. The lotus flower style was created in order to raise awareness about the importance of water conservation.
As fame is so much attached to a Guinness World Records title, we can put it to good use by bringing together like-minded people to work towards a beautiful world, they said in a statement.
A video, posted by Guinness World Records on recently, chronicles the making of the ring including the cutting and placing of the diamonds.

Although it was more or less anticipated, Gold seems to have impressed critics thanks to notable performances by the lead pair - Akshay Kumar and Mouni Roy - along with a talented ensemble cast. In the days leading up to the release, Akshay and Mouni were on a promotional spree, travelling the length and breath of the country to greet media personnel as well as fans. At one such event, Akshay even revealed that such was the buzz around the film that Mouni had already signed three films after Gold. The actress, who is best known for her role in the television show Naagin, has made her Bollywood debut in Gold and her performance has been appreciated.
Akshay is mighty impressed with Mouni and says that in a short span of time, the actress has got plum projects in her kitty and also has the talent to go a long way in the industry. He says that in the next decade, he assumes Mouni will easily do at least 42 films. The fact that she is already an established and known TV face will further help Mouni connect with the audiences. In Gold, she plays the role of Akshay Kumars Bengali wife.

## Title: In the national interest of foreign policy

## Date: Tuesday, August 21, 2018 - 01:00
In the national interest of foreign policy
Our foreign policy was crafted and implemented by diplomats under the guidance of the Head of State or Government for a long time after independence. Though the radical Left was vocal on foreign affairs as on other subjects the majority of the population kept aloof from engaging in any public debate on foreign policy.
Today the situation is quite different. In a welcome development foreign policy has become the topic of public discourse. However, it has its own negative consequences such as politicians of all ranks and statures who have become foreign policy experts overnight misleading the public. In this milieu, even some diplomats have abandoned traditional diplomacy concerned with less talk and more behind the scene negotiations and embraced what is called megaphone diplomacy to curry favour with the political authorities. Hence it would be appropriate to look at how our foreign policy is or should be crafted and what its salient features are.
Foreign policy is none other than an extension of the national policy. The Yahapalana Government refrained from unequivocally condemning the attack on Muslims at Digana and Ampara a few months ago and blaming the Sinhala Buddhist fundamental groups such as the Bodu Bala Sena. The same vacillation was evidenced in the instance of the attacks on Rohingya Muslims by Buddhist mobs in Myanmar showing a corresponding behaviour of the Government.
Also, a lacuna in our foreign policy could be explained by a lacuna in national policy among others. For example, if there are shortcomings or unclear issues in our trade policy as in the case of FTAs etc., it would affect foreign policy through foreign trade problems.
International relations
There are no Robinson Crusoes or solitary individuals in society. Man is essentially a social animal. Similarly, there cannot be any solitary countries in the world. Every country is compelled to exist in a network of international relations. For its own sustenance, it must take part in the international division of labour. To be successful national and foreign policies should not be contradictory.
Historical development has reached a stage where certain aspects of social life as human rights have become universal and the state of such rights in a particular country today is also a concern of other countries. This factor has to be considered in shaping the national and foreign policies of modern States. Human solidarity has become a potent force for social change as evidenced by numerous instances such as the Vietnamese struggle for independence and the struggle against apartheid in South Africa.
Today in a situation in which Sri Lankas balance of payments is unfavourable remittances from expatriates in the Middle East is a blessing that reduces the burden. Hence it would be prudent to maintain our relations with that region at an optimum level. But are we doing so
On the other hand, it is acknowledged that our principal trade relations are with Western powers that exert various pressures to influence our foreign policy. We would not be able to successfully meet this challenge unless we diversify foreign markets for our goods. This should be one of the priorities in our foreign policy. Is it so
As evidenced from above external factors, especially geopolitics, affects our foreign policy. Special attention has to be paid so as not to be swayed by pressures from powerful States and maintain our independence.
Interference in internal affairs
We are a small country strategically placed between two powerful States  India and China. Needless to say, that both of them will reach superpower status in the decades ahead. US Imperialism has already mapped out and is carrying out a strategy of forming a strategic alliance of the United States, India, Israel, Japan and Australia to counter the growing influence of China. It is also wooing other countries including Sri Lanka and Vietnam to this alliance.
Sri Lanka has very good relations with both India and China since historical times. In fact the bulk of economic assistance we get come from them. Hence it would not be prudent to join such an alliance. Hence a strategy should be crafted to be equidistant from such rival powers while maintaining our cordial relations with both. This is easily said than done. The best course of action could be a move to form a tripartite economic and political cooperation among Sri Lanka, China and Sri Lanka akin to that between China, Japan and South Korea.
It would also be prudent for Sri Lanka to join the Shanghai Cooperation Council (SCO) as a full member. India and China are full members while Sri Lanka is at present only a dialogue partner. Similarly, it should join the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). Taking an active role in these bodies would reduce the chances of being dragged to rivalries between power blocs.
US interest in Sri Lanka has grown substantially since this Government assumed office. Peace Corps which was sent packing from Sri Lanka earlier on allegations of interference in internal affairs is coming back. Uncle Sam has been generous enough to grant the US $ 39 m military aid. Though far away, the US is considering the Indo-Pacific area as its backyard and theatre of command.
At present, Sri Lankan foreign policy seems to be with wavering on certain issues. For example, Sri Lanka has been a staunch supporter of the Palestinian peoples struggle for a homeland. However, it abstained from voting on a resolution supporting Palestine at the UNESCO. Also, our interest in the Non-Aligned Movement seems to have waned with the improvement of relations with the United States. Sri Lanka being a leading member of the movement should take the initiative to revive it for its objectives are still valid. Though the former East-West power blocs do not exist, new rivalries and power blocs are emerging and threatening regional and world peace. The threat of nuclear war has not receded.
We should not blame other countries for pursuing their national interests through their foreign policies. It is to be expected. Our foreign policy should be based on our national interests. But are we sure what our national interests are

New insurance scheme for fisherfolk
State Fisheries Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, addressing the gathering of Tangalle fisherfolk who received new insurance policies recently , said that the fisherfolk now live with the dignity of fishing as a profession, due to the facilities provided to them by the yahapalana regime.
He said he is quite aware of the difficulties faced by fisherfolk.
The state minster said that a government servant retires at a certain age, but a fisherman engages in the occupation of fishing well into old age. He said that the multiday boats have been insured and the necessity has arisen to insure ordinary fishing craft.
Describing the privileges of the new insurance scheme for fisherfolk, the state minister said that a fisherman has to pay only Rs. 995 per year for compensation of Rs.12 lakhs for an accident, while Rs. 2.5 lakhs will be paid as compensation in case of death, along with hospital fees and facilities for the education of children.
The state minister said that a fear psychosis reigned during the previous regime and now people live in peace and harmony.
He said that the present regime took over a debt-ridden economy due to the mismanagement of the previous regime.

No Ronaldo, no Zidane, no problem as Real start La Liga with victory
Madrid, Sunday: Real Madrid got their La Liga campaign off to a winning start with a 2-0 victory at home to Getafe on Sunday in their first league outing since the summer departures of Cristiano Ronaldo and coach Zinedine Zidane.
The European champions ensured the three points at the Santiago Bernabeu with a 20th-minute goal from Dani Carvajal and a Gareth Bale strike on 51 minutes.
Keylor Navas held on to his place as Real Madrids starting goalkeeper despite the arrival of Thibaut Courtois.
Costa Rica international Navas has been first choice since 2015 but had been expected to make way for Courtois, a recent 35-million-euro recruit from Chelsea who was voted best goalkeeper at this summers World Cup.
Julen Lopetegui, who replaced Zidane as coach, also selected Nacho at the heart of the defence rather than French World Cup winner Raphael Varane.
Real, playing their first La Liga game since the departure of Ronaldo to Juventus, went into Sundays game on the back of a 4-2 defeat to Atletico Madrid in the UEFA Supercup in midweek.
But they were rarely in trouble on Sunday.
Bale was unlucky when a diving header came back off the crossbar in the first half before the Welshman was key in the build-up to the first goal with Carvajal heading in his cross.
Another defensive error helped Real grab their second goal when Marco Asensio stole the ball and sent over a cross for Bale to score with his left foot.
Asensio was close to getting his name on the scoresheet but was denied by the woodwork. Meanwhile, Portuguese striker Andre Silva marked his La Liga debut with a hat-trick as Sevilla romped to a 4-1 win at Rayo Vallecano, surpassing his total of goals scored for AC Milan in the whole of last seasons Serie A.
Silva had managed just two goals for the Serie A giants and was loaned out to Sevilla this summer.
Franco Mudo Vazquez opened the scoring with a backheel in the 15th minute before Silva bagged his first just after the half hour mark.The 22-year-old added his second in first-half stoppage time after a corner and completed his hat-trick 10 minutes from time. However, he endured a nervous wait before he could celebrate, requiring the VAR to overturn an offside decision which had ruled out Silvas effort.
It was the first time in La Liga history that the VAR had made such an intervention. The system was called upon again in the last minute when Adrian Embarba converted a penalty for Rayo after the referee had initially whistled for a free-kick outside the box.  AFP

OGM Foods bags Merit Award at CNCI Achiever Awards 2018
OGM Foods & Company (Pvt) Limited, one of the most popular companies in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) segment in rice flour industry won the Provincial Level Merit Award under the Small Category  Manufacturing sector, at the CNCI Achiever Awards 2018.
The Award Ceremony was organized by the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) and was held recently at Hotel Galadari for the 17th consecutive year. CNCI annually organizes this coveted Achiever Awards Competition to recognize and reward the industrialists in the manufacturing and service sectors.
Household consumption drives the majority of sales in the FMCG segment. Growth in this segment has increased considerably in emerging markets in recent years. Appreciating this trend in the market, Zubair who had served the nation as a public servant in the capacity of a Grade I School Principal started a new venture simultaneously with his busy schedules in 1992with the unstinted supporting hand of Zubair in the hope of creating a proud future for their family.
They started the business with all family members to make rice flour in their kitchen, which was gradually expanded with his retirement, developed into an industry of Roasted Rice Flour and Spices in the face of heavy demand for their products. There was no retirement life for Mr and Mrs Zubair and they had to sacrifice their whole comforts and spent tireless days and sleepless nights to let their children stand on their own feet.
The Product has now been branded as OGM - Roasted Rice Flour. After a lapse of a period of above 25 years, they now possess a fully-fledged and well organized business. Their Head Office, stores and Spice Division are situated in Mawanella, while their factory is situated in Kekirawa. They have generated much direct and indirect employment now.
Nyfer Zubair, the son of Zubair is heading the business now as the Chairman and the business is run by Riyas M Thoufeek as the General Manager. They have a growing market and the market share is getting widened. The secret behind the increasing demand for their products is mainly for three reasons, Nyfer said. One is the genuineness of their products, the second being their innovativeness based on the customer needs.
More importantly, the third is the dedication of their employees. Nyfer Zubair, with tearful eyes, thankfully acknowledged the great pains taken and the sweats shed by his parents along with the contribution made by his brother Imran to bring the company where it is today.

Pant joins rare list of players to get off the mark with a six in Test cricket
Rishabh Pant made his Test debut in the Nottingham Test replacing Dinesh Karthik who failed to impress with the bat and his keeping skills in the first two matches of the series. The 20-year-old came in with a reputation of being a big-hitter having put up quite a display of himself in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He exploits in Ranji Trophy and in the recent tour to England with India A earned the Delhi player his maiden Test call-up.
Pant, staying true to his reputation, got off the mark in Test cricket with a six off Adil Rashid on the 2nd ball he faced. Thus, he became the first Indian to open his account in Tests with a six and overall the 12th player to do so. He lofted the googly from the leg-spinner over the straight boundary. Pant is only the 3rd player to hit a six in this format as early as the 2nd ball of his career.
Australias Eric Freeman was the first known man in the list when he struck a huge six off Erapalli Prasanna on the very 2nd ball he faced in this format at the Gabba in 1968. Carlisle Best of West Indies got going in the longer format when he hooked Ian Botham for a six on the 3rd ball he faced in the 1986 Kingston Test. Zimbabwes Keith Dabengwa hit Daniel Vettori for a six to get off the mark that too after facing 15 balls in 2004 while West Indies Dale Richards achieved this feat in the first over of his teams innings in his Test debut against Bangladesh in 2009.
Jahirul Islam, who bagged a 6-ball duck in the first innings on his Test debut, opened his account with a six off Graeme Swann in the 2nd innings. Al-Amin Hossain didnt get a chance to get off the mark in the longer format on his Test debut but opened his account with sixes in both innings in the next game. New Zealands Mark Craig achieved a unique distinction of hitting the first ball he faced in Test cricket for a six which was coincidently the first ball he faced in International cricket as well.
SRI LANKAS DHANANJAYA DE SILVA, Bangladeshs Kamrul Islam Rabbi and Sunil Ambris are the recent entries in the list. Kamrul Islam, the 4th Bangladesh player in the list scored his first runs in Test cricket on the 20th ball he faced after bagging three ducks in his first three innings. Ambris opened his account after getting out for a duck in the first innings on his debut via hit-wicket. Ct

People tired of strikes
The recent spate of strikes staged by the Railway workers, doctors and private bus operators has drawn heavy criticism from the general public and has also raised doubts as to whether these striking parties were in fact fighting for their rights or if these strikes were politically motivated.
The recent Railway strike left commuters stranded by evening, unable to return to their homes as the strike was sudden.
However, despite Railway trade unions demands and refusal to call off the strike, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera was adamant and refused to give in. The strike was eventually called off without any gain, which only inconvenienced the public.
The Daily News spoke to a cross-section of society in a bid to get their views on these recent strikes.
The Media Secretary of the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry, Viraj Abeysinghe noted that although it could not be said definitely if there was some political agenda behind these strikes, the manner in which these sudden strikes have been conducted and the failure to try all other options prior to launching such strikes, gives an indication of some political backing or agenda.
Generally all trade unions are affiliated to some political party, but despite their political affiliations, these unions should be fighting for the rights of their members, in order to uplift the quality of work of the relevant institution they are working for. But, in the case of the Railway Department strike, it seemed like they definitely had some political agenda.
They operated normally in the morning and people came to work as usual, but suddenly they announced a strike and the commuters were all stranded, unable to get back to their homes in the evening. They put the people in great difficulty by this, he said.
Abeysinghe noted that in such instances it was very clear that these strikes were being carried out with the aim of putting the government into disrepute. Some demands put forward by these striking unions were justified and fair, but most of them were not. The government cannot simply agree to raise the wages of just one government institution and not provide the rest of the institutions the same privileges, he said.
Currently, the government has to bear the burden of repaying huge debts and as such it is not possible to take on the added burden of salary increments, said Abeysinghe, adding that these increments have to be in accordance with all other government institutions. This is why the government cannot grant the demands put forward by Railway workers, he said.
Due to the recent strikes launched by the Railway workers, the Railway Department had to incur losses exceeding Rs. 70 million per month, in addition to its running at a Rs. 40 million loss anyway.
The Railway Department is not a profit-making institution, but it should not be running at a loss either. According to Abeysinghe, the Railway Department cannot keep running at a loss and it has also been proposed to increase the railway fares in order to cover this loss. The Railway fares have not been increased in over six years. Although we dont need to make profits, we cannot keep running this department at a loss either, he said, adding that under such a situation, the demand by Railway workers to increase their wages was definitely unfair.
According to a member of the GMOA who did not wish to be named, the strikes by the doctors cannot be condoned, especially as it deals with the lives of low-income patients. He said in the past, although several strike actions were staged, it was only as a last resort, after having held discussions and bargaining on their demands. But, today there is no discussion of their issues or bargaining; all of a sudden the doctors struck work, leaving the patients stranded. These trade unions are established mainly for the best interest of the workers, but the recent doctors strike over the Singapore free trade agreement has no relevance, raising suspicion on whether these strikes are launched for political purposes rather than for the rights of doctors.
The GMOA member said that it seems as if some political powers are using the GMOA to achieve their goals. He said due to these strikes, medical faculties have been closed for a year, which in turn would create a shortage of medical interns in the future. He said certain GMOA members were using their GMOA membership for political purposes.
The doctors have been given pay hikes although they strike. In fact, their extra duty allowance has been increased by around Rs.10,000 and their basic salaries have been doubled. All in all, the GMOA member said that the government had increased doctors wages by over Rs.50,000 since coming into power. Hence, the motive behind these strikes is questionable, as it does not seem to have any justification, as the doctors have already benefitted far more than many other professions have.
Meanwhile, the following are several views expressed by the public on the recent strikes.

PetroKazakhstan project to boost oil processing capabilities
The second phase of the revamp and modernization project of PetroKazakhstan Oil Products in Shymkent, Kazakhstan, was completed on Wednesday.
It will significantly increase the oil processing capability and oil quality of the China-Kazakhstan joint venture.
The commissioning of the second phase of the project also started on Wednesday, and the company has continuously produced qualified products since then.
The project will significantly enhance the crude oil processing depth of the company, improve its light oil products yield by more than 20 percent, and increase its oil processing capacity from about 4 million metric tons a year to 6 million tons, said Wei Yuxiang, president of PetroKazakhstan.
Built in 1985, PetroKazakhstan Oil Products, one of the top three largest oil refineries in Kazakhstan, became a 50-50 joint venture between China National Petroleum Corporation and KazMunayGas, a state-owned oil and gas company of Kazakhstan, in 2007.
The refinery started the revamp and modernization project in 2014.
It is a major project that combines Chinas Belt and Road Initiative with Kazakhstans Bright Path economic policy, said Bian Dezhi, president of CNPC Central Asia. Divided into two phases, the project is contracted to CNPC, the worlds third-largest oil company, which holds a 50 percent stake in PetroKazakhstan Oil Products. The first phase of the project was completed in June 2017, improving the level of oil quality from the previous Euro II standard to Euro IV and Euro V standards, said Bian. The project will play a key role in improving the local ecological environment, creating 400 more jobs, increasing tax income of the local government, and promoting upgrade and modernization of Kazakh industries, he said.
CNPC Central Asia is highly localized, with 98 percent of its employees coming from local countries and regions.

## Title: Pioneering the new age of tea in China

Pioneering the new age of tea in China
While the milk tea shop that Nie Yunchen set up in Jiangmen, Guangdong province, in 2012 was a tiny business operation that measured no more than 20 square meters, he harbored ambitions that were far larger  he wanted to create a globally recognized tea brand like what Starbucks is in the coffee industry.
Five years after making that initial investment of 150,000 yuan ($21,780), Nies milk tea chain Heytea raked in a whopping 600 million yuan in revenue, a 100-percent increase from the previous year.
Today, there are more than 100 Heytea branches across 13 Chinese cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen.
When Heytea made its foray into the east China market by opening its first store in Shanghai last February, the company had to request for police presence as the queue of customers stretched for hundreds of meters. Some customers had to wait for as long as seven hours just to buy a 25-yuan cup of tea. Scalpers loitered away from the queues, offering cups to those who lack the patience to get in line  for three times the price.
The brand is also renowned for popularizing the cheese-foamed tea, which has become such a hit among the masses that it is now featured on the menus of thousands of coffee and tea chains and even well-established Chinese and Western restaurants.
Its beyond a doubt that a super brand will rise from the category of modern Chinese tea. And the influence of this super brand must be worldwide, Nie said.
This super brand may not be Heytea, but it must come from China.
According to Nie, Heytea will open 100 new stores in the Chinese mainland, as well as outlets in Singapore and Hong Kong by the end of this year. The brand also plans to expand its footprint to include the European and US markets in the near future.
The only son of two geologists, Nie made his first bucket of gold at the age of 19 by selling smart phones. Determined to create something as impactful as what Steve Jobs has done with Apple, Nie chose to enter the tea industry two years later.
I never want to be just selling stuff. Selling doesnt create value. Instead, I want to create things that ideally leave an impact on the world. It has to be a cause that is worth devoting my youth to, said Nie.
The founder speaks to China Daily USA about the brand and its plans for the future in Shanghai, ahead of the opening of its flagship store at the Disney resort in late August.
Q. Why do you want to introduce Heytea to foreign markets
A. At one point, we thought China itself might be a big enough market for us. Most businesses only need to focus on the two super markets globally  US and China. However, as we became more assured of our performance and were convinced that we were on the right track to success, we realized that having a presence in some of the key markets worldwide is not just about boosting sales  it is also about being the best in the world.
We definitely want to penetrate the local market further. It would be of little significance if the main consumers of our overseas outlets are Chinese living in these foreign lands. In terms of price, our product is affordable enough to become a daily product most people consume. Moreover, we hope Heytea can be more than a drink or a brand, but a cultural symbol and a namecard that says Chinas thousand-year-old tea culture can be young and fun.
Q. Do you think that cheese-foamed tea might just be a fad
A. Heytea has never been positioned as a brand of cheese-foamed tea, or any type of tea. Heytea is built on rejuvenating Chinese tea and making young Chinese interested in tea. My confidence doesnt come from Heytea or myself, but the nations tea tradition that has been around for thousands of years. Any certain type of tea can be outdated. But tea itself will not.
Q. What do you think is the unique advantage of Heytea
A. Heytea didnt invent the foam tea  but we made it better. Generally, we make common tea beverages taste better. Over the past decade, the milk tea industry has been using powder so heavily that it has scared many consumers away. For some time, young girls, once the core customers of the industry, would rather choose a bottle of water than a cup of milk tea. There is nothing illegal or wrong with using powder, but no one today would want to consume so much powder.
When we discovered the foam tea and saw it as a potential breakthrough to rejuvenate the tea industry, we decided to replace the powder with real ingredients such as milk and cheese that would be more appealing to consumers.
I think one of the major reasons why young people are not fond of tea is because of the slight bitterness which can be balanced with the creamy and smooth cheese foam. Also, the sweet aftertaste of the tea makes up for the short finish many dairy products have on the palate.
Q. Who do you think is the main competitor of Heytea
A. I dont think we have one key competitor in the tea drinking industry today because the market is so fragmented and current players arent competitive enough. The industry is also growing much faster than any brand or company. So Id say that the game has yet to even begin.
Q. What do you think of Starbucks
A. Its a respectable food chain with consistent value and identity, something Chinese enterprises should emulate. Most businesspeople in China prefer putting their money in the real estate market or peer-to-peer funding because they just want to make money quickly. Starbucks affects the way we decide our product prices, which are 10 yuan lower than their average offerings. As confident as I am about my products, I believe that as a latecomer thats the only way to disrupt the market established by a predecessor.
Q. Do you think coffee is an enemy of tea in China
A. No, I think the interest in coffee has been exaggerated in China, especially in lower-tiered cities. The real enemy of tea is old tea  which either has been downgraded to a cup of additives or overpriced to the levels of antiques because of speculation. Its time for China, the worlds largest economy, to have a right cup of tea.

The Sage of Shantiniketan on the stage of Ruhuna Sarasavi
Pulse of a tradition
'Rabindranath Tagore was born on May 7, 1861 and passed away on August 7, 1941, at the age of 80. As a versatile artist, a poet and a musician his expertise spanned a significant number of different subject areas. This is why he is highly respected by the literary world as a polymath who reshaped the Bengali literature, arts and South-Asian music. In 1913, he became the first non-European Nobel Prize Winner in Literature. Tagore visited nearly thirty countries and paid three visits to Sri Lanka- in 1922, 1928 and 1934. On May 22, 1934 Gurudev Tagore visited Matara, his last foreign visit. After 84 years the Ruhuna Sarasavi declares open the giant auditorium of 3,000 sqm with a theatre facilitating 1,500 seats with an estimated cost of SLR 265 million, in honour of the Sage of Sahantiniketan. The Southern Province is grateful to the Indian Government and this article is published as a mark of respect to the all partners, on the occasion of the inauguration of Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium, on September 3, 2018, at Ruhuna University premises'
Tagores creative talents witness the quality of reputed work, Gitanjali, with profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse. He is more often referred to as the Shakespeare of Bengal by the outside India. Tagore restructured and modernized Bengali art by spurning inflexible and traditional classical forms and resisting linguistic structures.
The earliest extant work in Bengali literature is the Charyapada (or Charyagiti, composed by 23 poets), a collection of Buddhist mystic songs inspired by Mahayana tantric traditions, dating back to the 9th Century. After the medieval centuries the time line of Bengali literature is divided into two periods. The Bengali language uses the Devanagari style like Sanskrit and Hindi. Today, the Bengali claims a rich heritage of language and literature, in the Indian subcontinent. According to the official statics (2017) 300 million people speak Bangali, the mother tongue of Tagore, becoming known as the 7th World Language, following Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, English, Arabic and Portuguese. The 7th place of the Bengali language, in the Indian subcontinent, was an additional favour to the local writers for their publications.
Rabi (nickname of Tagore) was the youngest child of Debendranath Tagore (father) and Sarada Devi (mother), in a big family of thirteen children. In his early childhood Rabis mother had died and Rabi was raised by servants. There were regular visits of tutors and musicians at home. The doors were open to the Hindustani classical artists and Rabi grew up in an intimate group of family music band.
His elder brother Dwijendranath was a philosopher and poet, a decent character with good temperament. Satyendranath, another brother, was the first Indian appointed to the Indian Civil Service. Jyothirindranath became a famous musician in the region who was a composer and a playwright and his wife Kadambari Devi was very dear to younger Rabi. His sister Swarnakumari was a novelist. This small child was particularly influenced by these two ladies as Tagore had only a memory of his late mother. Tagore preferred roaming and observing natural beauty in their lands and nearby villages, than classroom. Another brother, Hemachandranath was the cherished friend than a brother and he was very careful about Rabi and he had a high regard for his younger brothers adventures like swimming in Gange or passing through hills near Bolpur or Panihat. The two brothers practiced gymnastics, Judo and wrestling.
The young Tagore had a great literary background of Indian philosophies and religions such as Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. His mother tongue was refined through many centuries by Vedic Sanskrit, Hybrid Sanskrit and number of other Indian dialects both Aryan and Dravidian. As a result, he was extremely keen in writing even at the age of eight and he could release his early substantial collection of poems at the age of sixteen. In this work he used the pseudonym Bhanusimha (Sun Lion). But by the same period he published his first short stories and dramas under his authentic name. Through these early literary works he confirmed, what is more, his personal quality as a Humanist, Universalist, Internationalist and fervent anti-Nationalist and in addition he was an ardent young scholar who condemned the British rule.
New beginning
Tagore was an extraordinary supporter in the campaign of the Bengal resurgence using his entire vitality to bring a new beginning to the nation through his artistic creations. Paintings, sketches, a large number of texts and essays, and thousand of songs were followed by the then young generation. As an initial step to the higher education he gifted his country and the world, Shantiniketan, and later Vishva Bharti University that was inaugurated in the same premises. This most renowned Indian University has produced a great generation of alumni, Bengali and Sri Lankan, that includes Nobel Prize winning economist Amartya Sen, globally reputed filmmaker Satyajit Ray and the countrys foremost art historian R. Siva Kumar, to name just a few.
Tagores attractiveness and popularity gave more and more young Sri Lankan students to realize their dreams at Shantiniketan to study music, drama, dancing, painting and philosophy as well as religion. Among the former students of Tagore, Ediriweera Sarachchandra, Ananda Samarakoon, Sunil Shantha, L.T.P. Manjusri, Lionel Edirisinghe, Chitrasena, W. B. Makuloluwa have done a great contribution to the promotion of Sri Lankan culture, education and administration.
Yasunari Kawabata was a Japanese novelist and short story writer who won the Nobel Prize in 1968. Kawabata treasured memories from his middle-school days of this sage-like poet. Juan Ramon Jiminez was a Spanish poet who was awarded Nobel Prize in 1956. In 1913, he and his wife-to-be had begun translating Gitanjali.
It is commonly accepted that Tagore had enormous influence on Latin American poets. In a lecture on Tagores manuscripts, given at the University of Delhi by Octavio Paz, he highlights Although Rabindranath has influenced some of our Hispanic-American poets, none of our poets have had any kind of influence on him.
Tagores work
Tagore regularly advised his students to break away from the traditional concepts of arts and literature and to experience ones own creation through profound introspection. His novels, short stories, songs, dancing, dramas and essays discuss fresh themes not traditional. The topics are based on the modern society, political, social or personal. He argues in his works the themes like nationalism, the turbulence of imperialism and the importance of fresh artistic creations in order to awaken the mind. He was the only lyricist or bard and musician welcome by the neighbouring countries to compose their national anthems: Jana gana mana abhinaayaka jaya hey, Indian and Amar shonar Bangla, ami tomay bhalobhashi Bangla. Sri Lankan National anthem was also inspired by Tagores work.
Tagore had to take more and more efforts to develop Vishva Bharati and he was facing enduring difficulties to fund this institution. Today there are 32 Universities in Bengal. The foreign academic experts have also well recognized the Bengali studies all over the world, i.e. the world universities are offering courses and organising research works in different level of degree programmes. Among them, the Department of South-Asia of the Faculty of Language and Civilizations at University of Paris (Sorbonne); St-Petersburg State University in Russia; Faculty of Oriental Studies in University of Oxford; South-Asian Department in University of Chicago; Institute of South-Asia in University of Berkley; SOAS University of London; Tokyo University of Foreign Studies and Goethe University of Frankfurt are a few of them. The above dynamic educational and cultural relations on international arena attest also the enthusiastic diplomatic relations of the Bengal government, a heritage of the thought of Tagore.
Tagore himself had a great attention and concern regarding the people of Sri Lanka. Once he regret for not being able to communicate in Sinhala. He was very interested in some aspect of Sri Lankan Buddhist culture influenced by local traditions, ritual items as well as the Mahayana and Hindu customs. He also had a fascination of Sri Lankan history which had begun by the arrival of Vijaya, the leader of Sinhala immigrants came from Bangali (Vanga Desha).

Rain-larker at odds with the weather gods!
As a child, living in my grandfathers suburban estate, I was an incurable rain-larker. My ayah and the rest of the retainers were well aware that they had to keep a weather eye on their self-willed charge. They despaired at my incorrigible fondness to gambol in the showery lavish flow of rain. After all, I was their responsibility.
Still, I simply could not resist running out in the middle of a refreshing cloudburst. Either fully clothed or bare bodied I revelled in the prospect of drenching myself in the excitement of being one with nature. But by the time I was six, I soon learned that all but fools are unafraid of lethal lightning.
Some of the older workers tried to scare the rompers off me by relating tales about the Hindu rain god Indra, who when angry possessed the ability to hurl death-dealing thunderbolts at anyone or anything he disliked.
There came the day when I experienced a manifestation of the darker side of natures schizophrenic temperament in its most unrelenting, murderous form. I was larking around in a downpour at the furthest end of the large courtyard when all hell broke loose as the Heavens opened up. The skies were bursting with loud crashes of thunder and flashing volts of thunderbolts and the rain was bucketing down in torrents.
I knew there was no place for refuge to ward off the terror unleashed by the monsoon madness until I reached the safety of home. The blazing streaks darted across the skies time and again lighting up the entire scene for a split second of time. Squall after squall of howling winds impeded my motion adding to the medley of the chilling nightmare tableau.
It appeared to me that the heavens were waging a vengeful war against my surroundings and targeting me personally. I believed that the weather gods, or whoever ruled over the forces of harmony and nature, had for some reason gone into a paroxysm of rage.
Retainers and workers peeping from the security of alcoves from both sides of the open arcade screamed as multiple streaks and bright balls of flame seemed to pursue my running figure. This was no ordinary storm and these were no ordinary flashes of lightning.
I wondered as I ran whether some vicious and vindictive deity was attempting to skewer me with a lance of lightning from above. But soon I reached the expansive open veranda and skidded through the kitchen doorway. In that same instant there was a deafening thunderclap followed by a hissing crackling sound and I felt a rush of hot, sizzling air sideswiping my behind.
The retainers witnessing the whirling, flaming orb pursuing me observed the encounter clearly. In that heart-stopping moment they all perceived the deadly fireball lingering for a split second over my vanishing form and then disappear in a flashover with a sharp blast. They assumed the worst.
In reality the fire ball had flashed over the outside of my sprinting form slightly searing the bottom of my blue drill shorts just as I turned sharply through the kitchen doorway. Apart from the fact that the seat of my trousers had been singed the bolt had not left any external signs of injury nor burns on my physique.
The old estate watchman, Govinda expressing his complete jubilation at the sight of my unscathed form uttered a prayer to his gods. Then in total contradiction to his thanksgiving reverence he rushed into the garden arms outstretched and screamed a litany of curses at the skies.
When it comes to sheer authentic swearing few languages can be as colourful and eloquently expressive as both the Sinhala and Tamil vernacular. Old Govinda was an incorrigible swearer and a darned good one too. He had earned a dubious reputation as some sort of celebrity in the village because of his proficiency in profanity.
He possessed the ability to out-cuss the best of them with equal facility in both languages. The old watchman was unrivalled in his range of obscene curses and oaths in an environment peopled by a bunch of versatile opponents in the art of filthy vituperation.
Govinda was elated by the sight of my remaining unharmed. Now with the comparable abatement of the storm and his spirits fortified by copious quantities of potent moonshine the sentinel of the estate began literally throwing caution to the winds and challenging the celestial beings. The grizzled watchman with soaked sarong tucked up to his bandy-legged thighs had ventured into the open courtyard with purposeful stride.
Then with arms outstretched skywards he began a sort of primitive rain dance and began hurling vile imprecations at every deity of the ecosystem. His expletives were blasphemous, to say the least, as he reviled the gods with a malediction of insults whose blueness could have outshone the brightest azure skies.
His colleagues and the rest of the household staff were scandalized at his behaviour. They all believed that there were limits to even providential patience. It became apparent that the divinities too seemed far from amused at the sacrilegious scoffing of an old, unbridled degenerate and their retaliation it seemed came sooner than anyone had expected.
The rejoinder from the wild blue yonder was executed with dramatic and resounding effect. The profane old watchmans immediate surroundings were assailed with lethal lances of lightning in consort with sharp thunder-cracks. The old buffoon recoiled in horror as the deadly bombshells from the dome of the earth came perilously close, seemingly intent on puncturing his heretical hide.
As the flashes exploded precariously close to his feet the quailing watchman was constrained to perform a lively tap-dancing highland-fling of sorts to avoid the deadly bursts. He cursed himself while bouncing out of the range of the retaliatory flaming arrows hurled from the astral plane.
Skittering and skipping he made a desperate dash inside and dived through the kitchen doorway. He flung himself into a corner of the large kitchen begging forgiveness for his impiety and questioning the deities whether they had lost all sense of humour.

Regulatory Commission for three-wheelers to be appointed
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said that a separate agency will be appointed to regulate the Three wheeler service in the country.
The minister while stressing the need of regulating this service added that over 1.2 million families in the country depend on income generated from three wheelers. He stressed that it is not appropriate to stop this service or take measures to control three wheelers. Samaraweera said that he is against the decision to impose a minimum age limit of 35 on three wheeler drivers on issuing licences. Imposition of age limit for issuing licences for three wheelers is a violation of Fundamental Right and I will discuss this issue at the Cabinet meeting today, the minister said.
The minister was of the view that this service should be continued by giving proper training and knowledge to the three wheeler drivers.
This service should be turned into a disciplined service, the minister said.
He said that the government has already implemented this programme as a Tuk Tuk service.
Minister Samaraweera added that he has decided to extend the loan facilities with a concessionary interest rate to the Tuk Tuk drivers and their spouses under Enterprise Sri Lanka to as a self employment venture.

Remembering terror victims
Terrorism is one of the scourges of the modern world, where armed non-state actors target both military and civilian installations and people in the name of upholding an ideology or winning a territory. In the words of UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, terrorism is one of the most challenging issues of our time and a serious threat to international peace and security. From Tajikistan to the United Kingdom, from Baghdad to Barcelona, these ruthless attacks have shaken us all to the core. No country can consider itself immune, with almost every nationality in the world falling victim to terrorist attacks.
We in Sri Lanka probably have more experience regarding the horrors of terrorism than people in most other countries which have recently been affected. Sri Lanka faced the bane of terrorism for nearly 30 years and it was only 10 years ago that it was vanquished. In fact, Sri Lanka is among the handful of countries that had successfully dealt with the threat of terror.
While more countries are affected by terrorism today, the number of victims has largely been concentrated in a small number of countries. In 2017 alone, nearly three-quarters of all deaths caused by terrorism were in just five countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia and Syria. There have also been terrorist attacks in countries such as the UK, France, Turkey and Belgium. The death toll from global terrorism-related attacks accounted for approximately 6,123 fatalities in 2017, but it is a large decrease from the 25,673 that occurred in 2016, of which 9,765 deaths were in Iraq alone, and much less than the peak of 31,321 deaths in 2014.
The Islamic State (IS) was the deadliest terrorist group in 2016, responsible for killing 9,132 people, and the next three deadliest terror groups Boko Haram, Taliban, and Al-Qaeda, killed 6,011 people in the same year. The September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Centre Twin Towers in the US remains the single biggest terror attack with over 3,000 recorded deaths. The world needs to formulate a coordinated response to terrorism, with better intelligence gathering and cross-border cooperation in order to avoid further carnage.
In todays 24/7 news cycle, these sometimes look only like numbers. But behind each number is a person who was near and dear to his or her family and friends. That number could have been a breadwinner in the family. That number could have been someone who had skills and talents needed by his or her country. Victims of terrorism all over the world continue to struggle to have their voices heard, have their needs supported and their rights upheld. Victims often feel forgotten and neglected once the immediate aftermath of a terrorist attack fades, which can have profound consequences for them.
After terrorist attacks, we rarely hear about those who were killed and injured; the ordinary women, men, girls and boys, who were going about their daily business when their lives ended or were changed forever. We rarely hear about their surviving families, friends and communities, who must learn to live with the burden of terrorism for their entire lives. Only a few countries have the resources or the capacity to fulfill the medium and long-term needs required for victims to fully recover, rehabilitate and integrate back into society. Victims can only recover and cope with their trauma through long-term multi-dimensional support, including physical, psychological, social and financial, in order to heal and live with dignity.
This is the primary idea behind the first-ever observance of the International Day of Remembrance of and Tribute to Victims of Terrorism. Today, the International day of Remembrance of, and Tribute to, the victims of terrorism, reminds us to stop and listen to the victims and survivors of terrorism, to raise their voices and recognize the impact terrorism has on their lives. Even if physical scars of terrorism and conflict can be healed, it is often very difficult and sometimes virtually impossible to heal the mental scars.
In some instances, the conflict itself can be resolved per se, but the underlying causes and the mutual distrust among different communities affected by the conflict can take a long time to be addressed. There are some conflicts which ended decades ago, but those affected are still searching for answers and peace. The conflict in Sri Lanka is no different. It was a conflict that pitted brother against brother and sister against sister, exacerbated by extremist politicians in both the North and the South. Nearly 10 years later, we are in the nascent stage of searching for peace and reconciliation, which cannot, of course, be achieved overnight after a 30-year conflict. We have to address the grievances of victims on all sides. If we do not open our hearts to each other, the search for reconciliation will be in vain. If we still look at other communities with a prejudiced eye, peace will remain elusive. It is a process that should begin in and from the heart, until we all think of ourselves as Sri Lankans first and foremost with no petty divisions and differences.

SL lasses beat Indonesia and Japan at kabaddi
Lankan womens kabbadi team displayed superb teamwork to register two victories against host Indonesia and Japan at the 18th Asian Games continued in Jakarta yesterday. The Lankan lasses tasted bitter defeat in their first game against Thailand (15-41), but bounced back strongly to put themselves in line for a medal with back to back victories.
Sri Lanka beat host Indonesia 34-17 after leading 17-6 at half time in yesterdays first match. Sri Lanka scored another 17 points while restricting the opponents to 11 in the second half to tame host Indonesia. The Lankan girls entered the second game against Japan with confidence and fought a hard battle against strong outfit. Lanka trailed by two points midway (8-10) but continued their attacking playing style in the second half adding 14 more points while conceding only seven points to their rivals to seal victory.
It is a great achievement by the Lankan womens kabbadi team to record two victories without their captain Madushani Chathurika who did not play yesterday due to an injury. The victorious team was led by Nimashi Kokila in the two games.
An elated Nimashi said that it is a remarkable achievement by the Lankan team to grab these wins in their first appearance at an Asian Games. It was due to our good teamwork we were able to win the two games. We did the hardest thing by winning back to back games in a single day and hope we will perform much better in the rest of the games to win a medal and make our country proud, she said.
Today the Lankan girls will take on strong India and if Sri Lanka beat India, they will easily qualify for the semi-finals.
Lankan mens kabbadi team also delivered good results by beating Thailand 46-29 after leading 26-10 midway. The Lankans maintained the lead and scored 20 points while conceding 19 points to the opponents in the second half. They will meet Bangladesh today.
Lankan mens beach volleyball team savoured mixed fortunes. They grabbed their first victory beating Korea 2-0 (21-15, 20-19). Asanka Medagedara and Malintha Yapa played for the Lankan team. Their second match against Thailand turned out to be a tough battle. Lankans had the early lead by scoring 25-13 in the first round, but were unable to keep the momentum as Thailand made inroads to win the second round scoring 25-21. The fiercely contested third round saw Thailand bagging victory with a score of 27-25. But Lankan head coach Tejan Dooli displayed displeasure on some of the referees decisions. Sri Lankas second game of the preliminary round is on August 23 against Vietnam.
Lankan contestants did not produce fruitful results in other sports worked off yesterday - Tennis, Weightlifting and Taekwondo events. Anika Seneviratne was downed by her Chinese opponent Zhang Shuai 1/6, 2/6, while Mariyan Angel was defeated by Kato Miyu (Japan) 0/6, 1/6 in the womens singles tennis event.
Sharmal Dissanayaka went down to Japans Uchiyama Yasutaka 0-2 in the mens tennis singles event. The doubles tennis matches against Korea (womens) and Kazakastan (mens) were also lost by Lankans 2-0.
Commonwealth Games bronze medalist weightlifter Hansani Gomes did not live up to expectations and was edged out from the competition as all her three attempts in the 48kg weight category event were unsuccessful. Thisara Dharmapriya competing among the final 32 in the 58kg weight category mens taekwondo event had no luck as his Vietnam rival beat him 11-40. The Lankan mens hockey team too was defeated by Japan 11-0.
Swimmer Akalanka Peris competing in the third race of the 50m Backstroke preliminary round clocked 26.57secs to become fourth. Even though he has recorded a much better timing previously (26.52secs) he was rushed to the Sri Lankan embassy in Indonesia soon after the event to sit for the GCE A/L English paper. Two other Sri Lankans, the Abeysinghe brothers will also compete in the 50m Backstroke event today.

SME Board; an alternative channel for SMEs to raise capital
The SME Board titled Empower, the latest listing platform, developed by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka (SEC) to encourage small and medium sector entrepreneurs to raise capital through the equity markets has received an overwhelming response from the local business community since its launch in July, this year.
The CSE has provided opportunities for large companies to list on the Main Board and Diri Savi Board, Chief Executive Officer at CSE Rajeeva Bandaranaike said in an interview with Daily News Business.
Despite the fact that SME sector accounts for a major portion of Sri Lankan economy, there is no opportunity provided for companies in the SME sector to make use of the capital market. He said. It is timely that the CSE has launched a dedicated platform to enable SMEs to make use of the capital market for capital requirements particularly to fulfill their future growth targets and expansion plans.
SME enterprises mainly fund their activities through bank financing, private equity, Venture capital, Angel investors as well as using their own wealth.
Elaborating further on CSEs involvement with this initiative, Bandaranaike emphasised that the main intention of the CSE is to provide an alternative channel for SMEs to raise capital.
We dont intend to compete with bank financing or with the investor category, but we want to compete with the service offering in the end to give an opportunity for SMEs to reduce their debt burden, convert debt to equity and develop their businesses.
So its with that in mind that CSE and SEC worked on SME platform. Were very upbeat and positive that SMEs will take this opportunity. We at CSE believe SMEs need to grow because thats a growing segment. They need capital and funding as they cant rely only on bank financing. There will come a time where they need to reduce their debt burden, convert debt into equity. Thats the time they will look at equity financing, He said. Im not saying all SMEs can qualify for this. However, they need to be ready to raise public funds.
According to Bandaranaike, for SMEs to raise public funds in the capital market, they need to be ready to raise money and are also required to establish minimum level of corporate governance standards to be qualified for the listing.
Commenting on key differences among the Main Board/ Diri Savi Board and the SME board in terms of listing requirements, Bandaranaike said the CSE has come up with a different set of requirements and certain obligations for SMEs to list compared to the Main Board and Diri Savi Board.
We do recognise SME companies are quite different to larger companies. So the CSE has made that distinction and SMEs will find it easy to obtain a listing and maintain a listing.
To be eligible for listing, a company should have a stated capital above Rs. 25 million and bellow Rs. 100 million at the time of listing and in an Initial Public Offering (IPO), the applicant entity should have a stated capital not less than Rs. 10 million at the date of the listing of application. The company must also be in operation at least two years immediately preceding the date of application and total assets should be of or below Rs. 600 million as at the date of the initial listing.
However, SMEs will have to submit their listing applications through a sponsor and sponsor should guide and assist SMEs in the listing process and also abide by the listing rules.
The CSE has now introduced the concept of sponsor. The sponsor is either an individual or a company. Their obligations are to help the company during the listing and post listing process.
The responsibility of the sponsor is to prepare the SME company for listing applications and for a listing. Furthermore, it is their responsibility to help the company place shares with investors and to help the company to do the Initial Public Offering (IPO) and help capital market. Bandaranaike said.
Subsequent to the issue, the sponsor is expected to advice, guide and direct the company in terms of complying with all the rules and regulations with the public listing.
Bandaranaike said further that the CSE has brought in this concept to guide and help them through the listing process because most of the time, SME companies dont have sufficient people to maintain listing when compared to larger companies.
There is always someone guiding and helping SMEs through this process and they are not alone in this endeavor. He said. Since the launch of SME platform one month ago, we have received an overwhelming response both from sponsors and as well as companies. Once we announced this, companies have been coming to us and talking to us rather than us going and talking to them.
In addition, the CSE has conducted its first forum in Anuradhapura to create awareness among general public about the importance of listing in stocks and listing on SME Board and the forum saw the participation over 50 business owners.
I think, at least 10 of them are following with us now following the forum. He said.
Furthermore, CSE is planning on conducing awareness programs for companies throughout the country and the CSE is also partnering with regional and national chambers to create awareness among business communities to this end.
We are also talking to prospective sponsors, potential institutions that can come and obtain approval as sponsors.
To this end, the CSE has recently conducted a forum for Chartered Accountants where professionals could act as sponsors.
In addition, the CSE is in discussions with a number of prospective sponsors in this regard.
He further said successive governments have been trying to encourage the SME sector by introducing numerous proposals to develop the sector and CSEs SME Board has also been introduced in keeping with the national need of promoting the SME sector.
He added that the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has also gone a long way in developing their SME platform quite successfully with more than 150 companies listing on the platform. In addition, BSE has gone to the extent of establishing an incubator for startups as well.
They are in a very advanced stage. We have learned from them. He said. For our own platform, we have taken some ideas from those jurisdictions as well.

Death donation fund and insurance scheme for boxers among key objectives
Sri Lankan boxing veterans come out of retirement to form association
It is a truism that old soldiers never die, they just fade away. Similarly it could be said that sportsmen in general and boxers in particular refuse to retire literally and always harbour an ambition to give back something to the sport which brought them glory during their hey days.
In a magnanimous gesture of chivalry, a group of past Sri Lankan boxers have got together to form an association with the noble objective of looking into the welfare of boxers who may need assistance long after they have hung up their gloves.
The inaugural committee meeting of the Sri Lanka Veteran Boxers Association will be held on Thursday 24th August commencing at 6.00 pm at the Bloomfield Cricket and Athletic Club grounds. We have formed a 21-member committee to work out details such as drafting a constitution for the association in keeping with our objectives, said Major Mahinda Hettiarachchi, a seven-time Stubbs Shield winner and live wire of this historic initiative which may be a first in Sri Lanka.
Former Thurstan College boxing captain Dushantha Kiriella is the man behind this noble concept born out of his idea to have a small get together of former boxers. Having been occupied in Bangladesh for nearly 30 years rising to become a top manager in the garments industry, he obviously missed the camaraderie in a sport which saw him not only captain his school but also represent the country during a tour of India in 1978, Hettiarachchi said of his former school mate.
The result was an unprecedented gathering of the boxing fraternity in the country at a grand ceremony held at the Army Cantonment in Panagoda in April. Former Army Commander General Jagath Jayasuriya, winner of the coveted Senior Best Boxers award at the Stubbs Shield Championship, graced the occasion as chief guest with Rohan Pallewatte, a leading entrepreneur being the Guest of Honour.
The highlight of the event was the felicitation of eight people in special recognition of their services to boxing. They were Brig. Rajitha Ampemohotti, a former Royal boxing captain and war hero; Priantha Malavi, a long-time cornerman and technical assistant of Royal College boxing team; Olympian DIG (retd) Sumith Liyanage; veteran coach U.A.T. Sumanapala; oldest living national champion K.V. Dharmadasa; Indradasa Jayasinghe; Dr. L.P.V. Jayaweera, an Olympic poolist who was Chairman of the Boxing Medical Commission at the 8th and 9th Asian Games; and Mrs. Philomena Wijesuriya, the first woman boxing official in Sri Lanka.
It was a tremendous success and well appreciated by everyone who urged us to form an association of veteran boxers in Sri Lanka. Kiriella has consented to be the president of Sri Lanka Past Boxers Association for which we selected 21 boxers to form the inaugural committee, said Hettiarachchi, a former President of the Sri Lanka Amateur Boxers Coaches Association. He will have Nalin Jayasinghe, a former Army boxer, as Assistant Secretary.
SSP Lionel Gunathilake, a Stubbs Shield winner for St. Sylvesters College, Kandy, will be the First Vice-President, while Captain Sumith Fonseka, a Stubbs Shield champion from Vidyartha, will be the Second Vice-President.
Former Army boxer K.H.D. Jagath Chandra will be the Treasurer and M. Premaratne, an old boy of Sri Sangaraja MMV, the Assistant Treasurer.
Among the committee members are M.S.M. Imtiyaz, who represented Hameed Al Husseiniya; Paul Luke Outschoorn, a former Royal College boxer; Trinity Lion Ikram Odayar, who won the Senior Best Boxers award at the Stubbs Shield and also represented Sri Lanka in rugby; Kevin de Rose, an outstanding product of Carey College; and former national champions from St. Mathews College, Dematagoda, W.M. Chithrananda and D.J. Neththikumara.
Hettiarachchi said that the founding committee members of the Sri Lanka Veteran Boxers Association are not presently involved in boxing administration. We are not here to rival the main bodies governing boxing in the country. Our aim is mainly to look after the welfare of past boxers, assist in the development of school and national boxing, help up and coming boxers and more importantly launch an insurance scheme for past boxers in addition to a death donation fund, said Hettiarachchi, former National champion who holds the distinction of being one of the youngest officials when he served as Secretary of the Amateur Boxing Association of Sri Lanka from 1996 to 98.
Veteran boxers who have represented school or club and wish to join this Association should contact Major Mahinda Hettiarachchi on 0714321177.

Take a deep breath - India suffer first kabaddi defeat
JAKARTA, Monday: Indias men suffered their first ever kabaddi defeat at the Asian Games when they slumped 24-23 to South Korea in a group match on Monday.
The seven-time champions beat both Bangladesh and Sri Lanka on Sunday to stamp their authority but they met their match in South Korea, ending a run of 32 straight wins.
India have only lost once before in the home-grown, breath-holding sport, after they went down to the same opponents at the 2016 World Cup.

Thieves steal cash, jewellery, while looking for Buddha statue
A group of men in Girandurukotte recently robbed jewellery and money to the value of Rs.53,000 from a house, under the ruse of searching for a gold Buddha statue and accusing the family living there of hiding it.
The men had rushed into the house in Millaththawa, Hangurankethayaya and after tying the members of the family, searched the entire house for the statue.
They had made the two children kneel down near their parents. One man remained to guard the four family members, while the rest searched the house demanding the gold Buddha statue, while threatening the head of the house with death.
Police said that the woman of the house said that they could identify the one who was guarding them, but the rest had their faces covered. The head of the house said that he woke up hearing a bang on the door and he suspected it to be an elephant.
Then the thieves broke in and tied him and his wife who followed him to find out what the noise was about. The thieves then brought the children there and made them kneel.
They demanded a gold Buddha statue which we knew nothing about, the man said. They said we were hiding it and threatened us with death. They searched the house and took money and jewellery away.
When we called the police, they came within 30 minutes. The chief inspector of the Girandurukotte Police said that there were several such robberies in the area. The police said they would use police dogs to apprehend the thieves.

Tot talk!
One mum has found an adorable way to celebrate powerful women through history: by dressing her baby daughter up as them.
Jenelle Wexler spends her time sewing teeny outfits for four-month-old Liberty Jaine Wexler, all so she can dress up as inspiring women from Cleopatra to Audrey Hepburn.
I first came up with the idea to shoot Liberty as Frida Kahlo as I thought the two had similar physical features, says Jenelle.
The shots came out wonderfully, and it was soon after that I thought about other women in history that have contributed to the betterment of women and people as a whole. I feel it is important to try and keep the types of traits these women portrayed. It exemplifies accomplishment through intellect, courage, athletic ability, and a multitude of traits I hope I can teach my children. Once I decide which woman I would like Liberty to portray, I then research the person, create a blurb that describes some of the historic accomplishments this female has attained. I go through photos of the individual and brainstorm to create costume and background design that best reflects this female.
When Liberty is older, shell be able to look back at the photos, read the blurbs her mum has created, and learn about brilliant women. So far shes dressed as 34 different women, including Malala, Hillary Clinton, and Marie Curie.
As shes a baby, Liberty does take some time to photograph (shockingly, babies dont know how to smile directly into the camera). Jenelle starts her day at five in the morning and spends around 20 minutes photographing Libertys outfits, taking around 50 shots.
I usually dress her first thing in the morning as she is in good spirits and happy to participate, explains Jenelle.
I try to catch natural light coming from our south facing windows. You can catch me laying props at five am as my husband is grabbing his coffee and running out the door to fight the rush hour traffic. I take all the photographs myself on my iPhone.
Jenelle hopes that the project will ensure her daughter and her two-year-old son, River, grow up appreciating the impact women have had in the world.
She says, I have Liberty debuting as some wonderful women of history, they were brave, strong, entertaining, sincere, and loving and have made such poise impacts on the lives of women of today. This project is a great family experience. Not only does it get my husband involved by getting Liberty to smile, it also is peaking Rivers interest. He is always asking me who is Liberty going to be next Or Who is Anne Frank I am happy to see him taking interest in such important historical figures. I am proud to say Liberty is surrounded by strong independent hardworking women, I can only hope she aspires to be one herself. Its times like these we need more of the types of women in the world. I just want to shine a light with Libertys help on people we should truly respect in our society. There are so many empowering women who need to be celebrated and have their stories told.

Train fare increase mooted
Train fares will be increased this year, but, there is no final decision yet on whether the fare will be increased from September or October, a Sri Lanka Railways Spokesman said.
He further said that train fares have not been increased since 2008. Train fares are always lower than bus fares which were increased several times in the recent past. Therefore, we expect this would be a positive move, he added.
The Railway Department, instead, will focus on reducing the operational cost to overcome losses, the Spokesman said.
We have to increase the revenue generated via tickets to address this issue. The minimum railway fare is still remains at Rs.10 considering the requirements of the middle-class and poor people, he said.
However, the fare hike will not affect the current minimum fare, the Spokesman added.
A five-member Committee headed by the General Manager of Railways was recently appointed to consider a revision of railway ticket prices.
A proposal was put forward by the Committee to amend the railway fares, taking into consideration the cost of fuel, bus fares and the losses incurred by the Sri Lanka Railways.

Vibrant  and  versatile
Young Stephanie Sansoni is fast making a name for herself as a versatile and gifted songstress in the music industry in Sri Lanka. For Sansoni it is all about hard work coupled with talent. Melodies features Sansoni, whose passion for music will help her reach great heights.
Commitment to what she does is no doubt a reason for her accomplishments in music. She is also loyal to her fans by trying her utmost to maintain her high standards.
I attribute it all to hard work and consistency. Ever since I started my music journey three years ago, I have been consistent with my video uploads and I always try my best to produce good content, said Sansoni.
Music is very much a part of her vibrant personality. Her talent for the guitar together with her voice has enabled her to endear herself to any audience that can appreciate good music.
I am genuinely passionate about music. It runs in my blood. Singing and playing guitar is my hobby and I was able to turn it into something much bigger. Music has transformed me into this whole new different person, in a good way of course, pointed out Sansoni.
Having a great voice and talent, it is only natural that she will want to put out some originals of her own. It will be part of her already incredible journey in music.
Yes definitely. I have started work on my originals. However, I am taking my time with it since I am busy with studies too. I am hoping to release an original by the end of this year, said Sansoni.
Sansoni cannot forget her fans. Their support and adulation is key to her journey. They are her greatest inspiration and reason for what she has achieved so far. Different artistes inspire her but it is her fans that are the wind beneath her wings. To hear them connect with her music and to hear them enjoy her music must be an indescribable sweetness to her. Indeed this is the dream of any successful singer or songstress to see the crowd responding to the music. To have them bolster your confidence is something only a musician can understand. A performer is lifted up seeing the excitement he or she generates in the crowd.
Sansoni is modest saying that someday she will be successful. She has the confidence and she has what it takes to make success. She loves what she does and that is her message to anyone. To do what they love. She believes that if you are passionate about what you do, then everything will fall into place. This is the key to prospering in life. Once you find what you love doing, life is a joy. Though she has a lot to learn she is learning. Success is around the corner for this young lady.
I started my journey three years ago. In 2016 to be exact. Of course there were so many obstacles. The biggest one was having to figure out so many things about social media on my own. Social media is always changing, so I had to constantly stay alert about new trends and adapt accordingly. If I hadnt taken that into consideration, my YouTube channel and Instagram profile wouldnt have grown this much, explained Sansoni.
Having the freedom to pursue what she loves to do is no doubt a contributing factor to her happiness in life. She has a support system that has allowed her to explore her strengths. She has come a long way and right throughout her friends and family have been with her providing that much needed boost.
I wish to thank my family and friends for supporting my choices in life. They are my biggest strength. A big thank you also goes to my followers and fans. I wouldnt have come this far without their support, added Sansoni.
Currently she is an undergraduate at the University of Colombo studying International Relations. Though it is challenging she feels that she will be able to balance her passion and work. It may be tough at first but when you love what you do then doors open for you. Music has done so much for her and it is part of her. It is her calling in life.
I hope to complete my studies and pursue a career related to my field. Music remains a priority too. I hope to balance both work and music and lets see where it will take me, said Sansoni.
One poem that describes her and her journey in life is called Timeless by Rupi Kaur.
my twenties are the warm-up
for what im really about to do
wait till you see me in my thirties
now that will be a proper introduction
to the nasty, wild, woman in me.
how can i leave before the partys started
rehearsals begin at forty
I ripen with age
I do not come with an expiration date
and now
for the main event
curtains up at fifty
lets begin the show,
Sansoni has a bunch of favorite artistes. But at the top of the list you get the incredible Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift. Sansoni has grown up listening to their music. These are two artistes that she looks up to.
Layla by Eric Clapton is my all-time favorite song. There is no specific reason as to why I love it. I was just drawn to it the first time I heard it a very long time ago. I never get sick of listening to this song, states Sansoni.
Sansoni calls herself as more of an extrovert. She is talkative, outgoing and forward. She is also determined and sure of herself. If she wants something nothing can deter her. However she does not like loud crowds and surrounds herself with a small yet intimate group of friends.
Sansoni has never disappointed her audience. She has performed at several concerts and corporate events and the response has been very positive and satisfying. So far it has been good and it is getting better and better. Throughout the years she has matured and refined her skills.
My favorite performance was the one at Dialog Ngage. I had such good response from the audience. I think that was the day I lost my stage fright.
There have been many great times in my musical career. My covers of Shape of You and Despacito going international, a few of my Sinhala covers generating more reviews than the original songs, performing for an audience of 4000 people at the Dialog Google I/O event and getting the opportunity to work with some high end brands and companies, said Sansoni.

Lancashires reply got off to a terrible start when they lost Alex Davies to a duck in the first over. After slumping to 43-3, a half century from Dane Vilas (61) steadied the ship before three late wickets swung the game back in Surreys favour.
Vilas partnership with Shiv Chanderpaul (25 not out) looked set to guide Lancashire to a good score before some late-evening drama under the Oval floodlights.
Marcus Trescothick hit 95 as Somerset frustrated the Essex attack on day one of their County Championship clash at Taunton.
The former England opener was denied a second Championship ton of the season when he was caught off Australian international Peter Siddle (3-71). He shared a fourth-wicket stand of 77 with skipper Tom Abell (70) who then added 64 with Steve Davies (45). Lewis Gregory was unbeaten on 42 as the hosts reached 308-7 by stumps.
A third century of the season for Will Rhodes helped Warwickshire to a 43-run lead over Gloucestershire on day one.
Rhodes (101 not out) put on 161 for the first wicket with Dominic Sibley (65) as the hosts closed on 170-2. Earlier, the visitors were dismissed for 127 with Chris Wright taking 5-32, including two wickets in three balls.
Keith Barker (2-22) and Jeetan Patel (2-28) took two wickets each, while Chris Dent (35) was one of only five players to reach double figures. Liam Dawson and Kyle Abbott rescued Hampshire from a difficult position on day one against Nottinghamshire.
The hosts were 57-1 at lunch but Steven Mullaney (3-43) took three wickets in five balls, and off-spinner Matt Carter (3-34) got rid of James Vince for 74.
Dawson (72) and Abbott (60 not out) shared a stand of 133 to help Hampshire from 137-7 to 277 all out.
Notts then slumped to 39-4, 238 behind, as West Indies international Kraigg Brathwaite made only five on his debut. Brathwaite was one of three victims for his compatriot Fidel Edwards (3-9), while Gareth Berg got rid of Chris Nash for one.
Promotion-chasing Sussex put themselves in a good position against Derbyshire as skipper Ben Brown scored a century on day one of their Division Two clash.
After electing to bowl at Hove, the visitors made a decent start and reduced Sussex to 65-3. Harry Finch (82) and Brown helped the hosts recover after coming together at 111-4, and Brown was eventually trapped lbw by Lockie Ferguson for 116.
All-rounder David Wiese finished on 89 not out as Sussex closed on 400-7. Derbyshire will have concerns over bowler Ravi Rampaul, who went to hospital for a precautionary check-up after leaving the field with breathing problems during the evening session.
Durham finished day one in Cardiff on top as they reached 79-0 in reply to Glamorgans 154 all out.
The visitors seamers were nearly always in control with Chris Rushworth (3-36) the pick of the attack backed up by Matt Salisbury (3-34).
Kiran Carlson, David Lloyd and Ruaidhri Smith all passed 30 but no-one managed a substantial contribution in gloomy conditions. Debutant Alex Lees then hit 53 not out as Durham showed more application.
Ricardo Vasconcelos equalled his career-best first-class score of 140 before Northants were pegged back by Middlesex on day one at Wantage Road.
Vasconcelos shared stands of 77 with Richard Levi (41) and 63 with Steven Crook (31) to put the hosts on top. But having claimed both openers, James Harris (5-81) returned after tea to remove Rory Kleinveldt and Nathan Buck in successive balls.
The hosts, who lie second-bottom of Division Two, reached stumps at 332-8.
Leicestershire have a slight advantage going into day two of their game against Kent.
The hosts were restricted to 220 all out, with skipper Paul Horton (49) the only man to score more than 40 runs as Ivan Thomas ended with figures of 4-35. However, Kent openers Daniel Bell-Drummond (10) and Sean Dickson (15) went in the opening 10 overs.
Heino Kuhn (12) fell to Mohammad Abbas (2-22) before play was suspended for bad light with the visitors on 53-3.

Worlds largest  chess piece
Members of the World Chess Hall of Fame in Missouri built the largest chess piece in the world: a king standing at 20 feet tall.
Guinness World Records said the massive wooden sculpture, erected this year in St. Louis to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the St. Louis Chess Club, is the largest chess piece in the world, beating a 14-foot, 7-inch tall piece constructed in 2012.
The king, sculpted from African Sapele mahogany, stands in front of the World Chess Hall of Fame in the city.
The iconic king chess piece not only serves as a beacon for the St. Louis Chess Campus, but also a regional and national landmark that exemplifies St. Louis impact on the sport and art of American chess, said Brian Flowers, marketing communications coordinator for the World Chess Hall of Fame.
