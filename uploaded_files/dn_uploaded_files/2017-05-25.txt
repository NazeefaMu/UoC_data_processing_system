Hemas Cash Back helps travellers transform trash into cash
Hemas Travels, the local representative for Hogg Robinson Group (HRG), the global travel management company with representation in over 120 countries, has been appointed the official representative for the Cash Back, the VAT reclaim organisation with its Head Office in Switzerland.
Hemas is delighted to have been given the rights to market and sell the Cash Back VAT reclaim services in the local market in order to significantly reduce our clients travel costs, said Amila Gunawardana, Manager inCharge of Hemas Cash Back.
Each year, businesses in the region spend millions in VAT on services supplied in UK, Europe, Canada and Australia. It includes VAT charged on hotel accommodation, entertainment, telephone calls, travel, transportation, training, conferences, meetings and events, exhibitions, as well as other services. Recovering VAT on these types of services represents a significant cost saving when it is refunded to companies by Hemas Cash Back.
With the HemasCash Back tie-up, corporate organisations based in Sri Lanka can reclaim what is rightfully theirs in terms of VAT refunds for all travel and related costs incurred during business trips made in the above markets.
Cash Backis proud to be associated with Hemas, one of Sri Lankas largest award winning, IATA accredited travel agencies, said Jane Holmberg, Head of United Cash Back Operations.
As HRGs representative in Sri Lanka, Hemas Travels has always set the local benchmark for corporate travellers to experience the best of what any global business travel agent has to offer. This partnership is further testimony to this as HRG Sri Lanka adds to the list of reasons why they should be the corporate travel agent of choice in Sri Lanka, said Fahim Jalali, Regional Head for HRG and Cash Back across Middle East, West Asia and North Africa.
The process is simple, Hemas Cash Back simply registers each client and collects their original invoices for submission to the relevant tax authorities, providing regular updates on the status of each claim, all working to ensure that maximum refunds are reclaimed for the clients business.

Uneasy Proteas staying put despite Manchester attack
LEEDS, Wednesday: Visiting South African cricketers "are uneasy" following Monday's suicide bomb attack on a pop concert in Manchester but abandoning their tour of England is not under consideration, the team's manager has said.
Britain has increased its security threat level to "critical" from "severe" following the attack that killed 22 people at an Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena. South Africa begin their three-month tour of England with a one-day international against the hosts at Leeds on Wednesday and team manager Mohammed Moosajee admitted the players were concerned.
"As you can understand we have some genuine concerns, the players are uneasy... there was a lot of chatter at the breakfast table," Moosajee told reporters at the Headingley ground.
"I am happy to say we've had constant communications from the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board) and their security manager."There have been guarantees put in place that security arrangements will be supplemented, starting today. We're told there will be more visible police at the stadium, at practice sessions as well as the hotels we will reside at."
The Proteas, who will be eyeing their maiden global title at next month's Champions Trophy in England and Wales, sign off their tour with the final test of a four-match series in Manchester. "The hotel we will stay at when we are in Manchester for the last test match is walking distance away from where the events unfolded so there have been some genuine concerns..." Moosaji said. - Agencies

Having established a strong presence in Western Province, Central Province and Southern Province, ACCA Sri Lanka further expanded its reach to the Northern Province.
As one of the many initiatives planned by ACCA Sri Lanka in offering equal opportunities to youth in all the regions of Sri Lanka, ACCA in collaboration with K-Aims Business School held a series of workshops in each of the zones in the Jaffna region.
The workshops were conducted by leading University lecturers. The four hour workshops conducted in each zone was based on Advanced Level exam based seminars for students studying for the commerce stream to help them eventually transit on to the ACCA qualification effortlessly.
In light of the lack of resources available for students in Jaffna wanting to enter into the field of finance, this initiative was part of ACCAs efforts to give back to the community of Jaffna, by providing a platform and pathway for students to gain a globally accepted qualification such as ACCA.

An apple  on a poya day!
Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, commemorated the UN International Vesak day with its apple dansala at Bauddhaloka Mawatha Vesak Kalapaya for the seventh consecutive year. This year, the dansala featured a mural of apples to celebrate this very special Vesak celebration held in Sri Lanka under the patronage of world leaders. The mural was created from the donation of apples received from 3000+ donors. Leo Burnett contributed two apples for every apple that was donated, resulting in the distribution of nearly 10,000 apples.
The agencys Managing Director Ranil de Silva, along with a cross-section of Burnetters representing the diversity of the agency comprising people from a cross section of religions, ethnicities and agency departments came together to set up the mural and to distribute the apples to the community. Numerous people representing friends of Burnetters, the agencys business partners, clients and team members contributed apples to help create this unique mural of apples. The agencys office was also decorated with traditional Vesak lanterns and the team got together on Vesak day to light lamps to celebrate this very special day.
A part of the Leo Burnett Team
Commenting on this years Vesak celebrations, Managing Director, Leo Burnett Sri Lanka, Ranil de Silva said at the event, Vesak is an important religious festival that we are proud to jointly celebrate as a team each year. I am delighted that the diversity of people represented in the team came together once again to celebrate this important festival.
This year the mural we created with apples was a unique feature in our long-standing tradition of conducting an apple dansla for the last seven years. Apples are an important symbol of the agencys history. It is how Leo Burnett welcomed visitors to his office in Chicago 80 plus years ago.

This tradition continues at every Burnett office around the world, including our office in Colombo. Although cynics mocked that it wouldnt be too long until Leo Burnett started selling apples on the street corner instead of giving them away, the agency was able to overcome the economic uncertainty of the time and grow and thrive.
We are honoured to have the opportunity to uphold the late Leo Burnetts tradition in Sri Lanka with our apple dansala which serves as a reminder of the companys early beginning.

BRITAIN RAISES TERROR THREAT LEVEL
UK: Britain prepared to deploy soldiers at key sites on Wednesday, having raised its terror threat level to maximum after a suicide bomber massacred 22 people at a pop concert in Manchester.
Addressing the nation from her Downing Street office, Prime Minister Theresa May warned late Tuesday that a new attack may be imminent and there was a possibility of a wider group of individuals linked to this attack.
May said the threat level was being raised from severe to critical on the recommendation of the intelligence services and she was activating a plan for armed military personnel to assist police.
Her dramatic statement came after 22-year-old Salman Abedi, a Briton of Libyan descent, was identified as the perpetrator behind Mondays deadly attack at a concert by teen idol Ariana Grande.
The Islamic State jihadist group claimed responsibility for the carnage, which was condemned by world leaders including US President Donald Trump, who branded people carrying out atrocities evil losers.
Police said soldiers would initially be on guard duties at fixed points and could also be sent to patrol transport hubs, concerts and sports events.
The plan, which has never before been used and is codenamed Operation Temperer, was first revealed after the November 2015 Paris terror attacks and is believed to allow up to 5,000 troops to be deployed.
British media said Abedi was born in Manchester, northwest England, and that his Libyan parents had fled the regime of dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
Police staged an armed raid on a Manchester address believed to be where Abedi lived, carrying out a controlled explosion to gain entry after arresting a 23-year-old man earlier Tuesday as part of the investigation.
Abedi was reported to be a former business student who dropped out of university and turned to radical Islam.
Britains best-selling newspaper The Sun carried pictures Wednesday of eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos, who was killed in the attack, and of Abedi under the words PURE and EVIL respectively.
Mondays attack came just over two weeks before Britain votes in a general election and campaigning was suspended by all the main political parties.
It is the latest in a series of deadly incidents across Europe claimed by IS jihadists that have coincided with an offensive on IS redoubts in Syria and Iraq carried out by US, British and other Western forces.
Threatening more attacks, IS said in a statement published on its social media channels: One of the caliphates soldiers placed bombs among the crowds.
The suicide bombing came at the conclusion of Grandes concert at the 21,000-capacity Manchester Arena, one of Europes largest indoor venues.
Witnesses described the horror when the bomber blew himself up outside one of the exits as the mostly youthful audience was leaving, with many parents waiting outside to collect their children.
Some 59 people were taken to hospital, many with life-threatening conditions. Twelve of them were aged under 16. Witnesses reported seeing bodies on the floor after the blast around 10:30pm (2130 GMT) on Monday, and some fans were trampled as panicked crowds tried to flee the venue.
Families were separated, with dozens of young people taken to nearby hotels overnight, and some parents were still desperately searching for their children on Tuesday.
Im just hearing nothing -- her phones dead, Charlotte Campbell, whose 15-year-old daughter Olivia was at the concert, told BBC radio.
In the city centre, thousands gathered for a multi-faith vigil outside the Town Hall to remember the victims, with defiant chants of Manchester! Manchester! ringing around.
Poet Tony Walsh recalled the citys history in a poem entitled This Is The Place, which drew huge cheers as he recounted the gritty attitude that made the city a heartland of industrial and cultural creativity.
In a poignant moment he referred to the Mancunian way to survive and said: In the face of a challenge we always stand tall. - AFP

Chelsea cancel victory parade after Manchester bomb attack
LONDON , Wednesday: Chelsea have cancelled a planned victory parade in London on Sunday in light of Monday's bomb attack in Manchester.
Antonio Conte's side won the Premier League title and could claim the double by winning Saturday's FA Cup at Wembley. Thousands of fans were expected to turn out for the parade.
"In light of these tragic events, we feel it is inappropriate to go ahead with the victory parade in London on Sunday," the club said in a statement.
"Given the heightened security threat announced by the (British) government, and recognising that this is a developing situation, we have given this careful consideration," it said.
"We strongly believe, in the interests of everyone, this is the correct course of action. We are sure our fans will understand this decision."
The club said black armbands would be worn by the players in Saturday's final against Arsenal and that a donation would be made to a fund supporting the victims.
An Islamist suicide bomber blew himself up and killed 22 people at a packed pop concert at Manchester Arena on Monday.
On Tuesday Prime Minister Theresa May's government announced that the security threat level had been raised to "critical" as the bomber, Salman Abedi, had probably not acted alone. - Agencies

Why privatisation matters
I am sending these views and comments on the Citizens Mail by Prof Deepal Mathew.
The NCMC issue started in 1986 after the buffoons of the Board of Governors at the NCMC insisted on the NCMC students being granted a Colombo Degree, just because a Dean in the Medical Faculty Prof Daphne Attygala was very tolerant and the lectures given by the Colombo Faculty staff in the Pre Clinical & Para Clinical subjects and the NCMC students sat for the common exams with the Colombo students.
The agitation started with the Medical Students and some lecturers protested about this proposal and this became a big issue and the JVP got involved and the GMOA and GDSA joined hands with them and the universities closed down for nearly three years. The President Premadasa had no option but to take over NCMC and make it the Ragama Medical Faculty which started functioning in 1991.
Sri Lanka needs much more doctors, I fully agree that they should be competent and properly trained doctors. The NCMC the first Private Medical College in the country produced around 800 very competent and caring doctors who are holding top consultant posts and academic posts in the universities in this country and in many foreign countries.
I will give you the following correct statistics from various part of the world;
1. A small island like Cuba which has a population of 11.5Mn has 74000 doctors, a ratio of 6.5 per 1000, with 21 Medical Faculties and they take top place in the whole world.
2. Singapore population 5.5Mn, has 18000 doctors,
3. India ratio 0.7 per 1000
4. UK ratio 2.8 per 1000 this is the lowest in the European Union region

6. USA ratio 2.45 per 1000
7. China ratio 1.8 - 1000
8. Japan ratio 2.5 - 1000
9. European countries have a ratio between 3 and 5 per 1000, Austria leading with 5 - 1000
10. Sri Lanka has population 2.2 Mn, 20,000 doctors, ratio 1- 1000 with 8 state faculties
If a small Island like Cuba which like Sri Lanka has Free Education and Free Health services can have 21 Medical faculties , for a population of 11.5Mn , Why can't Sri Lanka , with double that population have at least 20 Medical Faculties in the country As the state can't provide, we should like Malaysia which has 17 Private Medical faculties in the country do the same here in this country, WHO is insisting that we should increase to 2-1000. This requires a minimum of 20,000 more doctors immediately, I leave it to the public to realize how this can be achieved within the next 5-10 years.

Cricket great Tendulkar's life brought to silver screen
Mumbai: A hotly anticipated film about the life of Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar hits cinemas this week but the batting great says he might find watching it an unsettling experience.
"I am used to seeing myself on a big screen inside the stadium, not inside a movie theatre," Tendulkar told AFP ahead of Friday's release of "Sachin: A Billion Dreams"
The docudrama, directed by Emmy-nominated British filmmaker James Erskine, took four years to make and traces Tendulkar's life from aspiring cricketer to arguably the greatest batsman of all time.
It features real footage, including clips from his matches and interviews with colleagues and family and present day stars including Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
It uses actors to recreate some scenes from the 44-year-old's childhood in Mumbai.
Tendulkar, who played 200 Test matches and enjoys an almost god-like status in cricket-mad India, consented to the biopic but admitted that letting the cameras into his family life didn't come naturally.
"Being a private person I always believed I should let my bat do the talking, stay focused on the game and give all my energy over there," said the "Little Master" in an interview.
"There are personal moments in the film and some family footage. I know fans want to see something more than what they have in the last 24 years.
"Nobody knows what was going on in my mind at that time so we have spoken a lot about highs and lows and the line between me, my family and fans," he added.
The right-hander made his debut for India aged just 16 in 1989 and broke almost every batting record possible before retiring from professional cricket in 2013.
The former Indian captain is the only cricketer to have scored 100 international centuries and is the highest run scorer in international cricket with more than 34,000 runs.
Tendulkar published his autobiography in 2014 and there isn't much that cricket fans don't know about him.
But Erskine, who has made several acclaimed sports films, insists the docudrama will reveal new aspects about his life.
"You might know the stats, you might know how he performed in certain matches, but you don't know what happens when he goes off-stage, in his house -- his private life, his hopes, dreams, his highs and sorrows," he told AFP.
"You know little of his family except perhaps their names. This film really is the story of the man, and while cricket is a huge part of his life, it is just one chapter," Erskine added.
The Brit has made a number of well-received sports biopics including "The Battle of the Sexes", about a tennis match between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, and "Pantani: The Accidental Death of a Cyclist", about Tour de France winner Marco Pantani.
He also made "One Night in Turin", a documentary about England's run to the semi-finals of the 1990 football World Cup.
"Sachin: A Billion Dreams" is being produced by a company called "200 NotOut", a reference to the number of Tests Tendulkar played, leaving some movie critics wondering if the film will be little more than hagiography.
"My purpose was to make a film exploring three clear strands -- how did this boy become perceived as a god, who is the real man behind the god, how was Sachin's journey (and iconic status) a result of the massive shifts in Indian culture, cricket and media over the past 30 years.
"The last of these I treat subtly and through imagery so that it's more felt than thought. And that's key to understanding the film," said Erskine. AFP

Daughter demands Rs.75,000 from mother to handover fathers body
A shocking story of a daughter allegedly demanding Rs. 75,000 from her mother to handover the body of her father who died recently is reported from Warawewa, Giribawa.
The father who died was a resident of Bentara. The daughter who is married and settled down in Girbawa had visited her parents in Bentara with her husband. Her father had fallen ill and was hospitalised. When the father was discharged from hospital the daughter had taken the father under her care and taken him to her residence in Warawewa since his health was deteriorating.
However, the father had died on May 20 and the daughter had arranged his funeral at Warawewa without informing her mother or relatives.
The mother who came to know about her husbands death had made a bee-line to the daughters house in Warawewa hoping to stage the funeral at their home town of Bentara. When the mother arrived at the daughters house, she had found out that her husbands funeral arrangements, including the Pansakula ceremony had been finalised by the daughter at Warawewa.
When the mother demanded that the body be taken to Bentara, the daughter had demanded Rs.75,000 from her saying she had already spent the money on the funeral arrangements after receiving it as a donation from the death donation society in the area. However, the relatives who accompanied the mother had complained to the Giribawa Police about the tussle between the daughter and mother. Police soon arrived at the daughters house and took steps to handover the body to the legal wife without any payment to the daughter. During the Police inquiry the daughter had accused her mother and relatives in Bentara of neglecting her father during his lifetime and were now demanding his body with an eye on his pension.

Donald Trump play-acts peace in the Middle East
For a president mired in scandal at home, Donald Trumps first foreign tour has proved a welcome distraction. His speech at Israels national museum on Tuesday was punctuated frequently with lusty applause from a crowd stocked with longtime supporters. Maybe hell just decide to stay overseas for good, joked one U.S. Embassy staffer at the event.
The warm welcome was not a foregone conclusion. Trumps Israeli supporters spent the past four months with a constant case of whiplash. On the campaign trail, the president often promised to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Press Secretary Sean Spicer also declined to condemn a spurt of new Israeli settlement construction days after the inauguration.
The pro-settler right was jubilant  but the euphoria wouldnt last. In his first meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump asked the Israeli leader to hold back on further building in the occupied territories. Then in the weeks that followed, administration officials took the embassy move off the table, and Trump spoke with optimism about striking the ultimate deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
Joy quickly turned to despair, and Israeli hawks started to attack Netanyahu for allegedly blowing Israels best opportunity to change Americas long-standing support for Palestinian statehood.
I dont believe that Trump came with this huge vision of a two-state solution, Naftali Bennett, the head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, told Foreign Policy. I think weve been inviting these pressures.
But Netanyahu does have a strategy to deal with Trump, and it is slowly starting to bear fruit. Notably, Trump declined to pressure Israel in any way in his national museum speech, which focused almost entirely on Iran and global terrorism. Netanyahu is playing a long game, according to advisors and diplomats  and already the Trump administrations policies have shifted in a direction beneficial to the Israeli prime minister.
Trumps first visit to Israel
Until January, Netanyahu had only worked with Democratic presidents  and his relationships with both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were turbulent, to say the least. A furious Clinton once emerged from a meeting with Bibi and asked: Whos the f...... superpower here Netanyahu now has an asset he has never enjoyed during his time in power  a solicitous ear in the White House and a Republican-controlled Congress.
The Israeli prime minister, however, knows that Trump is mercurial. So he has laid on the charm for the presidents first visit to Israel, ordering his entire Cabinet to attend the welcome ceremony on Monday. He also looked mortified when a Likud backbencher (also, reportedly, a former pimp) grabbed Trump for a selfie. Later that evening, he invited the Trumps for dinner at the official residence, where he presented them with a 19th-century Bible. Trump called the meal unforgettable.
The Palestinians also thought they had made a good impression with Trump. Trump warmly received Mahmoud Abbas at the White House earlier this month; the rulers of Egypt and Jordan, two close allies, also made the case for Palestinian statehood during their own Oval Office chats.
However, Trump has so far dashed their hopes that his administration plans to increase pressure on Netanyahu to issue a settlement freeze and publicly endorse the two-state solution. In fact, the Trump administration appears to be moving in the opposite direction: Trump made six public statements during his 28 hours in the Holy Land  but not once did he utter the words two-state solution. The Israelis took note.
As Mohammad Shtayyeh, a member of Fatahs central committee, admitted, Trump is an unpredictable man. There has been little serious talk of a settlement freeze, a step that would infuriate Netanyahus far-right coalition. Nor has Trump clarified his views after declaring, at his first meeting with Netanyahu, that he was looking at two-state and one-state.
Its fine with us, from our point of view, a Netanyahu aide said before the presidents speech. Since he came into office, I dont think two states has been the focus anymore  and the prime minister has always said it will be a state-minus.
Still, Trump stressed his personal commitment to ending the conflict. Even if there is no peace, there will be a process: While Trump does not plan to start with a splashy summit, he has urged both sides to take modest steps toward building trust. In his meeting with Abbas, he urged the Palestinian president to suspend his governments welfare payments to the families of imprisoned Palestinian militants.
Palestinian economy
Trumps aides have also asked Israel to bolster the Palestinian economy. The Security Cabinet on Sunday approved a few modest steps to that effect: The Israeli army will issue more building permits in Area C, the roughly two-thirds of the West Bank under full Israeli control, and the Allenby Bridge connecting the West Bank with Jordan will be open 24 hours a day, making it slightly easier for Palestinians to travel abroad.
The Gulf states, in turn, have dangled their own carrots in front of Israel in exchange for renewed peace talks with the Palestinians, like telecommunications links and overflight rights for El Al, Israels national airline.
All of this is music to Netanyahus ears. The prime minister has spent the past decade promoting a theory of economic peace, where better living conditions in the occupied territories would defuse Palestinian animosity toward Israel. The strategy has been a failure on both counts: The West Bank economy is stagnant, with official unemployment at 16 percent, and the conflict boils on. Critics say Netanyahu has adopted a stalling tactic, meant to avoid the serious work of a diplomatic settlement.
In recent years, Netanyahu has also embraced the outside-in approach to the conflict. Peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours, he argues, would also bring about a deal closer to home. The Palestinians accept this idea in public, though Abbas reminded Trump on Tuesday that any regional deal still requires a bilateral agreement.
But in private, such talk worries them. The Arab autocrats who welcomed Trump in Riyadh have their own strategic interest in closer ties with Israel, which would be a valuable ally in the regional cold war against Iran. The Arab states have let us down before, said one longtime Palestinian diplomat. I dont think they would hesitate to do it again.
Trumps top officials also do not appear emotionally or intellectually invested in this issue. Obama and George W. Bush both had secretaries of state who were deeply committed to bringing peace in the Holy Land. Trumps chief diplomat, Rex Tillerson, has evinced little interest in the conflict. He mistakenly told reporters on Monday that Tel Aviv, a secular city founded in 1909, was the home of Judaism. (Trump himself seemed a bit flummoxed by the regions geography, telling the Israeli president that we just got back from the Middle East.)
Instead, the Trump administrations efforts are being run by a small group of longtime confidantes. The U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, used to run a charity that donated millions of dollars to Beit El, one of the West Banks more ideological settlements. But Friedman only arrived this week, and his role may prove to be largely symbolic  one person who briefed Friedman said he had to explain the difference between Fatah and the PLO.
Netanyahus strategy
The real players will be Trumps special envoy, Jason Greenblatt, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Greenblatt went on a listening tour this spring and won praise for meeting a wide range of Israelis and Palestinians. He has done no interviews, though, and his personal views are a mystery. Kushner has been basically mute  on this issue and everything else in his expansive portfolio, which includes relations with China and solving the opioid crisis in the United States.
But even if Trump is deeply committed to cutting a deal, he faces an uphill slog. The Israeli government is the most conservative in decades. The schism between Fatah and Hamas has only deepened: Abbas recently cut off fuel subsidies and shipments of medicine to Gaza, steps that have raised fears of a fourth war in the blockaded enclave. Trump himself, facing investigation by a special counsel and historically low poll numbers, may not have much interest in the maps and memos that absorbed his predecessors.
If Trump loses interest, Netanyahus strategy toward the new president may be vindicated. At their dinner on Monday, Netanyahu served Trumps favourite fare: steak and chocolate cake. The only lighter option was a salmon dish. The menu dubbed it, fittingly for a fish that swims upstream, The Path to Peace. - Foreign Policy

Fairway Holdings reacts to CB Govs  comments on industry
Responding swiftly and strongly to the statement made by Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy with regard to the apartment development industry, stalwarts of the industry have said that it was irresponsible and damaging.
I know we are living in a post truth world, but some of the broad generalisations made by the Governor are excessive, precipitous and dont seem to be grounded on established facts, said Hemaka de Alwis, Chairman of Fairway Holdings.
De Alwis was reacting to the Governors claims that the apartment construction industry appeared to be overheating, was using credit lines meant for SMEs and provided a safe haven for black money.
The apartment construction sector, despite the recent removals of tax concessions, has been one of the few robust segments of an otherwise lethargic domestic economy.
The growth in the industry is driven by several factors. Despite two-thirds of the population living on one-third of the land area around the Western Province, Sri Lanka is one of the least urbanised countries in the world.
In fact Sri Lankas urbanisation rate of 20% is well behind the average for South Asia and half that of the global average. The UN World Urbanisation Index of 2011 puts Sri Lanka at 199 out of 203 countries.
In recent years however, the natural drift towards urbanisation has been intensified by a high degree of centralisation, particularly of educational institutions, around Colombo.
This combined with weak traffic management, inefficient arterial roadways and lack of an effective mass transport system has created a strong demand for vertical urban housing around Colombo.
While agreeing that there is a possible bubble in the segment identified as luxury by the governor, de Alwis said, The mid-range market is driven by solid fundamentals, underlying a gradual move towards modern city life. Sri Lanka is not an isolated case but part of a global trend towards urbanised vertical living - there is clearly no bubble, as there is no unrealistic pricing but a strong trend of demand-driven growth. Surely when the highest segment sells at double the price per square foot of the mid-range, there is every possibility of an unrealistic element in the pricing because the cost and quality base is the same  but the point is the whole industry cant all be tarred with the same brush.
Given the robust market fundamentals and short project cycle times of two to three years, banks might be disposed to favour the industry.
However, in contrast to the governors claims, the trend depicted in purchases of Fairway Apartments show that only 10% of Fairways customers use bank loans to finance their purchases, and 75% of the customers buy to live in. Both indicators suggest that people are converting existing assets into apartments to support an urban lifestyle change.
Meanwhile the World Bank has highlighted the fact that urbanisation is a vital driver of economic growth, job creation and prosperity, and it goes on to warn that a failure to address urban housing, public service and infrastructure will retard such benefits. De Alwis said, Banks not offering SMEs sufficient credit and the existence of black money are clearly financial regulatory issues. Conflating them into an apartment development issue is irresponsible and damaging.

Feeling Right
Architecture certainly can be used to evoke emotion. Interestingly enough the impact architecture can have on the human mind was explored by the poet and the horror writer Edgar Allan Poe who wrote in the 19th century. In 1839 he wrote a story- The Fall of the House of Usher where the Protagonist of the story Roderick Usher is driven to depression by the House he lived in - As I came in sight of the place, my spirits sank....as sad as the cold grey walls of the building before my eyes
Humans are sentimental creatures and one can get attached to so many physical characteristics of a space. The way the light falls and the way shadows are cast. ArchWorld meets up with Archt. Janaka Wijesundara to discuss where the heart is in architecture.
The physical (steel, concrete, glass and brick) and the forces of nature (sun and wind) combined can create so many different moods, atmospheres, interiors qualities and characteristics and ambiences. You cannot change the forces of nature (the heat outside and the light outside) all you can do is, by careful planning, designing and orientating the spaces, somehow manipulate the impact of these forces of nature. In other words you need to understand these forces and the numerous benefits it offers. In our tropical climate we can utilize them quite well, perhaps more so when compared to western climates, said Wijesundara
Light
There are so many options when it comes to light. There are so many advantages to light. You can receive the light coming in (the volume) through the careful planning of spaces.
In certain houses the ventilation is brought up through the floor/ from the bottom of the house. This makes the interior more comfortable. There is a system that allows the wind to be channeled through the openings underneath. Some of the old architecture were built on pillars to get the ventilation from the ground. So in the early periods of Sri Lankan history even before the colonial periods, because of the thought patterns, the buildings have created spaces which controlled the light, shade and wind/ ventilation in different ways, explained Wijesundara
Shadow types
We can choose various shadow types such as how we choose the shadows to fall.
You can treat the walls differently and that can cast shadows. You can create very creative shadows. Even the texture of the wall can really make a difference. The textural quality of the wall can create emotions. A house can be friendly or maybe even perhaps foreboding. When the sun moves the shadow casted could vary. The shadows could be longer and elongated and sometimes they are straight. That is one way of giving your place an identity. This can even be done by the positioning of the rooms. At the same time it gives you comfort. The shadows can even cut down on the heat, explained Wijesundara.
In any society or in any culture it is architecture that defines the culture. You may have paintings, music and dramas, but in any culture by looking at the architecture you can understand what kind of people they are. It is that important. Certain architecture never dies. It is extremely awe inspiring when you think of how architects are immortalized by their architecture.
Aesthetic aspect
If you take the Taj Mahal, it is a beautiful building. So when you take historical architecture one defining feature is the aesthetic aspect - proportions, scales and rhythms. The spaces must be created in such a way, where there is a relationship with the observer and the space. Some people say that in a mysterious way something that is inbuilt in your memory will be refreshed once you are in such a space. That is the most difficult thing for an architect to do, pointed out Wijesundara
Making the spaces generate feelings is the most difficult part in the whole process of architecture.
The communicative aspect is very important. Various messages are given through the architectural spaces. Creating communicative spaces that change your mentality is one of the most difficult things about architecture. It is like coming out of a cinema hall with a message. Then that architecture is successful, informed Wijesundara.

Fitch downgrades Kotagala to CC(lka)
Fitch Ratings Lanka has downgraded Kotagala Plantations PLCs National Long-Term rating to CC(lka) from B+(lka).
The agency has also downgraded the National Long-Term rating on Kotagalas outstanding listed senior secured debentures of Rs. 1 billion to CC(lka) from B+(lka).
The downgrade follows continued deterioration in the companys liquidity, as its operating EBITDA weakened further in the financial year ending March 2016 (FY16) due to falling tea and rubber prices, high labour costs and poor labour productivity.
Consequently, Kotagalas operating EBITDA of Rs. 30 million was insufficient to cover its borrowing costs of Rs. 503 million and the company had to utilise cash reserves to meet most of its financial obligations.

GDP growth up last year: Kabir
Although the economic growth rate had slowed down to 4.4 percent in 2016 from 5 percent in 2014, the growth in terms of GDP has actually increased last year amounting to Rs.11,839 billion from Rs.1,0361 billion in 2014, UNP General Secretary and Public Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said yesterday.In this context it is not correct to say that the economy is failing, simply going by the economic growth rate.
Addressing a media briefing at Sirikotha yesterday, the Minister said a Professor from a leading University has commented in a newspaper article that the economy has slowed down in 2016 compared to 2014. This is a wrong interpretation.
According to the Central Bank report in 2016, the service sector has grown by 4.2 percent while the industrial sector has reported a growth of 6.7 percent. The Professor has commented that the industrial sector has shown a growth due to the construction sector boom in the country.
But, this is wrong. The construction sectors contribution to the industrial sector is only 14.9 percent, the Minister stated.
We accept there is a setback in the agricultural sector. But this is also due to a very long drought experienced recently. This has resulted in the decline of the economic growth rate as well. Price of tea, rubber and coconut were also affected due to a global fall in prices. But, we have been able to increase the price of tea leaves upto Rs.90 per kilo while the price of natural rubber latex was incresed upto Rs.350 per kilo.
Compared to our economic growth rate, there is a heavy decline in other countries. Economic growth rate in USA was 1.6 percent in 2016 while it was 2.4 percent in 2014. The economic growth rates in UK and South Korea were 3.1 percent and 3.3 percent respectively in 2014 while they have declined to 1.8 percent and 2.7 percent in 2016.
There is only 11 percent reduction in the overall economic activities from 2014 to 2016 in Sri Lanka. But In India, they experience a 52 percent decline during the same period. The world economic growth rate has also reduced from 3.4 percent in 2014 to 3.1 percent in 2016.
In rupee terms, there is no fall in per capita income. But, in dollar term there is a difference due to depreciation of rupee. During the former regime, the economic benefits were enjoyed only by the rich people and there was nothing for poor. At that time 20 percent of the rich people enjoyed the 50 percent of the countrys wealth while the poor got only 4 percent.
According to the CB report, we have been able to create 120,000 new jobs last year. The unemployment problem between the youth aged 15 to 24 years arose due to the formation of Nil Balakaya during the last regime. The Nil balakaya used the youth for their political campaign without creating job opportunities for them.
Commenting on the Cabinet reshuffle, he said it is a normal turn of events under any government. It depends on the capabilities of any Minister. This is a joint decision taken by both the President and Prime Minister and another reshuffle can also take place shortly. If a Minister does not have any knowledge on the subjects assigned to him he or her should learn them. As an example former Minister Ronnie the Mel has a degree in a history. But he became one of the best Finance
Ministers of the country later under the former President J.R.Jayewardene . In the Mahinda Rajapaksa eara only three people controlled all the powerful ministries and about 70 percent of the budget was allocated to their Ministries. They even did not allow the skilled people to work. But, everybody has forgotten that past now, he added.

ICCSL welcomes Govt efforts to restore GSP+
International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL) welcomed the quick initiative taken by the government to regain GSP+ as it would pave way for duty free access to the EU market on a whole range of products.
It was in December 2009 that European Union decided to withdraw temporarily GSP+ benefits to Sri Lanka.
This decision was based on the findings of the Commission of Investigations launched in October 2008 and completed in October 2009.
In view of the report, no satisfactory progress was shown by Sri Lanka in the implementation of the three UN human rights conventions - Civil and Political Rights, Convention against Torture and Rights of the Children which were related to the granting of GSP+ benefits.
ICCSL Chairman Keerthi Gunawardane said that the present government immediately continued a dialogue with the European Union in a positive manner to restore GSP+.
The International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka appreciates the efforts of the government to restore GSP+. This can have lot of positive effects for the Sri Lankan economy.
In addition to the possibility of developing business within the EU the existing businesses can improve competitiveness and the profitability, he said. Unfortunately, there was no significant interest displayed by Sri Lanka since 2010.
This slow process caused a heavy damage mainly to the export trade with the closure of many small and medium-sized garment factories amounting to a loss over US$ 750 million of exports, he said.
In 2005, the EU introduced special incentive arrangements under the EU GSP scheme called GSP+ and the special feature of this scheme is that all the eligible products under this new scheme could be exported by selected beneficiary countries to the European Union totally free of import duty.
Developing countries and least developed countries recognised as beneficiary countries are offered preferential tariff reductions for their export products to developed countries under the GSP system.
It is a removal of partial or entire tariff charges for goods exported by beneficiary countries. Beneficiary countries are bound to adhere to certain international labour regulations and manufacture the products to compete with international standard togethers with certain percentage of value addition accepted by offer countries.

India and Chinas Tug of War over Lanka
Unnerved by growing Chinese influence in Sri Lanka, India is seeking to strengthen ties with the Colombo government through economic cooperation as the Indian Ocean island nation assumes increasing importance as a regional trading hub in one of the worlds busiest sea lanes.
In the past few weeks, Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi has met his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe in New Delhi and, more recently, in Colombo.
Modis subsequent visit to Colombo, the second since he became premier in 2014, reflected what New Delhi officials have described as qualitative transformation in bilateral ties. In recent years, Beijing has invested heavily in Sri Lankas infrastructure as part of its string of pearls policy aimed at establishing a naval presence across South Asia by building ports and other facilities in friendly countries - including Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar.
The expansion is part of its One Belt, One Road (OBOR) project, a new trade route linking China with the West, underpinned by billions of dollars of infrastructure investment.
India has been looking on nervously, concerned that China is encroaching on its sphere of influence and eroding its commercial and cultural links with the island, some of whose Tamil minority are descendants of colonial-era indentured workers from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
Sri Lankas current President Maithripala Sirisena has sought to rebalance relations with the competing regional powers, reaching out to New Delhi with Modi keen to reciprocate.
Under Sirisenas predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka looked to China for economic and diplomatic backing at a time when the West was threatening to sanction Colombo for crimes committed in its conflict with Tamil separatists.
China is the largest investor in Sri Lanka, having spent hundreds of millions of dollars repairing war-damaged infrastructure and developing new projects following the end of the civil war in 2009.
Chinese funds have been channeled into roads, airports, and sea ports, the two highest profile initiatives being the Hambantota Port Development and the Colombo Port Project. Yet the influx of capital has not been without controversy. The commercial value of some of the infrastructure projects has been questioned, while Chinese loans - with which much of the investment has been financed - have contributed to the countrys huge national debt of $64 billion, or 76 percent of GDP. Sirisena asked China to resume work at the $1.4 billion Colombo Port Project in October, although a deal to increase the commercial viability of the loss-making Hambantota facility and also help Sri Lanka generate much needed funds has been held up. Colombo is offering China an 80% stake in the port on a 99-year lease for $1.12 billion.
Negotiations have reportedly been stalled due to a dispute about plans for an adjoining 15,000-acre Chinese industrial zone, which has been opposed by locals who fear they will be evicted from their land.
The government is under pressure to resolve these issues as China, which has so far spent $1.7 billion on the port and a nearby airport, has said it will invest $5 billion to develop the area over next few years and create 100,000 jobs if everything goes well.
Notwithstanding Sri Lankan reservations over Chinese investment, Colombo is keen to keep China on board. Wickremesinghe attended a major OBOR summit in Beijing this month and aims to finalize a free trade agreement (FTA) with China this year. But, as the recent talks with Modi highlight, Sirisena also wants to bolster relations with India, which came under significant strain in the Rajapaksa era.
Indias importance to Sri Lanka is beyond question: it is the islands largest trading partner and has provided over $2.5 billion worth of development assistance. India uses the Colombo port for more than 70 percent of its shipping.
The two countries are keen to upgrade their existing FTA by signing a new trade pact called the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA), which would enhance commercial ties between Sri Lanka and Indias fast-growing southern states.
As with certain Chinese investments, some Sri Lankans are nervous about Indias economic overtures. There have been protests against the ETCA over fears that the country would lose out to Indian businesses.
For India, Trincomalee and other planned investments - which include power plants, railway line upgrades, and the creation of special economic zones - have a strong strategic value. New Delhi appears to be determined to check Chinas geopolitical ambitions in South Asia. Developing a bigger economic footprint in Sri Lanka is central to this aim. (The Diplomat)

India-Sri Lanka Shilpa Kala opens today
Sri Lanka and India will jointly showcase the strength of their traditional handicrafts and textiles at the second annual exhibition of Shilpa Kala, which formally opens today (25) in the Mihilaka Medura at the BMICH, Colombo.The exhibibition will be held from May 25 to 28
Shilpa Kala is hosted by the High Commission of India. The president of the Dastkari Haat Samiti of India and veteran handicraft curator Jaya Jaitly, and the president of the Hands of Sri Lanka Foundation and former National Crafts Council Chairman Buddhi Keerthisena have collaborated to organize the exhibition under the aegis of the Indian High Commission.
The exhibition will showcase works of some award winning craftsmen from across India and Sri Lanka. It will expose Indian fabric crafts, sari making, pattachitra, patchwork, embroidery, book binding, muslim textiles, terracotta and wood articleslambani craft, silver and mixed metal jewelryyardage, duppattas, glass work, hand woven cotton, fashion accessories, and hand block panting among other handicrafts and art forms. Sri Lanka artisan will display their share of handicrafts among them textile printing, clay productsm handloom fabric designs, batik, educational toys, ceramics, Palmyrah and Telipot cproducts, lace, traditional masks, handloom saris and natural stone art forms.
At a press conference held at Taj Samudra hotel in Colombo to announce the inauguration of the exhibition Second Secretary of Indian High Commission Niteen Subhash Yeola said they are trying to promote a partnership between India and Sri Lanka to boost the handicraft sector with the help of Jaya Jaitly and Buddhi Keerthisena. Jaitly and Keerthisena participated in the press conference.
Yeola said they expect that Sri Lankan handicraft artisans will have a wider audience in India.
Jaity said that she is not a stranger to Sri Lanka or its handicraft culture.
What bring us together is our shared culture, she said, I am so happy that the High Commission of India is hosting Shilpa Kala exhibition because usually it is the Ministry of Indian Textiles which looks after handicrafts and handlooms in India, which looks after such things.
She said that promotion of handicrafts through exhibitions such as Shilpa Kala provides an excellent platform for diplomacy at people- to- people level.She said the people in Sri Lanka who do grass- mat weaving can sit with those grass-mat weaving people in India.
There is a language they are speaking without knowing the language of each other. There is the technique they understand each other. There are new things they can teach each other, she said.
In the field of handicrafts we have often found crafts people willing to share their knowledge among each other.
In the competitive corporate world it is not so. You do not want the others to know your design or prototype. You have your own brand, she pointed out, But in our field of handicrafts, Sri Lankan handicrafts are Sri Lankan brand and it is the cultural identity of Sri Lanka. The same way we feel for India.
Average village craftsman may not be highly educated. He may not know how to reach out.I have brought an exquisite Kashmir embroidery craftsman. The sad thing is he does not know how to read and write. Others have travelled different parts of the world. We like to give them this kid of opportunityso that they have a chance to see how other countries are.
This is a very good platform to develop friendship, she added.
Buddhi Keerthisena said following the success of their first Shilpa Kala last year, the High Commission of India had decided to hold the exhibition this year.
They are funding the projects entirely, I am thankful to them. India is supporting us in a big way to promote our handicraft industry. India has a lot of handicraft programs. We have to take them to strengthen our handicraft industry, he said.
The sharing of arts and handicrafts between Sri Lanka and India dates back to era of King Ashoka of India and King Devanampiyatissa of Sri Lanka, he reflected.
Our relations in the field of art and handicrafts have stood the test of time, he said and added, It continues to enhance the strong bond between our two countries, he pointed out.

Kandy schools rugby round up
Going into the final week's rugby, St. Anthonys, Dharmaraja, Trinity, KIngswood, Vidyartha, St Sylvesters, Sri Rahula, Sri Sumangala (St. Paul's) have played their last games in the second round. Trinity College had high hopes of winning the Cup competition, but they threw it away failing to win the deciding game which was also the first leg of the Bradby Shield against Royal. Both St. Anthonys and Dharmaraja had hopes to win the Plate championship. St. Anthony's College gave a good display to beat Science College and Dharmarajah College beat Prince of Wales, both schools are with equal points but St. Anthonys are with more tries and have pocketed the Plate. Much was expected from Vidyartha but they went down to Lumbini College. Sri Sumangala playing in the Shield beat Eheliyagoda National School, Sri Rahula beat Bandaranayake MV from Gampaha in a Division II Cup competition match and St. Sylvester's beat Mahanama College in a Bowl trophy game so, the schools League curtain draws to a close and now its time for the knockouts.
St. Anthonys gave a sterling performance on Sunday to drub Science 43-17 and this win helped them to bring the Plate title to Katugastota. The knowledgeable Antonian forwards used their weight and height to win a major share of the ball from the rucks and mauls. With good ball coming their way they indulged in too many tactics to beat the Science defence. It was a treat to see the Antonians forwards and three quarters ball handling.
Trinity  The first leg of the 73rd Bradby Shield that also climaxed to become the deciding fixture of the Schools rugby league title saw royal securing a hard fought victory over Trinity in Kandy. This win for Royal will be a historic achievement as this encounter also got them the most important league title by outplaying Trinity 22-17. Royal were presented the Cup as the 2017 champion team.
Trinitys defeat was due to poor tackling, losing most of the rucks and mauls, scrums and line outs. Although they started with a bang in the first 10 minutes they gradually faded away with pressure from the Royalist. This attributed to ineffective leadership and the captain playing in the wrong position and failing to lead from upfront. The three quarters failed to perform to expectation and allowed their opposite numbers to run through them. The halves combination clicked well except under pressure, fly half Lashan Wijesuriya had an excellent game gaining ground with his calculated kicks to touch. Lashan also scored a brilliant try running 25 meters and taking three defenders with him before scoring the try which he converted. There is a general perception among many rugby fans that losing is not a big setback, but most fans like to witness a good game. Last Saturday's game was very clean with no fisticuffs, no yellow cards, no warnings by the referee etc. A very good rugby game was witnessed by a huge crowd from both schools, the only hassle was the traffic, car parking was the issue and even after 8.30 pm most of the spectators were waiting for their turn to take their respective cars out from the park. Fans are hoping to see some trademark Trinity flair in the 2nd leg of the Bradby Shield clash in Colombo on the 3 June.
Dharmaraja were aiming for the Plate championship, if they had more tries they had the chance, in the last game where they beat Prince of Wales. They needed to score 15 tries. Although Rajan's dominated play against Prince of Wales they scored only 66 points against 5.
It was a treat see the Rajans three-quarters running the ball whenever they were in possession.What made the Rajans click is their dedication to the game and the desire to win which they did and led 47-5 at half time. The second half saw the Rajans forwards keeping the ball with them and fashioning the moves.
Kingswood who was relegated last season from the top division has gone back to the division they were in. In their last game they beat D.S. Senanayake at Welisara by 17 points to 12. Thanks to the good work of their prop forward whose try helped them to win this game.
From the first whistle both sides ran the ball with their three-quarters and the exchanges were even. At half time D.S led 7-5. The second half turned out to be a tense one where the two sides were engaged in a life and death struggle to score points. A try from Chandraratne helped the Kingswoodians win.
St. Sylvesters beat Mahanama by 20 points to 14. The winners showed a lot of promise maintaining their high stakes.
Exchanges were even and at the start Sylvestrians looked very dangerous, but as the game progressed Mahanama players settled down to some heady rugby and began exploiting the home teams mistakes. St. Sylvesters is a school with limited facilities and they play matches without proper practices.
Sri Sumangala played a good game of rugby to beat Eheliyagoda National School 63-0 at the Campus grounds Peradeniya. Sri Sumangala started the game with a bang and went into scoring a few minutes from the first whistle. The winners led 33-0 at half time. The match commenced at 2 pm due to ground having to be handed over to the authorities by 4.
Sri Rahula playing in Division II Cup competition beat Bandaranayake MV from Gampaha in their Division II Cup competition match which was played at the Peradeniya Campus grounds at 2.30 p.m. Sri Rahula played a good game, and their rugby has really improved. On Tuesday they lost to Vidyaloka Galle 39-0 at Koggolla.
Vidyartha played their last game on Wednesday with Lumbini at Thurstan College grounds. The match began with exchanges even and Lumbini looked very dangerous, but as the game progressed Vidyartha settled down to play some heady rugby and began exploiting the oppositions mistakes and won by 36 points to 25.

Kohli wants to win CT without losing a game
India will be looking to retain the ICC Champions Trophy without losing any matches and the only thing that matters to skipper Virat Kohli is to win matches for India.
"I would never play for redemption, my only motivation is to keep winning games for my country and doesn't matter the conditions I am playing in, it might be in sub-continent, it might be England, Australia, South Africa, the aim always is to win games and I am willing to do whatever I can to be able to achieve that for the team," Kohli said at the press conference before the team's departure for the tournament.
"People might look at it redemption, opportunity or stuff like that but in my head I don't think of those things at all, for me it's a game of cricket played anywhere in the world," the Indian skipper added.
He believes that the standard of competition in the Champions Trophy is higher than World Cup. The Indian captain was answering a question which related to his poor run in the recently-concluded Indian Premier League (IPL).
Kohli had a fairly indifferent IPL, with 308 runs from the 10 innings he played after recovering from an injury he picked up during the Australia series.
His display included four half-centuries, which by his standards was a rather poor show, given his standards -- he had four consecutive centuries in IPL 9.
The Kohli-led Royal Challengers Bangalore ended at the bottom of the table and were dumped out of the tournament at the end of the league stage. They managed to win just three of their 14 league matches, the third win coming in their last match last match, against Delhi Daredevils.
"We want to win it without losing a game," Kohli said. "We have to be at top of our game from Ball 1."
India begin their campaign against arch-rivals Pakistan at Edgbaston on June 4. Kohli said that his sole ambition is to win matches for India.
"If players don't do well in India and then go back, there is no hype around it, you don't do well away from India it is like a knife hanging on your neck, so I don't believe in those things.
"India, Pakistan game is always exciting but for us it is a game of cricket," Kohli said. "The hype around India-Pakistan game not always in our control," he added.
Kohli said that the presence of players like Mahendra Singh Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh in the squad only added to it.
"If given freedom, Dhoni and Yuvraj know how to bring their experience into play," he added. The tournament begins on June 1.
India have two practice matches to play ahead of the tournament proper, against New Zealand and Bangladesh.  NDTV

Mangala to introduce a new wave of reforms to boost economy
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said he will bring in a new wave of reforms which will take Sri Lanka forward as a modern, dynamic and democratic economy.
The minister in his first speech in Parliament said his target is to ensure that the country becomes the hub of the Indian Ocean by 2020. On resurrecting the economy, Minister Samaraweera said the private sector should be the engine of growth and its contribution was vital for development.
Financial discipline was ruined due to crony capitalism and dictatorial rule. For the last two years, my predecessor under the leadership of the Prime Minister went to great efforts to put the economy back on the right track.
We regained the confidence of the international community. Our leaders are well-received anywhere they go in the world, he said. The minister also said that extremism and corruption should be wiped out to achieve economic prosperity and promised to put his maximum effort to rebuild the debt-ridden economy.

More Lankan companies deploy Cobots by Universal Robots
Universal Robots, the pioneers in the manufacturing of advanced, user-friendly and lightweight collaborative robotic arms, (headquartered in Odense, Denmark) perceives huge demand in the Sri Lankan market.
Several Sri Lankan companies have purchased Cobots by Universal Robots to boost industrial productivity mainly in the apparel and packaging industries.
After the successful launch of the Sri Lanka operations in 2016, the company deployed collaborative robots (popularly known as cobots), majorly in the market sectors of FMCG and and apparel and other sectors such as rubber gloves.
With the growing demand of collaborative robots in the country, the company is also looking at expanding its customer base in various other sectors.
Ceylon Biscuits was our latest customer and both UniLever and Hemas Group too have shown keen interest, Pradeep David, General Manager, Sri Lanka said.
The company hopes that this can help Sri Lanka with the problem of scarcity of labour to a large extent. Handling of our cobots doesnt require any prior qualifications and certificates.
Some of our Indian customers like Bajaj Auto and Aurolabs have hired 80% of women employees, who are conveniently working with cobots, where physically challenging parts of the jobs are taken care of by cobots.
We are hoping to replicate the same in Sri Lanka by creating interesting occupations categories such as machine operators and supervisors that would surely increase the willingness of women here to take up those jobs.
He said that they will also provide more employment for graduates in a bid to meet the increasing demands in Sri Lanka.
Manufacturers want to increase productivity by using available resources optimally, which is one of the reasons they are eager to adopt collaborative robots technology.
The primary goal of Universal Robots is to empower workers by enabling them with smart manufacturing solutions which involves the utilisation of collaborative robots technology and automation.
Sugath Jayatilake, Managing Director, Techfield, Sri Lanka, said, For a developing country like Sri Lanka, which is looking at a fast pace of development and at the same time would like to adopt cost effective, yet efficient technology, cobots would be the right way to go, especially for the small and medium-sized enterprises.
The strong distribution network, good reach to end customers, strong technical skills of Techfield and the unique product lines of Universal Robots, together envisions a large potential for cobots in the Sri Lankan market.
The company, which is a part of Teradyne Inc., is headquartered in Odense, Denmark, and has subsidiaries and regional offices in the USA, Spain, Germany, Italy, Czech Republic, China, Singapore, India, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea. (SS)

New CSE boss upbeat about future, looks at Rs. 2 bn market soon
The Colombo Bourse is on a strong revival path and foreign inflows too are picking up, said the new Chairman of Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) Ray Abeywardena.
Speaking to Daily News Business, he said that this positive trend is being recorded after nearly two years. Today, earning is very encouraging and we see this upward trend continuing.
Abeywardena, who is also the Managing Director of Acuity Partners Ltd., said that indices are turning positive after two years of negative returns.
He attributed the negative trend in the past two years to election propaganda which not only put local, but also foreign, investors on a wait-and-see footing. During the election campaigns, it was echoed that the Stock market was being manipulated and even that the Central Banks official figures were cooked. There was a lot of talk about pump and dump and these created negative sentiments.
He however said that Sri Lankas market turnover is still nowhere near to that of a country like Vietnam which was far below the Sri Lankan economy a few years ago.
While Sri Lankas annual turnover is around Rs. 910 million, Vietnams weekly turnovers are in excess of US$ 8 million and in Bangladesh it is US$ 100 million per year.
CSE is hoping to launch several new tools and products to attract new investors and I am looking at a Rs. 2 billion market in less than two years.
He also said that though there was a lot of talk of some of the government companies being listed it is still to materialise.
GOH Hotel, Hyatt, SriLankan Catering, Lanka Hospitals and Waters Edge were down to be listed, but are yet to take shape.
In addition, if some of the state banks even decide to list around 8% it would have a huge positive impact for the CSE.
Looking back, one can see that government companies that were listed remained very competitive. He foresaw Sri Lanka Telecom, Lanka Milk Foods, and Distilleries Corporation to be very competitive after they were listed.
Abeywardena also said that their plan to woo Maldivian and other foreign investors to invest in Sri Lanka is gaining momentum.
He said that they will aggressively pursue hosting investment forums overseas. We did have very good response from the previous CSE road shows in the USA, Australia and Dubai and this year too we will organise such events.

Nip this in the bud
There are ominous signs that defeated political elements are attempting to open up yet another flank to achieve their goal of a comeback, adding to the prevailing chaos of strikes, agitations and anti- government protests, to culminate in what they hope will be the ouster of the Yahapalanaya government. The explosive and incendiary issue of religion is now being merged to this heady cocktail to rouse the public. The recent attacks on a number of mosques is a pointer to the prevailing undercurrents, where these elements are hell bent on fomenting religious discord. A delegation of Muslim parliamentarians have already met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to apprise him of the deteriorating situation.
There is no issue at present such as the halal controversy that is said to have sparked the anti-Muslim riots in Aluthgama. With no tangible cause, whatsoever, in evidence, to provoke a retaliation by the majority community the conclusion is inescapable that a political hand is at work in the current spate of attacks on places of Muslim worship. What is contemplated is to drive a wedge between the two communities ala a Aluthgama and exploit the fallout for political gain.
It is therefore timely that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has chosen to read the riot act to these disruptive elements. Speaking at a ceremony at Temple Trees on Tuesday the Premier said the police had been directed to step up vigilance in the face of bankrupt politicians trying to instigate the people in a bid to recapture power. He also said that the vast majority of people had delivered a clear message against extremist forces bent on setting the country on fire as they had done under the previous regime. He said; Certain elements with vested interests that tried and failed to destabilize the country by propagating racism were trying to achieve the same objective by creating religious tensions.
The PM is aware of the dire necessity of confronting the situation head on before simmering tensions explode. He certainly would not want things to advance to the stage of a Aluthgama. The Cabinet too on Tuesday have taken serious note of the developments and decided on firm action to bring things under control. It has also decided to direct all police stations to be on alert in this connection.
There is no doubt that the politicians who have been thrown out of power are making desperate attempts for a comeback and will stop at nothing to attain their objectives. This can be observed from the heightened activism of the Trade Unions, the GMOA, teachers etc. who are obviously being manipulated by a political hand. We say this because most of their issues and demands had their origins during the previous regime. But the country did not witness protests and agitations to such a heightened degree. The SAITM issue is a clear example. Adding to the racist slogans that are being bandied about freely we now have the religious element, a deadly cocktail that is waiting to explode.
The government should act swiftly and firmly at the first sign of trouble and bring things under control before the situation deteriorates further and plunge the country into an ethno- religious volcano. It is not just the lunatic fringe, and certain bikkhus alone who are responsible. There are other elements too working openly and behind the scenes to create racist and religious tensions, among them certain private electronic media.
The modus operandi adopted is to get a rabid nationalist politician for interviews and bowl full tosses at him to elicit the responses that their political masters desire. The strategy is to show the government is not evenhanded in dealing with attacks carried out on places of Buddhist worship in the North when considering the alacrity in which it goes into action in the South. By this way it is hoped to inflame religious passions in the South, with the wrath directed at the government.
The recent attack on a police car in the North too has been reconstructed to show that the LTTE was still alive and kicking ignoring the attack on the police vehicle in Piliyandala while on a mission to detect narcotics, just to create the wrong picture in the minds of the public. Criminals abound in all parts of the country and the North is no exception. Taking a criminal act in the North out of context to portray it as something different to the people of the South is being ingeniously carried out with the government none the wiser.
Hence what is needed is an overall surveillance to detect ALL those responsible for spreading ethnic and religious hatred. If attacks on Buddhist shrines are carried out in the North, as claimed by some, this certainly should be investigated and the culprits brought to book. The law, needless to say, should cover the whole country. But, this in no way can justify retaliatory attacks in the South, instigated or otherwise.

The abolishment of the Executive Presidency, Empowerment of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution so as to strengthen commissions and other independent organisations and the establishment of an equitable electoral system were some of the main terms of the MoU.
The present regime has also contributed to the countrys progress by means of establishing independent commissions and strengthening the freedom for anyone to air their opinions.The Government also introduced the 19th Amendment to the Constitution with solutions for some of the prevailing problems as promised, Prof. Wijesooriya added.
The Convener also said that the Government still had not paid its fullest attention towards the abolishment of the Executive Presidency which was the main purpose for the establishment of a consensus Government in order to reform the Constitution.
Wijesooriya further said that the procedure to take legal action against criminals should be expedited to regain public confidence.
Fr. Reid Shelton Fernando, Keerthi Kariyawasam, Raja Uwatakeiyawa, Ariyawansa Dissanayake, Nadja Mohommed, Sirimasiri Hapuarachchi, Wickramabahu Karunaratne, Saman Rathanapriya and other members of the National Movement for Social Justice also participated.

Officials fail to solve teachers and principals issues
The Teachers' and Principals' Trade Union Collective yesterday charged that Education Ministry officials failed to provide solutions to the issues faced by teachers and principals.
Addressing the General Convention of the Teachers' and Principals' Trade Union Collective at the Viharamahadevi Open Air Theatre yesterday, All Island United Teachers' Union Chairman Ven. Yalwela Pagnnasekara Thera said political interference in promotions and transfers of teachers and principals has not changed.
They demanded the government to give due salary increments and promotions of the principals and to appoint qualified principals. They also demanded to bring amendments to the principals service minute to avoid issues related to promotions and the salaries of principals.
"Some officials of the Education Ministry act like uneducated people without finding solutions for the issues in the country's education sector. They are attempting to fulfill their wishes by supporting the political leadership," the Thera said.
All Ceylon Teachers' Union General Secretary Joseph Stalin and Common Professional Teachers' Association Chairman Gnanaratne Weerakoon also spoke.

Govt. to fill approximately 1,000 vacancies in North: Sagala Ratnayake
The Government will take immediate measures to fill approximately 1,000 vacancies in the North to address the unemployment issue in the area, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake informed Parliament yesterday.
The minister was replying to an Adjournment Motion moved by Opposition Leader R Sampanthan on the unemployment of youth in the North and East.
The minister told Parliament that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited Jaffna over the weekend and had lengthy discussions on the matter of unemployment of youth.
The Northern Chief Minister, several Jaffna district MPs and NPC ministers also attended the meeting. The protracted war had stopped employment creation in the area. The PM wanted me to communicate to the House that as the first measure to address this problem, approximately 1,000 vacancies in the North will be filled.
These will be as Development Officers and Teachers. Mostly Arts Graduates will be recruited and they will be given some training. Similar measures will be taken to address the unemployment issue in the East, he said.
The Opposition Leader demanded the immediate intervention of the Government to solve the unemployment issue in the North and East, also pointing out that almost eight years have lapsed since the end of war.
SLMC wants PSC appointed to look into archaeological destruction
Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Minister Rauff Hakeem yesterday in Parliament, requested for the appointment of a Parliament Select Committee (PSC) to look into allegations of destruction of archaeological sites and forests.
The minister made this request when Environment and Mahaweli Development Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam brought the attention of the House that the destruction of archaeological sites was a matter of concern in the North and East.
Deputy Minister Jayaratne told Parliament that a total of 94 archaeological sites in Ampara, Trincomalee and Batticaloa had been destroyed during the period from 2013 to 2017.
He said out of them, 47 sites were in Ampara, 30 in Trincomalee and 17 in Batticaloa.
He said it had been identified following a census that Ampara had 430 archaeological sites that needed to be protected. Commenting on the issues surrounding the Wilpattu forest, the Deputy Minister said the President has appointed an independent committee on May 17 to look into complaints by the people after declaring forest lands North of Wilpattu as a reserve. He said the report of this Committee was due within a month, adding that it would help to resolve the remaining problems in Wilpattu.
The issue came up as Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake pointed out that the Government should have made direct and immediate intervention when the issues of the Wilpattu forest clearing and destruction of archaeological sites in the East cropped up. Had the Government dealt with these issues immediately and more effectively, the intervention of other organizations or groups would have been unwarranted, he said.
Education Minister Kariyawasam pointed out the conduct of the Archaeological Department over the past years was highly questionable, adding that its inefficiency and apathy contributed to the sad state of affairs of the countrys archaeological heritage. Now we are restructuring this Department. Many vacancies in it had not been filled in the past, but we have now taken measures to fill them, he said.
Minister Hakeem intervening at this point, requested a PSC to look into the matters pertaining to archaeology and wildlife, adding that they have concerns over the Governments recent decisions with regard to those matters.
Some are using these very issues to trigger communal tensions. Let us have a broad discussion and solve them once and for all, he said. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said the proposal to appoint a PSC would be taken up at the next Party Leaders Meeting.
If former govt sorted out delimitation issue, no delay in holding LG elections: Minister Mustapha
The proper way of holding Local Government Elections without any unnecessary delay would not have been a problem if the previous government had sorted out the delimitation issue, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Mustapha in Parliament yesterday.The Minister further said that instead of solving the issue, the then Minister Hisbullah was dancing to the tune of the then Minister Basil Rajapaksa, creating delimitation in a Cool Room. He added that the previous government had created this mess, leaving us to sort out the mess they had created. That was one of the reason for the delay in holding the Local Government elections, Minister Mustapha said.
The Minister made these observations in response to a question raised by Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma.
The Minister also said that he always acted in a just manner. He added that the delimitation was a practical issue which had been made worse by Hisbullah during the previous regime. He added that had MP Dullas Alahapperuma been the minister responsible for preparing the delimitation during the previous government, it was sure that he (Minister Musthapa) would not have this problem today.
He also said that the government had cleared up the mess, while there were some political issues to be sorted out. He added that sorting out the technical problems had been completed.
He added that there were some political issues to be sorted out which were out of his purview.
The minority and minor parties need to discuss matters with the Prime Minister and other party leaders to sort out political issues, the Minister said.
Police should take responsibility in controlling such incidents: Minister Ratnayake
There had been several incidents that had caused communal disharmony in the recent past and there were flaws in implementing law and order against them from the Police, said Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake in Parliament yesterday.
He said the Police should take responsibility of controlling those incidents. He added that the Police should implement the law impartially, irrespective of religious and communal differences.
He made these observations in response to special statement made by EPDP Parliamentarian Douglas Devananda and Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake under Standing Order 23(2) on several incidents that could have affected communal harmony.
However, the Minister said the Police had informed him that investigations to the recent incidents of violence were in progress and they needed more time to provide him with complete findings of the recent incidents. The Police needed several days more, Minister Ratnayake said. Once investigations are over, the House would be informed.
Minister Ratnayake further said that there had been several incidents of law and order being taking place and the Police could have acted fast. At this stage, JVP Leader Dissanayake said that not only the Police, but the government too could have done so.
Yes, the government too, Minister Ratnayake said. We regret such incidents and we have paid them our fullest attention. We have emphasized to the Police that the law should be implemented and those responsible for the crimes should be dealt with. We would try to prevent the incidents of hate speech. We also accept that peace and maintenance of law and order is of paramount importance. Minister Ratnayake further said the bomb explosion at Manchester brought back memories of the dark era of our past to our minds. I as Minister of Law and Order, assure you that the government would to its best, the Minister said.
The minister also said that such isolated incidents have been accounted as acts against communal disharmony. One such incident was the Kahawatta incident. No body had attacked a shop owned by a Muslim person. One boutique had caught fire and the walls of the adjoining shop of the Muslim person had been gutted by the fire, the Minister said. The fire at the Muslim shop in Elpitiya was also another similar incident. CCTV footages proved a thief had robbed the shop and fled after setting fire to the shop. However, it was found that the suspect had been convicted for another theft in Kadugannawa two years ago.
Govt. slack in arresting culprits propagating racial harmony in country: JVP Leader
The Government has done nothing to arrest the culprits concerning several incidents that had taken place during the past several days that had caused racial and communal disharmony in the country, accused JVP Parliamentarian and Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation moving a special statement under Standing Order 23 (2).
MP Dissanayake said the majority of Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim communities abhor such violence. He added that none of them wanted to see the country being pushed towards communal disharmony. He also added that only a small group of people in our communities attempt to resume violent activities. They seem to have various intentions and motivations, including the creating of a Sinhala and Muslim clash. It is the duty of the government to act fast and prevent the country from being pushed towards disharmony by such groups.
The government should have acted fast in preventing a situation that could push the country towards another bloodbath, MP Dissanayake said. There are serious doubts in the minds of the public that the government in the face of social and economic problems, was trying to make use of these violent incidents to divert the minds of the public.
EPDP leader Douglas Devananda too making a special statement on the incidents of communal disharmony, reported in the recent past and urged the government to take immediate action to prevent the furtherance of similar incidents.
Act to suppress media: A wrong and incorrect statement: Dy. Minister Paranavithana
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavithana refuted the statement that there was an attempt to move an Act to suppress Mass Media.
The Deputy Minister expressed his views in Parliament yesterday in response to a statement made by Joint Opposition Member Sisira Jayakody, who said that there was a rumour that the government was getting ready to pass an act to suppress the media.
It is a wrong and incorrect statement, said Deputy Minister Paranavithana. There was a proposal pointing out the need of setting up an Independent Commission to regulate the media. It also was a proposal made by the media themselves.
Deputy Minister Paranavithana said that acting on the proposal, a media advertisement was published to get the views of the public to set up an independent media mechanism.
Angunakolapelessa Prison to be opened next month: Justice Minister
The Angunakolapelessa new prison will be opened next month, Justice Minister Dr Wijayedasa Rajapakshe said in Parliament yesterday.
The construction of the prison complex commenced in 2014. The opening of this prison complex built with modern facilities by spending a large sum of money was postponed at a previous occasion as the President declined the official invitation to attend the ceremony.
The minister also said plans were afoot to shift the Welikada Prison to Horana. He said these moves would help to ease the overcrowding in prisons. He pointed out that about 17,000 persons are in prisons at present, adding that about 50 percent of them are youth imprisoned for drug related offences.
Rajapakshe was moving Civil Procedure Code (Amendment) Bill for debate yesterday.
The minister said amendments were aimed at addressing the delay in civil court cases. He pointed out a total of 745,888 cases had been piled up in the countrys courts of law, adding that the majority of them were at Magistrate and District Courts. As at December 31, 2016, there were 3,566 cases in the Supreme Court, 4,837 cases in the Appeal Court, 171,896 cases in District Courts and 539,392 cases in Magistrate Courts, the minister said. He also said the Government is working to introduce a new Civil Procedure Code and Criminal Procedure Code to suit modern times. He added that two Committees comprised of legal experts are working for that purpose.

Police, AGs Dept. disinterested, Laliths murder unsolved: Dayanthe Athulathmudali
Following are excerpts of the speech:
When Prof. Fernando requested me to speak today, I declined saying that my utterances may be interpreted as being supportive of the contents of the book being launched this evening. As he repeatedly requested and then gave me the freedom to say anything of relevance I wished, I thought I will start by doing some checks on who Prof Ravindra Fernando is.
I asked my Doctor friends who now have the word `Emeritus, like Prof. Fernando has, in front of their chosen speciality in SLs Medical fraternity. The first I asked was a classmate from my first day in Royal at the age of five. He said such glowing things about Prof. Fernando and so much about his dedication to Forensics. Being a professional, far removed from Forensics, I thought that I should show support to another professional so dedicated to his chosen field. My brief encounters with Forensic specialist have been only when Civil Aircraft crash and the pilots have died in the crash. So, I am the least competent to introduce a Prof. of Forensics or the contents of his book. However, I can claim that I am the most concerned person wanting to know whether the contents of the book lead to how the deceased came to be gunned down 24 yrs. ago, as he was my only brother.
When I realized that the Chief Guest was the Attorney General, I changed my stance as there is so much to say to an AG and the IGP over the unsolved murder of Lalith.
I will start with the attitudes of two countries towards unsolved murders. The first is a country that Laliths name is still held in high esteem and I was fortunate to spend 10 years. there. Yes, it was the PM of Singapore that offered Lalith citizenship when he was about to leave the National University of Singapore (NUS), after having given his best to develop the legal fraternity there. Late PM, Lee Kwan Yew, went beyond citizenship, and wanted him to be a member of his Cabinet.
I first met a Singaporean Supreme Court judge called Justice P. H. Rubin, soon after taking residence there four years after Laliths demise. It was strange to discover that Rubin, a Muslim, having a typical Jewish name, had started life in Galle. Having migrated to Singapore many decades ago, he took to Law studies and became one of Laliths students in the NUS.
Although not associated with Law, I was always warmly received by Laliths senior students such as Prof. Tommy Koh and on many occasions by Justice Rubin. On one such pleasant interaction, I broached him on what Singapores attitude was to Unsolved Murders. In response, he recalled the few Sinhala words he could remember from Galle, and uttered that it was considered a  Kelellak. He explained that an unsolved murder, after a reasonable period of time, was a slur on all the Govt. Departments that were engaged in it. Supervisory means were in place so that laws were applied to see that every case led to a conclusion and that every possible expertise was sought even from abroad, including DNA tests that were yet to be introduced in many countries. It is noteworthy that SIN allows a `reasonable period of time before the `kelelle word is self-stamped. Will 24 years then be reasonable for SL to self- tarnish itself in its wobbly, time consuming passage to see a legal conclusion for a murder Having mentioned time consummation, I wish to share thoughts on the often repeated phrase Laws Delays.
I ask you, have you heard of phrases such as Engineers Delay or Surgeons Delay The latter leading to sure death making room for the Forensics like our amiable Prof to move in quickly. Another irksome phrase when court cases do get started is that of being given a Date. This assuredly adds to delay and the accused called upon to pay Counsel for the new Date as well. In the event of a murder case, being given a date means prolonging the pain of the next of kin in waiting for justice to be done while continuing to bear the pain of severance from the victim. When many dates are given and that has stretched for years with no more dates forth coming, the pain is compounded with eternal waiting for a conclusion befitting the deceased. Is it not what has happened in Laliths murder So, you know why I am pained Every publication such as what is launched today, gives me hope that we may be getting closer to who was behind what happened 24 years ago. So why is there no progress from the Govt. Departments/Institutes that are responsible for conclusive action once a serious crime has been committed
I have on many an occasion wondered whether the word `Assassination is what has brought upon `Delays in restarting enquiries on Laliths killing. Would a plain title such as The Murder of Lalith resulted in kick-starting a proper legally tenable enquiry How come that the cases of `Thajudeen and Lasantha have received justice by renewed examinations Is it that the appointment of a Presidential Commission of enquiry has led to total in-action on any follow up soon after the Commission ended Or, has there been a deliberate `Laissez-Faire attitude set- in those to do nothing about a murder, simply because it has been termed an assassination
Assuming that the two Govt. Departments responsible for re-examination or re-starting an inconclusive murder case are the Police and AGs Departments, are they then waiting for a politician to nudge them from their slumber That too, to do what they should have done as a part of their duties in solving serious crimes.
In less than a year, it will be 25 years since Lalith was gunned down. In the event the status quo remains the same, with no legally tenable end to the unsolved murder, I recommend that a new book be launched on April 23, 2018.
I would like to see such a book been written by the legal fraternity, Hope-fully by someone who has reached great heights in the law after having attended some of Laliths lectures on his favourite subject, `Jurisprudence. I would like to suggest the title for the book to be: Legal Luminary Lalith, Let-down in his Last Lap, by Law that he taught Lawyers. To my son and daughter, I will sadly say that they will never know who planned their Mahappas murder.
In the event that Lalith had accepted LKYs invitation and become a Singaporean citizen, he would still be alive. But, SL would not have a `Mahapola. Would the unthinkable, of Lalith being gunned down in Singapore have happened, what would have taken place after a reasonable period of time It is my belief that Singapore gallows would have worked one more time than its reputed once a week. That too, after the culprit(s) had completed all legal formalities that an accused is required to follow.
Those grateful students who learnt Jurisprudence from him would have pursued criminal justice being implemented and not merely texts in Singaporean law.
After 25 years, if left grieving, it would not merely be a brother, a daughter, a nephew and niece. Many in the hall, also lost an elder brother or their Mentor. Though hopelessly lost by then, all of them will continue searching for the truth.
In my world of Electronic Engineering, all sessions of interaction end with the flick of a switch. However, keeping in mind that I have ventured this afternoon to where endless flow of words, over 24 years appears to be the norm, I will for once borrow a phrase from lawyers, and say that I rest my Case. Heres hoping that Lalith though reduced to ashes, does rest in peace, while his pathetic case is waiting to move forward.
Thank you for permitting me to be verbose for justice to re-start the case.

President visits National Arboretum in Canberra
President Maithripala Sirisena visited the National Arboretum in Canberra yesterday morning.
He was received by the Attorney General of Canberra Gordon Ramsay who represented the Chief Minister of Canberra. Scott Saddler, Acting Executive Manager of the Arboretum was also present.
The President planted a Mahogany sapling in the Arboretum to mark his visit to Australia.
Ramsay said the visit of President Sirisena, who is also the Minister of Environment, to National Arboretum is indeed an honour.
Saddler elaborated that the arboretum was set up after bush fires in 2003 which devastated nearly 20,000 acres. About 44,000 seeds have been planted in the arboretum which also serves as the unique centre of environment learning for students.
The National Arboretum Canberra features 94 forests of rare, endangered and symbolic trees from around Australia and the world. Many trees are still young but two of the forests are nearly 100 hundred years old.
Over 44,000 trees from over 100 countries are growing across the 250 hectare site, making it one of the worlds largest living collections of rare, endangered and significant trees.
President Sirisena signed the visitors book as the Minister of Environment, highlighting his vision for a green world.

Pull no punches!
His technique proficiency is amazing at the game. This and a lot of hard work and dedication helped him move up the ladder to reach the number two spot in Asia and the 15th place in the world. He is also Sri Lankas Cadet Karate team captain for 2016 and a Peterite Karateka.
Randev Athukorala has started karate when he was six years old. His father, Dr Rohantha Athukorala, influenced him to take up the sport since he too has done karate from a tender age.
I too wanted to engage in a sport to keep fit. So karate seemed a good option. Little did I know that I would excel and make it to the international level in the sport, Randev said with a smile.
He notes that quite a few students took up karate along with him. The numbers have increased with the years along with the popularity of the sport. Today, karate is the second most popular sport in Sri Lanka.
Randev says that the general perception towards karate is as a blood sport but it actually requires a lot of technique, proficiency and is a real art work. It can be practiced as a self defense or a combat sport. It emphasizes on self development.
Karate means empty fist. Therefore it basically involves hand combination kind of techniques. Judo is more about throws while taekwondo involves kicks. However karate is a mixture of all these though the emphasis is on the hands, he explained.
Randev had taken part in his first tournament when he was seven years old. It was a district event. Then he went on to win the provincial tournament and later he got into the national tournaments.
I did not win the nationals in my first tournament but after many more practices I managed to emerge winner at the event at the end of 2008, he said.
He has won gold medals at tournaments like the Nepal International Karate Tournament which was held in Dhangadhi, Nepal, and the South Asian Karate Tournament which was held in New Delhi, India. He had bagged silver medals at the Silent Knight International Karate Cup, Malaysia, Iran International Karate Tournament held in Teheran, Iran, and the Asian Milo Karate Championship held in Malaysia. He won his black belt which reflects the highest degree of competence in the sport last year. He was awarded the Outstanding Sportsman and Coloursman by St Peters College.
Queried on what makes a good karate player Randev was quick to note that it is mainly determination that is the key to excelling in the sport.
You need focus and good self discipline as well, he added.
The battle maybe with only one opponent at a time but Randev notes that this makes the task more difficult.
You get points for the attacks that you do. There are roughly about seven attacks but there are beyond 30 to 40 techniques that you can use to eliminate your foe.
He notes that meditation is important for warming up and cooling down. It helps players focus and be attentive in situations.
Since I am preparing for my G C E Ordinary Levels the number of days that I engage in my training sessions has reduced. I used to practice every day in the past. Now my schedule includes practicing twice with the national team and three times with my personal trainer. I also train one day with my father. My training sessions normally last for around four to two hours, Randev said adding that the last international tournament he took part in was the South Asian Championship in October, 2016. He will be taking part in the South Asian Karate Tournament which will be held in Sri Lanka in August.
The talented karateka has trained under Shihan Hiroshi Ota (8th Dan Black belt), Shihan Allan Campbell (6th Dan Black belt) and Shihan K Gopalan (10th Dan Black Belt). Randevs formative training was under Sensei D M D Nimal and Sensei Safraz. National coaches Sensei Jurangpathy and Sensei Kalyani is training him for the upcoming South Asian Games 2017 and Olympics 2020. His father is his manager. The Rector of St Peters College Rev Fr Trevor Martin, Sports Coordinator Rev Fr Thilina Pathum and his family priest Rev Fr Lakmin give him spiritual guidance.
Recalling his moments of glory during his tours Randev notes that he felt accomplished after taking part in the South Asian Karate Championship which was held in October 2016. The event was held in India and Randev was the captain of the seven member cadet team.
However my most memorable tour was the Indonesian tournament because it was unlike all the previous tournaments that I have taken part in. The standards of the events were on
par with the internationally acclaimed tournaments. There were opening and closing ceremonies. There was a dinner after the tournaments for the players. Many of the top ranking players were present at the event, he said adding that karate is going to be a part of the Olympics in 2020.
Randev says that it has been tough in the beginning to balance his studies and sport but he gradually developed his own discipline and adapt to a schedule.
Every day is challenging and I ask myself whether I would be able to run things smoothly. You need to be update about everything in the game because the rules keep evolving as the sport had gained more popularity during recent years. I succeeded mainly because of my family and teachers support, he expressed.
Randevs father, Dr Rohantha Athukorala, is a marketer at World Bank. His mother, Roshani, is a teacher at St. Peters College. His brother, Rehan, is in grade two and is also engaged in karate.
Randev says that as one grows more serious with the sport and takes on more tournaments, ones diet needs to be changed as well to suit the requirements. Randev had to take in more protein as he excelled in karate.
He admires the karate number one ranker Rafael Aghayev of Azerbaijan. He notes that he looks up to him because Aghayev took karate to a different level.
He changed his fighting techniques while following the rules of the game. His fighting techniques are not those you would expect from a normal person. He changed the mindset of other
players by taking the sport to different standards, he enthused.
Randev likes to listen to soul and pop music during his free time. He also enjoys reading books. His loves spending time with his family and loved ones. The familys recent passion is going on safaris. They have been to Yala and Wennapuwa for their holidays.
Randev wants to follow his G C E Advanced Levels in the Commerce stream and become a marketer like his father.
Life is too short to restrict yourself. Be outgoing. Do not hesitate to push yourself. Put studies first but try to strike a balance between them and your other activities. A person who does not waste his time but put it to good use will become successful in life, he opined.

Ravi Mangala Yoga in Cabinet
The much anticipated Cabinet reshuffle eventually took place on Monday and saw several key portfolios change hands. The objective of the reshuffle was to apparently stifle growing dissent within the National Unity government - although critics have quick to point out that it only amounted to a round of musical chairs with ministers swapping subjects among each other.
The reshuffle- almost two years into the tenure of this government- was a long time in the making. Initial speculation was that a reshuffle would take place with the dawn of the New Year. As the rumours dragged on, it was then expected before the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
Thereafter, at a meeting with newspaper editors and publishers, President Maithripala Sirisena indicated that it would be undertaken before Vesak. Eventually, it did take place in the month of Vesak, but after the Vesak Poya holidays, a few hours before the President left on a visit to Australia.
The most significant change brought about by the reshuffle is the swapping of the Finance and Foreign Affairs portfolios between ministers Ravi Karunanayake and Mangala Samaraweera. Karunanayakes removal had been a demand of a section of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and its coalition partner, the United National Party (UNP), had been steadfastly resisting this.
Key institutions
The UNP has finally yielded, but by no means has Karunanayake been sacrificed: he has been offered the other plum portfolio in the Cabinet, Foreign Affairs. In addition, several other institutions which were under Karunanayake as Finance Minister, will remain under his purview. They include the National Lotteries Board, the Development Board, the Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund and the troubled national carrier, SriLankan Airlines.
The retention of these subjects under the minister of Foreign Affairs appears surprising on paper- and is unprecedented- but it is clear it was the result of some hard-nosed bargaining between the UNP and the SLFP factions of the government. In the end, the SLFP had its way by having Karunanayake removed from the Finance portfolio, but it came at a price, where several key institutions remained with him.
Nevertheless, it was well known that Karunanayake, an accountant by profession, would have preferred the Finance portfolio. Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had telephoned to commiserate with him. Karunanayake, to his credit, has however accepted the new portfolio without dissent and if he was disappointed with the change, did not show it when he was taking his oaths.
Stepping into Karunanayakes shoes is Mangala Samaraweera. Samaraweera is a former SLFPer who defected to the UNP during the Rajapaksa era and is an avowed loyalist of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga as well. He is now firmly with the UNP. Apart from being appointed Minister of Finance he has also been entrusted with the portfolio of Mass Media, a subject previously held by Gayantha Karunathilake, who has been assigned the Ministry of Lands and Parliamentary Reform instead.
While Minister Samaraweeras appointment as Finance Minister was much anticipated, many did not expect him to be bestowed with the Mass Media portfolio as well. This subject is not alien to him though, having served as Minister of Mass Media under President Chandrika Kumaratunga. He was assertive but also controversial in this role.
The other major change that was effected in the reshuffle was appointing the vociferous Arjuna Ranatunga as Minister of Petroleum Resource Development, taking away the Ministry of Ports and Shipping from him. This portfolio has been assigned to Mahinda Samarasinghe, who was formerly the Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training.
It is no secret that Ranatunga was an outspoken critic of the proposed Hambantota Port agreement with the Chinese government and that his interventions had led to many modifications of the agreement. His transfer is seen by many as a consequence of his actions but he has now been entrusted with another vital portfolio- Petroleum Resource Development- where international interactions are still a key issue.
UNP governments
Ranatungas transfer was also interesting because there was general consensus that, despite any changes in portfolios, subjects assigned to the UNP will remain within the UNP and likewise for the SLFP. Now, Ports and Shipping has been taken away from a UNP minister and assigned to a SLFP minister.
However, this becomes a moot point because Ranatunga was a longstanding SLFPer with strong family ties to the party who contested from the UNP at the last election only because the circumstances demanded it. Similarly, Mahinda Samarasinghe began his political career in the UNP and crossed over to the SLFP later!
The only real change in the reshuffle, so to speak, was the inclusion of senior lawyer and former Attorney General Tilak Marapana in the Cabinet once again. Marapana has been long and faithful servant of the UNP and has been particularly loyal to party leader Wickremesinghe. He has held the portfolios of Defence, Transport, Aviation and Highways in previous UNP governments.
In this government, he was assigned the portfolio of Law and Order and Prison Reforms and held that portfolio for a few months before he fell on his sword and resigned over the Avant Garde controversy, after he defended the issue in Parliament. It was felt at the time that his continuation as a minister could be construed as impeding investigations into Avant Garde.
Marapana has now been appointed as Minister of Development Assignments. His return to the Cabinet is an indication of the imprimatur of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on this reshuffle. Ever the astute politician, the Prime Minister has used this opportunity to invite a trusted ally back into the Cabinet.
If the changes among UNP ministers were noteworthy, the changes made to most SLFP portfolios appear to be cosmetic in nature. W.D.J. Seneviratne, who was recently engaged in a public spat with Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and who was the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations has been assigned the additional subject of Sabaragamuwa Development. Similarly, S.B. Dissanayake, now a vociferous ally of President Sirisena, who was Minister of Social Empowerment and Welfare, has been assigned the additional subject of Kandyan Heritage.
The only change of note within the ranks of the SLFP is Chandima Weerakkody, a former Deputy Speaker, being relieved of his portfolio of Petroleum Resources and being entrusted with the subject of Skills Development and Vocational Training instead.
The General Secretary of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, Mahinda Amaraweera could be excused if he is a disappointed man after the reshuffle. A few months ago, it was President Sirisena himself who hinted that Amaraweera would be granted a portfolio where he could serve the entire country better and those remarks added to the speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle.
Cabinet reshuffle
Amaraweera, who was Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources has now been also appointed as State Minister of Mahaveli Development, a portfolio held by the President himself. Presidential duties are obviously taking its toll on the President Sirisenas time and he has entrusted this portfolio- a subject very close to his heart-to Amaraweera, albeit as State Minister.
That the government was not prepared to ruffle too many feathers with the Cabinet reshuffle is clear. There have been other ministries which have come under relentless public scrutiny in recent months but their ministers have not been changed.
For instance, the crisis over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) has engulfed the health and higher education sectors for many months now. In the health sector, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is more on strike than not while medical students in state medical faculties are boycotting lectures. The ministers concerned, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Lakshman Kiriella have come in for a lot of flak over this- but their portfolios remain unchanged.
This reshuffle would have been an ideal opportunity to assign different subjects to Senaratne and Kiriella but the President and the Prime Minister chose not to do so. It is therefore an indication that the government intends to pursue the solution it has envisaged for the SAITM- and other proposed private medical colleges- in earnest.
To expect the Cabinet reshuffle to be a panacea for all the ills of the government is to be nave as well as overly optimistic. Still, the reshuffle is likely to silence the rumblings of dissent within the government of National Unity- at least for now.

## Title: For the sake of State

For the sake of State
The state has a long history of involvement in the economy in Sri Lanka; state ownership of utilities dates back to the colonial era. Post independence experiments with socialism saw the expansion of the state into many new areas of business. Despite some reforms in the 1977-2005 era state enterprises still account for a significant share of the economy. The 2005-2015 period saw a halt to the privatisation process and a renewed wave of expansion in state businesses.
Between 2009 and 2015 the number of State Owned Enterprises (SOE)s grew from 107 to 245 while the number employed grew from 140,500 to a staggering 237,811.
State involvement in the economy seems to be taken for granted, but should it be so
The Department of Public Enterprises is supposed to monitor governance in Public Enterprises (Commercial Corporations, Government Owned Companies and Statutory Boards), but by its own admission only 55 of SOE's come under its purview. The last available performance report (2015) indicates that the 55 SOE's considered strategically important obtained budgetary support of Rs.95bn with a further Rs.19bn being granted for restructuring, a vast sum but an improvement from the Rs126bn granted the year before.
Economic efficiency
Bank borrowings by these SOE's stood at Rs.658bn as at end 2015, up from Rs.471.2bn as at end 2014. The size of the SOE's and the breadth of their activity make it an important determinant of the overall productivity of the economy. Consequently, the governance of SOEs is critical to ensure their positive contribution to a countrys overall economic efficiency and competitiveness.
This extremely difficult due to certain inherent problems in the structure of ownership.
1) Governments are run by politicians, not businessmen. Politicians can only make political decisions, not economic ones and these decisions will tend to be focused on short term publicity and benefits, ignoring long term consequences. An example is the launch of a company called Polipto Lanka to convert rubber and polythene waste to diesel. It was launched in 2009 amidst much fanfare but despite regular grants from the treasury has yet to show any commercial results or even demonstrate that the process is economically feasible. Coincidentally, the launch took place a week before a general election. Polipto receives regular budget support from the Treasury, support for the last three years amounted to Rs.120m.
2) Governments use other people's money, businesses must risk their own money. If a business does not earn a profit, the owner will need to keep infusing funds and this provides a powerful incentive to improve efficiency. The general public, whose money is effectively at risk in a state venture do not have the wherewithal or knowledge to hold managers or politicians to account. Politicians would prefer to postpone hard decisions than risk personal unpopularity, which is why state enterprises can keep running losses year after year. The JEDB and SLSPC have not reported a profit in the last five years, Mihin Lanka never made a profit since its inception, yet they continue to operate, the losses being paid by taxpayers because politicians will not risk bad publicity that may follow any attempts to reform them.
The Director General of Public Enterprises admitted as much in his report of 2009:
We have found some boards take affairs of the enterprise very lightly regardless of their strategic importance even in a situation where PE [Public Enterprise] faces very difficult time. Since there is no formal procedure to hold the chairman and the board of directors accountable, for their weak performance or unacceptable practices, some boards act with sheer indifference in discharging their responsibility.
3) State enterprises tend to be monopolies or restrict competition from the private sector. A business that faces no competition will find it easier to report profits. Where state businesses face competition the Government may grant SOE's preferential tax or other benefits that hinder the ability of the private sector to compete, causing a deterioration in service or increasing costs to consumers. A few years ago VAT was imposed on large supermarkets but LakSathosa was exempted from this. The previously unprofitable LakSathosa started to make profits, while the efficient local supermarkets which were penalised.
SOE's which operate as monopolies may not deliver an adequate level of service or charge excessive prices, which may lower the productivity/efficiency of the wider economy. When telecoms were in state hands obtaining a telephone connection, essential for business, was a luxury that required a wait of several years. Thanks to liberalisation phone connections are available over the counter but businesses still struggle to obtain power connection and may have to invest in standby generators due to unreliability. Energy costs (fuel and electricity) do not reflect the decline in global oil prices partly due to inefficiencies within the CPC/CEB, impacting on the competitiveness of business.
Inefficiencies in the state managed port terminals are a drag on trade but fortunately throughput at the privately managed SAGT Queen Elizabeth Quay is far greater and a boon to business. The SAGT terminal has been ranked number one for terminal productivity in South Asia by the Journal of Commerce in the USA, and ranked it number 4 in the world. Because of the faster turnaround time the ships prefer to dock the Port the Queen Elisabeth Quay.
SOE's, especially those that lose money are partly funded by banks. When a large chunk of bank lending is directed towards SOE's, the private sector will find funds harder to obtain and the interest rates higher, a phenomenon referred to as crowding out.
4) Governments cannot boost overall employment by hiring workers for the state sector. Giving people state-sector jobs may appear to create employment but this causes a problem because each new position brings with it a tax obligation that imposes a burden on the private sector, where wealth is generated and taxes paid. Effectively, since the salary of a public-sector employee reduces the amount of funds available to private employers, a job created in the public sector causes an offsetting loss in the private sector.
5) State-owned enterprises may enjoy hidden subsidies in a variety of forms including preferential borrowing costs, lower rents or taxes. Thus the actual costs will be higher than reported in the accounts and very difficult to quantify without detailed analysis.
For example, imagine if ministries or SOE's had to pay market rents for the space in Government buildings that they utilise. Few would occupy the highly-valued areas they do now and would probably occupy less office space.
State-owned property
Indeed, there is a massive opportunity cost of state-owned property in that they do not generate a net tax income for the state. If these properties were utilised by the private sector they would generate taxes as well as rents. Second, government office buildings in city centres create additional congestion. Given the current state of information technology, most government offices could and should be moved far from city centres.
It is important to note that these are structural problems inherent to all SOEs and are independent of the party in power. Losses in SOEs are a problem but their inefficiencies can have an even more serious impact on the wider economy.
More worrying to the public is the fact that the full extent of the problem is unknown. The Treasury and other bodies supposed to monitor SOEs do so only partially, and, by all accounts ineffectually. How much of public resources are being drained away in this financial black hole
Tax payers and citizens surely deserve better

The duo formed a devastating pair of explosive opening batsmen. They turned the game on its head giving a new concept to what opening batsmen should do. Since the inception of the World Cup in England in 1975, the cricketing world had not seen this new concept that JAYASURIYA and KALUWITHARNE put on display by going over the top in the first 15 overs when there was field restrictions and accumulating big runs.
Both were powerfully built opening batsmen. They feasted on the opposing bowlers like hyenas and when ball hit bat, it rocketed over the fielders. Runs and boundaries flowed as they put on totals of over 80 to 90 runs in the first 15 overs and paved the way for batsmen who followed to take the team to imposing totals that dispirited, frustrated and lured the opponents to destruction.
The opposing teams were in a daze not knowing what was hitting them. It was the traditional thing to go slow in the first 15 overs, losing few wickets and keeping in reserve batsmen who could put bowlers to the sword in the final 15 overs although there were no fielding restrictions.
Fell by the way side
Many opening batsmen tried to copy the style of JAYASURIYA and KALUWITHARNE, but sadly fell by the way side, not knowing the know how. In the limited over tournaments that followed opposing teams tried this ploy, but with little success as they did not have destroyers like JAYASURIYA and KALUWITHRANE. To them goes the credit of introducing a new concept to the game.
JAYASURIYA was tagged the MATARA MAULER, the MASTER BLASTER and the writer who closely followed the unwinding of his phenomenal career from the time he scored two unbeaten double hundred on a tour of Pakistan with the Sri Lanka A team tagged him the BLACK SUPERMAN. KALUWITHARNE was tagged LITTLE KALU by that South African born England captain and Commentator Tony Greig who was excited and elated by this small made big hitting wonder.
First to JAYASURIYA. From the time he was knee high to a bat, his one ambition was to hit the covers off the ball. Coming from a little known school down South, St.Servatius College, he did not have the elite or the best of coaches to show and tell him how and correct any flaw or technique in his play. But he had the DNA in him-- as tight as any vein or nerve would. And as his career bloomed and blossomed his natural technique and ability began to unwind thanks to the principal G.l.Galapathy and coach Lionel Wagasinghe.
He served notice of his immense potential making two unbeaten double hundreds with the Sri Lanka A team in Pakistan and that was the stepping stone and the rock on which he built his fantastic career. A left hander gifted with a quick eye and excellent footwork, there was no thing called getting ones eye in before launching. If the first ball was meant to be hit, he would take the plunge and hit with the result being a scorching four or a huge six. That was JAYASURIYA for you.
He played first division cricket for Bloomfield and Colombo Cricket Club and made telling scores and it was not long when he caught the eyes of the selectors who were quick to reward him with the national cap  the dream of any sportsman. And he adorned that cap with great respect and aplomb to the very end of a phenomenal and glittering career and his rocket like propelled hitting is still being spoken of in awe.
Shots were rocket propelled
JAYASURIYAS eye catching shots were the cut and the pull. When he hit it was rocket propelled and the fielders and the bowlers were helpless and could only watch the flight of the ball as it sailed over between point and cover like a missile for maximum  six. He was one of the main players in the 1995/96 World Cup triumph and was rightly adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the Tournament and won for him a sleek AUDI limousine.
He became the Sri Lankan batsman to make a massive triple hundred against India and when it looked as though he would break Brian Laras record of 374, he lunged forward and failed to keep the ball down and the ensuing lolly was grabbed by Sourav Ganguly at silly mid off off Chauhan. The packed R.Premadasa Stadium saw a deathly silence when he was dismissed.
JAYASURIY held the record for the fastest 50 in 17 balls against Pakistan, fastest 100 against Pakistan in 48 balls and fastest 150 against England in 95 balls. He made a scintillating 213 against England at the Oval which helped Sri Lanka win that memorable Test match. In Sharjah he made a belligerent 189 against India and going for a hit what would have earned him a six and past Pakistans Saeed Anwers top score of 194 he was stumped off a wide ball from Ganguly. To him 4s and 6s hitting was chicken feed.
JAYASURIYA was an all rounder in the manner born. In addition to his belligerent left hand batting, he was a feared left arm spinner and as a fielder he was a Colin Bland and a Jonty Rhodes in any position. He was also an example of a sportsman. Once he took a bump catch and before the umpire could raise his dreaded second finger, he signaled to the umpire that he caught it on the bump. He also captained the Country with distinction and when everyone was losing theirs and blaming it on him he doffed his captaincy.
To mention his achievements and records will need reams and reams. Historians and statisticians have done that for posterity but suffice to say, he played  TESTS 110 RUNS 6973  HIGHEST 340  HUNDREDS 14  FIFTIES 31- FOURS 910  SIXES 59 --- ODIS 445  RUNS 13,430 HIGHEST 189  HUNDREDS 28  FIFTIES 68  FOURS -1500  SIXES 270 ---- T20s 31  RUNS 629  HIGHEST 88 FOURS 76  SIXES 23.

Saudis, UAE will donate US$ 100 mn to WB fund for women entrepreneurs
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates will donate a combined $100 million to a World Bank fund for women entrepreneurs that was the brainchild of Ivanka Trump.
The announcement by World Bank President Jim Young Kim came during a visit to Saudi Arabia by President Trump, who was accompanied by his wife, Melania, daughter Ivanka and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. "We thought it was a fantastic idea," Kim said.
"But we had no idea how quickly this would build. This is really a stunning achievement.
I've never seen anything come together so quickly, and I really have to say that Ivanka's leadership has been tremendous."
The money will help kick off a $1 billion women's empowerment fund that the World Bank will announce in July, he said.
The UAE's U.S. ambassador, Yousef Al Otaiba, said in a statement that the promised donation reflects "our commitment to empowering women in our region and builds on the progress we have made in our country, where women play a role in every segment of society." (The Independent)

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he has instructed the authorities responsible for the countrys security to strictly impose the law against those who try to disrupt peace in the country, irrespective of their status.
The President said at a time when a broad dialogue has been initiated for peace and reconciliation in the country, a small group of politically affiliated people with vested interests were trying to instigate problems to put the government into difficulty.
The President was speaking to a group of Sri Lankans domiciled in Australia at the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canberra.
The President went on to say that to propagate peace and unity in the country the government had brought the 19th Amendment.
He said that even separate ministries have been established to realise the above.
While noting that the recent spate of strikes launched by a group of doctors in Sri Lanka will affect the opportunities of children at higher education, the President said needy parents even go to the extent of selling their belongings and property to meet their childrens expenses at private educational institutions.
President Sirisena also noted that a large number of government doctors have now sought greener pastures in foreign countries.

UAE Ambassador Al Mulla for increasing biz with SL
The United Arab Emirates (UAE) total investments in Sri Lanka have sharply decreased from US$ 213 million in 2012 to US$ 12.904 million in 2016.
The UAEs total investments in Sri Lanka stood at US$ 111 million, US$ 31 million and US$ 17 million in 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively, according to official statistics.
UAE Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Abdul Hamid Al Mulla, speaking at the Meet the Ambassador programme on Bilateral Trade between Sri Lanka and the UAE organised by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, said that since the end of war, Sri Lankas economy was going through a strong phase.
He further said that both countries need to work together to consolidate bilateral cooperation and help in bringing new business engagements.
In addition, the UAE has opened a visa centre in Colombo to enable the speedy issue of visit visas for Lankan businessmen who wish to travel to the UAE on business visa.
The total trade between the UAE and Sri Lanka accounted for US$ 1.3 billion in 2016.
However, the total trade which stood at US$ 1,822 million in 2013 has decreased to US$ 1,342 million in 2016.
The balance of trade has been in the favour of the UAE and trade balance between Sri Lanka and the UAE which stood at US$ 1,327 million in 2014 has decreased to US$ 793 million in 2016.
Tea, apparel, natural rubber, desiccated coconut, copra, cashew nuts, essential oil, fruits and vegetables, processed food, sea food, and rubber products are the major Sri Lankan exports commodities to the UAE, while petroleum oils, gold, precious stones, plastics, sugar, aluminum, electronic equipment, and machinery are the major imports to Sri Lanka.
The Ambassador further said the UAE is looking to sign two agreements on Protection and Promotion of Investment and Cooperation and Technical Assistance in Customs Affairs.
He said the UAE is also planning to sign two Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs): one on establishing a Joint Committee for Consumer Affairs and another on Social, Cultural and Educational Matters. Negotiations are currently underway between Sri Lanka and the UAE to this end.
Under UAE 2021 Vision, we want to make the UAE among the best countries in the world by 2021 while further consolidating our international ties and political stability in a bid to attract foreign direct investments into the UAE, the Ambassador said.
The UAE is the largest export market for Sri Lankan products and the largest source of imports to Sri Lanka in the Gulf region.

Contempt of Court case :
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was not present in Court yesterday regarding a Contempt of Court action filed against him over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court amounts to Contempt of Court on January 25, last year.
The Court of Appeal Justices Rohini Walgama and Judge S.Thurairaja observed that the Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on the next date.
However, counsel Anusha Perusinghe appearing on behalf of Gnanasara Thera informed Court that her client was not present in Court since he was ill. She undertook to produce the accused along with a medical certificate on next hearing date which was fixed for May 31. This case is to be taken up for argument before two-judge-bench comprising Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena on next hearing date.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General.
