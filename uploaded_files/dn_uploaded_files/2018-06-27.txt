Understand noble truth of Dhamma
Buddhism is the greatest philosophy to enrich one's spirituality. The four sublime states of the mind; Metta, Karuna, Muditha and Upekkha, which stand for loving-kindness, compassion, appreciative joy and equanimity, teach us peace, reconciliation and spiritual calmness through the teachings of the Buddha, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking Poson.
The message added: During the 3rd Century BC, Arahant Mahinda introduced the doctrine of Buddhism on a Poson Full Moon Day. From this moment, we inherited new knowledge which enabled our society to flourish.
The philosophy of Buddhism is accepted today and it will be accepted for many more years to come. Dhamma is not limited to this world, but absorbed in other dimensions of the world where Buddhists seek the supreme bliss of Nibbana.
I believe that it is our utmost responsibility to understand the noble truth of Dhamma and to apply this to our daily lives.
Let us therefore, on this significant Poson Full Moon Poya Day, return to this eternal truth so that we can shed light on our way of thinking and achieve a deeper understanding of that which is so far unknown.

Urban Regeneration Programme for poorest in SL cities
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that the main focus of the concept of sustainable cities should be on serving the poorest segments of society by providing better living and working conditions for them by ensuring affordable housing, healthcare, water, sanitation and electricity.
The Minister said that in partnership with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the government will implement the Urban Regeneration Programme which aims at relocating 50,000 low and lower middle-income households living in slums and shanties in Colombo city into new apartments.
Minister Samaraweera made these remarks at the Third Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors Business Roundtable of the AIIB held in Mumbai, India.
The Minister reiterated the governments commitment to achieving sustainable development in urban areas, while taking various policy measures to uplift the living conditions of the poor.
We introduced sustainable development strategies that pave the way to achieve our Vision for 2025 that envisages a country enriched with a higher per capita income over US$ 5,000, he said. In addition, we initiated a project to reduce vulnerability to landslides, aiming at implementing mitigation measures and thereby minimising damage from landslides.
It is evident that both the frequency of occurrence of disasters and their severity have been increasing in the recent past.

Agro-based industries: A guide to investors
Agro-based industries are important for a developing country for its economic prosperity. They lead to the creation of forward and backward linkages of the development process on a large scale, by making agriculture and industries mutually complementary. On the other hand, the development of agro-based industries can help realise various linkages or interrelationships between industry and agriculture. If agro-based industries are developed, it will help create new markets for agricultural produce and reduce post-harvest losses. This will mitigate unrest among the farmer communities due to lack of markets and demand for their produce.
At the same time, it will be possible to generate new employment opportunities on a large scale in the rural sector. In addition, the broad-based development of the agro-products industry will improve both social and physical infrastructure. Therefore, development of this sector is important in terms of the growth of Sri Lankas productive capacity, national income, employment and foreign exchange.
However, it was observed that a lot of factors have to be considered for a viable, sustainable, successful and profitable industry before investing. Therefore, this article attempts to propose a set of guidelines which can be used to direct investors before investing. The guide is based on the lessons learnt and from the literature review. Eighteen themes were identified to make the guide and it is advisable to analyse the feasibility of a project prior to making any critical decisions. At the same time, involvement of a multidisciplinary team to conduct the feasibility analysis is also important. In the feasibility analysis, all the parameters should be used to make the decisions and it is not advisable to make decisions by looking at only few parameters.
i. Location
Agro-based industries should be mainly located based on the availability of raw material and if they are in rural areas, they help to develop the rural economy as well.
ii. Land and building requirement
It is recommended to have the land in an industrial zone as such zones offer many other benefits. It is also recommended to construct the building as it will facilitate installing of machines in an appropriate manner. Further, land and building for a proposed industry can be acquired on rent or ownership.
iii. Utility requirement
Facilities such as electricity, water and communication are essential utilities for an industry and therefore, locations where those facilities are available at affordable rates and with easy access are desirable.
iv. Transport facilities
Mode of transport, easy access to the factory from other areas and from factory to other areas and means of transport can be considered as transport facilities. Attention should be paid to ensure the availability of these facilities as the sustainability of an industry depends on this as well.
v. Appropriate technology and production process flow
Technology used to produce a product or technology to manage the regular operations of an industry can be identified as appropriate technology. The help of technical experts has to be obtained to identify the appropriate technology and to monitor and maintain the production process flow at an efficient and effective level. At the same time, technological issues that could affect the industry have to be considered too.
vi. Machinery requirement
The identification of machinery requirement is another key factor and suitable machinery and equipment have to be obtained from local or international markets at competitive rates.
vii. Availability of raw material
To identify the continuous availability of raw materials for an industry, major supplying areas, storage facilities, consumption, current industrial usage, post-harvest losses, and exports and imports have to be considered critically with respect to the time of the year. Further, it is desirable to analyse data for at least 10 years and make forecasts for at least five years, while identifying the trends.
In addition, the scattered nature of available raw materials also requires attention in the planning and implementation stages of the project to make a well-established mechanism to obtain the surplus of raw material at a focal point. On the other hand, crop surplus during the harvest season also inevitably results in irregular supply of raw materials. This factor too, therefore, needs special attention at the planning stage.
viii. Technical appropriateness of available raw material
With respect to agro produce, parameters such as variety, composition, colour and size determine the technical appropriateness of raw material for an industry. Therefore, the support of technical experts should be obtained to identify the suitable indicators and raw materials for an industry, and at the same time, attention has to be paid to critically recognise the varieties cultivated by farmers. If not, this factor may result in a failed project.
ix. Accessibility of raw material
Regular supply of raw materials at a sufficient level throughout the required period is considered as accessibility and it is one of the key factors in the success of an industry.
Therefore, a mechanism of obtaining raw materials at the factory has to be developed with much attention and a comprehensive study has to be conducted for this. The proposed mechanism should touch on the following: scattered nature of raw materials; attitudes, perceptions and behaviour of farmers; strong linkages and continuous dialogue with farmers; and obtaining support of existing groups and societies such as farmer societies and local officials working with farmers. It is also important to have a written document or registry or agreement with farmers with precautions in case of violations of agreements. Further it is necessary to have staff to coordinate, follow up, monitor and supervise regularly at the field, attend to issues immediately, and give inputs at the right time, systematically collect the harvest, and make payments on time. External factors such as the availability of infrastructure facilities and collecting centres and regular discussions with stakeholders, at the right time are also vital. Therefore, accessibility would not be an issue if there is a well-developed collecting mechanism.
x. Affordability of raw material
Poor understanding of the raw material market makes business unprofitable as the high cost of production makes the products not competitive in the market.
To decide the affordability of raw materials for an industry, it is important to analyse the prices of the raw materials in the open market. A study on the wholesale prices for a period of time would help understand the average prices and price trends in the open market. At the same time, prices depend on the availability of products and the domestic demand at any given time. Therefore, all the causes and effects on production and demand also have to be studied to understand price fluctuations. Generally, the supply of raw materials is not stable throughout the year and as a result, there can be huge variations in the prices. Therefore, it is recommended to estimate the raw material requirement for the year and this should be contracted for in advance with the suppliers for the industry so as to be unaffected by drastic changes in the prices of raw materials.
xi. Other fixed asset requirements
A list of other essential fixed assets required for an industry to conduct operations smoothly has to be identified and attention should be paid with much concern to obtain quality assets in a competitive environment.
xii. Human resource requirement
Attention has to be paid to identify the manpower requirement first, and secondly, to recruit the ideal technical experts, skilled labour, unskilled labour, management staff, field staff and sales staff.
xiii. Marketing of the product
Marketing of the product of an industry mainly depends on demand and supply forces. Demand can be either existing demand or created demand. If it is existing demand, the entire demand and the level of the demand which is fulfilled already have to be studied. If it is created demand, strategies that create the demand have to be studied first.
After analysing the demand, the availability of products and the accessibility and affordability of buyers for products have to be considered to identify the potential of selling the product in the market at a profitable rate. Therefore, aspects such as industries of similar nature currently in operation (local and foreign), price of the product, perceptions and behaviour of target buyers and marketing and sales strategy have to be analysed critically.
Apart from that, competitors have to be identified along with their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, strategies necessary to deal with the competition are also required. There would be good potential for a new brand if there is a quality product, unique package, a market network, industry understanding, financial soundness and feedback.
xiv. Market entry timing
Various products and services have high dependence on their commercialisation timing and delivery to the customers based either on the availability of raw material or level of demand for the product. Therefore, these factors have to be studied well to identify the perfect market entry time for the industry.
xv. Management of the industry
Management of an industry mainly includes project investment and the legal status of the business. These factors too have to be analysed critically to have a sustainable product line.
The composition of debt and equity is discussed under project investment and the composition of debt and equity can be changed according to the requirement of the investor. Ownership and business registration come under the business legal status. Ownership can be proprietorship or a partnership and it can be registered under the Companies Ordinance, or as a BOI project. The advantages and disadvantages of different types of ownership should be studied and the best should be selected for the industry.
xvi. External factors
A study on the relevant public sector entities will help identify the advantages and benefits which can be obtained from the public sector, as well as identify the existing rules and regulations in order to maintain the viability of the industry. Further, an analysis on the available tax reliefs, subsidies and other opportunities available to encourage investments can be used to reap benefits from those opportunities.
A study on both state and local level environmental laws will help describe the regulations and environmental issues that a company needs to address and it is important for an industry to justify that they follow the existing rules and regulations.
Social, political and economic risks in a country and around the location where an industry is to be set up have to be studied carefully to minimise the vulnerability of a newly established industry.
xvii. Coordination and integration among stakeholders
The absence of proper integration among various agencies and lack of coordination between regulatory bodies and industry have been identified as one of the shortcomings of the industry sector. In the public sector, there are different ministries and departments working in agriculture, industry, marketing and processing sector, etc. However, poor integration and coordination among these institutes does not allow the country to use its resources productively.
On the other hand, there are technical experts, technologists and field officers attached to those institutes and there are databases maintained with important information. However, lack of coordination and integration result in minimum usage of available knowledge and information and later, result in wrong decisions. At the same time, there are institutes in the private sector and in the non-governmental sector rich in relevant knowledge and information. Therefore, proper coordination and integration among the relevant institutes in the public, private and non-governmental sectors would lead the investors to make more accurate decisions and thereby get the maximum use of the available resources.
xviii. Monitoring and supervision
Attention should be paid to establishing a mechanism for the continuous monitoring and supervision of all the project activities at regular intervals. For that, the required resources such as human resources, time and money have to be estimated in advance and a space needs to be reserved for this in the projects activity plan. At the same time, there should be a mechanism to provide remedies for issues if any, without any delay, to ensure the smooth function of the project.

Poson Day messages
Be disciplined in mind, body and speech: President
Within a setting where most milestones of human civilization were noted with the power of weapons, the festival of Poson, which signifies the glorious message of loving-kindness, brings back the memory of an arrival of a virtuous nation, stated President Maithripala Sirisena, in his message marking Poson Poya Day.
The message added: It is not only the heredity of a new religion that we obtained with the arrival of Arahat Mahinda on a full moon Poya Day such as today in the year 236 B.C., but also a nation nourished by Buddhist cultural values was created based on that significant incident.
Within that, we inherited the rich traditional values of education, literature, architecture, agriculture and most importantly, ethics of life.
It was also the light of Buddhism introduced to us by Arahat Mahinda that moved us towards a lifestyle and a tradition that is endowed with a co-existing policy to provide protection for the environment not only for the humankind but also for fauna and flora, rivers and torrents.
It is with the aid of Buddhist consciousness treasured in our hearts that we generated the greatest strength to rise from major challenges as a nation that we faced later without suffering major setbacks.
Thus, as a nation listening to Buddhist preaching under a shade of a mango tree on a Poya day such as today, we must determine to be disciplined within mind, body and speech to dedicate ourselves to bring virtue to the whole environment, giving priority to humankind.
I wish you all a virtuous day of Poson!

The Bracegirdle embarrassment
Friends, you have dark skins, but white hearts- while my people here have white skins but their hearts are packed with black treason of such a nature that even an infected rat would despise to dwell in their hearts
Bracegirdle addressing a group of estate workers
Mark Anthony Lyster Bracegirdle began his career as a trainee at Relugas Estate in Madulkele, in Matale District, under Superintendent H D Thomas. The horrible condition of the estate workers life really shocked him. The imported shipments of labour from South India had to walk hundreds of miles from Thalaimannar to the central hills, a tough trek across the countrys dry zone where thousands died on the way.
Don Philip Rupasinhe Gunawardena, the son of Boralugoda Ralahamy of Awissawella, was a student of Economics at the University of Illinois in America. Philip later travelled to Britain where he met a few local students at London University including Colvin R de Silva, Nanayakkarage Martin Perera and Leslie Goonewardena all being students of Professor Harold Lasky the Marxist. They became the members of an international socialite organisation named League Against Imperialism and For National Independence. Returning to the motherland in the mid-1930s, they formed the LSSP (Lanka Sama Samaja Party) and contested four seats in the 1936 parliamentary election winning two seats. Philip Gunawardena and N M Perera were elected to represent Awissawella and Ruwanwella in the State Council.
Bracegirdle, born in England in 1912, migrated to Sydney with parents and studied Agriculture. He joined the Communist Party of Australia before he sailed for Ceylon to learn tea planting. The British planters in the tea estate areas lived a luxury life on posh bungalows with several servants while the workers were treated appallingly in cattle-shed-type line rooms. They were deprived of proper health services and education. Good-looking and very young female workers were compelled to provide sexual favours to the planters.
Injustice
Bracegirdle experienced numerous instances of unfair treatment meted out to the poor workers by the European planters. His boss, Thomas, would go to the line rooms to force the workers to go to work despite some suffering from malaria or its effects. Thomas would be adamant about them picking tea. They prevented the children from going to school, instead wanted them to work in the estate. When Bracegirdle protested, Thomas had told: Learning was only copying us, and it does them no good at all and worse it will give them ideas in later life.
Thomas admonished him for keeping a close association with the coolies. Bracegirdles stubbornness created trouble in the estate. He fought for workers rights when Thomas discontinued the service of some labourers who had close dealings with Bracegirdle, compelling the management not only to sack him unceremoniously but give him a ticket to return to Australia. Bracegirdle left the estate and travelled to Colombo where he met the LSSP stalwarts and joined the organisation as an activist.
Bracegirdle became an asset to the young Marxists of Samasamajist anti-colonial activities, who contributed regularly to their newsprint, while the CID kept a watchful eye on the LSSPs behaviour. The young activist played a leading role in organising a public rally on Galle Face Green summoned by LSSP in January 1937 to celebrate Sir Dowbiggin's departure. The atrocities committed during Dowbiggin's tenure as IGP during the 1915 riots prompted them to hold it. In March, the same year he was admitted to the politburo of the party.
The LSSP had a public meeting in Colombo in November 1937, where Bracegirdle was billed to speak. Colvin R de Silva, the president of the party who was in the chair, introduced him as the first white comrade ever to address a party meeting. This was followed by quite a few meetings held at various locations in the city. Later he travelled to Nawalapitiya to join a trade union organised by the plantation's workers, where a senior LSSPer, Dr NM Perera, introduced him to the crowd as a white comrade who generously consented to work for them. The crowds were overjoyed when Bracegirdle announced that they are well organised to fight the whites with two of their members already in the State Council, and also several lawyers who will appear free of charge for labour cases. CID sleuths kept a close watch on the proceedings and reported directly not only the words spoken by Bracegirdle but the workers response to the IGP. Governor Stubbs duly signed an order on April 20 to deport Bracegirdle which was served on him two days later. He was allowed only two days to pack his bags as passage had been booked for him already.
The LSSP took a decision to act against this order and to hide the man. The job was entrusted with Philips Brother Robert, a keen activist. For ten days, they hid Bracegirdle at various locations in Colombo, Lunugala and Uva. Bracegirdle, disguised as a woman, travelled with Samasamajist comrades. In Colombo, Robert left Bracegirdle at a house at Kosgashandiya, Grandpass. From there, after a few days, Bracegirdle was taken to Kaduwela where he remained until May 5. The LSSP drummed up support for cancelling the deportation order. The May Day procession was full of hoardings that read Keep Bracegirdle  Deport Stubbs. Finally, they announced that Bracegirdle would appear at a mass rally on Galle Face Green H D Thomas.
The deportation order was debated by State Council on May 4 and 5, in which several members spoke in support of the motion criticising the Governor for acting on contrary to the constitution.
State Council Debate
Siripala Samarakkody:
HE the Governor had acted unconstitutionally and in violation of the expressed terms of the constitution that has been granted to us by the Donoughmore Commission, and as such, such action shall be condemned by this house, should not be tolerated in this country, and every protest must be made in order to safeguard the rights and liberties of the subjects.
There has been a gross violation, a gross abuse, a gross invasion. If we allow this action to go unchallenged, and if we do not exert all powers that is within us to see that orders are rescinded it will be very unsafe for us. It is very clear that there is no vestige of responsible government in the country.
George E de Silva:
and today thanks to the activities of the Samasamaja Party, an unfortunate person called Mr Bracegirdle .a pure Englishmen, a man who has been born and bred in a land of liberties comes to this country and feels that an injustice is being done to the people of this country and tries to bring to the minds of the English people who are in the country their responsibility towards the people.
For stating that he wants fair play and justice done to the people of this country, he is to be bundled out. Is that British justice Hansard - May 4, 1937: folio 919
A few nominated Europeans spoke defending the action of Governor Stubbs. However, it was passed with only six Noes against 34 Ayes which included GG Ponnammbalam, S W R D Bandaranaike, Susantha de Fonseka, R S Tennakoon, D M Rajapaksa, Siripala Samarakkody, George E de Silva, A E Goonesinghe, Philip Gunawardena and N M Perera. The LSSP leaders left the chamber immediately to attend the mass rally at Galle Face Green. Robert Gunawardena drove his car through the police cordon and stopped near the platform to let the wanted man out. The Young Anglo-Australian, Bracegirdle, appeared in person on stage.
He was castigated a traitor because he took the side of the oppressed masses the British Raj violated the Indian Labourers Wages ordinance. Liberty and justice cannot be decided by colour, thundered the LSSPers.
Deportation invalidated
The Police did not attempt to arrest him in the midst of a massive crowd. Later while staying at an LSSP leaders house, the Police took him, planning to put him on board the steamer. HV Perera, a senior civil lawyer assisted by 30-year old Colvin, applied for a writ of habeas corpus. The lawyers offered services free. A bench of three judges issued judgment:  the deportation order was illegal, humiliating the colonial government.
The case received extensive publicity through the British Empire. Governor Stubbs resigned on June 30 to be replaced by Caldecott. IGP Banks was removed. The Bracegirdle embarrassment caused such an upsurge of opinion that Governor Caldecott commenced the process of constitutional reforms leading to the establishment of Soulbury Constitution.

Civil Society members demo against attempts to send back children to Darun Nusra
A silent demonstration was held opposite the Nugegoda Magistrates Court today, against the Probation Department and the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA), for attempting to send children back to Darun Nusra, a childrens home where these children had been sexually harassed.
The demonstration was organized by members of the Civil Society, condemning the response of the NCPA and Probation Department concerning this matter.
The Attorney Lakmali Hemachandra who represented the victims, said the children could not be returned to Darun Nusra, adding that the problem was that State Institutions had failed to find suitable government schools for the children affected to continue with their education.
Hemachandra said that during Police investigations, it was revealed that a male staffer of this home (Matrons husband) was allegedly committing sexual offences, while both the Matron and Dr. Mareena Reffai , the founder of the Almuslimaath Foundation, which oversees the orphanage were aware of it, but had not taken any action.
The Civil Society members in a statement said that despite the ongoing investigations into the allegations of abuse, which not only include the alleged abuser but also the matron and the founder of Al- Muslimaath, the Probation officers had vehemently opposed the calls by activists for the children to be transferred out of Darun Nusra for their own safety.
They further stated that the Courts instructed the Probation Department and the NCPA to find suitable schools for the children, but for for the last three months, both institutions had taken no concrete action.
Instead, we were informed that a meeting called by the NCPA with the guardians and Probation officers in June 2018, the guardians had been either pressured to take the children back home or return them to Darun Nusra if they wished to continue with their education.
Hemachandra said that they had requested Court for the best interests of the children, to avoid sending them back, adding that the case would be taken up again on June 5.

## Title: Devotion in Buddhism
## Supertitle:

Devotion in Buddhism
The Buddha repeatedly discouraged any excessive veneration paid to him personally. He knew that an excess of purely emotional devotion can obstruct or disturb the development of a balanced character, and thus may become a serious obstacle to progress on the path to deliverance. The history of religion has since proved him right, as illustrated by the extravagancies of emotional mysticism in East and West.
The suttas relate the story of the monk Vakkali, who full of devotion and love for the Buddha, was ever desirous to behold him bodily. To him the Buddha said: What shall it profit you to see this impure body He who sees the Dhamma, sees me.
Worthiest homage
Shortly before the Buddha passed away, he said: If a monk or a nun, a devout man or a devout woman, lives in accordance with the Dhamma, is correct in his life, walks in conformity with the Dhamma  it is he who rightly honors, reverences, venerates, holds sacred and reveres the Perfect One (tathagata) with the worthiest homage.
A true and deep understanding of the Dhamma, together with a conduct that is in conformity with that understanding  these are vastly superior to any external homage or mere emotional devotion. That is the instruction conveyed by these two teachings of the Master.
It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that the Buddha disparaged a reverential and devotional attitude of mind when it is the natural outflow of a true understanding and a deep admiration of what is great and noble. It would also be a grievous error to believe that the seeing of the Dhamma (spoken of in the first saying) is identical with a mere intellectual appreciation and purely conceptual grasp of the doctrine.
Such a one-sided abstract approach to the very concrete message of the Buddha all too often leads to intellectual smugness. In its barrenness it will certainly not be a substitute for the strong and enlivening impulse imparted by a deep-felt devotion to what is known as great, noble and exemplary.
Devotion, being a facet and natural accompaniment of confidence (saddha), is a necessary factor in the balance of faculties (indriya-samata) required for final deliverance. Confidence, in all its aspects, including the devotional, is needed to resolve any stagnation and other shortcomings resulting from a one-sided development of the intellectual faculties. Such development often tends to turn around in circles endlessly, without being able to effect a break-through.
Here, devotion, confidence and faith  all aspects of the Pali term saddha  may be able to give quick and effective help.
Personality cult
Though the Buddha refused to be made the object of an emotional personality cult, he also knew that respect and homage paid to those who are worthy of it, is a great blessing. The Buddha made this statement in the very first stanza of one of his principal ethical injunctions, the Discourse on Blessings (Maha-Mangala Sutta). Mentioning the value of a respectful, reverential attitude together with the blessings avoiding fools and associating with the wise, the Buddha obviously regarded such an attitude as fundamental for individual and social progress and for the acquisition of any further higher benefits. One who is incapable of a reverential attitude will also be incapable of spiritual progress beyond the narrow limits of his present mental condition. One who is so blind as not to see or recognize anything higher and better than the little mud-pool of his petty self and environment will suffer for a long time from retarded growth. And one who, out of a demonstrative self-assertion, scorns a reverential attitude in himself and in others will remain imprisoned in his self-conceit  a most formidable bar to a true maturity of character and to spiritual growth. It is by recognizing and honoring someone or something higher that one honors and enhances ones own inner potentialities.
When the high heart we magnify, And the sure vision celebrate, And worship greatness passing by, Ourselves are great.
Since respect, reverence and devotion are partial aspects of the Buddhist concept of confidence, one will now understand why confidence has been called the seed of all other beneficial qualities.
The nobler the object of reverence or devotion, the higher is the blessing bestowed by it. Those who have joyous confidence in the highest, the highest fruit will be theirs (AN 4.34). The supreme objects of a Buddhists reverence and devotion are his Three Refuges, also called the Three Jewels or Ideals: the Buddha, his Teaching (Dhamma) and the Community of saintly monks and nuns (Sangha). Here, too, the Buddha is revered not as a personality of such a name, nor as a deity, but as the embodiment of Enlightenment.
Reasoned conviction
A text often recurring in the Buddhist scriptures says that a devout lay disciple has confidence, he believes in the Enlightenment of the Perfect One. This confidence, however, is not the outcome of blind faith based on hearsay, but is derived from the devotees reasoned conviction based on his own understanding of the Buddha Word which speaks to him clearly with a voice of unmistakable Enlightenment. This derivation of his assurance is emphasized by the fact that, along with confidence, wisdom also is mentioned among the qualities of an ideal lay follower.
We may now ask: Is it not quite natural that feelings of love, gratitude, reverence and devotion seek expression through the entire personality, through acts of body and speech as well as through our thoughts and unexpressed sentiments Will one, for instance, hide ones feelings towards parents and other loved ones Will one not rather express them by loving words and deeds Will one not cherish their memory in suitable ways, as for instance, by preserving their pictures in ones home, by placing flowers on their graves, by recalling their noble qualities In such a way, one who has become critical of the devotional aspects of religion may seek to understand the outward acts of homage customary in Buddhist lands when, with reverential gesture, flowers and incense are placed before a Buddha image and devotional texts are recited not as prayers but as meditation. Provided that such practice does not deteriorate into a thoughtless routine, a follower of the Dhamma will derive benefit if he takes up some form of a devotional practice, adapting it to his personal temperament and to the social customs of his environment. Buddhism however, does not in the least impose upon its followers a demand to observe any outward form of devotion or worship. This is entirely left to the choice of individuals whose emotional, devotional and intellectual needs are bound to differ greatly. No Buddhist should feel himself forced into an iron-cast mould, be it of a devotional or a rationalistic shape. As a follower of the middle way, he should, however, also avoid one-sided judgment of others, and try to appreciate that their individual needs and preferences may differ from his own.
More important and of greater general validity than outward forms of devotion is the basic capacity for respect and reverence discussed at the beginning of this essay, and also the practice of meditations or contemplations of a devotional character. Many benefits accrue from these and hence it was for good reasons that the Enlightened One strongly and repeatedly recommended the meditative recollection of the Buddha (buddhanussati), along with other kindred devotional recollections. Here again, the reference is to the embodied ideal; thus the Buddha, as a being freed from all traces of vanity and egotism, could venture to recommend to his disciples a meditation on the Buddha.
What, then, are the benefits of such devotional meditations Their first benefit is mental purification. They have been called by the Buddha efficacious procedures for purifying a defiled mind (AN 3.71). When a noble disciple contemplates upon the Enlightened One, at that time his mind is not enwrapped in lust, nor in hatred, nor in delusion. At such a time his mind is rightly directed: it has got rid of lust, is aloof from it, is freed from it. Lust is here a name for the five sense desires. By cultivating this contemplation, many beings become purified (AN 6.25).
Positive reaction
If, by practicing that devotional meditation, one endeavors to live, as it were, in the Masters presence (sattha sammukhibhuta), one will feel ashamed to do, speak or think anything unworthy; one will shrink back from evil; and as a positive reaction, one will feel inspired to high endeavor in emulation of the Masters great example.
Images, and not abstract concepts, are the language of the subconscious. If, therefore, the image of the Enlightened One is often created within ones mind as the embodiment of man perfected, it will penetrate deeply into the subconscious, and if sufficiently strong, will act as an automatic brake against evil impulses. In such a way the subconscious, normally so often the hidden enemy in gaining self-mastery, may become a powerful ally of such an endeavor. For that purpose of educating the subconscious, it will be helpful to use a Buddha image or picture as an aid in visualization. In that way concentration of mind may be attained fairly soon. For evoking and deeply absorbing some features of the Buddhas personality, his qualities should be contemplated, for instance in the way described in the Visuddhimagga.
The recollection of the Buddha, being productive of joy (piti), is an effective way of invigorating the mind, of lifting it up from the states of listlessness, tension, fatigue, and frustration, which occur during meditation as well as in ordinary life.

The dilemma of the sixteen
It was quite obvious even to a political novice, where the 16 SLFP rebels would end up when they decided to quit the Unity Government, following the abortive No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Despite their posturings that although they left the government, unable to be part of a regime that had the UNP as a partner, and yet they would still remain members of the Sirisena faction of the SLFP, it was plain from the day the LG election results were out, which way the wind was blowing. It was equally plain that the rebels were loath to give up their ministerial portfolios. We say this because Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara continued to insist that only the President could remove him from office, when the UNP back benchers would not hear of those who voted in favour of the No Confidence Motion to oust the Premier remaining in the Cabinet, while Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala too arguing on the same lines although telling the media that he sent his resignation to the President.
Now the inevitable has come to pass. It was reported in an English daily yesterday that ten out of the 16 SLFP rebels would join the Joint Opposition before the next parliament sittings, on July 03, and they would also take part in the Parliamentary Group meeting of the JO next week. It was also reported that these ten members would seek to persuade their other colleagues who are undecided, to join with them in their flight to the JO. It is well known that Messrs S.B. Dissanayake and Dayasiri Jayasekara are reluctant to take the plunge and had wanted the rest to stay put in the SLFP while entering into a working relationship with the JO, both, inside and outside parliament.
However, it appears that the rebel group of ten have had enough of remaining in isolation. Being neither here nor there may not have fitted into the restless nature of the likes of Susil Premajayantha and Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, both former General Secretaries of the UPFA and SLFP, respectively.
However, the question remains if the rebels will be welcomed into the Joint Opposition fold, given the hostility shown towards them by the likes of Basil Rajapaksa and Prasanna Ranatunga who walked the gauntlet being hauled before various courts, while the rebels were firmly ensconced in the seats of power. In fact Basil R., the other day, made some very uncomplimentary remarks about the rebels to the effect that they(JO) were not prepared to accommodate anyone who enjoyed the crumbs, while in government, aanduwe idang mas katu sooppu karapu aya ganda api sudanam ne.
In any event, the JO has ruled out accommodating the rebels so long as they remain members of the SLFP. This is on the basis that the Blues were in partnership with the Greens in governance. Although the group of 16 quit the government, some of them were recently appointed office bearers in the SLFP by President Sirisena. JO spokesman Dullas Alahapperuma opined that the group of 16 could not hope to serve both the SLFP and the JO simultaneously.
Going by all accounts, the SLFP rebels are going to receive the cold shoulder from the JO. MPs of the JO are also all too aware that had the LG polls results been any different those who now claim they could not serve in a coalition government which had the UNP as the other partner, would have continued to remain in the same government holding ministerial office and enjoying all the perks and privileges.
Besides, the rebels campaigned against the JO at the LG poll, although the likes of Dayasiri Jayasekara and Susil Premajayantha took care to keep their options open by playing footsie with Mahinda Rajapaksa. Needless to say, this ploy of trying to have the best of both worlds obviously was not lost on those like Prasanna Ranatunga who continues to oppose any rapprochement with the rebels. He has good reason to do so. Should the rebels worm their way into the JO they would have to be accommodated on the JO nomination lists at the next general election which would be out of the question for many in the JO as this would be at the expense of many of their dedicated members who braved the odds to remain loyal to the Rajapaksas.
In any event, the chances of any of them being returned are slim, given their association with the UNP led government, albeit for a brief period. Even in the event they receive nominations they are bound to walk into a hostile reception from JO stalwarts who will ensure their defeat by enjoining the voters ignore the renegades. This is more so given that Basil Rajapaksa would have a big say in the drawing up of the nomination lists, like he did at the LG poll, and, what is more, lead the campaign. He certainly would not fail to remember the remarks made recently by Dilan Perera describing his (Basil's) nocturnal flight overseas on the night of January 8, when his brother was losing the election.

Encyclopaedia of Buddhism
The Jews started their first one in 1900 and this was joined by the Encyclopaedia Talmudit in 1942. The majesterial 26 volume Encyclopaedia Judaica came out in 1972. The Catholic Encyclopaedia saw the light of day in 1907.
The Encyclopaedia of Islam was first published in 1913 and in 2005 the six volume Encyclopaedia of the Quran was published. Brills Encyclopaedia Islamica, a translation of the magnificent Da'erat-ol-Ma'aref-e Bozorg-e Eslami, is on-going and is projected to take up 16 volumes when finished. And of course the recent Encyclopaedia of Islamic Law in three volumes, and the huge Encyclopaedia of Hadith must not be forgotten. There is even an Encyclopaedia of Hadith Forgeries!
The 11 volume Encyclopaedia of Hinduism has just been published. As with most things, the Christians are ahead of the game. For reasons of space I can mention only a few of their encyclopaedias. The Encyclopaedia Biblica was published in 1899, although I think there were several similar works before this. The Encyclopaedia of Bible Difficulties, Baker Encyclopaedia of Christian Apologetics, The Encyclopaedia of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, A Concise Encyclopaedia of Christianity in India, The World Christian Encyclopaedia, The Encyclopaedia of Christian Civilization, The Encyclopaedia of Christian Theology (3 vols.), The Oxford Encyclopaedia of the Reformation (4 vols.), The Oxford Encyclopaedia of South Asian Christianity (2 vols.), The Oxford Encyclopaedia of the Bible and the Arts, and The Seventh-day Adventist Encyclopaedia (12 vols.).
Everything you could possibly want to know about every aspect of the faith. Even a small sect like the Mormons (4 million members) has its four-volume Encyclopaedia of Mormonism (1992).
Malalasekara initiation
Now we turn to Buddhism. In the early 1950s as the Buddhist world geared up for the Buddha Jayanti the government of Ceylon undertook to publish an Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, an idea that was first broached, I think, by G. P. Malalasekera. Unusually for traditional Buddhists, a great deal of careful thought went into the project.
Specialists in Buddhism from around the world were invited to participate and included big names such as I. B Horner, Giuseppe Tucci, B. C. Law. P. V. Bapat, N. Dutt, Helmut von Glasenapp, and even the likes of Lama Govinda and Christmas Humpherys. The Ceylon government purchased at considerable expense a fine quality acid-free paper for the volumes and made generous contributions to the project.
After careful consideration it was decided that the whole project would need 15000 pages and take 10 years to complete. In 1965 the first volume was complete and proved to be a tour de force. But a perceptive observer might have noticed a problem; that of the project being over-ambitious. It covered the doctrines of all schools, history, art, literature, indeed just about everything related to Buddhism. It was clear that even every book in the Tibetan Tipitaka was going to have a separate entry.
How on earth was all this going to be fitted into 15,000 pages Then there was the problem of being associated with the Ceylon/Sri Lankan government. Political appointments to the editorial staff, cutback of funding, and a general slowness started to take its toll. By volume IV (1979-1987) the project was in serious trouble. This is reflected by the quality of the articles, although some are still excellent, the cutback in the number of articles, the cheap paper, the different font from the earlier volumes and the different size of each volume.
Final volume
Put all the volumes on a shelf and they are all of a different size. And now the output has slowed to a crawl. Recently I asked a former staff member when the final volume was expected to come out; he smiled and said: When the next world-system starts to re-evolve.
Of course with the slow decline of the Sri Lankan Encyclopaedia other attempts have sprung to life. Apart from small efforts on individual Buddhist schools (e.g. An Encyclopaedia of Korean Buddhism and The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Zen Buddhism) we have the new Brills Encyclopaedia of Buddhism which is planned to be in seven volumes and looks promising, the Edward Irons Encyclopaedia of Buddhism, the Thomas Gale Encyclopaedia of Buddhism edited by Robert E. Buswell and Encyclopaedia of Buddhism edited by Damien Keown and Charles Prebish (only 857 pages of entries).
These last three efforts cover the subjects in no more detail than does The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. As if to reinforce the perception of Buddhism being disengaged none of them have an entry on marriage or quite a few other subjects relevant to 99% percent of Buddhists or those wanting to know more about Buddhism.

Police Sergeant killed in Matara shooting;:
Family provided compensation
IGP Pujith Jayasundera yesterday (26) provided compensation of Rs 2.56 million to the wife and children of late Matara Police Sergeant Suranga Pradeep Weerasinghe, who was killed during a recent shootout with armed robbers.
The IGP who was on a visit to attend a World Conference for IGPs in the United States, returned to the island early last morning.
His first task after his return was to visit the dead Sergeants house in Godagama, Matara and express his condolences to the family.
Southern Province Senior DIG, F.Fernando, Matara Division in charge, SP Gayanga Hasantha Marapone and Police Media Spokesperson SP Ruwan Gunasekara were also present on the occasion. The compensation included Rs 1.5 million from the Police Rewards Fund, Rs 1 million from the Agrahara Insurance Fund and Rs 60,000 from the Seva Wanitha Unit Fund.
IGP Jayasundera speaking to late Sergeant Weerasinghes wife; Saumya Kumari Abeywickrama (33), said her daughter Methuli Dulanya (5), and son Mathila Nethsala (3), would not have lost their father if he was wearing a bullet proof vest. Thus, in future he would make it mandatory that all officers who undertake such operations to wear a bullet-proof vest to avoid such unfortunate incidents. He added that all officers undertaking such operations had been provided with bullet-proof vests but in this instance, given the urgency of the situation, the officers had left without wearing them. In future, he said he would make it mandatory.

Film Corporation ex-employees union lauds distribution decision
The decision taken by the government to restore the right of distribution of films to the National Film Corporation would augur well to ensure a bright future for the local cinema industry and staff of the National Film Corporation, states the National Film Corporation ex-employees union in a press release issued on June 21.
The removal of the right of distribution from the Film Corporation nearly two decades ago, not only sent the local film industry into deep crisis, but also denied film goers the opportunity to view quality films, the release signed by union President N.H. Ratnapala said.
The decision taken by the government to restore this right to the Corporation, even belatedly, is highly appreciated by the union members who are in retirement.
While thanking Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe and his ministry for taking this bold decision, the statement wished him and the Chairman and Board of Directors of the Film Corporation strength and courage to cater to the welfare of the local film industry without falling prey to the machinations of cunning and opportunist sections.

Money laundering case against Mahindananda:
Further trial fixed for July 9
A case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo, over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money, was yesterday taken up before the Colombo High Court.
The Court of Appeal had issued an order transferring this case to another court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga fixed the matter for a calling date on July 9, since the order of the Court of Appeal had not been received by the High Court.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo, from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs.27 million.
The Attorney General alleged that the accused failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house, and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under Sections 3 and 4 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the Convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty with Counsel Hafeel Farisz, Thusitha Ranasinghe, Tharandi Wijayapura and Dinesh Silva appeared for the accused.

Govt all out to contain underworld - MP
The government is doing its best to mitigate and control underworld activities and the UNP does not have any connection to any underworld activities. If anyone is against its mitigation, they would be against the countrys justice system, MP Thushara Indunil Amarasena said.
Speaking at a press briefing held at Sirikotha yesterday, the MP said that many members of the Joint Opposition had ties with the underworld which are the reasons for the recent shootings of Karandeniya Vice Chairman Donald Sampath and Dehiwala - Mount Lavinia Municipal Councillor K. Ranjan de Silva.
They were killed due to their ties with the underworld which is not the case with the UNP, he said.
Many criticise the partys agreement with the LTTE and say that the party is pro LTTE. However, the UNP did not pay the LTTE large sums of money and bring LTTE leaders to Temple Trees and offer them high ranking places in 2005 as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa did, which prevented our party from winning the Presidential elections then. If there is any LTTE activity, we will thwart it as evident from the arrest of the persons transporting weapons recently, the MP said.
He criticised the actions of the Joint Opposition of electing members of the same family when there are many senior politicians. The UNP has many senior politicians with high potential and do not count on a family to win the presidential election, Amarasena said.

Hajj Committee refutes allegations
The Hajj Committee yesterday hit back at allegations of corruption levelled against them and stated that these allegations were motivated by agents who had not received a quota to take pilgrims to Mecca.
The All Ceylon Hajj Organisations Vice President Dr M.S.M. Mohammad had held a media briefing last week alleging that the Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs Minister M.H.M. Haleem and the Committee were working together to swindle millions from unsuspecting pilgrims.
Minister Haleem addressing a media briefing at the Ministry held together with Hajj operators and the Committee, said during the last three years, several unscrupulous operators have become disgruntled with the Ministry as it rolled out a more regularized system of handling Hajj pilgrims every year. In addition, they have also managed to bring down the fee for pilgrimage from Rs 7-800,000 to Rs 4.5-500,000.
Dr. Mohammad had alleged that the Minister had appointed his brother to the Hajj Committee, the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs charged Rs 4,000 as service charges instead of just Rs 2,000, had charged Rs 1,44,000 each, last year for the extra 600 pilgrims above the quota and not issued receipts and was only allocating pilgrim quotas for those who curried favour with the Minister.
Haj Committee Chairman, M.T. Ziyad Mohamed explained that all Haj operations were handled by travel operators and that the Committee only decided on policy, the Committee strongly felt that by awarding of a fixed number of quota (pilgrims) to each operator, gave the latter a monopoly in deciding the price as well as selecting the pilgrims. So we decided to select the operators as well as the pilgrims through a proper registration system. This in turn gives the option to the pilgrims to select the operator under a free market system.
Ziyad Mohamed further explained that they had received the additional 600 quota last year, just a week before the pilgrimage started and thus they charged the Rs 1,44,000 as the regular administrative fee which had to be paid to Saudi officials.

Holding PC elections under old electoral system:
House needs to pass amendments with two thirds majority
If Provincial Council Elections are to be held under the old electoral system, legal amendments in that regard have to be passed in Parliament with a two thirds majority, National Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya had stated.
Deshapriya had made this observation at a meeting he had with political party representatives yesterday, at the Election Secretariat.
Deshapriya had pointed out that even if the PC Elections are to be conducted under the new electoral system, a number of technical errors in the legislation had to be corrected prior to elections. Legislation to give effect to a new electoral system, which is a hybrid of First Past the Post system and Proportional Representation system, was adopted in the House last year.
JVP Western Provincial Councillor Attorney-at-Law Sunil Watagala, who took part in the meeting, told the Daily News yesterday, that the Election Commission Chairman expressed the Commissions deep concerns over the delay in holding the PC elections.
Special attention was drawn to the fact as to what system must be adopted in the PC elections. Deshapriya urged political party representatives present at the meeting to push the political authority to bring in the necessary legal amendments as soon as possible to hold the already delayed PC elections. Those who attended the meeting agreed to write to the Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha, to express their disapproval for the postponement of elections, Watagala said.
Deshapriya at the meeting had also stressed that those who live in rented or leased houses would be given the opportunity to include their names in the Electoral Register this time, despite that move could be resisted by house owners. Deshapriya explained that registering their names in the Electoral Register did not mean that they could claim ownership of the property. He had also informed Party representatives that the upcoming PC elections would be conducted under the revised Electoral Register.
Parliament is to take up a full day Adjournment debate on the PC Elections on July 6, as dissenting views had come up at the last Party Leaders Meeting on the PC electoral system. The party leaders meeting ended inconclusively on June 21.

Interpol will hand over Udayanga - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Interpol will take former Ambassador Udayanga Weerathunga into custody and hand him over to the Sri Lankan authorities in accordance with measures taken by the government.
Weerathunga, who is on an international police warrant on charges of monetary misconduct involving the MIG fighter jet deal played a major role as the former Sri Lankan Ambassador in Russia during the last regime.
The PM said that no one intervened to bring Weerathunga to the country but Interpol will take measures to take him into custody on the governments initiative.
The Prime Minister said MP Mahinda Rajapaksa, who maintains close connection with Weerathunga even to this day, may not have any obstacle to bring him into the country, the Prime Minister said so while talking with Ministers after the Cabinet Meeting yesterday.
At this discussion Ministers had referred to Rajapaksas utterance that he (Rajapaksa) would bring Weerathunga into country and simultaneously Prime Minister Wickremasinghe should bring former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran also into the country.
The Prime Minister in reply said that Rajapaksa is able to bring Weerathunga to the country since he had been associating with Weerathunga throughout his hide-out period but he (the Prime Minister) is not able to bring in Mahendran to the country since he had no connections with Mahendran after he left the post.
The PM said that even though Hitlers brother had connections with a person, who had international warrants, he (the Prime Minister) never did such illegal acts. Therefore, he did not maintain any contact with Mahendran since he left the Central Bank Governors post.
Answering a question raised by JVP leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake in Parliament recently, the Prime Minister said the Government had sought Interpol assistance to bring in not only Udayanga Weerathunga, but also former United States Ambassador Jaliya Wickremasuriya and Arjun Mahendran to Sri Lanka.

Kerosene filling units for all boat anchorages: Wedaarachchi
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Wedaarachchi, addressing a gathering of state officials, said that every boat anchorage in the island would be installed with kerosene filling units for the benefit of low-income fisherfolk.
He said that ornamental fish-breeding as well as lobster and prawn-breeding would be boosted as there was a big demand for them in the international market.
Minor tanks in every district would be renovated to boost the fresh water fish industry, the minister said, adding that industries connected to the fishing industry would also be provided assistance and incentives. Newly-appointed District Secretary Bandula Harischandra was also present.

King Ashoka the Great and his memorable edicts
Today we celebrate the arrival of Arahant Mahinda and the introduction of Buddha Dhamma in Sri Lanka. This event was the outcome of the dissemination programme of the Buddha Dhamma by the great Indian King Ashoka, the third monarch of the Mauryan dynasty.
He has come to be regarded as one of the most exemplary rulers in world history. The British historian H.G. Wells has written: Amidst the tens of thousands of names of monarchs that crowd the columns of history ... the name of Ashoka shines, and shines almost alone, a star.
Ashoka ruled over India from 273 to 232 B.C., and it was an India that comprised not only most of what we know as India today, from the Himalayas to almost as far down in the peninsula as Chennai, but also Afghanistan, Baluchistan, Kashmir and Nepal. It may even have extended across the mountains into Chinese Turkestan.
After King Ashoka embraced the teachings of the Buddha, he transformed his polity from one of military conquest to one of Dharmavijaya - victory by righteousness. By providing royal patronage for the propagation of Buddhism both within and beyond his empire, he helped promote the transfiguration of Buddhism into a world religion that spread peacefully across the face of Asia.
Reformation
In his edicts, King Ashoka spoke of what might be called state morality, and private or individual morality. The first was what he based his administration upon and what he hoped would lead to a more just, more spiritually inclined society, while the second was what he recommended and encouraged individuals to practice. Both these types of morality were imbued with the Buddhist values of compassion, moderation, tolerance and respect for all life.
King Ashoka gave up the predatory foreign policy that had characterized the Mauryan Empire up till then and replaced it with a policy of peaceful co-existence. The judicial system was reformed in order to make it fairer, less harsh and less open to abuse, while those sentenced to death were given a stay of execution to prepare appeals and regular amnesties were given to prisoners.
State resources were used for useful public works like the importation and cultivation of medical herbs, the building of rest houses, the digging of wells at regular intervals along main roads and the planting of fruit and shade trees. To ensure that these reforms and projects were carried out, King Ashoka made himself more accessible to his subjects by going on frequent inspection tours and he expected his district officers to follow his example. To the same end, he gave orders that important state business or petitions were never to be kept from him no matter what he was doing at the time.
He believed that the State had a responsibility not just to protect and promote the welfare of its people but also its wildlife. Hunting certain species of wild animals was banned, forest and wildlife reserves were established and cruelty to domestic and wild animals was prohibited. The protection of all religions, their promotion and the fostering of harmony between them, was also seen as one of the duties of the state. It even seems that something like a Department of Religious Affairs was established with officers called Dhamma Mahamatras whose job it was to look after the affairs of various religious bodies and to encourage the practice of religion.
Law Maker
The great conception of the ancient Indian civilization was the King could not be and was not a law-maker. The king of the land was to act according to the laws prescribed by the ancient sages and he could not override them. His authority amounted to proclamations explaining existing laws or reviving those which had fallen into disuse. It is in this context that we should view King Ashokas Rock and Pillar edicts which are important from a political, economic and religious point.
The enactments issued by Ashoka were not randomly placed. Each one was set up to portray a particular message. One edict - the Bhabru Rock Edict, which was placed near in Jaipur state, is a very interesting one. Here, King Ashoka expressed his faith in the Buddha, Dharma and the Sangha and also refers seven examples of Buddhism which were dear to him and he wished that his subjects should also follow them.
The second passage of the Edict, the Traditions of the Noble Ones, emphasizes the idea of time, a recurring theme throughout Ashokas selections. It relies on the past to show how venerable, time-tested, and pure the traditions of the Dhamma are. In the four discussions on Future Dangers, he presents a warning -- it is imperative to practice the Dhamma as soon as one encounters it. By no means should the practice be put off because there is no guarantee that opportunities for practice will exist in the future.
These dangers are broken down into two categories. The first set of dangers includes death, aging, illness, famine, and social turmoil in ones own life. The second category of dangers centres on the religion of Buddhism itself - Buddhism will degenerate as a result of improper exercise by its practitioners. The point of these passages is to give a sense of urgency to the practice of Buddhism, so that an effort will be made to take advantage of the teachings while one can.
The next passage presents the ideal of inner safety, an ideal already embodied in the lives of those who have practiced the religion in full. It stresses that true happiness comes not from relationships, but from the peace gained in living a solitary life, existing off alms and free to meditate in the wilderness.
The fifth passage analyses the ideal presented into three qualities; body, speech, and mind. While the passage best expresses the goal of training ones actions in body, speech and mind, the sixth passage contains what is considered to be the most succinct expression of the Four Noble Truths; suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path to its cessation. The last passage shows how these goals may be realized by focusing on two main qualities -- truthfulness and constant reflection.
Ideals
What a masterpiece! The inscriptions in the edict underlie every aspect of Buddhist practice. King Ashoka wanted to inspire his subjects. He wanted to tell his subjects that practice in Dhamma builds upon the qualities in everyone -- the lay follower and the monk; men, women and children. The message also emphasizes again the theme of time, or more appropriately, the timelessness of the Dhamma. Whoever in the past, future or present develops purity in thought, word or deed, will have to do it in this way, and this way only.

Lanka before Devanampiyatissa
The Sri Lanka Pali chronicles, Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa, mention that Buddha visited Sri Lanka (Sinhala Dweepa) thrice in his lifetime and had preached his Dhamma to the people of this country. If we accept this legend then people of Lanka were aware of Buddhas teachings since then.
The thirteenth century Pujawaliya states that merchants Tapassu and Bhalluka built a stupa in Lanka enshrining the hair-relics of the Buddha, also mentioned in Nidanakatha, as the two merchants who offered food to the Buddha immediately after his enlightenment. They are counted as the first among the Buddhas lay disciples. Senerath Paranavitana describes the seventh century Tiriyay rock-inscription, about the Girihanduseya founded by guild of merchants named Trapussaka and Vallika..
If Tapassu (Trapusa/Tapusa) and Bhalluka (Ballika/Vallika)were historical characters, and if they had built the Girihanduseya then they should be considered as having introduced Buddha Dhamma to Lanka, but as there may not have been a powerful political leader in the country to accept and promote Buddha Dhamma it may have been limited to the locality of the eastern sea port and trade centre.
Paranavithana also quotes from Mahavagga and Nidanakatha that the two merchants came from Ukkala (in Odisha) and the stupa was built in their own country. Hieun Tsang, on his journey from Balkh to Bamian in Gandhara noticed the remains of two stupas built over these Hair relics. The Burmese Buddhists firmly believe that the two merchants enshrined these precious relics in their own Shwe Dagon at Rangoon.
There is a strong possibility that Tapassu and Bhalluka could have been historical characters during the time, or after the parnirvana of the Buddha because of the legends associated with them in Burma and China. We have literary evidence from the Anguttara Nikaya, Ekanipata, Cattavagga Bhikkhus out of my lay disciples the first to take the three refuges are Tapassu and Bhalluka, the tradesmen. In Aguttara Nikaya we also have a Tapussa sutra, but we do not know if Buddha is speaking about the same merchant Tapussa. In China we find Ti-wei Po-li ching, the sutra of Trapusa and Bhallika, though we do not find any teachings, or sermons of the two merchants.
When it comes to archaeological evidence, there are the recent discoveries in Odisha by G. N. Mohanti and others. In Tarapur, 65 kilometers from Bhubaneswar, two early Brahmi inscriptions were found, one of them read Bhekku Tapussa danam, on the Deulipal hill, a rock cut cave another early Brahmi inscription Bhallika lena near the gigantic square shaped stupa on Dauli hills, probably the Kesa Tupa.
The traders who passed through Lanka, or who may have settled down in the island, may have mentioned about Buddha and his teaching, in the same manner others may have mentioned Mahavira or Makkali Gosala. Some of the traders would have married Lankan women and settled down in Lanka, and their children would have probably followed the father's religious traditions. That is how a Muslim community grew in Lanka, with Muslim traders marrying and settling down in this country. In Sri Lanka even today, there are Sinhala families who carry Muslim names as their family names, and Muslims who carry Sinhala surnames.
When Panduvasadeva, nephew of Vijaya, arrived in Lanka with his group, dressed as Paribrajakas, people received them with due respect. His would be consort, Baddhakaccana, too arrived with her entourage dressed as Pabbajitakara, (Geiger calls them nuns) it could mean people in Lanka were also familiar with female mendicants of whatever faith.
Pandukabaya had worshiped yakkha Kalawela and Cittaraja and yakkhini Cetiya, making sacrificial offering to them. The next chapter mentions a Brahmana purohita (and Geiger calls him a chaplain). In chapter 33, we come across an arama of Nigantha, where a Nigantha named Giri resided. This is mentioned as Tiththarama, built by Pandukhabaya, (437  367 BCE) and had been constantly inhabited under twenty-one kings. Vattagamini Abhaya, (89  77 BCE) after defeating the Damila, destroyed the arama of the Nignthas and build the Abhayagiri vihara. This could be the first recorded case of religious conflict in Sri Lanka, still not by the people, but by the king.
The Pali chroniclers used the term Nigantha to describe the Jain shramana, even calling Mahavira as Niganthanathaputta. But the fact remains that Jain shramana had resided in an arama which would have been there from the time of Pandukhabaya, through the times of Devanampiya Tissa and DuttaGamini. There could have been other arama of the Jains and even Buddhist monks too would have resided in caves or arama. throughout this period. .
Prof. Raj Somadeva has also thrown a challenge, based on his many years of research on the southern face of our Sri Lankas central mountains, which he claims could be the 'Giri Dipa' mentioned in Sri Lankan chronicles. "Thus the initial movement of diffusing of Buddhism in Sri Lanka had occurred before the Mauryan missionary set forth and the Giri Dpa or the central mountainous tract of the country became the focus of establishing the cave monastic-cum-residential abodes of the Buddhist monks, while forming the archaic Buddhist religious landscape in Sri Lanka".
B. M. Barua has identified Giridipa as the central hilly region of Lanka. He identified other regions as, Lankadipa (Yakkhas, eastern and south-eastern coast), Nagadipa (Nagas, North Coast), and Tambapannidipa (western and south western coast).
The people in Sri Lanka would have been familiar with, and following the various Dhamma, be it Vedic, Ajivika, Jain or Buddha Dhamma. The kings too would have followed one such Dhamma or a confused practice taken from various beliefs, as we do today, to which later would have entered Christian, and Islamic practices and it is today more a Mahayana tradition in the name of Theravada, with many practices and rituals borrowed from Hindu and Christian faiths..
According to Taranatha, Buddha Dhamma had arrived in Lanka long before the time of Ashoka. Arrival of Buddhism in Lanka owes nothing to Ashoka and everything to an elder named Krishna, who comes to the island at the request of its king Asana-Simha-Kosa: He preached the doctrine for three months in that island, filled it with monasteries and sanghas and led many people to the four stages of perfection. According to Taranatha this Krishna was succeeded by Sudarshana, who died some years before Ashoka's reign, suggesting that the arrival of Buddhism in Lanka began during the time of Pandukabhaya and Chandragupta, a view shared by some modern historians.
We cannot say there were Buddhists in Sri Lanka from the 5th century BCE, because there really could not have been any Buddhists even in India then. Neither would there have been any Hindus or Jains then, because there would not have been any labels to segregate people into different religions. This concept would have arrived with the invasions by the Muslims and the Christians, for they already had their labels, as Jews, Christians and Muslim and they were fighting each other for the love of the same God. The terms Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism were coined by Europeans, beginning with Max Weber.
Even if they had become aware of Buddha Dhamma, 5th century BCE Lanka people would not have shown much interest in the philosophy, as they would not have seen any material benefits by following it. Since at the time it was only a Dhamma, which had not turned into a folk religion, we could not say that Buddhism was practiced in Lanka at the time, and even after the royal patronage, the people would have practiced their indigenous customs and rituals, or a mixture of Vedic, Indian and indigenous folk religious practices, as we do even today.
Unless our archaeologists take a serious interest to search for answers to what our ancient people believed in, we would never know if and when our people began to worship the Buddha and his symbols.
Even though we have also been so close to India, geographically, socially and economically, there would have been major differences too. There may not have been much development in agriculture or trade in Lanka, and thus less chances of urbanization, except around the sea ports and the urban centers like Anuradhapura and Tissamaharama. We did not have mineral resources, like they had in India, copper in and around Bihar, or Gold in Karnataka and Andra. We probably had only iron and gems in the hill country, and pearls in Mannar, which did not develop into a large scale trade or industry.
In India it was commercialization and urbanization which would have resulted in greed, envy, invariably leading to unhappiness and suffering among mankind. When there was little suffering, when the majority of the people were satisfied with what they had, there would not have been any urgency to seek salvation or relief from such suffering, thus no new philosophies or traditions would have developed in Lanka. The conditions would not have been conducive for the development of new philosophies or religious thoughts, or for a Mahavira, Gosala or a Buddha to appear in Lanka at the time. To page 16
However by about the mid first century BCE, Lanka would have been the ideal ground for the growth of Buddha Dhamma, as we were a non-violent culture. There would have been plenty of food, fruits and vegetables, thus our people would never have needed to eat the rotting flesh of dead animals. If they did not kill animals for food, they would never have offered animal sacrifices to their gods. If man did not show violence against animals, they would not have shown any violence against his own brother. Today man is the only animal who shows real, unreasonable violence against its own species. I have always believed that we should not refer to our pre-historic people as hunter-gatherers. Except for an occasional individual who hunted animals or fished, as we find even now in our villages, people would have been vegetarian. This is also based on the fact, that no hunting scenes have been found in any of our pre-historic cave paintings in Sri Lanka.
It would not have been necessary for Ashoka to promote his Dhamma in Lanka, as our people would have been really practicing a kind of Ashoka Dhamma already. In such a culture, people would have been automatically, unconsciously following the path of the Buddha. They would not have felt a need to recite the Five Precepts day in and day out, because they would not have violated them.
While Ashoka mentions all his ministers who were sent to West Asia and the Mediterranean, and even South India, he fails to mention Lanka. He also fails to mention Mahinda and Sanghamitta or the sending over of the Bo sapling. Unless of course we have still not discovered inscriptions where they are mentioned. If we accept that Tamraparni is Lanka, and not the river in Tamil Nadu, then Ashoka had sent his Dhamma Mahamatra to Lanka with his Ashoka Dhamma, before the time of Devanampiyatissa, probably during the time of Tissa's father, Mutasiva.
Instead of going on repeating what others before us had said, like the Brahmins at the time of the Buddha, let us explore Tiriyaya and also the Girihandyseya said to be in the deep south of Lanka, near Ambalantota. We have to dig up, and try to date the earliest artefacts we could find in such places. We need to search for more evidence of the arrival of Mahinda thera and Sangamitta theri, for at present we only have the Rajagal inscription, "ye ima dipa patamayaidiya agatananidika-[thera ma]hida teraha tube" translated by Paranavithana as "This is the stupa of the elder Idika and the elder Mahinda, who came to this island by the foremost good fortune." (1970: 35, Ins. No. 458).
According to the Dipavamsa, in Pataliputra at the time of Ashoka, there were 62 'false doctrines', and 96 creeds. Then many of them would have come to Lanka too. Ravana is a pious and devout follower of Jain Dhamma, in Vimala Suris Paumacharya. If this Ravana lived in Lanka, then Jaina Dhamma was established in Lanka even before the time of Ramayana.
However with all these various beliefs and traditions, still there would not have been any conflicts or inter-faith tensions in our country, which is a lesson for us today.
Our concern should not be about who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka or when it arrived, but to live by the teachings of the Buddha. Most important, we have to search for evidence, and try to understand how our people would have lived in a peaceful environment, with no conflicts resulting from race, creed, caste or language. The greatest homage we can pay to the Buddha and Arhat Mahinda himi is to follow the path shown by them.

Mihintale illuminated
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will switch on the Poson illuminations at Mihintale at 6 pm today at a ceremony at the Mihintale Medamaluwa to mark the second day of the Lake House Mihintale Aloka Pooja held for the 56th time this year.
Starting from 1962, the Mihintale Aloka Pooja is organized annually by the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (Lake House) to mark the Poson Poya Day, a day of great historical and religious significance to Buddhists in Sri Lanka.
On Poson Full Moon Poya day, Buddhists around the country celebrate the Mahindaagamanaya, the arrival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka over 2,300 years ago. According to the chronicles, Arahat Mahinda, son of Emperor Asoka of India, delivered a historic sermon to King Devanampiyatissa on that day making him the first follower of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. Each year, mass religious observances and illuminations are being organized at Missaka Pavva, now commonly known as Mihintale, the place where this historic event took place.
Lake House sponsored Aloka Pooja is a highlight at Mihintale every year that adds glamour to the Poson festivities. Aloka Pooja commenced yesterday with the participation of a large crowd of devotees. Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe switched on the lights to illuminate the Mihintaleseya and the surroundings in the presence of other invitees and representatives of the Ceylon Electricity Board and Lake House.
The three-day event is held under the patronage of Mihintale Raja Maha Viharadhipathi and Trustee Ven. Walawahengunawawe Dhammaratana Nayaka Thera and the direction of Lake House Chairman and Managing Director Krishantha Cooray. This year Aloka Pooja is jointly sponsored by the CEB, Dialog and National Savings Bank. Anuradhapura District Secretary R. M. Wanninayake will switch on the lights tomorrow, the third and final day of Aloka Pooja in the presence of Lake House and other State officials. Winners of the Budusarana Oratorical Contest will be awarded prices and certificates on that day.
In addition to many religious activities, dansals, Poson pandols and lanterns will be a common sight during the Poson festival attracting large crowds to Anuradhapura and Mihintale. Parallel to the Aloka Pooja, Lake House jointly with the Public Trustee Department will offer sil redi to devotees who observe Sil at Mihintale Raja Maha Viharaya today.
Lake House in preparation for the Aloka Pooja offered a replica of the Buddhas sacred footprint in stone and a wooden statue of Arahat Mahinda Thera earlier this month to Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya. They were carried from Colombo to Mihintale sacred premises in a motorcade with a float. The motorcade left Colombo from the Lake House premises on June 6 and reached Mihintale on June 8. The Maha Sangha led by Chief Incumbent of the Mihintale Rajamaha Viharaya Ven.Walawahengunawewe Dhammarathana thera paid obeisance to the footprint.
The replica of Lord Buddhas sacred footprint in stone was created with contributions from Lake House employees, while the wooden image of Arahat Mahinda thera was created by a team led by Janaka Edirisinghe.
A multitude of people lined the roads to pay homage to the sacred objects, when they were being transported from Colombo to Mihintale. For Buddhists in Sri Lanka, Poson Poya is second only to Vesak in terms of importance, as it marks the advent of Buddhism which led to a historical turning point in many aspects of peoples lives.
It marked the emergence of a new and rich cultural heritage which we, the Sri Lankans, proudly speak of even today.
Even though Poson is celebrated with fervour all over the country, the main ceremonies are concentrated in Anuradhapura and Mihintale, which are known as the cradle of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. As in every year, a large number of people are expected in Anuradhapuara and Mihintale for Poson religious observances this year too.

## Title: The Mihintale mission

The Mihintale mission
During his brief stay in the island, Arahant Mahinda made use of five works of the Pali Canons: Cullahatthipadopama Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya I, 3. 7), Peta Vatthu and Vimana Vatthu, two books of Khuddaka Nikaya (short volume) on celestial and ghostly mansions, Devaduta Sutta (on Heavenly Messengers - Majjhima Nikaya III 3. 10) and Balapandita Sutta (on Wise and Fool - Majjhima Nikaya III, 3. 9.).
The whole royal family of King Devanampiyatissa is said to have become Buddhists following these sermons; some family members, in fact, attained the first stage of sainthood, Sotapanna.
Sotapanna is the stream-winner, which literally means entering the stream. He eradicates the first three fetters: belief in an individual self (sakkaya dihi), douabt or uncertainty, especially about the teachings (vicikiccha) and attachment to rites and rituals (silabbata paramaso). The rest goes as sensual desire (kamacchando), ill-will (vyapada), lust for material existence and rebirth, (ruparago), lust for immaterial existence and rebirth in a formless realm (aruparago), conceit (mano), restlessness (uddhacca) and ignorance (avijja). The sotapanna is named after a simile that compares attaining Nibbana with crossing a stream and reaching the farthest shore. Sotapanna, hence, is the first followed by three stages: sakurdagami (once-returner), anagami (non-returner) and arahant (totally awakened).
One sublime reason for the solid establishment of Buddhism in Sri Lanka is Arahant Mahindas skilful choice of works from the Pali Canons. There is more to his Mihintale mission than just converting another royal clan into Buddhism.
This fact is clearly corroborated, as the arahant did not get to the conversion business right away; his first requirement was inquiring intellectual capacity of the chief of state with the historys first recorded famous Intelligence Quotient on trees and relatives.
The simile of the elephant footprint
With this in the setting, Culla Hatthipadopama Sutta (Majjhima Nikaya: Sutta 27), a minor discourse on the simile of elephant footprints, is an interesting study. Linguistically, Hatthi, Pada and Opama mean elephant, foot and simile respectively in Pali.
The source is based on a conversation between two Brahmins (non-Buddhists): Pilotika and Janussoni. Pilotika, though not a perfect Buddhist convert, describes his pleasant feelings about Buddhist philosophy and its followers to Janussoni, making the latter get fascinated in a follow-up.
An inquiring-minded Janussoni raises the issue of Buddhas claim to be an Enlightened Being. Simply put, the learned Brahmin questions Buddhas feat of wisdom, to which Pilotika brings out a simile of an elephant.
 Suppose a wise elephant woodsman were to enter an elephant wood and were to see in the elephant wood a big elephants footprint, long in extent and broad across. He would come to the conclusion: Indeed, this is a big bull elephant. So too, when I saw four footprints of the recluse Gotham, I came to the conclusion: The Blessed One is fully enlightened, the Dhamma is well proclaimed by the Blessed One, the Sangha is practising the good way.
(Translation by Venerable Nanamoli and Bodhi Theras)
The Buddhas footprints, Pilotika notices, involve the non-Buddhist scholars thinking about raising a particular set of questions and getting armed with rebuttals for obvious answers. Pilotika joyously explains how he sees the same scholars becoming the Buddhas disciples. Pilotikas argument is that he has the capacity to measure Buddhas accomplishment of wisdom by seeing his disciples.
Janussoni could be made satisfied by Pilotikas explanations, but it reflects the modern-day misunderstanding of Buddhism.
Buddhism is generally understood as the fact that the true Buddhist stays away from basic sins such as slaughter, stealth, uncelibacy, false speech and alcohol consumption. The core of the teachings, however, is far deeper.
Comparing religions
Arahant Mahindas choice shows the clear difference he wanted to point out between a normal saint and a Buddhist saint. The best way to see the truth is walking from darkness up into the light. Janussoni was enlightened when he heard the Buddhas expanded version of elephant footprint simile. Just because the footprint was large in length and breadth, it does not help picture the big elephant. There can be dwarf female elephants with feet large in length and breadth.
Likewise, there can be other non-Buddhist saints who stay away from the sins; most sins are listed in the sutta. A big elephant if fathomed only by seeing the whole being.
So the real Buddhist saint should be understood, or the real accomplishment of wisdom should be understood, by the realisation and the practice of four noble truths, originally taught in Buddhism. The sutta is hard to understand in one go. However, if studied carefully, the sutta helps us develop the idea that the modern-day concept of comparing Buddhism with other religions is not theoretically correct. Every religion has its unique features, and so has Buddhism: four noble truths, for one.
Although the message seems simple and clear, it is hard to convince it to a run-of-the-mill. It is this background that led, or forced, Arahant Mahinda to inquire the intellectual capacity of King Devanampiyatissa to get the message.
Many scholars, especially Westerners, entertain the theory that Buddhism encourages only the saintly life. Arahant Mahinda gives the lie to this famous misconception with his subsequent sermons of Peta Vatthu, Vimana Vatthu, Devaduta Sutta and Balapandita Sutta, which mostly discuss the way a Buddhist should behave as a layperson. For instance, Peta Vatthu illustrates the fate of evil-doers and Vimana Vatthu focuses on what the virtuous can look forward to.
Heavenly messengers
Devaduta Sutta talks of five heavenly messengers we see in our life, but continuously and unknowingly pass over.
The five heavenlymessengers
1. A toddler standing and lying with difficulty.
2. An old woman or man decayed and bent like the framework of a roof.
3. A sick woman or man, immersed in their own urine and excreta, raised by others and conducted by others.
4. An offender taken hold by the king and given various kinds of torture caned and whipped.
5. A dead woman or man after one day, two days or three days, bloated and turned blue.
Balapandita Sutta teaches how the human beings suffer through their follies, thus encouraging good deeds.
The primary reason for arahant Mahindas arrival in Lanka is the third council which took place during Emperor Asokas regime under the guidance of Ven Moggaliputtatissa. It was a hard task for the emperor to set the background for the third council, but reached the expected fruition. Arahant Mahindas emissary role is a result of the third council of Buddhism held during Emperor Asokas period.
Third Council
The council, in fact, remains significant and weighty since it paved way for the establishment of the teachings in nine different countries; hence Arahant Mahinda set foot in Lanka, one of the countries then known as Thambapanni, to establish Buddhism.
The background for the third council was created 218 years after the Buddhas demise, in Emperor Asokas regime. Despite his notoriety for military offensives, Asoka turned into a different personality following the encounter with a novice monk. The emperor soon grew interested in the teachings.
He channelled a lot of state funds to the welfare of Buddhism, earning the wrath of powerless brahmins. Brahmins obviously had issues with the upbringing of Buddhism, and they had been scheming for the downfall of Buddhism.
One strategy was entering the monk order and living as they desire. This was infiltration, one can say. This strategy proved effective as people became embarrassed and disappointed over the behaviour of some monks. They did not care to assume it was a brahmin strategy to put Buddhism into shame.
By this time, it dawned upon the emperor that the Uposatha ceremony, or prescribed purification of monks, had not been performed for seven years. He was interested in continuing the much acclaimed spiritual practice. A monk must confess any discipline breach to another monk according to the prescribed purification procedure. The emperor sent courtiers to let the monk order be informed about his wish.
However, a positive response from the genuine monks was hard to obtain. They objected as the order was impure with heretic monks. Courtiers could not see the spiritual grounds of the objection, and they mistook the objection as acting against the royal decree. Offended courtiers started massacring the monks, but were brought to halt by emperors brother who was also a monk.
Asoka was disturbed to learn this and inquired Ven Moggaliputtatissa if he was responsible for what his courtiers had done. Ven Moggaliputtatissa smartly handled the situation enlightening the emperor further on Buddhism; the monks main point was that Buddhism is a philosophy that sorts things out by analysing.
Asoka then assigned himself the time-consuming task of interviewing each and every monk to identify their genuine position. A monk failing to provide a satisfactory explanation would be disrobed with a proper laypersons job as an alternative.
At least 60,000 people are said to have been disrobed in the purging process. The path for the third council was thus cleared in the 17th year of Emperor Asokas period.
Later additions
As Pali sources maintain, Ven Moggaliputtatissa Thera compiled a book titled Katavatthupakarana of 23 chapters as a rebuttal to heretical views held by different sects. The council had been executed for nine months with Ven Moggaliputtatissa Thera as the chair of the assembly of 1,000 arahants.
Many historians, however, question the third council. Lankan chronicles and Samantapasadika glossary do mention about the third council, but many other sources do not have references to such an event during the period. Ironically Asokas inscriptions do not refer to the event either!
Asokas claim of having united the monk order and disrobed the heretics remains scribed in his inscriptions.
It is clear, as mentioned earlier, Asokas two precautions were followed by the major event of the third council. When it comes to the shouldering of the event, it is Ven Moggaliputtatissa who deserves the honour, though the emperor must have provided financial and other material sponsorship.
The absence of the mention may well be accredited to the emperors respect towards Ven Moggaliputtatissa for shouldering the event.
Following this major event, the emperor worked on extending his foreign relations by spreading Dhamma in the neighbouring countries. He was lucky to be equipped with enough human resources to accomplish his mission. Asokas mission of sending Buddhist representatives to nine countries is a breakthrough event second only to Ven Moggaliputtatissas compilation of Katavatthupakarana and steering the third council.

Healing the body with
Mindfulness of breathing
Excerpt from a Dharma talk entitled Mindfulness of Breathing given by Thich Nhat Hanh in Plum Village, France.
The first exercise of mindful breathing
We should always start with our physical bodies, because our physical bodies also needs peace, harmony and rest. In order for our mind to be concentrated, and also for our minds to be in peace and harmony, walking meditation, sitting meditation, and deep relaxation are exercises that concern our physical bodies.
We should realize a true rest. We have lost our capacity to really rest our bodies. That is why we all need vacations to rest, but to rest is an art. Many among us know how to rest, but some others dont know how to rest. Our bodies need rest in order to heal. There are wounds in our bodies, as in our minds, and rest is necessary. The practice of mindful breathing allows us to realize this rest.
Animals in the forest, every time they are wounded, know how to rest. They look for a very quiet place, and they just stay there, without moving, for many days. They know its the best way for their bodies to heal. During this time they dont even think to eat or to run after prey. This wisdom is still alive in animals, but we human beings have lost the capacity to rest. We know we need vacations, we need rest, but we dont know how to use the time that is given to us. Sometimes, after a vacation, we are more tired than if we didnt have the vacation. So we have to learn how to rest.
Deep relaxation here is one of the methods of resting. Walking meditation is also a method. Sitting meditation is another means to rest. In order to rest, you have to know how to use your breathing. The first exercise the first exercise that the Buddha proposed is While I am breathing in, I am aware that this is breathing in; and I breathe out, and I am aware that I am breathing out. Recognizing breathing in as breathing in, and breathing out as breathing out.
The Second Exercise of Mindful Breathing
The second exercise: I breathe in, and I am aware of the length of my in-breath; breathing out, I am aware of the length of my out-breath. During the second exercise, we are aware of the length of the in-breath and the out-breath. That means that we are aware only of breathing in and breathing out. If your in-breath is long like thisyou are aware of the in-breath all during the length of the in-breath. That doesnt mean that a long in-breath is better than a short in-breath. What is important here is mindfulness. It is not the length of breathing in or breathing out. If the in-breath is long, you know it. If the out-breath is long, you know it, that is all.
Do not try to prolong the breath; just allow it to be the way it is, naturally. If its short, let it be short. You only need to light the light of mindfulness to recognize what is gong on at that moment. In this case it is a long in-breath, in that case it is an in-breath of another length. Light up the light of mindfulness, in order to recognize that this is an in-breath and it is quite a long in-breath. During practice you touch deeply your in-breath and your out-breath, and you stop thoughts. We should not interfere with the length of the breath, only being aware of what is going on.
So, during the first exercise, breathing in, breathing out; during the second, long and short. During the second exercise we are aware of the length of the in-breath or the out-breath.
The Third Exercise of Mindful Breathing
With the third, I breathe in and I am aware of my whole body. That means while you breathe like this, you generate energy of mindfulness, and with the energy of mindfulness you embrace your whole body.
You recognize your whole body being present here, either sitting, lying down, standing, or walking. Breathing is to generate the object of mindfulness. The object of mindfulness here is the whole body. You know that in the first exercise the object of mindfulness is in-breath, out-breath. In the second exercise, the object is length of the breath; in the third, it is to embrace, to contact, to touch something that is more than the breath, the physical body.
The physical body is the foundation of the breath. So you start with pure breathing, and you arrive at your physical body. Breathing in, I am aware of my whole physical body; breathing out, I am aware of my whole physical body. That way, we start to recognize our whole physical body, we embrace it, and we are at peace with it. Breathing in, I am aware of my whole body. This seems to be very simple, but it is extremely important. We started to come back to the breath, and after becoming one with our in-breath, now we are becoming one with our physical body. This is returning, coming back. We wandered a lot in the past, but now we are determined to come back to ourselves. The first destination is the breath, and then it is the body, and later the feelings, the perceptions, and consciousness, knowledge.
Take another step in order to come back to yourself as a physical body: Breathing in, I am aware of my whole physical body. This is already a love meditation. We have to be very interested in our physical body. I recognize you, my physical body. I have abandoned you too much, but now Im coming back, and I recognize you as existing.
The Fourth Exercise of Mindful Breathing
Number four: Breathing in, I calm the activities of my physical body. Because there has not been enough peace in your physical body, not enough harmony, there are wars in your physical body, sorrow, or pain; so you should be here for your physical body. My physical body, I am here for you. Take care, be interested in your physical body, and start to take care of your physical body. I breathe in, and I calm my physical body.
When in a lying position, practicing deep relaxation, you can realize rest and recovering of your physical body. You have room in your home where you can practice deep relaxation every day. You can practice this as a family. One member of the family can guide the practice of deep relaxation. Here in Plum Village the brothers and the sisters can show you how to practice deep and complete relaxation. You have to learn that very carefully, in order to do it when you get back home. Also you can teach that to the children. We can practice this as a family, a family is a Sangha. One member of the family can guide the practice of relaxation. During fifteen or twenty minutes, we can re-establish our mindfulness, we can dissipate stress. It is very important to practice as a group, as a Sangha, as a family, and this will create a good habit among your children.
The third exercise is recognizing the presence of your physical body. The fourth exercise is to calm the activities of your physical body, being aware of your physical body as a whole, and then being aware of different parts of your physical body.
Bringing Mindful Breathing to Parts of Your Body
The next four exercises are about feelings, but today we will speak only about the first set of four exercises. In the Satipatthana Sutra, the Discourse on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness, the Buddha said, Like a farmer who goes into the attic and brings down a bag of grain, and opens it and lets all the seeds fall out onto the floor, and with his good eyes he can distinguish wheat from beans etc., when you generate mindfulness, with this mindfulness, you can identify different parts of your body.
I breathe in, I am aware of my eyes; I breathe out, and I smile to my eyes. This is because your eyes are part of your physical body, and you can start with your eyes. Then you go down to the nose, the mouth. You are aware of your brain, of your ears, and you should call the different parts of your physical body by their names, and send to each part of your body your smile.
Your smile, in mindfulness, is the energy of love. Your awareness is first, and love comes with it. You have to take care of your physical body, thats what the Buddha said. In the sitting position, or lying down, you can start generating mindfulness, and you send this energy to different parts of your body.  I breathe in and I am aware of my eyes; I breathe out, and I smile to my eyes. Recognize your eyes as existing, and send to your eyes the energy of your awareness. You can start with your eyes, and you can finish with your feet.
There are about thirty-six parts of the body that are discussed in this discourse of the Buddha. So always with mindfulness of breathing, you embrace the different parts of your body. When one part of your body is not well, when there is pain, when something is not going well in one part of your body, you should stop, you should tenderly embrace this part of your body with mindfulness. You should send energy and love, and this will help this part of your body to heal. The ideal position in which to do it is to lie down.
If your child needs this, you can become your childs guide in order to practice this. I will practice with you, my daughter; I will join my mindfulness energy with yours, in order for you to embrace this part of your body that is painful. I will smile to this part of your body. We can always practice as a Sangha, and we can do it every day, before going to bed, or after you wake up. You should always look for a moment to do it, even if you have a doctor who is treating you, even if you take medicines.
Resting and Letting the Body Heal Itself
You should know that only nature can really establish health in your body. The animals resting in the forest have a strong trust in nature. Its because our bodies have the capacity to heal. When we cut a finger, what should we do to heal Its enough to wash the wound, and let nature do the rest. Our mind knows how to heal itself, so we should allow our body to do the work. If healing is not happening, this is because we dont allow our body to heal, we have forbidden our body to heal, because we dont rest. Thats how we prevent our body healing.
It is very important to allow our body to heal itself. We should have trust in the capacity of our own body to heal. Practice the non-practice. Dont do anythingjust allow your body to rest. With mindfulness and this rest, you can transform the state of your physical body. The Buddha has spoken at length about this practice. You should really love your body. You should really take care of your body. Mindful breathing, with rest, can do miracles. While taking medicine, you can still help the healing with the practice of mindfulness of breathing and rest.

NCPA to implement new guidelines for day care centres
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) says it is dismayed by a video circulating online which shows a sick and medicated child locked out of a day care centre in Colombo, adding that the authority would issue and implement guidelines for day care centre operators.
The day care centres lack the knowledge to look after children properly, said NCPA ChairmanH.M. Abeyrathna.
He told the Daily News that the NCPA was unable to investigate the incident since parents of the child had complained directly to the police. However, if the parents were to approach the NCPA on matters related to day care centres, the authority would follow up on it.
He added that the NCPA will hold discussions with parents and day care centre operators to improve existing guidelines and implement new measures that would avoid further mistreatment of children at day care facilities. The video of the crying child, which went viral, shows the child crying to be let into the centre. The parents had voiced their concerns saying that the child had been sick and under medication.

Postal strike suspended
The Joint Postal Trade Unions Front (JPTUF) yesterday announced that it would together with 24 of its unions, suspend the postal strike which has lasted for the past 16 days.
JPTUF Convener Chinthaka Bandara addressing a media briefing held at the Ministry of Posts, Postal Services and Muslim Religious Affairs, said that as of 12 midnight yesterday they would suspend the strike until July 7.
We would however continue with other actions such as the Satyagraha before the Central Mail Exchange and would work to rule until July 7, he said.
The unions have been holding discussions with the National Salaries and Cadre Commission and the Ministry over the past couple of days.
By July 7, the work of the National Salaries and Cadre Commission with regard to their demands are expected to end and thereafter a permanent solution has been promised, After a permanent solution is announced, we will withdraw from all trade union action, Bandara added.
Among the demands agreed to are; the abolishment of the Class 3in the officer grade, re-establishment of the 18 positions under the Junior Grade, inclusion of Deputy Post Masters into the Consolidated Postal Service, making 1000 officers recruited under probation in the last 5 years permanent within the next month or two and the restructuring of the entire Consolidated Postal Service with new recruitment guidelines.
Bandara explained that the unions have been invited to a full day discussion with the Commission on June 30 to resolve the remaining issues.
We still have problems with the starting salary, though we got the 18 positions of the Junior Grade officers back we still do not know their salaries or promotion procedure and we need to discuss to which grade the deputy post masters would fit in; their salary scale and promotion procedure, Bandara said. The Lanka Postal Services Union and Sri Lanka Postal and Telecommunication Services Union which function outside of the JPTUF however have not made their stance known but Bandara said the latter would also be calling off the strike.
The issues were created by the 6/2006 Circular issued by the previous regime which sought to reduce the number of grades in the Public service, causing a ripple effect across all sectors.

Private sector should be more competitive - PM
The private sector should have confidence to access and compete with the bigger markets,in the neighbouring countries, and the world market as a whole.It should be able to compete with foreign investors coming to Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.

Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that there are greater opportunities in the global market and the private sector has to become more competitive to succeed in these markets.Premier Wickremesinghe further said that after 1977, foreign investments have been flowing into Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minister added that Sri Lankan businessmen should also be competitive and become the leaders in their respective fields.The country needs foreign investment, technology etc. But like in the apparel and hospitality industries the Sri Lankan private sector has to be competitive to compete with foreigners coming to Sri Lanka.
The Prime Minisyter also said that the Sri Lankan private sector can access the European market with the GSP Plus facility.
He also said Sri Lanka is located in a strategic location in the South Asian region which has a growing population and Per Capita Income in the coming few decades. Enterprise Sri Lanka is a stage for growth.
No one wants the Sri Lankan Private Enterprises to fail, the Premier said. As politicians, we too do not need those institutions to close and people to loose the jobs.

Sandya Ekneligoda appeals to President, PM about death threats
My husband was not involved with the LTTE, there are many CID investigations that could prove it, said Sandya Ekneligoda who is receiving threats Online, due to her seeking justice to her disappeared husband Prageeth Ekneligoda, in a press conference yesterday, requesting the public to understand her plight and stop attacking her and her children.
She requested the President to ensure the safety of her and her children, as the person behind the threats and defamation was his own advisor Ven. Ulapane Sumangala Thera. She also asked the Prime Minister to remember the statement he had made in support of her when in 2016, Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera verbally assaulted her at the Homagama Magistrates Court and to continue with that support. She requested the Maha Sangha to think of her as another Patachara, and sympathize with her and her children, without protesting against her.
Ekneligoda had been receiving threats on the social media for years, but since the conviction of Ven Gnanasara Thera, the number of threats had escalated, where people have even threatened to kill her and her children.
Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara thera verbally abused and threatened Sandya Ekneligoda at the Homagama Courts after the hearing of the enforced disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and the arrest of the Military Intelligence officers, in relation to his disappearance in January 2016. He was found guilty for abuse and the use of criminal force on May 24 and was sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment on June 14 and later released on bail.
She said the court case on her husbands disappearance was still pending, as the Sri Lanka Army is refusing to release information requested by Court, in the name of National Security.
Meanwhile, Amnesty International urged Sri Lankan authorities to urgently take action against those threatening human rights defender Sandya Ekneligoda. In a press release, the Organization said that over the recent days, Sandya Ekneligoda, a distinguished campaigner against enforced disappearances and the wife of disappeared Cartoonist Prageeth Ekneligoda, has been subject to a barrage of hate, abuse, intimidation, harassment and death threats on social media.

Spiritual Solace
Home to a large number of meditating monks, Veherayaya Purana Rajamaha Viharaya is perched in peaceful and quiet Galawewa about 5 km to 17 Junction on Colombo-Vavuniya Road. The meditating monks are attracted to the place because of its isolation and seclusion.
Veherayaya Rajamaha Viharaya is surrounded by paddy-fields and sesame fields. The narrow path between the fields immediately transports us into a world of its own. This is indeed a timeless retreat, engulfed by the essence of tranquillity and inner peace.
As we enter the sacred premises, we are instantly enclosed by a certain spiritual composure. The birdsong intermingles with the rustling of leaves in the trees and the movements of the monks engaged in their evening chores. All this culminated we are drawn into the profound peacefulness of the Veherayaya temple.
The golden standing Buddha statue, pure white stupa and the sacred Bo Tree enhance the placidity of the surrounding.
According to Veherayaya Purana Rajamaha Viharaya Chief Incumbent Venerable Palugama Nimalananda Thera, the site is blessed with a vibrant history dating back to the times of King Agbo I. He ruled the kingdom of Anuradhapura between 575 and 608 AC. An ancient pond and the stone pillars are the main evidence to prove that. It was completely destroyed before it was fully restored 30 years ago.
Plans are afoot to establish a Buddhist meditation-centre and a convalescent centre for providing accommodation and treatment for members of the Maha Sangha - the aged and the desolate, in particular.
The practice of Buddhist meditation such as Samatha and Vipassana to a great extent will help cultivate a developed mind. A peaceful mind is a key to happiness. It helps lead a peaceful life. Finally, the people with the peaceful mind will make a peaceful society, Venerable Nimalananda Thera maintains.
The Venerable Thera is trying his level best to keep the temple environs alcohol-free. The five precepts which encourage abstaining from taking life, taking what is not given, engaging in sexual misconduct, false speech and intoxicants are the moral pillars of any Buddhist. The practice of the Buddhist moral precepts has a profound impact on ones personal and social life.
Observing the five precepts help promote peaceful coexistence, mutual trust and understanding as well as the general peace and reconciliation in society. It will also help achieve social progress and development, the Venerable Thera says.
He does not claim any ownership of the temple. Yet, he wants to develop the temple and convert it into a resourceful place that nourishes the Buddha Sasana.
According to the Buddhas teaching, the Buddhist monks should be detached from everything worldly, the Venerable Thera adds, and that includes the very temples we dwell in.

Spiritual teachers made, not born
Venerable Bhikkhuni Bodhicitta is a Sri Lankan Buddhist nun based in Melbourne. She was an Anagarika in 2006 for almost a year under the Ajahn Chahs Forest tradition before she ordained as a Samaneri in 2007.
In 2010, the Venerable Bhikkhuni received her Upasampada in Sri Lanka under the tutelage of Venerable Dr M Punnaji Maha Thera, Venerable Professor Bhikkhuni Kusuma and several Senior Sangha members.
Her path of secular higher studies in medicine saw her graduate in bio medicine. Her career as a medical scientist in Australia met a surprising turn of events when the Dhamma set her view of life in a different paradigm.

Sri Lanka Army, HRCSL to work together
The Sri Lanka Army while assuring its best cooperation to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka yesterday, said bilateral understanding and coordination would certainly enable both parties to sort out those pending issues amicably as early as possible.
The Army in a media communiqu issued by the Army Directorate of Media, said the SLA is much more contended to have been screened by HRCSL at a time when the country is expanding its participation in UN assignments.
Sri Lanka Army, much more contented to have been screened by our own independent authority, i.e HRCSL, particularly at a time Sri Lanka is expanding its participation in UN assignments, accordingly, began submission of details of Army personnel, selected for UN missions for HRCSLs independent vetting. In the meantime, UNDPKO in constant touch with the Sri Lanka Army, has been inquiring into reasons, attributable to delayed dispatches of Sri Lankan troops for scheduled rotational releases as agreed upon, the statement said.
Full statement:
Bilateral Cooperation with HRCSL would Resolve Pending Screening Issues of UN Peace Keepers Sri Lanka as one of the Troop Contributing Countries (TCC) to the United Nations (UN) since the year 2004, has been in the practice of sending her troops for UN Peace Keeping assignments in large groups in close collaboration with the UN Department of Peace Keeping Operations (UNDPKO).
To be in line with the UN Secretary Generals decision No. 2012/18 on 11 December, 2012 in relation to screening of UN personnel for Human Rights, the Sri Lanka Army, consequent to discussions with the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, UNDPKO and the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL), resolved that an own national mechanism be followed with respect to independent screening of personnel through the HRCSL.
Accordingly, this national process of screening which needs the fullest cooperation of both the HRCSL and the Armed Forces for vetting its UN bound own members, came into effect early this year, although previous such clearance procedures were executed by authorities in the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
The Sri Lanka Army, is much more contented to have been screened by our own independent authority, i.e HRCSL, particularly at a time when Sri Lanka is expanding its participation in UN assignments, accordingly began submission of details of Army personnel selected for UN missions for HRCSLs independent vetting. In the meantime, UNDPKO in constant touch with the Sri Lanka Army, has been inquiring into reasons attributable to delayed dispatches of Sri Lankan troops for scheduled rotational releases as agreed upon.
A round table conference to this effect was attended by the Secretary to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chairperson and Commissioners of the HRCSL, visiting UNDPKO officials of the UN, New York, Commanders of the Army, Navy and Air Force Chief of Staff, Director General of the Directorate of Army Overseas Operations, STF officers and Ministry of Defence officials took place as recent as on Thursday (21) in Colombo. The Sri Lanka Army would always cooperate with the HRCSL for clearance of this backlog since information that had been produced by the Army for screening in some cases, could also contain shortcomings, complications, discrepancies due to operational commitments, change of residential addresses, etc.
The Sri Lanka Army while assuring its best cooperation all the time to the HRCSL for the implementation of its mandate, expects this bilateral understanding and coordination would certainly enable both parties to sort out those pending issues amicably as early as possible.
At present, Sri Lankan troops, the majority being from the Sri Lanka Army, have been deployed in Lebanon (UNIFIL), South Sudan (UNMISS), Mali (MINUSMA), Abyei (UNISFA), New York (UNHQ), Central African Republic (MINUSCA) and Western Sahara (MINURSO), either as Military observers, Liaison officers, Staff officers, Staff officer assistants or General Contingent troops for peace keeping. To-date a total of 450 Sri Lankan peace keepers are serving 7 UN peace keeping overseas missions under the UNDPKO.

## Title: Traditions of the pre-Mihintale era

Traditions of the pre-Mihintale era
It is evident from the chronicles relating the early history of Sri Lanka that before the introduction of Buddhism in the reign of King Devanampiya Tissa (250-210 BCE) there was no single religion which was widely accepted as the national religion of the country. Nevertheless, there was a wide range of religious beliefs and practices, different from one another, and each individual seems to have freely observed his religion according to his belief.
A noteworthy feature of the pre-Buddhist religion of Sri Lanka is that it was a mixture of the aboriginal cults and the beliefs of the aryan newcomers.
The worship of yaksas and yaksinis was a widely prevalent aboriginal custom of pre-Buddhist Lanka. King Pandukabhaya, the grandfather of Devanampiya Tissa, provided shrines for many of these spirits and also gave them sacrificial offerings annually. Some of these yaksas and yaksinis mentioned by name are Kalavela, Cittaraja, Vessavana, Valavamukhi and Citta. Vyadhadeva, Kammaradeva and Pacchimarajini, though not known as yaksas and yaksinis, also belong to the same category of aboriginal spirits. Trees like the banyan and palmyrah were also connected with the cults of these spirits showing that tree-worship was also prevalent.
Many scholars agree that these yaksas and other non-human beings are none but the spirits of the dead relatives and tribal chiefs who, the people believed, were capable of helping friends and harming enemies. This belief, as is widely known, formed one of the main features of the primitive religion and is extant even today.
Accounts relating the pre-Buddhist history of Sri Lanka also show a considerable influence of the religious trends of India on the society of Lanka. Several niganthas (Jainas) such as Giri, Jotiya and Kumbhanda lived in the reign of Pandukabhaya and hermitages were constructed for them and other ascetics like ajivakas, brahmans and the wandering mendicant monks. Five hundred families of heretical beliefs also lived near the city of Anuradhapura. The brahmans occupied a high place in society and their religious beliefs were also respected. The worship of Siva too may have been prevalent.
The account in the Mahavamsa of the settling of the adherents of various sects by King Pandukabhaya does not specifically mention the presence of any adherents of Buddhism among them. But the work refers to three visits of the Buddha to Sri Lanka, a statement which, though not corroborated by other evidence, has not been disproved. Legendary accounts also claim that two stupas  the Mahiyangana and the Girihandu  were constructed before the introduction of Buddhism. Among the newcomers too there could have been some members who were acquainted with Buddhism, especially as Bhaddakaccana, who arrived with 32 other maidens in the guise of nuns, was a close relative of the Buddha.
Humanistic teachings of Buddhism
Buddhism as a form of religious expression gained ascendency in India during this period. Emperor Asoka was crowned, according to the chronicles, in the year 218 of the Buddhist era (i.e., 268 BCE). Like his father Bindusara and grandfather Candragupta, Asoka was a follower of the brahmanical faith at the beginning of his reign. In the early years of his reign he followed an expansionist policy and in the eighth year of his coronation he conquered Kalinga, in the course of which 100,000 were slain and 150,000 taken prisoners. But the carnage of the Kalinga war caused him much grief and the king was attracted towards the humanistic teachings of Buddhism. According to the Sri Lanka chronicles, it was a young novice named Nigrodha who converted Asoka.
After the conversion of this great emperor Buddhism flourished under his patronage. He inculcated the teachings of the Buddha and set up edicts of morality at numerous places of his vast empire so that his subjects would adhere to them and his successors might follow him. He himself followed those morals and set an example to the others. The king is reputed to have built 84,000 stupas. The monks were lavishly provided with their requisites.
The king even permitted his son Mahinda and daughter Sanghamitta to join the Order when they were twenty and eighteen years of age respectively. These two illustrious disciples became noted for their piety, attainments, learning and profound knowledge of the Dhamma.
Vast numbers joined the Order in the reign of Asoka solely to share the benefits showered on it by the king, and such people were not only lax in their conduct, but also held doctrines counter to the teachings of the Buddha.
It was this dissenting element that led to the holding of the Third Buddhist Council under the patronage of King Asoka in order to purify the Buddhist religion (Sasana). It was at this Council held by a thousand theras (elders) under the leadership of Moggaliputta Tissa, at Pataliputta, that the Pali Canon of the Theravada, as it exists today, was finally redacted.
At this Council was also taken the important, decision of sending missionaries to different regions to preach Buddhism and establish the Sasana there. Thus the thera Moggaliputta Tissa deputed Majjhantika Thera to Kasmira-Gandhara, Mahadeva Thera to Mahisamandala, Rakkhita Thera to Vanavasi, Yona-Dhammarakkhita Thera to Aparantaka, Dhammarakkhita Thera to Maharattha, Maharakkhita Thera to Yonaloka, Majjhima Thera to Himavanta, theras Sona and Uttara to Suvannabhuumi, and Mahinda Thera with theras Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala to Lanka, saying unto the five theras: Establish ye in the delightful land of Lanka the delightful religion of the Vanquisher.
Mahinda was thirty-two-years-old when he undertook the mission to Sri Lanka. He had adopted the religious life at the age of twenty, mastered the doctrines and attained the highest spiritual life, i.e., arahantship. Pondering on the fitting time to come to Lanka, he perceived that Mutasiva, the ruler at that time, was in his old age, and hence it was advisable to tarry until his son became ruler.
Message from Asoka
In the meantime Mahinda visited his relatives at Dakkhinagiri and his mother at Vedisagiri along with his companions. His mother Devi, whom Asoka had married while he was yet a prince, was living at Vedisagiri at that time. Having stayed for six months at Dakkhinagiri and a month at Vedisagiri, Mahinda perceived that the right time had come, for the old ruler was dead and his son Devanampiya Tissa had become king.
Devanampiya Tissa was the second son of Mutasiva. He was a friend of Asoka even before he became king but the two had not seen each other. The first thing that Devanampiya Tissa did when he became king was to send envoys to Asoka, bearing costly presents. The envoys, when they returned, brought among other things the following message from Asoka:
Aham Buddha ca Dhamma ca Sangha ca saranamgato upasakattam vedesim Sakyaputtassa sasane tvamp'imani ratanani uttamani naruttama cittam pasadayitvana saddhaya saranam bhaja.
I have taken refuge in the Buddha, his Doctrine and his Order, I have declared myself a lay-disciple in the religion of the Sakya son; seek then, O best of men, refuge in these best of gems, converting your mind with believing heart.
This message of Asoka was conveyed to King Devanampiya Tissa in the month of Vesakha and it was the full-moon day of the following month Jettha (Sinhala Poson) that Mahinda fixed for his arrival in Sri Lanka. Among the companions of Mahinda were the theras Itthiya, Uttiya, Sambala and Bhaddasala, the samanera Sumana who was the son of Sanghamitta, and the lay-disciple Bhanduka who was the son of a daughter of Devi's sister and had become an anagami (once-returner) on hearing a sermon of Mahinda preached to Devi.

When a beloved disciple passes away
This beautiful sutta from the Pali canon tells the story of what happened after the beloved disciple and arahat Sariputta passed away. Sariputta was a truly remarkable student of the Buddha, and along with Ananda, was considered his greatest pupil. As Venerable Nyanaponika Thera writes of him in The Life of Shariputra:
Shariputra..was second only to the Buddha in the depth and range of his understanding, and his ability to teach the Doctrine of Deliverance.[Shariputra was a] skilled preceptor and exemplar, [a] kind and considerate friend [a] guardian of the welfare of the Bhikkhus under his charge[a] faithful repository of his Masters doctrine, the function which earned him the title of Dhamma-senapati, Marshal of the Dhamma[Shariputra was] always, himself, a man unique in his patience and steadfastness, modest and upright in thought, word and deed, a man to whom one act of kindness was a thing to be remembered with gratitude so long as life endured. Even among the Arahats, saints freed from all defilements of passion and delusion, he shone like the full moon in a starry sky.
What follows is the account of Sariputtas passing and how the Buddha turned his students attention from their sorrow to contemplation of the deepest inspiration of Sariputtas own lifeseeing through the impermanence of all fabricated things to the refuge and liberation of the Deathless.
Once the Blessed One was dwelling at Savatthi, in Anathapindikas park. At that time the Venerable Sariputta was at Nalaka village in the Magadha country, and was sick, suffering, gravely ill. The Novice Cunda was his attendant.
And the Venerable Sariputta passed away finally through that very illness. Then the Novice Cunda took the almsbowl and robes of the Venerable Sariputta and went to Savatthi, to the Jeta Grove, Anathapindikas park. There he betook himself to the Venerable Ananda and, having saluted him, seated himself at one side. Thus seated, he spoke to the Venerable Ananda saying: Venerable sir, the Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing away. These are his bowl and robes.
On this matter, Cunda, we ought to see the Blessed One. Let us go, friend Cunda, and meet the Master. Having met him, we shall acquaint the Blessed One with that fact.
Yes, Venerable sir, said the Novice Cunda.
They went to see the Blessed One, and having arrived there and saluted the Master, they seated themselves at one side. Then the Venerable Ananda addressed the Blessed One:
O Lord, the Novice Cunda has told me this: The Venerable Sariputta has had his final passing away. These are his bowl and robes. Then, O Lord, my own body became weak as a creeper; everything around became dim and things were no longer clear to me, when I heard about the final passing away of the Venerable Sariputta.
How is this, Ananda When Sariputta had his final passing away, did he take from you your portion of virtue, or your portion of concentration, or your portion of the knowledge and vision of deliverance
Not so, Lord. When the Venerable Sariputta had his final passing away he did not take my portion of virtue concentration wisdom deliverance, or my portion of the knowledge and vision of deliverance. But O Lord, the Venerable Sariputta has been to me a mentor, teacher, and instructor, one who rouses, inspires and gladdens, untiring in preaching Dhamma, a helper of his fellow monks. And we remember how vitalizing, enjoyable and helpful his Dhamma instruction was. Have I not taught you aforetime, Ananda, that it is the nature of all things near and dear to us that we must suffer separation from them, and be severed from them Of that which is born, come to being, put together, and so is subject to dissolution, how should it be said that it should not depart That, indeed, is not possible.
It is, Ananda, as though from a mighty hardwood tree a large branch should break off, so has Sariputta now had his final passing away from this great and sound community of bhikkhus. Indeed, Ananda, of that which is born, come to being, put together, and so is subject to dissolution, how should it be said that it should not depart This, indeed, is not possible.
Therefore, Ananda, be ye an island unto yourself, a refuge unto yourself, seeking no external refuge; with the Teaching as your island, the Teaching your refuge, seeking no other refuge.

## Title: Why develop metta for a bad person

Why develop metta for a bad person
There are some very bad people in the world. Sometimes evil seems to be not too strong a word for some of the actions that are perpetrated, and you may well wonder why should you develop metta towards those who commit evil actions.
Metta is a state of loving others. Its a state of empathetic awareness that brings about compassion, consideration, and kindness. If those evil people were to experience metta then they would not do the things that we so deplore. Acts of evil come from a failure of empathy.
It makes sense then that if you want the world to be a better place you would want all beings to experience metta  even the very bad ones. In fact especially the bad ones, since if evil people were to experience Metta, there would be no evil done. Im not suggesting that we can wish bad people into becoming good people, simply that its rational to wish that those who commit evil were free from the unwholesome mental states that lead to their actions. This implies that we should have compassion even for those who commit evil actions.
A meditation student of mine who is a psychotherapist pointed out to me that most of the actions that we would label as evil are committed by people who suffer from what is known as Antisocial Personality Disorder, and that scientific research studies have shown that up to 75% of all those in the US criminal justice system fit the diagnostic criteria for this personality disorder.
This disorder is almost certain to have a genetic component, so that many bad people are born that way and not made that way, although poor environments almost certainly make these genetically based traits worse. Many people, in committing evil, are therefore passing on the results of a sickness that they suffer from  a sickness that prevents them from feeling empathy, remorse, and anxiety.
Additionally, they may feel compelled to lie, even when its not necessary, have difficulty learning from past experience, and have trouble controlling their impulses in the way that most people can.
Evil as an illness
Theres no reason why we should feel any less sympathetic towards a criminal who, because of a genetic defect, has a lower than normal ability to control his or her impulses, than towards a person with any other genetically based physical or mental condition.
If we can feel sympathy for a person who suffers from, say, Downs Syndrome, then why not cultivate sympathy in meditation towards someone who has a genetic disorder like Antisocial Personality Disorder that ruins the lives not only of its direct sufferers but also those who are unfortunate enough to be exploited or harmed by them. As an aside, I hope (although I have no personal experience on which to build this hope) that those suffering from Antisocial Personality Disorder are able to learn to control their impulses. Some mental health professionals have shown that individual and group therapy can help those suffering from this devastating condition to learn to experience and to deal with their emotions, and to learn to have more moral concern for others.
I dont want to appear to be saying that those who act destructively should be absolved from all responsibility for their mental states and actions, simply that not everyone is starting from the same place in learning to take such responsibility, and that it is helpful to them and to us if we have sympathy for those in such an unfortunate position.
You might well ask though: how is you doing the metta bhavana towards a bad person going to have any effect on them Isnt it just a game that youre playing inside your own head
Its true that your meditation practice is not likely to have much effect on another person (although you never know  some interesting research has been done that shows that this does happen), but at the very least it will have an effect on you. It will help you to be more truly compassionate. It will reduce the amount of intolerance and hatred in the world by reducing the amount of intolerance and hatred in your own heart (which is the only place where you can guarantee to make a difference). - Wild Mind
