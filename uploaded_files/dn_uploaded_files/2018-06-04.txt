All Mahaweli settlers to get title deeds by year end
President Maithripala Sirisena said he will take necessary actions to provide land deeds to all the Mahaweli settlers by the end of this year.
He made these remarks at the Randiyawara presentation of 12,083 land deeds to Mahaweli settlers of Mahaweli B and C Rambakan Oya systems, at Aralaganwila Maguldamana Maha Vidyalaya last Friday (1).
The land titles were presented to farmers in terms of the Presidents vision to launch a national programme to present one million land deeds island-wide.
This programme is conducted under the special instructions given by President Maithripala Sirisena in 2016 to provide a solution to the long-standing problem faced by Mahaweli settlers. Under this programme, 100,000 land deeds have already been presented to the Mahaweli settlers. Another 40,000 deeds, grant titles, and lease certificates will be presented in 2018.
According to the Land Commissioner Generals Department, one million deeds and permits have been given to Mahaweli B, C and H systems in 2017, under this project. Under this programme, 12,573 government entities including schools, hospitals and police stations that have hitherto operated without a proper deed have also received land titles.
During the programme, deeds of ownership were granted to people in Mahaweli B (6,104) and C (4,312) and Rambakan Oya (1,595) systems. Further, 22 temples were granted land, while 50 government institutions also received titles, totaling 12,083 land deeds.
While addressing the gathering, the President mentioned that the Mahaweli development project was a mammoth multipurpose development project that covered many sectors including electricity and agriculture.
The President expressed his pleasure that the Moragahakanda reservoir could be constructed to complete the Mahaweli schemes large tanks. This project will help relieve the grievance of farmers and strengthen the economy of the country.
The President also expressed his confidence that the farming community will greatly benefit from the largest of its kind initiative since Independence to restore 2,400 agricultural tanks simultaneously, launched last year.
The project has suffered due to lack of numbers of sufficient engineers and technical officers. Special remedial measures are being taken right now, he said.
President Sirisena also mentioned that he has been receiving positive responses to requests he has made to the international community to develop the agricultural sector, adding further that, as in the past days of glory, we should trod a path of agro-based development.
President Sirisena spoke about the Gramashakthi Peoples Movement which is conducted island-wide with the assistance of the Presidential Secretariat in order to uplift the livelihoods of people suffering from poverty. He emphasised that among all poverty alleviation programmes, Gramashakthi is one of the most successful and that everyone should get together to contribute to its success without any political dispute.
He said that many progressive outcomes have been achieved during the last three and half years, though some of those can be intangible to some.
Despite criticisms or political instability that some media stations try to depict, a prosperous future is guaranteed to the people.
The President opened the two-storey building constructed under the Pibidemu Polonnaruwa project at Aranaganwila Maguldamana Maha Vidyalaya before the presentation of deeds. Acknowledging the best farming families of Mahaweli B and C and Rambakan Oya systems, the President presented special gifts to them.
Minister Daya Gamage, Mahaweli Development State Minister Weerakumara Dissanayake, Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports State Minister Sriyani Wijewickrama, State Minister Anoma Gamage, North Central Province Governor Chamara Sampath Dassanayake, and other officials and ministers and state ministers as well as Secretary of the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Dissanayake, and Mahaweli Authority Director General Sarath Chandrasiri Vithana and others were also present.

CaFFE urges Arjun, Kasun to reveal funded politicians
CaFFE Deputy Director Keerthi Tennakoon had visited Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisea in the Welikada prison and had handed over a letter requesting them to reveal the parliamentarians they funded.
The letter had requested the duo to reveal the names of the parliamentarians they funded during the past election. As you may know, any citizen in the country has the right to donate any amount to election campaigns, religious institutions and other approved organizations. No legal barrier for it either. It is also a right of every citizen and does not breach any election law, the letter stated.
The letter further requests the duo to reveal the donations valued above Rs. 5 lakhs, gifts valued above 1 lakh and the donations valued above one lakh given to politicians and ministers from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2017.
There will be a severe issue about this scam when Parliament commences tomorrow. With the Presidential Secretary Austin Perera out of the country, Parliament would definitely not get the required documents.
The only way to clarify the issue would be to request the donators to reveal the people to whom they gave the money.
Arjun Aloysius and Kasun Palisena have nothing to worry about since campaign financing is not at all illegal in the country.If they come forward with the names, the humiliation of the parliamentarians who did not take any money could also be averted, Keerthi Tennakoon said.

Commuters will benefit while the NTC will lose millions from July 1, 2018 when super luxury buses plying between Matara and Colombo on the southern expressway will reduce the fare to Rs. 460.
Matara Passenger Transport Company (MPTC) Chairman Anura Helapage told a press briefing held at the Matara Rest House yesterday that super luxury Highway bus operators have been hard-hit as there has been a drastic drop in the number of commuters travelling on the Matara - Colombo, Matara - Maharagama, Matara - Kadawatha and Matara - Panadura routes after the government increased fares by 12.5% on May 22.
"Under the new fares revision from midnight on May 22, 2018, the fare between Colombo and Matara which was Rs 530 has risen to Rs 600 while the fare between Matara and Maharagama has seen a Rs 60 increase to Rs 560. Commuters cant afford to pay such high fares and have opted to take use the normal service or the railway, Helapage said.
All of us have route permits to ply between Colombo and Matara and vice versa.The inter provincial service fare between Colombo and Matara after the recent 12.5% fare hike is Rs 460. Our membership has decided to charge commuters only this fare and bear the expressway toll-gate fare and not pay the NTC, he said.

New Anchor Newdale Mango Blast launched
Fonterra Brands Lanka, the company behind Anchor, has launched its latest range of flavoured milk and yoghurts to bring families an exciting, all-new flavour profile that tastes great and provides all the goodness of high quality dairy nutrition.
The new Anchor Newdale Mango Blast range not only presents Sri Lankans with the choice of another much-loved fruity flavour for their dairy nutrition, it also offers a healthier option with the lowest added sugar of major yoghurt and flavoured milk brands. The mango yoghurts contain just 6 per cent added sugar and the mango flavoured milk just 4 per cent, both of which have no sweeteners of any kind.
Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka and the Indian Subcontinent, Sunil Sethi said, Fonterra is committed to creating a healthier and happier Sri Lanka by focusing on developing innovations that meet the nutritional needs of the nation. Our research tells us that when it comes to dairy nutrition, Sri Lankans prize taste over anything else. Kids also want variety and excitement with new flavours and formats to quench their thirst and satisfy their hunger.
By delivering on both taste and nutrition, new flavours like Anchor Newdale Mango Blast help support Sri Lankan farmers by driving demand for locally produced dairy products, while providing families attractive and nutritious choices.
Anchor Newdale Mango Blast is the latest in a range of Fonterra innovations in local dairy, produced from fresh milk. These innovations are part of Fonterras commitment to support Sri Lankas dairy farmers by creating demand for local dairy and increase the volume of local milk collected by Fonterra, estimated at 10 per cent growth annually.
In 2017 Fonterra relaunched its strawberry flavoured range and immediately saw a double-digit growth in demand for yoghurt post-launch, in comparison to the previous three months.
Earlier this year, Fonterra launched its low-fat Anchor Drinking Yoghurt in two highly popular flavours, Vanilla and Mango Passion.
For 40 years, Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka has provided Sri Lankans with high quality dairy nutrition through a range of products, including Anchor. As a dairy cooperative owned by over 10,500 New Zealand farmers, we are also focused on sharing our expertise locally with dairy farmers to help create a thriving local dairy industry. Today we work indirectly with 100,000 people across the country through our network of business partners to help make Sri Lanka a healthier, happier nation.

Minister Mahinda Amaraweera responding to the Daily News said the main focus of the joint meeting was on party reorganisation that will ensure the SLFPs victory at the Provincial Council Election which would be held in the end of this year. Minister Amaraweera also said some of the new appointments were done on a temporary basis.
He said that the SLFP members had not discussed anything about leaving the coalition government and added the focus was on restructuring the party to meet future challenges.
A member of the SLFP Group of 16 who recently decided relinquish their posts and sit in the opposition, SLFP Senior Vice President, John Seneviratne MP told Daily News that President Maithripala Sirisena and the new General Secretary spoke at the joint meeting while former General Secretary delivered the welcome speech.
It was pointed out that SLFP has contributed much to the betterment of the general public of this country. We should not allow it to get destroyed, it was also pointed out. It was also said that the party needs to be reorganised and strengthen before taking any crucial decision, MP Seneviratne speaking on the discussion content said.
Asked if the SLFP Group 16 made any special observations at the joint meeting, Seneviratne said that they did not, as the group of 16 is still a part of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. We walked out of the government because we disagreed with some policies taken up by it. But we are still a part of the SLFP, he said.
Seneviratne said that during discussions several members had pointed out that the SLFP lost at the last LG elections as the economic measures of the government had been rejected by the people.
Also he said several members had expressed that the the SLFPs political alignment with the UNP too had hurt the party at the polls.

Organic fertiliser usage encouraged
The government has made a policy decision to promote using organic fertiliser among farmers to bring down to zero the Rs. 48,000 million loan taken for inorganic fertiliser subsidy soon, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He said Rs. 36,000 million of the loan of Rs. 48,000 million was paid by the good governance government after they came into power.
Minister Amaraweera said the government had since then been able to urge 5,000 farmers to use organic fertiliser, which yielded six million kg of organic rice last year.
The Minister said the fertiliser subsidy would be granted to the farmers using organic fertiliser as well. He said the Cabinet has already approved the Ministry to provide the fertiliser subsidy to the farmers using organic fertiliser.
The Ministry is seeking possibilities to provide them with seed paddy and other saplings for free. He said the Ministry will provide the machinery needed for organic fertiliser using farmers.
The government took measures to encourage at least 20,000 farmers in using organic fertiliser during the Maha season this year, Minister Amaraweera said.
The Minister said the Agriculture Ministry along with the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) and Agrarian Development Department had already taken steps to encourage farmers in using organic fertiliser.

Significant drop in influenza patients
Epidemiology Unit Director Dr. Anil Dissanayake said the number of patients with suspected or confirmed influenza have decreased significantly.
The number of patients have reduced. Yet we are vigilant of the outbreak of influenza. We are collecting statistics and have alerted every hospital in the country and have provided them guidelines on how to act in such situations, Dr. Dissanayake said.
Dr. Dissanayake also added that hospital staff in vulnerable areas are working tirelessly to treat every patient. This is a seasonal influenza which we have been experiencing in the past years as well. Even other countries experience such situations. There is nothing to panic but people have to be alert to prevent the influenza from spreading, he commented. Dr. Dissanayake also added that there is no threat of the influenza spreading in other provinces.
Earlier, there were reports that the recent influenza in Southern Province was spreading fast.
It was reported that there have been 19 deaths so far, including children due to fever. Sources claimed that the hospitals in the province are overflowing with patients with fever.
ICUs in the district were also overflowing with patients having fever and this includes the ICUs in private hospitals as well.
Dr. Dissanayake said that every hospital has been supplied with needed medicine for treatment.
We also ask the community to play your role properly. The cause for the deaths associated with influenza is mostly due to the delay in seeking medical care, sometimes patients wait until they have severe illness and respiratory difficulty to seek medical help. We advice people who have similar symptoms to get treatment immediately, he stressed.

SL scientist invents bulb to control influenza virus
Manju Gunawardene, a scientist attached to the Sri Lanka Institute of Nanotechnology, has invented a bulb to control the influenza virus.
The bulb, which has received world acclaim, helped him to win a gold medal at the World New Inventions Congress held in Geneva in 2012.
Gunawardene said epidemics are spread through three main venues - through hospitals, patients suffering from epidemics and long exposure to particles in the air.
We detected a nano particle which can destroy any bacteria, waste or any virus. We applied this nano particle to the surface of the blub.
Patient suffering from influenza, diarrhea, allergy, eye disease or viral bacterial or epidemic condition can be recovered by keeping the bulb lit, he said.
He said, however, he approached several authorities in the health field in Sri Lanka to make them aware of the importance of his invention, but to date, they did not use his invention to benefit the public.

Speaking to journalists at his Official Residence on Friday, the Speaker denied claims that the Presidential Commission of Inquiry report that looked into the questionable Central Bank Treasury Bond issuance contains a list of 118 MPs who had obtained money from Aloysius.
As far as I am aware, it has only given a list of MPs who have had telephone conversations with Aloysius and the number of such calls made. No where it has given a list of MPs who had obtained money from Aloysius. These claims are affecting negatively to the honourable status of the MPs. Therefore I wish to make an announcement in this regard on Tuesday in Parliament and table the available list of names, he told journalists.
