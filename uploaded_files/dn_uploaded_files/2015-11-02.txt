Amazing Discovery of 22 shipwrecks off Greece
GREECE: In the Fourni archipelago of the Greek Aegean region, towering underwater cliffs descend into the darkness of the deep sea. Marine archaeologists comb these murky depths for objects made by human hands - a ceramic shard encrusted with sea sponges, or an ancient vase that an eel has claimed for its home.
Through the centuries here, human handiwork has been absorbed by its natural aquatic surroundings, with rock and reef steadily growing around any remnants of life from early Western civilization.
The seeming improbability, then, of finding substantive artifacts in the patchwork makes discovery all the more exciting.
"You're constantly scanning in any direction," Peter Campbell, an underwater archaeologist at the University of Southampton, told The Washington Post. "There's this moment that you see something, a straight line that doesn't look natural, and your eye kind of flips over. You realize it's an ancient pot or ancient anchor, then you notice this stuff is everywhere."
While undertaking a survey of possible wreckage around Fourni last month, Campbell and his team experienced this sense of wonder an unprecedented 22 times over.
When Campbell and the expedition's co-director, Greek archaeologist George Koutsouflakis, arrived at the collection of the thirteen islands and islets in mid-September, they had heard some rumblings of artifacts from ancient ships to be found in the area.
As luck would have it, they came across a shipwreck on their very first dive, which the team took to be "a good omen." Over the course of less than two weeks - the duration of their survey permit - they would have been content to find three or four wrecks in total.
After the first five days, that number hit ten. Then, on a single day, they found an additional six.
At this point, overwhelmed with the unexpected fortune, they decided to stop looking for wrecks so they could focus on adequately recording information from the ones they had already encountered. But even this decision didn't stop them from finding a few more by the expedition's end, making the sum uncovered in just 13 days an astounding 22 shipwrecks.
During this short period, Campbell and Koutsouflakis's crew of marine archaeologists, local fishermen, sponge divers and the occasional robot (read: remotely-operated vehicle) increased the total number of known ancient shipwrecks in Greece by 12 percent.
An announcement this week revealed that the survey, a collaborative effort between the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and the Florida-based RPM Nautical Foundation, yielded shipwrecks dating from the Archaic Period (700-480 B.C.) through the Late Medieval Period (16th century), including some wrecks that are more than 2,500 years old.
The small and relatively obscure region may be "the ancient shipwreck capital of the world," the release says.
While a comparable number of wrecks have been discovered in major harbor sites like Pisa, Copenhagen and London, Campbell said, this find is significant because there was no major settlement or port in Fourni, which was merely a popular passing-through point.
These shipwrecks, however, illustrate just how crucial a passageway the small archipelago was for seafaring merchants of the ancient times. The storms that ravaged the neighboring islands of Samos and Icaria were so fierce that sailors often took refuge in Fourni's abundance of gentle bays. The archipelago lies along a major east-west crossing route, as well as the primary north-south path from the Aegean to the Levant.
The large number of shipwrecks found suggests not that Fourni was an uncommonly dangerous locale, but rather that it welcomed an immense volume of sea traffic over a long period of time. Campbell estimates that there was likely no more than one wreck every hundred years.
By the time scientists can reach wrecks of this kind, any organic materials - wood, clothing, bodies - have long been eaten away by their environment. A shipwreck, then, is comprised of several hundred pieces of pottery, indicating the bulk of a ship's cargo, that fan out from a distinct area.
Campbell said all the wrecks they found were from typical merchant sailing vessels and not from any warships.
"That suits us pretty well," he said. "These shipwrecks tell the story of the every day person, and we're really interested in what life was like for the average sailor in 400 B.C."
According to the archaeologist, the narrative that emerges is one of a unique marine culture, in which a global sensibility permeated not only the objects that were shipped, but also the demographic makeup of the sailing crews. These outfits were often multicultural and multilingual, and were even known to have their own "mixed" language - the singular speech of men who spent most of their lives on water.
The ships carrying the found wreckage were all following the same trade route, Campbell said. It was one that connected the North Aegean and the Black Sea region to the Levant, Cyprus, Palestine and Egypt.
While historical texts had previously given archaeologists a general idea of how merchants sailed these routes, the wreckage around Fourni allows their travels to be traced in a way that was never before possible.
"This is one of the top discoveries in terms of what it can tell us about ancient maritime trade," Campbell said. By combining terrestrial studies with close analyses of the unearthed ceramics, it will be possible to reconstruct entire itineraries of ancient voyages.
The amphoras (tall containers with two handles and a narrow neck) created back then had designs that were distinctive to their originating nation-states, so piecing together those patterns could yield quite a comprehensive understanding of the various stops that each ship made on their voyages.

Bill Clinton urges Israelis to finish what Yitzhak Rabin started
ISRAEL: Former US President Bill Clinton urged Israelis to continue supporting the moribund peace process with the Palestinians, despite the setbacks of the past two decades.
Every day you have to choose hope over fear, empowerment over acceptance, confidence over cynicism, he said at a mass rally in central Tel Aviv, marking 20 years since the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
Thousands of left-wing and centrist Israelis attended the rally.
President Barack Obama, in a recorded video message, also called on Israelis to continue their support for the two-state solution and talks with the Palestinians, despite a new wave of
I still believe what I said two years ago, that peace is necessary, just and possible, Obama said. Peace is necessary because it is the only way to bring true and lasting security for Israelis and Palestinians.
Clinton, who sealed the 1993 interim Oslo accords two years before Rabin died, said it was up to the younger generation to finish his legacy.
Ten years ago when I was honoured to stand in this space, I said if I could miraculously bring Rabin back to life and he were standing here with me, he'd say: Enough with this bragging about me. Let's get back to work and finish what I gave my life to do. And so all of you here must decide ... how to finish his legacy, for the last chapter must be written by the people he gave his life for.
On November 5, 1995, Rabin was shot dead on the same square where people gathered Saturday night. His assassin was Yigal Amir, a radical Jew opposed to his peace moves with the Palestinians.
Two decades after the assassination, many Israelis have become deeply disillusioned with the persistently deadlocked peace process, which has since lost widespread support.
There have even been statements by some on the far-right endorsing Amir's actions, to the outrage of Israelis elsewhere on the political spectrum.
Security was tight at Saturday's rally, as it came during the worst spell of street violence in years. Police used buses two block off all accesses to the central square, which, since the assassination, was renamed Rabin Square.
Clinton and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin spoke behind bulletproof glass.
Dozens of knife attacks against Israelis have been committed by Palestinians since early October. Israeli security forces have used tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition against Palestinian protesters throwing rocks and gasoline bombs at flash points in the West Bank and along the Gaza border.
In the latest incident of violence earlier Saturday, Israeli border policemen shot dead an 18-year-old Palestinian at a crossing points from the northern West Bank into Israel, police said.
They thought the Palestinian was raising a knife against them and when he did not obey calls to freeze, opened fire, spokeswoman Luba Samri said.

Britney Spears: Tisto is teaching me to master the decks
Britney Spears is being taught to DJ by Tisto. The 33-year-old singer is more well known for her skills on the stage than the decks. But on Saturday (October 31), Britney revealed she is learning the craft of spinning records by none other than legendary Dutch DJ Tisto.
The mother of two also teased fans that she could be collaborating with Tisto on an upcoming track.
Britney posted of herself standing next to the DJ on her Instagram page, alongside the caption: "Asked @tiesto to teach me how to DJ. Maybe we'll get a song out of it"
Britney has been kept busy in recent months thanks to her Britney: Piece of Me residency in Las Vegas.
However, the singer revealed in a previous interview that in between her shows, she has been working "very slowly" on music for a new album. The record would be Britney's ninth studio album but she said she wants to push the boundaries with her music with the record.
"I want to do something very artsy-fartsy, something I've never done before..." Britney told US TV show Extra in September (14).
But Britney will have the majority of her time taken up after recently announcing that her residency has been further extended for another two years.
Her Britney: Piece of Me gig at Planet Hollywood plays to packed-out crowds, with the blonde belting out her catchy pop anthems.
"I have some big news tonight," Britney told the audience at one of her shows in September (15) as she confirmed the exciting development. "Usually I get you guys to help me count to three, but tonight I want you to help me count to two... because I'm going to be in Vegas for two more years!" she screamed to the audience, with the crowd whopping in response.
Planet Hollywood also released a statement confirming the news. It's still exciting for fans that have already caught the show; Britney plans to give it a glitzy new makeover.
"[It] will soon undergo a substantial [re-imagining]," the statement read.
"[Which will allow the Britney to] take her spectacular show to new heights." Music - News

Candy Crush(ed)
Speaking at a question and answer session in India, Facebook founder says he will find a solution to the problem of annoying game notifications.
Its up there as one of the most irritating things about Facebook  along with the fact your entire extended family just joined. A few years ago, FarmVille invitation notifications were the scourge of the social network (I dont want to play with virtual sheep, but thank you)  now it is invites to play the puzzle game Candy Crush Saga.
But there is hope. Mark Zuckerberg has announced at a question-and-answer session that his team of developers are working on a solution.
The top-rated comment, with 7,500 likes, in response to Zuckerbergs call-out for users questions before his talk at the the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Delhi was a straight-to-the-point: I dont want any more invitations to Candy Crush. How can I stop it
When the question was read out at the talk, people cheered.
This is where these Town Hall Q&As are really useful because I actually saw this question, that it was the top voted question on my thread, Zuckerberg said.
So I sent a message to the person who runs the team in charge of our developer platform and I said by the time I do this Town Hall Q&A, I think it would be good if we had a solution to this problem.
In response to a wider question about games notifications being an annoyance for people who dont play games on Facebook, Zuckerberg added:
We hadnt prioritised shutting that down because we just had other priorities but if this is the top thing that people care about then well prioritise that and well do it.
Zuckerberg didnt elaborate further on how the changes would work in practice, and the maker of Candy Crush Saga, King, hasnt commented. But if Zuckerberg implements changes that also stop our grandmothers asking us to play online Scrabble, its a win for us all.

Coal case: SC grants leave to proceed with FR petition
The Supreme Court yesterday granted leave to proceed with a fundamental rights petition filed by a Singaporean company over alleged irregularities said to have taken place when supplying coal to Lanka Coal Company Ltd in 2015.
The petitioner Noble Resources International Pte Limited had cited 75 parties including the President, Cabinet ministers and Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited as respondents.
The petitioner stated that it has been supplying coal to Lanka Coal Company Ltd from around or about November 2010 to date.
The petitioner stated that the petitioner supplied approximately 2.5 million metric tones of coal to Lanka Coal Company Ltd.
The petitioner stated that there has never been any complaint of the quality of coal supplied and the late delivery of coal.
The petitioner stated that in fact there has been no complaint against the petitioner of any kind of nature.
The petitioner stated that the Technical Evaluation Committee evaluated the bids and arrived at a decision that the petitioner was the lowest responsive tenderer and recommended that grant of the contract to the petitioner.
The petitioner further stated that Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited whose tender was approximately US Dollars 91.55 million higher than that of the petitioner complained to the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) about 2 of the criteria for evaluation specified in the bid document.
The SCAPC directed the TEC to remove the said 2 criteria for evaluation from the bid documents and to evaluate from the bid documents and evaluate the contract without such criteria.
The respondents maintained that as per the recommendation to issue the contract to Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited, the cost to the government would increase by Rs.1.62 billion.
The petitioner believes that the Cabinet was only informed that TEC, SCAPC had recommended that grant of the contract to the respondent company without disclosing that aforesaid criteria in the bid document had been taken out that TEC had evaluated and recommended the petitioner as the Lower Responsive bidder as per the bid documents.
The petitioner is seeking an order to set aside the decision of the Cabinet of ministers to award the concerned tender to Swiss Singapore Enterprises Pte Limited in September 22, 2015.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne fixed the petition for hearing on December 15.

## Title: Denial of Democracy

Denial of Democracy
In a democracy, the representation of the people is the foremost duty of parliamentarians. In the last few decades or so did they perform their primary function satisfactorily or live up to the expectations of the citizens Their performance has been unethical, disgraceful, un-parliamentary, and disorderly. They did bring in immense shame and disrepute to the august Assembly.
The Parliament therefore in order to ensure orderly business of the house, need to upgrade its quality of performance as a matter of priority. In keeping with the past practices and procedures of our own and the Mother Parliament  British House of Commons, we need to take necessary steps (very firmly) to apply and enforce the guidelines, rules, regulations and even precedents and traditions, both written and unwritten, without delay. It is the Speakers duty, proficiently assisted by the Secretary-General of Parliament, to interpret Standing Orders, impartially to maintain order and decorum in the Supreme Legislature.
The latest unruly incident that took place in Parliament was when the old-timer parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena, former Chief Government Whip, ran away with the Mace causing pandemonium. This was supported by many others including a party leader. The Mace is the symbol of authority of the Parliament and the Speaker, which is placed on the Table by the Sergeant-at-Arms before the Sittings of Parliament begins each day.
National goals
The Speaker depends mostly on numerous sources to arrive at good decisions. Erskine May was the Clerk of the House of Commons, between the period, 1871 to 1886, who wrote  Treatise on the Law, privileges, Proceeding and Usage of Parliament. This is considered to be the most authoritative source on parliamentary, practice and procedure, widely referred to and used in the Commonwealth Parliaments. This book is also one which provides good guidance to our Speaker and the Secretary-General too to run our Parliament efficiently and effectively.
As I have observed, for a period well over thirty years, the Parliament has been traditionally a noisy place. In Sri Lankan context, the disruptions that occur almost daily in Parliament, may I say, is nothing other than hooliganism. It could be argued that they play politics - perhaps induced by the quest of a specific pre-determined role to achieve personal or group objectives in Parliament. It could be also said that these legislators had always chosen to pursue their personal and collective goals of their group selfishly by adopting strategies - that is prescriptions as to how they could most successfully invest their energies to maximize the likelihood of a preferred outcome  unquestionably not the national goals. How sad it is
These disruptions no doubt had resulted in reducing the debating time drastically. I recall certain laws had been simply passed on several occasions without even a debate. This is a denial of democracy to the citizen. If so, do the citizenry need such a Parliament, an unbearable expenditure
In fact, owing to these reasons, the Speaker must be advised to adopt a rehabilitated and more enlightened strategy immediately. Speaker could then recommence the proven age old practice and procedure of naming unruly MPs, which had sadly been discontinued. I would say we have no option at all but to revert to the classical English procedure in British Parliament.
If we do so, we could be heading again to a more open progressive parliamentary system (similar to pre 1970 period) encompassing a desire for a balanced governance, in order for the promotion of civic virtues, and the resistance to bad governance. Our parliamentarians do not seem to have matured democratically in the interest of the country and its people. They seem to be dragging the country to become a failed State highhandedly, if not properly check-mated using parliamentary oversight mechanism.
The Parliament being the legislative body consisting of elected representatives to pass laws and monitoring of performance of the executive authority, the role of the Speaker, strengthened by the Secretary-General indecisive.
Abusive un-parliamentary language
The Speaker must therefore search and investigate to find new and better avenues for taking the right decisions and to assist parliamentarians to improve and perform their onerous duties well, in the interest of the country and its people. It must not be forgotten the desired change must be made a reality  not a fantasy.
It is a must therefore for the present Speaker to be given appropriate guidance at this particular juncture. Speaker must be supported whole-heartedly with commitment and skill to pursue the right path. This is the responsibility of the Parliament Secretariat. In particular, the Secretary-General must now take up the total responsibility to focus Speakers direction to ensure an acceptable, people friendly, dignified, enlightened, effective and efficient role in Parliament for all the parliamentarians, whether they belong to the government or opposition.
The countrymen in the past experienced all types of serious eruptions in Parliament, due to which physical blows had been exchanged, a Buddhist priest physically manhandled, used abusive un-parliamentary language on the floor of the House and Parliamentarians staged a protest overnight - which no doubt was the first-of-the kind, which should not have been excused or tolerated at all.
The Speaker had most pragmatically pointed out that a sum of Rs.4.6 million is spent for a day to maintain Parliament. In other words, the Speaker urged all elected representatives to examine top issues under consideration, decide on policy and laws, and hold the government accountable for its actions, without unnecessarily wasting time and valuable resources in Parliament for unworthy squabbles.
There have been repeated instances in Parliament when the MPs disregarded the authority of the Speaker. The House is then suspended to resolve the relevant dispute in order to work out an amicable settlement in the Speakers Chambers. This practice began during the Speakership of former UNP past master Lokubandara. The genius preferred avoiding rough sea and sidestepped without using disciplinary powers vested in the Speaker in the Standing Orders.
This system needs to be totally disbanded because this has now become the order of the day for unruly parliamentarians. There has been days the Parliament had been suspended repeatedly, without adhering to the laid down and accepted practice and procedure in the House. The past practice should be re-introduced in the august Assembly at the earliest.
The usual procedure according to the Standing Orders is to name a member when he/she disregard the authority of the Chair and willfully obstruct the House by continuously refusing to comply with the Standing Orders. Under similar circumstances, the Speaker or the Chairperson says  (I name MP .) and thereafter, the Leader of the House, the Chief Government Whip or a senior Minister present moves that Mr. ., MP., be suspended from the House, for which a division may be called for.
Role of the Speaker
In the past all MPs irrespective of their party affiliations supported similar moves by the Chair in order to maintain the dignity, decorum and prestige of the august Assembly. The role of the Speaker is so important and therefore the primary duty after an election is to elect a Speaker, who is also referred to as the Presiding Officer very often. The Speaker is the third citizen in the country. The Speaker is responsible to maintain the authority of the House and to protect its rights, privileges and the dignity of the Parliament.
It is the duty cast upon the Secretary-General who should essentially create necessary conditions to guide the Speaker on the right path so that personal preferences will not be allowed at the cost of the institutional procedure, in the Supreme Legislature.
However, this is achievable only if pursued appropriately, with commitment, sincerity, dedication and hard work by the Secretary-General and his Staff.
It reminds me of the Canadian Clerk of the House (Secretary-General), whom I had the opportunity to meet when I had the good fortune to go for an attachment to the Canadian Parliament for a training.
He was a painstakingly dedicated, committed and a colossus of a gentleman and told me that he leaves abroad only once a year.
He added that he had extensively travelled as a junior officer in Parliament. (The juniors are given minimum opportunities and the seniors fully exhaust these privileges in Sri Lanka!!) He wisecracked the Parliament Secretariat needs detailed supervision and good leadership on the part of the Secretary-General and added that he was fully satisfied with what the Secretariat has achieved under his leadership. The plight of Sri Lankan Parliament Secretariat is indeed a tale of woe.
I sincerely believe that we should admire and show gratitude always to the military for their commitment, their discipline, their dedication and the code of ethics they observed in fighting the war with the LTTE.
We had heroes in the three forces and police, without their enduring commitment and sacrifice, we could never have won the war in a country full of heavies who have only personal goals but not for the benefit of the people.
I have no doubt if the Speaker wishes to be successful - he primarily needs a competent Secretariat and a staff who are willing to develop a vision and good foresight in order to reach out that far-away end.
This is urgent. If not the present Speaker too, I repeat - would sink in a mighty ocean similar to most of his predecessors  a failure.

Dilshan shines as Sri Lanka win rain-hit ODI
Tillakaratne Dilshan smashed 59 off 32 balls as Sri Lanka edged past the West Indies by one wicket in the rain-curtailed first one-day international in Colombo on Sunday (Nov 1).
Set a Duckworth-Lewis target of 163 in 26 overs, the hosts survived anxious moments before winning with seven balls to spare at the Premadasa stadium to grab the lead in the three-match series.
Dilshan hit six boundaries and three sixes before Sri Lanka floundered while chasing the revised target after the West Indies, sent in to bat, had scored 159-8 in their 26 overs.
The hosts, cruising at 104-2, lost seven wickets for 48 runs before tailender Ajantha Mendis hit the winning six off Johnson Charles in the company of last man Suranga Lakmal.
The start of the day-night match was delayed by an hour and 20 minutes due to persistent rain. Further bad weather during the West Indies innings reduced the game to 26 overs-a-side.
Dilshan put on 46 for the first wicket with Kusal Perera and 43 for the second with Lahiru Thirimanne to give Sri Lanka a bright start. But spinner Sunil Narine claimed three wickets, and Carlos Brathwaite and Jonathan Carter took two each, to cause a sensational Sri Lankan collapse when all seemed lost for the West Indies.
Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews admitted his side was "lucky" to win the match. "It was a lucky escape," he said. "We made a real mess out of the game. But the lesson has been learnt. The bowlers did a great job, but we should have finished the game sooner than we did. It was good to see Mendis take up the challenge with the bat."
West Indies skipper Jason Holder said it was hard to lose a game which his team had come so close to winning. "It was a tough loss since we came so close at the end," he said. "But I am not too disappointed. Credit to the boys for fighting back both with the bat and the ball."
Andre Russell and Darren Bravo put on 58 runs off 37 balls to steer the West Indies to 159-8 after they slipped to 24-3 before the rain break and then became 42-4 soon after resumption.
Russell smashed three sixes and as many fours in 41 off 24 balls and left-handed Bravo chipped in with 38 during an entertaining fifth-wicket stand to retrieve the situation.
Skipper Holder then hit 36 off 13 balls with three sixes and two boundaries as the West Indies plundered 59 runs in the final five overs. Lakmal claimed the first three wickets and spinner Mendis took two.
Sri Lanka swept the preceding Test series 2-0. The second one-dayer will be played at the same venue on Wednesday. The one-day series will be followed by two Twenty20 games.

## Title: Everything you ever wanted to know about teeth

Everything you ever wanted to know about teeth
Once, it was a simple question of up and down or round and round. Today, toothbrushing  a basic ritual of personal hygiene  is fraught with decisions: Should you use an oscillating electric brush, or a giant, rubber-flanged monster brush Is it worth investing in mouthwash, or is tap water just as good
The main reason we brush our teeth is to remove plaque, a sticky film of bacteria that grows on their surface. Some of these bacteria produce substances that irritate the gums. Others convert sugar into acid, which erodes the teeth. Bacteria also produce stinky substances that cause bad breath. But with so many potential ways of removing plaque from our mouths, how do you know what is best for your teeth Heres the latest scientific evidence.
Q: Whats the most effective way to brush your teeth
The Dental Health Foundation reports that one-in-four Brits think electric toothbrushes are for lazy people. That may be so, but unless you are particularly gifted with a manual toothbrush, they do generally result in cleaner teeth  particularly those with an oscillating head. When the Cochrane Oral Health Group  a group of dentists charged with publishing summaries of the best available evidence  looked at this issue, it concluded that, over three months, using an electric brush was associated with a 21% reduction in plaque and an 11% reduction in gum inflammation compared with manual brushing.
That is not to say that manual toothbrushes are useless, however. They work pretty well, if you use them properly; the problem is that most people develop a system over time, and its not uncommon for them to miss areas, says Derek Richards, director of the Centre for Evidence-based Dentistry in Dundee. If you prefer to use a manual brush, Richards advises choosing one with a smallish head and medium bristles to ensure that you reach all the nooks and crannies. As for technique, Richards says: Its about finding what works for you.
Q: When should I brush them
At least twice a day  before bed, and at one other time. An ongoing area of disagreement is whether you should brush before, or after, breakfast. It depends on what you have eaten, says Rebecca Moazzez, director of the oral clinical research unit at Kings College London (KCL) Dental Institute: The main thing to be careful of is fruit juice or fresh fruit, because they contain acid that can make the surface of the tooth quite soft. This softening causes some of the calcium and phosphate in the protective enamel to leach out  a process called demineralisation  and if you brush your teeth at this point, you will be brushing some of these minerals away and weakening the teeth. Quite how long you should avoid brushing for remains unclear; the overall pH of the mouth seems to return to normal within minutes, but tooth surfaces may remain soft for up to an hour. If you want to do anything after eating, I would simply wash with a fluoride mouthwash, Moazzez says.
Q: Do I have to use toothpaste
Brushing protects against gum disease, but its the fluoride in toothpaste that prevents tooth decay, says Maria Therese Hosey, head of paediatric dentistry at KCL. Because of the foods we eat, our teeth are constantly demineralising and remineralising; if fluoride is present during the remineralisation process, it gets incorporated and strengthens the teeth. For this reason, adults should look for a toothpaste that contains at least 1,350ppm fluoride, and steer clear of alternatives sucn as bicarbonate of soda, which are too abrasive to be used for tooth-cleaning. Think Brillo pad on a non-stick pan, says Therese Hosey.
Ironically, failing to remove every last trace of plaque can actually be beneficial for the teeth, because it concentrates fluoride on their surface. For a similar reason, its best to avoid rinsing the mouth after brushing. It means high levels of fluoride are retained on the teeth, Richards says.
Q: What about mouthwash
Using a fluoride mouthwash straight after brushing is fairly pointless: youre flushing away fluoride and replacing it with more of the same.
Where it can come in handy, however, is in topping up fluoride levels in between toothbrushing  particularly if youre at high risk of cavities. It can also be useful if you have had something acidic to eat, so dont want to brush, says Therese Hosey.
Of course, mouthwashes contain more than just fluoride; many contain antiseptic agents such as chlorhexidine, which kill some of the bacteria your toothbrush misses, and help freshen the breath. But while there is some evidence that such mouthwashes can reduce plaque and gum inflammation, Richards says: If youre brushing your teeth twice or three times a day with a fluoride toothpaste, the additional benefit you will get isnt likely to be huge.
Q: And dental floss
Plaque accumulates between the teeth, as well as on their surfaces, and this is difficult to remove using a toothbrush alone. The risk here is gum disease, which in its early stages manifests as bleeding when you brush. When the Cochrane Oral Health Group looked at this issue, it concluded that people who brush and floss regularly experience less gum-bleeding compared with those who use brushing alone. However, it said most trials assessing this have been of poor quality.
Similarly, although there is some evidence that interdental brushes are more effective than floss at reducing gum inflammation, the quality of available evidence means it is difficult to say for sure.
Q: Is chewing gum good or bad for teeth
So long as it is sugar-free, chewing gum is generally a good thing for teeth. For one thing, it stimulates saliva production, which buffers the acid that erodes teeth. It can also help dislodge particles of food from the teeth.
Then there is chewing gum containing xylitol  a low-calorie sweetener that the bacteria responsible for causing tooth decay seem to prefer over sugar.
If they are hoovering up less sugar, this means they are producing less acid, which is good news for teeth.
What is unclear, however, is how much of this gum we would need to chew to achieve a measurable impact.
Q: Whats the best way to look after childrens teeth
Milk teeth eventually fall out and get replaced by adult teeth, but if they are left to get so rotten that they have to be prematurely extracted, it can have long-term consequences for your childs mouth: Baby teeth guide the position for the permanent teeth, so if you lose a lot of your baby teeth, youre more likely to have problems later on, says Richards. Tooth decay is also the number one reason for general anaesthetic use in children, which carries risks of its own.
Although official guidelines recommend brushing childrens teeth fortwo to three minutes, twice a day, as any parent will testify, getting a two-year-old to comply is like asking a crocodile to release your leg from its jaws. The pragmatic answer is that if you are managing to brush all tooth surfaces using a fluoride toothpaste, then you are doing a pretty good job, says Therese Hosey.
Q: Do I really need to visit my dentist every six months
Possibly  if your teeth are in bad shape. But seeing your dentist every six months just for the sake of it could be an unnecessary expense  particularly if they are prone to offering treatments such as a scale and polish each time you visit. The Cochrane Oral Health Group recently concluded that there was no good evidence to support six-monthly dental checkups; a finding echoed by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence. It suggests that children under the age of 18 should see a dentist at least once a year, because their teeth tend to decay faster. For adults who are not experiencing any problems with their teeth, though, every 24 months should be adequate.

Fan favourite Sonny Bill gets new medal
London: All Blacks centre Sonny Bill Williams was Sunday presented with a new World Cup winners' medal to replace the one he handed to a young fan after Saturday's final victory over Australia.
The boy, identified as 15-year-old Charlie Lines, was thrown to the ground by a security official after running on to the Twickenham pitch following New Zealand's 34-17 triumph. The 30-year-old Williams played down the incident which also saw teammate and flanker Liam Meesam give the teenager his black beanie hat. AFP

Modi
Jayalalithaa
Worried over repeated instances of Indian fishermen being apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking "a lasting solution to this long-pending vexatious problem."
In her letter, the Chief Minister said: "This livelihood issue of thousands of our fisherfolk needs your personal intervention."
Recalling that she had written seven letters regarding the pathetic plight of 86 fishermen from Tamil Nadu who have been incarcerated in Sri Lankan jails and whose boats impounded by the Sri Lankan authorities, Jayalalithaa said the External Affairs Ministry, in response to her request, had informed the state that the Sri Lankan government had expressed its readiness for the simultaneous release of fishermen in custody on both sides.
State government officers had been in constant touch with the External Affairs Ministry officials and they have been told that all the fishermen from Tamil Nadu would soon reach home after fulfilling the required formalities.
Even as Tamil Nadu is eagerly awaiting their arrival, six more fishermen, along with their mechanised boat from Rameswaram, were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy on October 31 and taken to Thalaimannar, Jayalalithaa pointed out.

GREENER PASTURES!
Looking back at the past I have doubts whether I would be able to achieve what I have done today if I follow the same footsteps. It is most likely that I would not choose music as my career. I would not even study music. I would not become a vocalist, a musician or a music director then.
His melodious voice sends listeners into a trance-like mood but ask maestro Victor Ratnayake if he would have taken the same musical route if he was 21 today and his firm "no" takes you by surprise!
"The world has changed so much today. This has taken its toll on Sri Lanka. The change is for worse rather than better. Every sector has deteriorated. This includes music, education, culture, religion, health, politics, cinema, language etc. People are after wealth and power. They would stoop to any level to get what they want. Nothing and no one is spared. No even children and infants," laments the seasoned musician whose voice crossed all boundaries of class, race and religion and had healed many souls for decades.
He notes that he was 21 years old when he ventured to Colombo, hunting for his fortune. Destiny led him to the Institute of Aesthetic Studies and then to the Ministry of Education as a music instructor.
"Looking back at the past I have doubts whether I would be able to achieve what I have done today if I follow the same footsteps. It is most likely that I would not choose music as my career. I would not even study music. I would not become a vocalist, a musician or a music director then," he said.
This means that fans would have missed out on his celebrated 'Sa' series. 'Sa' was the first solo performance by a Sri Lankan artiste. It set a trend which was followed by many contemporaries. Wouldn't this decision be unfair to music enthusiasts
"It is a sad fact but that is how the world has turned out today. Practically everything has a price. Everything is marketed. Even sectors like the police which are appointed to stop corruption can be bribed. The easiest thing that everyone is trying to do is find a means to get into the Government side," he expressed.
Ratnayake's success formula lies in his attempt to bridge western music with the Ragadari classical music. His first song was an olde to the Buddha in 1964.
Even when he speaks, his syllables are sheer music as he recalls his cherished memories.
"We can enter our childhood environ only through lyrics now. We had plenty of free time at hand. Our parents encouraged us to explore and learn through experience. This fueled our creativity and imagination," he said while adding that it is this environment which mounded him into who he is today.
"My father, Ratnayake Veda Mahaththaya, was a well known apothecary in Kadugannawa. He sang Sinhala folk songs called 'noorthi gee'. That is where my talent comes from," said the musician whose songs cover diverse themes from love to patriotism and childhood memories.
Then if he would not choose music as his career what profession would he have gone for if he is 21 today
"That is a tough decision. It needs much thought. I cannot decide on a specific sector at the moment. However I think I would have migrated to another country. That is because I cannot stay here to witness the harm that has been done to my motherland," he noted with regret.
Though he believes that he would leave Sri Lanka had he been in his youth, Ratnayake was quick to add that he thinks Sri Lanka is the most beautiful country in the world.
It is truly a paradise. There is no other nation in the world which has the resources that we have here. We can venture from a humid city like Colombo to a cooler region like Nuwara Eliya within a few hours. We are surrounded by lush beaches and sand dunes. There is greenery everywhere. This could have been heaven on earth if human beings do not misuse what they have been blessed with, he pointed out adding that there is not national policy for any sector. Therefore everything has gone havoc in the country.
I am not saying that there is no hope. There are still a few things which remain untainted in the Sri Lanka. All these problems arose because incorrect and inappropriate things have been taught to the youth. The media is mostly to be blamed for this. The media is a powerful tool which can make as well as break a country, he stressed.
Speaking about the latest gadgets in the modern world, Ratnayake noted that sky is the limit when it comes to advanced technology. However he states that many are misusing these devices rather than using them to uplift the music industry.
Such devices need to be used wisely. Then only we can make full use of them. For instance some vocalists mime on stage during live performances. Who are they trying to kid If they know the subject thoroughly they would not try to cheat the fans in such a manner, he opined.
Romance is a universal topic for Ratnayake. He says that it is not something which can be limited to a specific age.
Though many attribute romance with youth, practically speaking, age is not a barrier. A mans physique is the most beautiful sight for a woman and vice versa. There are no laws or rules for romance. The primitive man as well as animals too shares romantic feelings, he said.
I feel content today because I have many good memories. My achievements are hard won but each of them is a bitter sweet experience.
If you asked me the same question 52 years ago when I was actually 21 years old, my answer would have been on a more positive note. But the harsh reality is that I am unable to give a reply which is like music for your ears today, he concluded with a sigh.

How Do You Find a 'Lost' Masterpiece
On the Friday before Halloween, a ghostly artifact will go on view in New York City-a "lost" statue by Donatello, one of the most famous artists of the Renaissance.
The statue joins the list of other so-called lost Renaissance and Baroque art to surface in the past few decades, including a statue by Michelangelo and a painting by Artemisia Gentileschi, one of the few known female artists of the Baroque period. In 2011, experts even unveiled a lost painting by the original Renaissance man, Leonardo da Vinci.
These pieces weren't "lost" because they were buried underground or hidden in secret chambers. In cases like the Donatello statue and the da Vinci painting, they were already part of an art collection. Though Donatello and da Vinci were historically known to have made works that looked like these, the statue and painting themselves were thought to have been made by other artists.
So, how did experts rediscover them
"The situation of attribution in art history is chaotic," says Martin Kemp, Emeritus Research Professor in the History of Art at Oxford University. "There are no recognized protocols and different people rely upon different criteria ... The whole process of attribution is, I think, a professional mess."
Still, within this "professional mess," there are dedicated scholars who use a range of criteria-scientific, historical, and artistic-to bring Old Masters back to life.
An Original Copy
As an art expert and someone who knows quite a lot about da Vinci, Kemp says that he is "assailed with new Leonardos every day of the week, virtually." But a few years ago, he was called to examine a painting that most experts now consider to be the real thing.
Salvator Mundi, or "Savior of the World," is a painting known to have been made by da Vinci and copied by many others.
Over 20 of these copies have been identified, but, until recently, the original had never been found.
Because da Vinci's original Salvator Mundi was dirty and badly overpainted (an old restoration technique in which someone would paint over chipped areas), it was thought to be a copy when Robert Simon, president of Robert Simon Fine Art, first saw it.
As the painting was cleaned, and its true quality became visible, Simon began to suspect otherwise.
X-rays and infrared imaging revealed a remarkable clue: the artist had originally painted one of Christ's fingers in a different position, and later changed his mind and painted over it. The discovery was significant because "in all the copies of the painting, [the finger] follows the finished position," says Simon.
The revelation suggested that this was the original work that the copies were based on.
A Collection of Clues
It wasn't just the finger that convinced Simon and others that the work was an original da Vinci.
Experts performed infrared reflectology scans and scientific tests; and scholars like Kemp weighed in on the quality and history of the painting.
It wasn't any one clue, but rather the totality of evidence, that made this painting a lost-and-found Leonardo.
Other lost pieces have been discovered through a similar accumulation of clues. In 1991, experts identified Raphael's Madonna of the Pinks, formerly thought to be a copy, by using infrared reflectology and locating pentimenti (instances in which the artist changes his or her mind, as with the Salvator Mundi finger).
In the case of the Donatello statue, both X-rays and stylistic factors such as the statue's stance and wing placement have been offered as evidence.

IPL has taken ugly sledging away from cricket: Dhoni
Mahendra Singh Dhoni, India's limited-overs skipper, said Indian Premier League (IPL) has helped players from across the globe connect with each other and has taken away the "ugly sledging" from cricket. Stressing on the importance to keep the spirit of the gentleman's game alive, the Jharkhand-born cricketer was of the opinion that IPL and similar T20 leagues of the world have led to a good on-field environment in international matches.
"We play a gentleman's game. We want to win, but have to do it in the right way. IPL has taken the ugly sledging away from cricket. Friendly banter is good and that's what these Twenty20 Leagues has done. (IPL) really helped the cricketers in streamlining what was known as sledging," said Dhoni, who shared the stage with West Indies batsman Chris Gayle, said at a promotional event in New Delhi.
"I don't even interact with Indian players in IPL fearing what their team's policy might be, so I take care of all these things. But my equation with many players has improved just because of IPL," he added.
Gayle, who shares a good rapport with Dhoni, agreed with the Indian wicket-keeper batsman on IPL easing tension between players while the West Indian also mimicked the India limited-overs skipper's 'helicopter shot' on stage.
"I agree with MS about IPL. IPL has done wonders for the entire cricket fraternity. Yes, there is friendly sledging, like I enjoy with (Kieron) Pollard - Mumbai Indians player - but otherwise it's cool," said the hard-hitting opening batsman.

IUSF plans protest with participation of over 5,000
The Inter University Students Federation (IUSF) is planning to stage a protest today in Colombo with the participation of more than 5,000 students of all universities that hold the membership of IUSF along with Higher National Institutes islandwide.The protest will be staged based on a number of demands. IUSF convener Lahiru Weerasekara said the main demand would be to urge the government to abolish the privatisation of universities.
We are hoping to stage the protest against fake degrees offered at a certain institution while urging the government to abolish the private universities that are being operated at present, he said.
Questioned whether this protest is staged as a challenge to the government against the Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) student attack, he said the protest was previously planned.
However our demands include obtaining similar recognition to the HND as that of the Bachelor of Commerce degree, Weerasekera added.
The HNDA was granted equal recognition in 1990 but later a circular was issued by the Mahinda Rajapaksa government cancelling the degree status provided.
The IUSF last Friday issuing a statement condemned the manner in which the police handled the demonstration by students of HNDA where several students were injured.

Legal action against 25 ex-MPs
The Public Administration and Management Ministry has decided to take legal action against former MPs who have not vacated their official residences. Ministry Secretary J. Dadallage told the Daily News yesterday that about 25 former MPs are yet to hand over the official residences given to them. He noted that the ministry had sent notices asking them to vacate the official residences occupied by them as soon as possible.
We have informed them that legal action will be taken if they continue to overstay in these residences.
Among them are former ministers and deputy ministers as well. Some have asked to grant them further time till December to hand over these residences.
We will send letters of demand thereafter. These are luxury residences located in the heart of Colombo City such as Lauries Road, Colombo 4 and Keppetipola Mawatha, Colombo, Dadallage said.
He said the ministry has faced difficulties to provide accommodation to the new MPs as there are a limited number of official residences. Dadallage said many new MPs outside Colombo have applied for these residences.
When processing the applications, we give priority to MPs in the outstation areas. However, each and every MP is entitled to the privilege of an official residence, he said.
It is reported that none of the new comers to Parliament have been given official residences yet. While some of the houses are still occupied by the defeated candidates, some houses have to be repaired and refurbished before handing them over to the new users.

Man who accidentally opened Berlin Wall dies at 86
GERMANY: Guenther Schabowski, the former senior East German Communist official who accidentally announced the opening of the Berlin Wall, has died aged 86, German media reported on Sunday.
Schabowski, a member of and spokesman for the Soviet bloc state's ruling Politburo, was speaking at an otherwise dull news conference on November 9, 1989, when he was asked by a journalist about current travel rules.
Pressure had been building on the East German government for months to grant its citizens the freedom to travel to the West and a clearly underprepared Schabowski stunned the journalists present with his answer.
"Therefore... um... we have decided today... um... to implement a regulation that allows every citizen of the German Democratic Republic... um... to... um... leave East Germany through any of the border crossings," Schabowski said.
He was then asked when the new rule would take effect. "According to my information... immediately, without delay," he stammered, shuffling through the papers spread in front of him as he searched in vain for clarifying information.
It later emerged the announcement was not supposed to be released until 4 a.m. the next morning. Schabowski also meant to say East Germans could apply for visas in an orderly manner at the appropriate state agency.
But his confused utterances, cast almost like an afterthought, became a political bombshell for the ages.
Journalists immediately began reporting that the Wall, long the most potent symbol of the Iron Curtain and Cold War dividing East and West, was open, spurring a mad dash by joyful East Germans for the border.
East Germany's Communist regime swiftly collapsed, free elections followed and the state itself vanished with German reunification in October 1990.

The President who arrived at the official residence of the Thailand Prime Minister was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Chan-o-cha. The welcome ceremony included a Guard of Honour.
After the welcome ceremony, the two leaders commenced bilateral talks. The discussions focused on the fields of politics and culture of the two countries. President Sirisena said a government of good governance which gives priority to democracy has now been established in Sri Lanka.
He added the aim of the new government is to take the concept of consensual politics forward.
The government is committed to strengthen the constitution at every occasion," he said.
Prime Minister Chan-o-cha said the programme of the new government of Sri Lanka is exemplary to the entire world.
The Sri Lankan Presidents visit to Thailand is a significant occasion to our country, Prime Minister Chan-o-cha added.
The Prime Minister of Thailand pointed out that all countries should work with consensus to prevent political problems between countries.
President Sirisena made a special request to the Prime Minister of Thailand to support Sri Lanka in technological and research work.
The Prime Minister expressed his agreement in this regard.
Prime Minister Chan-o-cha said Thai investors are keen to invest in Sri Lanka in the fields of mineral oil, fishing and health.
He added a group of investors will come to Sri Lanka in the near future to explore possibility for investment.
Attention was also paid on the decline of the number of Thai tourists to Sri Lanka, compared to the Sri Lankan tourists to Thailand.
He pointed out it was due the inadequate communication given to the world about the historic heritage and cultural values of Sri Lanka.
The two leaders discussed the importance of increasing the number of flights between the two countries. The Thai Prime Minister agreed to come up with a future programme to implement a plan to increase flights. The Thai Prime Minister pointed out that as Buddhist countries the cultural ties between Sri Lanka and Thailand could help the two countries to move forward for a strong journey economically and politically.
A special commemorative stamp was launched to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Thailand.
Bi-lateral discussions between Sri Lanka and Thailand were held parallel to this meeting. Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva, Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake and Board of Investment chairman Upul Jayasuriya also partiiapted.
To celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and Thailand and parallel to the state visit, President Sirisena opened the exhibition of the Sarvagna dhathu from the Mahiyangana Rajamaha Viharaya, at the Buddhamanthan Temple last afternoon.

A New York Times Crossword Writer xplains His Craft
Unless youre the type who finishes The New York Times Sunday crossword puzzle in ink every week, you may not spend a lot of time thinking about the science behind puzzle-making. But if youre anything like us, you do occasionally guffaw at a particularly brilliant clue, or sit befuddled at a stumper, wondering idly how they come up with those things. Today, a Times crossword creator (actually they call themselves constructors) named Brendan Emmett Quigley took to Reddit to answer questions about his craft, and the result was a fascinating bunch of information in the form of a dizzyingly long message board thread. But if you pull out just the pithy answers, they make for a neat FAQ that details how such puzzles are made.
Of course, we couldnt just leave the questioning to Reddit. We had to call Quigley up to get his take on todays online exercise. I didnt have any preconceived notions for it. I thought Id give it a shot and see what happened. I was completely shocked that it skyrocketed to the front of Reddit, he said via telephone.
There are obviously crossword fans there. Quigley told us his favorite part of puzzle writing was debuting a new word before his competitors. Theres a little unspoken race among us constructors who can be the first one to get the new buzz word in there.
Since I give away puzzles on my site, Im afforded the opportunity, if something comes up today, for example, to put it in the Thursday puzzle. His least favorite part Thats a little more complicated, but fascinating:
Im not the hugest fan of cluing sometimes. It can be a bit of a drag to keep cluing the same words again and again, which unfortunately keep coming up. Theres only so many new ways to clue OLEO and OREO and AREA and that kind of thing, [but] theyre easy to work with. Thats what it boils down to.
We dont go out of the way to put OREO in there. OREO is like the cement holding the bricks together, the bricks being the real marquee entries. In order to make it work, following all the rules, we have to rely on these very trite, vowel-heavy words that are in puzzles all the time Theyre hopefully holding together MESHBASEBALLCAP and JOHNBOEHNER or some crazy new fun stuff.
But he is a fan of answering questions from Redditors. Below are some of his most interesting from todays session. Weve condensed and edited some of the Reddit questions, but Quigleys answers are verbatim:
Reddit: How do you feel about the outlook for printed media, specifically newspapers such as The New York Times Do you feel that this will impact your career in the near future Is Times puzzle editor Will Shortz a nice guy
Quigley: Crosswords are transitioning just fine digitally: Across Lite, Crossword Solver for laptops. Stand Alone for PDAs, etc. Will is a nice guy. He came to my wedding.
Reddit: How many of you crossword creators are there
Quigley: About 150 of us
Reddit: Do you start with the clues and make them fit a template or the other way around
Quigley: I come up with the theme to the puzzle first, then the grid. Clues come last.
Reddit: How do you go about filling in the words I would assume you do the longer words first, followed by theme words
Quigley: You start with the longest entries first, then you put in the entries that span the longest entries, then you work simultaneously across and down until you hit a corner.
Reddit: Is there any specific word that you love putting into crossword puzzles Either because of its difficulty level or number of vowels in it
Quigley: Not a specific word per se, but typically each grid will have what I call a marquee answer. A marquee answer can a never-before used phrase, a name in the news, a consonant-heavy answer, etc. Just sayin: The consonant-heavy answers are much harder to work with.
Reddit: What is your invovlement with Will Shortz What typical editting occurrs on a crossword
Quigley: I send him puzzles and he runs the ones he likes. If we bump into each other, we might have a beer.
Editing typically means polishing up the answer grid to get rid of any lousy entries, then tightening up the clues.
Reddit: Ive been doing New York Times crosswords since I was 16 and Im 22 now. I have never been able to complete one past Wednesday. Do you have any advice for improving my skills
Quigley: It sounds trivial, but doing it every day forces you to get better, even if you have absolutely no shot of even finishing any puzzle past Wednesday.
Its like working out, you have to tear muscle if you plan to build any. Youll find that over time youll be able to see through the tricks in the clues. Eventually, you should be able to ask yourself what newfangled clue are they using to hide the most typical banal answer We constructors do that a lot.
Reddit: What are the rules that a crossword has to obey I read some of them once, I thought: diagonal symmetry, no more than some percent black spaces, etc.
Quigley: Odd number of squares on a side, grid should have 180 degree symmetry, no more than 1/6th of the grid is black square, word count something like 78 words for a 15x, 72 words if theres no theme, no repeated words--even in the clues.
Reddit: Why those specifics
Quigley: The first crossword editor, Margaret Farrar, came up with these rules to help her sift through the slush pile faster. She felt that anything else would be too easy to make and too simple to solve. Despite all the changes that the crossword has gone through, all of her rules stuck.
Reddit: How did you get on the career path leading to your current job
Quigley: My career path entailed barely acquiring a BA at UNH, getting fired from miserable jobs in the publishing world, and slumming it in rock bands. That said, Ive been selling puzzles to The Times since 1996.
Reddit: Have you ever put secret messages into the answers to your puzzles
Quigley: Once or twice.

Is ours really an ethnic issue
Ours is not an ethnic problem between the Sinhalese and Tamils. Rather it is a problem between successive Sri Lanka governments and Tamil politicians. The problem may have started with the Sinhala-only of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956. But it became unmanageable only with the July 1983 anti Tamil riots when JR was in power. It was only after these 1983 riots that the LTTE took the upper hand, and in fact took control of Tamil affairs. I was vaguely on the Tamil side from 1956 onwards, and very strongly on the Tamil side after the July 1983 riots. But the LTTE turned out to be one of the most brutal terrorist groups in the whole world. Somewhere in 1985 or 1986, they massacred over 100 innocent pilgrims at the Sri Maha Bodhi at Anuradhapura. After that, I found that I could not continue to be a pro Tamil, though of course the massacre was carried out by Tamil terrorists and not the average moderate Tamils.
Since late 1980s, the LTTE had been exploding bombs. They sometimes carried out suicide bombs, almost twice or thrice a week. In fact four of my close relatives were killed by LTTE bombs, and one of my brothers and his wife who were working at the Central Bank then had a narrow escape.
Successive governments, starting with the JR led UNP government, the Kumaratunga-led SLFP government, the Wickremesinghe-led UNP government and finally the Rajapaksa-led UPFA government tried to have talks with the LTTE. The venues for the talks were Thimpu in Bhutan, Jaffna, various places in Thailand, Geneva and Oslo. But on each and every occasion, these talks were ultimately sabotaged by the LTTE.
Vadamarachchi Operation
The first military offensive of the Sri Lankan government against the LTTE in response to terrorist acts was in 1987 when Lalith Athulathmudali, who was then National Security Minister of the JR government, carried out what was called the Vadamarachchi Operation. This operation was halted by India. When Chandrika came to power in 1994, once again in response to LTTE terrorism she carried out an operation that resulted in a major portion of the Jaffna peninsula getting out of LTTE control and coming under government control.
Finally during Mahinda Rajapaksas UPFA government, a serious war broke out between the government and the LTTE triggered off by what came to be called the Mavil Aru incident in June 2006. For the successful conduct of this war, we have to be grateful to the three armed forces with their three chiefs, especially Sarath Fonseka, Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabhaya.
The war came to an end with the death of Prabhakaran in May 2009. Since then there have been no LTTE danger within Sri Lanka. But it is still there internationally. The so-called Tamil Diaspora in countries like Bhutan, USA, Canada, Australia and some countries in the European Union, in my opinion comprise three factions. One faction consists of LTTE who are still raising funds to fight the Sri Lankan government to get whatever they want. A second faction consists of Eelamists who are not LTTE but they are still keen on establishing an Eelam in the North and East of Sri Lanka. The third faction consists of moderate Tamils who would like to cooperate with whatever government we have in Sri Lanka, to arrive at a suitable solution to this problem, provided the Sri Lankan government is impartial, wise and decent.
This is where Mahinda Rajapaksas government failed though as I stated earlier that we have to be grateful that his government defeated the LTTE militarily within Sri Lanka. Rajapaksas government did nothing after that to give a suitable and decent political solution to the problem. In fact the end of the war was a glorious opportunity for that government to solve the political problem once and for all. That government may have pumped in a lot of money to the North and the East to build roads bridges and may be houses, schools and hospitals.
But that was material development, and nothing was done to mentally heal the wounds of the Tamils and Muslims who suffered due to both the atrocities of the LTTE and unwise and wrongful actions of successive Sri Lankan governments.
Several months after the end of our war, I went and had a chat and discussion with Ananda Sangaree. During the period of the war, of all the Tamil political leaders in the country this gentleman was the most vociferous anti LTTE figure. Almost every week there was an article by him in the local newspapers criticizing the LTTE. Sometimes he compared them to the Nazis in German prior to and during the Second World War, and in fact compared Prabhakaran to Adolf Hitler. Ananda Sangaree described how the LTTE was having concentration camps and torture chambers just as the Nazis did. But the interesting thing was that after the end of our war in May 2009, Ananda Sangaree was spectacularly silent. I found out the reason for his silence was that after the successful conclusion of the war, the government did nothing tangible to solve the political problem.
Now it is over six years since the war ended. During the past three years, whenever I asked someone as to what was going on in the North and East those who were pro Rajapaksa had one thing to say and those who were anti Rajapaksa had a different thing to say. So I decided to go to Jaffna and find out which story was correct, at least as far as the North was concerned. The rest of this article describes what I heard and found in Jaffna.
I was thinking to myself as to how best I could go to Jaffna, where exactly I could stay, how long I should stay there and so on when suddenly I had a telephone call from one of my good Tamil friends. He was one of my batchmates at the university, Dr. P. Shivanathan. He called from Jaffna to say that he could be coming to Colombo the following week, and that he would like to meet me just to have a chat. So the following week I gave him a call and met him at his flat in Kirulapone. Amongst other things I told him what I was planning to do in Jaffna. He promptly told that I could stay at his residence in Jaffna, as long as I liked. He also advised me to take the Jaffna intercity train which leaves Fort at 5.45 a.m. so that I can reach Jaffna by 12.30 noon. I did just that about a fortnight later, towards the end of June this year. By that time he was back in Jaffna and he was nice enough to come to the Jaffna railway station by 12.30 and take me to his residence in Kopay, a village just four to five kilometres away from Jaffna town. I stayed with Shiva for three nights and four days, and managed to meet and interview a good representative cross section of the Jaffna populace.
Jaffna University
Shiva did not have a car, as he was in Sri Lanka only half of every year, spending three months every year with one of his sons in Canada and another three months with another son in the USA. But there was a three-wheeler close to his residence in Kopay. I went to all the places in this wheeler. Shiva not only accompanied me to all the places, but also paid for the wheeler on every occasion.
I first went to Jaffna University and met the Dean of the Arts Faculty. We discussed matters relating to the ethnic problem, for about 45 minutes. He partly agreed with what I said, especially the nature of the problem as outlined in my opening statement in this article and also the probable origin of the problem. He also gave me some information regarding the student composition in various facilities that surprised me. He said that in the Faculty of Management and Commerce, nearly 45 percent of the students were Sinhalese, in the Science Faculty 60 percent of the students were Sinhalese, and in the Medical Faculty 25 to 30 percent were Sinhalese.
Later it occurred to me that the posting of students to the various faculties was the work of the University Grants Commission in Colombo, not the work of the Jaffna University itself. So there was nothing to be surprised about. I raised the issue of student violence, the Dean said that a good portion of student violence was due to love affairs between Sinhala girls and Sinhala boys. There were also differences between urban and village groups, both Sinhala and Tamil. I asked the Dean about political inclinations and affiliations of the students. He replied that all he knew was that there were no TNA or JVP supporters amongst the students. He then took me to the Arts Faculty Senior Common Room, where besides partaking of some tasty Vadai and tea, he introduced me to a few professors of the Arts Faculty. One of them was a former Dean of Art in Jaffna. He had studied Geography at Peradeniya, where he had graduated in 1970. Then he had been an Assistant Lecturer in Peradeniya (1970-1974), then in Kelaniya (1974-1979) and finally in Jaffna (1997-2007). He had been Dean of Arts in Jaffna from 2004 to 2007.
Amongst other things one specific timing he mentioned was that the constitution for Sri Lanka drafted by Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga and Neelan Thiruchelvam was very good. Actually if I remember right this Constitution was drafted by G.L. Peiris and Neelan Thiruchelvam on instructions of the former president. Then I was introduced to a lecturer in English Language teaching from whom I gathered that the Medical Faculty had just one lecturer who was Sinhala and it was the same in the Engineering Faculty. I was a bit disappointed, because appointment of academic staff was not the work of the UGC, but the work of the particular University itself.
Then I went to Jaffna Hindu College and met the principal. He pointed out that as far as our ethnic problem was concerned, both sides, the Sinhalese and the Tamils, were to be blamed. He said he can trust the present regime (Sirisena-Wickremesinghe) more than the former (Rajapaksa) and that he was expecting a solution to the problem soon. He also said that the 13th Amendment to the Constitution should be implemented fully - that is land powers and Police powers should be given to the Provincial Councils. He also pointed out that as far as government employment was concerned middle grade recruitment was fair by the Tamils, but in prominent All-Island services e.g. SLAS (Sri Lanka Administrative Service), SLEAS (Sri Lanka Educational Administrative Service), SLOS (Sri Lanka Overseas Service), Customs, etc, the recruitment of Tamils was very much restricted.
Discrimination against Tamils
At this point my friend Shiva intercepted and said this is because of nepotism more than discrimination against Tamils.
Then I had a chat with Shiva's three-wheeler driver. He said rich people in Jaffna got what they wanted from the Rajapaksa regime, through Douglas Devananda. Poor people like him got nothing from the Rajapaksa regime, nor are they expecting anything from the present regime.
I wanted him to introduce me to his friends. He introduced me to one of his good friends, who to my surprise happened to be an old-Royalist.
But at Royal, he had been mainly at the Royal Primary, Grade I to Grade VI (1977-1983). He had to leave Royal in 1983 due to the July 1983 anti-Tamil riots. Then he had studied at Jaffna Hindu College (1984 - 1987), then gone to India and continued his studies there (Grade IX to X, 1987-1988 up to O/Level).
Then he had come back to Jaffna Hindu College (1988), studied at Colombo Hindu College. Employed since 1994, he had worked at Lanka Bell Colombo (2005-2008). His father passed away in 2007. Subsequently, his mother had fallen seriously ill (aged 80). So he decided to be unemployed and look after his mother.
He and his mother are presently depending partly on his fathers pension which amounted to Rs. 16,700 per month. They have their own house, plenty of coconut trees in their compound, so they also sell coconuts. They possess a 160-perch paddy field, given on lease with a third of the profits given to them. They are therefore reasonably well off. He said that Douglas Devananda was into illegal sand mining and earned about Rs. 600 million. He said that during the Rajapaksa regime, a lot of work was done in the North by foreign organizations. The regime itself built only roads. He said he expects something good from the present regime.
When I dropped in at St. Johns College, Jaffna and met the Principal who happened to be a clergyman. He asked me whether I came to interview him in order to collect data for a research project. I told him that was not my purpose, and that I wanted to discuss our ethnic problem. To every question I put to him, he repeatedly said Dont put the blame on anyone. Just go to the root causes. After sometime I felt I was getting nowhere, so I gave up questioning him.

Out of the web and into the fire!
Adapted from James Dashners second book of the young adult triology, The Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials follows the success of its predecessor in a much more surefooted manner than expected.
The action picks up right where it left off in The Maze Runner. Thomas, Theresa and the other Gladers are on the run from the World Catastrophe Killzone Department aka W.C.K.D. Having escaped from their lab the teenagers find themselves in the Scorch. The outlook is beautiful but in reality this is a world ravaged by diseases and one that any being has only little hope of escaping.
Leaving the maze far behind him director Wes Ball has taken a unique approach to the sequel. Imagination is at its height in almost every scene. One beautifully captured shot shows the group making their way over a sand dune in silhouette when a distant gunshot halts and freezes them in their places. Another shot involves a zombie attack in a mall. The director has shot the scenes in such a manner that it is almost like watching a video game at play. The action is truly gripping but it is a pity that the script is not up to the standard of the action scenes. The narrative is too hollow for The Scorch Trials to truly shine through.
Minor differences
On the down side The Scorch Trials needs a better sense of developed mystery. Character relationships too need to be developed as well. Some of the characters in the tale too need to be developed for their personality to shine through.
The movie also seems to be a bit too identical to The Hunger Games series. The only minor differences here are that the characters realize only later that they are in yet another game zone.
Thomas has replaced the fiery Katniss Everdeen while W.C.K.D. is present instead of the Capitol. You even get a rather cold looking female heading the action in almost the same manner that President Snow witnessed the downfall of the competitors in The Hunger Games.
Bogus gravitas
ylan O Brien makes a significant impact as Thomas. Though he is no match for Jennifer Lawrence O Brien does well to capture the audiences attention. Thomas keeps his priorities straight by staying true to his band of younger brothers, and O'Brien grows into the role of leader without succumbing to bogus gravitas.
He's buoyant and urgent enough to hold his own in a cast full of scene-stealers, especially Thomas Brodie-Sangster's hyper-alert Newt, and Salazar's sly, sexy Brenda, who might be a better match for Thomas than his sometime soul mate, the distant and troubled Teresa.
Individual skills
The drawback here is when Minho (Ki Hong Lee), Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), Newt (Thomas Brodie-Sangster), and Frypan (Dexter Darden) are reduced to expository sounding boards for Thomas and other dialogue-heavy characters rather than capable heroes who possess individual skills necessary to the groups survival. They mostly hand around waiting for Thomas to call the next shot. Bigger and more ambitious The Scorch Trials is an exciting ride that you would not want to miss. It covers more ground that the franchises first installment. It also sets the stage for the third chapter of the series.

Over Rs.90 m allocated to construct houses for Meeriyabedda landslide victims
The government has granted Rs 90 million to construct 75 houses for those whose houses were destroyed in the Meeriyabedda landslide, said Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
The minister said the construction of the houses could be completed by January next year. He added that the funds has been directed to the Government Agent of the area.
The minister was speaking at a press conference at the Disaster Management Ministry.
Minister Yapa said the delay in construction of the houses was due to unavoidable circumstances. He added that the land to construct the houses had to be identified.
He added that due to the risky situation, the procurement of the construction materials also was a challenge.
The site of the housing project had to be changed due to the 100 day programme the minister said.
However, the money has already been allocated and if needed, more money would allocated for this purpose,he said.

Keiichi Hara ('Colorful') directed this anime version of Hinako Sugiura's original manga about the life of Edo-era painter Hokusai and his daughter, O-Ei.
As the title suggests, the protagonist of the animated film Miss Hokusai is the daughter of Katsushika Hokusai, arguably Japan's most famous artist from the late Edo period (if his name doesn't immediately ring a bell, his woodblock print The Great Wave off Kanagawa might). Adapted from the episodic manga Sarusuberi by the late Hinako Sugiura, this film adaptation, directed by Keiichi Hara (Colorful), is similarly anecdotal as it explores subjects as varied as the power of art, the search for the sublime, O-Ei Hokusai's coming-of-age as a young woman and artist in her own right and the relationship of O-Ei and her famous father with O-Nao, O-Ei's blind kid sister. Classy festival material, this gorgeously conceived feature has been touring the circuit since its release in Japan in May, with recent stops including the Annecy and Fantasia festivals.
The film opens in 1814 in the sprawling city of Edo (later renamed Tokyo), during the summer. O-Ei (voice of Anne Watanabe, daughter of actor Ken) introduces her father (Yutaka Matsushige) as a "crazy artist," a reference to his later nickname, "the old man mad about art". One day he might be painting something gigantic on 120 tatamis (a reference to Hokusai's Great Daruma, said to have been 600 feet long) and the next day draw a miniature on a grain of rice.
O-Ei lives with her father but isn't just his assistant but an established artist in her own right on which her Dad relies. In an early sequence, one of Hokusai's almost-finished commissions literally goes up in smoke and O-Ei has to work alone all through the night to "tame the dragon in the sky" -- potently visualized on-screen -- to make sure they don't miss their deadline the next day.
Western audiences might be slightly taken aback by the film's kaleidoscopic approach to narrative, with the film exploring different themes and characters in loosely connected scenes, with the only constant the presence of the title character. The film's rather matter-of-fact approach to sex might also raise some eyebrows, with Hokusai himself suggesting that his daughter's erotic tableaux aren't up to snuff because she doesn't know what she's painting; the women are decent but the men are copied from her father's work.
If some anime films also feature more painterly details in the backdrops, especially when depicting nature, what feels new here is the attention to details such as the glow of light sources, including candles and lanterns, that are warmer and more realistically detailed than usual. Occasional references to Hokusai's own works could logically be expected, some of them in gorgeous, ink drawing-like black and white, but what's more surprising is the film's richly conceived awareness of all the senses, including smell, taste (food is featured throughout; though father and daughter don't cook, they do eat), touch -- such as putting one's hand in the water of the river on a sunny day or feeling the difference on one's skin when moving from the shadow into the sunlight -- and, especially, hearing. The presence of O-Ei's kid sister, O-Nao (Shion Shimizu), who is blind and thus needs to rely more on her other senses, is largely responsible for this, with the gorgeous visuals complimented by a richly evocative soundscape.
One of the film's most gorgeously rendered and poignant interludes is a scene, reportedly not in the original manga, which features the two sisters' outing to the snow-covered countryside (the four seasons help structure the otherwise loosely connected material). O-Nao starts playing with a local boy, who realizes she can't see him, and launches snowballs into the trees, causing small avalanches to drop from the branches to the ground. The way in which the film renders how O-Nao seems to be hearing and feeling the experience is a small poetic wonder.
An episode involving a ghostly depiction of hell and another involving a religious painting in a brothel suggest not only how artworks were consumed in the Edo period but also suggests the power of art and how it relates to people's personal experiences. Artists need to transcend their own selves to try and reach for the sublime, though Hara suggests that their capacity to do just that in their art doesn't make them infallible as humans. Quite the contrary, as Hokusai is a terrible father to O-Nao, for example, seemingly embarrassed that a painter could have fathered a blind child. That an anime film can explore such complex subjects so beautifully in what's nominally an artist's biopic is a blessing in itself.

Pointless PULI
After lots of hype, ups and downs, the most expected fantasy movie has been released today. The movie has got a delayed release in Tamil Nadu, however the movie got released in USA earlier. Thanks to ATMUS for being spot-on. So how far the movie has been  Has it lived up to the hyped  Is it a kids movie  Lets see in this review
The movie is set in the backdrop of a magical kingdom, a place of supernatural powers and sorcery. The movie is all about the queen, Sridevi, and the ultimate commander, Sudeep. The Kingdom is in trouble and Vijay is the Ray of Hope who comes to the rescue. Vijay is put into trouble in various ways and he proves his mettle each time. How he saves the land forms the rest of the story.
The movie has a wonderful cast that consists of Vijay, Shrutihaasan, Hansika, Sridevi and Sudeep. But still the movie lacks the fizz. he sets also seem like stages sometimes. Art director has failed big time. Cinematography is a bit iffy. Shrutihaasan is the actual female lead and all she does was exposing her midriff and cleavage. How Vijay acted without taking his eyes from such a sexy midriff  That has to be the ultimate test for him as a warrior. If this is a childrens movie, why so much glamour is stuffed 
A very poor film for children, annoying and maddening for adults. There might be plot holes, but in this movie there is no such thing as a plot. The cast it the biggest strength and everyone acted well. But when the direction and script fails, they end up as horrible product. The visuals are the only redeeming value. It is far better for a Tamil movie. But still the sets are like school drama sets. We heard 5 costume designers worked for this movie and it was reflected in each frame. This movie is definitely not for Kids ! If you want your kids to lose their innocence take them to this world of fantasy where they can drool in the skin show of girls. - Kollywood Today

The Colombo Port City Development Project agreement will be revised shortly to rectify all its defects and tie up lose ends, International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the project would be recommenced under the revised agreement, adding that the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report on the project has also been finalised at the moment.
He noted the clause that gives the outright ownership of 20 hectares of land to the Chinese company would be removed, adding that under the revised clauses, Chinese submarines would not be allowed to enter without permission.
Senasinghe said a 'no fly zone' could not be operated as of the revised clauses of the agreement.
"These agreements which were signed under the previous regime cannot be cancelled. However, all the Clauses which are harmful to Sri Lanka have been revised. The project will be carried out in a manner that will be productive and beneficial to our country. The irregularities in project finances have also been rectified. Thereafter this agreement will not be anything more than that of an ordinary commercial agreement. The construction work will resume by the beginning of next year," he said.
The project is undertaken by the China Communication Construction Company and is an investment of about USD 1.5 billion. The project extends to about 270 hectares on a reclaimed land adjacent to the Colombo Port.

Sinai Peninsula and Islamist insurgency
EGYPT: The British Foreign Office map of the Sinai peninsula tells the story of this remote area of Egypt. Almost all of the regions deserts and mountains are marked red for advise against all travel or amber for advise against all but essential travel.
Like a besieged outpost, only the tiny perimeter encompassing the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh is marked green and considered safe enough for Britons. The ancient monastery of St Catherines, built in the sixth century at the foot of Mount Sinai, is now thought too dangerous for visitors.
Over the past four years, thousands of square miles of Sinai have slipped out of the control of the Cairo government and into the hands of a plethora of Islamist movements, including the terrorists of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).
Last year, Isil bluntly declared Sinai to be a province - or wilayat - of their supposed Islamic State. Day after day, gunmen proclaiming their loyalty to Isil fight the Egyptian army, which has responded with air strikes by helicopter gunships.
The Sinai insurgency began after the downfall of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Although Isil attracts all the attention - particularly with its claim to have destroyed a Russian airliner over Sinai on Saturday - it is actually a new player in an old conflict.
The nomadic Bedouin tribes of Sinai bitterly resent their treatment by the Cairo government, which they accuse of stealing their land and water for tourism projects and trying to stamp out their way of life.
ISIL and other violent Islamists have exploited these grievances to turn simmering Bedouin anger into a fully fledged insurgency, directed at Western visitors as much as Egyptian rulers.
The authorities have responded by turning Sharm el-Sheikh into a closely guarded enclave in a region awash with resentment and violence. - THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

Slipsand and QUIPS on the signs of the times!
English, Ingrisi or Engrish in whatever part of the world she is spoke gives class. No You all know that Ingrisi is the informal Sinhala term for the Queens lingo. Engrish, in case you are unaware, is the name for the occidental writing which appears on Japanese and Chinese signs. It is obvious that the enterprises or their ingrisi and Engrish sign writers, attempt to give a product cachet, a stamp of prestige, so to say. Yet although the result is a fundamentally English phrase it can sometimes be uproariously flawed and ambiguous.
Unlike in Sri Lanka, to the Japanese or Chinese readers, the Engrish words are meaningless since most speak English about as well as most westerners speak Chinese or Japanese. But little do they realise that some of these English translations usually have a fatal flaw. The dauntless anglophiles and monarchists will doubtless rant and rave about the assassination of the Queens English. Or as the redoubtable Professor Higgins would have been prompted to use his immortal phrase: Cold-blooded murder of the English language!
Yet what many fail to apprehend is the reality that English has had an ineradicable impact on every population from Britains former far-flung empire to the Eastern European Bloc. In the early days of computing, in the 80s, a London university tried to develop a program that was so sophisticated it could translate several thousand colloquial phrases. At the official press conference a reporter entered the English phrase: Out of sight, out of mind.
The resultant Russian was translated back to English: Invisible Idiot!
But as far as translations go people can be just as unwittingly funny as computers. Being an extensive traveller I have come across some sign board gems of English as she is wrote in diverse global locations. Despite reeling with jet-lag I have often observed and laughed like a hyaena at the very sight of them. Here are some of the more random samplings of signboard slips I have encountered on my sojourns as a voyager. Without a doubt, I have derived a vicarious pleasure from them. With malice to none heres hoping they tickle your fancy as well.
:Japan has more than its fair share of bloopers as well. I was tickled pink by these signs when I booked into a Tokyo hotel: Is forbidden to steal hotel towels please. If you are not a person to do such thing is please not to read notis. And another in the same hostelry which certainly seemed taking hospitality to suggestive extremes: You are invited to take advantage of the chambermaid. I fished out an air-conditioning information booklet in the same hotel which read: Cooles and Heates. If you want just condition of warm in your room, please control yourself. I sauntered down to the bar where the same irrepressible translator had been obviously at work. The promotional sign was emblazoned at the entrance: Special cocktails for the ladies with nuts.
When I walked into a car rental firm along with a fellow journalist and a photographer in Tokyo we were handed a standard brochure. It read: When passenger of foot heave in sight, tootle the horn. Trumpet him melodiously at first, but if he still obstacles your passage then tootle him with vigor. Still in Japan on the road to Kyushu we encountered this road sign indication a detour: Stop: Drive Sideways. Inside a Tokyo taxi was the sticker: Please fasten seatbelt to prepare for crash.
And again on the outskirts of Tokyo we walked through an industrial building looking for a washroom when we were hit by the sign: For Restrooms  Go Back Towards Your Behind. Hunting for my delayed baggage at Narita airport I did a double take when directed to a building in the terminal identified as: Luggage Disembowel. Conjuring up gruesome images of my fancy designer bags being slashed with a Samurai sword I rushed inside. I was relieved to observe my bags intact and none of their contents spilling out like eviscerated entrails.
And when in Rome it might be unsafe to follow the hackneyed adage of doing as the Roman do. Particularly with signs such as these howlers: Outside a doctors office: Specialist in women and other diseases. And in an Italian laundry: Ladies, leave your clothes here and spend the afternoon having a good time.
Tourists are checkmated to stand, stop, stare and snicker at this notice in a Czechoslovakian tour agency: Take one of our horse-driven city tours - we guarantee no miscarriages. And another in a Czech cocktail lounge: Ladies are requested not to have children in the bar.
If you happen to visit precocious Paris then you are bound to be entertained by the Francophonic interpretations of the argot across the channel. Here are a couple of classic examples of some literal Franglais translations: In a Paris hotel lift: Please leave your values at the front desk. Outside a Paris dress shop: Dresses for street walking.
Thailand too has some signs that provoke thigh-slapping laughter. There was this charmingly bewildering sign which is photographed over and over by tourists at the entrance to Wat Arun Temple in Bangkok. Please dress up politely. Do not clime the rail, Do not dangle any doll. Do not drop cigarette and waste on the floor! Or how would you have reacted to this shingle outside a Bangkok dry cleaning outlet: Drop your pants here for best results. Still, I like this advertisement for donkey rides in Thailand best. Check it out. It is so admirably asinine: Would you like to ride on your own ass

Sri Lanka in thrilling win
A masterly 59 by former skipper Tillekeratne Dilshan coupled with useful contributions from the bat of Ajantha Mendis helped Sri Lanka to beat West Indies by one wicket and go one up in the three match ODI series in a thrilling match curtailed to 26 overs per side due to rain at the R. Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka were set a revised target of 163 in 26 overs with the the Duckworth and Lewis system coming into play after West Indies reached 159 for 8 in their 26 overs.
Sri Lanka was on course for a win ,but with the dismissal of Angelo Mathews and a three wicket burst in one over by Sunil Narine saw Sri Lanka drifting towards a certain defeat losing four wickets for 13 runs at one stage. Ajantha Mendis a bowler turned batsman turned the tide of the match towards the host with an unbeaten 21 facing 20 deliveries and achieving victory with a six.
Windies were 40 for 3 in the 15th over when rain intervened, and their middle order comprising Andre Russell (41) and skipper Jason Holder 36 guided them towards their final destination 159 for 8.
Play began around 3.40 pm under lights, and Sri Lanka electing to field after winning the toss got off to a resounding start.
With conditions suitable for pace bowling Lasith Malinga opened with a maiden to Andre Fletcher.
But in the third ball of Suranga Lakmal's first over he trapped Johnson Charles lbw and Lakmal in his next over forced Marlon Samuels to cut a short ball and Tillekeratne Dilshan at backward point took a tumbling catch. Danushka Gunatileka and Shehan Jayasuriya made their ODI debut, and after five overs each bowled by Malinga and Suranga Lakmal who took the wickets of Andre Fletcher, Johnson Charles and Marlon Samuels, spin was introduced in the company of Sachitra Senanayake and Shehan Jayasuriya. In the tenth over.
With the score reading 40 for 3 after 14.3 overs a steady drizzle drove the players into their respective dressing rooms.
The persistence drizzle did not permit the covers to be taken off fully and it was a case of the ground staff covering and uncovering the playing surface from time to time.
However, after a tremendous job by the ground staff, play was possible around 8.30 pm with the overs reduced to 26 overs per side.
Shehan Jayasuriya completing his unfinished over clean bowled Jonathan Carter while cutting. But Andre Russell who displayed his batting prowess in the practice game was quickly on his strides, Russell and Darren Bravo were engaged in a 58 run stand for the fifth wicket and Andre struck a quick fire 41 facing twenty three deliveries with three fours and three sixes to uplift the tempo.
In the quest of quick runs Darren Bravo moved away from his stumps for a big hit and was bowled by Ajantha Mendis, then skipper Jason Holder hit a rapid 36 off thirteen balls with two fours and three sixes as the West indian reached 159 for 8 in 26 overs.
Suranga Lakmal who gave the early break through finished with 3 for 15 and Ajantha Mendis took 2 for 46 in his four overs.

Taylor keeps England in hunt
Sharjah: James Taylor hit a maiden half-century in his comeback match to bolster England to 222-4 at stumps on the second day of the third Test against Pakistan in Sharjah on Monday.
The 25-year-old, playing his first Test since 2012, kept Pakistan at bay with an unbeaten 74 and found an able ally in Jonny Bairstow (37 not out) as the two put on an invaluable 83 for the unbroken fifth-wicket stand at Sharjah Stadium.
That leaves England just 12 behind Pakistans first-innings total of 234 with six wickets intact as they hope to gain a decisive lead in their bid to level the three-match series.
Pakistan lead the series 1-0 after winning the second Test in Dubai while the first Test ended in a draw in Abu Dhabi.
Taylor kept England in the hunt as he survived a keen tussle between bat and ball, with Pakistans spin duo of Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar threatening to take wickets.
But Taylor, playing his first Test since his two debut Tests against South Africa three years ago, batted with resolve, using his feet and sweeping to blunt the spin.
He pushed paceman Wahab Riaz for a single to reach his first half century off 100 balls. He has so far hit six boundaries during his 141-ball fight. When Taylor walked in England were struggling at 97-3 after Alastair Cook (49) and Joe Root -- their two key batsmen -- had been dismissed. Taylor added 42 for the fourth wicket with Ian Bell (40) to steady the innings as Pakistan attacked through both pace and spin.
For Pakistan, Shah took 2-79 while Babar went wicket-less in his 25 overs and even a second new ball at 181-4 failed to dislodge the Taylor-Bairstow partnership.
- Outstanding -
I think the bowlers were outstanding to bowl Pakistan out in a day and today was a better day to bat and obviously we wanted to get as close as we can and obviously now its to try and get past them, said Bell, who had praise for Taylor.
He (Taylor) is a smart and a busy cricketer and what we saw today that he swept and used his feet and was busy and at the back end of the day he had a good partnership with Jonny.
Bell, who survived a confident caught behind appeal off Babar, was finally stumped off Shah. He hit two boundaries and a six during his three hour, 37 minute innings. Bell and Cook had steadied the innings with a 71-run stand for the second wicket.
England had added three runs to their lunch score of 87-1 when Cook fell to a soft dismissal as he pushed a Shah delivery straight into the hands of short leg fielder Azhar Ali. Cook hit four boundaries during his 119-ball knock.
England had hoped Root would supplement Bell but the fast-rising batsman fell to a loose shot off paceman Rahat Ali and was smartly snapped low to his right by wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed.
Resuming at 4-0, England lost Ali in the seventh over of the day when he miscued an aggressive shot off spinner Shoaib Malik and was caught in the slip by Younis Khan for 14.
Cook, who made an epic 263 in the drawn first Test in Abu Dhabi, looked in no trouble as he negotiated Pakistans pace-cum-spin attack with confidence and appeared set for another half-century before he fell.
Bell smashed Babar for a six early in the innings and ably supported his skipper, adding valuable runs for the second wicket partnership with Cook.

Time travel
At Serengeti, there is a sense of rightness, as if this is how it was meant to be before we came and spoilt it all
As our Land Cruiser drove down the long, winding road heading out from Serengeti towards the Ngorongoro Crater, a flash of red caught our eye. We turned our heads to find a Maasai tribesman loping effortlessly on the dusty plain beyond the road, headed God knows where, to the next village, the market, a watering hole... We watched for a long while, as his long, lithe strides gracefully ate up the distance and he disappeared into the horizon.
It is often said that going to Serengeti is like going back in time, but even sitting in Chennai, not a first-world city by a long shot, it is difficult to imagine just how far back this means. When you reach Serengeti, you realise that it means the very beginning of time. From the relentless immensity of the terrain to the very contours of the baobab tree, from the vultures that wait patiently for the lions to finish eating to the solitude of the lone hyena trudging bleakly on an endless search, or the Maasai man who simply ups and runs to get to his destination, there is a pervasive sense that this is where it all began. And that you just got off a DeLorean time machine and are watching it unfold before your eyes.
One of the things that made me catch my breath every one of the myriad times it happened was when I swept my eyes in a great arc across the panorama and saw a multitude of species in the same frame. No amount of Nat Geo quite prepares you for that - your eyes swing from dozens of elephants to a massive herd of wild buffaloes to even larger herds of wildebeest and zebras and impala and in the distance you can still see the trees under which you know two leopards are resting. There they all are, as if nothing had disturbed them since creation, as if this is how they might have been grazing when Noah set to work on his ark.
When the engine cuts out, there is complete silence. You can hear the grass rustling, the low harrumph of an elephant, a bird call out. There is a sense of rightness, as if this is how it was meant to be before we came and spoilt it all. Even as we watch, a leopard lazily stretches, sniffs the air and gracefully lopes off to stalk a lone gazelle he has spotted. The gazelle, in turn, looks up with a start, and scampers away. We watch the chase for a long while until they both vanish into the grass. We don't know if leopard won or gazelle, but either victory would be right. Because we are now in pre-lapsarian land where there is no sin, only life.
Dotting the endless plains are Maasai settlements, enkangs, circular hamlets fenced off with thorny acacia. Inside are round huts with conical roofs, built of branches webbed together and plastered with mud, grass and cow dung. The villages merge with the earth, dusty, brown and invisible, against which the Maasai in their flamboyant red, scarlet, and vermilion shuka flame out. The cattle are kept in an enclosure in the centre, and sometimes you spot a patch of cultivation nearby. This is how the first hunter-gatherers would have settled down, first sown a seed. This is where family, tribe, marriage, trade would have started. This is how we would have begun.
After centuries of trying to persuade the tribe to adopt 'civilisation', apparently scientists now recognise that the Maasai way of life comes closest to perfect coexistence with nature. The circle of life might well bring us right back to the beginning.

Turkey returns to single-party rule
TURKEY: Turks woke Monday to a country once again under single-party rule, after the Justice and Development Party regained its parliamentary majority in a surprise election sweep that strengthens the hand of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The AKP party founded by the divisive strongman, who has dominated Turkish politics for more than a decade, won 49.4 percent of the vote to secure 316 seats in the 550-member Parliament with nearly all votes counted, easily enough to form a government on its own. The result is huge personal victory for 61-year-old Erdogan, who may now be able to secure enough support for his controversial ambitions to expand his role into a powerful US-style executive presidency. The AKP lost its majority for the first time in 13 years in June, when pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) entered parliament for the first time. Growing conflict with Turkeys largest minority remains a key challenge for the new government.
Erdogan said voters had chosen unity and integrity in his first comments after the polls, although analysts said his surprise victory was largely down to mounting concern over renewed violence with Kurdish militants and a surge in bloody jihadist attacks.
Our people clearly showed in the November 1 elections that they prefer action and development to controversy, Erdogan said in a statement.
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu welcomed the result, saying there were no losers, but winners.
Speaking to thousands of people who waited for hours in the cold to hear him speak from the balcony of the AKP headquarters in the capital, the premier vowed to protect the human rights of all of Turkeys 78 million inhabitants.
You saw the dirty games played in our country, and you have changed the game, Davutoglu said.
The political landscape has changed dramatically in Turkey since June, with the country even more divided along ethnic and sectarian lines.
Analysts said it appeared voters had turned away from nationalist and Kurdish parties, after the collapse of a truce with outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in July prompted a surge in bloody attacks.
Erdogan said the result delivered an important message for the PKK: oppression and bloodshed can not coexist with democracy.
Support has also fallen for the HDP, which some accuse of being a front for the rebels, with Sundays vote seeing the party only just managing to scrape past the electoral threshold of 10 percent to stay in parliament.
But critics say Erdogan capitalised on public fear to regain a majority.
Erdogan rode the wave of violence back to power, said Aykan Erdemir of the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and a former Turkish opposition MP.
Underscoring one of the key challenges ahead for a new AKP administration -- the state of the Kurdish peace process -- clashes erupted briefly between police and protesters in the main Kurdish city of Diyarbakir.
HDP leader Selahattin Demirtas said it was not a fair election after his party halted campaigning in the wake of the Islamic State group attacks that targeted pro-Kurdish activists.
But its still a big victory, we have lost one million votes but we have stood tall against this policy of massacres and fascism, he said, vowing to continue to the faltering push for peace between Ankara and PKK rebels.
The threat of further jihadist violence also overshadowed the poll after a string of attacks blamed on IS jihadists, including twin suicide bombings at an Ankara peace rally last month that killed 102 people -- the bloodiest in Turkeys modern history.
During the election campaign, Erdogan declared that only he and Davutoglu could guarantee security, criss-crossing the country with the message: Its me or chaos.
The main opposition Republican Peoples Party (CHP) scored about 25.4 percent of the vote, similar to its June result.

Two committees to probe baton charge on HNDA students
Two top level committees, one appointed by the Prime Minister and the other by the National Police Commission (NPC), will conduct separate probes into last Thursdays police assault on protesting Higher National Diploma in Accountancy (HNDA) students.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe appointed a special committee headed by Dr. B.M.S. Batagoda to probe the attack. The committee will function independently from the three member committee appointed by the NPC to probe into the same matter.
While the Police Commission will investigate into the conduct of the Police, the Prime Ministers commission will look into the broader issue. It will also propose recommendations to resolve the problem, a senior government spokesman told the Daily News yesterday.
The Prime Minister appointed the commission following a special discussion on Monday morning. Names of the other members of the commission are yet to be announced.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also held a discussion with Public Order Minister Thilak Marapana over the same issue.
The Prime Minister has also instructed the minister to call for a report on the Police attack on university students.
Minister Marapana is scheduled to make a special statement in Parliament today over the police attack. Meanwhile, NCP officials who questioned Acting IGP cum Western Province Senior DIG Pujith Jayasundara and Colombo District DIG Gamini Mathurata over the incident yesterday, decided to appoint a three member committee to investigate the incident.
The NPC which has powers to entertain and investigate public complaints against police officers or the police force from the public or any aggrieved parties had decided to conduct a probe following several complaints including that of the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse students during Thursdays protest by HNDA students opposite the University Grants Commission (UGC) office in Colombo. Seven students and a police constable were injured during the clash.
Police spokesman ASP Ruwan Gunasekara said the police used minimum force as the students disrupted the peace and obstructed the police personnel from maintaining law and order.
However images of police officers baton charging the students went viral in the media generating heavy criticism and condemnation of the police action.

US Speaker wont work with Obama on immigration
US: Fresh off his election as Speaker of the House of Representatives, US Congressman Paul Ryan refused to cooperate with President Barack Obama on immigration, ruling out any reform before 2017.
You cannot trust this president on this issue, Ryan said on CNNs State of the Union.
The lawmaker made the rounds on Americas Sunday morning talk shows, following a vote that swept him into the most powerful job in Congress on Thursday.
The 45-year-old Republican made it clear that he would not negotiate with the Democratic president.
Obama, whose term ends in January 2017, sidestepped gridlock in Congress on immigration by signing a number of executive orders on the topic since the end of last year.
I think it would be a ridiculous notion to try and work on an issue like this with a president we simply cannot trust on this issue, Ryan told CBSs Face the Nation.
He tried to go it alone, circumventing the legislative process with his executive orders.
Obama had made immigration reform a campaign promise in 2008, but he focused on other priorities early on in his administration and his recent efforts have been hampered by a Republican-dominated Congress.
Obamas executive orders have given approximately five million immigrants in the country illegally a path to legal status.
Those measures include allowing parents of US citizens or permanent residents to seek a three-year work permit if they have been in the country since the start of 2010.
The topic of immigration has figured prominently on the campaign trail for the 2016 US presidential election.
Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has promised that he will expel immigrants who are in the United States illegally and build a wall on the US-Mexico border if he is elected.
Some 11 million people, mostly from Mexico, are thought to live and work in the United States illegally.

Why Americans love the Duchess of Cambridge
Americans cant imagine why anyone wouldnt want a middle-class commoner  one of us, rather than one of them  for a queen, writes Erin Moore
The Duchess of Cambridge is now so happily ensconced in the heart of the British royal family, so beloved by practically everyone, that it is possible to forget how snobs once revelled in the knowledge that her mother had worked as a flight attendant.
Though Catherine and her solidly middle-class family had always appeared impeccable  her mother, in particular  Prince Williams aides had to dismiss rumours that the princes friends used to intone Doors to manual in Kates presence.
Class warfare supposedly died out years ago in the UK. Back in 1997, former Labour MP John Prescott (now Lord Prescott) famously declared: Were all middle class now. But dont you believe it.
As cultural commentator Peter York has said, although everywhere has a class system, its our obsession, in the sense that race is the American obsession.
A majority of both Americans and British people describe themselves as middle class. However, it doesnt mean that Americans and the British are thinking the same way.
In America, the middle class is more an economic category than a state of mind, and membership is not predicated on as many complicated and specific class markers. Where Americans shop, what they buy, and how they entertain themselves are only mild predictors of whether they will identify as middle class.
The same is not true in the UK, where membership in the middle class is more dependent upon being the product of specific types of families and schools, and the shared tastes that one develops as a result.
The British middle class likes to make fun of itself, and comes in for a lot of mocking, both good-natured and otherwise, from other classes. Here, making fun of the middles is a national sport. Americans are far more serious  and sentimental  about theirs. Why It all comes down to social mobility and self-consciousness. There is less social mobility in the UK, so the middle class is more stable and secure from generation to generation. It is seen by outsiders as quite privileged  and possibly more than a little bit smug. Because of this, its members are far less worried about losing their place in society than they are about drawing the enmity of other classes. The middle needs approval to enjoy the spoils of its position (Barbour jackets, cottages in the country, organic produce boxes, fancy cheeses, Range Rovers, Farrow & Balls 20 shades of white paint), so they mustnt ruin it for themselves by boasting or appearing to strive, but instead make themselves as charming and likeable as possible.
This is achieved through self-deprecation  jokes at ones own expense. Sharp-eyed observers have noted that at one extreme, this self-deprecation can become boastful, as it shows one is so comfortable, so confident, that one can choose to appear less so. The delicate art of the humblebrag was made for the British middle class.
In America, where there is no proscription against hustle, and birth to a certain kind of family is no guarantee, people aspire very earnestly to join the middle class. Those on the inside actively fear falling out. This is a real possibility. According to a survey by Pew, the number of Americans self-identifying as lower class or lower middle class increased by 25 per cent between 2008 and 2012.
In Britain, because class is so much more than an income category, it usually takes more than one generation for a family to achieve true class mobility. A family might earn enough to place them in the middle, but lingering working-class accents and tastes can be a sign that their roots  and refusal to put on airs that would be seen through anyway  are a source of pride.
The desire of members of the English middle-class to appear less posh has even given rise to mockney a fake Cockney accent used in the Home Counties to downplay true origins and borrow some working-class cred.
