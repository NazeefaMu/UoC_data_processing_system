Smart thinking!
She is Sri Lankas pioneering woman film director of national and international repute. At 80 years Sumitra Peries says that if she were 21 today she would pursue exactly what she had chosen in life at present: a life dedicated to cinema.
Making movies is no walk in the park. However that is my passion and I would have taken the same career path even in the modern world, said the poetess of Sinhala cinema.
She was the first Sri Lankan director to shoot with one of the most advanced cameras in the modern world: the Red Epic. She shot her latest movie Vaishnavee with the camera and laid the foundation for the next generation digital cinema in Sri Lanka. This shows her willingness to put the latest technology to good use.
Sumitra says that she would not shy away from the latest technological devices even if she was more than half a century young.
The smartphone is the most revolutionary addition to the modern world. I would certainly possess one if I were 21, but would use it with the utmost responsibility. It should be used to share thoughts and connect with people not for destructive purposes, she said. She notes that she had engaged in many memorable adventures when she had been around that age in past.
I sailed on a yacht in France. It was something quite exotic then. I would repeat the process even today, she said. Sumitra notes that she has always broken away from the stereotype. She says that even today she would be different from the modern youth.
I wish to break away from the image of the average, Buddhist, middle class girl. I would have chosen Visakha College, Colombo, as my Alma Mater again because I believe it is rooted in our culture. The home I use to live in is still there. My school too has remained unchanged, Sumitra says.
She believes that she would be more of an environmentalist. Since pollution is destroying Mother Nature, she would do whatever she can to save the planet. There are a lot of things I wouldnt do today, she adds with a smile naming tuition classes, Hindi films and public display of private emotions as taboo for her.
I am against exhibiting ones personal feelings in public places. Therefore I would go to the park only to catch a breath of fresh air. Holding hands is fine but some youth go over the limit. Now Bollywood speaks in a language that I do not want to understand even at the age of 21 years today. The media has opened doors to a lot of areas for young people to communicate private feelings. This is harmful.
They need to cope with their emotions, she said. A positive thing she sees in becoming much younger is that she would get the opportunity to meet good friends who are not available by her side today. If she was many years younger, she would be able to visit them more easily.
One fact that I am sure is that I would not be the stereotype person. I would be different from the other youth. Yesterday, today or tomorrow I would be a special person who contributes to the betterment of the society. I would try to cope with the world around me and take more care in handling matters. I am thoroughly against violence. I wish to celebrate life by engaging in acts which beckons the humane side of people, she concluded.

Super Recognizer matches faces to crimes
UK: On a sticky August afternoon in 2011, as rioters looted and burned in the streets outside, a small number of police officers gathered in a room in North London.
Projected on the wall was the blurry silhouette of a man with a black woolen hat pulled deep over his forehead and a red bandanna covering all but his eyes. Security cameras across the city had tracked the man setting fire to cars, stealing from shops, beating up passers-by, even hurling gasoline bombs.
But he was always masked.
We need to identify this fellow, the sergeant said. He's one of the worst.
At that moment, Gary Collins, a constable from the local gang unit, walked in. He took one look and said, That's Stephen Prince.
Friends call Collins Rain Man or Yoda or simply The Oracle. But to Scotland Yard, London's metropolitan police force, he is known as a super recognizer. He has a special gift of facial recall powers that enables him to match even low-quality and partial imagery to a face he has seen before, on the street or in a database and possibly years earlier. The last time he had come face-to-face with Prince was during a fleeting encounter in 2005. Soft-spoken and gentle-mannered, Collins carries a baton and pepper spray, but no gun. His weapon is his memory: Facial recognition software managed to identify one suspect of the 4,000 captured by security cameras during the London riots. Collins identified 180.
Computers are no match for the super recognizers, said Detective Chief Inspector Mick Neville, head of the Central Forensic Image Team at Scotland Yard and mastermind of the squad. With its estimated 1 million security cameras, London is pioneering a new area of detection, one that could be cheaper than DNA analysis and fingerprinting and relies above all on human superpowers. Scotland Yard's ever-expanding team of 152 super recognizers is made up of men and women from across the force who score at the top end of a facial recognition test originally devised at Harvard in 2009. Collins, the star of the unit, is in the rarefied 1 percent range.
Traffic police and jailers, those patrolling neighborhoods and officers who specialize in violent crime, the super recognizers have more than tripled the number of identifications since April 2013.
They are deployed to pick out known thieves and sexual offenders in crowds of tens of thousands at rock concerts and to round up pickpockets at tourist spots like Buckingham Palace.
This year, they solved the high-profile murder of a teenage girl that had led to the mobilization 600 police officers across eight forces, the biggest search operation since the 2005 London bombings.
The term was coined in 2009 by Richard Russell, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard. He was studying prosopagnosics, or those with face blindness, and found that about 2 percent of people had a very poor ability to recognize faces.

Agreement reached over amended Vihara Devalegam Act
An agreement has been reached regarding the amended Vihara Devalegam Act in consultation with the Supreme Sangha Sabha led by the Most Ven. Tibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera, said Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijayadasa Rajapakshe.
He was speaking to the media after discussions with the Karaka Sangha Sabha led by the Malwatte Prelate at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy on October 10.
Minister Rajapakshe said the Vihara Devalegam Act formulated in 1931 had several outdated clauses.
No conclusive decision had been reached up to date although it had been a subject of discussion for the last 10 years or so, he said.
Malwatte Chapter Lekakhadhikari Ven. Pahamune Sumangala Nayaka Thera told the media that although there were problems regarding the Vihara Devalegam Act they were able to reach an agreement because these problems had been resolved.
He said although they had discussions with the former President too regarding the Bim Saviya Act they could not reach an agreement as to how it would impart on the
Vihara Devalegam Act.
But those misgivings were overcome during discussions with Justice Minister Wijayadasa Rajapaksha on October 10, he said.
Buddhasasana Ministry Secretary Vasantha Ekanayake and Buddhist Affairs Commissioner Chandraprema Gamage were also present.

Belarus President wins fifth term in landslide
BELARUS: Alexander Lukashenko won a fifth term as President of Belarus by a landslide, and warned the opposition against protests that could derail the lifting of Western sanctions imposed over rights abuse allegations.
With long-standing opposition figures barred from standing in Sunday's vote and state media giving Lukashenko uniformly positive coverage, the veteran leader ran against three virtual unknowns -- only one of whom campaigned.
Lukashenko took 83.49 percent of the vote, election chief Lidiya Yermoshina said, with his nearest rival Tatiana Korotkevich mustering just 4.42 percent of the ballot.
The result, though preliminary, is the highest ever for Lukashenko whose government made a huge effort to ensure a high turnout of over 86 percent. The process was closely watched by the European Union, with officials indicating the bloc was ready to lift sanctions against the authoritarian leader, who is regularly accused of human rights violations, if the aftermath of the polls remained incident-free.
While Lukashenko allowed an unauthorised opposition rally in the capital to go ahead without police intervention on Saturday, he warned that he would not tolerate such protests after the vote.

[Christian Perspectives]
Beyond blind faith
Who is Jesus Is Jesus God See what Jesus said about himself, his equality with God, and what exactly Jesus did to prove it.
It is impossible for us to know conclusively whether God exists and what he is like unless he takes the initiative and reveals himself.
We must scan the horizon of history to see if there is any clue to God's revelation. There is one clear clue. In an obscure village in Palestine, 2,000 years ago, a Child was born in a stable. Today the entire world is still celebrating the birth of Jesus, and for good reason.
Is Jesus God Did Jesus ever claim to be God
We're told that the common people heard him gladly. And, He taught as One who had authority, and not as their teachers of the Law.1
It soon became apparent, however, that he was making shocking and startling statements about himself. He began to identify himself as far more than a remarkable teacher or prophet. He began to say clearly that he was God. He made his identity the focal point of his teaching. The all-important question he put to those who followed him was, Who do you say I am When Peter answered and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,2 Jesus was not shocked, nor did he rebuke Peter. On the contrary, he commended him!
Jesus frequently referred to My Father, and his hearers got the full impact of his words. We are told, The Jews tried all the harder to kill him; not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God.3
On another occasion he said, I and My Father are One. Immediately the religious authorities wanted to stone him. He asked them which of his good works caused them to want to kill him. They replied, We are not stoning you for any of these but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.4
Is Jesus God
When a paralyzed man was let down through the roof wanting to be healed by him, Jesus said, Son, your sins are forgiven you. The religious leaders immediately reacted. Why does this fellow talk like that He's blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone
When Jesus was on trial for his life, the high priest put the question to him directly: Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One
I am, said Jesus. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.
The high priest tore his clothes. Why do we need any more witnesses he asked. You have heard the blasphemy.5
So close was Jesus connection with God that he equated a person's attitude to himself with the person's attitude toward God. Thus, to know him was to know God.6 To see him was to see God.7 To believe in him was to believe in God.8 To receive him was to receive God. 9 To hate him was to hate God.10 And to honor him was to honor God.11
Is Jesus God There are possible explanations.
As we face the claims of Christ, there are only four possibilities. He was either a liar, mentally ill, a legend, or the Truth.
The question is, was he telling the truth
Maybe Jesus lied when he said he was God. Perhaps he knew he was not God, but deliberately deceived his hearers to lend authority to his teaching. Few, if any, hold this position. Even those who deny his deity affirm that he was a great moral teacher. However, they fail to realize those two statements are a contradiction. Jesus could hardly be a great moral teacher if, on the most crucial point of his teaching -- his identity -- he was a deliberate liar.
Another possibility is that Jesus was sincere but self-deceived. We have a name for a person today who thinks he is God. Mentally disabled. But as we look at the life of Christ, we see no evidence of the abnormality and imbalance we find in a mentally ill person. Rather, we find the greatest composure under pressure.

The Brown Sahib legacy
In an intensely segregated society, pluralism and multiculturalism are distantly placed. Segregation of all sorts, ethno/religio/racial /linguistic and what not have a firm grip on the Sri Lankan whole and its common knowledge that the beneficiaries of this tragic phenomenon have been the politicians. Riding on the crest wave of such a divisive network, many in the very creative, self-minded political fraternity on all fronts, have installed themselves in power and built for even unborn generations, massive financial reservoirs that does not warrant any emphasis or elaboration for it is now public knowledge. Social resentment is prevalent of late than in earlier times, with seemingly no solution in the offing, as one corrupt collective is neatly replaced by some other and so goes the carnival if not the circus or still better the perahera.
Marie Musaeus Higgins
As the Britisher went about setting up his chosen, well articulated yet arguably morally deviant system worldwide, to suit his economic agenda by whipping up social divisiveness - his offspring and replica as Tarzie Vitachi called the Brown Sahib, continued from where the British left by fostering identity politics to be in power to acquire riches in their respective countries. As a result an international pecking order exists today where local and international elite collaborate to operationalize a lopsided world political economy.
Religion based schools laid the groundwork for social segregation and divisiveness followed by identity politics. Buddhist, Christian, Hindu and Muslim, schools were great facilitators into such state. The post colonial period saw the entry of foreign missionaries such as Anie Beasant, Marie Museaus, Henry Steele Olcott and the like to name a few, into colonies to establish Buddhist schools. This apart, local communities rallied round their respective community leaders as they opened up schools of their choice with the blessings of Lord Soulbury - the master craftsman of British agenda to educate their respective flock. Incidentally, he built up excellent rapport with these community leaders and convinced them of the need for religion based schools whereby the goal of bringing out a highly divisive social collective was realized.
Foreign Christian missionaries
The foreign Christian missionaries headed the Christian schools perhaps due to a shortfall among the locals to carry out such task as Christianity was at that time a new entrant to the local scene. Buddhist stalwarts like Anagarika Dharmapala, D. B. Jayatilleke and the like coupled with Tamil, Christian and Muslim leaders of that time were much to their liking for they saw in them an excellent opportunity to carve out a highly segregated Ceylonese facilitating the discreetly operative British policy of divide and rule. These leaders were unaware that they were really helping the British in fostering ethnicity, unheard of prior to alien rule despite the presence of diverse ethnic groups from time immemorial. Ironically, soul redemption was not the purpose of these educational institutions though each bore the religious tag. If that was so, the numerous Arahats and saints churned out may have been cheaper by the dozen which points out to Britain's socio/political/economic and religious agenda in initiating these schools! They certainly manoeuvred a highly divided society starting from these varied ethno/religious schools and left it to the local political elite to continue doing the needful.
Col.Henry Steele Olcott
Yet, one cannot deny their good work even though tainted by selfish motives. We see this among other things, in their fine road network they completed to facilitate tea exports if not for which we would still be travelling on cart tracks. These macadamized roads were a boon to the mercantilist economy Sri Lanka tasted for the first time though it was totally not devoid of ill effects. Vast stretches of fertile paddy land was ruined with the silt washed down in road building and forest cover clearing that paved the way for the hill country's sprawling tea plantations. The exodus of Indian labour imports to work here further segregated Ceylon's citizenry and much water flowed under the bridge before they were recognized as sons and daughters of this soil. Them being granted citizenship ended in a long drawn furore despite their relentless contribution to this country's financial coffers.
While segregation was encouraged within countries for divide and rule purposes, globally, attempts were made to bring the entire world under a common language, culture, religion. English became the international language, political and not authentic Christianity was initiated as world religion. Islam, its culture and learning, were pushed into the wilderness as the western power travelled far and wide in setting up an unbalanced system of their own.
The creation of the armed forces was to uphold the government in power never mind the corruption whereby a space existed between the rulers and the ruled resulting in greater segregation. Unspoilt village rustics donned the uniform and trained into the goose step march.
The hospital system with neatly dressed nurses and doctors facilitated the multinational drug companies.
The cake, cutlet, sandwich and patty eating, birthday celebrating elite class took the world by storm. As someone shot back at the Britisher's ulterior motives recently at such a function, I say you guys would be still in your amude (loin cloth), eating vandu aappa and playing Elle, doing caste based jobs if not for the Suddha. The recipient of the remark ran into stony silence.
Non egalitarian environment
Sinhala and Pirivena based education was neatly replaced by English, classifying locals into English educated, landed gentry that strutted like peacocks looking down on the Sinhala educated, poverty stricken classes. Wealth indeed was a passport to virtue and status.
Elitism gave rise to segregation and the birth of this bourgeoise elite - political, business and religious, paved the way for endless stratification. Nevertheless, social order was seen but at the cost of a native system being undermined for the west's benefit not to forget the accompanying social frustration that came about in a highly competitive, stratified, non egalitarian environment. While globally, a homogenous populace was their aim with common language, culture, religion, medical services, legal system, education and what not, whatever was local in the colonies was segregated, divided and rifts brought about to realize the divide and rule policy targeted towards a world economy in their favour. The al-qaeda uprising then should not surprise us. The Islamic system of governance through the caliphate ceased to be. Their banking system was folded up not to forget the social welfare measures.
The west began to speak much on the least practiced lofty ideals of human rights, egalitarianism, equality and social equity. As a result of their denying the world the intellectual and scholarly heritage of Islam, the aggressive Muslim uprising were denied the knowledge of a refined and moral confrontation of the system the west sealed worldwide which has now boomeranged on them.
Al-qaeda today knows nothing beyond the gun to fight the system thanks to the westerner! There is nothing that the west left for them of their culture and learning for these youngsters to be inspired. Even in the schools system the young minds were exposed to Percy B. Shelley, William Wordsworth, T. S. Eliot, Jane Austen, Charles Dickens and so goes the list while Muslim intellectuals, scholars, writers and poets like Jalaluddin Rumi, the mystic lady Rabia, Omar Khayyam, Hasan Al Basri, Nafeesatul Misriya, Khaleel Gibran 10th century Iranian mathematician Isfahani, the unusual combination of Botanist, Geographer and Historian Kathir Imad L Din, Astronomer and Mathematician Jabir ibn Sinan Harari - as - Sabi, Andalusian philosopher physician and intellectual Abu Bakr Muhammed ibn Tufail - al - Qayisi, Astronomer and AstrologerYahya -ibn - Galib, Seville born famous medical physician of the western Caliphate, Astronomer Hassan Abdul Rahman (903 - 986), Engineering and mechanics Musa ibn Shakir, Astronomy, Geometry, Physics and Engineering Jaffar Muhammed ibn Musa of Baghdad (800-873) Scientist Musa Ibrahim, Engineering and geometry Hassan ibn Musa (incidentally, they were the famous learned Musa Brothers of Baghdad), Mathematician Ahmed ibn Muadh al Jayyani that wrote the first treatise on spherical geometry (989 - Cordova), Mathematician Tamimi from Baghdad (980 - 1037), Geographer Yuhanna ibn Sarabiyun, scholar in Political Science, Jurisprudence, Ethics and Sociology Habib al Mawardi (not to my ears the mention of this name during my post graduate studies in Sociology at the Colombo University except of course Talcott Parson, Durkheim and other western Sociologists) among others were conveniently kept off the school curriculum, needless to mention the numerous other Muslim scientists, astronomers, mathematicians whose names were thrown overboard in Britain's attempt of homogenizing the world, Muslim resistance of which has reached saturation point as we see in the numerous anti-west Islamic organizations that have mushroomed worldwide.
Romeo and Juliet is considered the epitome of literary genius while the Quranic romance of Yusuf and Zulaiha was licensed into irreversible unworthiness.
These British originated, western backed wanton and calculated motives is ample proof of their bona fide' over their much spoken of egalitarian concept restricted only to chosen territory. If the west segregated indigenous communities it was to divide and rule and if they ever homogenized the world it was to make that rule easier. Both were to their socio, economic and political advantage.
This then is not to disown in toto the west's contribution towards social progress. For example the caste system which suppressed and denied people in the colonies upward social mobility, was uprooted and replaced by a class based society under which poverty is heavily exploited. Earlier, the monarch's tyrannical rule left no opportunity for people to rise up the social ladder. So what the richer class made of the class system is not imperialist's blame. Accountability towards the poor is the responsibility of the rich whose forebears ironically, tasted the same suffering under caste rule.
Lack of social consciousness
Economic segregation that followed from the class economy apart from ethno/religious /linguistic/political segregation, further disintegrated the population. Social frustration progressively increased. Under a class environment, the English educated, monied elite whose forebears at the very beginning were socially placed down below in the caste ladder treated those in the lower class as lesser mortals. Segregation heightened with the onset of class.
However, blaming the British alone for these irregularities would not suffice. The local leadership ought to have been creative enough to rectify the legacy of segregation by behaving more responsibly after taking over from where the British left. Instead, their choice preference was to maximize that legacy and move towards self-centredness and acquisitive tendencies. The unlimited greed for money, power and position, the disinterest in working towards social equity, competition, status consciousness and what not led the national populace into the quagmire that has come to be.
Much remains to be seen whether the minds of social, political, business and religious elite not only in Sri Lanka, worldwide as well would be emptied of opulence, greed,vanity and all that negates the higher goals for which man was created. As long as majoritarianism in local settings and the super power mania in international realms persist, all endevours into social equity is remote if not unattainable for in both these elements is clearly a lack of social consciousness. They themselves are byproducts of segregation which in turn gives rise to stratification and loss of equity. Segregation and equity certainly do not synchronize. Shared power and an all inclusive approach both internationally and locally are key elements to equity and world peace. If not, egalitarianism and equity would continue to remain only highbrow rhetoric within United Nation's confines with world peace not even a distant hope.

Cock of the walk and chicken talk!
I have never considered myself a fancy cock-of-the-walk by any standards. But my Chinese zodiac birth sign insists that I am. That is because I came squealing into this world in the Year of the Rooster. In Chinese astrology the animal signs assigned by year represent what others perceive you as being or how you present yourself.
To tell the truth, I found it agreeable to be associated with the positive characteristics of the chanticleer that marked me out as a bird of the feather. Naturally, so would you if you were branded with such head-swelling correlated attributes as conveyed in the ancient astrological chart. Which states: The Rooster can be forthright, brave, enthusiastic, loyal, tenacious, resilient, adventurous, astute, well-dressed, proficient, down-to-earth, gregarious, communicative, sensible, generous, charming, ebullient and terminally witty.
But the negative features of my alter ego described in the subsequent chapter are far from complimentary. Because just as you are floating on air with the flattering tributes ringing in your head you find yourself on the depressive down-swing of the pendulum. Although decidedly unfavourable it appears to have a neutralizing effect on your psyche when assailed by such analysis as: The Rooster can also be cranky, fussy, vain, self-involved, blindly egotistical, pretentious, high-handed, cynical, mercurial, self-absorbed and quixotic as hell.
So the jaunty cockerels are virtually in the same breath adulated and admonished in the same blasted almanac. Well, birds of a feather sometimes do flop together! When I was eight-years-old an uncle once placed an almost hatched egg under the Christmas tree. It was to be my eggs-tra ordinary gift. It was placed in a cotton-wool padded shoe box with a light bulb for warmth.
When I woke up and was enjoying opening up my presents I was delighted by the sight of a fuzzy little black chick chirping at me from a cracked shell. It turned out to be quite a chic chick and began ranging the house and large garden. Everyone was quick to call him the eggs-plorer! It was not difficult to hand-raise him. He turned out to be a bantam cockerel and I named him Bravo. The iridescent feathers of his green and red tail and wings against his black body shimmered with his cocky walk when he followed me around.
People often commented that the pet bird had an uncanny resemblance to its little owner, or was it the other way around They claimed we demonstrated the same feisty and insufferable characteristics. But to my utter annoyance they never mentioned that he was as handsome and flamboyant as they come.
The dumb clucks stressed on the likeness of the swagger, the full-throated crowing, the cockscombs and the confrontational attitude. And never mind the wicked, insinuating hints of the birds personal pleasurable proclivities they predicted I would inherit in the future. I was not amused. After all, it was inconsequential cockamamie chicken talk and humour most fowl.
Chickens may seem an odd choice for a pet, but they can be very engaging, friendly and entertaining. Contrary to popular belief they can easily be tamed and trained with food rewards. Chickens have distinct and interesting personalities. Bravo had a great soul in a little body.
Still, it takes a tough man to tame a wayward spring chicken or a rambunctious old rooster. Bravo was the epitome of the ostentatious, socially dominant strutting cockerel who strayed quite often. Everyone realised that the little rooster had soon established top social rank in the free-ranging flocks pecking order. Although the hand-raised bantam seemed to favour my companionship more than that of his own feathered kin and followed me around on my jaunts. Yet he had a tendency to disappear suddenly.
But he would always come home to roost looking a bit bedraggled with a triumphal twinkle in his beady eye. I aptly nicknamed him The Shuttlecock. Such absences were constrained by his overwhelming passion for romancing the neighbouring free-ranging hens. Bravo was a plucky little fellow and displayed his fearlessness among the domesticated roosters, many of them twice his own weight. He may have been a Bantam but he would never hesitate when taking on the ruffled heavyweights.
His cocky attitude had given him a reputation for arrogance, aggression and promiscuity. The cockfights usually took place when Bravo boldly entered their domain with one thing in mind. He was courting their jealously guarded feminine flocks. And at least five aggressive males formed an impressive phalanx to guard them from his advances. But the tough country cocks were no match for my beautifully-plumed bantam even when they ganged up on him. The feisty Bravo charged his opponents in one kamikaze onslaught after another.
Bravo usually had his way with the hens of his choice after several brief skirmishes with the ruling roosters of the flocks. He loved hanging around the chic chicks and even the old hens never even put up a token squawk when he made his concupiscent forays. All they seemed to say in chicken cackle was: Cluckety cluck, what eggs-traordinary luck! The biggest of those roosters was a coward. He was a big blustering bully. But the fact remained that he was chicken even for a chicken. As a fighting-cock, Bravo set the feathers flying and beat him into a cocked hat.
Besides, everyone thought that the hens fancied the handsome coquettish chanticleer far more than the bland coloured males of their own brood. Concerning Bravo, we may have been the cocks-of-the walk but although we did have our differences he deferred to me in the pecking order. After all, going by the old parody of sticking feathers up where Yankee-Doodle stuck his does not make you a chicken. You have got to have flair. So all you kukula types out there simply shake a tail feather and start strutting your stuff. So, Chinese astrology doesnt seem all that cockeyed as far as the positive aspects of my rooster personality are concerned. As for the negative viewpoint I would say its a whole lot of poppycock! You can be cocksure of that.

Conceptual revolution of irrigation
Late J.R. Jayewardene had a big vision for the country through Mahaweli Programme, but he was able to achieve only a part of that vision. As originally planned, the present phase of Mahaweli should be social and economic development of the families settled in Mahaweli areas by promoting food production in sustainable way to gain the return on investment on capital cost incurred on infrastructure constructed in delivering water to fertile lands in the dry zone. Unfortunately, still it is being perceived as another construction or rehabilitation project with no dynamism for economic gains or a want or desires to increase the food production.
The main drawback is that there is no positive action by the government to assist the farmers to achieve the true potential of their fields. The potential available with Mahaweli lands could easily help to bring the country to self-sufficiency in healthy foods provided it is managed with right vision. The rejuvenated Mahaweli project should be perceived as a great food production area with multiple potential. The functions of Mahaweli staff in the present context must be clearly articulated to them and they have to be given all the support that they need to make a success.
New concept
Former President J.R. Jayewardene
There is a need to introduce an approach to induce a role of Production Managers to the existing management system. For example, the term Block Manager in Mahaweli Management System was used during the construction phase in the 70s because areas have been blocked for the purpose of managing construction and settlement activities. Now the project is in the production phase. Therefore the Block Managers appointed earlier should now be named as Regional Production Manager. The very word BLOCK implies negative at the production phase.
The role of a Production Manager replacing Block Manage is completely different discipline from what was adapted during construction and human settlement phase. In the current production phase, Irrigation projects should be perceived as Food Producing Factory where water is the main raw material. Production Managers focus should be to maximize food production to cater the market needs earning profits for farmers who are the owners of the factory. In addition to water, farm labour, fertilizers etc. are other inputs. Canal systems within the project area are just Belts conveying raw materials (water) in a Typical Factory. In this perspective, unless, they are ready to accept the challenges of production engineers, the role of irrigation engineers would be similar to typical mechanics responsible for maintaining machines in a conventional factory.
In view of above observations, there is need for a paradigm shift at national level in managing irrigation projects. In the new management paradigm, the farmers would be treated as clients, not the servants at the mercy of receiving water according rigid schedules decided by irrigation management staff. In this approach, the main purpose of irrigation is to deliver water to the farm at right time in right quantity. In addition, the management objectives should be focused on producing food in healthy way, profitably without polluting the fields and ground water aquifers. Main pollutants are agro-chemicals in the irrigated agriculture. It is very pathetic to observe that main clients of irrigation projects (farmers) are now dying of various diseases caused by indiscriminate use of agro-chemicals. Therefore there is a need to minimize the damages caused to the ecosystems where these food production areas are located.
Existing management staff should either be trained or new recruitments should have Production Engineering background. Water should be perceived as the most limited input which needs to be managed with the farming community jointly. Each Production Manager could be allocated a Fixed Volume of water annually, and their performance could be measured in terms of Rupees earned for the country per Unit Volume of water, while economically upgrading a healthy lifestyle of farmers. In addition to the government salary, the staff should be compensated in the form of incentives calculated in proportionate to income generated by them from their management areas. In other countries, term used to measure their performance is a drop of water to the country. Health of the farming community is also an indicator which should be used to measure the management performance skills.
Present status
We were able to introduce some of the concepts explained in this note during 2000 to 2004 under Mahaweli Programme. Recently we tried to modernize the same concept in System B by independently arranging funds from ICTA.
However due to lack of vision of existing Mahaweli Top Level Managers, it has not yet reaped the full benefits. What I am trying to explain here was also inbuilt IFAD funded project in Iranamadu which is now in progress under funding of International Fund for Agriculture (IFAD). However our irrigation engineers, who dominate the decision making, are not very concerned of what I tried to explain above based on my past 30 years of experience in the same field. Also note that while I worked for the IFAD in a project in Azerbaijan, I was able to introduce same concepts and they are now using it successfully. I do not see any reason why we could not practice here.
What we need is a political leadership to create challenges for our irrigation water management staff.

In conversation with Jesus
The first significant moment in a Christian's life is baptism when his parents dedicate the newborn to you. Thereafter, he is nurtured, cared with love and protection and put on his feet to take the first steps toward's his life journey. The child slowly but steadily grows in his parental care. When he starts looking around at the beautiful world before him the blue heavens and birds chirping atop trees, he hears the sound of music, he is snatched. Snatched away cruelly from life.
Yes, it was the same two thousand years ago when for the first time, we are confronted with Harod ordering the persecution of baby boys from their wailing mothers in order to trap and kill you as a baby but the guardian angle guided you and earthly parents away from danger so that you will survive to preach the Word of God and shower love upon the young as the Holy Bible reveal.
Oh Lord, our Lord, your greatness is seen in all the world.
Your praises reach up to heaven it is sung by children and babies
Psalm.8
After riding thousands of cruel waves, your little helpless baby's body finally rested on a migrant shore, snatched away from his mother's clutches as she fought the waves and wind to shield him when the boat overturned to yield him to the ocean. Baby Aylan Kurdi lay on burning sand that shocked the world few days later.
And all this time you were watching from above Jesus.
Tell me why tell the world what happened. Perhaps, you sent this child of innocence as a messenger or a wake-up call to violent people who caused this tragedy. To open up their conscience, rip their heart and search for repentance.
No, Lord Jesus; it never happened. These criminals continue their massacre. They will never change and in the melee, the young are sacrificed. The escalation around the world, especially in the Mid-East in untold proportions is devastating and the least we can do is to pray for their rescue.
Can you hear me, Lord Jesus I always converse with you and often you hear what I tell you but these children The ones you love so much and rests in your beautiful heart. See what St. Mark had to say during your time:
"Some people brought children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them but the disciples scolded them. When Jesus noticed this he was angry and said to his disciples 'Let the children come to me and do not stop them because the Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. I assure that whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it'. Then he took children in his arms, placed his hands on each of them and blessed them. Mark 10,13
Or, Lord Jesus is it the sins of the parents that are upon them and pay the penalty for such crimes. Some mothers kill their newborn while others cause abortions. Fathers and elders sexually assault their little girls. They are harassed willfully to cause pain in sadistic manner as it happened to little Seya Sadwami whose gruesome sexual murder shocked not only us but the word. These monsters keep repeating over and over again vengefully with no regard to your preaching. Jesus why cannot these monsters realize their follies and turn to your Word and the Bible and be spiritually awakened.
Why dont you make it happen.
It is heart - rending to see little children put to hard labour, toil for their bread and butter when they should be playing with each other. Some starve, naked with nothing to cover them as the rain pour upon their skeletal bodies. They beg, they steal for want of food.
Why have the young to suffer when they are children of God, created and life breathed into them.
Everything is in your hands, sweet Jesus and all I am asking you is to save them from strife and Satan.

Delhi joins Sri Lanka probe into sexual favours for houses
The Sri Lanka Red Cross (SLRC) yesterday confirmed that it has launched a comprehensive investigations into the complaint against a SLRC official for soliciting a sexual bribe in return of a house granted for the war displaced families in the Northern Province, by the Indian Government.
Senior Manager for Communications and Humanitarian Diplomacy of Sri Lanka Red Cross Mahieash Johnney said the SLRC jointly with the Indian High Commission in Colombo have launched an investigation into this complaint and the investigation report is expected mid of this week.
We expect the investigation report by Tuesday or Wednesday and further action would depend on the outcome of the report, he stressed.
Johnney told the Daily News that the Society will inform the police to conduct a criminal inquiry , if evidence is found to prove the complaint.
We will definitely inform the authorities concerned to conduct an inquiry against those responsible, if evidence was found to prove the claim, he said
He said that disciplinary action will also be taken against the SLRC officer or officers, if there is sufficient evidence to prove the claim.
The Indian High Commission in Colombo and the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) have launched a joint investigation into a complaint by a war-displaced widow against a Red Cross official for soliciting sexual favours in return for houses in the Indian government-funded housing project in the countrys northern province.
As the news about the allegation reached New Delhi last week, an angry South Block took the matter extremely seriously, with Foreign Secretary S.Jaishankar immediately asking the Indian High Commission for a joint probe with the SLRCS, top sources told The Indian Express
According to sources, Indian High Commissioner Y K Sinha quickly approached the Sri Lankan foreign ministry to ensure that officials  who are being probed in Sri Lanka  do not leave the country till the probe is completed.
We dont want the accused officials to escape, so the Sri Lankan foreign ministry and their immigration authorities have been informed, an Indian official said. Another Indian diplomat said that while there was no time-frame, the probe will be conducted expeditiously and thoroughly.
India will not condone any such activity by any of the implementing partners of this project. The Government of India  through its High Commission in Colombo and the consulate in Jaffna  is conducting a joint probe along with the Sri Lankan Red Cross officials, an Indian High Commission spokesperson told The Indian Express from Colombo.
Sources said this is the first time that such a complaint had come to Indias notice, and was taken seriously since PM Modi had handed over houses to some of the war widows during his visit to Jaffna in March this year.
These women are called war widows as their husbands were either declared killed or went missing during Sri Lankas war with the LTTE, which ended in 2009.
According to a report in Sri Lankas Sunday Times, investigations were initiated after a war-displaced widow from Mulankavil lodged a complaint against one of the officials at the Kilinochchi branch of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society, saying he demanded sexual favours from her in order to approve funds for the construction of her house under the project.
The report quoted a spokesperson for the SLRCS, Mahieash Johnney, as saying that the management had called for a probe following a written complaint lodged at the Kilinochchi branch last week.
While an Indian diplomat told The Indian Express that there was only one complaint so far, SLRCS Kilinochchi branch secretary Thampu Sethupathy claimed in the Sunday Times report that he had received more than 30 written and verbal complaints regarding demands for sexual favours.
He added that, based on the sensitivity of the issue, he had forwarded 15 of these complaints to the head office in Colombo.
For the last two months we have been getting this kind of complaint from the public, particularly women. Initially, we did not consider this as a serious issue until we received some of the complaints which were very sensitive, with a similar pattern. It was thereafter that we brought this to the attention of the head office, he said. The SLRCS, along with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), is the implementing partner of India for the project. The project is funded by India and implemented through a MoU with Sri Lanka.

Transcendence
Depp lacks depth
Director Wally Pfisters sci-fi thriller Transcendence plays with a lot of smart ideas. It ponders over what the future might hold in the advanced technology scenario. The results could be both fascinating as well as terrifying.
Johnny Depp plays the role of the protagonist, Dr Will Caster. Unlike other scientists, Caster believes that human consciousness is a code that can be cracked. He has spent his life chasing the idea of creating fully functioning artificial intelligence. Supporting him in his quest is his partner in science and life, Evelyn.
The story takes a tragic turn when an anti-technology activist group guns down Caster. Just when there is no hope of getting Caster back in the picture Evelyn is struck by a brainwave. She uploads Casters mind into their work.
Caster now hold incredible powers . There are plenty of resources at his disposal. He aims to help mankind but soon ends up scaring all those around him.
This is not light stuff but beckons some heavy thinking. Unfortunately it is such a bore as well. It makes a decent movie but it could have been much more had the script writing task fallen into the right hands.
Transcendence comprises an A-list cast. It is a pity that such a seasoned cast and a talented filmmaker had gone to waste because of the script. Depp has a special challenge playing Dr Caster as a person as well as an image on the computer screen. However he cannot do much with what the script requires him to do. Humour is his main strength and he is not given any space to put it to good use. Rebecca Hall tries her best to add depth to Evelyns character. The rest of the cast too do their bit in trying to make an interesting story.
Johnny Depp as Dr Will Caster
Though big ideas are present, the movie fails when they are stringed together to make a compelling story.
The plot and structure also creates character issues. We hardly get to know the personality of the characters or relate to them. Screen writer Jack Paglen does not seem to know where to go with the storyline.
Though he has the avenues to an extraordinary story at hand Paglen chooses to focus on the relationship between Caster and his wife.
The idea behind this is to play upon the sympathy of the audience but that too fails when we realize that Evelyn is partly to blame for the turn of events.
Adding insult to injury the story takes an unexpected turn with Caster using nanotechnology to create his own army of workers who he has healed one way or the other. This adds to the silliness and baffles the audience.
Once Casters mind is uploaded into the computer the story takes a monotonous turn.
The scenes are limited to back and forth shots of Casters advanced lab, the RIFT headquarters and the FBI officers.
There is definitely room for improvement.
Backed by Depps star power, the film may aim high but misses its target.

Avant Garde vessel matter
DISSANAYAKE UNDER PROBE
D.M.S. Dissanayake, Senior Assistant Secretary in the Defence Ministry and the officer-in-charge of Civil Security, has come under investigation over the controversy surrounding the Avant Garde Maritime Services Limited.
Dissanayake was the official who wrote a letter to the Navy Commander to release the vessel containing a consignment of arms for Avant Garde Maritime Services Limited. Highly placed sources from the Defence Ministry told the Daily News that the ministry would investigate whether the senior official actually had a "mandate" to issue a letter of that nature, seeking the release of the vessel. The Navy handed over an inquiry report on the matter to Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi yesterday.
After receiving the investigation report on the Avant Garde arms ship, jointly conducted by the Navy and the Coastguard, the Defence Ministry decided to initiate a comprehensive probe.
Defence Secretary Hettiarachchi yesterday confirmed that the ministry received the investigation report on the Avant Garde arms ship.
Hettiarachchi disclosed that the report has raised several serious issues related to the arms ship Avant Garde armoury which arrived in Sri Lanka from Sudan on October 5. The armory is anchored at the Port of Galle. It was taken under Navy custody and investigations were carried out allegedly due to the false information provided by the ship Captain.
The Avant Garde vessel is alleged to have brought unauthorised firearms from Sudan to the Galle Harbor. The vessel belonging to the private maritime security firm Avant Garde had reached the Galle Harbor on October 5 after leaving the main Sudanese Harbour on September 10.
Upon inspection, the Navy found that the vessel brought over 800 weapons and firearms into the country.

Faith, like love, grows day by day
His Beatitude Louis Raphael I Sako, Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans and head of the Synod of the Chaldean Church offered a meditation during morning's prayer before the resumption of the work of the Synod.
The Patriarch commented on the reading from St. Paul's epistle to the Romans, emphasising the apostle's wish to visit and bring the Gospel to the Christian community in Rome. In this way he affirmed that living the faith in communion brings consolation.
Paul is an apostle who feels that he is sent by God, he said. For him, the Gospel is an act of worship, and therefore it is praying, being in communion with God, loving, obeying, and living and bearing witness to the joy of proclaiming the Gospel in everyday life. So, one is not ashamed of the Gospel. He does not subordinate his proclamation to human opportunity or hypocritical respect, but rather considers the Gospel to be a gift of inestimable value that reveals God's justice and grace.
Faith is the basic condition for being justified and becoming children of God, as it is faith that gives meaning to life, he continued. It is not a static fact, or speculation, but rather an inner vision, a profound mystical relationship, lived in the details of difficult everyday life. Faith, like love, is a commitment and must grow day by day in the long journey of life.
On reconciling love and justice, the Patriarch remarked that if love does not exceed justice, the Gospel becomes empty. It is enough to hear of the experience of Iraqi Christians who left everything they had in one night in order to stay true to their faith.

"The opening of this building complex at the Negombo Hospital will solve those issues," he said.
"We cannot separate the health and education services provided by the Provincial Council. Every party should fulfill their responsibilities in accordance with the basic government policy. The Negombo Hospital, which was started as a dispensary in 1909, was gradually upgraded into a District General Hospital in the 1950s, considering the population growth in the province and to fulfill the requirements of the workers of the Free Trade Zone in Katunayake," the President said.

Heavy internet use puts teens at risk of high blood pressure
US: Teens who spend hours on the Internet may be at risk for high blood pressure and weight gain, researchers say.
Researchers found that teens who spent at least 14 hours a week on the Internet had elevated blood pressure. Of 134 teens described by researchers as heavy Internet users, 26 had elevated blood pressure.
This is believed to be the first study to show a link between time spent on the Internet and high blood pressure.
The findings add to growing research that has shown an association between heavy Internet use and other health risks like addiction, anxiety, depression, obesity and social isolation, researchers said.
Using the Internet is part of our daily life but it shouldnt consume us. In our study, teens considered heavy Internet users were on the Internet an average of 25 hours a week, said Andrea Cassidy-Bushrow, a researcher at Henry Fords Department of Public Health Sciences.
Its important that young people take regular breaks from their computer or smartphone, and engage in some form of physical activity. I recommend to parents they limit their childrens time at home on the Internet.
I think two hours a day, five days a week is good rule of thumb, Cassidy-Bushrow said. Researchers analysed data compiled from 335 teens ages 14-17 enrolled in the study including a blood pressure reading taken during a physical exam.
Participants also completed a 55-question survey of their Internet use during the week leading up to their physical exam. Questions ranged from how they spent their time on the Internet and their number of email addresses to time spent on the Internet daily and for what purpose.
For their study, researchers defined Internet use as visiting web sites, emailing, instant messaging, playing games, doing homework, shopping, downloading software and creating or maintaining webpages.
The study also found that teens spent on average 15 hours a week on the Internet at either school or home and 39 per cent of girls were heavy Internet users compared to 43 per cent of boys.
Researchers found that 43 per cent of heavy Internet users were considered overweight compared to 26 per cent of light Internet users.

The Film Directors Guild of Sri Lanka (FDGSL) spearheads the festival in association with the NFC as the main partner this year. Okinawa International Movie Festival and other local sponsors too have joined in to stage the event.
The festival director Ashoka Handagama and Prasanna Vithanage expressed their gratitude towards the sponsors, media and especially the filmgoers for contributing towards making the last years event a huge success.
NFC chairman Deepal Chandraratne said cinema is a massive industry and Sri Lankan cinema is now at a transition period. He said NFC came forward to motivate IFFC because of the long term benefits it can offer to local cinema.
This years theme of IFFC is Come and be enlightened. Around 100 movies that nurtured world cinema will be featured at IFFC 2015 under several categories.
IFFC 2015 program
IFFC 2015 will be launched on November 6 with the Cannes Golden Palm award winning film Deepan directed by renowned French film director Jacques Audiard.
Hosting an Asian Competition is the significance of this years IFFC. Ten highly acclaimed movies from Asia will be shortlisted to compete for this most prestigious award of the festival.
Yet another fresh section named Mosaic of Sri Lankan New Cinema Competition will be held to appreciate works of local film directors. The most cinematic movie of the year will bag the Cinema of Tomorrow award presented by the NETPAC appointed jury.
Renowned Indian and Serbian film personalities Adoor Gopalkrishnan and Emir Kusturica will be felicitated at IFFC 2015 when the IFFC team screens their movies for fans.
Over 50 globally acclaimed movies will be screened under the World Cinema section.
French film Corner will be screened for French loving movie buffs. Some of the most acclaimed French movies will be screened to the audience.
The IFFC in association with Okinawa International Movie Festival will also offer a chance for viewers to watch a host of Japanese movies.

At the closing ceremony night on November 11 Ceylon Theatres Pvt Ltd, the main theatre partner of IFFC, will felicitate four of the best Sri Lankan short movie makers with the Regal award. The winners will be offered to screen their films at Regal cinema.
Branding Colombo for IFFC
The importance of branding Colombo for the IFFC similar to the rest of the countries that host International film festivals was stressed at the press briefing.
Branding and outdoor publicity of this six-day program could be handled by a reputed Advertising agency operating in Sri Lanka under the guidance of FDGSL. The Colombo municipal council and its Mayor could offer necessary support. If finances are still a challenge FDGSL could approach the government to fulfill that need.
FDGSL and other partners of IFFC should be proactive in getting the required support of resource persons. They could have one-on-one discussions with media institution owners and newspaper editors with the objective of carrying news of IFFC in the front pages of newspapers, noted Vimukthi Jayasundara.
The media has been making a massive effort to breathe life to local cinema which was losing its magic rapidly in the past decades. The media knows the importance of an international film fest of this magnitude and what it could be offered to rejuvenate local cinema and kindle international attention.

Indian killer road creates village of widows
INDIA: For developing India, dangerous and potholed roads have long been a way of life.
But one highway running through a village in the southern state of Telangana has gained a dire reputation, blamed for the deaths of scores trying to cross it.
A bypass road of national highway 44 snakes through Peddakunta village, cutting off the community from its headquarters on the other side.
Since the road was built in 2006, Peddakunta has been dubbed the village of highway widows with only one male adult left among the huts of 35 families. The rest of the village comprises women, children and the elderly. Some 35 male residents have been killed in Peddakunta trying to reach the other side, locals say. My husband died in a bypass road accident and so did my brother and my father. There are no men to look after us in the family, Kurra Asli, 23, told AFP, holding up a faded photograph of her husband. Another widow held up a black and white printout of her dead husband, his body laying on the bypass, his left foot crushed.
Locals have demanded a foot bridge or tunnel so they can safely cross the four-lane stretch to reach the headquarters to collect monthly pensions or find employment in other villages.
India has some of the world's deadliest roads with more than 230,000 fatalities annually, ccording to the World Health Organization.

Former LTTE cadres detained at the Magazine Prison in Colombo, launched a hunger strike yesterday urging the authorities to release them.
Prisons Department sources said the detainees were refusing to take food and were staying in their cells.
Prisons Commissioner General Rohana Pushpakumara said he had met the prisoners who are on a hunger strike and discussed their issue.
According to Pushpakumara the prisoners had told him that their protest was not against the prisons administration but to get the attention of the authorities about their demand for a release.
The Commissioner General said he had asked for a written request containing the prisoners' demands while promising to hand it over to the President as requested by the prisoners. Similar hunger strikes have been reported from other prisons across the country where some ex-LTTE cadres are being held.
Meanwhile, the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) yesterday called on the government to take immediate steps to either free the prisoners or file prosecutions if they are guilty of any charges.

Mary Duff considered one of the most popular and finest female singers will be in Sri Lanka for her solo concert this month on Saturday 24 and Sunday 25 at BMICH starting at 7pm. She will be accompanied by her 6 member band, some of whom have already performed with Daniel O'Donnell last year. She will be supported by the extremely talented young Irish country singer Jordan Mogey.
Mary Duff started her singing career at the age of 12 performing with a Rock n Roll band singing hits of Bill Haley, Fat Domino and Chuck Berry. In the 80's she was asked to join Daniel O'Donnell as the supporting singer which she still does whenever he performs in any part of the world. She has done live performances in front of 60 million American viewers which speak volumes of her success as a singer. She was in the UK Top 50 with her best selling CD The ultimate collection. Her other album Voice of an Angel has given her to sing her favourite Inspirational songs. In May 2013 when she celebrated 25 years in the music industry she was awarded the Female Vocalist of the Year by the World Irish music association.
Her concert in Sri Lanka is part of an international tour covering UK, Europe and Australia. She has picked Sri Lanka for a show as she enjoyed performing here with Daniel O'Donnell in 2014. According to her, the audience in Sri Lanka was absolutely great and that it was fun performing for them. Also this becomes a rare show as she does not get time to do solo acts because of her collaboration with DOD as she tours with him most of the time. The year 2016 and 2017 will be totally engaged with Daniel touring Europe and USA and Australia.
She will be performing for approximately 3 hours and she has informed the organizer Damayantha Kuruppu of DK promotions that she will do a wide repertoire of songs covering various genres of songs endorsing why she is labeled as Singer of songs without classification.
The tickets for the 2 concerts are on sale right now and one can purchase them the Events Desk at the Hilton Poolside from 10am till 6.30pm. Since there is much enthusiasm about the concert it is recommended to buy the tickets early. For details please contact Damayantha on 0777744950.

Merkel risks all for refugees
GERMANY: There is a word for the relief many across Germany must have felt as Chancellor Angela Merkel missed out on a Nobel Prize for her stance on refugees: Schadenfreude.
The bookmakers favourite to pick up the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, Merkel lost out to a group dedicated to building democracy in Tunisia. The award saves her detractors the discomfort of seeing international honor bestowed on the chancellor for an open-door policy that is causing a storm at home, alienating political allies and a skeptical public.
Merkels approval ratings, already in decline after this years standoff with Greece, have plunged by a third since April to the lowest in almost four years. With her coalition partners openly querying her stance, Merkel looks to have lost her sure political touch, and has begun to attract comparisons with her predecessor, Gerhard Schroeder.
He also took on his party and pushed through a socially divisive overhaul that was credited with turning the German economy around, only to be voted out for his troubles.
For the first time, Merkel doesnt care about the polls, said Andrea Roemmele, a political scientist at the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin. Its about her chancellorship, its about her legacy.
Having grown into Europes dominant leader over her decade in power, Merkel is testing the limits of public acceptance by rejecting calls to seal the border and saying Germany needs to set an example. The chancellor sees no alternative, wont reverse course and accepts declining approval ratings as the price to pay, according to a person with direct knowledge of her views who asked not to be named. She is staking her political future on it, the person said.
With Volkswagen AG embroiled in an emission-cheating scandal, Deutsche Bank AG posting its biggest quarterly loss in at least a decade and German exports declining the most since 2009, Merkel also faces growing economic headwinds as she tells Germans the country can handle 800,000 or more refugees this year.
This is by far the biggest challenge during her chancellorship, said Jan Techau, director of Carnegie Europe in Brussels. Merkel clearly underestimated the pressure posed by the refugee crisis and is pursuing a policy which drives large parts of her party up the wall, he said. Shes risking a lot.
By taking a stand based on humanitarian principles, Merkel is departing from the cautious, coalition-building approach that has served her well at home and in Europe. This time, she said in an hourlong interview on national television, her call for Germans to present a friendly face to the worlds refugees comes from the heart.
The Lutheran pastors daughter also draws a parallel with the changes that swept Europe after the Cold War and dealing with the stream of refugees from war-torn countries such as Syria. Closing borders in Europe might sound like the answer, but is unrealistic  Merkel is not willing to build another wall in Europe, the person familiar with her thinking said.
Critics say Merkel is ignoring the day-to-day strains on ordinary Germans, the challenge of integrating Muslims and the risk of a political backlash in Germany, where no anti-immigrant party sits in the national parliament. Warnings have come from Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere, a Merkel confidant who is the top federal law-and-order official, and Joachim Gauck, the nations president, said the countrys ability to absorb refugees is limited. Merkels Social Democrat coalition partner is pressing her for stronger measures, including a cap on arrivals.

'Namal has no account in foreign banks'
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's spokesman Rohan Welivita yesterday said that Hambantota district Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa does not have any account in foreign banks.
Speaking on the recent allegation that a son of VVIP had a bank account in Dubai, the former President's spokesman stressed that the government can find out if there is an account in a forieng bank in favour of Namal Rajapaksa.
"It is not ethical to sling muds at the Rajapaksa family by levelling baseless allegations," he said.
He asked as to how Rajapaksa became the first in terms of preferential votes in the Hambantota district, if he was unpopular among the people.
Media reports said that the Sri Lankan government had initiated an judicial process in UAE to freeze a bank account owned by a son of a VVIP.

New traffic plan under fire
The new traffic plan introduced to lessen congestion during morning rush hours in the Colombo city was called into question by the public yesterday due to difficulties faced by them.
Heavy traffic was reported at the Rajagiriya junction, Maharagama junction and several roads leading to Colombo.
The new traffic plan was implemented yesterday between 7.30 a.m. and 8.45 a.m. to ease congestion in Colombo.
All vehicles plying from Battaramulla to Colombo were diverted to Sri Jayewardenepura Road opposite Welikada Police to the Ayurveda roundabout while vehicles leaving Colombo were diverted to Kotta Road from Borella towards Battaramulla.
Some commuters reported of being late to their work places by as much as an hour. It was reported that in Rajagiriya, pedestrians had to walk more than 300 to 400 metres for a bus halt as the halts were also shifted to a different place. People had to walk from Rajagiriya town to the parliamentary road to get a bus to travel to Colombo.
The new traffic plan introduced in several parts of Colombo became neither accessible nor reliable to the people.
The area got more congested during the peak hour even after the new traffic plan was introduced. The chaos revealed that a viable and more practical traffic system is needed to resolve the current congestion in the Colombo city, commuters told the Daily News.

"Many hundred of Tamil who were arrested on suspicion during the period of war in the North are still detained in prisons for about eight to fifteen years"
"Most of them are detained without any court action and many others whose cases are still pending for many years are suffering in prisons".
"Therefore, this Council requests His Excellency the President, Minister of Justice and the Attorney General to grant amnesty at least on humanitarian grounds and release all political prisoners who are being detained in Sri Lankan prisons even after the war coming to an end more than five years ago We would therefore implore upon your excellency, to be sympathetic towards these hapless human beings and show mercy an compassion towards them," the letter stated.

Trial against Duminda and 12 others begin
PC says he saw Duminda assaulting a woman
A Police Constable attached to the Special Task Force (STF) told Colombo High Court yesterday that he saw former MP Duminda Silva arriving at the polling centre at Rahula College, Mulleriyawa and assaulting a woman after asking three women whom they had voted for during the election.
Police Constable Damith Suranga Kumara,30, is the first witness in the case against former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva and 12 others over killing four persons including Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra.
Kumara who was on duty during the incident made this revelation before a special Trial-at-Bar comprising three High Court Judges Shiran Gunaratne, Pathmini N. Ranawaka and C.B.S. Moreis.
The witness said he saw Silva coming in a vehicle and stopping at the polling centre at Rahula College. The witness said a number of people including the former MP got off and went near the polling booth.
He then asked three women for whom they voted for and assaulted one woman, he added.
Kumara said he heard one of the women saying she was Solangarachchis wife and she voted for her husband.
Evidence was led by Senior State Counsel Thusith Mudalige and both prosecutors and defence concluded recording evidence pertaining to the first witness.

Pope Francis appeals for peace in Mideast, Africa
Pope Francis exhorted Bishops to dedicate the Terce prayer to the intention of reconciliation and peace in the Middle East, as He opened the fourth General Congregation of the 14th Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in Vatican City, last Friday.
The Pope also launched an appeal to the international community to find a way of resolving current conflicts, and urged the bishops to include in their prayer all those zones in Africa that are experiencing similar situations of conflict.
We are sorely afflicted and follow with profound concern the events in Syria, Iraq, Jerusalem and Jordan, where we are witnessing an escalation of violence that affects innocent civilians and continues to provoke a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions," the Pope said. War leads to destruction and multiplies the suffering of the population.
Hope and progress come only from the choice to pursue peace.
Let us therefore join in intense and trustful prayer to the Lord, a prayer that is intended at the same time to be an expression of closeness to our brother Patriarchs and Bishops present here who come from those regions, to their priests and faithful, and to all the inhabitants.
He urged the international community to find a way of effectively helping the interested parties, to broaden their horizons beyond immediate interests and to use the instruments of international law and diplomacy to resolve current conflicts.

Should we follow the Chinese way
As elders, we always want our children to grow up well to be good, responsible, law abiding, and useful citizens. Children are the pride of our nation. The future of our country depends on how we bring up our children. Our goal should be to promote the childrens well-being so that they could achieve their full potential to become successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors, and responsible citizens.
Sri Lankan government, at the turn of the millennium having signed a treaty at the UNICEF, undertook that all necessary steps would be taken to provide education to children compulsorily until they are 14 years. It has been revealed that in keeping with the millennium goals, Sri Lanka has miserably failed. It must be placed on record that long before UNICEF laid down such requirements, we Sri Lankans had drawn our own rules for compulsory education and had enforced such requirements effectively in the past, since 1940s thanks to the late C.W.W. Kannangara, father of free education in Sri Lanka. Our achievements had been far superior to even to countries such as Australia  because it was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam who revolutionized free education there in 1972. It is a pity our country has been dragged from riches to rags by our leaders!!
Dr. C. W. W.Kannangara
Our future descendants, no doubt, will hold us responsible. Our actions and policies had eventually carried this country to disastrous plight. We have a moral obligation towards our future generations. Scientists have proved that we would run out of our resources including water. If we continue in this fashion, sustaining the increasing population will not be possible. We should also remember that the polar ice caps and glaciers are also melting and the sea levels appear to be rising. Continuing to act irresponsibly and disregarding the duties - a moral responsibility to slow down these dangers, would be a crime against humanity. We should act now for the sake of our future generations.
Emergency laws
For the past several decades, only those in the corridor of power benefitted and they worked for their own personal gain. The ordinary country men had been simply preoccupied with the struggle for survival. Since independence the country had been mostly under the claws of emergency laws. The majority of our politicians in the past have been selfish, repressive, corrupt and undemocratic. Steps are now being taken to improve the living conditions of the masses because they had to carry the baggage too long since independence due to political incompetence. The masses now deserve a break.
I am aware the older generation, grew up in a society where there was loving kindness, humanity, patience, giving, sharing and compassion  harmlessness to all living beings. The Buddha preached us to practice good virtues (such as inner peace) etc. It may be useful to mention that the Buddha had categorized people in to four different types;
One who adopts a way of life -
* that contributes, neither to the benefit of oneself nor to the welfare of others;
* that does not contribute to ones own benefit but contributes to the benefit of others;
* that contributes to ones own benefit but not to the benefit of others; and
* that contributes to ones own benefit and the benefit of others.
Accordingly, the fourth category (the rarest species) is the most desirable group of people that should be found in larger numbers in any society. In the Kalama Sutta the Buddha has preached - greed, hatred and delusion in people cause detriment to the others - causing misery, destruction of life, steal belongings of others, and indulge in unlawful enjoyment of sensual pleasures and speak untruth.
Select Committees
We therefore need educated leaders who are truthful, committed, dedicated, honest, disciplined and most importantly virtuous, to take the country forward. The virtuous leaders are people with high ethical standards who possess a character - with trust, honesty and integrity. They could make good things happen. They are wave makers. Is it that we did not have good virtuous leaders in our country
A careful analysis of a majority of our post-colonial leaders show that they were mired in the pursuit of selfish personal goals at the expense of broader national needs or interests. In my view politics is the art or science concerned with the winning and holding control over the government. The winner guides the policies and the distribution of resources of the government. In other words, politics in Sri Lanka is the struggle for power and wealth  the use of depleted resources of the country. My desire is to show the reader that in developed countries, without even a touch of Buddhism, the majority of leaders sought the common good. They respect laws and practice moral values and do not resort to violence or self-centred, mean and prohibitive type of behaviour, causing untold misery to the citizens.
The politicians in those countries never interfered with the duties of the Police. The law too applies to everybody equally and justice is delivered in court rooms expeditiously. Laws delay are not found, which is one of the root causes for increasing rate of crimes in Sri Lanka. If so, not only rulers - parliamentarians, judiciary and the police are also responsible for dragging the country to a despicable plight. Should we set up a separate Select Committee in Parliament to recommend ways and means to improve the Parliamentarians/Parliament Secretariat, judiciary and the police If not three Select Committees This is a must.
Sri Lanka today therefore is at a critical stage since independence. The country faces a severe crisis economically, socially, culturally and politically. It has caused immense problems to the country due to endemic corruption and stupendous wastage of public funds due to bad governance. There has been instances of growth in criminal violence (which is a pointer in regard to state failure) and flawed institutions, a common feature in failed states.
Political leadership since 1970s gave priority to their own personal benefit instead of the well-being of the country and its people. Countrymen should be proud that the educated and politically mature voters used their vote as the ultimate weapon they have to change governments again and again. It is time for the President and the Prime Minister now to device methods more meaningfully to hold parliamentarians responsible even more effectively unlike in the past.
We must remember JAPAN and GERMANY had been reduced to ruins after the world war II. They were able to rise up and develop the two countries to unimaginable heights within a few decades. Why cant we Our motherland fortunately has not been reduced to wreckage and rubble after a devastating war. We have the necessary resources to uplift the country if there is a genuine effort. Sri Lanka is therefore not necessarily poor, we should say it is a less economically developed (LED) country by choice and design. We should in speed move out of poverty  to achieve status - a developing or an industrializing country.
Chinas critics
I must say that the country is now re-born after the 8th January. Our culture, economy, and sustainable development and growth needs to be given a kick-start for the future. If so, should we follow the Chinese path.
According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Phillip Alston (Australian), over 2.2 billion people are estimated by the UN to be either near or living in multidimensional poverty with over lapping deprivations in health, education and living standards. This is not an accident and he added. It is the result of a series of deliberate and conscious decisions by key actors who have chosen to prioritize other goals.
Chinas critics are not happy the way they handle public opinion. The government has been very hard and had taken steps to imprison their dissidents. They had been able to handle most of the big problems in quick speed and similar issues could have taken decades if it was done in a democracy. It is also heartening that in a period of two years China has extended pension coverage to 240 million extra rural dwellers, when in fact it exceeds far beyond the total number of the public pension system in America. The Chinese are prepared, they gladly accept and approve to put up with their system because it delivers sustainable economic growth and development. A survey had shown that 85% Chinese are very satisfied with their countries progress, when compared with the 31% of Americans.
Wang Jisi of Beijing University has observed that many developing countries that have introduced Western values and political systems are experiencing disorder and chaos. Platos prediction  live from day to day indulging the pleasure of the moment has proved prescient. Our rulers too have not only plundered and went and borrowed internationally to fill their own pockets and to give crumbs to the voters to benefit short term having neglected long term. Should not we too follow the Chinese path if we love our children

The move to co-sponsor the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka enabled the government of Sri Lanka to exhibit ownership of the suggestions in the resolution, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha De Silva said.
By co-sponsoring the resolution, we have been able to influence the content of the proposal as well, he claimed speaking at a conference on After Geneva Proposal yesterday. The move to co-sponsor was a decision taken by the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister, not a move forced on the Sri Lankan Government, De Silva claimed, adding that all political parties with moderate views including the Jathika Hela Urumaya and Tamil National Alliance (TNA) are in support of the move.
Dispelling accusations that the proposal was an attempt to meddle with the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country, the minister highlighted the resolution itself has provisions to safeguard these elements.
The minister also claimed that the government was able to avoid serious negative repercussions and economic sanctions by cooperating with the international community and winning their confidence in the current political leadership. We have been able to avoid a collapse of the economy brought on by the economic sanctions the international community was threatening to impose on us. We have successfully negated this possibility now. Agreeing Senior Lawyer J.C. Weliamuna said the UNHCR proposal was to be presented in March, where serious action was recommended against Sri Lanka with room to establish an international criminal court. The move was averted due to the change in political climate in the country paving the way for the current resolution.

Channels: Journal of the English Writers Cooperative, Sri Lanka, Volume 21-2015
Edited by Sybil Wettasinghe
Published by Adith Publishers (Pvt) Ltd
Reviewed by Aditha Dissanayake
Everyone loves stories, specially if they come with pictures. Not just any pictures but pictures created by legendary artist Sybil Wettasinghe. I am no exception. I felt I was given a rare treat when I came across Sybil Nandas drawings in a journal of short stories, non-fiction, and poetry, several decades after I read her beloved Suttara Puncha series and forgotten most but not all of the lines in, Magul Gedara Bath Natho.
Volume 21-2015, of Channels, The Journal of the English Writers Cooperative, comes with these rare gems  one-line drawings by Sybil Wettasinghe, enhancing each story and poem, making you realize this year the journal differs considerably from the usual volumes you are familiar with, which tended to have a simple pattern on the cover and was 6x9 in size.
But Channels 2015, edited by Sybil Wettasinghe is not a wholly familiar affair. You can tell this at a glance, from the size of the book and the cover photo of the nib of a fountain pen, in a background made with the letters of the Enlgish alphabet, as well as from the editors note. To me the art of creative writing is synonymous with the art of painting...
A painter selects harmonizing colors before starting to paint. In the same way, the writer should select harmonizing words that create pleasing sounds in the mind, writes Sybil Wettasinghe, and adds that throwing in a few one-line sketches is tempting, so far as it would not be at the cost of the main content, which is writing.
Credit should go to Adith Publishers too, for their excellent page layout and high quality printing which add a new flavor to this years publication.
There are 26 short stories, non-fiction and poetry here, (with three contributions from another legendary writer, Vijita Fernando: a tribute to Jean Arasanayagam, a review of Write to Reconcile II, and a short story, The Prize). Naturally, this means there are 26 different points of view and 26 creative descriptions which make it hard to describe or review them all. So, forgive me, if I fail to mention some of them in this review. As this is a collection, understandably, I might feel some stories and poems are not my cup of tea, but there is no doubt that, each piece presented here, has merit of its own. In other words, here are different arrows to pierce different hearts.
Among the stories that made indelible impressions on me was Ananda Devapriyas The Meanest Battle, which so poignantly describes how the protagonist watches his wifes battle with cancer, I was prepared to do anything, cleaning her was a part of my routine. When shall I pay you back for everything you have done for me once she told me hanging onto my shoulder, and which, in spite of the sorrow, ends in a positive note, Death is certainly a reality. However, she defeated her fear of death.
Shazla G. Hussains poem, A Special Performance too was beautifully crafted leaving the reader in suspense till the very end, thereby making the blow, when it comes, harder to bear. For those who might find some of the poems and stories are too tragic, or too cynical as I did, D.L Sirimannes Flossy the Fly and Sybil Wettasinghes Great Lover of Cats will ease the tension and bring a welcome dose of good-natured laughter.
Nobel literature laureate Alice Munro, mistress of the short form, describes a story as a world seen in a quick glancing light. Staying true to this description, from a cargo vessel on a voyage to Singapore to a grandma in Sydney recollecting her brothers marriage in Belfast, to a vegetarian dog called Billy, each of the stories collected here gives the readers a glimpse of worlds far different from their own. And just as the characters roam across the globe, so they travel in time, from mid twentieth century to contemporary Colombo. From the backs of books, smeared with tidbits of time, to the mysterious revelation of Kalu Manike on her deathbed, these stories and poems depict an abundance of creativity.
The protagonists include teenagers and ninety year olds, teachers and widows. Wars won (Stephanie Nugeras Back to Where I Belong) and loves lost (A Profound Gesture by Nanda P. Wanasundera), relationships splinter and rekindle, (Stephanie
Peries Coming Home). Whether it is the rape of the para-medical student in India ((Daughter by Sakuntala Schithanandan) or one womans lone battle with her brutal husband ((The Storm by Jassica Gunawardena), they deal with battles big and small. Everyday triumphs and tragedies are briefly illuminated, the secret places of relationships laid bare. Melancholy or mischievous, elegant or experimental  together these short stories and poems showcase the variety and vibrancy of contemporary English writing in Sri Lanka.
At a time when most publishers give short fiction step-motherly treatment, Channels 2015, with previously unpublished poems and short stories by some of the best writers working today, as well as by newcomers with great promise, is the fire that keeps the torches burning for creative writers in English, in Sri Lanka. Here is a valuable journal that reinforces the breadth and brilliance of Sri Lankan English Literature in the 21st century.
As in the previous volumes, experienced Channels veterans , Faith J. Ratnayake, Nanda. P Wanasundera, and Sakuntala Schithanandan, have returned once again to add their flair to this collection. They are joined by Nelani Goonawardena, D.L Sirimanne, Jessica Gunawardena, Lakmali Gunawardena, Shazla G. Hussain, Ananda Devapriya, Stephanie Peries, Maya Arundhati, Stephanie Nugera, Neela Gunetilleke, Sheila Gunasekara, Shireen Senadhira, Gnana Moonesinghe, Jayani Senanayake, Basil Fernando, Myrle Willimas, Chitra Premaratne-Stuiver, and Devika Berndon, whose writing styles enhance the book.
Together with the editorial board: M.T.L Ebell, Vijita Fernando, Nanda. P. Wanasundera, and the Panel of Judges: Shireen Senadhira, Chitra Premaratne-Stuiver, Yasmine Gooneratne, Sakuntala Schithanandan and Punyakante Wijenaike as well as Rajiva Wijesinghe with his Reflections after a Quarter of a Century, Channels-2015 presents an appetizing feast for readers from all over the world, to cherish.

Time to put a full stop to opportunistic politics - Vijith
The so called 'electric chair' bandied by opportunist politicians like Wimal and Gammanpila has been literally broken into smithereens by President Maithripala Sirisena by winning the confidence of the international community. They are now desperately trying to piece it together to make an attic, said Irrigation and Water Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni de Soysa.
He said the time has now come to put a full stop to this type of opportunistic politics which had no feeling towards the country. The minister made these comments to the media after calling on the Most Ven. Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at his temple in Kandy and receiving his blessings on October 9.
He said these opportunists were trying to disrupt parliamentary sitings at every turn with utter disregard to parliamentary traditions and standing orders and this was creating a bad example to the newly elected members having their debut in Parliament.
The behaviour of these MPs was unsuitable even for a death donation society, he said.
De Soysa said the newly elected MPs should strive hard to engage in disciplined politics by using the Parliament library and associating themselves with respected people in the House.
The minister said these new MPs who come from respectable families should be protected from the influence of undesirable elements and he hoped to implement a programme in this connection after consulting the President.

Trump wont be next President: Obama
US: President Barack Obama is fairly certain of one thing when it comes to next year's election: Donald Trump won't succeed him in the White House.
The billionaire businessman, the frontrunner in the race to become the Republican party's White House nominee, has raised hackles with his controversial comments on immigration, gun control and women, among other issues.
He knows how to get attention. He is, you know, the classic reality TV character, and at this early stage, it's not surprising that he's gotten a lot of attention, Obama said of Trump in an interview on CBS television's 60 Minutes news programme with Steve Kroft. I don't think he'll end up being president of the United States, Obama said in the interview, which aired on Sunday.
Trump's incendiary comments on immigration and other issues have dominated the campaign and offended many Americans, but he nevertheless has seen his poll numbers climb steadily higher. During a speech to Latino political leaders last week, Obama condemned the logic of saying clearly inflammatory things and then saying, Well that's not what I meant -- until you do it again and again. Leadership is not fanning the flames of intolerance, and then acting all surprised when a fire breaks out, he added.
Obama did not name Trump directly during that speech, instead denouncing the overall tone of the Republican presidential field.
In his 60 Minutes interview, the Democratic president pointed to genuine anti-immigrant sentiment in a large portion of at least Republican primary voters, although he stressed it was not uniform.

What To Do If you fall from good diet habits
A few people have written me recently about falling off their good habits: a relapse after months of healthy eating, or getting derailed from good habits theyve been forming like exercise or writing.
Its discouraging to fall off your diet or good habits, and you an get to a point where you dont even want to think about it.
So what to do How do you deal with a relapse
Theres no easy answer, to be honest. Ive failed and restarted a number of habits, and I now think of relapsing as just another part of the process. Were constantly learning about ourselves as we change our habits, which is the real point of habit change  its self learning, not self-improvement or self-discipline. We learn about our minds, about feelings of guilt and frustration, about coping with these feelings.
There are no easy answers, but Im going to share some things you might try:
Pause to reflect. One of the biggest problems is that when we dont even want to acknowledge our relapse. We avoid thinking about it. So the first step is to take a slight pause in your day, and reflect on where you are. You were doing great, then you slipped up. It could have been for a lot of different reasons, but just know that youre not alone, that we all slip up, and that the forces that were facing can often be too great for us at our weakest points. Thats OK. Reflect on this, and know that its not the end of the world.
Acknowledge your feelings. It can be difficult to get off track, and we can feel like failures, feel discouraged, feel frustrated with ourselves, disappointed, sad, alone, tired, angry  sometimes multiple feelings at once. Its OK to feel these things. We often try to avoid thinking about these feelings, but just for a minute, give yourself space to feel them, to really see them inside yourself, and accept these feelings as a part of your experience.
Give yourself compassion. If youre experiencing some of these difficult feelings, after acknowledging them, try giving them some love. Imagine if a friend were feeling pain  wouldnt you comfort your friend, give them a hug, listen to them, be compassionate We deserve to treat ourselves with that same love and compassion. Listen to your minds difficulties, wish for your own happiness, give yourself a virtual (or real) hug, give yourself some love. Its OK to feel these things, and its OK to wish for an end to your difficulties. zenhabits

Why are migrants in the Arctic, on bikes path leads to Europe
Bicycles used by migrants to cross into Norway from Russia are piled behind a police station on the Norwegian side of the border at Storskog.
NORWAY: Pelted by hailstones and buffeted by an icy wind, Yasser Arslanuk, a 55-year-old Syrian engineer, his wife and two young sons wobbled across the border from Russia into Norway astride bicycles last week, the latest migrants to complete an improbable new route to Europe.
This Norwegian outpost, 250 miles north of the Arctic Circle, is hardly Lampedusa, an Italian island where migrants coming on rickety boats across the Mediterranean from Libya often land, or Lesbos, a Greek island that has become the primary transit point for refugees coming by rubber raft from Turkey.
But in recent months, refugees from places like Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan have started to flow in growing numbers through Russia into the northernmost reaches of Europe, making this remote crossing an increasingly popular back door for people fleeing war and persecution or simply looking for a better life. Speaking to the European Parliament on Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited the Arctic crossing into Norway as evidence of how refugees will carve out the most mind-boggling alternatives if governments try to close off the traditional paths through southern and central Europe.
The trip, Arslanuk said after dismounting his bike and seeking shelter in a heated orange tent on the Norwegian side of the border, is better than going by sea, the hazardous option chosen by most of the more than half a million migrants who have made it to Europe so far this year.
After just a handful of migrant crossings here in the first half of this year, the number exploded in September, with 420 asylum seekers pedaling into northern Norway at Storskog, said Stein Kristian Hansen, the police superintendent in charge of the Norwegian border post. So far this week, 263 arrived via the Arctic route - a tiny number compared to the thousands arriving daily in Greece and Italy, but a record here.
Many of the arrivals, Hansen said, seemed to have little idea where they were exactly and had brought no warm clothes. But, encouraged by a flurry of reports on social media about how well Norway treats refugees, they rushed through Russia to reach Europe's northernmost frontier. It is not snowing here yet, but temperatures have already dipped close to freezing.
The next stop is the North Pole, Hansen said of the town's remoteness.
Some of them, including Arslanuk, are Russian-speaking Syrians who were already living in Russia and see the border with Norway as a path to a better life at a time when Syrian citizenship generally confers refugee status in Europe. Others, having heard of the new route into Europe, are traveling through Russia to the border rather than taking the more established but riskier paths.
A 21-year-old Syrian woman who gave only her first name, Dana, said her father, mother and brother had made it to Germany this summer through the Balkans and had sent horrific reports of their journey to Greece from Turkey. The Arctic, she decided, was easier.
Word of the Norwegian route has spread so far and fast via social media that some Syrian refugees in Lebanon are trying to get visas to Russia in hopes of getting to this Arctic border post, according to migrants with friends and family in Lebanon. For those who make it, the oddity of the route continues to the very end. A Russian ban on pedestrian traffic across the border at Storskog, and Norwegian threats to prosecute motorists who give rides to people without visas, mean that migrants, even young children and the infirm, have to use bicycles to complete the last few dozen yards of an exodus that in some cases began thousands of miles away.
Once in Russia, it costs migrants only a few hundred dollars to secure transportation to the border and a bicycle, far less than the more than $1,500 that Turkish smugglers often charge to ferry migrants across the Aegean Sea to Greece.
The bicycle-borne flow into Norway underscores not only the dogged determination of migrants but also Russia's curious role in helping to drain the population from Syria, a country that President Vladimir Putin views as a vital ally and whose leader, Bashar Assad, he is helping with bombing raids against the opposition.
Putin loves Assad and Assad loves Putin, but neither of them like Syrians, Arslanuk said, adding that he had nothing but disgust for both the government in Damascus and its armed opponents. Refugees say guards on the Russian side of the border sometimes ask Syrians why they do not return home and support Assad, but they then wave them on down a narrow road toward Norway and inform their Norwegian colleagues by telephone that another group without visas is about to arrive.
They call us blacks and just want us to leave, said Valid Jumaleizu, 35, a Syrian who worked for a time in Russia sewing clothes but could not earn enough to support his family in Aleppo and decided Europe offered better prospects.In 2014, only five people crossed the frontier here from Russia seeking asylum, said Hansen, the border police chief. So far this year, more than 600 - 78 percent of them from Syria, or at least claiming to be from there - have done so.
A booming business has grown on the Russian side of the border to help and profit from the flow. Taxis and minibuses ferry migrants from Murmansk, the northern Russian city to which most migrants heading north travel by plane or train, to Nikel, a Russian town near the border with Norway where many migrants buy their bicycles.
