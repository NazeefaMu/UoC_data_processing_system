Jesus came to heal the world
Christmas commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ many years ago. It was a beginning which will have no end. When the clock chimes at the beginning of December 25, Christians throughout the world rejoice. Churches are packed. From midnight mass till late in the evening Christians visit their respective places of worship to say Happy Birthday to their redeemer.
It could be wonderful to walk down with time, when a divine message is brought to a simple Jewish girl. Be it done to me according to your word she says, bowing her head, little realizing as to how many times she would utter these words. Yet she is worried. She was to wed a handsome wood craftsman. Young Joseph consoles her. He too had been visited by the same Messenger. They, then prepare to welcome Baby Jesus into this world.
Born in a simple shed, in an alien land, with a gentle carpenter of repute in attendance as a midwife, a couple of quadrupeds to give warmth Jesus Christ, the Redeemer of the world and Saviour was born. Visited by the shepherds and regal wise men, His mother was elated. He was the Messiah or the Promised One as said in the Old Testament. He was not an intellectual. He was born to sacrifice His life for the first sin man committed. There is no Greater Love Jesus said Than for a man to give his life for his friend. He gave his life for us. His teachings were loathed by the elite, scribes and the Pharisees. He angered them. He disagreed with their eye for an eye, tooth for tooth policy.
He humiliated them when people brought a woman in sin. Yes! The punishment in those days was stoning her to death. He that is without sin, let him cast the first stone Jesus said. Later, he found only the accused woman with him. Others had quietly walked away. When Pharisees accused His disciples of breaking the Sabbath, He had asked Which one of you will not rescue a sheep that had fallen into a well on the Sabbath. He called them the offspring of vipers, and wolves in sheeps clothing. He showed his humility by washing the feet of his disciples and when he moved with, and ate with persons whom the elite classed as the downtrodden in society.
Jesus chased vendors out of the temple. Do not make my Fathers House a den of thieves, He said. Sadly, it happens at many places of religious worship even now. Again He said which one of you will give your servant to eat before you eat It was on the dignity of labour. He spoke on child abuse Should a child be scandalized, the person should be pushed into an abyss with a stone round his neck.
That was Jesus Christ, our Redeemer. He lived for thirty three years. Preached for three years and strived to heal the world by his teaching, parables and deeds. He showed forgiveness and neighbourly love. Then, after a mockery of a trial, He trekked up Calvary carrying a heavy piece of timber to die for us and to shed his blood.
On this beautiful day, let us pray for amity, tolerance, togetherness and love in our own Motherland and around the globe.

Joy to the world!

They each have their own special treats and traditions to mark the season.

Joyeux Noel
I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. (John 8:12 NIV)
Its that time of the year again. Christians around the world including those in Sri Lanka will celebrate Christmas, which marks the birth of Son of God Jesus Christ, today. It is a joyous event that celebrates the eventful life of Jesus, whose words still ring true today, more than 2,000 years on.
This years Christmas was almost overshadowed by tumultuous political events, but sanity prevailed in the end and the previous status quo was restored. Christians and Sri Lankans from all faiths will no doubt welcome this political rapprochement that aligns well with the very spirit of Christmas. Bitter political, ethnic or other rivalries cannot take us anywhere, it is only unity that can take us forward.
Indeed, Christmas has now become a celebration that permeates communal and religious boundaries. Christmas has become a national celebration in Sri Lankas multi-ethnic, multi-religious society. People belonging to other religions actively participate in Christmas festivities and help their Christian brethren in the Christmas activities. Christmas is indeed an occasion that unites everyone across the board.
True, it has become commercialized to the extent that some children apparently believe they are celebrating the birthday of Santa Claus, that jolly character who arrives in a reindeer-driven sled from Lapland and distributes gifts to well behaved children on Christmas Eve. But looking beyond the glitter and decorations, Christmas is still a celebration of His Story. It is a story that changed the course of the world.
Christmas is all about giving and  forgiving too. It is about sharing what you have with others who are less fortunate. Jesus himself was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He was born in a manger in a common mans cottage in Bethlehem. Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. 2 Corinthians 9:7
Christmas is no doubt a joyous occasion  there is nothing wrong in celebrating it in a materialistic way, but we must also be mindful of the spiritual importance of the day. Listening to the Christmas day sermon at the Church is not good enough  one has to follow those tenets in earnest. This goes for all the religions. In fact, many experts say that todays society has become violent and crime-ridden, because people have moved away from religions and moral values. This is why it is important for temples, kovils, churches and mosques to get closer to their followers and congregations. The younger generation must be especially targeted. The religious leaders must pro-actively spread the message of peace and non-violence. Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. John 14:27
This is essential for Sri Lanka, which is still seeking lasting peace and reconciliation after three decades of discord and rancour. It is not an overnight process. Religious dignitaries and the faithful can play a bigger role in achieving reconciliation in our land. Coming to terms with the past is an essential component of this exercise. Then we will be able to learn from those experiences and rectify our mistakes. Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. (Colossians 3:13-14)
It is only through such a healing process that we can achieve lasting peace for all. In this context, we can seek solace in the core message of Jesus Christ  and Christmas  which has remained unchanged for centuries. His message is relevant today as it was 2000 years ago  Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you. John 14:17.
But peace must begin from within our hearts. Shedding evil thoughts from our minds and seeing inner beauty is essential if we are to lead pious lives. We accumulate evil thoughts including jealousy, hatred and envy in the relentless pursuit of money and material gains. We engage in sin, contravening the teachings of the Great Masters including Jesus Christ. Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin condemns any people. (Proverbs 14:34)
This Christmas should also be a day for contemplating on the never-ending rat race of life and guiding our lives in a new direction, sans wrongdoings and sins. Peace and compassion shall begin in our hearts and homes and then spread outwards. Parents have a special responsibility to ensure that their children grow up adhering to cherished religious tenets and moral values.
Christmas is not only about the birth of a Great Man, but also about celebrating his enduring legacy in a world torn apart by conflict. It is time to take His words to heart to make our world a better, peaceful place. And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. 1 Corinthians 13:13

K.M. Nelson turns 80
Good evening and a warm welcome to all friends, relatives and family of Lord K. M. Nelson fondly known to us as Nelli.
We are gathered this evening to celebrate a milestone event, the 80th Birthday of this very special person, our dear friend Neill.
When I look back on the past five decades, there is much to be said of his achievements. If I had to cover all aspects we will be here till Christmas. To keep it short and simple, his life has revolved around 3 core segments. Cricket, Maharajas and Family.
Cricket was his passion. Hailing from Ambalangoda he played cricket for Dharmasoka College. He had the privilege of captaining the team and was an outstanding bowler, being the leading wicket taker in schools that season.
Leaving school, he joined the Sri Lanka Air Force. Very soon he was entrusted with the responsibility of captaining the team. Leading from the front, they won the Division II: Donavan Andree Shield which propelled the Air Force to play in the Division I: Sara.
He was the proud recipient of the Vartharaja Award for the Most Outstanding Sportsman of the year, the first time a cricketer from the outstation received this award in the Air Force.
Having left the Air Force, he continued his cricket, playing for CCC. He could read the game well with his shrewd cricketing brain He became one of the most successful bowlers in club cricket. Year in, year out, he had a rich haul of wickets at a very economical average. It was unfortunate that the selectors never rewarded him with a National Cap. Had he been playing today, he would have made a fortune playing in the IPL.
Nelli helped CCC to win the Sara Trophy for the first time in1979 under the leadership of Michael Tissera.Nellis involvement with CCC spanned nearly 20 years as a player,coordinator and Secretary. During this time, CCC won the Sara Trophy on two occasions and many considered it the golden years of CCC Cricket.
His dedication to the game was such that he found time to serve as President of the Mercantile Cricket Association and was a member of the Cricket Board EX-Co for 15 years. He served as a National Selector for several years.He always ensured that selection was strictly on merit and his judgment never was clouded by favouritism.
Nellis career-defining moment came when he joined the Maharaja Organization where he was appointed as a Factory Manager of AF Jones Tea Exporters.
As always, he was totally committed and involved in all activities of the company. He was the catalyst around which Maharaja Cricket was built and blossomed. They were Mercantile A-Division Champions for 5 consecutive years  a rare achievement indeed.
His loyalty and commitment was soon recognized by his mentor,Mr. Rajamahendran, the Managing Director of Maharaja Organization. He was duly rewarded when he was appointed to the Board of Directors of A.F. Jones Tea Exporters.Nelli admits that he climbed the ladder of success the hard way, but attributes his position in life today largely to the wonderful support he received from Mr. Rajamahendran.
On his retirement, he was given the opportunity of operating a blending packeting company to service AF Jones Tea Exporters.
He is grateful to the valuable support he received from Jayantha Monnekulame, Sri Lal Ahangama and Rasool Deen.
The success behind Nelli was that inspirational and wonderful lady Kumudini whom he married in 1963. She was always supportive of his involvement in cricket and work.They were blessed with 3 wonderful children Minoli, Ritchi and Dennis.
In 1992, the sudden passing away of Kumudini shocked the Nelson family and friends. It was a very sad and sorrowful moment for us all.
During the difficult years to follow, Nelli played his role as a very loving and devoted father.
The death of their youngest son Dennis devastated Nelli and the family. It was a cruel blow leaving pain and suffering for all of us.
Through all these difficult moments Nelli stood like a rock to keep the rest of the family stable.
Today, we are all happy for Nelli that he has seven beautiful grandchildren who adore their Grandpa.Nelli is a legend in his own right. A straight-talking, no nonsense character who always believed in calling a spade a spade.
I have been very fortunate to have known and be associated with him for over 50 years and in the process, may have downed thousands of halves at the CCC Bar.Yes, a very loyal friend indeed who stood by me in good times and bad. Ladies and gentlemen, would you now do me the honour of being upstanding and raising your glasses to toast my dear friend on his 80th birthday. I give you Nelli!
Among the distinguished gathering were former cricketing legends Arjuna Ranatunga, Michael Tissera, Bandula Warnapura, Lalith Kaluperuma, Nirmal Hettiarachchi, Sidath Wettimuny, Roshan Mahanama, Ashley de Silva, David Heyn, Vernon Caldera, former Air Force Commander Jayalath Weerakkody, Air Commodore Gamini de Silva, Kumar Weerasuriya, Upali Seneviratne, Mahinda Seneviratne and, Chairman Nawaloka Holdings Jayantha Dharmadasa.

Parliament property damage
LEGAL ACTION AGAINST RESPONSIBLE MPs
Legal action would be instituted against Members of Parliament (MPs) who damaged Parliament property and the possibility to recover the cost of damage from them is being looked at, Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri said.
He said the Police Department awaits a report from the Chief Valuer on a final assessment of damage to Parliament property during the unruly incidents on November 14, 15 and 16 to initiate legal action.
He said a report submitted by the private company that provided the Public Address System in Parliament and another report on overall damage to public property inside the Chamber have been sent to the Chief Valuer to come up with a final assessment of the loss.
The Special Parliamentary Committee, headed by Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, that investigates into the unruly incidents in the Chamber will meet Police Department officials on Thursday.
Police investigations into the incident are being conducted by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Kumarasiri said the progress of the Police investigations would be looked into during the meeting, adding that he would chair a weekly progress review meeting into this matter. He said the Committee would request to nominate a Police officer to go through the video footages obtained from the private media institutions.
The six-member Committee appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on November 29 also includes MPs Chamal Rajapaksa, Bimal Rathnayake, Mavai Senadhiraja, Ranjith Maddumabandara and Chandrasiri Gajadheera.
We have gone through all the relevant CCTV footages of the Chamber and intend to present a report to the House naming the MPs who led the unruly incidents in Parliament. The Speaker is very keen that we produce our report as soon as possible.
The public is also questioning as to why we delay taking action against the shameful conduct of MPs, he pointed out.
Kumarasiri also observed that Parliament needs to take drastic action against the MPs who misbehaved, adding that a few weeks suspension of Parliamentary service would not serve the purpose given the severity of the offences committed. If we dont take drastic action, the MPs will continue to misbehave. The Parliament Ethics and Privileges Act has provisions to go beyond the suspension of several weeks Parliamentary service. The probe should not be unnecessarily dragged. Some are trying to do so by asking to get statements from all 225 MPs and 400 odd Parliamentary staff members. We need to finish the investigation soon and hand over the report to the Speaker, Kumarasiri added. Attacking Police personnel and MPs with water mixed with chilli powder and a wooden chair, sneaking in a knife into the Chamber, pouring water on the Speakers Chair, damaging the microphones on the Speakers table, hurling the copies of Constitution and other books at MPs, exchanging fisticuffs, hurling abuses at the Chair and conducting mock sittings were some of the indecent incidents unveiled in Parliament on November 14, 15 and 16.

Thirty-second annual congress of the Liberal Party
Liberalism is necessary to restore democracy- Secretary
Liberal Party Secretary Attorney Kamal Nissanka said that the Liberal Party does not have any memorandum of understanding with any major political party.
He was addressing their party members at the 32nd annual congress which was held at the Kurunegala Bishop Laksman Wikramasinghe Hall last Friday (21).
People of this country have a right to know what the government is doing. During the last parliamentary election, the government gave many promises about upholding human rights, but none of them were fulfilled. The Sri Lanka Liberal Party has a good and a massive vision. Liberalism is a factor which is necessary to restore democracy in the country through protection of human rights. he added.
Further he stated that the Liberal Party supported the political campaign of President Maithripala Sirisena during the last presidential election. The Secretary said that the President appoints top-post officials who are loyal to him and to the government without taking action against corruption cases which have been revealed during his reign.
The Government has failed to fulfill their tasks as they mentioned in the hundred-day programme, he added.
Chairman of the Liberal Party Anura Samarajeewa, Deputy Chairman Kethum Samaratunga, Deputy Secretary Sarath Kumarasinghe and some party members were present at the event.

The message of peace
It was peace that pervaded the atmosphere that Holy Night,
It was peace that encompassed Bethlehems plains and heights,
It was the message of peace that the angels proclaimed,
Peace on earth, goodwill to men.
Peace the hallmark of the Christ-childs birth,
Which the world celebrates with enjoyment and mirth,
The message of peace unheeded, thwarted, lies,
What a return for the Godheads supreme sacrifice.
That peace, which truly embodies the Christmas season,
Be accepted by man endowed by God with will and reason,
That the message of peace be propagated, restored, world-wide,
Peace ! The message of the Christ-child.

New Zealand seek record series win in Sri Lanka decider
CHRISTCHURCH Monday : New Zealand and Sri Lanka both have unfinished business when they head into the series-deciding second Test in Christchurch on Wednesday.
The home side have put the frustration of the drawn first Test aside as they push to win a fourth consecutive series for the first time.
Sri Lanka are equally determined to show the epic partnership by Angelo Mathews and Kusal Mendis to save the match in Wellington last week was no fluke.
We got so much confidence from that game for this game, wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella said during nets practice Monday, ahead of the Boxing Day Test on what promises to be a green wicket.
If we get some movement here our bowlers will do the job and they know what areas they must bowl at. Unlike in the subcontinent we have to bowl fuller here. New Zealand went into the two-Test series with a chance to move to number two in the world rankings if they won both Tests. That opportunity dissolved in Wellington with the heroics of Mathews and Mendis, as well as the rain which washed out most of the final day, leaving New Zealand with their next target of winning a fourth consecutive Test series. In their 88-year Test history they have won three consecutive series on only four occasions.
But having put down the West Indies, England and Pakistan over the past year, and posting 578 in their sole innings in the first Test against Sri Lanka, they sense a historic fourth is within reach.
We're very proud of our home record and I guess that's one of the challenges now, batting coach Craig McMillan said.
This is aone-off Test match and with the series on the line there's a lot for the side to play for.
The Hagley Oval wicket traditionally offers pace and bounce and both New Zealand and Sri Lanka voiced the importance of winning the toss and bowling first.
Neither side has finalised their playing XI, and while changes are unlikely, the emphasis for the fast bowlers could be less on the short-pitched deliveries New Zealand used to pound Sri Lanka with in Wellington.
New Zealand's batting hero Tom Latham, who toiled for nearly 12 hours for 264 not out in Wellington, said the Hagley Oval wicket would require a rethink from the bowlers.
There's usually a bit of pace and bounce about it and it does offer a bit for the seamers so we're going to have to adapt to these conditions as quickly as possible as well as the Sri Lankans, he said.
At least with the Basin it's a little bouncier, so it's about our bowlers realising what the right length is to hit and our batsmen adapting to a certain game plan that suits that sort of surface. The last time New Zealand and Sri Lanka played at Hagley Oval, in the 2014 Boxing Day Test, the tourists won the toss and bowled first only for New Zealand to win by eight wickets. -AFP

Platters to flatter the festive palate
The best way to spread festive cheer is by giving the people what they want: delicious food. Since Christmas is the season for giving Chef Chathurika Anuradha of Knorr fame shares some traditional as well as unique recipes and tips with us on how to prepare a Christmas menu that will satisfy even the crankiest of Christmas Grinches!
People do tend to stick to the authentic cuisine though they also like to experiment with trendy dishes. For example the roast chicken is a must on any Christmas menu. I believe that the menu should be designed according to your familys palate. You are the executive chef in your kitchen and you know about your familys preferences best. I always believe that whatever occasion you are cooking for, you need to add love to your food, Chef Chathurika said with a smile.
She notes that there is a vast selection of dishes to choose from. You get roast chicken and roast potatoes included in the Christmas menu. Then you can move onto the bakes. Sweet delicacies like the Christmas pudding will follow.
Stick to a simple but delicious range of dishes, she advised.
She says that the Christmas cake is the most traditional item in the Christmas menu. However she notes that people are buying a lot of ingredients to substitute items in the traditional Christmas cake recipe.
For example they replace almonds with cashew. They also include pumpkin preserves. The Christmas cake has taken a lot of innovative twists. Being creative is fine as long as you know the values of these authentic dishes. If you can replace certain flavours without harming the original recipe, then that is ok, she said adding that as chefs they are always trying to create new dishes and flavours to cater to the customers taste.
Rich food oozing with tantalizing flavours make it to the table during this season. Most of these are high calorie food.
Rich food pleases the tongue but at the end of the day, if you do not lead a quality life, then all the value is lost. One option you can take is to reduce the amount of sweet dishes in the menu. You do not need to add much oil. You can take options like stir frying the ingrediants. Just add a bit of oil or sugar only to get the correct textures. Also keep tabs on the quantity you need to consume. There is no way you can avoid these dishes when you are out visiting relatives or friends or dining out during this period, she said.
Since Sri Lankans consume rice as their main meal, they tend to include festive rice dishes in their menu. Roast potatoes with herbs, battered vegetables, salads and soups are popular in European countries.
She says that everything is available now at your fingertips to purchase from the market. However it is questionable whether the love that is found in home cooking is added into those dishes.
They also add a lot of artificial flavours and preservatives into these products. A lot of people tend to serve food they have purchased from outside but there is no love or commitment in those items. Nothing beats the happiness you feel when you keep in mind that you are preparing those dishes for your loved ones, Chathurika said.
She elaborates the value of convenient methods of cooking adding that it is possible to whip up quick but delicious treats for visitors within a short span.
Mix butter or a fat spread with chopped curry leaves and curry powder and prepare a spread. Toast some bread and spread the mixture on it. You can serve this with a spinach and dhal soup. This will be a refreshing experience for your guests, she noted.
Creative punches made using tea is another innovative manner in which you can serve your loved ones.
Tea goes well with sour flavours like mint or lime. You can top this up with some ice cubes. We normally serve our guests with a tea or coffee. This will be a delightful surprise for them, she added.
Chathurika says that there is no need to spend huge sums on making innovative meals. You can prepare mouthwatering treats with what is available at home.
You can take out a piece of chicken from your chicken curry, shred it and blend it with some chopped onion and garlic, you can serve this on a toast or cream cracker, she said.
The manner in celebrating Christmas has changed though it has not lost its values. There is more festivity and celebrations today than in the past.
Queried on what is the most frequent culinary mistake that she has come across in Christmas cooking, Chathurika says that most people are into fusion cooking these days.
They dont know the correct proportions. One handy tip I would like to give to our housewives this season is to follow you natural instincts. For example to get the golden colour on your roast chicken or duck, look for the ingredients which make that shade on your spice rack. Combine one or two pinches of turmeric and chili powder together and add that to the chicken before baking it. Instead of using oil, you can add a bit of sugar for the glaze, she opined.
She adds that you can use protein packed items like tofu, dhal and spinach if you are cooking a festive meal for a vegetarian or vegan.
There are a lot of vegetables you can use in your cooking. The only thing you might lose is the flavours but you can still make a delicious and nutritious meal for vegetarians with these ingrediants, she said.
Armed with 11 years experience in the field Chathurika has a passion to create new flavours and dishes. She had previously been in the designing sector.
I realized that I can play a bigger role in the culinary field. I changed my profession at a time nobody would take such a decision. Since I have the designer in me, I believe in my power of creativity, she smiled adding that she is still a learner and that she keeps on upgrading her knowledge.
Though Chathurikas mother has been a Home Science teacher she says that she did not possess the passion of cooking during her school days. She trained at Win-Stone School of Culinary Arts and is a member of the Ceylon Chefs Guild.
If you can infuse the excitement of Christmas into your everyday lifestyle, then everyday will be a Christmas day for you. Love should be spread throughout the year and not only limited to the Christmas time. If you can celebrate that spirit within your heart always, then I think God will always be there with you, she concluded with a smile.

The real Santa story!
What are the perennial symbols of Christmas which comes on December 25 every year If you answered Christmas trees and Santa Claus, you can be forgiven for forgetting that Christmas is actually the day we celebrate the both of Jesus Christ, Son of God.
A recent survey conducted in the USA found that a large number of children actually think Christmas marks the birthday of that jovial character clad in red, riding on a sled pulled by a herd of reindeer, distributing gifts among well-behaved children: none other than Santa Claus. Even in Sri Lanka, which does not experience any kind of winter, one can see a good number of Santas wandering about in shopping malls and other areas.
Who really is Santa Claus Is he a completely mythical character or someone who actually existed once upon a time There is a healthy debate on this point, though there is no doubt whatsoever that he adds an element of colour and amusement to the festivities. What we do know is that region he is supposed to come from - Lapland  actually exists. Lapland is Finlands northernmost region, a sparsely populated area bordering Sweden, Norway, Russia and the Baltic Sea. It is known for its vast subarctic wilderness, ski resorts and natural phenomena including the Midnight Sun and the Northern Lights. And oh, the official animal and symbol of the region is naturally the reindeer, Santas trusted work horse.
Santas Village
The Finnish Tourist Board says that Rovaniemi is the capital of Finnish Lapland and the hometown of Santa Claus. There is a Santas Village in the region which you can visit. Children worldwide write to Santa at this address and even come here from all over the world to witness Santas official departure on December 23 every year to distribute gifts. Santa Claus spends his time at the Santa Claus Village every day of the year to take care of his mission in life; to enhance the well-being of children and the kindness of grown-ups, as well as spreading the message of love and goodwill and the Christmas Spirit across the globe, says the Finnish Tourist Board.
With that out of the way, we can dwell further on who Santa Claus is. This is the standard textbook definition of Santa that I came across in several websites while doing research for this article: Santa Claus, also known as Saint Nicholas, Kris Kringle, Father Christmas, or simply Santa, is a legendary figure originating in Western Christian culture who is said to bring gifts to the homes of well-behaved children on Christmas Eve and the early morning hours of Christmas Day.
To answer our question on whether Santa Claus was a real person or at least based on a real person, the answer is yes. The legend of Santa Claus can be traced back hundreds of years to a monk named St. Nicholas. It is believed that Nicholas was born sometime around 280 A.D. in Patara, near Myra in modern-day Turkey. Much admired for his piety and kindness, St. Nicholas became the subject of many legends over time. It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and travelled the countryside helping the poor and the sick. Over the course of many years, Nicholass popularity spread and he became known as the protector of children and sailors. His feast day is celebrated on the anniversary of his death, December 6. By the Renaissance period, St. Nicholas was the most popular saint in Europe.
Saint Nicholas
The name Santa Claus evolved from his Dutch nickname, Sinter Klaas, a shortened form of Sint Nikolaas (Dutch for Saint Nicholas). In 1804, John Pintard, a member of the New York Historical Society, distributed woodcuts of St. Nicholas at the societys annual meeting. The background of the engraving contains Santa images including stockings filled with toys and fruit hung over a fireplace. Stores began to advertise Christmas shopping in 1820, and by the 1840s, newspapers were creating separate sections for holiday advertisements, which often featured images of the newly-popular Santa Claus. In 1841, thousands of children visited a Philadelphia, USA shop to see a life-size Santa Claus model.
Then stores began to attract children with the lure of a peek at a live Santa Claus. In the early 1890s, the Salvation Army needed money to pay for the free Christmas meals they provided to needy families. They began dressing up unemployed men in Santa Claus suits and sending them into the streets of New York to solicit donations. This was a great success that continues to this day.
In 1822, Clement Clarke Moore, wrote a rather long Christmas poem for his three daughters entitled An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas. Moores poem is largely responsible for our modern image of Santa Claus as a portly figure and the supernatural ability to ascend a chimney. Although some of Moores images were probably copied from elsewhere, his poem helped popularize the now-familiar image of a Santa Claus who went from house to house on Christmas Eve, preferably via the chimney.
Modern image
An Account of a Visit from St. Nicholas created a new icon. In 1881, political cartoonist Thomas Nast drew on Moores poem to create the first likeness that matches our modern image of Santa Claus. His cartoon, which appeared in Harpers Weekly, depicted Santa as a rotund, cheerful man with a full, white beard, holding a sack laden with toys for lucky children. It is Nast who gave Santa his bright red suit trimmed with white fur, North Pole workshop, elves, and of course, his wife, Mrs. Claus.
And if you have ever heard the song my grandma got run over by a reindeer you know that Santa has some super fast friends for his delivery side of things. But there were only eight in the original herd  the ninth and the most famous one was born much later. The red-nosed wonder was the creation of Robert L. May, a copywriter at the Montgomery Ward department store. In 1939, May wrote a Christmas-themed story-poem to help bring holiday traffic into his store. Using a similar rhyme pattern to Moores Twas the Night Before Christmas, May told the story of Rudolph, a young reindeer who was teased by the other deer because of his large, glowing, red nose. But, When Christmas Eve turned misty and Santa was thinking how to deliver gifts, the red nosed reindeer saved Santa by leading the sleigh by the light of his red nose. Rudolphs message - that given the opportunity, a liability can be turned into an asset - proved very popular. Apart from the one I have mentioned, there are many songs about this red-nosed delivery expert.
The next time you see a Santa somewhere, just remember that he is literally a legendary character who has done a lot more than distribute gifts among the worlds good children. Yes, today Santa has become very much a symbol of commercialism that sometimes overrides the very religious nature of Christmas in a money-oriented world, but one cannot disagree that he brings happiness to millions of children  and adults  in a world that needs a little bit of fun and frolic.

Runs key as top South Africa, Pakistan bowlers square up
CENTURION Monday: Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur identified the need for his batsmen to post good totals as a key factor in their three-Test series against South Africa, starting at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Wednesday.
The one thing we do know is that we can get 20 wickets comfortably. Our challenge is to get to 350-400 (runs), Arthur said in a pre-tour interview.
It is a refrain that could be echoed by Ottis Gibson, his South African counterpart, ahead of a series which pits two strong sets of bowlers against potentially fragile batting line-ups in a country where conditions usually offer bowlers plenty of encouragement.
The bowling strength of both teams is formidable, despite the lack of what had been anticipated as an intriguing match-up of exceptionally accurate seamers between South Africa's Vernon Philander and Pakistan's rising star Mohammad Abbas.
Philander has a broken finger, while Abbas is recovering from a shoulder injury.
Abbas did not bowl in Pakistan's win against a South African Invitation XI last week but Arthur did not rule him out oFf contention for Test selection.
Even without Abbas, a pace attack of Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali and Shaheen Afridi, backed by the leg-spin of Yasir Shah, will pose a challenge for the home batsmen.
South Africa will also be without fast bowler Lungi Ngidi because of a long-term knee injury but veteran Dale Steyn, needing just one wicket to become his country's leading wicket-taker, bowled with good pace and rhythm in a recent Twenty20 tournament, as did fellow spearhead Kagiso Rabada.
Duanne Olivier, who will be South Africa's third seamer, was the top wicket-taker in the T20 league and had match figures of seven for 54 in a losing cause in a franchise match last week. Pakistan's batting showed familiar frailty when they twice collapsed in the fourth innings in losing a Test series against New Zealand in the United Arab Emirates recently.
But Haris Sohail, Babar Azam, Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq all hit centuries in the same series, while most of Pakistan's top order were in the runs against the Invitation team.
South Africa have some batting problems, exacerbated by the retirement of AB de Villiers.
Opening batsmen Dean Elgar and Aiden Markram, consistent performers in home wins against India and Australia last season, have yet to find top form this season. Hashim Amla, 35, may be nearing the end of a distinguished career. In 10 Tests since his most recent century, against Bangladesh in October 2017, Amla has hit just four fifties and averaged a below-par 23.36.
He was out for a first-ball duck in a franchise match last week, although he made 61 in the second innings.
Captain Faf du Plessis and wicketkeeper Quinton de Kock have been in reasonable form but Theunis de Bruyn and Temba Bavuma did not play in the most recent franchise matches because of back and hamstring strains respectively.
Teams South Africa (probable): Faf du Plessis (capt), Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Theunis de Bruyn, Hashim Amla, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Duanne Olivier Pakistan (from): Sarfraz Ahmed (capt/wkt), Asad Shafiq, Azhar Ali, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Sohail, Hasan Ali, Imam-ul-Haq, Mohammad Abbas, Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Rizwan, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Afridi, Shan Masood, Yasir Shah Umpires: Bruce Oxenford (AUS), Sundaram Ravi (IND) TV umpire: Joel Wilson (WIN).

Split of a second, I saw Jesus in you
It happened one glorious moment when we met first.In a flash I saw Jesus in your heavenly smile.The wind russled when you seized my heart and soulWhen all these years I searched the truthUnaware it was knocking at my doorUntil the shimmering mantle fell on you.
As days passed to years, found the vacuum painfulUntil one day; in one bright summer mornIt stirred and merged as the vision in my heartI saw you at a distance, breathless beyond control.Virtually my guiding light in darkness.And knew I found you, my Lord on earth.
Cascading water from purple mountain topsCrash hard on the slimy slippery rocksRoar and thunder, awake the sleepy woodsAs you wander, I see you as the golden throthWhen floating clouds part to revealThe Lord who gently stole my heart
You are the wind in my hair that softly blow,Wild over cliffs to reach the sky;And join the mighty river gushing downAs dancing ripples swirl the flowWalking through the woods treading snowdropsPraising Jesus born to save us sinners.
From lofty green hills far awayTo glittering sandy valleysWhen I had a wondrous dream one sunny dayIt was blurred as many dreams areAnd I opened my sleepy eyes to confrontYour vision as the blur cleared away
You are the one I revere and loveWho walks beside me day after dayUnseen, unheard but always nearFeel your fragrance that never fadeAnd lessons you preach in wisdom wiseGives me strength and courage in sustenance.
Footsteps gently placed on earthYou guide the way to Lord Jesus ChristWhen you caress the withered flowers,They spring back to life and bloomGod has chosen you to shepherd His flockAnd placed the staff in your keep.
Cherish every moment at your feetEvery hour unto eternity.Warm and kind; you light each dayWhatever season be; spring or summerAutumn fresh to winter harshEach morn shine and glow on you.
You are my wide wondrous worldWhen I see you mountains moveAs gales and storms rip through,And turn around at your commandYou calm the rising sea and berate the wavesMiracle or not, in my eyes they behold

Thambana villagers trot long way to town without a bridge
Villagers of Thambana in the Medagama Divisional Secretariat in Moneragala suffer immensely without a bridge over Kiulelanda stream to reach the town.
They said Thambana has over 52 families with about 300 members. In rainy seasons, their children do not attend schools until water subsides. They said everyone in the village including the schoolchildren get confined to the village in the rainy seasons.
R, M, Anulawathi, a resident, told Daily News that the students come in clothes they wear for homes near to the stream and dress in their school uniforms after crossing the stream.
She said the villagers face a dilemma when someone fell sick in the rainy seasons for there is no way for them to take the patient to hospital.
Lalitha Padmini, another resident, said Thambana is around 40 km away from Moneragala. One has to take Madugalla road from Moneragala and turn from the Ruwalwela Junction and come to Thamabana along the Medagama Road. She said politicians have been visiting village since 1948 yet they failed to build a bridge which they promised at every election. They urge authorities to construct a bridge over the stream to ease their burden.

Tinsel Tales: Lights and Baubles
Bells jingle, lights glitter, trees are topped with sparkling stars, and children everywhere dream of Santa Claus and presents. But the best gift of all-the most magical gift of the season-is when we spend Christmas with those we love  under a Christmas tree.As in your house, so in mine, there stands a Christmas tree in the corner of the living room. Alive. Breathing. Watching. And finally talking.You want to write about my story asks my tree. No I tell him. Everyone already knows your story. It began in Germany almost 1,000 years ago when St Boniface, who converted the German people to Christianity, was said to have come across a group of pagans worshiping an oak tree. In anger, St Boniface cut down the oak tree and to his amazement a young fir tree sprung up from the roots of the oak tree. St Boniface took this as a sign of the Christian faith. But it was not until the 16th century that fir trees were brought indoors at Christmas time.
But there is more to the story of Christmas trees. Insists my tree.  Read Penne Restad's book on Christmas trees called Christmas in America to find out more about how Christmas is celebrated today. I follow his advice and surf the net in search of the book. Yes, Penne Restad, a University of Texas historian, has much to say about the role of the Christmas tree in the modern world. As she sees it, the Christmas tree is the focal point of a celebration that honors families and the home, separate from the religious holiday on the same date.
The Christmas tree has become a physical center of the holiday, says Prof. Restad. You walk into a house, see a Christmas tree and know that is where everything will happen, where everyone will be. It's the heart of the familial celebration of Christmas that may have no connection to the religious celebration.
I read the words out loud to my Christmas tree realizing the truth behind her observation, for here I am, a non-Christian (and I know there are many others like me) with Christmas trees in our sitting rooms right this minute. This is why, the tree, decorated in millions of different homes every year all over the world can be seen as a unifying thread explains Prof.Restad. We're all doing the same thing but we're doing it in our own, personal way.The one in my house, who has suddenly turned into my guru on Christmas trees appears to be a stickler for perfection. He offers more advice. Why don't you read the article written by Prof.David McGrath about Christmas trees for the Los Angeles Times, last Christmas Tired of being so obedient, I decide to postpone my search and check my email inbox instead. But the transformation in my tree is too hard to ignore. The leaves begin to droop reminding me of Grumpy in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Ok. I mutter under my breath and search for Prof. McGrath's article.
It turns out he is a father who wants to offer his daughter Janet, many arguments against the wasteful practice of buying a real Christmas tree. He confesses he had had the same argument with his wife for thirty years. Real ones had always been important to her  the annual pilgrimage to the tree lot on a chilly night, the scent of pine, keepsake ornaments. For me, it's a mess of trouble for something you discard after two weeks, not to mention $50 that would be better put toward gifts or charity. At least, that's been my losing argument going on 30 years. He wonders why Janet and her husband Kevin should launch their own 30 years of wasteful practice and hopes Kevin might be allergic to the pungent smell of pine leaves and not buy a real tree. But when his daughter telephones to ask him, from 1,500 miles away what kind of tree they should buy he gives in, forgets all his arguments and suggests she buy a Uh, probably balsam fir. They last the longest.
I decide to write to Prof. McGrath, though I am sure he would not want to answer the questions of a strange, foreign journalist sent in an email, even in this season of giving. To my surprise I receive a response. Since my Times piece, there has been more research and debate about the tradition of real tree vs. artificial, much of which shows that buying real trees is better for the environment than buying artificials, because of the global/chemical benefits of tree farms. Prof. McGrath tells me. What I found with both my wife and daughter, is that the proverbial family heart trumps such practical concerns. Prof. McGrath thinks that what is vital is that it doesn't have to be a tree, per se: any talisman or symbol that serves to perpetuate the idea and feeling (love) of family, even when far from home, or when members are absent, is what's vital. It could be a tree or a music box or a dish or a photo or a song. For my wife and children, it's the tree, and any pragmatic objections that I have are dwarfed by the primacy of family.
Perhaps imagining the fellow Christmas trees standing in the houses of Prof. McGrath and his daughter Janet right this minute, my tree too cheers up. And I realize how attractive he is, even though till now I had only noticed the gaps between the branches on his left side, and that he was stooping too much to the right. Looking at him now, from this particular angle, in the glow from the monitor of my computer I realize he is as handsome as...well...Daniel Day Lewis!
No wonder as I gaze at my Christmas tree I feel exactly like how Scrooge feels at the end of Charles Dickens Christmas Carol. ...as light as a feather, .. as happy as an angel, ...as merry as a school-boy...as giddy as a drunken man (though totally sober).
So, in the spirit of the festive season, let me borrow a quote from Scrooge to end my story. A merry Christmas to every-body! A happy New Year to all the world!

Tips on Christmas gifts to give em fits!
Merry Yuletide morning, Sri Lanka! The festive countdown is over. The midnight candlelit services have been well attended. Now at daybreak the church bells are beckoning early risers to come and worship. It is Christmas and the festive chimes along with the thunder of firecrackers are heralding an event of renewal, a season of joy and an occasion for understanding and new commitments.
At the moment many of you must be knee-deep in wrapping paper while giving and receiving seasonal gifts. But the problem with seasonal gifts, or any gifts for that matter, is that you almost always give something you want for yourself. Many people will put on a fake smile about the unwanted, horrible gift they just received but others will try to pass it on to another victim.
I did too, but only once and with darn good reason. I was given a Sudoku compendium by a mean relative who knows I am innumerate. Every column, row, and 33 square had to contain the figures 1 through 9 exactly once. The rules of Sudoku are surprisingly simple. Just Count to Nine! Okay I may be hopeless at mathematics but I am not exactly retarded and can manage to count to ten!
Are you a re-gifter I am usually not. But I defiantly re-gifted the Sudoku book to my grand-daughter Keshini Davina who is a whiz at the numbers game. And she loved it. The cycle is known as the gift that keeps giving.
People give me books they want to read, music they enjoy listening to and subscriptions to publications they value. And then I have been gifted with some of the most unwanted literary drivel such as The Music of Bach by Aaron G. String, The Singer by Barry Tone and All My Travels by Wanda Lust.
All these books must have had their authors in spasms of writers cramp and totally painful in terms of reader digestion. They are big tomes with a surplus of inconsequential poppycock which I will review with an economy of words in this column: These novels are not to be tossed lightly aside, but to be hurled with great force.
This year, however, a bright shining bulb illuminated my hazy noggin. I would recommend only gifts I myself desired! As an author myself I hate these books I just mentioned. But as an angler to boot I will bait my hooks on my favourite author who reminds me of myself. As a matter of fact, it does happen to be myself.
Again as an unbiased reviewer I would dare say if you havent read my satire book The Serendib Spirit you havent lived. So youd better buy one because its better read before you are dead. And youll have no choice but to believe me book, line, and sinker!
But getting back to the subject of seasonal gifts you must be aware that men and boys want things to play with instead of things to wear. Women want things to wear instead of things to play with. The key to remember is that men want hardware while women want software. And no, we arent talking about the stuff of the computer kind.
And even worse, perhaps is receiving a gift that you wouldnt buy for your worst enemy. Well, maybe you would for your worst enemy, but only if its on sale. Please avoid anything pink for some men who go paranoid about the colour. Thats because they feel its a feminine colour. But the actual fact is that they feel effeminate. They hate everything pink including shirts, ties, socks and handkerchiefs. I for one, can carry off a pink shirt and tie rather admirably but stop short of the matching socks and handkerchief.
So if you have a boss with an anti-pink colour neurosis who you dont like, give him a set of pink handkerchiefs and socks. But make sure you have secured another job before you inscribe these words on the gift card: Inky pinky Polly  Hitler looks a dolly  or rather a seenimutai candy floss for an el-hombre tyrannical boss.
I also gave a spiteful woman acquaintance, named Victoria a gift certificate for a facelift, soon after I came to know she had contracted chicken pox. I told her it was the best gift I could think of for our Itchy, Witchy, Bitchy Vicky!
There is also no better way to ruin someones holiday than to arm their children with the toys to endlessly annoy them. You can ensure your arch-enemy friends are thrown into a nightmare of your own wicked making. Here are some good ways to use your ill-wishers children as proxies in a war of annoyance.
Try giving a toy ice-cream maker with which the kids can actually make the real thing. The whole home will become a sticky, gelatinous mess. Then there is the Daddle Saddle which is a saddle for Dads to wear. Your child rides you around the house like a horse. Again. And again. And again. And again. So you have to go giddy-up a ding-dong as long as your spine holds out. They also back heel you in places that are unmentionably sensitive.
Into your carefully calibrated world of gift-giving punishment are other such exasperating devices such as the noisiest toys imaginable. Percussion is a great choice, kettledrums, Moroccan bongos, Chinese cymbals, virudu rabanas and yes, ear-splitting whistles. The whistles are sure to create chaos and drive the traffic cops bonkers during the rush hour.
They are also guaranteed to create confusion and spark a riot during a soccer or rugby match. Because half the fun of watching a rugby game in Sri Lanka these days is watching the referee being beaten up. Add a few cap guns to your inventory that make a loud bang similar to a gunshot and exude a puff of smoke. They will drive their parents up the wall while youll be voted the most popular Uncle of the Year.
Sometimes I get the feeling that if Christmas, Fathers Day and birthdays did not exist, then aftershave too, would not exist! I am an obsessive bather. I sometimes take four showers a day. But some people I know should take a bath, or shower, every once in a while.
So a pack of soap might be the best choice of a gift for them and they might be complimented on their appealing new aroma. And remember men do not wear perfume. They dab on after-shave. And maybe people will tell you after you emerge from a shower, You smell good, and ask whats the name of the after-shave you are wearing And you simply reply with a sly smile on your face, It lathers well with water. Its called soap!
Merry Christmas everybody!

A walk through time
Theres a certain festive feel in the air with Christmas right around the corner. With Yuletide spirit in full swing around the globe let us take a walk down the road of history to have a look at how Christmas originated.
History of Christmas
Christmas is both a sacred religious holiday and a worldwide cultural and commercial phenomenon. For two millennia, people around the world have been observing it with traditions and practices that are both religious and secular in nature. Christians celebrate Christmas Day as the anniversary of the birth of Jesus of Nazareth. Popular customs include exchanging gifts, decorating Christmas trees, attending church, sharing meals with family and friends and, of course, waiting for Santa Claus to arrive.
An ancient holiday
The middle of winter has long been a time of celebration around the world. Centuries before the arrival of the man called Jesus, early Europeans celebrated light and birth in the darkest days of winter. Many people rejoiced during the winter solstice, when the worst of the winter was behind them and they could look forward to longer days and extended hours of sunlight.
In Scandinavia, the Norse celebrated Yule from December 21, the winter solstice, through January. In recognition of the return of the sun, fathers and sons would bring home large logs, which they would set on fire. The people would feast until the log burned out, which could take as many as 12 days. The Norse believed that each spark from the fire represented a new pig or calf that would be born during the coming year.
The end of December was a perfect time for celebration in most areas of Europe. At that time of year, most cattle were slaughtered so they would not have to be fed during the winter. For many, it was the only time of year when they had a supply of fresh meat. In addition, most wine and beer made during the year was finally fermented and ready for drinking.
In Germany, people honoured the pagan god Oden during the mid-winter holiday. Germans were terrified of Oden, as they believed he made nocturnal flights through the sky to observe his people, and then decide who would prosper or perish. Because of his presence, many people chose to stay inside.
Saturnalia
In Rome, where winters were not as harsh as those in the far north, Saturnalia - a holiday in honour of Saturn, the god of agriculture - was celebrated. Beginning in the week leading up to the winter solstice and continuing for a full month, Saturnalia was a hedonistic time, when food and drink were plentiful and the normal Roman social order was turned upside down. For a month, slaves would become masters. Peasants were in command of the city. Business and schools were closed so that everyone could join in the fun.
Also around the time of the winter solstice, Romans observed Juvenalia, a feast honoring the children of Rome. In addition, members of the upper classes often celebrated the birthday of Mithra, the god of the unconquerable sun, on December 25. It was believed that Mithra, an infant god, was born of a rock. For some Romans, Mithras birthday was the most sacred day of the year.
In the early years of Christianity, Easter was the main holiday; the birth of Jesus was not celebrated. In the fourth century, church officials decided to institute the birth of Jesus as a holiday.
By holding Christmas at the same time as traditional winter solstice festivals, church leaders increased the chances that Christmas would be popularly embraced, but gave up the ability to dictate how it was celebrated. By the Middle Ages, Christianity had, for the most part, replaced pagan religion. On Christmas, believers attended church, then celebrated raucously in a drunken, carnival-like atmosphere similar to todays Mardi Gras. Each year, a beggar or student would be crowned the lord of misrule and eager celebrants played the part of his subjects. The poor would go to the houses of the rich and demand their best food and drink. If owners failed to comply, their visitors would most likely terrorize them with mischief. Christmas became the time of year when the upper classes could repay their real or imagined debt to society by entertaining less fortunate citizens.
Meaning of Christmas
The Significance of Christmas is known to men, all over the world. Though it is true that Christmas is celebrated as the day of the Birth of Christ into this world, yet it also symbolizes a very deeply significant truth of the spiritual life. Jesus Christ is the personification of Divinity. He was born at a time when ignorance, superstition, greed, hatred and hypocrisy prevailed upon the land.
In the midst of these conditions, Christ was born and He there was a transformation in the lives of people. He gave a new and a spiritual turn to the lives of man. There came a change upon the land. People started upon a new way of life. Thus a new era dawned for the world. If the people must enter into a new life of spiritual aspiration, purity and devotion, then the Christ must be born within his heart. That is the real Christmas when the Divine element begins to express itself in the heart of the man. From then onward, light begins to shine where darkness was before.

Yearender: New Tigers still the man to watch, if not the man to beat
The most memorable scene in golf in 2018 was not the conclusion to a major championship, but rather the sight of a frenzied gallery swarming over the final fairway as a familiar figure stood on the brink of a win some doubted would ever come.
Tiger Woods had gone more than five years without a victory when he rolled into Atlanta for the Tour Championship, the September season-ender on the PGA Tour that often ranks as one of the most boring events on the schedule.
Not this time, though, thanks to the games transcendent figure. As the saying goes, Tiger doesnt just move the needle, he is the needle.
It had already been a successful year for 14-times major winner Woods, simply by being able to compete without pain again after a successful April 2017 spinal fusion that rectified a potentially career-ending back injury.
Woods had already threatened to win several times, including at the final two majors, dispensing any doubts as to whether he could be competitive again after being stricken with back pain from 2014 to 2017.
It seemed every fan at East Lake was willing him to victory, and when he hit his approach to the final green it was all but a done deal.
As thousands of fans flooded the fairway in a scene reminiscent of British Opens of yesteryear, Woods almost disappeared into the sea of humanity, only a half dozen security officers keeping him from being mobbed.
He was clearly moved by all the love, at 42 almost coming over as a man of the people.
Well, maybe not quite an Arnold Palmer-like man of the people, but, nonetheless, here was a remarkable transformation, fashioned, no doubt, by the humility that comes from dealing with adversity.
The victory, Woods 80th on the PGA Tour, brought him within two of the all-time record held by Sam Snead, a far more attainable mark than the 18 major titles of Jack Nicklaus.
While Woods fell short in the majors, the inscrutable Brooks Koepka won two  successfully defending his U.S. Open crown before adding the PGA Championship  with performances that were greeted with a proverbial yawn in the golf world.
GENERALLY APATHETIC
It is not so much that fans dislike Koepka as much as they are generally apathetic about a player whose lack of charisma and outward emotion make him difficult to connect with. Koepka was joined on the major honour roll by Patrick Reed, whose giant chip on his shoulder did not prevent him from slipping easily into the green jacket awarded to the winner of the Masters.
And 35-year-old Francesco Molinari raised his game to a new level, finally finding a short game and putting stroke to match his long-admired full swing, as he became Italys first-ever major winner in the British Open.
And he did so by ignoring the commotion that accompanied Tigers charge into the lead halfway through the final round and methodically reeling in his playing partner before emerging from a six-way tie for the lead to claim the Claret Jug.
Molinari also swept all five of his matches in golfs premier team event, the Ryder Cup, as Europe again proved invincible in their own backyard, beating the Americans in Paris for their sixth straight home win while extending the U.S. away-day drought to 25 years and counting.
Ariya Jutanugarn captured the biggest womens event, the U.S. Open, but not before blowing a seven-stroke lead on the back nine at Shoal Creek in Alabama.
A triple-bogey at the 10th hole greased the wheels for the Thai, who eventually skidded into a playoff with South Korean Kim Hyo-joo. It could have gone down in history as one of the games great chokes, had not Ariya redeemed herself by winning in extra holes.
The golf world endured several losses in 2018, none more tragic than that of 19-year-old Spanish amateur Celia Barquin Arozamena, murdered while playing alone at a course in the U.S. state of Iowa, where she had been on a university golf scholarship.
The sport also mourned the passing of five-times British Open winner Peter Thomson (88), double major winner Hubert Green (71), 13-times PGA Tour winner Bruce Lietzke (67) and Australian Jarrod Lyle, who battled leukaemia for more than half his life before succumbing to the disease at the age of 36.

CHRISTMAS MESSAGES
Incarnation will illuminate darkness
We approach the end of another calendar year and the dawn of the Christmas season.
For us humans, it is so very easy to lose focus when something becomes too familiar and this is more so with Christmas.
The many external elements associated with this deeply spiritual festival of the coming into this world of a baby whose scripture refers to as 'lmmanuel - God himself with us', hides and makes us to forget the true meaning and significance of Christmas.
The Gospel writers, Mathew and Luke do not also hide the striking paradoxes between the nature of this baby, who is referred to as the 'Messiah, Prince of Peace, Saviour, Christ the Lord, Holy One, Son of the Most High, King of the Jews......, on the one hand, and the circumstances of his birth on the other; in the backyard of a lodging house, to a carpenter and his humble peasant wife, his first visitors, keepers of animals, very low down in the social hierarchy.
This duality is seen right through the short earthly life of Jesus, hailed as the, Teacher, Master, Rabbi, Anointed One, Messiah, Son of God, he prefers to refer to himself as the 'Son of Man', as one' come to serve, rather than to be served', as 'having no place of his own to rest'. Finally he was publicly executed like a common criminal. Christmas invites us to reflect on this duality or paradox and reminds us of the humility, servant-hood and sacrificial death of Jesus the Messiah and of the path that we followers of the Master must ourselves tread.
"The people walking in darkness have seen a great light; On those living in the land of deep darkness, a light has dawned". (lsaiah 9:2-7)
At a time of uncertainty, darkness, and chaos in our dear Land, let us resolve to walk in that light, so that the light of the incarnation will illuminate the darkness that threatens to engulf us all.
I wish all our peoples a blessed, meaningful and joyful season of Christmas and God's Peace in the New Year.

Priority to local construction industrialists
Safeguarding local construction industrialists is a duty of the government and the time has come to implement the 'Sri Lanka First' concept in the field of construction, Housing, Construction, and Cultural Affairs Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was speaking at the National Construction Award Ceremony held recently at the BMICH.
Minister Premadasa said that most of the people those who involved in the construction field are trying to bring foreign investors since they believe that the business community and the public cannot get benefits through a business procedure depend on local opportunities.
Within a common legal framework, foreign investors have been able to incur large profits. But now the time has come to give priority for local construction industrialists and new conditions should be implemented to make it compulsory for all foreign investors to join with a local investor when they are going to invest in large-scale projects. Those conditions should also be connected to the legal framework.
Local construction industrialists have to face various difficulties without receiving their payments on time. Though we submitted several proposals to the Cabinet of Ministers seeking their approval for the implementation of Contract Payment Grants, but still there is any response for that.
I have submitted another Cabinet paper seeking approval to implement a special legal procedure to make payments of the contractors under a transparent legal procedure. the minister said.
Minister Premadasa further stressed the importance of setting up a Construction Industries Development Fund in order to give due social respect and recognition to the human resources of this field.

Reason for the season
Tis the time to gift happiness
The pall of gloom brought about by the political crisis in the country was lifted just at the right time when Sri Lankan Christians were on the threshold of celebrating Christmas.
There was much trepidation among the Lankan Christians if Christmas this time was going to be a dull and somber affair, given the enormity of the crisis that began exactly two months before Christmas. Thankfully things have resolved themselves in the nick of time and the spirit of Christmas is almost tangibly felt with the usual bustling activity associated with the festive season very much in evidence
Whatever the gloomy picture, Christmas cannot be separated from the age old merriment and it is doubtful if things would have changed much even with the crisis on .The spirit of Christmas is all pervasive and the season of Yuletide is looked forward to with much anticipation, even during the darkest spells of history in the Christian world.
The run up to Christmas, as always, is a hive of activity in many homes. The colour washing is done even as early as October and as December approaches it is time to get started on the traditional Christmas cake. Shopping is an integral part of the Christmas agenda and the school holidays makes it that much fun .As usual at this time of the year the streets are choked with milling crowds. Yuletide perennials blare forth from shops which are gaily decorated with Christmas trappings. Scented cypresses are lined up for sale on city pavements in their profusion brining the Christmas atmosphere very much alive.
It is also the time for big business.Rubicund cheeked Santa Clauses beam out from shop windows advertising the latest brands. Special Christmas hampers are laid out at supermarkets and luxury stores. It is holiday time for school and the offices with employees taking their annual leave in bulk. Peoples faces mirror a general air of gaiety and joy filled with a sense of anticipation.
Present day Christmas celebrations have changed over the years in tempo and form. Christmas shopping in the past was a leisurely affair unlike todays mad scramble. Though salaries were small compared to the present day there was always plenty in reserve for Christmas. The lavish bonuses dished out by many mercantile firms helped fuel the Christmas cheer.
Shoppers also had their favourite stores unlike today when everything could be bought under one roof. Alas, most of these landmarks are no more although old timers still speak of them with a sense of nostalgia.
Christmas was also a much looked forward to event in the now almost extinct Burgher community which dominated many pockets in the Colombo city areas such as Hulftsdorp, Princess Gate Grandpass and Kotahena. For them Christmas was all about merriment and revelry with no expenses spared. The Bachchanial roister that began days before the great event will progress well into the New Year.
Preparation
In the good old days the preceding weeks were devoted to stocking up where the stores were conveyed in the then ubiquitous rickshaws. Central to the run up to Christmas was the preparation of the Christmas cake for which the assorted ingredients were preserved in jars months ahead. Carols were another feature sung with gusto to perfect harmonising by members of the family and extended family in all Burgher homes.
In the weeks preceding Christmas it is also common to see carol singers parading the streets in groups donned in fancy attire visiting every home collecting in the process a substantial purse invariably spent on binges. All this culminate in the midnight mass where the church overflows with the pious and the once a year church goers.It goes without saying that Christmas is a universal festival celebrated across different faiths, cultures and ethnic boundaries. No matter what gloom has descended the Christmas spirit cannot be dampened. This is why even amidst the worst economic depressions to hit the Western world s ago Christmas was celebrated without let or hindrance..
But is Christmas that marks the birth of Christ, the saviour of mankind observed in the way it should Is this great event heralding peace, joy and salvation to the world being abused and distorted Sadly amid the babel and humdrum surrounding the Christmas festivities the underlining message denoting the true meaning of the event is lost. Christmas today has been associated with unbridled commercialism and the cacophony of the market place.
Nay, Christmas has today become a commodity in the hands of multinational behemoths to rake in the shekels. Greed has overtaken the true message and meaning of Christmas which is sacrificed on the altar of mammon.
It is all too evident that Christmas today has been hijacked by business interests. It has become an occasion to bolster trade and business connection. Expensive hampers and other goodies are exchanged for favours in return - all in the backdrop of Christmas.
The contrast with the humble birth of the Christ Child in a manger surrounded by poor shepherds cannot be more glaring. Even the grandeur in which the Christmas mass is celebrated is at variance with the circumstances of the birth of Christ. Symbols such as the Christmas tree, the crib are only tokens for unbridled jollity. Sadly even the Church today has failed to get across the true message of Christmas to its flock. Nay, some its actions tend to betray shades of commercialism.
As a result, the spirit of giving, sharing and caring for the poor which is the essence of Christmas is subsumed in glitter of the festivities and merriment.
The level of commercialization of Christmas can be seen by the giant structures of the Nativity scenes adorning the frontages of supermarkets and shopping malls, the epitomes of luxury, ostentation and profiteering. Santa Clause is but a clownish figure doing his thing opposite shops and store fronts. Christmas should be rescued from the grip of mammon and made to revisit its true origins and hallowed message.
True meaning
Buried in all the joy and gaiety is the true meaning of Christmas with Christians tending to overlook the message of the birth of the redeemer two millennia ago in a cold stable surrounded by cattle and sheep. Instead the accent is on the outer trappings.
Christmas is called the season of giving and sharing, but mostly this giving and sharing is among the rich who have the capacity to return the favour. This is a distortion of the theme of Christmas which is today being used as a convenient tool to trade favours.
Hence it is vital for all Christians to hearken to the spirit of the message delivered by the birth of the redeemer and make Christmas a meaningful and spiritually fulfilling one. True, celebrations are in order for the great gift of God in sending his Son to this world to cleanse and purge all souls of the stain of sin. But the underlying message of Christmas should not be forgotten. Those who splurge on Christmas goodies should spare a thought for the orphans, the deprived and those in the numerous homes for the elders, the prisoners, the terminally ill and those on the verge of death, refugees fleeing oppression. Christ moved among the poor and the deprived and expects His followers to traverse in His footsteps.It should be rescued from the status of a commodity and salvaged from exploitation by the unscrupulous for profit and gain. A huge responsibility lies with the church and its guardians to redeem this most hallowed festival from its current decadence.
The underlying message of Christmas should be dinned into the faithful with more emphasis and vigour so that they will be enriched and inspired by the universal message of that far away first Christmas.

Sports Minister makes official visit to SLC HQ
We have to clear our name from cricket corruption
Newly appointed Minister of Sports Harin Fernando stated that the biggest issue Sri Lanka cricket was facing is that they have been named as the number one country for corruption and priority should be given to get the countrys name cleared of it.
The Minister made these remarks at a media conference held at SLC headquarters after he had made a official visit to the headquarters yesterday.
We want to clean up cricket first before everything and I will visit the ICC on Thursday and explain to them the current situation facing Sri Lanka Cricket and I hope they will never go against us appointing an interim committee, said Fernando.
The Minister further stated that it was important for SLC to come under an interim committee until the governing body was cleared of all allegations of corruption by the ICCs anti-corruption unit.
During interim committees our team has won all the major titles and it has not affected the teams progress, the Minister said.
Speaking further Minister Fernando stated, When compared with other countries like Australia and England they have few numbers in their vote system but in Sri Lanka there are so many votes.
It seems most of these clubs were established for vote purposes and not for cricket developments. I will bring someone who is clean, whom no one can find fault with and point fingers at.
The Minister said that former Sri Lanka captains Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene will be handing over their Cricket Development plan report to him yesterday.
I requested a cricket development plan from the former legends Kumar and Mahela and they will handing over their report to me today (Monday) evening at my ministry, the Minister said.
The SLC election is scheduled for February 7, but may be postponed if Minister Fernando gets the greenlight from ICC to postpone it.

This is the Kingdom of Love
Behold, the Lion of Judah! The Messiah, who came first as a child, but returns not as a child, but now as King of Kings, to rule in power and glory forever! - Rev. 21-4.
Jesus was not a politician or a businessman or a general. He came to earth to save us from our sins. He came to give us freedom and to spread the message of Love and the Kingdom of God. The best lessons we can learn this Christmas are from the life of Jesus himself. We learn about the importance of compassion because Jesus preached and practiced compassion. The gospels themselves state that he healed a paralyzed man (Matthew 9:6). He healed a Leper (Matthew 8:2). He had compassion on the demon possessed (Mathew 8:28). Right throughout He gave to others.
The Daily News spoke to Cardinal of the Catholic Church, Archbishop of Colombo, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith on the true meaning and the power of Christmas.
Jesus Christ has been foretold by the Prophets in the Old Testament as the person who is the Messiah who is the anointed one of God, who will come to earth to liberate human beings from all forms of slavery, especially from the slavery of the heart, from slavery from Egoism and Sin and the powers of death. He is the saviour. This has been said in the scriptures that is the Holy Bible, and he himself claimed that he came to earth to save us, said His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith.
Jesus was born in a manger in such lowly circumstances. One would think that it was the most inappropriate place for a king to be born. But Jesus came to establish a spiritual kingdom and not an earthly one.
When Jesus was taken before Pilate, and when Pilate questioned him are you a king Jesus said  Yes I am the king but I am not a king of this world. If I was a king of this world my adherents would never have allowed you to capture me like that. But my Kingdom is a spiritual Kingdom where there is Justice, Peace, Love and understanding. These are the values he came on earth to establish, changing the heart of man to accept that there is something more to life than eating, drinking and living, stated the Cardinal.
Divine and Spiritual realities
Christ died a horrible death on the cross. Yet there was no other way. He came to earth to reconcile god and man. That too teaches us a lesson about relationships. We must have humility in our relationships with others.
In fact they crucified him, and when they crucified him they put a message on top  Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. That crucifix is the throne on which he hung. His kingdom is not a worldly Kingdom. If it was a worldly Kingdom, he would be sitting on a throne, not on a cross. That is the Kingdom Jesus came to establish. A Kingdom that is close to Divine and Spiritual realities, pointed His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith.
This Christmas His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith wanted to convey a special message - which is fighting our selfishness. The Cardinal placed great emphasis on our selfishness that we have to struggle with. He attributes many of the problems we face today to selfishness. The youth must be especially mindful of this, this Christmas. Christmas is a time for giving because God gave his life to us.
There is so much selfishness around us. Many people are suffering ravages of this selfishness. It is found in the smaller level and as well as in the bigger level. All human beings are tempted to be selfish. The youth need to create a new culture. It should not be a society which is just socially emancipated. It should be something that is more profound and something more interior. That is the message I can give the youth. The youth need to works towards that. First start with yourself. We need to create a new society which is honest, sincere, which is altruistic, not thinking all the time about self but thinking about the others. To create that you need spiritual power. So we challenge the young people to gain spiritual power and change society, explained His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith.
Helping others
His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith spoke of change, saying that first by changing ourselves we can change the others. The Cardinal word touch ones heart deeply when he says that every single person who is oppressed and harassed must be freed. Every single patient who is in the hospital must be helped to recover. That is Christmas. It you take the Little Hearts Project in Sri Lanka, we must make sacrifices for those children. We must help others. The best way to celebrate Christmas is by helping others.
Commercialization of Christmas is a very sad thing. People are only focused on putting up these images of Santa Claus and concentrate on sales, Christmas concerts and gala dinners, which have nothing to do with Christmas. All these things are commercialization of Christmas. This is not the most important thing. Christmas speaks to us about the birth of a humble child. The child who changed the world. Every single child must be loved. That is Christmas which is loving our children, added His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith.
The most important part of the Ministry of Jesus, is when He spoke about the Kingdom of God and not the Kingdom of Man. He mentioned the word Kingdom many times, and it is found 151 times in the New Testament. He came to earth to establish the kingdom of God, not Mans Kingdom. Mans Kingdom is selfish. People who built Kingdoms here on earth, they wore crowns. They oppressed their people. Jesus wore the crown of the cross. He did not oppress anybody. He came to speak about love and service. He spoke about so many values.
Another humbling thing we can learn about Jesus is his capacity to forgive. Jesus said love your enemies, pray for them and bless them, and he did that on the cross. He prayed for those who nailed him to the cross. This is the Kingdom of Love, Mercy, humanity that he came to bring, said His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith.
God chose Mary to bear his child according to his own divine wisdom. She was a woman of admirable faith. Mary was Gods choice. Because God says in the Old Testament- Your ways are not my ways. Your thoughts are not my thoughts. Mary had deep faith in God. And so he chose her to conceive his son. Not because she was from a rich family or a noble family. They were quite normal people. But Gods choice fell on her.
Gods love for us has always been sincere and powerful. One big lie is that God does not love us. And this Christmas time we need to believe that he is a god of miracles and a god who wants a relationship with us. God has the power to change the circumstances we are in no matter how tough and impossible they may seem. We need to remember that this Christmas.
Love towards humanity
He made man in his own image because of the love he felt for humanity. He created creation by uttering a word as spoken in the book of Genesis. But he created man by making him from the earth in his own image and likeness and giving him his own breath. He created man as a very special creature. He loved humanity. He invited man to live in his own garden. But man defied him and disobeyed him. And thereby man condemned himself. Now he restores humanity by dying on the cross. On the tree humanity fell and on the tree humanity arose. That is the tree of the cross, explained His Eminence Cardinal Ranjith.
All the religions in this planet are religions that have helped humanity to rise up from the ashes of selfishness to something noble. All religions are like the sun whose rays fall on the budding little flowers that are growing in the muddy pond. These are beautiful flowers because they open to the sun. Therefore all religions can help us to rise up from our struggles.

ACUSL in utter disarray
The Association of Cricket Umpires Sri Lanka which was established in 1944 is undergoing the worst crisis in its 74 years history.
The ACUSL was formed with the intention of bringing a conformity to the game of cricket by the gentlemen who played cricket at the highest level like S P Foenander, Dodwell Zoysa, Athas Kuthoos to name a few.
There were many break-a-ways after the formation of the Association but never lasted long and they rejoined the parent group without any pre condition. The last to do it was late Upali Mahanama in the early 80s who reconciled the two break-a-way groups which comprised umpires of the caliber of K T Ponnambalam, D C Cammilus Perera, Vernon Tissera, Royle Barthelot, Gilbert Perera, Stanley Kuruppu, M D D N Gunaratne, Basil Anthony, P W Vidanagamage, Granville Hamer, Willie Wimalaratne, S Ponnadurai, K T Francis, Allen Felsinger, Herbie Felsinger, R Nadarajah, J M C Jayasinghe, M A Jayasinghe, Leslie Saverimuttu and Sarath Weerasuriya who were all first class umpires and office bearers of the Association.
This trend was followed upto 2010 where the first class umpires of Sri Lanka Cricket and senior members of ACUSL namely D M H Dissanayake, Neil Rodrigo, Thassim Junkeer, D A S Dissanayake, Saman Amarasinghe, Dickie Dunuwilla, E K G Wijewardena, R Chelvaratnam, D N Pathirana and B C Cooray were managing the administration of the association.
During the year 2010 due to some disagreement in forming a welfare branch in Colombo the association broke into three sections and still functioned separately. A former president with the assistance of the Sports Minister was trying their best to amalgamate all these associations to one in the interest of cricket and umpiring in Sri Lanka but as the demands of the break-a-way groups could not be met it went back to square one.
At present the main body of the ACUSL is without a President, a General Secretary, two Vice Presidents and an Assignment Secretary. The President, Two Vice Presidents and Secretary have resigned whereas the elected Assignment Secretary is unable to do his work as he is a coach of a leading school in Colombo for the last five years. Assignments are being handled by his assistant who was barred for five years by Sri Lanka Cricket from Umpiring and Cricket related matters.
The Under 19 SLSCA matches were also assigned to the SLSCA Tournament Secretary. Many Under 19 Division 1 schools were not happy with this arrangement as anything could have happened in crucial matches where their schools were involved.

Australia skipper Paine loving heated Kohli battle
MELBOURNE AFP Dec24, 2018 Australia skipper Tim Paine said Monday he is relishing his sometimes heated battle with animated Indian counterpart Virat Kohli, and promised intense, hard cricket in the crunch Boxing Day Test at Melbourne.
The pair had some testy exchanges in the second Test at Perth, which at one point needed the umpire to intervene.
And Kohli offered only a frosty handshake at the end of the game, which Australia won to level the four-Test series 1-1, refusing to meet Paine's eye in a move blasted by some as disrespectful. But Paine said he appreciated that Kohli never liked to lose. A lot was made of my battle with Virat in the second Test, and for the past few years when I haven't been playing international cricket, he was one guy I loved watching, he said in a column for Melbourne's Herald Sun.
Now to be out in the middle going head-to-head with him in a Test series is something I'm really relishing. Paine said he was not annoyed in the slightest by Kohli looking straight past him at the handshake.
Virat is someone who is prepared to wear his heart on his sleeve and like all professional athletes, hates to lose, he said.
I like the way Virat plays. I don't know him personally but I've always admired -- not only his obvious skill as a player -- but the passion and aggression he plays with. People like to see that and he gets fans through the gates. Kohli's antics in Perth, where he also failed to acknowledge the crowd's applause after he was controversially given out in the first innings for 123, brought a stunning rebuke from veteran Bollywood star Naseeruddin Shah. He described him as not only the world's best batsman but also the world's worst behaved player, with the mass-circulation Hindustan Times saying it articulated what many Indian cricket fans had been thinking. His behaviour when the Melbourne Test begins on Wednesday will closely watched, but he has the backing of coach Ravi Shastri who on Sunday called Kohli an absolute gentleman. Australian coach Justin Langer said Monday his biggest selection headache was whether to persist with middle-order batsman Peter Handscomb or recall all-rounder Mitch Marsh to ease the pressure on pace spearheads Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.
In a perfectly balanced side you'll have someone who can bowl some overs so Mitch becomes an attractive commodity on a wicket probably unlike Adelaide and Perth, he said, where the surface offered fast bowlers plenty of opportunities.
On the other hand, Handscomb would be an asset if the visitors opt for two spinners. India are sweating on the fitness of key spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who was sidelined with an abdominal strain for the Perth Test. Left-arm off-spinning all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja is also carrying a niggle but is expected to be fit, as is experienced batsman Rohit Sharma, who also missed the second Test.
India's main concern is the form of openers KL Rahul and Murali Vijay, who have struggled for runs, putting an extra burden on Kohli and number three Cheteshwar Pujara.
Shastri made clear on Sunday more was expected from them in Melbourne. It's obvious and that responsibility and accountability has to be taken by the top order, he said.
They've got the experience, they've got the exposure over these last few years to get out there and deliver.

Banned Steve Smith reveals details of ball-tampering debacle
SYDNEY, Sunday - Former Australia captain Steve Smith said he had not been involved in planning to tamper with the ball during the Cape Town test against South Africa but took responsibility as a leader for failing to put a stop to it.
Smith, along with vice-captain David Warner and opening batsman Cameron Bancroft, was suspended for his part in the ball-tampering incident which shocked the cricket world and torpedoed Australias sporting reputation. Facing Australian media for the first time since his teary apology at a news conference at Sydney airport on March 29, Smith said he had learned of the plan when he overheard a conversation in the teams dressing room at Newlands.
I think its been documented pretty heavily, sort of, what went on, he told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
For me in the room, I walked past something and had the opportunity to stop it and I didnt do it and that was my leadership failure.
It was the potential for something to happen and it went on and happened out in the field.
I had the opportunity to stop it at that point rather than say, I dont want to know anything about it and that was my failure of leadership. And you know Ive taken responsibility for that.
Smith declined to name the players involved but reiterated that he had told them, I dont want to know about it, and then walked away.
Smith has kept a low media profile since the scandal, despite playing at Twenty20 tournaments in Canada and the Caribbean, and turning out for his Sydney club side Sutherland.
However, in recent weeks he has made gradual moves to rehabilitate his public image and joined his former Australia team mates at training sessions.
BRAND POWER
Smith has also tested the waters to see how his brand power has fared in the wake of the incident, linking up with the local arm of Britains Vodafone Group to shoot an advertisement which played on his shame and hopes of redemption.
The commercial, and Smiths involvement in it, was criticised by some media pundits and generated mixed responses on social media.
Smith said he was getting paid for the campaign but also putting forward funds from it to Gotcha4Life, a local mens mental health charity.
The 29-year-old added that it had been tough at times watching Australia play from the sidelines and said he was determined to break back into the one-day side for the May 30-July 14 World Cup and the test team for the Ashes beyond that.
Im just moving forward day to day, doing what I need to do to prepare to hopefully get another opportunity to play for Australia and if thats the World Cup and Ashes, so be it, Smith told reporters at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
No doubt the English crowd will be incredibly hostile. Im ready for that if that happens.
Ill keep working hard and if I get that opportunity again, thatd be great.
Australia, led by Smiths replacement as captain Tim Paine, are tied 1-1 in a four-test series with India ahead of the third contest in Melbourne starting on Boxing Day.
Smith and Warners bans will be lifted at the end of March, with Bancrofts expiring on Dec. 29.  Agencies

Birth of Jesus brings joy, freedom to humanity - Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith
It is known that those visiting the birth place of Jesus in Bethlehem have to enter The Church of the Nativity through a narrow and short door, almost in a posture of stooping down.
History has it that those who built the Church, did not want any king, knight or a mighty one to go straight to the place of Jesus birth in a disrespectful manner but in a posture of humility, states Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith in a Christmas message.
The message: Such was the manner in which humanity considered and honoured Jesus as the most Holy Son of God to bring joy and freedom to humanity.
And yet this birth took place in the humblest of circumstances.
The Nativity story as it is, recounted by the Gospels reveals a series of paradoxes.
Kings, knights and nobles who came to the church on horseback, and wanted to visit the Grotto, could not do so, but needed to dismount their horses and eneter the Church stooping down through that door. Indeed, the place of the most noble birth of God among men had to be approached humbly by all. Besides, one had to use a narrow flight of steps to go down to what is considered to be the Manger or cave in which Jesus was born.
I quote Pope Francis:It speaks of the emperor, the governor, the high and mighty of those times; yet God does not make Himself present there. He appears not in the splendour of a royal palace, but in the poverty of a stable; not in pomp and show, but in simplicity of life; not in power, but in astonishing smallness. In order to meet Him, we need to go where He is. We need to bow down, to humble ourselves, to make ourselves small. The newborn Child challenges us. He calls us to leave behind fleeting illusions and to turn to what is essential, to renounce our insatiable cravings.
We do well to leave such things behind, in order to discover, in the simplicity of the divine Child, peace, joy and luminous meaning of life.(Homily of the Christmas Midnight Mass at the Vatican Basilica on December 24. 2016)
E#ven if that is so, yet, unfortunately, Christmas today, does not seem to be understood in relation to that deeply spiritual portrayal of Jesus, by the Gospels and the mission for which He was sent. The world has twisted Christmas into a fairy tale affair. After the Christmas night, like with Cinderella who is terrified at hearing the clock strike mid-night, realism of the challenges we face strike us with a bang. We discover that it was just another empty show and ened up having to sell old newspapers and empty bottles to make ends meet thereafter.
True enough, Christmas is a joyful moment but that joy comes more from being able to make others happy, especially those whose lives are constantly pushed to experience being abandoned, unknown and unwanted.
They are ones whose lives are constantly in the sight of Gods love. And so, we need to be sensitive to their sufferings and not let ourselves be enslaved by a rampant spirit of egoism that prevails in the market place.
Quoting Pope Francis once again: Today too, that same indifference can exist, whenever Christmas becomes a holiday with ourselves at the centre rather than Jesus; when the lights of shop windows push the life of God into the shadows; when we are enthused about gifts but indifferent to our neighbours in need.
This worldliness has kidnapped Christmas; we need to liberate it. (Homily at the Christmas mid night Mass at the Vatican Basilica on December 24, 2016)
Pathetically, in much of the world Christmas is lived without Christ at the Centre. Shops full of things that are pleasing tour eyes or to our taste buds; neon lights, reverberating music; gala dinners with wine, women and song, newspapers full of advertisements inviting us to a gluttonous Christmas celebration, marks, the season. Even in Sri Lanka hotels, advertize such dinners for people who wish to engage in frivolous orgies of eating and drinking.
It is a scandal to the poor. In most towns Santa Claus is an object of marketing. It has nothing to do with the figure of St. Nicholas, the 4th century n Holy Bishop of Myra, in Asia Minor who would make hundreds of children happy with gifts tied to good behavious especially during Christmas time. The Santa Claus of the market place sells goods but does njot help the poor.
It is in this light that we Christians need to make a conscious option not to let Christmas loose its original meaning and nobility. It is a time to enlarge our hearts to both welcome the Son of God born in the manger and the poor with untold expressions of respect and love for it is Jesus who comes to us in them.
Whatsoever you do to the least of my brothers, that you do unto me (Matthew 25: 45)
May I then, wish you all a happy and holy Christmas and n a joy filled New Year 2019!
Wishing you all Gods abundant blessings!
Yours devotedly in Christ

Carolling at Christmas
Carol singing during Advent and at Christmas is a great tradition worldwide. Whether it is pipe music played in the shops and in shopping centres or groups of singers or musicians basking at the roadside or in subways, these seasonal melodies render the festive spirit.
Carol is a medieval word of French or Anglo- Norman origin, believed to mean a circle dance, accompanied by singing. Carols commemorating the birth of Jesus were written in the 4th and 5th centuries, but they did not become associated with Christmas until the 13th century. Saint Francis of Assisi is often credited with incorporating upbeat Latin Hymns into Christmas services. In 1223 he also started Nativity plays in Italy. People in the plays sang the songs or Canticles that told the story of Jesus birth during the plays. These new carols spread to France, Germany and other European Countries.
Before carol singing in public became popular, there were sometimes official carol singers called waits because they only sang on Christmas Eve. These were bands of people led by local leaders who had the power, in the towns and villages, to take money from the public. Also at this time, orchestras and choirs were being set up in the cities of England and people wanted Christmas songs to sing. So carols, once again became popular. Many new carols such as Good King Wenceslaus were also written during the Victorian period.
New carols services were created and became popular, as did the custom of singing carols in the streets. The popularity of both these customs still continues.
The most famous type of carol service today is the Festival of nine lessons and carols, where carols and Bible readings tell the Christmas story. Such carol services are held all over the world. In Colombo, carol services are an important part of Christmas. Leading up to Christmas, the annual carol service of the Sri Lankan police, lead by the police band and choir, was a very popular event. St. Lucias Cathedral in Colombo, where we worshipped, held its well attended annual carol service in the Cathedral Square. In 1962, this event was combined with the highly successful Nativity Pageant.
In the 1950s and early 60s, the Colombo Chetty Young Mens Association choir took to the streets after midnight mass. This was our ethnic community choir. This tour by night of about 20 choristers, commenced after midnight mass. Together with the instrumentalists who accompanied the four vocal parts, the choir boarded the illuminated articulated truck with open sides. During the six hour tour, the carol truck did stop and sing two carols at each house of the community members, living in the two suburbs of Colombo. This joyous exercise continued until dawn on Christmas day. As children, we enjoyed this. It was a formidable undertaking, by the choirmaster. We had weekly rehearsals from September each year.
In the UK our experience of carolling matched the one we had in our homeland. We participated in the congregational carol singing in the churches in different parts of the UK I worked in. Of special significance was the Yorkshire Regional Health Authority carol service held at the York Minster, which is the main Cathedral in Yorkshire This Service of Nine Lessons was a fantastic event and I am privileged to be a part of, for eight to ten years of my tenure, working in the Health Service, in Yorkshire. The list of carols and music was sent in September to the lead chorister in each participating hospital.
Choristers from each hospital unit, rehearsed in four parts weekly. On the day (usually Wednesday before Christmas), all the choirs  a total of about 500 choristers - assembled at the York Minster at 1400hrs for a two hour joint rehearsal, conducted, at that time, by the retired organist of the Minster, Dr Francis Jackson. The choir did reconvene at 1900hrs in the Nave of York Minster, for the Service of Nine Lessons, which started at 1930hrs. This concert was indeed a phenomenal event.

Christmas Carols convey the Joyous message of the Birth of Jesus. Congregational Carol singing is a tradition that will continue, all over the world. In todays secular and consumerist society, where Christmas is focused on buying gifts, eating and drinking, Christmas Carols in streets and in shopping centres, will, at least in a small way, help to focus our minds, to the significance of the festive season.

CHRISTMAS BRINGS JOYS OF LIFE TO ALL
Christmas is the feast that all look forward to. The whole world seems to join the Christians in commemorating an obscure and humble young Jewish maiden, Mary of Nazareth, giving birth to a child she named Jesus. The apostle and disciple of Jesus, Matthew and Luke wrote their gospels nearly seventy years after this birth. Luke wrote that humble shepherds of Bethlehem were given the joyful news that the long-promised Messiah, the redeemer of the people has been born for them in their midst in a humble stable.
Matthew wrote that wise men from the East came seeking the new born King of the Jews and recognized in him the Christ  the Anointed Redeemer  and worshipped him, offering gold, frankincense and myrrh. Matthew in his Gospel underlines the indifference of the Jews to Jesus. When they are informed of Jesus birth they remain indifferent whereas Jesus royal messiahship is recognized by Gentiles, the non-Jewish people who are the first to adore him. Lukes Gospel says it is the poor Jewish shepherds who rejoiced at his birth and not the high priests and the powerful.
YOUNG MOTHER PONDERS
The evangelists seem to underline a universal paradigm that it is the wise and the humble who come to know the Messiah  the Christ, the Anointed One, the Saviour  who would identify himself as the Way, the Truth and the Life. To the keen observer it is clear that the wise though indeed very knowledgeable and learned yet prudently seek guidance to a more wholesome knowledge. They are never arrogant and intimidatory because of their depth of knowledge. The humble shepherds have a simplicity and an uncanny lucidity, insight and wisdom that elude the sophisticated, the clever and the worldly-wise who go after snob appeal. They make their way to Bethlehem and see for themselves what has been made known to them. They find reason to rejoice discovering the truth of what had been told them: a child wrapped in swaddling-clothes lying in a manger. The story of the shepherds amaze everyone. Meanwhile, Mary the young mother treasures what she heard and reflects on them in her heart. Mary already had heard from Gods messenger Gabriel that the child to be born of her would be great and people would know him as the Son of the Most High, that he would inherit the throne of his ancestor King David and that his kingdom will last forever.
Her husband Joseph too had been told that this child will save the people and turn them away from wrong-doing and make them a righteous, God-fearing people faithful to his commandments. Now the shepherds too had made known some profound truths about the Child; it was what they heard from the heavenly messengers. Mary needed to ponder on the meaning and effect of her childs birth the extraordinariness of which Gabriel had already told her. It was an amazing message and quite unexpected. Mary had simply believed what was communicated to her and consented to be the mother of Jesus by saying Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Let it be done to me according to your word surrendering to the divine will not knowing fully the implications. (Refer to Gospel of St. Matthew Ch. 1 vv 26-38).
Wouldnt every young mother who ponders while expecting and after the birth of a child think what her child would become A mother who has two boys aged 20 and 15 is very happy and contented; during her pregnancy she had entrusted her children to God and prayed that they grow to be good and intelligent children faithful to the divine commandments. She continues to pray incessantly for her children and her husband and is thankful that Gods providence has surrounded them. And there are so many mothers like her.
EVALUATING WORLDLY REALITY
The very nature of the human being carries with it a desire to know, to seek the truth and to attain to a sagacity and a wisdom that penetrates and perceives the meaning, the reality and purpose of the world he finds himself in. Christ directs his hearers to open their minds to understand well the worldly reality of human beings and material resources, their intermingling and relatedness and gauge their connection and true value and measure and live in uncomplicated harmony: Look at the lilies of the field; Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these (Matt. 6.29).
Jesus would state the meaning of his life in his reply to Pontius Pilate the Governor I am a king; my kingdom is not of this world. I came to bear witness to the truth. Whoever belongs to the truth, listens to my voice (Cf Matt. 18.36-38).
A king reigns and in Jesus kingdom he invites people not only to acknowledge him as Lord and Master but also to become his friends, brothers and sisters, to be partakers and sharerers of his own divine sonship, to reign with him by being a royal people, a royal priesthood offering praise and thanksgiving to God and a holy people relating to one another as brothers and sisters and governed by the law of love.
As people beset by human frailty and wounded by big and small sins, all of us fail to be good, wholesome and totally perfect in our individuality; we do not become holy by our own effort alone. Jesus promises to relate to each and everyone of us and be unfailingly united to us and be with us if we freely choose him and acknowledge him and strive to do Gods will just as he did as Son of God. Then he invites us to be one with him and shows himself to be our Lord and God whose love is boundless.
GODS WILL, HEAVENLY-JOY ON EARTH
Gods will is that men may get to know and love God and one another, respect and honour one another, accord each person his human dignity and rights, equality and freedom and live as brothers and sisters cooperating and collaborating with one another to enhance everyones life without causing any diminishment or denigration. Jesus teaches his followers to act and live according to the will of God, so that the will of God may be done on earth as it is in heaven. Jesus wants us to live our earthly life sharing his way of love so that the happiness and joy of heaven may become a reality on earth. There are people who already experience this joy.
Various types of Leaders have had an opaque understanding of the short life on earth and have attempted to create and make of society a more perfect one. To do so they have used their power to kill and eliminate hordes of other human beings in order to conquer and subdue people and establish their own way and order of life.
Leaders and rulers have plundered the lands, properties and valuable belongings of others. They have tried to make affluence, possession of lands, houses and various other amenities and power over others according to their will and fancy the measure of the highest value and importance. Unrestrained and undisciplined pursuit of earthly riches have distorted the meaning and falsified the understanding of what life is about and sown the seeds of injustice. The evils of various discriminations in society have vitiated and impaired the due development and progress of human beings and whole nations. The pursuers of power and riches have been themselves blind to other dimensions of life and their transcendent values.
SHARING ABUNDANCE OF LIFE
It is to give a right understanding of riches that Jesus tells his disciples, How difficult it is for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven. It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven (Matt. 19.23-24). What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his life (Mark 8.36). Very often rich people are enslaved by their riches; they are not free.
They are not attracted by the goodness, nobility and the virtues of others; they are attracted or rather distracted by money, physical delight and gratification. Rather than possessing wealth the rich are possessed by their riches. The pleasures, even illicit and immoral pleasures that money can procure become the measure and end of life. Their riches dictate, subvert and overturn the human values by which they should live.
At Christmas the tradition of sharing enkindles afresh the recognition of our fraternity with the poor and disadvantaged. It strives to lessen to some extent the harm and defacement we have done to our own humanity. Christmas should bring all mankind to rethink the way and the values by which we should live our lives, rethink the way we relate to fellow human beings as we are all equal before God.
Christmas should make us rethink about our attitude to money and to our material possessions and how we dispose of our material resources and exercise power over others. Christmas should make us think of the way we bring a moment of joy and a measure of justice and peace to the lives of our fellow men. Genuine celebration of the birth of Christ should make our lives and that of our fellowmen truly more abundant and joyful than it is now.

Christmas brings new hopes, aspirations - President
The expectation of Christmas is a promise of a new life, a new birth. Christmas is a season where the message of Jesus, on peace and reconciliation, reverberates throughout the world. The people around the world celebrate Christmas to mark the arrival of Jesus, to enlighten the masses who were in darkness and light up the world with new hopes and aspirations for a joyful future, states President Maithripala Sirisena in his Christmas message.
The message: The incredible night on which the miraculous star in the Eastern horizon was seen by the prophets, when it stood stationary in the sky above the shepherds hut, in which the child Jesus was born into this world, was the night the messenger of the eternal message of unreserved love was born. Jesus uttered words filled with love and kindness throughout his life.
He spoke to ordinary people such as fishermen, carpenters and farmers. You have been taught to seek an eye for an eye for revenge, or hit out with a boulder if you are hit with a stone.
Yet I ask thee to show mercy to the enemy, to spread love for those who hate you or make you suffer with torture, Jesus urged. Christmas is a season which brings forth the wholesome goodness of a great visionary.
It is the time to fulfill his aspirations. Jesus preached that one will not be able to enter Heaven unless they become innocent like children. May those verses preached for the sake of humanity, filled with kindness for the betterment of the world, be spread throughout villages and cities in this Christmas season!
May the values of great humanity, reconciliation, and generosity preached by Jesus, be spread around the world this Christmas!
I offer my heartfelt best wishes for a joyful Christmas, to every Christian.

CHRISTMAS: A DAWN OF RENEWED HOPE
Christians ardently believe that Jesus, known as the Messiah (meaning the anointed or the chosen one), was born to a virgin mother named Mary. This glorious Christmas story took its origin based on the gospels of Luke and Matthew. According to these gospels, Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ was born in Bethlehem to mother Mary and his foster father, Joseph.
According to popular tradition, he is said to be born in a stable; but as per the Biblical accounts, he was born and laid in a manger. It is believed that this stable and manger are situated in a place called the Grotto of the Nativity, where Jesus is said to have been born (it is still found within the crypt underneath the main altar of the church of the Nativity in Bethlehem).
An angel had appeared to the shepherds who were living out in the fields near this stable and had announced the birth of Jesus.
The angel had further said to them that there will be a baby swaddled in cloths and lying in a manger and that he shall be the sign. Thereafter, they had left to see baby Jesus and they are believed to be the first group to witness baby Jesus. Christians believe that the prophecy which had been made many years before the birth of Christ was fulfilled with Jesuss birth.
In a stable, having been born to a poor family, the son of Almighty God came to us in human form with the noble intention of delivering the message of truth to mankind. Christians consider that the arrival of the son of God into a world full of sinful humans is an act of showing divine love.
Based on the belief that baby Jesus was born on the December 25, the said date has been named Christmas day and every year it is celebrated all over the world by Christians.
Christians living in a large number of countries in the world consider that Christmas is the most significant day of the year and thus it is celebrated annually in a grand manner. At present, Christmas has been commercialised to a great extent and we need to realise the true value of Christmas.
Christmas, the celebration of the birth of baby Jesus, has evolved into a splendid ceremony with the incorporation of a number of other aspects. Dealing with the special observances and terms connected with Christmas while having an understanding about them will be of great help to bring out the true meaning of Christmas.
Christmas
The English term, Christmas is shortened from the words, Christs Mass, which has derived from the Old English, Cristesmsse.
The word, Christmas is also written as X-mas. The appearance of letter X can be seen as an influence of the Greek language as X is the initial letter of the Greek term which stands for the word Christ. Therefore, it can be said that the abbreviation, Xmas has also come into being with reference to Christmas. According to sources, it becomes evident that this abbreviation has been used since the mid-1500s.
Christmas trees
The first artificial Christmas trees were created in Germany. It is recorded that it was made in the 19th century. These were made using goose feathers which were dyed green. Goose feathers were fixed into a structure in the shape of a tree which had been made using things such as wires.
Before artificial trees were introduced by the Germans, evergreen conifers had been decorated during Christmas. The earliest instance of decorating such a plant was recorded from the town Riga in Latvia. That was around the year 1510.
Earlier, Christmas trees made using evergreen conifers were decorated using fruit such as apple and grapes. Other than fruit, items of confectionary were also used for that purpose. Later on, candles were used to adorn Christmas trees and presently electric bulbs have taken their places to make the trees more beautiful.
People of Poland use artificial spiders and cobwebs to decorate Christmas trees. According to a folk story in that country, the swaddling cloth of baby Jesus had been woven by spiders. Due to this reason, Polanders consider spiders as a symbol of prosperity.
Even though artificial Christmas trees have been introduced, natural Christmas trees are cultivated using special types of trees and harvested even at present.
It is said that around 30 to 35 million natural Christmas trees are sold during each Christmas in America alone. To meet this demand, Christmas tree cultivation farms have been established in America. There are around 21,000 farms for growing Christmas trees.
Greeting cards
Another thing which people are in the habit of doing during Christmas season is sending Christmas greeting cards. The first Christmas card was designed in 1843. According to history, a British Civil Officer named Sir Henry Cole had taken the initiative to do that. After designing the first Christmas card, he started to create Christmas greeting cards just for the purpose of selling.
The act of sending greetings to relatives and friends through Christmas Cards has become an aspect of American culture since 1875.
Sending Christmas greeting cards has now become a crucial element within American culture. That becomes clearly evident when looking into the sales and the income gained by selling Christmas Cards in the United States of America.
Carols
Christmas songs render the splendour of Christmas an almost tangible rhythm which can be felt by our hearts. Usually, these gleeful renditions are given on stages made in front of churches and some people sing those songs while parading on open vehicles along the streets. It is said that Christmas songs became extremely popular during the 19th centenary. These are also known as Christmas carols by many people.
There are records which suggest that the first singing of Christmas songs took place in Rome. It has been mentioned that those songs were sung in the fourth century. Those were written by St. Ambrose, Bishop of Milan.
The Christmas carols sung during the past were neither melodious nor harmonious and were different from the ones we listen today. It is said that those were written incorporating profound excerpts from Christian Theology. Therefore, their diction was inharmonious. No clear evidence is found as to how those recitals had been presented.
Christmas stamps
Issuing postage stamps on the theme of Christmas was quite customary in most of the countries. Those postage stamps issued for Christmas are specially used to send Christmas greeting cards. It is said that the first postage stamp for Christmas had been issued in Canada in 1898.
Father Christmas
We cannot even imagine a Christmas without Father Christmas or Santa Claus. The character of present Santa Claus originates from Bishop St. Nicholas who lived in Myra, Greece in fourth century. When considering various legends about the bishop, St. Nicholas it transpires that bishop, St. Nicholas derived great pleasure in giving away gifts to needy children.
In some other stories, it is said that an ordinary person named Nicholas had been in the habit of distributing gifts among children of poor families during the Christmas season. He had spent his personal wealth for that purpose. He did not let the society know that he was the one who had been distributing gifts among the poor.
He had acquired the habit of discreetly entering houses through the chimney during the night and to keep gifts by the sides of children. Later on, he had been canonised as a saint. It is said that he was known as Saint Nicholas thereafter.
It is clear that the character of Santa Claus had originated based on St. Nicholas.
The character of modern Santa Claus has been created mainly by artists and authors of childrens storybooks. The American cartoonist named Thomas Nast is one of the prominent figures who created the modern version of Santa Claus in the 1980s. In this regard, it is also worth mentioning the American writer, L. Frank Baum, who wrote The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus in 1902 based on the character of Santa Claus.
People have different opinions on where Santa Claus lives but the majority believes that Santa Claus and his wife, Mrs. Claus, live in the North Pole. Throughout the year, two of them are believed to be engaged in the act of making two lists of children in the world, categorising them as good and bad. According to the said list, Santa Claus is the one who prepares presents.
So, he is said to be busy throughout the year. His group of elves assists Santa Claus to make the presents required. Santa Claus delivers the gifts he prepared for children on Christmas evening by riding his sleigh pulled by eight flying reindeer. This is the famous legend existed.
Letters to Santa Claus
Little girls and boys are used to sending letters to Santa Claus during the Christmas season. Santa Claus becomes extremely busy during the season of Christmas. So the letters addressed to him should be sent as soon as possible. Otherwise, it is said that he can hardly reply to you. Once Santa Claus sending a mail through British Royal Mail and this is what he had written in that regard.
Dear boys and girls,
Christmas is a very exciting but busy time for me: the elves are making toys, the reindeer are practising their sleigh runs, and Im busy preparing my list of whos been good this year. I want you to inform me your preferred present to have the soonest possible.
And in between, I will try to reply to as many of you as possible. Please send your letters to Santa/Father Christmas, Santas Grotto, Reindeer land. Please send your letters by December 9. I am looking forward to delivering your presents on Christmas Evening. Make sure you remember my mince pie and Rudolphs carrot..
Measures have been taken in many countries to collect the letters addressed to Santa Claus and to reply to them through postal services. It is said that the replies for letters sent to Santa Claus are sent by employees of the postal services of the respective countries or a board of volunteers. Reports say that in 2014 six hundred thousand letters addressed to Santa Claus had been received to British Royal Mail.
There are three towns which have been named as Santa Claus in the USA. Those towns are situated in Georgia, Arizona, and Indiana. However, nothing has ever been reported about Santa Claus living in any of those towns.
When having a closer look at the outward splendour associated with this hallowed festival, it becomes clear that it is merely clever of means of keeping the spirits of children up and actively engaging them in the celebration of Christmas with great enthusiasm and cheerfulness while the grown-ups explore the true meaning of Christmas through spiritual discipline.
Not only Sri Lankan Christians but also some members of the Buddhist community take part in Christmas celebrations. Especially during Christmas celebrations at government institutions all the Christians, Buddhists, Hindus, and Islamic devotees come forward, help one another and work in unison during such religious activities of fellow Christians showing reconciliation and unity among the Sri Lankan community.
Sri Lanka Police, as a significant government institution which celebrates main religious festivals ceremoniously, has taken measures to celebrate Christmas decorously this year as well with the participation of Archbishop Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith under the leadership of the Inspector General of Police on 21st evening at Police Grounds, Bambalapitiya.
While taking a determined effort to bring about peace and love expressed through the message delivered to this world by the Prince of Peace, we hope that the world will be filled with peace and prosperity and wish all the people of the world a Merry Christmas!

Christmas: The Festival of Light
If we ask any non Christian to name one festival so closely linked to a particular religion and which has now become universal; the answer would he Christmas without an:, competition. For Christians, Christmas is but one of several feasts they observe throughout the year and which are sometimes more significant than this feast in December which has become more vibrant due to commercial purposes in the modern times. Why do people celebrate Christmas A straightforward answer to this question is that Christmas is the birthday of Christ. Does this mean that Jesus was born on the 25th December No, it does not mean that f le was born on December 25th. The truth is that nobody knows the day on which Jesus was horn. Then one may ask the reason for celebrating Christmas on the 25th December every year. This is a complex and complicated story, which needs to be investigated to have a sound understanding of Christmas.
According to the Bible
It is clear that the early Christians did not celebrate the birthday of Christ. In the New, Testament of the Bible, apart from the records of the birth of Christ we do not find any record of these early followers of Jesus Christ celebrating the birthday of their leader and master. This is not something surprising as Jesus was a Jew and most of the early followers of Jesus were Jewish people. Fut Jews birthdays were not very important as for the Romans or Greeks. In this background the only clear birthday recorded in the New Testament is the birthday celebration of King Herod, after which event John the Baptist, the forerunner of Jesus. was beheaded.
When Christmas began to be celebrated on the 25th December this festival became meanin2ful to people as it was able to enrich the birth of Christ by absorbing the meaningful festivals already celebrated in society. This is the core factor that has made Christmas so important for people all over the world. In this particular context it is clear that Christmas is not a mere birthday part) for Jesus Christ. It is a festival of light and life. This is clear in the following Bible verses taken from the traditional Bible passage read for Christmas from St. John's Gospel (St. John I .1-14). In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him. and without him not one thin2 came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people.
The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it..... Let us see how Christmas became a rich mixture or a colourful tapestry thouh many sociological, religious and ethical influences.
The Historical landscape
According to the generally accepted history of the Christian Church Christmas has been celebrated on 25th December 354CE. Before this time, and after the New Testament period, this festival was celebrated on 6th January
It is necessary to understand the context of January 6th to comprehend the festival that was celebrated on this date. In pagan antiquity 6th January was the east of Dionysus the Greek vegetarian god of wine. It was the belief of the followers of this god that by transforming water into wine HIV god revealed his divine power.
Very probably, when the early Christians gradually initiated the celebration of the incarnation or God in Jesus the established legend of Dionysus, would have created a significant ground to make the nativity of Jesus effective and meaning. This is clear in the way in which they celebrated the Epiphany on the 6th January by commemorating the feast of the power of revelation of their God in a way by displacing die least of We epiphany of Dionysus.
On the other hand the gradual development of 25th December as the nativity of Christ from the mid 4th century cannot be understood without a sound understanding of the mid winter festivals of the ancient world. These festivals were especially prominent in ancient Babylon and Egypt. At the same time Germanic fertility festivals were also held during this winter season. Along with the winter festivals the birth of the sun god was particularly associated with 25th December. For instance, the births of the ancient sun god Attis in Phrygia and the Persian sun god Mithras were celebrated on December 25th. The Roman Festival of Saturn (Saturnalia), the god of peace and plenty, was from 17th to 24th December. These festivals were held with great festivity along with public gatherings, exchange of gifts and candles, etc.
Cultural Influences
Apart from these origins there are many other customs and traditions from other cultures which are embedded with Christmas. For instance the custom of decorating homes and altars with evergreen leaves of holly and mistletoe during the Christmas season came from the ancient Celtic culture of the British Isles where they revered all green plants as important symbols of fertility.
The tradition of calling Christmas Yule tide in many countries is derived from an ancient ritual of burning Yule logs as part of a pagan ceremony associated with vegetation and fire. This community act was performed with the expectation of magical and spiritual powers. It is believed that the widely venerated Saint Francis of Assisi introduced the practice or making cribs by making a model of the scenes of nativity to re-enact the birth of Christ in order to bring spiritual revival to the laity. As is common knowledge, singing is part and parcel of a 1 all cultures of the world.
In the background of this cultural universal singing of this carols for Christmas appeared in the Middle Ages and by the 14th century this custom became part of the religious observances of the birth of Christ. Apart From these customs, rituals and ceremonies there are many other traditions such as the Christmas tree d the observance of saint days that are intertwined with the celebration of Christmas.
What Christmas means for us today
Christmas has the power to bring many cultures, traditions and symbols together to uplift humanity to divinity and bring down the divine to humanity. It is the responsibility of Christians and others concerned to make this festival meaningful by adsorbing all life affirming and light ueneratin2 festivals and activities to this festival. We can see that already this has happened commercially. It is our responsibility to make this happen ethically, morally, and spiritually.
The necessity for this responsibility springs up in the post war contexts of many countries as there are people who still exist in bleak Mc threatening situations. Here the message of Christmas is not to look into their caste, code. class, ethnicity or religion, but to accept and honour them by respecting them and making them understand that their liberation and redemption is tied up with the salvation of whole humanity.
While celebrations will continue this Christmas as well, let us direct our minds to understand those that are unable to celebrate not religiously but in any practical manner according to hardship. non recognition. discrimination, fear and loneliness. 1 he message of Clod who becomes a human being in order to know humanity and to save humanity cannot resonate at all if we are unable to bring this joyful news of light and life into the lives of the above. Let this he a season where we share this light and life with them and many others. May the peace of Christmas be with you all..

Christmas is Gods Best for Me is Better Than My Best for Me
Boxing Day When Gods Best, Breaks Me Out of My Small Box
Little Lord Jesus Infant King, You knew that Father offered the next best to heaven - Mother's Womb  when you, Creator God, had to come in feeble form, He also emphasized sanctity of womb life, marriage and family. In an age, family is under assault, it is refreshing and instructive to reflect on the Holy Family.
Midnight Friend  Joseph
Anyone can have a dark night of the soul (DNS). So you need a midnight friend. (MF). Even if you are out of contact for some time, he is there for you. She will not judge you but help you. Even when you get a friend calling on your door at midnight for needy bread (physical bread, counsel, comfort, shelter, asylum), you can refer for help from your Midnight Friend. Everyone flips, at an inconvenient hour. So be merciful. We need midnight friend and please be one yourself. When people look blackest, MF will arise with the silver streak anointing an angel dispatched to avert crisis, stop suicide. Lets commit ourselves to be a midnight friend like Joseph.
Jesus in Marys Womb  His Sociological Identificational Parade
Lets imagine the Infant King in Virgin Marys womb, taking travel thru war ravaged terrain  further ravaged by mans injustice to man.
 Little Lord Jesus Infant King, You knew that Father offered the next best to heaven - Mother's Womb - sanctity of womb life.
 Jesus in Marys womb was conceived in Nazareth despised by fellow Galileans. He knew contempt, suspicion, put down, innuendos even from Mothers womb.
 Jesus in Marys womb passed thru Nain helping widow and orphan, healing lepers
 Jesus in Marys womb passed thru Samaria - alienated, perhaps stopping at ancestor Jacobs well to quench their thirst, where He would meet Samaritan woman - outcast.
 Jesus in Marys womb passed thru Jericho which He would on His way to crucifixion and meet Zaccheus.
Joseph Was No Toad in the Well
 Joseph was only an unknown carpenter - for many, the small area of their expertise becomes their ceiling and fence
 Not so for Joseph  he understood, greatness will come by aligning to Gods promotion
 Let not your earthly labour and achievement box you out of Gods Best Christmas
 Joseph did not fear to break out of the Galilean and Nazareth mould  as Peter was on Temptation and Trial night
 When trial, testing, barbs and brickbats came, Joseph said  Gods anvil and hammer will enlarge my vessel and my scope. Many like expansion but try to avoid the process of anvil and hammer.
Joseph Under Stress said  When the Going Gets Tough, Tough Get Going
 Was willing to let go vengeance and forgive Mary if that was the case  he didnt insist on his right
 His obedience was instant  they both heard God and obeyed - He protected Mary
 Angel quoted Gods word  Joseph knew Isaiah prophecy
 Joseph cultivated the habit of hearing heaven  way for prosperity  this saved Baby Jesus life.
 He kept the faith  Dedicated Jesus on the 8th day with offering
 He was richly provided gold, myrrh and frankincense
Joseph  Sheet Anchor Role in Holy Family
 Joseph is one who has understood that his destiny is to serve another who has a great call from God. Not that Josephs call was less but different and supplementary. All cannot be in the lead role.
 Joseph became the team member who got the most difficult parts of Project Immanuel. His call was, Do whatever need be for King to be born. Shift the straw. Clean up the dung. Wash the food trough. Find the bandages. There went Josephs best robe. Be midwife for one night with no training. One moment great elation that three kings came to worship the babe and in the next, great danger that Herod will kill  fleeing in the night.
Most Menial Work to Make others to shine
 Joseph understands that on his toil the gifts of others shine. In the fellow-ship of HMS Apeksha, Joseph is on lower deck pulling the oars (work of Galley slaves). Singers are high on the sails for all to see. Others reach down and save the sinking taking them into life boats. Yet others man the guns to keep the enemy at bay. Some read maps and keep the ship on course. In fact the whole profession is called sailors though Joy-serfs are indispensable. Josephs are Joy-serfs who toil for others to shine. Their joy is anothers trophy. Trainers, coach, teachers all have the ministry of Joseph.
 Joseph demonstrates the ministry of the shepherd. Shepherd has to lead and follow and be on a side when there is danger that sheep may fall of the ledge. Shepherd leads until he gets them to new pasture. He follows them when sheep have to move thru known.
Let us remember and emulate Joseph at this time. Humble carpenter of Galilee who became world famous.

CHRISTMAS MESSAGES
Christmas message of the Catholic Bishops Conference - 2018
Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem which is Gods loving entry into human history. In this mystery of the Incarnation, God revealed to us the depths of his abounding love for humankind. God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, so that whosoever believes in him may not perish but may have eternal live (John 3:16)
"By his coming into our world, he wants us to share in the fullness of life which he alone can give (John 10/10). Thus, Jesus accompanies us and dwells with us. The name given to Jesus is Emmanuel, which means God with us. Hence, our celebration of Christmas cannot and should not be a mere recalling of a past event. It is an occasion to understand more deeply the real value of life and to witness to its fullness in the society we live.
"Christmas, therefore, reminds us of the need to invite Jesus into our lives, our families and our society. This seemingly simple birth in a stable in Bethlehem is a universal call towards conversion so that we would be more sensitive to the needs of others irrespective of various differences. Although Christmas is a joyful season, we need to be careful not to make it merely an external celebration. The true and inner joy of Christmas comes from a conversion of heart and accepting Jesus as the Lord and Saviour of our lives.
"While we engage in various forms of charitable activities during Christmas, we also have a duty to be more sensitive to the human needs and sufferings prevailing in our country. As Jesus was born among the poor, Christmas invites us to pay careful attention to the poor and be sensitive to the various forms of human needs and sufferings prevailing in our society.
"The question of poverty can be alleviated only by creating just economic structures. True development of the human beings can happen only in a society where there is mutual respect, justice and peace. A sincere commitment of everyone is needed in creating this environment in our country.
"Let us commit ourselves to change all that is not in keeping with Gods holy will in our midst by becoming agents of peace, harmony and reconciliation by forgetting the petty differences which hinder the common good.
"As we give thanks to God for the beautiful gift of Jesus, let us pray that all of us will be renewed by the Spirit to be His living witnesses.
"We wish all our faithful, our citizens and all men and women of goodwill a Blessed Christmas."
- Rt. Rev. Dr. J. Winston S. Fernando. SSS, President, Catholic Bishops Conference in Sri Lanka

COPE, COPA members to be increased
The Committee of Selection has decided to present a motion in Parliament to increase the number of members of the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) and Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE).
The Selection Committee headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya met at the Parliament Complex last Friday to decide on the appointment of the Parliamentary Committees. The Committees stood dissolved following the prorogation of Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena on October 27.
A member of the Selection Committee said the Chairmen of COPA and COPE are unlikely to be changed.
He said the proposal to increase the number of members in COPE, COPA and other committees such as the Public Finance Committee and Public Petitions Committee etc is to give a fair representation to all parties and groups in the current Parliament.
According to the new Standing Orders of Parliament, the COPE and COPA comprise of 16 members each, while the Public Petitions Committee and Public Finance Committee have 15 and 11 members respectively.
Prior to the prorogation, JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti headed the COPE and UPFA MP Lasantha Alagiyawanna headed the COPA.
He said the members of those Committees would be slightly changed as all the UPFA MPs are now in the Opposition.
The nominations for Parliamentary committees would be called by the Speaker from each party after the motion to increase the number of members gets the nod of the House.

Displaced persons protest dry ration misappropriation
A group of around 50 displaced people in Rajawela staged a protest within the Naula Divisional Secretariat premises complaining that there had been a misappropriation of dry rations.
The protest was staged yesterday by those who were displaced due to the construction of the Moragahakanda reservoir.
The protesters said that the dry rations were distributed by the Naula Divisional Secretariat with funds allocated by the Disaster Management Centre. They said that however, the rations were not properly distributed. They added that a lion share of the dry rations was distributed among the friends of the officers. During the protest, the protesters were engaged in heated arguments with public officers.
Disaster Management Centre Matale District Assistant Director Chaminda Amaraweera said that the centre allocated money for villagers in Rajawela and that the recipients were selected by the Naula Divisional Secretariat.
Naula Divisional Secretary Athma Dilukshi Jayaratne, who had attended a meeting in Matale at the time of the incident, said via phone that compensation was granted to farmers in Rajawela and Moragolla, whose paddy cultivations had been destroyed in the drought.
She added that the recipients had to meet several requirements: one being that they had had to be farmers, second that their cultivations should have been hindered by the drought, and the other being that the recipients shouldnt be government servants.
She said those who had met those requirements were the only ones granted compensation.

Drillship Aban Abraham prepares for post-drilling campaign
Pelican design class II drillship Aban Abraham berthed at the Hambantota International Port last week for a warm lay-up with full crew and equipment. The 219-metre vessel, which will be setting up its rig for a post-drilling campaign, will be stationed at the Port for a period of six months.
As per Sri Lanka Ports Authority and Flag requirements, a minimum crew would be on board whilst setting up operations are ongoing. The vessel will be under the supervision of local agents Hayleys Energy Services Lanka (Pvt) Ltd and its marine arm, Maritime Agencies (Pvt) Ltd (HayleysAdvantis Group Companies), during its stay at the port.
The drillships call is another milestone for Hambantota International Port, which has celebrated many firsts since its management came under HIPG, a subsidiary of the world-renowned port operator CMPort in December 2017. COO of HIPG Tissa Wickramasinghe, commenting on the new direction the port is moving in, said that whilst this is the first time Sri Lanka is offering such services, HIPG had the advantage of calling on the experience and expertise of their mother company in handling the operation.
We leveraged heavily on the global marine network access of CMPortand were supported by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, to make this operation a reality, he said.
The COO commended HIPGs commercial and marketing teams, who had worked tirelessly in securing the drillships call. The business had been won in a highly competitive market, amidst several other well-established ports in the region providing such services.
The market is well aware of more established ports and the fact that the Hambantota International Port was chosen despite this, clearly proves that we are benchmarking international standards. The hard work put in by the HIP team has paid off and we are now well positioned as a multipurpose port, he added.
The ports breakthrough in diversifying from traditional shipping activities to enabling Sri Lanka to maximize its strategic location has not gone unnoticed by the local shipping industry.
We are focused on introducing new businesses that would encourage and develop downstream marine related ancillary services at the Hambantota International Port, Wickramasinghe said.

Four day workshop for para athletes conducted successfully
International sports Federation for persons with Intellectual Disability (INAS) successfully conducted a four day workshop for the para athletes last week to focus on the forthcoming International meet in Brisbane in October 2018.
National Paralympic Committee (NPC) headed by Major General Rajitha Ampemohotty coordinated this workshop while INAS project Manager Michael Thomson and Psychologist Peter Hyninan conducted it at the Hotel Renuka, Kollupitiiya during the four days.
Sri Lankan doctors in the Psychology field also got a chance to take part this workshop and all of them with more than 50 Intellectual Disability para athletes had a very successful work shop said President of the National Paralympic committee Major General Rajitha Ampemohotty. He also added Sri Lanka has already obtained membership from INAS with 81 other countries.
This is a good chance for the Para athletes who will take part at the Brisbane athletic meet next year. We are going to start our preparation with this workshop and a ten months period is good enough for the athletes. They are Intellectual disability athletes and we have to focus very well. The participants who were at this workshop obtained a good knowledge of International law of the para players groupings according to their disabilities.
Anula de Costa the Sri Lankan coach who lives in Australia came forward to coordinate with the NPC and INAS to conduct this program while the Sport Ministry gave good support added NPC Chief.
During the next year Intellectual disability players meet in Brisbane, games like Athletics, Table Tennis, Basketball, Cricket, Cycling (indoor and outdoor road race), Horse Racing, Futsal Handball, Para Hockey, Rowing, Taekwondo, Tennis, Marathon and Half Marathon , Cross country race, and Indoor Athletics sports will be conducted and NPC already plan to select the players for a few games which have facilities here in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankan para athletes bagged 14 medals at the recently concluded Para Asian Games in Jakartha. NPC have long term and short term plans to get successful results from the Para athletes. Already two para athletes have won the most important Paralympic medals recently said the NPC chief.

Its that most magical time of the year - A Christmas tribute to my parents
It is indeed that most magical time of the year! I love Christmas, I just love Christmas. Even as I type these words I can feel a tingle going down my spine and Im smiling to myself, as I look forward to, what is to me the time of the year that is sheer magic and joy (though alas! most people are not that fortunate).
Just last night as I laid on my bed looking out at the night sky and the dragon fruit tree that grows outside our bedroom window, the thought popped into my head Would Santa Claus like to eat dragon fruit. Now you may think, that this is a ludicrous thought for someone who will be 59 in three months time, but I personally feel fortunate and privileged that I still believe in Santa Claus and flying reindeer, elves and gnomes, fairies and goblins, witches and wizards and all the magical elements that made up my childhood - thanks to my amazing as well as wonderful parents, who ensured that I had the most perfect childhood ever. As for Christmas, oh my goodness, even now I recall as though it was just yesterday the preparations that went into making Christmas in our home a magical experience and one which is still talked about by my cousins even today.
Growing up in the 60s and early 70s, we really did not have a lot. Even a loaf of bread was hard to come by and a tin of condensed milk was a luxury. Chocolates were unheard of and my mother had perfected the art of sewing a little girls dress and making it look pretty with just a square of fabric, which was literally all you could buy. Toys were hard to come by, but that did not matter in my case as all I wanted were my pets and we had an abundance of them. A moth-eaten teddy, my woolly dog, Lyka whose tail was forever on the verge of falling off and my rag doll, Bashana who was more rag than a doll, accompanied me wherever I went and of course the trail of dogs, cats and monkeys, hence the lack of toys did not really matter.
By the end of August, my mother would have this grim look on her face and my father would say Your mother is starting to plan Christmas and sure enough she was.
In those days, everything was made at home, nothing was bought. At least in our home, that was the case. Ham, corned beef, corned mutton, corned tongue (all of which Im ashamed to say I enjoyed at that time), stuffed dates and olives, Christmas biscuits, the Dutch and Portuguese sweets like botterletter, bola fiado, pofferjee, fugeti candied cadjunuts, Marzipan, potato toffee, coconut Rock, Cashew toffee, marshmellows, butterscotch sweets, boiled sweets in a myriad different colours, Christmas cakes and puddings, love cakes, breudher - my mothers recipe was for 1 kg of flour, you have to put 2 kg of butter, 2 kg of sugar and 50 egg yolks! I make this every year and everyone relishes it.
Christmas cake was mixed not in a bowl but in a baby bathtub as mummy would prepare the cake for everyone, including friends and family. Similarly, she made love cakes and all the other goodies. She was all her life a career woman (she worked till she was past 70), I really dont know how she had time and energy to do what she did. Her nutty fruity stuffing for the chicken and turkey is what I make every year and to date, I havent tasted anything better than that. Fruit slices, baked alaska, snowman pudding (again something I have never tasted outside our home); mummy would even make the snowmans hat, scarf and pipe by hand, ably assisted by my dad who remained a child at heart until his death.
Asparagus curry was prepared with scraped Murunga and cheese. The cheese was made at home, so was ice cream, sorbets and popsicles. Jelly was set in orange skins and oh! what a colourful sight those were. By September, after my mummy had prepared her famous lists, we would set off to the Latheefia Stores to buy all cake and pudding ingredients. My sister Tara would fastidiously shudder at the thought and would never accompany us.
Pettah and especially Gas Works street back in the 60s and 70s were simply a mess! Mummy would hitch her sari up so as not to tread on the muck all over. There was no proper drainage at that time and garbage, litter and the god know what else was just out on the road. No proper pavements either. We would arrive at the Latheefia Stores, my dad with a resigned look on his face, me all excited and hopping around, sampling everything the storekeeper gave me. My mum was treated with deference and awe. We were served tea and her order duly taken. Mrs. David please come back in 2 hours and everything will be ready she would be told. Now no mistakes please, make sure everything is there my mother would say (as though anyone would dare make a mistake with mummy), and off we would go for our other businesses and return to collect the ingredients, which were all beautifully packed and checked.
When it came to mixing the cake, everyone including our servants had to stir and make a wish. Once the fruits were mixed, it would be kept covered until the time reached for it to be baked. Similarly, we prepared the love cake and Christmas pudding.
Next, it was the time for Christmas cards. This too was a luxury. The UNICEF cards or any other Christmas card were hard to come by so what did we do We made them of course. What a wonderful time we had. Coloured crayons, pencils, chocolate wrappers, glazed papers, crepe papers, all went into our Christmas cards which were indeed a sight to behold. Daddy was very artistic and would make the most gorgeous Christmas cards. In one year, my best friend Yamuna Dissanayakes dad went overseas on a business trip and he brought a set of 24 coloured felt pens - riches indeed. Yamuna promptly brought them our home and told my dad Uncle Raj, lets make Christmas cards. At this point, I have to mention the fact that my dad was a magnet as far as children, animals and beggars were concerned. They all just flocked about him, so that my mum made sure that he had no extra money except one rupee for his cigarettes.  If your father has some money with him, it will be definitely given to the first person who spins him a hard-luck story and more so at Christmas time, she said. I still experience the thrill of making those Christmas cards, especially once the felt pens came along. Once, my sister Tara took one look at my attempts and told my father Surely you are not going to let her send those off, to which my father replied, Of course, they are beautiful. Now till today, I clearly remember those Christmas cards and they were downright hideous.
I could never draw or paint and my highest mark for Arts was 13, nevertheless, my father found them beautiful and they were mailed out to all our friends here and abroad.
Next, it was the time for Christmas shopping. Oh! the excitement and wondering of what to wear for this great outing as it always included a lunch at the Harbour Room and tea at the Pagodas. Mummy had somehow got me a pair of lace pantyhose and of course, I had to wear them for this all-important occasion. In those days, I never walked, I either ran or skipped and jumped up and down when excited. In fact, I still jump up and down when I am excited! After a few hectic hours of shopping, lunch at the Harbour Room where staple fare was lobster thermidor (I still recall it is an amazing taste) and tea at the Pagoda, where I had my fill of delicious curry puffs and cheese cake and other delicacies, we would go home, our car overflowing with our purchases.
Then came that long-awaited day - Christmas Eve. I still experience the excitement of that wonderful day and all the preparations we made. I had to have a new nightdress or pyjamas and even new hair ribbons, as Santa could not see me in last years nightdress. No way! Even Bashana was cleaned up for the occasion and had mummys lipstick smeared on her for good measure. Teddy and Lyka had new neck ribbons and so did the dogs and cats. A feast was set out for Santa as he would be hungry travelling the world distributing presents. Christmas and love cakes, sweets, biscuits, little sausage rolls (again made by mummy) and of course milk wine and ginger beer were all laid out for him.
On Christmas Eve, our first ritual was to attend the Methodist Church carol service and then dinner at my parents best friends home, Aunty Wivi and Uncle Nis. Aunty Wivi being a Chinese, dinner was always exotic and unusual and one we all looked forward to. After eating until the bursting point, playing games and singing Christmas carols, we would set off home to get ready for that all-important visitor Santa Claus! On tucking me into the bed, my mother would present me that most precious and unusual gifts. A Marzipan Christmas tree, which was decorated with multicoloured Marzipan baubles(all handmade by her), was in its own little Marzipan pot. Even while writing this, my eyes are filled with tears. How she had the time to do this, I dont know. Love and care that went into a marvellous work of art is unimaginable.
All through Christmas, this tree would be by my bedside table along with my Noddy lamp, Bashana, Teddy, Lyka and of course the dogs and cats who made it to my bedroom, along with myself would partake of it. I would try hard to keep awake to meet Santa but of course, that never happened. Next morning I would bounce out of bed; Joy to the World and Hark! the Herald Angels song would be blaring out. After all the hugs and kisses and general pandemonium with dogs and cats and budgies joining in the excitement, the first thing was to check if Santa had eaten the goodies laid out for him and of course he had. Next was a trip to the kitchen to wish the home staff and give them their presents. Next, I rush back and go into the garden to check Santas toadstools. Oh! what wonderful toadstools they were; in myriad colours, with stars and stripes and polka dots.
Years later, actually just before my mum died in 2005, it had rained the previous night and there were some white toadstools that had sprung up. I asked my mum why it was that we no longer saw toadstools in our garden when I was a child. Has it destroyed My mother looked at me strangely and said You mean you never knew Your father would go out in the early morning and paint them for you!. I was amazed, speechless and overcome with love for my wonderful father who did everything he could do to ensure that magic was part and parcel of his daughters daily life. Breakfast around the table was a family affair (actually in those days every meal was a family affair). Fried bread, bacon and eggs, sausages, fried tomatoes, potatoes, mushrooms, milk rice, plantains, Christmas cakes and puddings, love cake, etc. were all laid out on the breakfast table. Then, off we go to church and lustily sing all the Christmas carols, kiss everyone and wish them after the service and the trot back home for a non-traditional Indian lunch of Biriyani, made by my daddy! Then, I would go through all my presents, my sister would talk to her boyfriends while my energetic mother who was never ever got tired - she didnt know the meaning of the word, was adding the final touches to the gargantuan Christmas dinner.
We would all be dressed up by 7 pm and ready to welcome the family. All my mothers sisters, her brother and my cousins would troop in and oh! what a wonderful time we had. Daddy and Uncle Paul would dress up in fancy dresses and keep everyone amused with their antics. We would all perform skits, children would sing for the adults, pull bonbons (there were no televisions, notepads, CDs or any gadgetry that is so much a part of a childs life today), and of course, partake of all the delicacies my mum had prepared.
The dining table and sideboards literally groaned with food. My dad would always have a glass of wine with the home staff who would join in all the festivities, including the lighting of fireworks. Once the presents were opened and the oohs and ahs were made, we all had to articulate what we wanted to do in the new year - grownups included! My father would be told by one and all to diet and cut out sweets, my mother would be told to work less, I would be told to eat more (My mum would dress me up daily in a way that I would look plump) and so it would go on amidst much fun and laughter. I would unfailingly ask if I could wear makeup and pluck my eyebrows only to be told a very firm NO (even at age 8 I loved makeup and pretty dresses even though in those days they were hard to come by). Soon after midnight, everyone would leave replete with good food and laden with gifts. My mum and the staff would put away the leftover food, leaving the cleaning up for the next day. I would be on the bed next to my Marzipan tree, surrounded by my presents and wondering, just wondering would Santa Claus by any chance make another visit I believed in Santa till I was almost 15, and my parents encouraged it, till the day I opened my mums wardrobe and discovered all the contents of my letter to Santa in there. The penny dropped and oh! how I wept and wept and wept. My childhood dreams shattered. However, I bounced back and demanded that I be given Santa Claus nonetheless. And my parents complied.
The years have gone by, my wonderful, amazing parents, Priscilla(Senaratne) and Raj David-are no more, but the magic they created still lives on in the hearts and minds of my sister Tara and myself and my cousins as well. I still believe in fairies and Santa Claus and have not given up hope that one day soon I will spy them in my garden and racing through the night sky. Christmas carols blare out from the October 1, right through January. I try and produce as many of my mothers Christmas goodies as possible. When I feel tired, I tell myself that I am a working woman and all this is too much for me, a little voice inside my head says Your mother was a working woman too, she sewed and cooked for her children and her extended family and neighbours. I still jump up and down when excited and skip through the house and while shopping. I believe in magic and miracles and trying to help as many people and animals as possibly I can. In my beloved fathers words I will not pass this way again. As a tiny tot I was puzzled and told him but Daddy you pass this way all the time. He explained what this actually meant and admonished me never to pass by anyone who needed help!
Christmas at home was all about love, caring, sharing, magic and wonder. After all these years, I still believe in Magic. Happy Christmas everyone and I thank my parents for their amazing legacy. You will always live on in my heart and in my mind.

Jerusalems Santa Claus rides a camel
ISRAEL: Its a busy time of year for Santas worldwide. But for Jerusalems Mr. Claus, its been particularly hectic.
On Sunday, a restless crowd waited outside the shiny red door of his tinsel-lined home on Santa Claus Lane in Jerusalems Old City.
It was a familiar scene, one played out in thousands of malls and stores across the globe: children and parents eagerly seeking a little face time with the kindly red-suited gentleman.
Yet in Jerusalem, the traditional trappings of Christmas are hard to find, despite the Old Citys cobblestone streets being the backdrop to much of this holidays story. Even as thousands of Christian pilgrims make their way to the Holy Land this time of year, fairy lights, seasonal music, and an official Santa are all conspicuously absent.But not this year.
In July, Issa Kassissieh participated in the annual World Santa Claus Congress in Copenhagen and became a full-fledged certified Santa.
And with that, Jerusalem finally had its own St. Nick.
Kassissieh formally began his Santa duties on Dec. 1, and he has already greeted about 3,000 visitors with sparkling Santa stardust, imported candy canes and fake snow. When hes not working from home, hes out visiting the sick and others who cannot make it to him.
I am the only official Santa of the Holy Land, Kassissieh, 40, told The Washington Post on Monday. He pointed proudly to the neatly framed diplomas hanging on the wall above his special Santa desk, on which stands the manual typewriter he uses to respond to letters and requests he receives from fans all year round.
Kassissieh, an Arab Christian and former professional basketball player, is a well-known figure in Jerusalem. For years he had donned the red suit and white beard, finding fame as possibly the only Santa whose preferred mode of transport is a camel, as opposed to a reindeer.
But, taking his role very seriously, Kassissieh decided to become formally certified, attending Santa schools in Denver and in Michigan, as well as the Copenhagen congress. People think that anyone can just put on a red suit, but you also need to study the special spirit and the joy of Santa, he said. You also need to know how to bake cookies and carve wooden toys, apparently - all skills Kassissieh has mastered at special Santa workshops. Everything in his Santas House - a 700-year-old stone structure in a narrow alley that is decked with Christmas lights and a helpful sign directing visitors to Jerusalem, the North Pole, Santas House and Santas workshop - is handcrafted. He has even built a full-size Santa sleigh.
They also teach you how to talk to children, how to dress properly, to be clean and smell good, he said. You need to show happiness and welcome everyone - even those who are scared of you - with a smile.
But that is no easy feat in Jerusalem, where political and religious tensions can sour even the most genuine of gestures. In the past, the appearance of Christmas trees and other holiday decorations in malls and hotels has drawn protests from ultra-Orthodox Jews. Last week, a shopping mall in the southern Israeli coastal city of Ashdod sparked an uproar by erecting a Christmas tree in its central plaza.
One city council member from the ultra-Orthodox Shas party said it was intended to hurt anyone who identifies as Jewish. The mall pointed out that many Ashdod residents are immigrants from the former Soviet Union who celebrate Novy God, the civil new year, with a holiday tree, Haaretz reported.
My aim as Jerusalem Santa is to bring everyone together with peace and security, Kassissieh said.
