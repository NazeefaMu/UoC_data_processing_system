Contactless payments growing rapidly in SL
Contactless payments are rapidly growing in popularity across the world and in Sri Lanka too this segment is showing growth, said Visa Group Country Manager for India and South Asia, T.R. Ramachandran.
Speaking to Daily News Business, he said that in Sri Lanka, contactless payments only began rolling out in September 2016 and so far growth numbers across the first 12 months are growing rapidly.
Visa has already begun deploying contactless payment technology in Sri Lanka and expects to have 30% of the total number of terminals contactless enabled by the end of 2017.
The creative disruption brought about by digitalization of point-of-sales, tokenisation of transaction gateways and diversification of IoT-enabled payments will revolutionize the everyday buying and selling in Sri Lanka, Ramachandran said. He said that Visa will continue to expand contactless payment acceptance and facilitate new ways to pay and be paid for everyone, everywhere. The swift adaptation by Sri Lankans to contactless payments will also help to speed up governments drive towards creating a cashless society.
Contactless payments are designed to replace the use of cash in busy retail environments where speed and convenience are important, such as supermarkets, convenience stores, petrol stations and quick-service restaurants. He said that in India too this there has been a significant increase in digital payments penetration post demonetization. In the overall context, we look at what is known as personal consumption expenditure (PCE). The current penetration of digital payments of these expenditures is around 7 to 9%.
We are seeing a shift towards digital payments, quite dramatically, particularly in non-discretionary categories such as fuel and groceries, not only from metros and urban areas but also from tier II and tier III markets. Consumers are slowly but steadily embracing digital payments.
Its fair to say that post demonetization, India has perhaps leapfrogged three to four years and achieved what otherwise could have happened in 2020. In comparison with China, where 45% of China is already digitized, only 8% of India is digitized, which presents a huge potential to grow, Ramachandran said. Singapore is embracing contactless technology, with around one in every four transactions being made through this channel.
Hence India represents perhaps the single largest cash displacement opportunity in the planet.
Nearly 20-25 billion devices across the world by 2020 in some form of fashion will be connected and will be smart devices. India and Sri Lanka are countries where there is a level playing field with a domestic scheme and international schemes.
The size of the challenge and the opportunity in India is too large for one player to take on itself, whether it is Visa, RuPay, MasterCard, or any other firm.

Previous regime neglected Puttalam area
"A single rupee was not allocated by the Urban Development Ministry to the Puttalam division during the previous regime, but the ministry under President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe allocated enough funds to develop the area," North Western Provincial Councillor S.H.M. Niyas said.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony held to commence rehabilitation work on the Canal Road in the Puttalam town on September 16.
The ceremony was presided by SLMC Youth Organiser for Puttalam 4th division M.A.M.Askin. North Western Provincial Councillor S.H.M.Niyas participated in the ceremony as its Chief Guest.
Niyas said many development works were inaugurated and several others were going on in many parts of the Puttalam division. He said Urban Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem provided fund for them to mark the 17th commemoration of the SLMC founder, M. H. M. Ashraff. "We commenced many development schemes under the theme 'A Lonely tree in a thick forest'. Our national leader was very much insulted during the previous regime. We were treated as prisoners. Though our leader was a minister, many Muslim leaders who were supportive to the former President, prevented our leader from allocating a single rupee for development," he said. "But today the situation has changed. President Maithripala Sirisena received many votes from North East and Eastern part of Sri Lanka in the Presidential election with the support of our leader. Therefore, our leader is respected in Parliament," Niyas said. "We have declared this week for development work. Those who insulted our leader, admire him today for his service," he said.

Reduce frictions in trade to move into growth path
National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva urged the need to reduce frictions in trade in order to lubricate Sri Lankas trade with the rest of the world.
Noting that para tariffs and other protectionist taxes slow down growth of the export sector, the Minister emphasised the need to reduce frictions in trade, by formulating necessary trade reforms on an urgent basis.
We must be enlightened enough to be able to appreciate the fact that trade reforms are absolutely essential, Minister De Silva.
Stressing that the government has provided unprecedented tax holidays for those who were interested in investing in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, the Minister expressed hope that huge capital allocations given by the government would attract more foreign investors to the country.
He was speaking at the Sri Lanka - USA Business Council of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Seminar on US GSP programme, held at JAIC Hilton yesterday.
He further added that Sri Lanka needs to do different things to fulfill set targets in the economy and to be the hub of the Indian Ocean. To this end, it is essential to make structural changes and to move into the growth path, the Minister said.
The US GSP programme promotes economic growth in the developing world by providing duty free entry to the US market for the goods imported from beneficiary developing countries. As a GSP Plus beneficiary country, Sri Lanka may export over 3,500 different products to the US duty free. This is in addition to the 3,800 products that are duty free for all countries.
US companies and customers benefit from the GSP programme because the products that they purchase under GSP are exempted from import tariffs which can range between 2%-20% of the items cost.
US businesses imported US$ 18.9 billion worth of products under the GSP programme in 2016.

SL Customs National Single Window will reduce red tape
The National Single Window and the Trade Information Portal will reduce red tape and help to improve transparency said Australian High Commissions Deputy High Commissioner Tim Huggins.
Speaking at an event held at the Sri Lanka Customs to spell out details of the advantage of a single window concept to stakeholders, he said that the biggest benefit in this regard would be for the SME sector.
Unlike large companies who have special departments to iron out export-related issues, the SME sector doesnt have experience to deal in complex export-related issues and the single window would be an ideal opportunity for them to look at exporters in a broader term, Huggins said.
He also said that the economic vision for Sri Lanka for 2025 is very practical and they are eagerly following its implementation process.
We are also happy with some economic reforms and this, along with the launch of SriLankan Airlines direct flights between Colombo and Melbourne would also help to increase bilateral trade between the two countries, the Deputy High Commissioner said. It will certainly help to better the US one billion trade between the two countries.
World Bank Program Leader for growth and competitiveness for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Tatiana Nenova said that there are a lot of complications with regard to business start-ups and the National Single Window and the Trade Information Portal would help to iron out many issues.
She said that this would also help to improve the Ease of Doing Business index and also be a remedy for low FDI.
A National Single Window is a facility that allows all parties involved in trade and transport to lodge standardized information and documents with single-entry points to fulfil all import, export and transit-related regulatory requirements. A Trade Information Portal is a single source of information on all rules and regulations related to international trade transactions.
Over a series of consultations, the Sri Lankan trading community highlighted minimizing uncertainty in government policies and improving predictability and transparency as key priorities.
These challenges, they said, were exacerbated by a complex regulatory framework with a number of border control agencies operating under different mandates.

## Title: Sri Lanka not alone in injuries to players

Sri Lanka not alone in injuries to players
In the recently concluded series against India, the number of injuries sustained by Sri Lankan cricketers was highlighted in some sections of the media as partly responsible for contributing to the heavy defeats suffered by the national team. With the amount of international cricket that is being played today injuries to players have now become part and parcel of the sport and the role of the physiotherapist and others who form the support staff have become increasingly in demand.
Australian Steve Mount who was physio of the Sri Lanka team for five and half years from 2011 believes that Sri Lanka is not alone in battling with injuries to players.
Injuries are always multi-factorial very hard to pinpoint. In Sri Lanka cricket its well documented, they had a number of injuries to their fast bowlers, but its not only Sri Lanka who are suffering from this, Cricket Australia had fantastic resources a huge number of staff, the real cutting edge in terms of sports science but at the same time they had a number of issues with some of their important fast bowlers getting long term injuries as well, said Mount who was recently on holiday in Sri Lanka and caught up with some of our national cricketers during the Indian series.
Sri Lanka cricket injuries are not dissimilar to some of the other countries. We might not necessarily have the depth in our fast bowlers so it is highlighted a little bit more, but at the same time we need to strive and try to minimise those injuries as much as we can, he said.
Injuries in international cricket have overall increased and with all year around sport there is very little time off. Theres been a lot of talk about the introduction of T20 cricket the explosive nature of the game puts the batsman more at risk and what it also does to fast bowlers is from one week they go from bowling 20 overs in five T20 games to being asked to bowl 50-60 overs in a five-day Test - a big jump in their work load. With that comes the risk of injuries. What the body doesnt like is the big change chopping and changing from T20 to ODI to Test cricket. It all comes down to planning, some things you can control some we cant. Thats where the support staff comes in and gets the work load to a level where the body is ready to compete.
Mount said one of the biggest risk factors for injury is past injuries. Thats where things really need to start. From a young age you need to build strong resilient durable teenagers. It would hold them in better stead when they reach international cricket. Get 11-12 year-old kids in the gym early, not to carry heavy weights but how to move properly and teaching them basic movements. Soccer and touch football helps in agility in fielding and being able to move properly. A guy like (Tillakaratne) Dilshan who played lots of sports when he was young does fantastically well.
SUCCESS AND FAILURES
The period Mount was contracted with Sri Lanka Cricket was a time the national team enjoyed immense success as well as failures.
Five and a half years was a very successful period in Sri Lanka cricket which was great to be a part of, lots of good onfield memories, recalled Mount. The 2014 T20 World Cup win was fantastic especially after losing the one in 2012 in Colombo and knowing that some of those guys had played in four or five losing World Cup finals. That was a fantastic experience to be a part of. Winning the Test series away against England (2014) the first time Sri Lanka had done that and winning the ODIs and T20I and also the Australian series 12 months ago when they came here. Australia probably thought they were going to win and came fairly confident. To beat them 3-0 in such convincing fashion is great to be a part of.
The biggest disappointment that sticks on Mounts mind is Sri Lanka losing the World T20 final at home to the West Indies in 2012.
The 2012 World T20 final was obviously disappointing to lose and was quite hard on the players, we had a fantastic tournament, and we had a good chance to win, To be at home and see the Sri Lankan people how excited they were lining the streets on the way to the ground. That defeat obviously hit the players very hard and being part of the support staff, it was quite disappointing as well. That was from a team perspective, said Mount.
From a personal perspective its obviously hard when you see guys work very hard and they get injured. Its their livelihood but at the same time it can be very rewarding helping them through that process to get back on the park and see them doing very well.
FAST BOWLERS MOST INJURY PRONE
According to Mount the players who suffer from the most injuries and the more serious ones are the fast bowlers.
The injuries for most time out of the game is probably stress fractures in the lower back its very common in junior cricket and probably upto the age of 25, Sri Lanka fast bowlers have a very high risk of that, noted Mount. The most notable one in my time with the national team was Dushmantha Chameera in the England series last year. He got that lumbar stress fracture but luckily we picked it up very early and he got back for a Test against South Africa after 8-9 months.
It takes a bit of time to get his confidence up as well in coming back. You need to have that confidence in that body also after being out a long period of time. So you see him taking a while to get back to where he was. It could be a quite a debilitating injury.
Stress fractures in the ankles and feet are very common with fast bowlers. (Lasith) Malingas knee injury leading to the 2015 World Cup and Suranga Lakmal had a similar pain a couple of years before that which resulted in about six months out. Those are the two more common and long lasting injuries. Lasith had another stress fracture in the knee which is a bit more uncommon for fast bowlers but hes had that injury previously which affected his Test career. It was a difficult period for him. Its great to see him back now and hope he can have a longer career.
Bony stress fractures are quite common but there are also soft tissue injures and hamstring injuries that are also quite common. T20 cricket means high speed running not only fast bowlers but also the batsmen who suffer from soft tissue injuries. That is due to the fact that T20 and even ODI cricket as played now is really intense, he said.
HARD DECISION
Mount was contracted with SLC until August 2017 but when Tennis Australia offered him an opening it was an offer too good to miss out on.
I got a really good opportunity with Tennis Australia a chance to try something new, a new challenge and the lure of going home and base myself at Melbourne again. I wasnt sure when another opportunity like that would come up to be with the best male tennis players in Australia, said Mount. It was a hard decision. I loved my time in Sri Lanka.
Mount was working at the Australian Institute of Sports (AIS) based in Canberra when he applied for the job of physiotherapist for the Sri Lanka team and on the recommendation of the AIS and former Sri Lanka team physio Alex Kountouris he was signed up.
Like any job when you first come in you are meeting new people and it takes a few months to get settled. At the same time as soon as I arrived all the players the staff was extremely welcoming, very hospitable as most Sri Lankans tend to be. That helped a lot, said Mount. I had a couple of family members around at the time as well and that helped settle me in. The 5 years was always busy looking after the national team and also other national players injuries and rehab processes as well when I was with the team overseas. Overall it was a fantastic experience.
Currently I am enjoying my new job with Tennis Australia but I look fondly at my memories and I also met my Sri Lankan girl friend. Great to come back and see her and her family and catch up with the Sri Lankan guys in the Kandy team hotel, concluded Mount.

ABAF 2017 holds 'Building a Great Start-up' preview
Organisers of Sri Lanka's first Asian Business Angel Forum (ABAF) recently held a unique and valuable preview event, ahead of the main conference on October 11-12, 2017. Entitled 'Tete a tete with Startups in Sri Lanka', this exclusive opportunity to learn about building great start-ups took place on September 15, at the Kingsbury hotel, where a number of stellar speakers addressed the pressing issues of an audience made up of mostly of young entrepreneurs.
Giving advice at the workshop, on areas as diverse as growing across borders, when and how to scale up companies, valuation and funding options, as well as even tips on hiring staff, maintaining finances, most advantageous transport and marketing alternatives, fixing common mistakes by start-ups, etc., were three veteran entrepreneurs and well-respected e-commerce executives, Mekin Maheshwari, Amit Banda and Ramesh Shah.
Maheshwari, an early employee at Indian e-commerce giant Flipkart, who climbed the ranks to become the company's Chief People Officer before leaving the company in 2015, indicated that e-commerce companies were not always focused on creating assets, as was the case with more traditional companies. Rather their main goal was to grow customer volumes, with the company's valuation and profitability only becoming a concern later on.
Amit Banda, a former senior executive at both Reliance Communications and The Future Group, revealed that when Amazon was developing its Kindle online book reader, the team in charge of book sales at the company was worried that it could kill the market for paperbacks.
But they eventually decided to go ahead, because otherwise someone else would have beat them to market. This created a wholly new revenues stream for Amazon. Today, the reverse was coming into effect, where even though many people now bought books online, some e-commerce companies had identified omni-channel strategies to differentiate themselves, and opened up brick and mortar stores to adapt to different channels and their customers' behaviors.
Ramesh Shah, the Founder of the RK Group, a US$ 450 million-in-revenues textiles and e-commerce firm, commented that no matter what strategy one took for entry into India, the role of China played a big part. This was because China had fine-tuned shipping to a great degree, so much so that deliver of any small package from China to any part of India cost only INR 100 (approximately LKR 238.40). This meant that whoever wanted to compete in India had to always factor in this low shipping cost.
Apart of ABAF 2017, this highly interactive, half-day 'Tete a tete with Startups in Sri Lanka' workshop comprised more than 50 participants from about 40 companies, both start-ups and growing concerns. This diverse group, which represented sectors as varied as e-commerce, manufacturing, apparel, transportation, jewellery, marketing, data sciences, technology, etc., made full use of the speakers' experience, learning from not only anecdotes but also getting the personal input from the experts that was specific to their respective industries.
ABAF 2017 will welcome attendees from over 20 countries.
Along with a number of prominent business angels, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, policymakers, government officials and high net-worth individuals (HNIs), ABAF has also attracted interest from internationally renowned institutions such as the TVS Group, Proparco France, KfW Germany, DEG Germany, DGGF Netherlands, FMO Netherlands, Citibank Hong Kong, Blume Ventures india, Jungle Ventures Singapore, Gf in Mauritius, Cloudwell in Bangladesh, and Qlapa in Indonesia.
This is in addition to ABAF's already impressive speaker line-up, which features Dr. Clarence Tan, former Ambassador for Singularity University; Dr. Yehoshua (Shuki) Gleitman, Chairman of GIBF (Guangzhuo Israel Biotech Fund); Dr. Samson Tam, Chairman of the Hong Kong Business Angel Network (HKBAN); Dr. Mark Hon, Chairman of Business Angel Network South East Asia (BANSEA); David Chen, Co-founder of Angel Vest and Founding Chairman of Harvard Business School Alumni Angels of China; Brigitte Baumann Gervais, Founder and CEO of Go Beyond Early Stage Investing (Scotland); and Jayesh Parekh, Managing Partner at Jungle Ventures (Singapore). Rajan Anandan, VP for SEA and India at Google; Padmaja Ruparel, President of the Indian Angel Network; Pankaj Jain, Member of the Investment Committee at Wadi Accelerator (New York); Jordan Green, Chairman of ABAF/Melbourne Angels; and Sanchayan Chakraborty, Partner at Aavishkaar will also speak at the event. A detailed ABAF 2017 agenda and speaker line-up, as well as information on how to sign up for the conference, is available at www.abafsrilanka.com.
Kicking off on October 11 at the Cinnamon Lakeside hotel, ABAF this year will also encompass the sixth edition of Venture Engine, Sri Lankas trailblazing program for entrepreneurship acceleration and empowerment, which will be held on ABAF's first day.
A strategic partner for this years Venture Engine, the Lankan Angel Network is the host of ABAF 2017.
The Lankan Angel Network is Sri Lankas pioneering Business Angel Network with over 75 member investors who have collectively invested over Rs. 2 billion in 25 local start-ups, while Venture Engine is a product of a 2012 collaboration between BOVCapital and the Indian Angel Network.

All possible measures will be taken to help Uma Oya Project affected: Amaraweera
The Government will take all possible measures to help people affected by the Uma Oya Project, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing a meeting after he commissioned the Makuluella Drinking Water Supply Project on September 18.
Cancellation of the UMA Oya project as requested by certain parties is not a proper solution to the emerging problem. If the project is abandoned, it will take at least four years for the underground water level to return to normal. Already 80 percent of the project was completed. Only 20 percent remains to be completed. The Government will take all possible measures to help out and revive the livelihoods of the people fallen destitute due to the project, the Minister said.
Irrespective of whether the project is abandoned or not, it will take a long time for environmental conditions to return to the previous level, he said.
The Makuluella project was built by the Government to cater to the needs of the people in and around Bandarawela affected by the Uma Uya Project. The project cost Rs. 342 million and it will cater to 2,000 families in several villages including Makuluella and Karandegolla, he said.
A press release by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry said several other water projects were being implemented to resolve the drinking water problem of people affected by the Uma Oya Project. Work on the Greater Bandarawela Water Supply Project is due to commence this year. Deputy Minister Dr. Sudarshani Fernandopulle was present.

Angelo Mathews ruled out of first Test against Pakistan

Sri Lanka allrounderAngelo Mathewshas been ruled out of the first Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi later this month with a calf strain. He had sustained the injury during training on Tuesday, before undergoing scans on Wednesday.
SLC cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha confirmed Mathews' unavailability.
This is the latest in a long history of leg injuries for Mathews - the last 12 months having been particularly problematic. He had suffered a torn hamstring during Sri Lanka's tour of South Africa in January, and did international cricket again until July. He had also missed a tri-series in Zimbabwe late last year due to "multiple injuries" in his legs.
Given the recurrence of these injuries, Mathews' workload has been closely managed over the last few months. In fact, he was only required to deliver a few overs per game in the ODIs against India, and did not bowl at all in the Tests. Nevertheless, he finds himself unable to play again, just as Sri Lanka attempt to put the torrid series against India behind them. Mathews had been excellent during Sri Lanka's last Test series the UAE, in 2013/14, hitting 412 runs at an average of 103.
Sri Lanka's two-Test series against Pakistan begins on September 28 in Abu Dhabi. The second match will be a day/night Test, in Dubai.

Appeal to help Sri Lankan sisters who survived suicide attempt
The Sri Lankan Consulate in Dubai has appealed to community members and other philanthropists to support two sisters who survived a family suicide pact in Sharjah.
The sisters, identified as R.I., 17, and Y.I., 27, were found lying in a pool of blood while their parents and brother were found dead at a hotel apartment on August 29.
The younger sister told Gulf News that the financially broken family with no valid visas had decided to end their lives after they lost the 19-year-old boy due to lack of medical attention following an epileptic attack two days earlier.
The sisters and their mother, who later bled to death, had allegedly got their wrists slashed by the father who later jumped to his death.
On Monday, sources said the sisters, who had been under treatment at the Ebrahim Hamad Obaidalla Hospital in Ras Al Khaimah, have been shifted to the custody of Sharjah Police for further investigation since they are the only witnesses in the case.
Confirming this, the Sri Lankan Consulate said the mission has appealed to the community members to support the young women once they are out after the completion of investigation and legal formalities.
We would like to offer them all the support to repatriate them if they wish to go back to Sri Lanka, a spokesperson of the mission said.
We do not know if they wish to continue here since they have lived most of their lives here. In that case, we need to support them for their livelihood.
He said the mission would like the community members to offer their support directly to the sisters or through the Sri Lankan Welfare Association (Sahana), licensed by the Community Development Authority in Dubai.
We will also check with the Dubai Foundation for Women and Children about the possibility of sheltering the girls if needed, the spokesperson said.
He hoped that someone would offer a job to the elder sister so that the both can sustain their lives.
Upul Gamage, the president of Sahana, said the association had also spread the word about the need to support the two survivors. It looks like the family was living an isolated life. Nobody has come forward saying they knew them or they were family friends. We have no information from schools or teachers saying they knew the kids, Gamage said.
He said the association has a common fund which is limited. It is used mainly for some critically ill patients to pay part of their bills and for arranging their air tickets. We are requesting the community to support the girls.He added that the bodies of the deceased parents and son, kept in the police morgue, are likely to be buried here. - Gulf News

All types of cancers are on the rise in Sri Lanka. Annually, around 17,000 new cancer patients are detected by the local health system, National Cancer Control Programme Director and Consultant Community Physician Dr. Sudath Samaraweera said.
According to Dr. Samaraweera, the most common cancer among Sri Lankan women is breast cancer. Annually, around 2,500 new breast cancer patients are being detected.
The most common cancer among Sri Lankans is oral cancer. Some cancers can be prevented through vaccines such as HPV vaccine which is now being given to all schoolgirls of Grade Six as well as the vaccine for Hepatitis B.
Dr. Samaraweera was addressing the media workshop held in Colombo, yesterday.
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Nayana De Alwis said daily around seven new breast cancer patients are being detected in Sri Lanka and most of them are in the stages of three or four which cannot be cured. Most of them do not have a five-year survival period. The majority of breast cancer patients are over the age of 50. Early detection of breast cancer saves lives, he said.
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Suraj Perera said although a total of 29,457 new cancer patients have been registered last year, the actual number can be just over 18,000 because sometimes the same cancer patients are registered in two or three hospitals. Annually, between 12,000 and 13,000 persons die from cancer in Sri Lanka.
A total of 82.1 percent had cancer in every 100,000 people in Sri Lanka in 2010. Cancer is the second killer disease in Sri Lanka.
Consultant Dental Surgeon Dr. Prasanna Jayasekara said cancers related to the use of tobacco and arecanut have become common among Sri Lankan children since the recent past because of the use of tobacco and arecanut based products.

Around the world in 79 days: British cyclist smashes record
Paris: A British cyclist set a new world record Monday by travelling around the globe in 79 days -- beating the fictional exploits of Phileas Fogg by a day.
Scottish adventurer Mark Beaumont rode into Paris 78 days, 14 hours and 14 minutes after he set off from the French capital, smashing the previous record of 123 days for a round-the-world bike trip.
Arriving in evening rush hour traffic under light drizzle, the 34-year-old rode the last cobbled mile to the Arc de Triomphe with a 20-strong entourage on wheels, including a man in a top hat on a penny-farthing bicycle.
Some 50 supporters were at the monument to greet him, including his tearful wife Nicci and his daughters Harriet, four, and Willa, one. I doubt Ill ever do anything like it again, said Beaumont, describing the journey as definitely the longest two-and-a-half months of my life.
Bouncing his grinning one-year-old in his arms, Beaumont said the world record was an absolute dream come true. A Guinness World Records judge was on hand to present him with his two framed records -- he also beat the previous time for the farthest distance cycled in a month -- while he was still in the saddle. Beaumont had held the round-the-world record until 2009 when it was beaten by a New Zealander, leaving Beaumont to conclude he simply had to have the title back. AFP

Avril Lavigne rated 'most dangerous celebrity' online

Avril Lavigne is now the most dangerous celebrity to search for online, according to the cybersecurity company McAfee.
The singer-songwriter topped McAfee's Most Dangerous Celebrities study this year.
The report "reveals which celebrities generate the riskiest search results that could potentially expose their fans to malicious websites."
"Cybercriminals continue to use the fascination of consumers with celebrity culture to drive unsuspecting users to potentially malicious websites that can be used to install malware, steal personal information and even passwords," according to a statement from McAfee.
"The study, conducted by McAfee and now in its 11th year, highlights the dangers of clicking on suspicious links when searching for celebrity-focused content."
Lavigne dropped off the scene for a bit, starting in 2014 as she grappled withLyme disease.
'I thought I was dying,' Avril Lavigne says of Lyme disease fight
In August, she announced via social media that she would have some new music coming.
The search for Lavigne's music has contributed to her threat level.
"In today's digital world, we want the latest hit albums, videos, movies and more, immediately available on our devices," said Gary Davis, chief consumer security evangelist at McAfee.
"Consumers often prioritize their convenience over security by engaging in risky behavior like clicking on suspicious links that promise the latest content from celebrities. It's imperative that they slow down and consider the risks associated with searching for downloadable content. Thinking before clicking goes a long way to stay safe online."
According to McAfee, searching for "Avril Lavigne free mp3" results in a 22% chance of encountering a malicious site.
Lavigne is the first female music artist to rank no. 1 and replaced comedian Amy Schumer, who topped last year's list.
Singer Bruno Mars ranked second this year.

Bangladeshs Rubel denied entry to South Africa
Dhaka: Pace bowler Rubel Hossain was prevented from boarding a flight to South Africa with the Bangladesh tour squad after the airline claimed he did not have immigration clearance, officials said Tuesday.
"There is a new a provision that the passenger needs to have some sort of 'OK to Board' clearance from his ultimate destination," Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive officer Nizamuddin Chowdhury told AFP after Rubel, 27, was refused a boarding pass at Dhaka airport on Saturday.
"We are in touch with Cricket South Africa and hopefully the matter will be resolved soon. He will fly to South Africa on the first available flight once the matter is resolved," he said.
The rest of the 14-member Bangladesh squad has already arrived in South Africa ahead of the first Test starting at Potchefstroom on September 28.
The second and final Test will be played in Bloemfontein staring on October 6.
Rubel is now likely to miss the team's three-day warm-up match at Benoni near Johannesburg which begins on Thursday.
Chowdhury claimed Rubel's immigration clearance had nothing to do with a previous criminal allegation against the fast bowler.
In 2014, Rubel's former girlfriend and former actress Naznin Akter Happy had made a rape allegation against him, prompting police to detain him for several days.
A Dhaka court in May 2015 rejected the rape case against Rubel after police said there was no evidence against the bowler.
"I don't think it is the reason for him not to get the immigration clearance," said Chowdhury.
"His name is very common. Maybe someone else with the same name has some problem which created this problem," he said.
Rubel has taken 32 wickets from 24 Tests with one five-wicket haul.
Bangladesh will also play three one-day internationals and two Twenty20s during their month-long tour, their first to South Africa since 2008. AFP

Book Review: Who dares to buck the convention
Title: SamukkaAuthor: Jayani C. PinnawaleTranslated into English: Edmond Jayasuriya
In her third novel  Samukka, which now is translated into English, Jayani has attempted to tread on a new path to bring out a valued perspective to the attention of youth. The message is for youth to build character, while transcending from conventional thought, however deep and manifested, so as to build ones life, with an enlightened mind and thereby, acquire value for ones self and society. It is her long experience in serving in many capacities in the Sri Lanka Administrative service and exposure that prompted her to attempt to stress this point for serious consideration to the youth of today, for they play a positive role in society.
Samukka is a novel woven around a youth named Wickrama who deplores conventional way of life. He is the only child of Tittawelas, a wealthy aristocratic family living, in suburbs of Colombo. From his childhood Wickrama creates a secluded life of his own, He spends most of the time in his room reading and when in school, in the library.
Disillusioned youth
However, whenever he manages to get out of his house, he enjoys the company of youth in the neighborhood, namely Cyril, his sister Swarna, Jayasunmana and others.
Even though his mother never tolerated his association with these ordinary people, he enjoyed such comradeship, especially expressing his loving sentiments to Swarna. As time passes due to the close relationship with these friends, he gets to know about the youth struggle, that takes place during this period, a struggle where disillusioned youth took to arms and rebelled against authority. In this association with his friends, Wickrama realizes the active involvement of his dear friends, Cyril and Swarna.
Though his attempt to seek answers to the reasons of involvement is not forthcoming due to his close association he is more or less forced to join as a sympathizer.
Consequently, as time passes Wickrama, too gradually gets involved indirectly, when he supports them by agreeing to pass vital information to the rebel group about the Railway department, where his father is a key official in this department. This indirect involvement is well articulated by the writer to portray how Wickrama was dragged onto this movement by force of circumstances. Innocently done, Wickrama became an accessory and a later on a fugitive hounded by authorities.
Answers Sought
This was a natural phenomenon in Wickramas character as set out in the novel, as his intention was to find out about the reasons for the struggle, where he sought answers from his friends and the leader of the struggle, even proceeding further; to find how the youth could achieve their goal in undertaking such rebel activity.
We come to read as to how this situation came about as natural outcome, as Wickrama was keen and interested to know and understand due to his interest in reading on current affairs about political change, peoples struggles and on theories of socialism and Marxism.
As time passes this indirect involvement in the struggle resulted in his taking a bold step to leave his parents and home to meet the leader of the movement to know and understand the reasons for the struggle and how the youth could achieve their desired goal ultimately, as he always reasoned out in this way.
The writer shows how this youth dared to meet head-on with the active persons in the youth struggle when he left his home and parents to be with the rebelling youth; more interested to study the cause which he imbibed in his reading.
While being with them having realized the intricacies, danger and the resultant loss of life of youth he did his best to advise them to look at alternative paths rather than fight authorities Unfortunately such advice did not carry weight as the rebelling youth were too deeply involved and there was never any way to stop or turn back.
The involvement has its effects as Wickrama undergoes much anxiety and fear of capture and resulting effects. The resulting actions of the parents to save him is also unfolded in detail
However when the force of circumstances that came to pass with his parents' direct involvement with authorities in their intervention to get him out of the association with these youths, Wickrama was forced to return home.
He was disillusioned losing his friends especially Cyril and Sawrana one whom he dearly loved and expressed
After his return home, his parents send overseas for higher studies as they wanted him to be away from friends with no relationship with the youth movement. Such circumstances required him to agree to the arrangement made to proceed overseas. It had an impact on his life.
Post-struggle period
His belief of success to achieve three expectations, involvement in music, books and being with Swarna still manifested when he returned after his success in his higher studies in India. He compiled a book incorporating most of his beliefs, thoughts he acquired in his reading, experiences So we observe the post-struggle period with change of environment and beliefs forced Wickrama gradually and duly change his ways of life.
Samukka is a Publication of Sarasavi and available in all bookstores in both Sinhala and English Languages.

Book wizards season
We live in deeds, not years;
In thoughts, not breaths
In feelings,
not in figures of a dial
We should count time
by heart  throbs
He most lives
who thinks most  feels noblest acts the best
Colombo International Book Fair (CIBF) is held for the seventeenth consecutive year at the BMICH from September 15 to 24. The Sri Lanka Book Publishers Association began this national event at the Colombo Art Gallery Complex in 1999, and held it in the year 2000 too, before it began at BMICH to hold the exhibition in an international standard; Now, CIBF is considered as one of the Best Organized Book Exhibitions in the South-East Asia.
Essentially CIBF is more prominently an Exhibition of the Printed Book. Even the modern technology has brought in use of more improved devices in reading; still the printed book is the most convenient tool for reading.
You can read a book:
 Even travelling in a bus or train or even in an aero plane.
 Dont need or any device for reading.
 Dont need any skill except the reading ability.
 You can read a book seated, in a chair, lying on a bed or lying in an arm  chair.
 You can read a book as many pages your time permits, and read it afterwards  after few hours, few days, few weeks or few months  as you wish!
The Colombo International Book Fair is the most prominent event of the book world in Sri Lanka; Even the State Literary Festival (SLF) began in a national level in 1957, the impact of the SLF has not been the same compared to its beginning. Though the state Literary Festival is a National Festival of the book world in Sri Lanka, the participation has dropped drastically.
At this point the Colombo International Book Exhibition & Fair (CIBF) has won the hearts of the whole Sri Lankan enthusiastic general public. Last year the participants to the CIBF was more or less four hundred thousand. It has become a national literary event, that all Sri Lankans of Sinhala, Tamil and English Reading Public. They come to CIBF as in a annual Pilgrimage. The rural folk from far-far away village are the most prominent participants in the CIBF. When inquired they say that they do their savings the whole year long to buy books, they prefer.
Specially the rural women are the cream of this participants. Its like a annual pilgrimage to them.
There are some ill hearted newspaper headings in Sinhala journals which go as follows.
 CIBF become a Carnival for merry making to town folks.
 They wont buy books, nor read books, but instead prefer to eat the cheap noodle cups  etc and satisfied with that.
 Though some people buy books worth thousands of rupees, they are not reading them.
 And some people come to buy exercise books quite cheaper for year long use of their school going children.
 Its hard to find books they need, as always books on display are not arranged properly.
 The discounts or the reductions of prices of books are not equal.
 The exhibition stalls are too small to move on.
 In an International Book Exhibition, old books are sold which is not appropriate.
Some of these allegations are true to some extent; but the CIBF is an event organized solely by the private sector publishers in Sri Lanka, without any support from any government or any foreign collaboration. Its solely by the members of the Sri Lanka Book Publishers Association (SLBPA) who has taken the iniative of organizing this national event of pride.
CIBF has proved the capacity of the Sri Lankan Book Publishers Association to organize the most colourful and most visited annual book festival for seventeen consecutive years at the BMICH itself.
Altogether there are over four hundred book exhibition stalls which cover the majority of the Sri Lankan book publishers, leading book importers, leading book traders, including some foreign publishers.
CIBF has become a meeting centre for authors and writers, artists and designers of books, printers and all related to the book world including the reading public.
There are Seminars, Workshops, Various Children activities plus entertainment programmes.
The Colombo International Book Exhibition and Fair (CIBF) has developed more or less as a Trade Fair. A broad section of the Reading Public from various social starta visit the CIBF annually; But in Common it is the love of books. Hence the CIBF is essentially a festival of the printed book.

Britain picks authors for 2017
Paul Auster, Emily Fridlund, Mohsin Hamid, Fiona Mozley, George Saunders and Ali Smith are today announced as the six shortlisted authors for the 2017 Man Booker Prize for Fiction.
Their names were announced by 2017 Chair of judges, Lola, Baroness Young, at a press conference at the offices of Man Group, the prize sponsor.
The judges remarked that the novels, each in its own way, challenge and subtly shift our preconceptions  about the nature of love, about the experience of time, about questions of identity and even death.
The shortlist, which features three women and three men, covers a wide range of subjects, from the struggle of a family trying to retain its self-sufficiency in rural England to a love story between two refugees seeking to flee an unnamed city in the throes of civil war.
In the fourth year that the prize has been open to writers of any nationality, the shortlist is made up of two British, one British-Pakistani and three American writers.
Two novels from independent publishers, Faber & Faber and Bloomsbury, are shortlisted, alongside two from Penguin Random House imprint Hamish Hamilton and two from Hachette imprints, Weidenfeld & Nicolson and JM Originals.
Lola, Baroness Young comments:
With six unique and intrepid books that collectively push against the borders of convention, this years shortlist both acknowledges established authors and introduces new voices to the literary stage. Playful, sincere, unsettling, fierce: here is a group of novels grown from tradition but also radical and contemporary. The emotional, cultural, political and intellectual range of these books is remarkable, and the ways in which they challenge our thinking is a testament to the power of literature.
Ali Smith makes the Man Booker shortlist for the fourth time (she was previously shortlisted for Hotel World in 2001, The Accidental in 2005 and How to Be Both in 2014). This year also sees a repeat shortlisting for Mohsin Hamid, who made the list in 2007 with The Reluctant Fundamentalist.

aged 29, and one of two debut writers to make the list  the other being 38 year-old American Emily Fridlund with History of Wolves.
The other two American authors on the shortlist are Paul Auster and George Saunders. 4321 by Auster, who turned 70 this year, is the longest novel on the shortlist at 866 pages and, according to the author, took three and a half years, working 6 and a half days a week, to write.

Captains made the scapegoats for the sins of clubs
The much awaited verdict on the match fixing incident that took place in a Premier Tier B League cricket match between Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC early this year at the Surrey Village grounds, Magonna was reached by the Executive Committee of Sri Lanka Cricket based on the independent commission report and the recommendations of the tournament committee when they met on Saturday.
But to the astonishment of everyone the real culprits - the two clubs involved were allowed to go scot free with only a slap on the wrist (a fine of Rs. 500,000/-) for each of them and the two captains Chamara Silva of Panadura SC and Manoj Deshapriya of Kalutara PCC suspended from all cricket related activities for two years. In addition the players and coaches involved in the match were also meted a similar punishment for a period of one year.
The question that begs to be asked is why the same punishment as dished out to the two captains was not imposed on the two clubs as well Was it because the men who form the SLC hierarchy would lose the valuable votes these two clubs would bring at the next AGM which is due to be held in May 2018
There is also the argument that if a team has wronged it is the captain and the team that takes the rap. For instance when Sri Lanka was found to be well behind the required over rate in the recently concluded ODI series against India, it was the captain Upul Tharanga who was fined and banned for two matches by the ICC and not the Sri Lanka team. Thus decisions taken on the field are the responsibilities of the captain and his players. So in that aspect SLC is right in suspending the captain, players and coaches involved.
But then again this is a case related not to an instance like slow over rate but to match fixing, which is a bigger crime. The SLC has very deceitfully avoided the phrase match fixing and said the two teams have been found guilty of misconduct and not playing to the spirit of the game.
Fixing of matches neednt always involve money but in this instance it was done by the two clubs - one for their promotion to a higher Tier and the other to avoid relegation to a lower level of competition. Surely this was done after both teams had weighed the pros and cons of survival and come to a common understanding.
In such circumstances it is not the teams that are directly involved in the decision-making but the officials of the respective clubs under whose instructions the captains would have been asked to carry out the dirty deed.
The hilarious part is that Chamara Silva, the Panadura SC captain who refused to oblige the club officials and did not turn up for the match on the final day has been banned for two years while the officials who connived to fix the game have not received any punishment.
According to reports that appear in the media these are officials from the two clubs holding powerful positions in the SLC executive committee and when a decision regarding their clubs was taken did they refrain from attending the ExCo meeting which should be the normal practice Or were they present to ensure that their clubs were not banned
Whichever way you look at it the whole episode stinks and if these officials have some sort of self respect they should resign from their position at SLC. But in this part of the world such acts are few and far between. Dont be surprised if they carry on regardless of whats happened. Did someone say that this is a land like no other
SLC, SPORTS MINISTER GET A MOUTHFUL FROM MALINGA
Sri Lanka Cricket and the Minister of Sports were left ruing why on earth they called for a brainstorming session at Battaramulla on the guise of creating a new direction for SLC and to transform the national teams flagging fortunes.
The one day session was meant to express views of the players, administrators, officials etc on how to uplift the countrys cricket to the levels it has fallen to and Lasith Malinga one of the few outspoken cricketers of the team seized the opportunity with both hands to let fly a salvo of accusations that left the Sports Minister and the SLC hierarchy ducking and weaving for cover trying to avoid the well directed bouncers that the Slinga let loose at them.
Malinga launched a scathing attack on the type of pitches prepared for the recent series against India which Sri Lanka lost badly blaming SLC for backtracking on the teams requirements and also not taking measures to protect players when they are at the receiving end of criticism from the mainstream and social media. He also questioned the credentials and the contributions made by the High Performance Manager Simon Willis who was got down from England and paid an exorbitant salary, was critical of the policies adopted by the national selectors that led to a lost generation of players in the last decade or so and has left the country with an inexperienced squad of players unable to cope with the demands of international cricket.
In the eyes of many this brainstorming session was believed to be total eyewash to cover the shortcomings and sins of the present cricket administration to which the Sports Minister has also been accused of being party to. In that aspect the meeting was snubbed by several former players and administrators who have been lobbying hard for a change of guard in the wake of recent defeats. The Sports Minister a staunch ally of the SLC president has time and again stated that he will not heed to the demands of appointing an interim committee which in the past have a good track record of pulling Sri Lanka cricket out of troubled waters.

Why kill animals
Lot of discussions are going on about animal rights and compassion to animals. These discussions are related to a statement made by one of the Ministers.
Lot of people have misunderstood this subject.
In Sri Lanka it is not a secret that there are farms rearing chicken and pigs. Beef, pork, chicken and fish are available all over the country. We have very few vegetarians. Many Buddhists eat fish and meat. There are government departments managing fishing and farms.
But the Buddhist teachings have to be respected. People running farms and selling fish is not the fault of Buddhism. Anyone can do these things but do not drag Buddhism into these activities.
As Buddhists we do not ask others not to eat meat, fish and eggs. Bu we want to show what is right and what is wrong according to Buddhist teachings.
The key teachings of Buddhism about animals are these.
Animals and human beings share the same essential nature. We are not separate class of beings to whom a separate class of ethical rule applies.
The highest Buddhist virtue is compassion, which we are to show to all sentient beings at all time.
We should do all in our power to avoid causing suffering or death for any sentient being.
According to Buddhism, all beings tremble before danger. All fear death. When you consider this, you will not kill or cause someone else to kill. All beings fear before danger. Life is dear to all. When you consider this, you will not kill or cause someone else to kill.

Continuous power supply despite TU action
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya assured the public that the electricity supply around the country has returned to normal and under no circumstance will the consumers be disadvantaged.
The Minister who softened his earlier stance of issuing termination orders to protesting workers in a bid to entice them to return, said though the strike continued, Norochcholai, Kerawalapitiya and other power stations were functioning as usual.
Though there were small breakdowns in power supply in certain areas around the country reported all steps are being taken to rectify the situation, said Siyambalapitiya.
He stressed that many workers were returning to work.
Discussions over the proposed salary scale were taken to the offices of the Labour Ministry on Monday night as the unions along with the CEB management resolved to talk things through. Six hours later, it reported that negotiations ended in a deadlock.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister John Seneviratne had agreed to increase the salaries of all workers, except that of the engineers by 13 percent until the new salary scale comes into effect in 2018 and to resolve the salary anomalies from 2015 in two phases. But the unions had refused to call off the strike and asked that the management provide all such promises in writing.
Soumya Kumarawadu of the Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union speaking to the Daily News however believed that no viable solution could come out of negotiations with the Labour Ministry.
The issue of salaries have been discussed for a long time and there were many consultations. We have around 50 trade unions within the CEB, with 25,000 workers. It is a very sensitive topic, he said as he believed that the current proposals put forward by the Management was the best possible agreement they could arrive at.
The workers however allege that the salaries of the engineers have been increased disproportionately to theirs. In 2008, the Engineers received a 75 percent increase in their salaries, nine times higher than non-technical workers. The workers now demand that this increase be rolled back to the earlier ration of 1:6.
You cannot satisfy everyone in an organization as large as ours. We are not in favour of all the proposals made currently but it is the best that the Management can do. Perhaps there were less consultations made at the bottom, Kumarawadu further explained.
He added that it would be unfair to replace the current 2018 salary agreement with any new negotiations as the 2018 proposals were put forward after many consultations and compromises made.
Only 2000 odd people are protesting. They convinced others to step out saying that they could get higher salaries. Most of them thought the strike would end soon and they could get back to work. But now they cannot get back because the Unions are intimidating them and not letting them get back to work, alleged Kumarawadu.
According to Kumarawadu, if the workers agreed to the 2018 salary proposals, the salaries of workers could go up by at least 35-40 percent. The executive officers however have had their salary increase frozen by courts due to a petition against their increase.
There are 900 engineers managing the whole situation now and we are working with the people who are not against this salary hike, if the Ministry takes back its proposal due to a few protests, then they would betray all who stood by them, said the Engineer.
The Engineers he said have not gone on strike since 1996.

Demand for more office spaces - Lamudi
Sri Lankas exceptional economic growth over the past decade has attracted both local and foreign businesses to expand their operations within the country. As a result, the islands most prominent cities, particularly, Colombo, have seen a sharp rise in demand for commercial properties.
To illustrate its magnitude, according to Jones Lang LaSalle Sri Lanka (JLL), the occupancy rate of Colombos grade A office spaces in 2016 was as high as 95%, which is a clear increase from 60% recorded in 2006 - 2008.
As such, the leading property portal Lamudi highlights the importance of understand the growth factors and qualities of the evolving commercial real estate industry within the island.
Economic trends and policies affecting commercial property
Due to the stable and business friendly environment created by the governments financial reforms, the countrys GDP has been growing and, as a result, has been further increasing the demand for commercial properties. Currently, it hovers at around 3%, but is predicted to reach up to 4.1% at the end of 2017.
In addition to this, the removal of the 15% land leasing tax for foreign investors and the reduced approval period for FDI requests has been a fine step in attracting interest from investors abroad.
With the additional FDI, the growth of commercial properties should be facilitated not only within the commercial hub of Colombo; Sri Lankas cities like Kandy, countrys soon-to-be first smart city, Gampaha and Galle where new business opportunities are booming, would benefit from this, as well.
Furthermore, Sri Lanka benefits from being the only country to have Free Trade Agreements with both India and Pakistan. In the future, the government has also planned to set up 45 high Economic Development Zones and 11 Industrial and Technical Zones to attract private investors.
Finally, one of the key driving factors expected to add a considerable number of office spaces, is the Western Region Megapolis Planning Project (WRMPP). It consists of 150 smaller projects, of which the most significant for Colombos commercial real estate expansion is the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) project, also known as the Colombo Port City.
Who is occupying office spaces in SL
As of 2017, the highest demand towards commercial spaces is generated by domestic firms. And, the most popular areas indicated were central business district in Colombo 1, Colombo 2 and Rajagiriya.
According to the JLL report, currently Colombo is composed of nearly one million square feet grade A stock indicating 95% of occupancy. These high end commercial spaces are occupied by institutions like banks, high prices law firms and investment banking companies.
The rise of start-ups
The JLL report suggests that an important strength of the countrys commercial segment is the rise in start-ups.
By now Sri Lanka has multiple start-ups that have shown impressive growth.
Additionally, according to a survey conducted by the SLASSCOM Innovation and Entrepreneurship Forum in 2016, most of the start-ups are in the expansion stage with 55% of them generating early or growing revenues.
Also, their workforce is growing - according to the mentioned survey 38% of entrepreneurs work in a team of 2-5 people, and only 7% of them work on their own. In addition to this, according to EYs Global job creation and entrepreneurship survey for 2015, 47% of global entrepreneurs were expecting their workforce to increase within the first year of the start-up being founded. The survey also indicated that most of these entrepreneurs are between the ages of 25-29. What does this mean The continued expansion of these start-ups will lead to demand for affordable and most importantly flexible office spaces and as such will lead to opportunities for their suppliers to bridge the gap.

Dhuwarshan and Tanya take Nuwara Eliya Junior Open Golf titles
The historic 128 year old Nuwra Eliya Golf Club, a members only club in an effort to support and foster the national golf programme conducted a Junior Open tournament at the picturesque Nuwara Eliya golf course recently. The tournament was a great success with over 70 youngsters competing for honours with prizes being awarded in the age group categories Gold division (15  18 yrs), Silver division (12  14 yrs), Bronze division (10  11 yrs) and Copper division( 9 and under). As per the tournament rules only those in the gold and silver divisions who played the full 18 holes were eligible for the Junior Open titles.
Almost fittingly and in keeping with the clubs vision 14 year old Dhuwarshan of St Xavier College a product of the golf clinic program of NEGC and a relative newcomer to the sport clinched the boys title although playing in the silver division with a superb gross score of 76. Favourite for the girls title Taniya Balasuriya secured her win easily by 8 strokes over rising star Kayla Perera who promised much early on but disappointed once again and had to settle for the runner up spot.
In the individual divisions, Vinod Weerasinghe took the gold division with a score of 79 from Armand Flamer Caldera who shot a gross 80 and once again seemed to have lapses in concentration at crucial times. Kayla Perera took the Silver division as expected but was made to fight tooth and nail by Dilshan Malinda both ending up with identical scores of 86. Kayla was eventually awarded the division on better scores on the back 6 holes.
The bronze division played over 14 holes saw stiff competition amongst the juniors but eventually Nirekh Tejwani of Colombo International School won easily with a clear 4 shot win. However in this age group three youngsters fought hard for honours with Yannik Kumara taking runner up spot followed closely by Sherin Mithara and Shanal Binuksha.
The juniors in the Copper Division, the youngest age group played over just 9 holes showed a keen competition and a whole lot of enthusiasm. Finally a local boy, C. Dharaniyan of Our Lady School in Nuwara Eliya won the division with a score of 47NEGC Junior Open Golf Championship

Dream or nightmare
I dreamed I was a butterfly flitting around; then I woke up. Now I wonder whether I am a man who dreamt of being a butterfly, or whether I am a butterfly dreaming that I am a man. - Zhuangzi (Chinese Philosopher-4th Century BC)
An air of unreality pervades the country. What you see is not what it is; fact, truth, reality - mere words, having no intrinsic meaning. An illusion shrouds another illusion; a maya merely hides another maya, a bottomless pit of deception.
But even from such uncertainty, matters could be inferred, a hypothesis formed.
For example, looking at a regular and inevitable process that happens in this country, there is an uncomfortable truth which jumps at us straight away. We are ruled by, or let us say almost every person we may define as belonging to the category known as elite (Prabuwaru) in this country, are very sick or of infirm health. While the going is good, their infirmities are well concealed. Apparently full of beans, they are; busy making plans for the country, participating in cultural/religious observances, travelling overseas to exchange ideas with foreign leaders, creating careers/opportunities for family and friends, making bombastic speeches and even doing vigorous walks at the Independence Square.
While so occupied, being somewhat exuberant in their temperament and devious in mentality, they inevitably break the law, or so we are told. This has nothing to do with which political party they belong to at the time or the philosophy they profess to follow. And when they are said to have broken the law, their opponents who happen to be in power, will set the law on them. The process ends in court; they are convicted and sentenced to serve a term in gaol.
Prison hospital
The jail is for the healthy. In a civilized society, if a convict is suffering from any ailment, he is sent to the prison hospital to recuperate. In Sri Lanka almost all Prabuwaru are sick (to complete the syllogism - He is a prabu. Therefore he must be sick!) No Prabuwaru will go to a jail because he is too sick to be in a tiny, dirty and unbearably hot cell meant for two, but now occupied by ten inmates! These Prabuwaru who until then were leading us and deciding matters for the 22 million people of this country in one capacity or the other, have extreme sugar or are suffering from life-threatening hyper-tension or have some deep rooted psychological condition (in certain cases, because there is a bullet embedded in the head!) and are in no position to share the life of the healthy prisoners. With rulers in such bad physical (and mental) shape, no great wonder that the country is in the deplorable state it is!
The question arises whether these elite are sick men dreaming that they are healthy or healthy men dreaming that they are sick!
If they are critically sick men, who are only pretending to be healthy, then their conscience should not have let them hold such sensitive positions.
The nation needs men of sound mind and healthy body in leadership positions. On the other hand, if they are healthy men only pretending to be sick in order to avoid the standard life of a convicted prisoner, then again a question arises as to not only their moral make up, but also the integrity of a medical (prison) system which allows the elite to sidestep the system so easily. As it is, we cannot be sure whether these are free men dreaming that they are convicted prisoners, or whether they are prisoners dreaming that they are free men.
We are not suggesting that convicted prisoners be dealt with such harshness that they are broken mentally and physically. Civilized societies are not mere mirror images of marauding criminals.
Today the enlightened attitude towards convicts is to reform, not to torment and destroy the man. In advanced countries prisons are often more comfortable than the average hotel in this country; save for the denial of freedom and the inevitable regimentation of the inmate life. The obvious corruption and the cruelties of our prisons only reflect conditions so ingrained in the society outside. Like every other endeavour we have attempted, or institution we have created, our prisons only reflect our limitations.
Undoubtedly, life in our prisons must be terrible, a slur on a country which takes pride in signing every international convention there is. Sri Lanka undertakes solemnly to maintain basic standards in every area of human existence, including that of prisoners; but practice it in the breach, bungling and frivolous about our responsibilities.
High profile persons
It can be argued that the conviction of high profile persons, especially those from the public service, may have its long term beneficial effects.
The knowledge that one day, they may themselves be the guests of the State at a penitentiary, would be the best prod for our public servants to initiate reforms and uplift these institutions.
For the present, we, like Zhuangzi of 4th Century BC, are not sure whether the Prabuwarus in our dreams are serving jail terms or are just recuperating at a hospital. But unlike the old Chinese philosopher, our dreams are not of pleasant subjects like butterflies. They are bad dreams of a 21st Century society, in irreversible decay. In the dream, we are contributing even the court imposed fines of the wayward Prabuwaru. It goes on and on, a never ending nightmare of the same brazen and blundering Prabuwaru and the same humble and inept victims.

Due to delays in building power plants,unforeseen power procurement: Regulator
The countrys electricity regulator in its latest report has said that the frequent delays in building the planned power plants, unforeseen power procurement and change in the power mix have resulted in a sharp increase in the average unit cost of electricity over the years.
In 2016 alone, the Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) power purchases from oil based plants were six times above the budget for that year.
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka in its recent report Electricity Supply 2020 and Beyond: Challenges and Recommendation further stated that these unnecessary costs were due to the non-implementation of the Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plans (LCLTGEP) agreed to by the CEB and approved by the Commission.
This has resulted in cost overruns, load shedding, and unplanned power procurement in the past few years and these consequences are expected to be continued in the next few years if timely implementation of long term generation plan is not ensured, stated the Commission in a press release on its report yesterday.
The report which analysed the countrys electricity supply, forecasted data, power plant schedule with the actual situation and how LCLTGEPs prepared from the year 2006 to 2016 by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) also highlighted errors in the CEBs energy forecasts, especially in the LCLTGEP 2011 plan.
The CEB, it further noted had identified the problem and is in the process of improving the accuracy of base demand forecast by adopting new forecasting tools.
Lack of investment in the electricity sector and shortcomings in electricity supply thus has been a direct result of non adherence to any of the LCLTGEPs proposals over the years,the Regulator stated.

England opener not included in Essex squad for Hampshire game
Former England captain Alastair Cook will not play for new county champions Essex in this week's game against Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl.
The England and Wales Cricket Board made Cook, 32, available for the final two matches of the season.
Essex have named an unchanged 13-man squad for the away game against Hampshire, which begins on Tuesday.
Head coach Chris Silverwood has set the team the new goal of going through the entire Championship campaign unbeaten. Last season's champions Middlesex went unbeaten, winning six matches and drawing the other 10.
Essex have won eight of their 12 games so far, with four ending in draws, and head the table by 56 points.
They will end the season at home to Yorkshire next week.
"It would be lovely to go through the season unbeaten and although we have already won the league, there will be no let-up in our approach to the remaining two games," 42-year-old Silverwood told the club website.
"We have been ruthless but that's the approach and attitude we want to keep building on." Cook played seven games for Essex earlier in the summer, scoring 667 runs, including four centuries. BBC

Face your fears - Southlands College
To face the unknown and the unpredictable with boldness is Southlands Head Girl Kavindya Liyanages strong point. Perfect Prefects features Kavindya Liyanage a well- qualified lady who has been equipped with all the necessary leadership skills by the school system of Southlands.
As a Head Prefect, I feel I must be a role model and an example to other students. A Head Girl is chosen because she is the most qualified amongst all the students. In her conduct, she must be exemplary. She must see that discipline is maintained at all times in the school. She must also attend to many activities in school such as assisting the teachers. A head girl must have an all-round personality meaning that she needs to give prominence both to her studies and also to other extra-curricular activities, said Liyanage.
Above emotions
Life is unpredictable and unknown, and one must navigate it with courage. In an event anything can go wrong. Things may not go according to the plan. When things start to deviate one may feel a sense of fear. And as the fear builds up, one needs to control ones emotions. One needs to be able to separate thought from emotion. And above all one needs to be strong.
A Head Prefect should have common sense and also needs to think intelligently when confronting problems. The post of Head Prefect is a big challenge as it is. In any festival, things may not go according to plan, so in a way, you need to think on ones feet. A Head Prefect should be prepared to face this, and that in itself is a preparation for what comes next in life. Prefects are appointed for their problem-solving abilities. They are appointed for their critical thinking skills, said Liyanage.
Humans are human. We are not perfect. We cannot see into the future. No matter how much we anticipate things may start to go wrong. Again the fear factor. The pressure gets to you. Suddenly you are unsure. At times like this, you need to think and not let your circumstances determine the outcome.
A festival could be quite hectic. It is an event with a certain amount of pressure. Things may not go as planned. So I feel I have to be calm and composed. I should be unruffled. I should not panic, because if I start to panic that is when things will really fall apart. I need to be able to assess the situation and its pros and cons and I need to be resolute, explained Liyanage.
Way up the system
Southlands has provided Liyanage with an admirable foundation. She has worked her way up the system. She has been where her fellow deputies have been. She knows the system inside out. And it is this knowledge she passes down.
As a Head Prefect, I need to be able to motivate, encourage and inspire my fellow prefects. I need them to follow my vision. I should be able to provide effective and competent leadership.
The knowledge of how to do that comes only through experience. Through trial and error. It is that learning that I pass on to my other prefects. I should have to have prior experience. That is the system at Southlands. By the time the Head Girl receives her post, she has experience in all matters related to school. That is how I face challenges, said Liyanage.
Before criticizing others, Liyanage believes in self-introspection. Before examining others faults, she first works on herself. Believe in yourself and be confident say Liyanage. You need to above all trust yourself and believe that when the dust settles you are the winner.
My message to anyone aspiring for a leadership position is to face any problem boldly. A Head Prefect has to face a variety of problems. There needs to be a certain vision. She needs to be mindful of her own behavior and must assess herself before criticizing others. She must perform her duty to the best of her abilities, said Liyanage.
Book knowledge is certainly very important and that is a requisite for a Head Girl. After all the bookwork always turns into a beautiful butterfly when it emerges from its cocoon. But she must also be competent in other extracurricular activities.
Hands-on experience
When undertaking a task one must be strong. Education, diplomas, and grades are important but practical thinking and intelligence are also important and this can be gained through hands-on experience. If you dont have these skills then you are only a leader by name, said Liyanage.
To learn something of value and to possess something of value you need to be practical and you need exposure which is so important. That wrong decision you make can have drastic effects. You need to be self-possessed.
You need to be independent and takes matters into your own hands when the tide is turning against you. The post of Head Girl is something special. It is the highest student position in the school. It is a triumph and you need to respect it, stated Liyanage
From the time she was small, she has been imbued in music because both her parents were music teachers. Music is superb therapy when facing problems. It helps you think. Music is very powerful. It calms the mind and provides a sense of tranquility.
My mother is my heroine who raised me as a single parent after the death of my father. She has been a huge influence in my life. Like my mother, I want to be a strong woman one day who can overcome anything in life, said Liyanage.
Liyanage is fortunate to have two very reliable deputies. On many occasions, they have brainstormed and come up with solutions. They divide their responsibilities between each other and then execute the plan. You cannot do these things alone because it is group work. Teamwork. By conferring with them she sees the aspect of a problem that she has not considered before.
I see it in a different angle. Combined we make a great team! I want to thank my teachers for their guidance. They point out my mistakes and I learn, said Liyanage
Another thing I want to point out is not to wallow in sad memories and to think objectively regardless of your feelings. If you do not think objectively then you cant take correct decisions, summed up Liyanage.

Former CB Governor Mahendran testifies before Bond Commission
Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran yesterday testified before the Treasury Bond Commission with regards to the February 27, 2015 and March 29, 31, 2016 auctions in question which are under the scrutiny of the Commission.
Mahendrans position was that he was in full agreement with the Tender Board decision taken on February 27, 2015 auction to accept 10.5 billion bids.
He also disagreed with the Auditor Generals position that a loss was incurred by the government at the said auction. Mahendran also expressed his disagreement with Auditor Generals loss calculation in his special audit report on the Treasury Bond issue. Mahendran also stated that he was not involved in the decision making processes of March 29 and 31 2016 auctions, under the Commissions probe.
Legal Representative of former Governor Mahendran, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva made a submission reserving their rights to withdraw from giving evidence at any point that his client was not treated with dignity and fairness.
Mahendran gave evidence before the Commission on changes he made at the Central Bank when he was appointed as the Governor and also rationalized why he thought public auction was a better method to raise debts more than the private placement method. He also gave evidence on the decision making process of the February 27, 2015 auction. He also gave reasons for walking into a Market Operations Committee on the same day, which was chaired by Deputy Governor Dr.Nandalaal Weerasinghe.
Speaking of the backdrop at which the February 27, 2015 auction was held, Mahendran said the biggest economic issue the newly appointed government faced in 2015 was the large debts it had to service. For March 2015, the government requirement was Rs. 72 billion which was a large sum of money, and drastic actions were necessary to meet the demand, Mahendran pointed out.
Legal representative of former CBSL Governor Mahendran, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva led evidence through Mahendran yesterday. At the initial stage of the proceeding, de Silva PC stood to make a submission on behalf of Mahendran.
De Silva PC pointed out that Arjun Mahendran is not a resident of Sri Lanka, so that, he cannot be compelled to give evidence nor he could be compellable to give an affidavit or to respond to any summon.
Mahendran is not legally obliged to give evidence. We are also aware of the order the Commission gave in particular regarding to Aloysius. Well aware of all these facts Mahendran has decided to give evidence in order to assist the Commission. Romesh de Silva PC informed the tribunal.
My submission is that Mahendran is not a citizen of Sri Lanka and should be treated with dignity without being insulted by officers assisting the Commission. If that happens we reserve our rights to make an application at that time to withdraw, Romesh de Silva PC said.
The Tribunal pointed out that the Commission has endeavoured to treat all witnesses in a fair and equal manner. It is our duty to treat all in the witness box with respect. Following an audible Why we have to treat him with reverence and a few chuckles from the Attorney Generals panel, De Silva PC said that he is very confident that the Tribunal will be fair to his client but it would not be the case with all the AGs officers assisting the Commission.
De Silva PC then proceeded with leading evidence through Mahendran on several allegations levelled against his conduct as the Central Bank Governor, especially his decision making relating to February 27 2015 auction.
Romesh de Silva PC: Did you know about the government requirement for 02 March 2015 And how much was that
Arjun Mahendran (AM): Yes I knew. The government required Rs. 13.55 billion 02 March.
RSPC: How were you notified and when
AM: I was given a call by the Secretary to the Treasury saying this amount was needed.
RSPC: At about that time, did you have a meeting
AM: Yes, on 26 February 2015 morning at the Central Bank with participation of Finance Minister, Minster of Highways and advisory to the Prime Minister.
De Silva PC then questioned Mahendran on a letter provided by him to the Commission signed by former Minister of Finance Ravi Karunanayake. De Silva PC asked if the letter confirms that a request was made from the Governor on 26 February 2015 to raise Rs. 75 billion in a months time urgently needed for road development project, to which Mahendran answered in affirmative. When asked as to how he got the said letter, Mahendran said the letter was given by then Finance Minister in June 2016 as a refreshment of memory as to what took place at the 26 February 2015 meeting. According to Mahendran, he requested the said letter prior to going before the second COPE subcommittee investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
Mahendran then explained that he noted the Central Bank failing to meet the requirements and falling short. Given the large amount we were tasked to raise, we had to take drastic action, Mahendran explained.
Mahendran also said that he felt the need to signal the market that the government wants to move to a market friendly approach. By this time auction method has completely ceased. I wanted to change that. he continued.
RSPC: So it was in that background this Treasury bond was advertised
AM: Yes.
RSPC: How much was advertised
AM: 01 billion at 12.5 coupon rate.
RSPC: Why advertise for 1 billion when the requirement was 13.5 billion
AM: I was not sure why. I had discussed with the Deputy Governor in charge and other officials as how to raise this money. They told me that they are going to advertise 01 billion as the government requirement.
RSPC: But why
AM: They told me that if they advertised higher, the market would be aware of the high requirements and the yield would go up. The PDD officers told me that it is their preferred way of advertising. They also said that they could raise the rest of the money through Private Placements, of which I was not particularly happy with. But I gave them the benefit of the doubt.
Explaining further Mahendran said, I was expecting the Secretary to the Finance Ministry to send me an amended cash flow following this sudden requirement of 13.5 billion. But the amended cash flow requirement only came in by the end of April. Allegations were leveled against Mahendran that the cash flow requirement for the month of March does not indicate the said sudden government requirement.
De Silva PC then questioned on Mahendran if he was confident that the Public Debt Department would raise approximately 10.5 billion within the short period of time including a weekend in the given background.
I was informed of the attempts to raise money through private placements about a week before the auction was held. But they were only able to raise 3.5 billion. The attempt must have started by 25 February 2015. Mahendran said. I asked them if it is feasible for them (PDD) to raise 12.1 billion through private placements. They said they are raising. So I told them it was a test of their ability to raise this amount.
Mahendran was then questioned as to why he walked into a Market Operation Committee meeting held on 27 February 2015 morning. According to Mahendran, he was informed of a rise in net open positions to high level and of a falling forward exchange rate, of which he wanted to speak with Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe, who was the Deputy Governor who was responsible for Policy Advisory cluster.
AM: I usually start my office hours by 7 in the morning. I reached my office and asked my secretary to see if Dr. Weerasinghe was available. My secretary then let me know that he was in a meeting, which was the MOC meeting. The meeting was held adjacent to my office.
RSPC: So you went into where the meeting was held
AM: Yes, I walked into the room. I did not realize he was chairing the meeting. I did not want to drag him out of a meeting for me to talk. I told him about the concern I has and told him that I was worried about the condition. While discussing, Dr.Weerasinghe suggested changing the 5% penal rate and going for 6.5%. I argued on my points on the removal.
The decision on the rate cut was taken by the MOC, I suggested and they discussed and agreed. Following the meeting, Dr. Weerasinghe walked into my office with a file and informs me about the decision. I take the full responsibility of this decision which was conquered by the MOC.
De Silva PC then requested Mahendran to what transpired when he walked into the Public Debt Department on 27 February 2015. Many Central Bank officers who testified before the Commission gave evidence suggesting that a Governor walking into the PDD when an auction was going on was not usual.
AM: When I went down to PDD, the officials told me 20 billion bids were received. I went to the PDD twice. I was waiting for results of the auction. I walked around the PDD< had a meeting and just after noon, I went again to the PD.
RSPC: With whom
AM: At the first time, I went with two officers including a security officer who followed me almost everywhere. The second time, I had two Deputy Governors accompanying me to the PDD.
RSPC: How is the bidding done
AM: Electronically.
RSPC: Can you gain anything from this auction
AM: No, I went there to get the results of the auction. I was also keen to find how PDD operates. I wanted to see for myself how it operates.
RSPC: Then you saw a document
AM: Yes. The PDD officials showed me the bid sheet. It was around 12.15 noon.
RSPC: Were the information in the bid sheet gives out the identity of the bidders
AM: No.
RSPC: So then you saw the bid results
AM: Yes, The bids received were 20 billion. It was one of reliefe I felt. PDD officers were pescimistic about raising money through public auctions. This showed that the private sector had an appetite in invest in government bonds. It was also a good sign for the amount of 72 billion requirements.
I then asked the PDD officers if we could accept all 20 billion bids, Mahendran explained. But she (referring to Superintendent of Public Debt Deepa Seneviratne) told me there were dummy bids among the 20 billion bids. According to her these are bids at ridiculously high rates. That was the first time I heared of such a dummy bid. Mahendran explained.
RSPC: So ultimately what happened
AM: They told me the reasonable amount to accept was 10.5 billion. The ideal coupon rate was 12.5 and the yield rate was 11.75. If 01 billion was accepted, the yield rate could have been somewhere around 10.5 where as if 10 billion it was only 11.75 yield rate.
RSPC: So in whose hands the final decision was
AM: In the Tender Board.
RSPC: So the final decision to take the 10.5 billion was a tender Board decision
AM: Yes.
RSPC: Did the PDD submit an option sheet to the Tender Board
AM: They should have.
RSPC: Then the Tender Board took a decision to accept the 10.5 billion
AM: Yes.
RSPC: The decision of the Tender Board was sent to you
AM: Yes.
RSPC: You could have vetoed the decision
AM: Yes.
RSPC: But you did not
AM: No I did not. I was fully involved in the acceptance process.
Asked if he ever discussed about his business matters with his family, Mahendran said he never discussed such matters with his family. In a lighter tone, De Silva PC asked if he would have spoken of private placement with your wife, to which Mahendran with a smile answered, No, She would not have been interested! Amusement was also apparent when Mahendran explained as to why he did not reside in the Bank House, which is the official residence of a CBSL Governor. The bank house was in a very bad condition. It was not maintained well. Furniture was basic. There was dog urine on the carpets. Justice P.S. Jayawardena was curious to know who lived at the Bank House before. I believe it was the previous Governor. Mahendran answered.
Meanwhile, Mahendran told the Commission that he wanted to address serious issues in the Central Bank which has caused the CBSL to incur losses up to Rs. 39 billion in 2013-2014 years. Following his appointment, Mahendran said he was keen to solve these issues because the CBSL cannot make losses.
The most worrying thing was that the Central Bank had incurred losses. Large losses. In the year 2013-2014 in their reporting year, from the numbers I got from the Chief Accountant, it was indicated that the loss was over Rs. 39 billion. Mahendran said.
This was rather shocking, because CBSL cannot make losses as they have license to print money. So this showed that there was something pretty rotten at the heart of the Central Bank. So I wanted to attend to this matter really fast, Mahendran said. He explained that his decision to relocate staff and restructure the operations came following this concern.
Mahendran is to testify before the Treasury Bond Commission today as well.

Further cross examination on October 10
The cross examination into the Udaya Gammanpila misappropriation case will be taken up again on October 10.
When the case against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila regarding the alleged misappropriation of Rs 20 million through the sale of shares of a company using a forged power of attorney was taken up for hearing in the Colombo High Court, High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe put off further cross examination by the defence for October 10.
When the case was taken up on Monday, Shaveendra Fernando PC appearing for the defence cross examined Brian Shaddick, owner of a private firm in Australia named Digital Nominees. Although Shaddick had earlier claimed that he never visited Sri Lanka between the period 1996 to 2015, the Defence Counsel reminded him that he had visited Sri Lanka in October 1997 to be an attesting witness at the marriage of one Sydney Jayasinghes son.
Defence Counsel also questioned him about throwing away outdated passports.
In this case, the Attorney General has indicted MP Udaya Gammanpila on two courts including the misappropriation of Rs 20 million by selling shares issued by Pan Asia Bank in the name of Digital Nominees Company to one Dhammika Perera on July 27, 2000 or thereabout.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appeared for the Attorney General and a team of attorneys led by Shaveendra Fernando PC and Jayantha Weerasinghe appeared for the defence.
Gammanpila who held the post of Central Environment Authority Chairman under the Rajapaksa government defected from the Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) in 2014 and pledged his support to then President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Gammampila sits with the Joint Opposition in Parliament.
Evidence led by the prosecution in the case earlier this year included a report by the Government Analyst Department's Examiner of Questioned Documents (EQD) asserting that the signature of Brian Shaddick was cut and pasted from another document,and that the signature of Shaddick's wife on the false power-of-attorney instrument was forged.
On Monday, Shaddick, when asked under cross-examination whether he had indeed issued such a power-of-attorney, vehemently denied the charge. Shaddick responded passionately to an allegation by defence counsel that the entire case was put together simply as an excuse for police officers to visit Australia on holiday under the auspices of recording his statement as ridiculous, commending the hard work and diligence of the SIU officers who helped bring the case to trial.

Genesis of the Grand Old Party
The Sinhala Maha Sabha of SWRD Bandaranaike, Muslim League led by T B Jayah, and the Ceylon National Congress [CNC] a powerful political entity formed on the lines of Indias National Congress and led by Don Stephen Senanayake the Leader of the House in State Council, were the three political forces that combined to form United National Party. The Congress was a nationalist party formed by the members of Ceylon National Association and Ceylon Reform League on December 11, 1919, during the Colonial rule. At the end of 1942, DSS announced his displeasure with the new policies and new outlook of Congress. He resigned forthwith from the Executive committee, and within months he severed all relations with the Congress.
Senanayake, the man with foresight sought to retain the Tamils and Muslims also maintained under one flag. His assessment was based purely on policy matters: he opposed with its aim of achieving full freedom from the British Empire, preferring Dominion status; he disagreed with the proposals of Congress favouring Swabhasha instead of English; and opening doors of CNC for Communist members. These disagreements motivated him to form a political party free from religious and racial divisions. DS stated publicly his wish to retire from Congress insisting that,
they ought to speak for the whole country rather than a party functioning for political power of a section - Excerpt from letter of resignation dated 22/12/43
Six years later on December 29, 1949, JR Jayewardene moved a resolution at Kandy sessions of Congress, that the CNC  should now be dissolved-- Daily News - 30/5/1949
By early 1946 DS was thinking of forming a new political movement that would stand for national harmony and of moderate views, an organisation acceptable to the minorities. Most of the Congress members and almost all in the State Councils government associates accepted his invitation leading to the birth of UNP on 6th September 1946.
UNPs Working Committee
The minutes of the first meeting does not carry a record on electing an Executive Council; only that the first meeting of the Executive Council was held at the same venue immediately followed by the inaugural session, The minutes says,
Meeting of EC was held on September 11, 1946, at Zahira College at 4.30 pm. Chaired by D S Senanayake, the house resolved to, as moved by Chairman..,
1. That the following members of the Exco be elected the Working Committee of the Party. 20 members with U. A. Jayasundera as its Secretary.
2. That the ExCo do delegate to the WC all the powers vested in the EC under the Constitution.
A WC meeting was held at Temple Trees on 8th August, 1949, at 9.15 pm., presided by DSS. Present: SWRD B. (Late arrival), Sir John K, T.B. JayahAfter the minutes Sir John wanted leave to bring a matter of great urgency and importance before the meeting. He placed before the group a copy of the Times of Ceylon of 8th (same day) instant and read there from the report of a speech supposed to have been made by SWRD at a meeting of the Singhala Maha Sabha and invited the committee to consider what action, if any, the committee should take as the speech, he insisted on was highly harmful to the interest of the Partya resolution was adopted, to wit,
Following a general discussion in which the members present unanimously agreed on a resolution, to wit,
1. that in the opinionthe speechcontained, (a) matters which were inaccurate in point of fact and, (b) opinion which bought [or were calculated to bring] the Party into ridicule and disrepute thereby undermining the confidence of the public in the Party.2. That this matter be brought up before the usual monthly meeting of WC to be held at TT on 15/8/49to consider action3. Secretary to write immediately to SWRD, inquiring the correctness of the reportget him to make a statementdiscuss it at next meeting
Bandaranaikes reply was tabled at monthly meeting on 15th August, where he spoke of newspaper report, inaccurate in some aspects in reporting and conveying an inaccurate impression. However, the Committee decided to write to the newspaper highlighting every point raised in the letter. One of the points reported in the report attributed to Bandaranaike said,
no important question was ever placed before the EC of the Party; it had never met. At the end of the year the members had to play the part of yes-manto which SWRD replied, I said, Parties in Ceylon, both in the past and the present had displayed a tendency not sufficiently to consult party organisations when important questions arose, the UNP was falling into the same tendency and in its best interest this should be remedied.
Policy clashes
The explanation was well received. SWRD did not dissolve Sinhala Maha Sabha. Two leaders, DSS and Bandaranaike were the custodians of traditional forces; their combined efforts led the UNP to victory at the General Elections held under Soulbury Constitution in 1947. However, personality and policy clashes between the top two in the new party aggravated. The first sign of a split emerged when Bandaranaike made some sarcastic remarks as mentioned before, and steadily developed into wider cracks resulting in a major break up in July 1951.
The SM Sabha, one of the three branches met in early June under SWRD where they resolute to present some suggestions in the form of resolutions to the UNP. The seven-point resolution was discarded in-toto by the UNPs EC, saying, they were not in order. The SMS met again re-structured the motion and fired it back to the UNP; it decided not to reassess. DSS was firm on its conclusion as it was not necessary to reconsider; Past, it was a mistakenly entertained and not to follow the practice.
A deputation led by J. C. Moonesinghe of SMS met the PM in a last effort to influence him; the two hour discussion was unsuccessful. The EC of S. M. Sabha met once more and decided to make an announcement through the press.

Greeks out of the shelves
Ideas, thoughts and creative visions born out of two main cultures could be named as Indian and Greek. Our teachers and their teachers often go back to these cultures in order to bring back the required and essential foundations of knowledge from these two cultures. As such, the number of books and the interpretations they carry is countless. The statement that goes as the most modern visions are found in most ancient cultures could be cited as a profound eternal ideology. I found the validity of this statement while reading the pages of the newest research contribution of Professor Kamani Jayasekara, titled as Ideas on Literary Criticism of the Ancient Greeks.
Professor Jayasekara paves the way to grasp the essence of Greek ideas on literary criticism taking into account the Greek creative writers as well as philosophers. The creative writers are basically the forerunners of the theatrical arts such as Aristophanes, Euripides, Sophocles, and Aeschylus. The philosophers include the great Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.
Ancient creators
The reader is made to know about their various creations, as well as the social thinking process, enabling how they helped mould a better living condition. How very beneficial and how very resourceful the ancient creators and philosophers in the propagation of their ideas and thoughts for those of us who live today. Have they not undergone changes in keeping with the contemporary innovative discoveries and ideological trends
Jayasekara writes: The criteria for evaluating literature has been of controversial throughout the years ever since it was first established and became a popular necessity. The numerous ideas pertaining to evaluation has been subject to change before the actual ideas took their form as criteria. The criteria mainly depended on the changing values of the social context they were existing.
The introductory chapter titled as Introduction to ancient literary Criticism embrace an account of a series of eye-opening sequence that triggers off classics said to have been created by the Greek poet Homer, who created Iliad and Odyssey.
Proceeding from this point, the researcher leads the reader such celebrities as Sappho, Theognis, Simonides, Thespis, Thales, Heraclitus and Xenophanes. Followed by notes enter the discussion on such creatures as Aristophanes taking into account most all the theatrical works like The Archanians, The Wasps, Clouds, Frogs, Lysistrata and Peace.
Appropriately discussed
Followed by the interpretation on the most known Greek dramatists, an interpretation to their creative procedure are interspersed via the political social and cultural interpretation mainly on the visions as laid down by the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. I sincerely felt that the need of the time is to see some of these literary of philosophical speculation should be written in Sinhala and Tamil in order to help build a better climate of opinion.
The concepts on comedy, tragedy and new comedy are discussed with examples from each area. At the same time, the evolution of the terms such as catharsis, imitation, the theory of mimesis, ethics and ethical interpretation, rhetorics, poetics are briefly yet appropriately discussed. These may help a student at the higher level of education to consider the cross-cultural conditions of the usages both in the Orient and in the Occident. Even though the term modern and modernity are not used by the researcher, this text deals with them in an indirect manner. These notes ought to be passed down in the form of a discourse taking the each ancient Greek personality chronologically. The printed publication is based on her PhD thesis.
As we were tutored by some of the veteran English teachers of literature, one of the main sources of creative spirit was derived from Greek legend and mythology. All of the great translators of Greek poetry myth and legend happen to be Robert Graves. According to Graves, myths and legends of Greek origin happen to seep into even to English and French poetry and drama. One predominant example is Prometheus legend.
Learned reader
Theories of Catharsis as founded by Aristotle in relation to rhetoric, ethics and politics is exemplified further into several categories by Jayasekara. They include segments such as behaviorual view, emotional and psychological view, medicinal interpretations and ethical interpretations. This enables a learned reader to compare the theories of catharsis not merely limiting the meaning embedded in one sector, but to a multi-dimensional creative vision.
Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra once told me that even the great oriental theatre theorist Bharatamuni too had laid emphasis on the term catharsis denoting the same as Vishodana or Vishranti when he said vishranti jananam natyam. The term Vishranti is equivalent to the term catharsis as it carries the meanings of all manners of purification.
The concept of getting rid of pity and fear embraces the achievement of purification or the ultimate cleaning. In the manner, the text of Jayasekara helps the discerned reader to enter areas that are latent from the upper layers of verbal meanings. All in all the publication Jayaseakra leads not only to understand the ideas on literary criticism of the ancient Greeks but also to trace beyond those limits as an extension of insights on comparative literary and communication studies.
This commendable effort emphasises the vital role played by the ancient Greek playwrights and philosophers in order to mould a better spate of living. We who read these materials could gain enormous insights into our own living conditions.

He Forgot the Tune..!
Theres a video clip doing the rounds through whatsapp, of the Prime Minister of India, walking off while the Indian National anthem is being played in Russia. The clip jokingly explains, that Modis been globe-trotting so much, hes forgotten his own national anthem!
I have no doubts about Modis love for India, though if this had happened to another, an arrest warrant would have been issued.
Today, the courts have declared, in the same country Modi belongs to, that it is a crime not to stand for the national anthem, and politicians have even started introducing Vande Mataram, another patriotic song to be sung in schools. We need patriotic citizens! they say.
Which brings me to a question: Should patriotism be enforced, or does it spring from within
Its like a lover courting his beloved, telling her, If you dont love me, Ill kill you!
What she cries bewildered.
Stand up, when you address me! Show me respect when you speak to me! he shouts.
Whats that you have in your hand she cries terrified.
A knife to threaten you with! Ill slit your throat if I hear a disrespectful tone!
But I want to love you for the good qualities I might find in you! For kindness, compassion, your firmness, your discipline!
Enough! shouts her lover, Love me or Ill kill you!
Same scene when we try to enforce patriotism. Stand up! say the politicians to the people, Stand up while the anthem is being sung, or youll languish in jail, and
And what the people cry helplessly.
You will be branded as unpatriotic!
I have seen many national anthems being sung, with fervor and passion. The passion isnt from the tune, nor from the words, or from some policemen or Kim-Jong looking to see whether they are just mouthing it, not singing it. Nay, it rises from their hearts!
And what happens if there aint passion What happens if they sit, or slouch or in the eyes of others, act disrespectful; nothing! If you dont have it buddy, tough luck, youre missing something our country offers!
Ten years ago, with a group of choristers I sang my national anthem on a stage in Austria, on our Independence Day! I cried! Tears of joy! An outpouring of love. An enveloping of sadness, I was so far from home: I looked at the others on stage with me, each sang with same feeling!
Hey! says her new lover, Take your time, learn about me, and then love me with all your heart and soul!
I will! she whispers, I can feel love flowing in my veins!
Patriotism is love, and love cannot be enforced.
I dont know what the honourable Indian judges are going to do, when they see the video of Modi walking off while his anthem is played, but Ill plead for him, Hes not less patriotic, he just forgot the tune..!

Holder gives Windies hope in delayed England ODI opener
MANCHESTER: West Indies captain Jason Holder led from the front with 41 not out in his side's 204 for nine against England in the first one-day international at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
Holder's men have to win this five-match series 5-0 or 4-0 with a tie or no-result if they are to qualify directly for the 2019 World Cup in England.
The no-result part of that equation started to look a possibility when, despite bright sunshine, a wet outfield saw the umpires delay the scheduled start by two hours even though the sun was shining.
In a match reduced to 42 overs per side,West Indies slumped to 160 for seven and were in danger of being dismissed for a lower score than the 176 the World Twenty20 champions managed in their T20 victory against England in Durham on Saturday.
But Holder, who won the toss, at least gave his bowlers some sort of a target to defend in a 33-ball innings featuring five fours.
Rival all-rounder Ben Stokes led England's attack with three for 43 but his nine overs also included two no-balls -- one for height smashed by Holder for four in the last over -- and four wides. AFP

ICT legal pioneer Jayantha Fernando presented Lifetime Award at SLT Zero One Awards
Jayantha Fernando, an Internet law and policy expert, was recently recognized with a Lifetime Award at the inaugural SLT Zero One Awards.
Fernando pioneered ICT legal policy reform and helped the establishment of Internet governance processes in Sri Lanka. Prof Abhaya Induruwa (Internet pioneer) and Kris Canekeratne of Virtusa, too were honoured on this occasion, at a ceremony held in Colombo. Fernando is the Chairman of the L.K. Domain Registry and serves as Director/Legal
Advisor at the ICT Agency of Sri Lanka and also serves on the board of several entities.
He also co-chairs the Task Force for the National Certification Authority in Sri Lanka in addition to the work he does with ISPs and banks to address cyber security policy issues with the countrys CERT Coordination Centre. The event was organized by Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT), with the objective of recognizing, honouring and encouraging excellence in digital initiatives in Sri Lanka, with the Lifetime Awards being presented to professionals who had made significant contributions to the countrys digital industry.
Commenting on this achievement, Fernando said, I am truly honoured to receive this Lifetime Award at the SLT Zero One Awards.
I see this initiative as a timely effort in boosting digital transformation in the country. Over the past two decades several key stakeholders, including Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Justice, Legal Draftsmans Dept and Attorney Generals Dept helped and supported our legal reform initiatives to overcome legal challenges. The pioneering work started at the CINTEC Law Committee continued as the e-laws component of the e-Sri Lanka Development Program of ICTA.
Whilst paying special tribute to late Justice Mark Fernando, PC and late Prof V.K. Samaranayake, Fernando expressed his gratitude to the founders of ICTA, all Chairmen, CEOs, former leadership team colleagues as well as key stakeholders of the e-Sri Lanka program and thanked the organisers of the event for 'helping to recognizes all our key stakeholders and the committed staff of ICTA through this award'. In the sphere of cyber law, Jayantha Fernando has helped draft several pieces of legislation required for electronic trade.
The Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 facilitates domestic and international electronic commerce by eliminating legal barriers and establishing legal certainty; and the Computer Crimes Act No. 24 of 2007 provides for the identification of computer crimes and stipulates the procedure for the investigation and enforcement of such crimes. Together this legislation forms the corner stone of e-Law for this country.
Fernando has also advised in the formulation of the Payment Devices Frauds Act of 2006 and Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2005. He developed the legal framework for the use of authentication technologies for the National Payment Network (LankaClear), which is now used each day for Inter-Bank Payment Systems and Cheque Imaging and Truncation System.
In drafting legislation, he was instrumental in ensuring that Sri Lanka conformed to international best practices, such as Budapest Cyber Crime Convention, UNCITRAL Model Laws as well as the UN Electronic Communications convention. He also gave leadership to Sri Lankas entry to the Budapest Cybercrime Convention and Sri Lankas ratification of the UN Electronic Communications Convention in 2015, both firsts for South Asia.
Jayantha Fernando became the first South East Asian to be elected to the Strasbourg based Bureau of The Cybercrime Convention Committee (T-CY) of the Council of Europe, which administers the Budapest Cybercrime Convention globally.

Indonesia and Sri Lanka will soon set up a parliamentary cooperation group to further strengthen cooperation between the two countries in various fields such as politics, economy, and culture.
 "Indonesia and Sri Lanka both share an important relationship in terms of parliament between the two countries," Chairman of the Inter-Parliamentary Cooperation Board (BKSAP), Nurhayati Ali Assegaf, stated while receiving Sri Lankan Honorary Ambassador to Indonesia, Dharshana Mahendra Parera, at her office in the Parliament building in Jakarta on Tuesday.
 The request to open the working group of the Indonesian and Sri Lankan Parliaments was conveyed directly by Parera, because there had been no cooperation of parliament till date.
 According to Nurhayati, the parliamentary diplomacy can further strengthen the cooperation between the two countries, with the formation of the parliamentary cooperation group.
 "The relationship between Indonesia and Sri Lanka is very important because both countries share similar pluralism and history," Nurhayati noted.
 The Democratic Party politician added that Sri Lanka is very appreciative of the Indonesias diverse regional culture and the friendly manners of the people.
 The Sri Lankan Parliament, according to her, sees that the tolerance in the life of the state in Indonesia is highly observed.
 "Interpersonal relationships will benefit the country, especially tourist visits, as more and more tourists from Sri Lanka visit Indonesia," he remarked.
 Meanwhile, Parera expressed his appreciation over the success of the House of Representatives in organizing the World Parliamentary Forum in Bali on Sept 7 and 8.

Intex South Asia - integrating region, developing manufacturing powerhouse
The World Bank has stated that South Asia is best placed to attract garment and textile businesses, as the region is an industrial powerhouse due to rising exports with growth fuelled by robust domestic demand.
The Asian Development Bank report states that South Asia will remain the fastest growing of all sub-regions in Asia and the Pacific, with growth on track to meet original projections of 7% in 2017 and 7.2% in 2018.
At the same time, Governments across South Asia have launched numerous initiatives aimed at diversifying products, broadening export markets and towards increasing global market share in the highly competitive textiles and garments sector.
The outlook for the region is positive but the way forward for the industry is for South Asian countries to combine their strengths and overcome individual weaknesses by aligning with each other and to increase intra-regional trade to help grow exports.
Understanding this tremendous potential, Intex South Asia was created to help manufacturers and buyers take advantage of opportunities developing in the region and assist in consolidating the regions position with all other countries by combining their strengths, joining hands and creating stronger business ties under one trading platform.
The third edition of Intex South Asia is the largest and only international textiles sourcing exhibition in South Asia, which brings together quality manufacturers and buyers onto a single platform. The dynamic business opportunities at the fair accessed via the networking reception, customised business matching and the different country pavilions have translated into many entrepreneurs growing their businesses from Intex South Asia.
Intex South Asia 2017 is 40% bigger than 2016 and will showcase around 250 exhibitors from 15 countries and regions from November 15-17 at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre (SLECC), Colombo.
Today, Sri Lanka's growth, its reputation for quality manufacturing and value addition is attracting manufacturers and investors from across the globe. Sri Lanka plays a pivotal role for intra-regional integration due to its politically neutral status, creating a positive business environment for entrepreneurs from Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh to meet and do business together.
At the same time, Sri Lanka is also transforming into a regional business hub attracting international interest as the optimum location to conduct business with South Asian countries in one central location. Sri Lanka has all the advantages to be developed as the economic hub of South Asia, thus making it the gateway to the huge South Asian market.
The GSP-Plus concession awarded to Sri Lanka will greatly boost Sri Lankan industry which will now be able to export over 6,000 products duty free to the European Union (EU). The additional tariff concession gained by the apparel categories will see duties cut from 9.6% to 0%. More EU customers are now expected to change their sourcing strategy (favouring duty free countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia) in favour of Sri Lanka.
GSP Plus will enhance Sri Lankas apparel exports, comprising 61% of total exports to the EU. The reduction of tariffs is estimated to be valued at around US$ 60 million. Apparel exporters anticipate a 10-15% boost in export earnings in 12 months following regaining of GSP Plus, and will particularly accrue to the smaller players.
Arti Bhagat, Director, Worldex India, organiser of Intex South Asia said, GSP Plus is a positive development for Sri Lankas economic progress.
Intex South Asia takes this development to the next level by enabling Sri Lankan exporters and manufacturers to come together and take advantage of common synergies towards quicker lead times, faster sourcing of quality fabrics and trims to create superior offerings.

JO urges Government not to postpone PC elections
The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday said they would send a letter to the Speaker of Parliament requesting him not to allow the Government to postpone the Provincial Council elections.
Former minister G.L. Peiris addressing the media in Colombo said the Government continued to postpone polls as they were afraid of going before the people.
He said the Government was continuing to violate the peoples mandate by postponing polls.
JO will go to court if the Government makes an effort to postpone the PC elections, he said.

Khalid Latif: Pakistan batsman banned for five years after spot-fixing inquiry

Pakistan batsman Khalid Latif has been banned from cricket for five years for his part in a spot-fixing ring.
A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) tribunal handed down the punishment after finding Latif guilty of all charges at a hearing on Wednesday,
The PCB has been conducting a long-running investigation into corruption in the Twenty20 Pakistan Super League.
Latif, 31, has played five one-day internationals and 13 Twenty20 internationals for Pakistan.
He was fined one million Pakistan rupees (7,020) after being found guilty of fixing or taking a bribe to underperform, failing to disclose corrupt approaches and soliciting players into corrupt acts.
Fellow Islamabad United batsmanSharjeel Khan was also bannedfor five years last month, with two and a half years of his ban suspended.
Spot-fixing is where the outcome of a particular passage of play is pre-determined, as opposed to fixing the outcome of a match.
All-rounderMohammad Nawazand seamerMohammad Irfanhave also been sanctioned as part of the inquiry after they failed to report suspicious approaches.
A number of other players have also been questioned or suspended while the inquiry is carried out.
Britain's National Crime Agency provided the initial intelligence that led to the PCB investigation.

The protesters demanded that their colleague be reinstated in his previous position immediately. Later, Municipal Commissioner Varuna Samaradiwakara who held a discussion with worker representations, agreed to cancel the transfer and hold an inquiry into the alleged incident and the workers gave up the protest and resumed their duties.

March towards market economy while protecting identity: PM
We should march towards a market economy while protecting Sri Lankas identity, democracy and human rights. There are many objectives we should achieve in this manner. The US is contemplating on building a wall across the Mexican border. England is thinking about leaving the European Union. It did not involve any religious consideration. We too should act on these lines and march towards such a society devoid of religionism, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing the prize giving ceremony at Zahira College, Maradana as the chief guest on September 15.
The Prime Minister said certain sectors of the media are trying to increase sales and publicity by speaking about a single religion or community.
Sometimes, competition among commercial enterprises too acquired a communal or religious orientation. We could not leave room for such activities undertaken by a coterie of people, he said.
The Prime Minister said he had discussed this matter with all party leaders.
The problem confronting each party leader was the manner in which he or she should act to stabilize the party stand and identity without losing the voter base. One should not try to gain petty political advantage in discussing this matter.
The Prime Minister said the Opposition Leader in Parliament was a member of the Tamil community. Other sections of the opposition are working in co-operation with him.
This was the last opportunity we had gained to foster national unity and Sri Lankan identity. It was not the responsibility of President Sirisena or him as Prime Minister alone, he said.
This was a responsibility of all including those present on that occasion. This matter should be discussed openly without fear or favour, the Premier added.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said people were moving away from communalism today. What they desired was to unite and foster social and economic development, now that we had overcome a 30-year war. We had the strength and knowledge to march forward in unity.
As such, the task before us was to fulfill shortcomings and march towards a society where everyone could enjoy equal rights and opportunities, he said. Referring to a statement made by an earlier speaker regarding shanty dwellers, the Prime Minister said talks were underway to allocate massive funds to the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry to build new housing schemes to accommodate shanty dwellers evicted from shanties.
It was poverty which we should consider as our enemy, he said. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that Zahira College was established with the aim of creating Sri Lankans.
Today we are striving to stabilize Sri Lankan identity through the political and social system. We have neglected this work despite gaining independence before India. While inviting all to join hands in this endeavor, I wish to conclude by wishing Zahira College the very best and a bright future, he said.

Mavai Senathirajahs landmark decision
During the month of August, amidst a summer dominated by high-level political resignations and firings, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka ruled on a major case.
A Three-Judge Bench, including Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, found that Tamil political parties who were advocating for an increased sharing of power under a new Federal model, were not breaking the law.
These parties did not support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka, Chief Justice Dep noted in his decision.
A finding in the opposite direction would have been crippling for parties such Illankai Thamil Arasu Kadchchi, or ITAK: arguing for secession is a crime in Sri Lanka under the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution.
At the time, many in civil society, especially Tamil political parties, celebrated Chandrasoma v. Mavai Senathirajahas a landmark decision.
But a month later, some were beginning to question as to how significant the decision actually was.
A long - fought battle
Recently, in an airy top-floor lecture hall at the University of Jaffna one afternoon, M. A. Sumanthiran defended his hard fought decision in front of the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court
Sumanthiran, who is a Member of Parliament for the Jaffna District and a leading Counsel on the case, said the Supreme Courts decision was a direction changer for politics in this country.
The court had no necessity to go this distance in this particular case, he said. But they have.
Sumanthiran traced the long battle leading to the judges unanimous opinion. The petition was originally filed against the ITAK, a constituent party of the Tamil National Alliance, by Hikkadu Koralalage Don Chandrasoma, a resident of Kelaniya, in 2014.
He alleged that the ITAK was a political party whose aims and objects were the establishment of a separate State within the territory of Sri Lanka. If so, under Article 157A of the Constitution, the partys members could be stripped of their office as well as their property which was not necessary for the sustenance of such a person and his family.
The petitioner focused on a section of the partys constitution to build up his case. Its English translation reads: The objective of this party is to establish political, economic and cultural liberation among the Tamil speaking people by way of forming an autonomous Tamil Government and autonomous Muslim Government as part of the united federal Sri Lanka in accordance with the principles of self - determination.
But Lawyers for Chandrasoma said the partys constitution had been amended in 2008 to replace the word federal with confederation, which means an alliance between separate and sovereign states, rather than allied states under a central government.
Sumanthiran and his legal team however, countered that point, arguing that the petitioner had misunderstood the Tamil word in question. In 2008, the Party did change the Constitutions wording, he said, to replace the Sanskritized samashdi with the pure Tamil inaippadchi.
The Official Languages Commission agreed with position.
In response, the petitioner acknowledged that the word did not meant confederation, but argued that the act of advocating for self-determination in itself involved attaining an independent state.
But once again, the court sided with ITAK. It is clear that the right to self-determination has had an internal dimension, in that, it could be exercised within the country to the benefit of a people, inside the country, the Chief Justice wrote.
The judges dismissed Chandrasomas petition on August 4th.
Sumanthiran stressed that this was a major achievement.
So the significance of the judgement is that it says it is not illegal, it is not unlawful and it is not unconstitutional to claim to have a system of government based on a federal form, based on the principle of right to self-determination and shared sovereignty, Sumanthiran said.
He said these findings provide Tamil parties important legitimacy and leverage at the bargaining table of the new Constitution-making process.
Counterpoint
But Professor K. Guruparan, head of the Department of Law at the University of Jaffna, was more critical in his assessment of the decision.
The fact that a political party in Sri Lanka has to go through the Supreme Court and convince Court that they are not advocating for secession, is in itself an attack on free speech, he said.
Guruparan added that he believed the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution which criminalizes advocating for secession, should be done away with.
He agreed with Sumanthiran that the Courts ruling goes against the grain of previous government decisions.
But pointed to specific parts of the opinion he found troublesome.
Although the decision legitimized the political parties ability to advocate for a federal form of power-sharing, it does not explicitly say if arguing for a confederation model is the same as arguing for secession.
In fact, the Court had taken great pains to make sure the ITAK was promoting a federal form of government, rather than a confederation.
Guruparan said that presently, it was not clear if parties that argue for a confederation model, where sovereign states give a specified set of functions to a central authority, such as the European Union, would now stand in violation of the Constitution.
The language of the decision, he said, gives a problematic, rigid interpretation of what a unitary state means.
We need to be careful, he added.
Shifting thepolitical landscape
After the forum, Sinnarasa Thananchayan, a Law student of the University of Jaffna, said the two mens positions represented a fundamental change happening in Tamil politics.
Sumanthirans position was rooted in the landscape of a party politician, where the currency is measurable political wins and losses. Ive consistently argued these concepts in front of the courts, he had said earlier. This is a direction change.
But many intellectuals are becoming disenchanted with the TNA, Thananchayan said, believing they were too compromised.
The TNA is not very strong in demands and wishes to work with the government, he said.
Instead, young people and intellectuals are looking for a new path to self-determination, separate from the violence of the LTTE, but also different than the political calculus of the TNA.
This has led to some supporting the Tamil National Peoples Front, a breakaway from the TNA launched in 2010.
Thananchayan said the TNPF argues more forcefully for recognition of the Tamil identity, a strong federal system of government and accountability for war crimes.
The decision in Chandrasoma v. Mavai Senathirajah may give the Tamil parties a stronger position in the new constitution-making process.
But people such as Guruparan and Thananchayan wonder: Can they trust the results of a process where they believe theyve sacrificed so much, where they must go to the Supreme Court just to affirm their right to self-determination
If they get a new Constitution, would it actually represent their interests

Mexico: Strong earthquake topples buildings, killing scores

A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 100 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City.
Rescue workers are searching for survivors buried under rubble and officials warn the death toll may rise.
The 7.1 magnitude quake caused damage in Morelos and Puebla states and in Mexico State. It struck while many people took part in an earthquake drill exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands.
The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an 8.1 magnitude tremor in the south left at least 90 dead. The epicentre of the latest quake was next to Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey said. At least 54 people were killed in Morelos state alone, south of the capital, and 26 reported killed in Puebla state.
Thirty are confirmed dead in Mexico City with another nine in Mexico State. About two million people in the capital were without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials also warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa that rescue services were dealing with collapsed or badly damaged buildings at 44 locations.
The earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on the 32nd anniversary of a quake that killed up to 10,000 people. Earthquake alarms did sound, correspondents say, but some residents apparently thought they were part of the day of drills. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Jennifer Swaddle, a teacher at the British International School in Mexico City, told the BBC that part of her classroom collapsed after the earthquake hit.
"Something that started as a tremor quickly escalated into something where the classroom shook," she said. "As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening."
A six-storey blocks of flats, a supermarket, a school and a factory were said to be among the collapsed buildings in Mexico City. Teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. "My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her," said Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, choking back tears next to a collapsed building.
"She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak." President Enrique Pea Nieto urged people to avoid the streets so emergency services could reach the most affected areas.
Panic on the streets
Mexico City is a city all too used to earthquakes.But this tremor, on the anniversary of another one that left thousands dead in 1985, was especially powerful. It sent thousands of people into the streets, trembling, shaking, crying, and trying to reach their loved ones by phone.
As time passes it is becoming clear that there are going to be many victims.
In the capital alone, about 30 buildings collapsed. In one of the worst-affected areas I saw dozens of people desperately removing rubble because they believed someone was trapped.
Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Foreign leaders sent messages of support to Mexico as the scale of the disaster became clear.
US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: "God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you." Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the "devastating news".

Moratuwa University celebrates 62nd anniversary
The 62nd Anniversary of the Moratuwa University fell on September 13. It was a gift from the Canadian Government during the Premiership of late Sir John Kotelawala.
The Canadian Government initiated two projects during that period; a hospital and two technical colleges; one to Moratuwa and the other to the Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia electrorates.On September 13, 1955, the then Prime Minister Sir John Kotelawala laid the foundation stone for the college.
The new technical college later came to the fore and the courses commenced. The major course was Junior Technical Officers Course (Presently NDT).
Other courses included; Survey and Levelling, Draftsmanship, Telecommunication and Signallars, Building Construction, Geology, Preliminary Engineering Science, etc. A Registrar was appointed to look into the all aspects of the technical college.
In 1967, this was made an institute of practical technology when Dudly Senanayake was at the helm of the country. When Sirimavo Bandaranaike came into power in 1970, MP Wimalasiri de Mel made a request to the Premier to elevate this institute to a University. Some of the courses were taken out and the JTO was changed to National Diploma in Technology (NDT).
During the past 58 years, since commencing the academic studies as a technical college, its contribution towards the technical and engineering fields are immense. It has produced men and women of great calibre who have shone in all the fields that they represented, nationally and internationally.

No connection to Lalith, Anusha conviction
Welikada Prison hospital Medical Officer Dr.P.M.Senadheera said that there is no connection between the charges against the acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison hospital Dr.N.Thenuwara and the imprisonment of the ex-Secretary to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita convicted in the Sil Redi case.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said there have been a number of malpractices at the prison hospital over the past three years. But,Dr.N.Thenuwara tries to show that she was transferred because Palpita and Weerathunga were admitted to the prison hospital. However, this is untgrue and a distortion of the facts which is against medical ethics.
No action was taken against malpractices that took place at the Prison hospital over the past three years eventhough we have made several requests to the Prisons Minister and the Health Minister.That is why we have again handed over a report with 26 charges to Minister Senaratne, which outlines the details of professional misconduct by the current Acting Chief Medical Officer.
The Health Minister has accepted our memorandum and handed it over to the CID for further investigation.
The Health Minister had instructed the Acting Director General of Health Services Dr.Jayasundara Bandara to transfer the Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital to the National Hospital following discussions with us. Dr.J.K.Malwatta will be appointed as the Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital until the vacancy of the Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital is filled.
Dr.N.Thenuwara was transferred to avoid any interference with the investigations.
This transfer to the National Hospital has been granted to her with affect from last January, but it was not implemented. Her appointment is also wrong because there had been two senior doctors who were more suitable for the post,Dr.Senadheera said.
There was an investigation to probe rampant malpractices at the Prison hospital earlier following our requests to the Health Minister.
Accordingly, several persons responsible for the charges were transferred on the recommendation of the investigation report and appointed Dr.N.Thenuwara as acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison hospital. But, malpractices have not end enventhough this doctors was also appointed to the post, he added.

Heated argument erupts over COPE Chairmans alleged breach of standing orders
A heated argument erupted yesterday in Parliament when government MP Ashu Marasinghe charged that COPE Chairman Sunil Handunetti has acted against standing orders, while the opposition charged that MP Handunetti has been subjected to undue influence by the government. Referring to a media statement by MP Handunetti that said COPE would start investigations on alleged frauds on central expressway, MP Marasinghe said making the statement was wrong as the oversight committee has to discuss the matter while the Auditor General also must look into it.
Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake said there was no legal impediment for the COPE to investigate into the matter. He said a member is free to talk about the future plans of COPE.
Joint opposition MP Aluthgamage said MP Handunetti has been subjected to undue influence by the government.
The objective of the government is to silence Handunetti, he said. Handunetti was called to Speakers room and a minister attempted to influence him,he said.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said anything like that did not happen.
Myself, MP Handunetti, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella had a discussion on the matter, the Speaker said.
We also sought the opinion of the Auditor General. No undue influence was exerted on anyone, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said COPE could carry out any investigation, while powers of oversight committee and other committees such as COPE could be sought out latter. He said amendments could be made to standing orders if necessary.
Arundika switches allegiance
UPFA Parliamentarian Arundika Fernando crossed over to the Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday after making a statement in Parliament.
He said he was not invited to attend the ceremony organised when the Tourism Development Authority Chairman was appointed. He said the funds of the Tourism Development Ministry was not utilised for the development of the tourism industry. The Finance Ministry had taken away the money, he said.
Fernando said the people had faith in the good governance government that health, educational and development strategies would be implemented and poverty eradicated. However, the situation went from bad to worse. Even the SAITM issue was allowed to fester when it could have been nipped in the bud, he said.
When he had spoken up against these issues, he was removed from his ministerial post, he said.
He was removed from his Ministerial portfolios as
He was Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Deputy Minister, and was removed by President Maithripala Sirisena on September 12.
Fernando vowed to work together with the Joint Opposition towards the toppling of the government.
In a bid to minimise road accidents
Minister proposes trolley cycles to replace three wheelers
Trolley cycles which are being used in over 16 countries, could replace three wheelers minimising the number of road accidents, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this comment during the second reading debate of the Motor Traffic (Amendment) Bill when it was taken up in Parliament for debate yesterday.
Minister de Silva said the government intends to make amendments to the Motor Traffic Bill.
He said in keeping with new technology, the government intends to improve the vehicle registration process, issuing of licences, and renew the laws.
He said discussions were held with experts in the field, including public representatives. In the event of penalty points of drivers reach a certain level, their licences would be cancelled.
This system is followed internationally, he said.
We need to implement the system in the country. The Motor Traffic Act needs to be amended to implement the system, he said.
The current Act does not contain provisions to register motor homes, Trolley cycles and caravans. The Amendments to the Motor Traffic Act will allow for the registration of these Trolley cycles facilitating a safer service. Many fatal accidents are reported due to three wheelers. Trolley cycles could replace the three wheelers. Introducing safer modes of transport is the responsibility of the government, he said.
In terms of the issuance of driving licences, Minister Siripala de Silva said only physical fitness of a driver was considered in issuing a driving licence. He said the government intends to probe a persons mental health too in the future in issuing driving licences.
He said there are no laws in place concerning the transporting of dangerous materials. Those transporting dangerous materials need to be far more vigilant and careful. The current law also does not specify that a sign should be displayed on the vehicle when transporting dangerous or hazardous materials, he said.
Minister de Silva said a driver is compelled to pay fines of traffic offence at a post office. The government intends to make the system easier where fines could be paid using simpler electronic modes of payment, he said.
The minister said stringent regulations will be brought in for the regulation of three wheelers to ensure better safety measures. He said measures would also be brought in to improve public transport.
Vanni District TNA- MP Charles Nirmalanathan said his party would support to measures taken to minimise road accidents. He commended the Transport Minister for measures taken to make it mandatory for all three wheelers to have meters fixed as some three wheeler drivers charge exorbitant amounts even for short distances.
He urged the Transport Minister to recruit the Tamil youth in the North to fill the vacancies in the Transport Board (SLTB). He said there are many rehabilitated youth who are unemployed.
Commending the measures taken by the Transport Minister, UPFA Galle District MP Mohan Priyadharshana Silva said most of these proposals to improve the transport sector were most welcome. He said increased fines have not contributed to the reduction of accidents.
He said the attitudes of the people need to be changed. He said no driver willfully causes accidents. He said sometimes, accidents occur due to technical faults of the vehicle. He suggested revisions in traffic fines.
Moves to increase the number of High Court judges
The government yesterday moved a motion to amend the Judicature Act to increase the number of high court judges from 75 to 85.
The amendment Bill was moved by Justice Minister Talata Atukorala.
As of March 2017, the number of cases pending in the Civil Appellate High Courts was 5,749, in the Commercial High Courts, it was 5,580. As of March 2017, the number of cases pending in the High Courts was 16,574. The number of judges serving in the courts to resolve the cases is only 75. The amendment to the Judicature Act to enable the increase of the approved cadre of 75 High Court Judges up to 85, to expedite the cases pending, was approved by the Cabinet.
Bills prior to LG elections soon to Parliament
Bills required to be submitted to Parliament prior to holding of the Local Government elections will be presented to Parliament expeditiously, Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella said in Parliament yesterday.
He said this in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake.
In response to the Prime Ministers assurance that the Local Government elections would be held in January next year, Dissanayake said to hold the elections, the Township Ordinance, Urban Council Ordinance, Pradeshiya Sabha Ordinance and the Pradeshiya Sabha and Urban Council Establishment Ordinance should be subjected to Parliamentary approval. Minister Kiriella in response said measures would be taken to present the ordinances to Parliament shortly.

Parliament adjourned due to tense situation - UPDATED

A tense situation erupted in the Parliament today when Joint Opposition members stormed into the well of the House in protest of moving the second reading debate on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill.
The Speaker Karu Jauasuriya adjourned Parliamentary proceedings for around two hours to reach to a decision on the continuation of the debate on the bill.
The Speaker suspended the sittings at around 11.20 am.
Following a meeting held with the participation of the Speaker, party leaders, Premier and Attorney General the sittings resumed at 1.30 pm.
The Speaker announced that there arent any legal objections to continue the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill and the debate continued. 
However while the Joint Opposition members rushed and stood shouting in the well before the sittings suspended, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa commenced the debate and continued the speech.
Opposition member M. A. Sumanthiran delivered a speech next.
However the sittings were suspended temporarily by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya around 11.20 am until a decision is reached whether to continue the debate or not following Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe's submission.
Premier said while MP M. A. Sumanthiran was delivering his speech that the Speaker could decide to suspend the sittings or allow MP Sumanthiran to finish his speech and then suspend sittings.
"However the Attorney General would come to Parliament after 12 noon," Premier said.
The Speaker decided to suspend sittings after MP Sumanthiran winds up his speech. 
However when the notifications of the Motions and the Orders of the day commenced, Joint Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawrdena stated that the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill is related to the Provincial Councils and it has not been directed to the Provincial Councils yet.
He added that Speaker should deliver a ruling on it. MP Wimal Weerawansa also raising a point of order maintained the same view.
The Speaker responded that there is no need to direct the same to Provincial Councils and that is the expected ruling.
Joint Opposition Member Namal Rajapaksa said that it was not fair to have moved the bill to the morning and to have taken the vote in the evening, similar to the bill relating to the matters of the Provincial Councils.
He requested the Speaker to discuss the matter with party leaders and Prime Minister and deliver a ruling.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that a meeting will be held at 12 noon with party leaders, Prime Minister and the Attorney General and suggested to continue the debate until then.
At this occasion Joint Opposition MP Gamini Lokuge pointed out that a Parliamentary Oversight Committee and Chairman was appointed in relation to this bill. But these amendments have not been directed to the Committee at any stage.
Joint Opposition MP Keheliya Rambukwella demanded to submit the views of the Attorney General before the Parliament and the Speaker Jayasuriya said that he would do so at the proper moment.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Musthapa said that as powers bestowed on him as the Minister he could bring amendments to the Act any moment.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma stated that when it was queried on Tuesday if the government informed the Provincial Councils on the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill the Leader of the House did not answer.
At this stage Leader of the House and Minister Kiriella stated that the same matter was in the reserved list so it was not necessary to direct it before the Provincial Councils.
"The 18th amendment to the constitution was moved in the morning and was passed in the evening," Minister Kiriella said.
"Was that fair. Can you remember how it was passed"
The Speaker observed that it was not necessary to send the amendments to the Oversight Committee.
So the debate could be commenced.
When Minister Faizer Musthpa commenced the debate, Joint Opposition members stormed into the well in protest.
MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Dullas Alahapperuma, Keheliya Rambukkwella, Wimal Weerawansa, Tharaka Balasooriya, Udaya Gammanpila, Kumara Welgama, Lohan Ratwatta, Wimalaweera Dissanayake, Arundika Fernando, Namal Rajapaksa, Shehan Semasinghe etc rushed into the well and stood before the Speakers bench in protest and began to shout while Minister Musthapa continued his speech.
Thereafter Opposition member MA Sumanthiran joined the debate while the Joint Opposition members remained in the well shouting.
However during his speech Sumanthiran was seen interacting with the members in the well. Some of the member were seen responding to MP Sumanthiran and latter recalled the stance of MP Gammanpila in the Supreme Court on the Provincial Councils.
"MP Gammanpila's counsels maintained in Supreme Court that Provincial Councils were sovereign," MP Sumanthiran said.
However National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva raising a point of order said that the Provincial Councils are not sovereign.
While MP Sumanthiran was in his feet the Premier attended and submitted his views and later the sittings was suspended until around 11.20 after the member wound up his speech.
The sittings resumed at 1.30 pm and Speaker observed that the party leaders, Premier and the Attorney General met in the Parliamentary Complex.
He also observed that according to the views of the Attorney general there is no need to inquire the views of the Provincial Councils on the matter.On the other matter so far amendments to a Bill have not been submitted before the Parliamentary Oversight Committees and so it is not necessary to submit the amendments before the Parliamentary Oversight Committee, MP Sumanthiran said.
He added that the Bill has been submitted before the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on September this year.
At this stage MP Weerawansa said that the amendments are three folds bigger than the bill itself and MP Lokuge said that the one we passed here is not the one we discussed at the Parliamentary Oversight Committee.
At this stage Leader of the House Kiriella said that MP Dinesh Gunawardena agreed there at the meeting to continue.
"The Bill to be passed is not what discussed at the Oversight Committee," said MP Namal Rajapaksa.
"There is a representative of the Attorney General here in Parlimentary Complex to get the views," said Minister Kiriella in response.
The debate was re-commenced by Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera.

PM Challenges JO to contest under new party
There wouldnt be a single Joint Opposition member in Parliament after January next year provided they contested the Local Government election from a party other than Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
Stating that the Local Government election will be held in January next year, while the party leaders could decide on the provincial council polls later,the Premier also requested the Joint Opposition members to assist the UPFA and thereafter the Government could function smoothly without disturbance.
The Premier also questioned as to how Joint Opposition members could support some other party at an election. Thereafter their party membership would be cancelled, Premier Wickremesinghe said. So I ask the the Joint Opposition members to support the UPFA and we can function after January peacefully.
He made these observations yesterday making a Ministerial Statement in Parliament.
He said Local Government elections could only be held January next year because of GCE Ordinary Level Examination which would be held in mid December this year and because of the budget. He said the Ministry of Education has requested that the polls should not be held in December this year.
Premier said further that the Parliament agreed to hold the Local Government election under a mixed electoral system of First-Past-the-Post (FPP) representation and Proportional Representation(PR).
He said that to introduce this system meeting justice to all, the government had to take long. But those who criticized preferential vote system earlier attempted to criticize the governments endeavor to introduce a just system to take petty political mileage.
The government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and United National Party(UNP) is not afraid of elections, Premier said. But if the opposition is afraid of the elections, just let us know.
Further the Prime Minister said the local government polls were delayed as there were many issues to be resolved.  The previous government had created wards where there were no proper population. These were done in order to get political mileage Premier said. For example as the previous government could not win the ward where Sirikotha is located they attempted to make it a multi-ward although over 95 percent of the population in the ward were Sinhalese.
Further he said this government will be able to bring in a new mixed electoral system for the local bodies based on a ward system.  We have also been able to secure the small parties, minority groups and ensure a fair representation for women in all local bodies Premier said.
The Premier also assured that the mixed electoral system will be extended to provincial councils and parliamentary elections as well. He added that all changes would be done with the consent of all parties.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa then queried as to when the provincial council could be held. We also would like to know as to when the government intends to hold the provincial council election whose terms end next month, Parliamentarian Rajapaksa queried. The Election Commission has said it would be possible to hold elections to these councils in December this year.
Prime Minister who responded said the issues of GCE Ordinary Level exam and the budget will pop up for this election as well.  We will have to talk with the polls chief and political parties on this issue the Prime Minister said.
He said further that these facts have been submitted to the Election Commission and a date would be decided for the election in January. However as the Joint Opposition members attempted to shout as the Premier commenced his statement, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya observed that members should allow any member on his feet to express his views.

President participates in UN political reform meeting
President Maithripala Sirisena and several world leaders participated in the United Nations Political Reform High Level Event at the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) chamber at the UN General Assembly building on Monday.
This event was held under the patronage of US President Donald Trump and it was followed by a participants' photograph.This ECOSOC Session focused specifically on how the Council can further support the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
US President Donald Trump gave his first speech to the United Nations on Monday morning, during a panel on reforming the organization.In recent years, the United Nations has not reached its full potential because of bureaucracy and mismanagement, President Trump said.
We encourage the secretary general to fully use his authority to cut through the bureaucracy, reform outdated systems, and make firm decisions to advance the UNs core mission.
The United Nations was founded on truly noble goals, he said. The United Nations has helped advance these goals in so many ways: feeding the hungry, providing disaster relief, and empowering women and girls in many societies all across the world.
As the high-level week of the United Nations General Assembly gets underway, Secretary-General Antnio Guterres stressed the role of the UN to help reshape unproductive and unrewarding finance and redirect investment to creating a better world for all.
The choices we make on finance will be critical, Guterres told this special event held at the UN Headquarters in New York on financing for global development goals.
Guterres noted that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  adopted by UN Member States in September 2015  are a blueprint for building an inclusive, sustainable fair globalization.
We can choose to bemoan the lack of financing for the 2030 Agenda in a world awash with so much unproductive and unrewarding finance. Or we can grasp the opportunity to reshape finance, according to our urgent, collective needs, he said.
The choice is clear. Let us invest in the 2030 Agenda and finance a better world for all.
However, todays global financial system, which manages some $300 trillion in financial assets, is simply not fit for purpose, the UN chief said, recalling that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted in 2015 at an international conference in the Ethiopian capital on financing for development, highlights the importance of being innovative in leveraging resources and financing for development.

PSG win again but tensions simmer between Neymar, Cavani
Paris: Paris Saint-Germain kept their perfect start to the season going on Sunday, but the 2-0 win over Lyon also laid bare certain tensions in their all-star front line.
PSG were leading 1-0 at the Parc des Princes when they won a penalty with 10 minutes remaining for a foul on Kylian Mbappe, making his home debut.
Having already scored three times from the spot this season, Edinson Cavani assumed the responsibility would once again be his.
Neymar tried to get the ball from the Uruguayan but it was Cavani who eventually took it. And his effort was brilliantly saved, Anthony Lopes tipping the ball onto the bar.
"The penalties are taken by a couple of players, one is Cavani and the other is Neymar. There needs to be a gentleman's agreement on the pitch to decide who takes the penalties," coach Unai Emery admitted later.
"We will sort things out internally for the next time, because I think they are both capable of taking them, and I want the two of them to mix up who takes them."
Those comments, and the fact Cavani was unsuccessful from the spot, suggests Neymar will get his chance in future.
Cavani himself tried to play down any rift telling Uruguayan radio this kind of thing happened all the time in football.
"I dont know why people believe these stories. The truth is this kind of thing is normal, something that happens in football," Cavani told Uruguays Radio Universal.
"The truth is theres no problem at all."
"He (Neymar) just arrived, he will surely emerge more and more. As Ive said from the very beginning, we all have the positivity and willingness to help him adapt in the best way possible. I think he has shown hes adapting quickly," said Cavani.
The Brazilian had previously tried and failed to grab the ball from Cavani when a penalty was awarded in the 3-0 win over Saint-Etienne last month. Cavani scored that time.
Earlier in Sunday's game, the duo disagreed over who should take a free-kick with the match still goalless. Dani Alves intervened to give his compatriot the ball on that occasion, and Neymar's strike was saved.
"They are two great players. They want to score goals. There are no problems between them, everything is fine," insisted PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe.
Most coaches would envy the embarrassment of riches at Emery's disposal.
The 'MCN' front line of Mbappe, Cavani and Neymar has cost the capital club 466 million euros ($557 million, 411 million) but now the coach has to somehow keep them all happy.
Cavani scored a remarkable 49 goals in all competitions last season and already has nine this season -- it would have been 10 had the opener against Lyon not been credited as a Marcelo own goal.
But Cavani, who previously lived in the shadow of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, has seen PSG commit the two biggest transfer fees in history to sign Neymar and Mbappe.
And 222 million-euro man Neymar has come to Paris to be the main man after spending four years in Lionel Messi's shadow at Barcelona.
"This victory has exposed tensions between Neymar and Cavani," said sports daily L'Equipe on its front page on Monday.
The 'MCN' scored eight goals between them in their first two matches together against Metz (5-1) and Celtic (5-0), but Sunday was less encouraging.
Cavani saw very little of the ball, while Neymar and Mbappe were relatively subdued, even if they combined to force PSG's second on the night, a Jeremy Morel own goal.
Julian Draxler, a 40 million-euro signing from Wolfsburg in January, was also shoehorned into the team on Sunday but overloading the side with attacking stars is to the detriment of the overall balance.
PSG have not slipped up yet, but Sunday's game showed that Emery has plenty on his plate. AFP

PTA was not used for past six months: Sagala
The Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) will be replaced soon with a new counter terrorism law, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said in Parliament yesterday.
The Minister also said that the PTA has not been used for the past six months.
He added that the initial steps in that connection has been commenced.
He also added that a Parliamentary Committee has also given its views on the same.
Minister Ratnayaka made this observation in response to a query made by Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila for oral answers.
The Minister also said that 695 persons had been arrested since 2013 under the PTA. When MP Gammanpila queried whether such a number of persons had been arrested under the PTA because there is a threat of terrorism, the Minister said that those persons had been arrested on suspicion of their involvement in terrorist related activities.
The Minister also added that some of them have also been released after magisterial inquiries. Cases have been filed cases some suspects on counts other than those coming under the PTA it was revealed during investigations.
The Minister queried if there was such a threat how could the government remain without making any arrest under the PTA.

Railway Operation Supervisory Officers launch token strike
The Alliance of the Railway Operation Supervisory Officers Union yesterday announced a 48-hour token strike beginning from todays midnight.
The Union comprising Station Masters, Drivers and Guards decided to launch the token strike in protest of Salary and Cadre Commissions failure to implement the recommendations with regard to their salaries.
Alliance Convenor Lal Ariyarathna said the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry has made recommendations with regard to their salaries, but the Commission shows reluctance to implement the recommendations.
This issue is dragging on since 2010. We have decided to launch the strike as our discussion with the commission failed this evening, he said.
However, Ariyarathna said they are willing to give up their trade union action if the Secretary to the Prime Minister or the President intervenes to solve the issue.
Railway Drivers Union Secretary Indika Dodangoda said the authorities assured them relief measures instead of implementing the ministry recommendation.
We have made the authorities aware of this trade union action two days in advance, he said.

About one thousand acres have been encroached by some people from the Ridiyagama livestock farm, the manager of the farm Dinushika Sulakshith complained to Hambantota District Agricultural Committee.
The livestock farm has 3,200 imported cows and it produces about 3,200 litres of milk. As these encroachers have acquired these lands, there are no lands to cultivate food for these animals.
The manager said these people cultivated plantain in the land, pumping water from the main canal supplying water to Ridiyagama tank which runs through the farm as well as from the tank.
Hambantota Additional District Secretary Suneth Lochana instructed Ambalantota Assistant Divisional Secretary to look into this matter and take necessary steps.

It says the lyrics, about the size of the Belgium striker's penis, are "offensive and discriminatory".
"Racist stereotypes are never acceptable, irrespective of any intention to show support for a player," said Kick It Out.
A United blog has already asked the club's fans to refrain from the song. "It's a cheap and insulting stereotype that has no place in this day and age," United fan Scott Patterson wrote in a post on The Republik of Mancunia. BBC

Milan: Italian motorcycling ace Valentino Rossi has returned to training just 18 days after suffering a double leg fracture, his Movistar Yahama team confirmed.
Rossi underwent surgery in Ancona, in eastern Italy, on September 1, a day after a crash in training, discharging himself from hospital the following day.
The 38-year-old rode his first couple of laps around the Misano circuit on Monday before the session was cut short by rain, his team said.
The evaluation of Rossis physical condition was inconclusive, the team said with a decision expected midweek on whether the veteran will attempt to take part in this weekends Aragon MotoGP.
If Rossi cannot compete his place should be taken by Dutch Superbike rider Michael van der Mark.
Rossi missed the San Marino Grand Prix but remains fourth in the standings, 42 points behind world champion Marc Marquez of Spain and Italys Andrea Dovizioso with five rounds to go. AFP

Sadaharitha marks Ozone Day
The International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer was held on September 16 and Sadaharitha Plantations, as a leader in the business of commercial forestryl commemorated the occasion by inviting the nation to join hands with them and contribute to making our planet green and fertile.
Afforestation is a cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that endanger the fragile shield of gas protecting the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Without this delicate Ozone Layer, life will not exist on the planet.
The date commemorates the 1987 signing of the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the Ozone Layer. This year the theme is Ozone Layer Protection The Mission Goes On.Controlled use of ozone-depleting substances has contributed significantly to global efforts to address climate change, protecting the planets ecosystems for future generations.
The Chairman of Sadaharitha, Sathish Navarathna explained Our Company has over 2000 acres of forestry and our business has thrived for 15 years where we grow Sandalwood, Teak, Mahogany, Rambutan and most importantly Agarwood that has great potential to earn foreign exchange for the country. Over 26,000 customers have invested in our commercial forestry and are contributing to reducing greenhouse carbon emission directly. As a responsible and ethical business organization, we always value the concept of people, planet and profit which will lead us into a sustainable future for us and our progeny.
One way some tropical countries are reducing deforestation is through participation in the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) programme. REDD essentially works to establish incentives for the people who care for the forest to manage it sustainably while still being able to benefit economically. Efforts of Sadaharitha to cultivate commercial forestry are a good example.
The Company has provided either employment or income generating opportunities to nearly one thousand villagers living in areas close to Sadaharitha forestry projects in the low country wet zone areas.
Our efforts are not restricted to a special day or two, but throughout we practice eco friendly habits. The future of business organizations lies upon how well they respond to preserving the environment within their operations.
While many other companies are striving to do this, we are already there Navarathna further added.

SAYS TENDER BOARD DECIDED ON RS.10.5 BN BONDS
Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran testifying before the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday said he was in full agreement with the Tender Board decision taken on February 27, 2015 auction to accept 10.5 billion bids.
Mahendran also disagreed with the Auditor Generals position that a loss was incurred by the government at the said auction. Mahendran also expressed his disagreement with Auditor Generals loss calculation in his special audit report on the Treasury bond issue. Mahendran also stated that he was not involved in the decision making processes of March 29 and 31, 2016 auctions, under the Commissions probe.
Mahendrans legal representative, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva made a submission reserving their rights to withdraw from giving evidence at any point that his client was not treated with dignity and fairness. De Silva PC pointed that Mahendran is not legally inclined to testify before the Commission since he is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.Mahendran gave evidence before the Commission on changes he made at the Central Bank when he was appointed as the Governor and also reasoned out why he thought public auction was a better method to raise debts more than the private placement method. He also gave evidence on the decision making process of the February 27,2015 auction. He also gave reasons for walking into a Market Operations Committee meeting on the same day morning, which was chaired by Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe.
Mahendran said following his appointment, he wanted to address serious issues in the Central Bank which has caused the CBSL to incur losses up to Rs. 39 billion in 2013 and 2014.
Speaking of the backdrop at which the February 27, 2015 auction was held, Mahendran said the biggest economic issue the newly appointed government faced in 2015 was the large debts it had to service. For March 2015, the government requirement was Rs. 72 billion which was a large sum of money, and drastic actions were necessary to meet the demand, Mahendran said.

Senaratna raises APTS capital from Rs 500 to Rs 1 bn
Although he did not even know what a data card or a mother board would do in a computer, Namal Senaratna decided to be entrepreneur in the ICT sector with great hope.
Soon after leaving school (Ananda MMV Elpitiya), he joined a mercantile firm dealing in computers in 2001, to get to know some finer points of the trade.
After a few months, Senaratna thought he knew enough and got about setting up his own store in Colombo. He also managed to get a bank loan to start his business and invested heavily.
However, his entrepreneurial skill was not enough to stay afloat in the competitive business arena in the city and he was forced to shut down and almost go into hiding as he had a huge debt of Rs. 1.6 million in 2007.
His second child was also born differently abled and it was too much for him to absorb. I seriously though of committing suicide as I did not see a future. But then I thought of my family responsibilities and decided to look for a way out and nothing else came to my mind other than computer-related business.
Since he and his family were staying with friends, he found it difficult to get even Rs. 500 needed for a new company registration. "Luckily for me, an old customer called me and I sold him a network card for Rs. 100 and registered Asia Pacific Technology Systems (Private) Limited (APTS) in August 2008 as an IT solutions provider in Sri Lanka and stated operations again on October 1," he said.
With the greatest difficulty I managed to secure a computer service contract for Rs. 124,000 with Arpico as my first assignment.
He recalled that when he received the contract cheque he once again faced a problem as almost all the banks had blacklisted him and he did not have a bank to encash the cheque. Finally I managed to deal with NDB and started accepting other bigger service contracts of this nature.
"During this time, I saw a turnaround and also invested in higher education including a university degree for myself in the ICT industry. My business initially focused mainly on small scale businesses to cater to the void existing in the personnel systems market and to fulfill ever demanding customer requirements," the APTS owner said.
A major breakthrough during that time was securing a contract with Orido Telecom of the Maldives to conduct a CISCO workshop for their employees. I must also say that the current contract I secured with British Telecom too is one of my greatest achievements.
"Today, APTS is on the brink of celebrating its ninth anniversary soon - on October 1 - and we now have some of the worlds top names dealing with us, including DHL, Habib Bank, CISCO, AIA, Virtusa and many more," Senaratna said.
Today, when Sri Lankan and global businesses need turnkey solutions to stay competitive, APTS has become their preferred provider for corporate and business customers.
Some of the largest and most sophisticated integrated systems commissioned in Sri Lanka in every sector of the economy rely on solutions implemented by APTS, Senaratna said.
Following its success in the small and medium sector, the company quickly gained more recognition and moved on to serve the medium sized industry, which opened doors to more demanding and competitive operations.
With a 30 member staff, APTS is now a fully-fledged internationally recognised corporate in scope, strength, as well as revenue and is growing rapidly. We are now popularly referred to as 'APTS' and our target is a turnover of Rs. one billion by the end of this year and Rs 2.5 billion by 2020, Senaratna said.
The company passed the Rs. 450 million revenue target last year. Looking back as to how I found Rs. 500 to register my business, I can say our success is due to sheer hard work.
I think our motto Right things for the right reasons too was part of our success.
I must also pay tribute to my wife, Ayesha Sethunge, who has been a tower of strength and stayed and guided me along with my two kids. The second daughter whom I believe brought me much luck is now receiving advanced medical treatment and is turning out be an almost normal child.
The company has also won a haul of awards and recognition, both locally and globally. These include the Most Emerging Entrepreneur 2014 at Enterprise Asia in February 2014 in Colombo; Cisco Sales Award by Cisco Systems in November 2015; Top SME in Asia award presented by Mors Group, Malaysia, in November 2016, at the Asia Corporate Excellence and Sustainability Awards (ACES) in Singapore; World Leader Businessperson award in 2016 presented by the World Confederation of Business in Morocco; EMC Valued Partner 2015 award by EMC Corporation in January 2016; and Excellent Sustainable Development Award presented by the United Nations Friendship Organization in August 2016 at the International Youth Day in Colombo.
"It is a remarkable honour to win this Cisco sales awards in Oslo, Norway, for the third time, because it represents a new measure of the value of business architecture that balances beauty with performance and productivity."
Our next aim is to expand to the African continent and we are currently looking at a joint venture.
At a time when most new IT companies struggle to face high tide to even survive the first two years, Namal Senaratna has taken his company through challenging times and says that young entrepreneurs should start with little capital and staff but with big ideas and dedication to be among the profitable.

SFs claim must be probed
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has been denied a visa to attend the UN sessions in New York, in the company of President Maithripala Sirisena, it is being reported. Fonseka told journalists, in Kelaniya, on Monday, that the fallout from human rights violations, during the war, by a few personnel in military, apparently has taken a toll on him as well, being denied a visa to travel to the US.
He stood by his comments, made a few days ago, that those who committed atrocities and human rights violations in the military should be brought to justice, by the local courts, as against any international court of justice or war crimes tribunal. He said, the misconduct by a few (in the military) has obviously blackened the image of the entire army. It was only a handful of officers who engaged in misdemeanours, with the rest of the military, numbering several thousands, too being painted with the same brush and made to suffer the consequences.
Fonseka's comments, of course, set the cat among the pigeons, with members of the Joint Opposition, and sections of the Sangha, rushing with their knives out, accusing Fonseka of betraying the war heroes'. The protesters also charged Fonseka with playing to the agenda of the Tamil diaspora and that his comments were calculated to coincide with the UN sessions in Geneva.
Why, pray, have these groups got so excited, for a comment, which could have been made by any rational individual,with a sense of justice, and, who valued the rule of law. Fonseka could not have made his allegation lightly and without good reasons. As army commander, he, no doubt, would have been privy to certain goings on by certain lower ranking officers down the command chain. Fonseka, it was, who came out with the revelation of safe houses manned by military officers, operating in the city, to carry out abductions and target journalists. Then too there was a huge betrayal outcry by the same elements, who are at it again, over the former army commander's remark. Are they insisting that the law look the other way, for no other reasons than that these perpetrators of heinous crimes are war heroes and should necessarily be out of the law's reach Are there groups and individuals in this country who are more equal before the law than others
There are media reports, almost daily, of some ex-serviceman or other being involved in murder, rape, gang robbery and other crimes. Are those who have taken exception to Fonseka's comments insisting that these criminals be left to their own devices, because they waged war against the LTTE and protected the country's sovereignty Will this not lead to a state of anarchy, with the complete breakdown of the rule of law
None of those who are today in the vanguard, protesting the betrayal of war heroes, anywhere to be seen, when the war winning army commander was dragged away like a common criminal and thrown behind bars, after being hauled before a kangaroo court. Nor was there a whimper of protest, when, members of the military were forced to kneel on the driveway of a hotel, where Sarath Fonseka was billeted, after his Presidential Election defeat, for the crime of offering protection to their one-time commander. Where were these great patriots, today weeping buckets for the betrayal of war heroes, when scores of military officers of the Sinha Regiment took flight to foreign countries, being hunted by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, including the present army commander
These pseudo patriots are wrong if they think the public could be fooled by their gimmicks. They (the public) have not forgotten how army personnel were made to sell vegetables and clean drains in the city beautification project of Gota. Not only that, the promised retirement benefits to the disabled soldiers too were left in abeyance, leaving the Yahapalanaya government saddled with the problem, with the JO not losing an opportunity to bring these hapless souls onto the streets, in a bid to whip up public emotion.
Sarath Fonseka should be commended for his bold stand, although he had obviously not won many friends, even among the government ranks. Criminals in uniform should be exposed and punished, if for no other reason than to hold the scales of justice even. We often hear of rogue police officers being brought before the law and punished for their criminal acts. The army cannot be an exception.
The police too played a not inconsiderable part in defeating terrorism and made immense sacrifices. In fact it was the police who were the first on the firing line in the nascent stages of the Eelam war and suffered many casualties when police stations were overrun by the terrorists.
The government, on its part, should pursue investigations in earnest against complaints of serious crimes and human rights violations directed at any military officer, irrespective of rank. This, while ensuring justice to the aggrieved, would also obviate the need for any foreign courts in the country.

Shakespeares space
The immense power of Shakespeare lies in his ability to inspire all. If he was the greatest dramatist that lived, he was also the educator of English to the world. He did not stop there. He played a major role in standardizing spelling and grammar that led to proper pronunciation. He inspired a string of high-profile composers and writers like Goethe and Charles Dickens. He resurrected history with many lapses in his plays because he was not a historian.
He selected fables from Italian romances or from ancient chronicles or even from remote England of his time. He discovered Greeks obedient to tradition and therefore Greece was hardly the backdrop to his writing as tradition did not sit upon his writing. Strange and supernatural was fine by him because we come across illusions that surround love and emotion or sexual subjection often transcended the frailty of love.
Never looked seriously nor positively which was a reason being his forced marriage to Anne, the woman who never rose to his literary knowledge that made Shakespeare look at women as monstrous, murderous, suicidal, homicidal, ambitious, vengeful, etc. These female characters are rampant in his plays.
Yet, his thoughts are brilliant, beautiful, intriguing and poignant. They held the world in awe and still does.
What made him the phenomenon he is. Nature and her inhabitants as he lucidly explains in turning points in many sequences in his plays that can be termed as:- endorsements to the convention but often with reaction to his mind. In As You Like It, Shakespeare explain lifes journey very vividly:
THE SEVEN AGES: All the worlds a stage, And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time play many parts.
He acts being seven ages
WOODLAND BIRDS: The ousel-cock, so black of hue, with orange tawny bill.
The throstle with his note so true, the wren with little quill
The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
The plain-song cuckoo grey
How spacious were his words
How real his approach as he spread magic in everything that connected his life when he meandered through lifes long journey. The seasons and their diversity sat in his writing and imagination. Effortlessly, the brilliance sought and gifted their endless boundless beauty so he may glorify their wonders.
NATURES WONDER: Full many a glorious morning have I seen
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy
However, different schools of thought support his ideologies of preserving the original Shakespearian English he used in dialogue, drama, prose, poetry, verse, sonnets, etc. There had always been an object of his writing no matter how scholars construed them. The tradition was never his forte though radical contemporaries tried hard as they did to destructively critize his writing and when to the extent sneering at the composed and constituted the non-competitive era he created in a relentless school of ideology.
So colossal was their impact and made other poets appear dull and listless when nature in her glory offered the best of all four seasons so much so that even winter had little flowers peering through crevices in search of day light only to die upon winter blast but not before Shakespeare caught a glimpse of them. He was able to appreciate their contribution in some small way.
He was by birth and instinct a countryman and raised in the native Warwickshire among the environment that made early impressions in his young mind he carried through to his writings. His parents from both sides belonged to farming families and not far his birthplace, Stratford-upon-Avon which at that time was a little market town. It linked the River Avon the poet cherished, holding back memories with snow-white gliding swans beside the open fields and pastures. As he grew up in the freshness of the rural and left behind Stratford when London beckoned him where he made his fortune and name as a poet, Shakespeare remained the man from the native village that divided the Arden woodlands and forests. Very often he wandered in the land at Welcomb on her rising ground looking beyond the river valley and perhaps made his fortune as playwright and part owner of the Globe Theatre.
Over twenty nine scenes containing flowers and foliage are found in his writing adding so much beauty and character upon his wondrous writings.
He was such an accurate observer never missing any detail as to their individuality that made him a natural botanist.
Where the bee sucks, there suck !
In a cowslips bell I lie.
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bats back I do fly
After summer merrily.
Beautiful and simple are these wonders of a childs world of imagination that Shakespeare wrote for them with flying bats, sleeping fairies, crying owls surrounded by nature and her flowers of spring. I can count up to twenty-five flowers named by the poet across his plays and they are all found in the woodlands of Warwickshire during the four seasons and belong to the Bard, I suppose. The ones used in the article are Pansies, Daffodils, Lilies and Oxlips and their photographs original.
For children, he was a favourite in the only play written from them. In Tempst, he uses the cowslip where Ariel would curl and lie, denoting their size.
The Fawn AND FLORA:- The tail-wagging animals that show affection and trust such as dear and domesticated or street dogs, groveling and lavishing caresses and all plants characteristics of composite flowers and flowers of particular epoch reminding us of Fauna, the Godess of Flowers. ..
THE ROSE:- Of all flowers, Methinks a Rose is best
It is the very emblem of a maid.
For when the west winds court her gently,
How modestly she blows and paints the sun
With her chaste blushes. When the North winds hears her
Rude and impatient, then like chastity,
She locks her beauties in her bud again.
And leaves him to base briers.
One can still experience and see what life was like for the young Shakespeare growing up in Stratford-upon-Avon at his home in Henley Street where the garden still contains many plants, herbs and flowers as were in his time many of whom are mentioned by him in his plays.
In the Chancel of the Holy Trinity Church are found the graves of William Shakespeare, Anne Hathaway, Thomas Nash, Dr. John Hall and his wife Susanna Shakespeare.
The church contains a fine set of 15th C. Misericords and an ancient chained Holy Bible. It is open all year for visitors to examine and pay their respects to the Shakespeare family as no visit to Stratford-upon-Avon is complete without stopping off at Holy Trinity Church.

Short story: The Ballroom Dance
It was customary to celebrate the annual get-together with song and dance at the youth club with the participation of members of other district clubs. So, all members looked forward to this event with much enthusiasm. The focus was on the first year students. Their participation was vital since this event was specially organised as a camaraderie and no excuses will be entertained, said the Head of the Club.
The second-year members were not so keen since they had participated in the previous annual dance and they considered it just another event. But, it was not so for Jessie a first-year member, she had never ever danced the ballroom before. Everyone should participate in the final event, prizes are galore  said the organizers. This would be her first dance and she pondered as to how she could compete.
Two weeks before the event, she told her mother about it. Oh! mother, I am very nervous and I do not know the ballroom steps and that too dance with someone from the opposite sex, how could I do it she lamented. Mother hid her amusement, she knew her child was a very quiet and shy girl, naturally, she was upset. She had attended a girls school and the youth club of the area was the first place she mingled with boys. Never mind child dont take this seriously, this is only a get-together, so stop worrying, try to learn a few steps from your friend Nina, didnt she win the last time, sure she would help you said she. Her friend was ever ready to help her and they practiced every evening and somehow she learned the steps fast, getting out of her jittery.
Mother altered one of her old evening gowns, a colourful yellow which she had worn for a concert in school. Everything was ready for tomorrow. With a hair-do in a different style and a flower in her hair, with slight make-up for a young girl, Jessie looked more beautiful. Moreover, the yellow colour suited her complexion. The compliments she received when she entered the hall was enough. Her mother had transformed her and her efforts were fruitful. Father only said enjoy yourself, be careful, just give me a buzz, when it is over to pick you up he said.
The illuminations in the hall held an idyllic glow with the lights flashing at different angles with decorations of striking colours, which made the place enchanting for a perfect evening. At the far end, the orchestra was playing sweet music. Most of her friends were already on the dance floor. She looked around for Nina and there she was dancing away dressed in an olive green gown with a tiara in her hair looking very attractive. She tried to distract her attention just to say of her arrival but she paid no attention. Anyway, just as Jessie made way to join her other friends at the table, she noticed a debonair young man she had never met in the youth club before, walk towards her. I marked my time looking out for a beautiful partner now I have found her, shall we dance, he said with a smile taking her hand. She moved to the dance floor as if in a trance. Without faltering in her steps as practiced with Nina, she kept her composure and was floating away like a butterfly. The orchestra was playing non-stop beautiful music and they kept on dancing for a long time. No wonder she was able to dance with ease the man was an experienced dancer. Hey, are you dreaming, do you know that you could dance very well, I am not joking, he said. She hid her amusement and what a thrill she got, then her practices were not in vain.
When they passed Nina, she winked at her, that Jessie missed her step and accidentally stepped on her partner. I think we should take a break for a while, tired isnt it said he, leading her to the table. Enjoying the moment and introducing themselves to the rest of the members, they chatted for a while. The night was swiftly coming to an end, when there was an announcement for the masked dance and the best couple at the dance would be chosen. The judges were in their seats and the dancers hurriedly put on their masks and different long coats. By this, none could be recognized.
The orchestra played once again and thirty couples were on the floor. Jessie and her partner have so engrossed in their dance that at the end of the beat it was only they who remained on the floor. They were adjudged the best couple of the dance. The cheers and jeers from the gathering when they were garlanded and sashed lasted for some time and it was time for presentations. They received many gifts and bouquets. Is this a dream, I just cannot believe, she thought to herself. This cannot be, I am not that good, it is due to you that we wont she told him. You are mistaken, didnt I tell you that you dance very well, glad I partnered you he replied. Wasnt my first dance great she asked Nina when she was congratulated.
Now, it was time for all to leave and with a simple adieu and a smile her dance partner from nowhere left, handing her the bouquets and all the gifts he received. Oh! I wish this night had never ended thought she, whats this dance anyway, he has stolen my heart. Jessie left with a deep sigh.

Simple yet striking tattoos that youll want on your skin
Ahmet Cambaz had a late start in the tattooing game, but has already proved himself as a formidable ink artist. After 7 years of doing cartoon work for an Istanbul-based magazine, a tattoo equipment set gifted to him in 2013 by his wife caused a shift in his creative vision, and his true craft began to shine through.
Simple, yet sublime, the designs Cambaz produces have a distinctly modern feel, yet also remind us of the whimsical storybooks we used to read as children. "My tattoos are micro style, geometric, and direct," he told Vice Creators.
"We are living in a complicated age. That's why I prefer to create minimalist lines in my pieces... Everything is now needing to become simpler." What the tattoos forgo in colour and convention, they make up for in quiet, understated beauty.

SLFP strong, JO faces uncertain future, says SB
Whatever the Joint Opposition (JO) says, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) has been strengthened to successfully face the forthcoming elections, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister S.B.Dissanayake said.
The Minister who was addressing the media at his Ministry yesterday said that SLFP nomination lists for every electorate for the Local Government(LG) election have already been prepared.
He added that certain former Local Government members, responsible for various acts of misconduct have joined hands with the JO. Such corrupt persons have not been included on the SLFP nomination lists. All of them are with the JO and will contest the Local Government polls under the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna banner he said.
According to Minister Dissanayake, it is only a matter of time before the JO disintergrates and splits into factions before the LG polls.
Besides, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) will also collapse with the announcing of the LG polls. If not the SLPP will experience a bitter result at the LG polls, Minister Dissanayake said.
Asked whether the ban for field officers including Samurdhi officers to contest the LG election will be amended, the Minister said that it is a good move when it comes to safeguarding democracy.
Samurdhi officers have more duties at village level than contesting for elections.
It doesnt matter contesting elections after resigning from the post. Samurdhi officers are duty bound to serve people especially at rural level rather than contesting elections, the Minister noted.
He said that it was Mahinda Rajapaksa who decided to handover the Chairmanship of the SLFP to Maithripala Sirisena.
He took that decision personally. But, now Rajapkasa is making various statements, he said.

South Africa bowling problem for new coach Gibson
JOHANNESBURG: New South Africa coach Ottis Gibson was faced with what he described as a crucial problem at the start of his tenure -- injuries to four leading fast bowlers.
Gibson's first media conference as coach on Tuesday was preceded by team manager Mohammed Moosajee giving an update on the four bowlers -- Vernon Philander, Chris Morris, Dale Steyn and Lungi Ngidi -- who are all out of action a week ahead of the first Test against Bangladesh, starting in Potchefstroom on September 28.
Philander, Morris and Ngidi have back injuries, with Philander hoping to return at franchise level next week with a view to being available for selection for the second Test.
Morris and Ngidi are both in the final stages of rehabilitation and could be considered for some of the limited overs matches towards the end of the Bangladesh tour.
Steyn suffered a muscle strain in the right shoulder which he fractured last November and Moosajee said no time frame was being put on what he said would be a slow, graduated return to full bowling fitness.
Asked about his immediate challenges, former West Indies fast bowler Gibson said: The most crucial for me is four quality fast bowlers being injured. That's a problem straight away.
To win Test matches you need to take 20 wickets and having your best four fast bowlers fit and ready gives you a chance to do that. Gibson said he had asked Cricket South Africa to get all the country's leading players in action during the first round of four-day franchise matches, which started on Tuesday.
I don't want to get into any thinking that Bangladesh is an easy series. He cited Bangladesh's recent win against Australia and said he had been on the receiving end as England's bowling coach when Bangladesh beat England during a shared series last year.
They're going to be tough, said Gibson. That's why I said, let's get everyone playing. We haven't played a lot of cricket since the Tests in England in August and we need to make sure we're up to speed. Gibson acknowledged that winning the World Cup in 2019 was a major goal, following a succession of failures by South Africa in global tournaments.
He said he would discuss with senior players what sort of legacy they wanted to leave.
If it is to win the 2019 World Cup and if everyone gets into that mode, we're climbing a mountain on the way to doing something special. Gibson said he respected the job former coach Russell Domingo had done and said he was happy to be working with Domingo's support staff during the Bangladesh tour.
They have helped take the team to number one. By the end of the Bangladesh series I should be able to say to Cricket South Africa, these are the people I want. Gibson said he had been in frequent touch with South Africa captain Faf du Plessis and he would make it a priority to talk with all South Africa's six franchise coaches to get their input on the quality and character of players in the system.

'Sri Lanka has made tremendous progress': President at UNGA

President Maithripala Sirisena called upon the international community to seriously consider the tremendous progress made by his government towards reconciliation, restoration of democratic freedom, human rights and the rule of law at the 72nd Session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York, yesterday.
The President reiterated that that haste will not yield good results but slow and steady path is the most suitable one to restore religious and communal harmony so that people of all communities could live in peace and harmony as equal citizens.
 President Sirisena was among the few world leaders to address the UN General Assembly on the opening day.
US President Donald Trump also addressed the UN General Assembly.
This was the third time that President Maithripala Sirisena addressed the UN General Assembly after winning Presidential Election held in January 2015.
 President Maithripala Sirisena called upon the international community to extend their fullest support to the slow, but the steady forward march of Sri Lanka to build a progressive, democratic, free and equal society with high morals and discipline considering the tremendous progress made by the government towards reconciliation, restoration of democratic freedoms, human rights and the rule of law.
 Addressing the world leaders in Sinhala, the President said that during the last two and a half years, the government has taken several important steps that are necessary for consolidating democracy, freedom, good governance, and the rule of law.
"Through such transformative steps, we have laid the foundation necessary to forge national reconciliation, and ensure non-recurrence of conflict in our country," he said.
 "As a country that has suffered violent conflict for 30 years, we are drawing from experience and lessons learned to strengthen national reconciliation, and we are determined to prevent the recurrence of conflict. We have given priority in this context to consolidate freedom and democracy in our country, and through a strong foundation of national reconciliation forged through unity and friendship among communities," the President said.
 President Sirisena stressed that the vision of the government is to ensure sustained economic development through the increase of domestic agriculture and industry under environment friendly policies and programs. He emphasized the imperative need to adhere to the Paris Protocol on Climate Change for the sake of the future of the human beings as well as flora and fauna.
 Pointing out that poverty is presented a serious challenge throughout the world, he said that year 2017 has been declared as the year for poverty alleviation in Sri Lanka and have prioritized economic development.
"We have initiated a 'Grama Shakthi' programme to empower villages and to give prominence to putting in place the necessary requirements for addressing all the problems faced by the people of the country.
 President Sirisena called on the world leaders to take a collective action for eradication of narcotic drugs. He said he wanted to draw the attention of the respected General Assembly of the United Nations to the problem of drugs that poses a serious threat to human society itself, preying on young children and causing much destruction to communities.
Such a programme must include plans and efforts to combat this menace at national level in all countries, and at international level, he said.
 The President explained the successful efforts made by the government with regard to lessen the foreign debt burden and usher in economic revival and sought the support of the world community to the efforts made by Sri Lanka for economic development.
Pointing out that Sri Lanka as a member of the UN for the last 62 years adhered to the UN conventions, policies and principles, he said that the nation requires the patient, understanding and support for its slow, but steady march to create a peaceful and prosperous country for its people.
The General Debate was opened with a focus on the theme, Focusing on People: Striving for Peace and a Decent Life for All on a Sustainable Planet.
The 72nd United Nations General Assembly is due to be held at the UN Headquarters in New York until September 23.
 The President is to conclude his six-day official visit on September 23.

## Title: Suicide, never an option!
## Supertitle:

Suicide, never an option!
Sunday, September 10 marked World Suicide Prevention Day 2017. In Sri Lanka, it was observed with many events. The main programme sponsored by Sumithrayo was held at Independence Square to motivate the nation to Take a minute  Change a life. Activities included dramatic presentation, video cuts from survivors, panel discussion by an eminent team and an art competition for youth.
There was also public awareness walk in memory of loved ones and those that struggle every day. In addition, a number of excellent articles appeared in the national newspapers related to this issue.
Suicide has stolen thousands of lives in our country during the last one and half decades. Most of them were young lives. Reasons attributed to suicide and opinions of what to do have been discussed in many forums at great length during those years. Yet, suicide is still continuing to demand a relentless toll. There are thousands of people who are being touched by the tragedy of suicide. When a family loses one of its members as a result of suicide, the traumatic experience will remain in their hearts for many years to come.
High rate
For the last two decades, suicide remained an important issue in the Sri Lankan context. In 1995, Sri Lanka had the highest rate of suicides in the world. Forty seven people out of 100,000 committed suicide that year. A Presidential Task Force was set up to mitigate this dismal statistic and subsequent action helped to reduce the number significantly to 16 per 100,000 by 2014.
However, our suicide rate remains high with an average of 58 persons taking their lives weekly but experts say that the rate would be 15 - 20 times higher if all suicide attempts succeeded. The welcome news is that the rate has been dropping, with around 10 per cent each year during the last few years.
There is a wide variation in the suicide rates within the country. A study investigating variation in suicide rates across Sri Lankas 25 districts revealed that changes in the incidence of suicide would be most marked in rural areas due to the availability of toxic pesticides in these locations. This mode of suicide comes next to strangling.
Another study exposed that the civil disturbances which spanned over 25 years (1983-2009) left the country in social disintegration and suicide rates were highest during that period. A significant reduction was established in post-conflict Sri Lanka. Yet, financial hardship and loss of livelihoods had repeatedly affected families especially in the East and Northern provinces and numerous individuals suffered from depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and many resorted to suicide.
Statistics
If we analyse the Police Records of suicide statistics for 2016, we note that 25 % of the total suicides of the year belong to the youth. (Following the Indian example, we have categorised youth as a person between 16 and 30 years). Fifty five percent of the youth suicides had happened due to three reasons: (1) harassment from family members -19%, (2) disappointment and frustration due out-of-family reasons  28%, (3) Certified mental disorder -7%. All three reasons point up to mental depression.
Youth issues
Some time ago, a national pilot survey was conducted to find out the predominant issues faced by the modern Sri Lankan youth. Among the issues were (1) The belief that their parents were not synchronised with the modern thinking and therefore not supportive to them, (2) They were under too stressful academic and social pressure, (3) They lacked the required life skills to face the calamity of their youth lives, (4) They lacked the vocational or technical skills to secure a decent career and to lead comfortable life in the society. The survey also showed that approximately 10% had seriously considered attempting suicide at least once during their youth period.
This generation of modern youth is changing, becoming increasingly diverse from a socio-cultural perspective. The global evidence shows that prevalence of mental disorders among youth ranges between 10-20%. The situation of Sri Lanka is also similar.
Stresses
Consultant psychiatrist at the Mental Health Institute, Dr. Neil Fernando once said at an interview, Worries about school performance, pressure from parents to achieve academic excellence, economic and other losses affecting the family, bereavement, being accused of wrongdoing by school authorities or law enforcement agents were some of the situations rated as highly stressful by adolescents.
Consultant Community Physician in Family Health Bureau, Dr. Kapila Jayaratne commented, Youths experiencing multiple and ongoing stresses of this nature should be considered as having a potential for suicide. Teenagers and young adults are impressionable and sensitive, and especially vulnerable to social and peer pressure.
According to Dr. Jayaratne, social and peer pressure are the most common causes for teenager suicide. They are going through dramatic biological and psychological changes and it can be a very difficult time for them. Teenagers are often extra-defensive or aggressive, and quick to react. Adults and teachers should understand this.
Mental depression
Many studies have revealed that most of those who die by suicide have a mental depression. Most young people commit suicide because of their depression due to difficulty of tolerating distress associated with an interpersonal conflict. Therefore, rapid interventions addressing central causes of suicidal behaviour are essential.
In Sri Lanka, the high rate of suicide among young adults is also associated with greater socio-economic stressors that have followed the rapidly changing market economy and huge disparities in incomes and the inability to meet role obligations in the new socially changed environment. Research has proven that prolonged unemployment has always been a huge burden to the youth is also a considerable suicide factor. Education system in Sri Lanka is highly competitive and is overly academic orientated. In the recent tines, some efforts have been made to modernize the programme by introducing apprenticeships and certain career opportunities. Yet, significant portion of youth remains unemployed.
In addition to the education problem, the breakdown of the joint family system and the desire to prove ones self-worthiness has proven to be detrimental on the mental health of the youth. Therefore, psycho-social support and services focusing these matters are essential in tackling youth suicide rates.
Rapid urbanization, industrialization and changing family systems are resulting in social upheaval and distress. The diminishing traditional support systems leave people vulnerable to suicidal behaviour. Hence, there is an emerging need for external emotional support.
It is obvious that the state-sponsored psychiatric modalities and facilities are insufficient to meet the increasing suicidal challenges. Rehabilitation activities still need to be developed and spread island-wide.
The enormity of the problem combined with the inadequate state mental health service has led to the emergence of a number of NGOs in the field of suicide prevention. With the support of these NGOs, the Government should attempt to improve the community-based services throughout the country to address this issue.
Training
Years ago, mental health patients had to come to the hospital to get treatment. Modern thinking is that health professionals should go to them. When they do so, in addition to treating to the disease, the professionals should be able to help patients change other environmental factors that contribute to the illness as well.
The primary aim of these NGOs should be to provide support to suicidal individuals by befriending them. Often, they function as an entry point for those needing professional services. Of course, they are doing a great service.
Apart from obtaining services from NGOs, the Government should also undertake education of gatekeepers, raising awareness in the public and media and some intervention programmes.
Gatekeeper-training programmes (GKTs) are an increasingly popular approach in western countries to addressing access to mental health care in adolescent and youth population. GKTs target individuals (gatekeepers) who are in frequent contact with others in their communities. The trainings equip non-professionals with the skills and knowledge to recognize, intervene with, and link distressed individuals to appropriate mental health resources.

Tanks in Addalaichenai under renovation
Renovating the Karadikulam and Padarakal tanks in the Addalaichenai DS division is nearing completion, Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.
The renovation is carried out by the Addalaichenai Irrigation Unit in the Akkaraipattu Irrigation region under the Climate Resilience Improvement Project, he said.
The Karadikulam tank was damaged in the Tsunami 2002 and Rs.10 million were spent to renovate the tank, Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.
All projects will be complete before the Maha season, he said.
Farmers of Karadikulam West Kandam and Karadikulam East Kandam in the Akkaraipattu Regional Engineers division will receive the benefit of the new projects, he said. Akaraipattu farmers have undergone severe difficulties and no action was taken to address their issues in the past.
They thank the government officials for carrying out development works in their regions to address the issues.
About 750 acres of paddy lands would be cultivated during the Yala and Maha seasons via the new tanks. Irrigation Engineer T. Mayooran said.

Trump tells UNGA: UN has not met full potential
UN: US President Donald Trump made his debut at the United Nations on Monday, using his first moments at the world body to urge the 193-nation organization to reduce bureaucracy and costs while more clearly defining its mission around the world.
But while Trump chastised the United Nations - an organization he sharply criticized as a candidate for President for its spiraling costs - he said the United States would pledge to be partners in your work in order to make the UN a more effective force for peace across the globe.
In recent years, the United Nations has not reached its full potential due to bureaucracy and mismanagement, said Trump, who rebuked the United Nations for a ballooning budget. We are not seeing the results in line with this investment.
The President pushed the UN to focus more on people and less on bureaucracy and to change business as usual and not be beholden to ways of the past which were not working while also suggesting that the United States was paying more than its fair share to keep the New York-based world body operational.
But he also complimented the steps the United Nations had taken in the early stages of the reform process and made no threats to withdraw his nations support.
His measured tone stood in stark contrast to his last maiden appearance at a global body, when he stood at NATOs new Brussels headquarters in May and scolded the member nations for not paying enough and refusing to explicitly back its mutual defense pact.
While running for office, Trump labeled the UN as weak and incompetent, and not a friend of either the United States or Israel. But he has softened his tone since taking office, telling ambassadors from UN Security Council member countries at a White House meeting this year that the UN has tremendous potential.
Trump more recently has praised a pair of unanimous council votes to tighten sanctions on North Korea over its continued nuclear weapon and ballistic missile tests.
Trumps big moment comes Tuesday, when he delivers his first address to a session of the UN General Assembly. The annual gathering of world leaders will open amid serious concerns about Trumps priorities, including his policy of America First, his support for the UN and a series of global crises. It will be the first time world leaders will be in the same room and able to take the measure of Trump. The President on Monday praised UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who also spoke at the reform meeting and said he shared Trumps vision for a less wasteful UN to live up to its full potential. The US has asked member nations to sign a declaration on UN reforms, and more than 120 have done so. The president also kicked off his maiden speech at the world body by making a reference to the Trump-branded apartment tower across First Ave. from the U.N.
Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said Trumps criticisms were accurate at the time, but that it is now a new day at the UN An organization that talked a lot but didnt have a lot of action has given way to a United Nations thats action-oriented, she said, noting the Security Council votes on North Korea this month.
Guterres has proposed a massive package of changes, and Haley said the UN is totally moving toward reform.
The United States is the largest contributor to the UN budget, reflecting its position as the worlds largest economy. It pays 25 percent of the UNs regular operating budget and over 28 percent of the separate peacekeeping budget - a level of spending that Trump has complained is unfair. The Trump administration is conducting a review of the UNs 16 far-flung peacekeeping operations, which cost nearly $8 billion a year. Cutting their costs and making them more effective is a top priority for Haley. - CNN

Tyson Fury urges UK Anti-Doping for resolution
London: Britains troubled former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury challenged the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) body to either hurry up and ban him for taking an illegal substance or clear him to resume his turbulent career.
The 29-year-old, who has not fought since his shock defeat of Wladimir Klitschko to win the WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight titles in November 2015, is waiting to appear in front of a UKAD hearing after being charged with a doping offence over a year ago.
UKAD postponed the original hearing in May -- because of a potential conflict of interest involving a member of the panel -- and have yet to announce when it will be held.
How long must I be held up and kept out of action tweeted Fury on Monday.
Its been 15 months since Ive been under investigation, youre keeping an innocent man from fulfilling his destiny and from providing for his family. UKAD refused to comment on Furys case, adding there is no timescale for its investigation.
Fury, whose cousin Hughie takes on WBO heavyweight world champion Joseph Parker in Manchester this Saturday, said UKAD were denying him his human rights.
Everybody else is dealt with in a few months, why must I be treated any differently he tweeted.
Surely there must be a human rights law preventing this from happening to people!
Either ban me or set me free as Ive been in limbo for a long time! I want to move on with my life!
Clear my name and let me return to my former glory.
Fury, who admitted last October to taking cocaine to alleviate depression, was told by the British Boxing Board of Control in May his licence was suspended pending further investigation by UKAD into anti-doping and medical issues. Fury beat Klitschko on points in a world title fight in November 2015 and once held both the International Boxing Federation (IBF) and World Boxing Association (WBA) belts now held by compatriot Anthony Joshua.
But mental health problems forced him to relinquish his titles, while his licence to box was subsequently suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control. AFP

Uber Integrates Emergency Helpline Number In-app
Uber, the world's largest on-demand ride sharing company, today announced the integration of emergency helpline numbers in the rider app. Reinforcing its commitment to enhance safety of its riders, the integration aims to help riders in need for urgent help during a trip. From the police emergency hotline, to the accident service and tourist police, help is just a tap away.
Commenting on this development, Arjun Srinivasan, General Manager, Uber Sri Lanka, said, Safety of our riders is a priority for us at Uber and our technology opens up immense opportunities to make rides as safe as possible. Ubers integration of the emergency number is one such step that highlights our absolute commitment to the safety of our riders - before, during and after every ride.
In the event of an emergency situation during a trip, riders in an Uber can now access an in-app card to connect with relevant national toll free help desk in Sri Lanka. Once pressed, the rider will be prompted with the phone dialer. Calling 119 will connect the rider to the police emergency hotline, 110 for ambulance ,fire and rescue, 0112 691 111 for accident service and 0112 421 052 for tourist police.
The introduction of this feature adds to the existing in-built repertoire of safety features in the Uber app. Technologies like Uber provide an incredible opportunity to improve safety of riders and drivers in new and innovative ways before, during and after every ride.
To ensure a relatively safe, reliable and convenient travel from point A to point B, the Uber app gives you the ability to see your drivers details in advance, including his name, photograph, make of car and the car registration number.
While on trip, riders can avail the benefit of GPS tracking and by using the share my status option, share their trip details with as many contacts on their phonebook as they want. This allows for the people receiving the message to immediately track the route and location of the vehicle at any point in time during the trip. In the event of an emergency situation, riders can now access the Police emergency helpline 119 through the app. Apart from rating the driver once the trip is complete, riders can go to the Past Trips section in-app and provide feedback on the ride. Our round-the-clock in-app customer support is designed to further improve product and operations, with a core focus to provide specialised support for critical incidents that require immediate attention.

Unemployed graduates gatecrash NCP Council chamber
An attempt made by a group of nearly 400 unemployed graduates to gatecrash into the chamber of the North Central Provincial Council while a council meeting was in progress yesterday morning, was thwarted by the security officers who took timely action to close the gates of the main building and lock it up.
As the graduates continued their protest demanding job placements before the councils official term ended on October 2, the police had to be called in to maintain peace.
The protesters, who jeered at council members belonging to all parties, demanded that they be given postings before the council term ended.
The President of the Unemployed Graduates Association Asanka Rupasinghe who led the demonstrators, said an examination was held in March this year for the recruitment of graduate and diploma qualified teachers, and graduate development officers followed by interviews in July.
Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne, thereafter, promised to give placements before August 31. The pledge was to recruit 1,800 unemployed graduates as teachers and development officers. They were still languishing without jobs while some of their members had even married and become parents.
The Chief Minister, thereafter, agreed for a meeting with representatives of the demonstrating graduates and agreed to give appointments after a pending Court case filed by UNP member Kasthuri Anuradhanayake was settled. Thereafter, the graduates called off their protest and left the council premises.

Violin interlude
Violin has become a part and partial of Carnatic instrumental music arena. It generally accompanies the vocal and instrumental music. It is considered that Violin was the first alien instrument from West, which penetrated the Indian musical system, and gained the social and cultural recognition, especially in the traditional South Indian Carnatic music world.
The entry of Violin in the Carnatic music traces back to over hundred and fifty years. According to the earlier history of Carnatic Violin states that one of the ministers of Marthi regime of Thanjavur, named Varahapayya was the very first person who was attracted by this very sharp and high tonal quality Western string instrument. He, first of all, heard the melodious music of the violin at a European band of East India Company. Minister Varahapayya, before trying to introduce this instrument in the Carnatic music, tried his best to explore all the possibilities in using this instrument for the Carnatic music.
This four-stringed instrument is played with a bow and with fingers.
Alien string
From the 16th century onwards gradually the alien influence started penetrating into the Indian musical system slowly but in a limited manner. It is said that Baluswamy Dikshitar 1786-1859, one of the brothers of the great Carnatic musicians undertook training in Western Violin and tried to adopt this alien string instrument into Carnatic music with its own identity.
While using this Western musical instrument in Carnatic music, it totally avoids all the Western musical influences. For instance when Violin is used for Carnatic music by tuning the instrument, playing posture position, adopting techniques are entirely different from the usage of Western Violin. The player of Carnatic Violin sits down on the platform and plays. The player holds the Violin in between his right heel and his chest. The left-hand fingers are freely allowed to move, while the right-hand plays the bow.
Vadivelu of Tanjore Quartette, a Carnatic music stalwart, boldly adopted violin for Carnatic music as well as Tamil classical dance. Vadivelu was the eminent court musician of the famed Swathi Thirunal Maharaja. With the passage of time, many Carnatic Violinists emerged into the Carnatic music world.
This string instrument is more or less considered as an easy and adjustable instrument to any type of human voice. The melody of Violin instrument is beautifully blended to a different pitch and a different quality of human voice. Among the strings the fourth string is much more suitable for the human voice, this particular steel string has a high tonal and excellent expressive quality. Violin in the Carnatic music arena beautifully and expressively expresses the Gamagas and the nuances of Ragas in a clear and exceptional manner.
Dance concerts
Today Violin in Indian music is used as a separate solo musical instrument as well as an accompanying musical instrument for vocal, instrumental and dance performances. In dance sometimes during the performances, musical interludes are adopted to reveal certain emotions. Especially in dance, the violin music is used to reveal the emotions like sorrow and sadness. Even sometimes it is used to play the opening bars of the song in the music and the dance concerts.
Playing Violin is an exceptional and remarkable talent. It sweeps from one sting to another smoothly. The use of Violin in Indian music could be divided into two different categories. One is for the Hindustani Music violin and the other is for the Carnatic music Violin. The purpose of using Violin in Carnatic music as well as in Hindustani music is the same, yet the trend and tendency of the musical factors of two varieties are different from one another.
Still, Indian Violin has its origin from the Western Violin, yet there are some Western scholars who obviously felt that the Indian Violin has had its origin from some of the ancient traditional native ancestral Indian string instruments. Especially from the oldest Indian string instrument and the folk musical instrument known as Ravanastram. This folk instrument Ravanastram is still in use in certain Indian states like Rajasthan and Gujarat.

WFE CEO lauds CSEs efforts to develop regional capital market
Making her first visit to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), the Chief Executive Officer of the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) Nandini Sukumar commended the special relationship between the two organizations and stressed on the important contribution made by the CSE to regional capital market development.
Her visit aims to further strengthen the relationship between CSE and WFE and will also offer the Federations insight on strategic initiatives pursued by the CSE.
Speaking at a Market Opening Ceremony organized to honour her visit, she said, I see the CSE and its engagement with the WFE as a metaphor for the success of WFE. When I see the exchange participating with the WFE more and more, I feel that we are doing the right things and that we are on the right track when serving our members. Youve been a part of our history and you are a part of our future.
She added that CSE has been an incredibly dynamic exchange and supportive of other exchanges in the region.
In countries such as Sri Lanka, exchanges are particularly important, Sukumar said. An exchange at the heart of the market like it is here, has a far wider more systemic and more profound role that visibly translates into growth and development. We see first-hand what a difference we can make in daily life and through our working lives. 
CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardena speaking at the event welcomed Sukumar and thanked the WFE for opportunities and assistance provided to the CSE over the years. He also congratulated Sukumar on a successful WFE General Assembly and Annual Meeting hosted in Bangkok, Thailand, earlier this month.
He noted that the WFE has been instrumental in offering the CSE a pathway to engage, collaborate and learn from other markets and more developed peers.
Established in 1961 and headquartered in London, WFE is the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses and represents over 200 market infrastructure providers. The CSE obtained WFE membership in 1998 and was its first South Asian member.
WFE exchanges are home to nearly 45,000 listed companies and the market capitalisation of these entities is over US$67.9 trillion; furthermore, around US$84.18 trillion (EOB) in trading annually passes through the infrastructures WFE members safeguard (at end 2016).
WFE is the definitive source for exchange-traded statistics and publishes over 350 market data indicators. Its statistics database stretches back more than 40 years and provides information and insight into developments on global exchanges.

zMessenger, SSD-Tech partnership to pave way for concrete initiatives in mobile arena
zMessenger, the countrys largest mobile marketing solutions provider and winner of multiple awards recently embarked on a partnership with SSD-Tech, a leading technology company based in Bangladesh. The agreement would emphasize zMessengers regional expansion with regards to leveraging on the potential market opportunities in Bangladesh.
A partnership agreement was recently signed between the two organizations with the aim of conducting mutual knowledge exchange. SSD Tech Chairman, CEO Matin Mahbubul was in the country to confirm the agreement along with zMessenger Co-Founder, CEO, Jayomi Lokuliyana. Below are excerpts from an interview conducted.
Q: Can you explain to us how this agreement came to be finalized with SSD-Tech in Bangladesh
Jayomi  First of all I would like to thank the officials from SSD-Tech who came down to acknowledge this partnership with us. We conducted an analysis of current influential tech organizations in Bangladesh and SSD-Tech of course, was placed on top. SSD-Tech have been considered as veterans and strong players in the Bangladeshi market and also acquire a strong product portfolio. We recognized strong innovative synergies that can be leveraged in the process and so we approached them and conducted discussions to validate this relationship.
We decided to expand our services with Bangladesh due to the proximity region-wise and of course, considering the growth that is evident today in Asia, we felt that Bangladesh was a good place to commence our expansion with. zMessenger has envisioned expansion growth this year and this happens to be our second partnership, with Japan being our first. Many companies tend to look to the West for such expansions but we need to realize that such opportunities are also closer to home.
Q: Can you disclose SSD-Techs initial outlook towards engaging with zMessenger and Sri Lanka in general
Mahbubul  SSD-Tech is a $65 million Company that has been around for over a decade. We are a Bangladesh-based multinational technology company, SSD-Tech. We have always considered working with Sri Lanka and conducting mutual services exchange and after having found zMessenger as being an ideal local partner. Both companies had been instigated around the same time period in this industry. We had considered Sri Lanka for a while now and we believe that this partnership has been a timely initiative.
In the process we found many pieces of intellectual properties which can be mutually exchanged amongst each other. We also found that zMessenger acquires a number of outstanding products that would prove influential to the Bangladesh market. We also look forward to expand our footprint in Sri Lanka as well through a win-win situation.
Q: In what way will both organizations come forth with relevant implementation in the field
Jayomi  zMessenger acquires capabilities that will increase our digital marketing asset base as a result of this partnership. We are strongly into digital marketing and value added services with 14 years experience in this field.
We have products that fall under categories such as education an entertainment and look forward to launch these in the near future. Considering that Bangladesh is a country that is eight times bigger than Sri Lanka, we anticipate learning curves along the way and a great platform for zMessenger to delve into.
With our array of value added services, we need to bring these elements into the markets.
Mahbubul -We are glad to have partnered with Sri Lanka and I believe that Bangladesh can relate with this country in many ways.
We have cultural similarities as well and this also helps to form a conducive environment for business relations. SSD-Tech is already present in Myanmar, Malaysia and Singapore. Sri Lanka is an exciting market with immense potential in the traditional mobile arena and we believe our alliance will help bring about an innovative and positive impact to the telecom market for both countries thorough the introduction of concrete initiatives in the mobile arena.
