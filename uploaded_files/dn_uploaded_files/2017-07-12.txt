Ancient Greek in simple parlance
Criteria for evaluating literature have been of controversy throughout the years ever since it was first established and had become a popular necessity.
The numerous ideas pertaining to evaluation has been subject to change before the actual ideas took their form as 'criteria'. The 'criteria' mainly depended on the changing values of the social context they were exercising. On the other hand, literature had been considerably established before its reception and appreciation.
Then came to be the relationship between the creative artist and the recipient being guided by a third party. It is then literature ceased to be just 'good' or 'bad' mostly depending on its appeal.
Distant past
Greek literary theory has served as a foundation on which Western literary criticism had been built. The impact had been such it reverberates in the East of the modern day as well. Often people hark back to the critics of the distant past; quoting them even to the point of misinterpreting them. Refuting also weighs equally to appreciating as well as approving as it signifies its impact on thought.
The reason to compile this volume in simple English with quotations to substantiate facts and arguments is to encourage readers to read further on the subject.
Professor Kamani Jayasekara has provided a brief introduction to the origin of literary criticism in Greece and concentrated on Aristophanes and Plato. The criticisms, one may observe are value based which again could be interpreted as the criteria of assessment for the individual involved.
Modern context
As a creative writer Professor Jayasekara entertains grave concerns regarding how and to what extent critics operate in the modern context. For her, it is somewhat difficult to comprehend how and why the creative has to be monitored within imposed limits or methodologies. Then comes the personal; the extent to which a person's private affiliations have an impact on the evaluation of another. Thereafter the consciousness of the responsibility of such a medium and their integrity.
The facts collected are mostly based on Professor Jayasekaras doctoral thesis  'Social Conscience and Social consciousness of Greek' Dramatists of the Classical Period of Ancient Greece.

Arms laid down
July 7, 2017, was a historical day for the world and Sri Lanka. At the UN in New York, 122 nations voted and this included Sri Lanka, adopting the first ever Nuclear Ban Treaty (NBT). We are fortunate to see that finally, the world has realised the need to ban the nuclear bomb after seeing the devastating impact in Hiroshima and Nagasaki on humanity and nature even after 70 years. The nuclear bombs were used to attack Hiroshima and Nagasaki instantly killing hundreds of thousands of humans and causing severe damage to the natural environment. In the aftermath, many generations suffered due to the impact of radiation and some are still suffering from it.
After seeing the devastation that occurred in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, in 1945, various global initiatives on nuclear weapons such as Conventions came into effect for banning the testing, non-proliferation and not losing it to terrorist groups.
Conventions were created such as the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water (1963), the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water (1963), the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1996), the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968) and the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism (2005).
But none of above conventions was for the ban of nuclear weapons or worked towards eliminating them from the earth. The world has witnessed that up until now the States and Non-States Parties to the above nuclear-related conventions have been accumulating and testing various types of modern advanced nuclear weapons.
Such weapons are a thousand times in advance of the previous nuclear bombs which were used for attacking Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US. If a nuclear war took place in the present day, one will be unable to assess the level of damage it will cause to humans and nature due to its nondiscriminatory nature and plethora of power the current nuclear weapons possess now.
International peace
The growing influence of civil society on international peace around the world was witnessed in the last few decades taking the leadership to ban such weapons.
In the recent history, they campaigned to ban certain nondiscriminatory weapons and supported the regulating of conventional weapons at the UN. Due to successful campaigns led by civil society, it was able to give leadership to ban Anti-Personnel Landmines through the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban Convention - APMBC (1997) and Cluster Bombs through the Convention on Cluster Munitions  CCM (2008) and regulating of conventional weapons through the Arms Trade Treaty  ATT (2013).
In addition to this the first human rights convention the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities  UNCRPD (2007), came to the world mainly due fact that APMBC had inspired further efforts at the international level to protect and promote the rights of persons with disabilities.
Civil society played a key role in the UNCRPD negotiations.
The APMBC, CCM, ATT and CRPD are the most successful Conventions today at the UN, mainly due to the fact that the governments, UN agencies and civil societies are closely working together to achieve the objectives of the Conventions. Most recently, civil society successfully led the campaign to ban nuclear weapons and engaged in negotiations with governments and UN agencies and was able to give birth successfully to the Nuclear Ban Treaty - NBT (2017) this month with 122 countries voting for it.
This legally binding instrument, prohibiting nuclear weapons, marks a turning point for nuclear weapons in the future.
Even though Sri Lanka is not a nuclear power, the country has been in the forefront for nuclear and other disarmament efforts. Sri Lanka has been a signatory to the above-mentioned nuclear-related and other Conventions. Sri Lanka took the lead from the inception when negotiations and active engagement with such Conventions throughout.
At one time Sri Lanka was called the Champion of Disarmament which got positive global attention for the country, and at that time it was the brand name for Sri Lanka among the international disarmament community.
Non-aligned foreign policy
Sri Lanka always acted as a neutral nation, following non-aligned foreign policy to achieve this success. This has not badly impacted on the relations with neighbouring nuclear powers India, Pakistan and also with the USA, Russia and China. These countries are not the states parties to the above nuclear related and some of the other Conventions. But Sri Lanka never followed them and stood up as a strong sovereign state in the region.
From 2005 onwards, Sri Lanka did not accede to any disarmament Convention claiming that the country was engaged in protracted armed conflict with the LTTE until 2009. Several countries during war time have acceded to the above Conventions to gain benefits and this includes support of world peace initiatives. Even after the war, Sri Lanka did not accede to any disarmament Conventions but the previous government had agreed to accede to humanitarian disarmament conventions like the APMBC and CCM. But they were not able to accede to any disarmament Conventions and were not engaged with the UN and the international community taking some stance.
With the change of government in January 2015, there is renewed hope for Sri Lanka that the country will accede to the above Conventions.
The Sri Lanka Campaign to Ban Landmines (SLCBL) met President Maithripala Sirisena in December 2015 and explained to him about the importance of Sri Lankas accession to the APMBC and CCM and ratification of the CRPD and also presented him with related publications. In 2016 February Sri Lanka ratified the CRPD and on March same year the Cabinet of Ministers took a decision to support Sri Lankas accession to the APMBC. Both actions were well received by the local and international community but Sri Lanka has yet to accede to the APMBC.
Sri Lanka voted for the NBT on July 7, breaking more than a decade of closed-door policies to the world of disarmament. If Sri Lanka accedes to the APMBC and CCM with other Conventions in September this year, Sri Lankas President Maithirpala Sirisena will be the first head of state in the world to deposit more than three Conventions (NBT, APMBC and CCM) ratification instruments at the UN Secretary Generals office during the UN General Assembly Meeting in New York.
Apart from the various other benefits, this will make a pathway for Sri Lanka to become a Soft power in the region as well as bring back the old glory of being a Champion of Disarmament. This golden opportunity will not occur in the foreseeable future for any other leader or country and Sri Lanka should not miss this opportunity.

Army to become capacity-based
The newly-appointed Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, in his maiden formal address on Monday called upon all to assist him to transform the Army to be a capacity-based organization rather than a threat-based one, by raising the professional standards of the soldier in every sphere.
He was addressing a representative gathering of Senior Officers and Officers at the Army Headquarters after his assumption of new office.
The formal address of the new Commander, considered to be one of the most assertive and straightforward ones in recent times, underscored the need to be always a gentleman.
Everyone can be an Officer but cannot be a gentleman of required quality. Gentlemanliness is therefore much more admired and your example is more significant rather than your perception. I always welcome constructive and fair criticism with positive attitudes and like to be a patient listener all the time. In this new era, we must be able to take challenges and reach our targets with dedication and commitment, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake said.
Thanking the President, Prime Minister and the former Defence Secretary for keeping confidence in him, the Commander paid a glowing tribute to all 21 of his predecessors who elevated the organization to the dizzy heights of invaluable service, in which he has been serving for more than 36 years.
Late General Denis Perera, being my first Commander and all past Commanders, including my immediate predecessor, General Crisanthe de Silva, deserve my praise and gratitude because it was their dedication which enabled me to stand here, today as the 22nd Commander. I also owe a deep gratitude to the people who prayed and cried for me, he remarked.
Competition has to be there in the Army too, like in any other organization, the second oldest profession in the world. This is the truth, but it should be a fair, decent and a gentlemanly competition, through which anyone can reach the apex of office as the Commander, the Commander noted.
Speaking out his mind about how the future would hold for the organization, the Commander underlined the importance of transforming the Army to be a capacity-based one instead of a threat-based one as full-fledged professionals in disaster management, nation-building, reconciliation and all other spheres of national responsibility and concern, certainly with the military prowess to fight against a conventional or an unconventional urban fighting, insurgency, etc.
A soldier must be able to adjust to face any challenge of uncertainty and eventuality under any circumstances. You need to focus on the area of his interest, area of influence and area of responsibility, if we are to groom him as a skillful one, the Commander pointed out.
Ours has to be mission command- oriented assignment, and I am always prepared to perform my part and I expect the same from you, but ensure you do your part within the parameters of your responsibilities. I am not going to do your job and I trust you. I will only be steering the organization. You would have come here onboard different ships, but we all are now in the same boat. I will steer it as the Army wants. If we fail to sail together, we are bound to fall, he cautioned.
When it comes to malpractices, misuses and wrongdoing, I maintain, justice should equally be meted out to the rank of a General down to a Private. Discipline is the strength of our organization, and I need that be kept in mind all the time by everyone. Training was one of the best welfare for me and that should be the case with any soldier in a capacity-based Army. We are on our way to establish a National Defence University for ourselves, intending to produce more learned Officers. Similarly, qualitative standards of the Senior Command, Officer Cadet, down to the Recruit training level would be raised with introduction of new modules, he said.
Talking about the structural reforms that may be introduced to the Army, the new Commander remarked that the proposed move is not to downsize the Army, but to right size the Army to get the best results.
We have our own expertise within the organization for such forthcoming reforms since we had the skills to make war-winning strategies, tactics, small group operations, etc and apply them by ourselves. Such moves are always open to negotiations and discussions. Having fought a bitter war for so many years and admired as the worlds best Army, we ourselves are able to manage things and no outside assistance is needed for that. Such structural changes for the organization would be introduced for the betterment of the Army administration and other logistics. I am always prepared to take up any challenge in my life, the Commander opined.
Without compromising the national security concerns, we need to change our attitudes and mentality since the war is over now and we are now in post-conflict era. Before somebody directs us to do changes, we have to produce our own suggestions and take necessary action. I need to use two different criteria for the Officers and Other Ranks who served the Army before the year 2009 and afterwards. Its a fair way to care for them, the Commander commented.
In his view, the Commander said that 1/3 of the Army should always have Combat Readiness, another 1/3 for nation-building and the remaining 1/3 for administration of the Army and it is high time for us to re-build and promote the image of the organization.
I would also suggest the appointment of a special committee for preparation of image-building measures. I also feel that soldiers must get priority over Officers because Officers could always manage easily.
Remember that we are going to fight a Corporals War in future and not that of the Generals, the Commander added.He also requested Colonels of Regiments to inculcate their treasured values to respective Regiments and arrange programmes, accordingly.

Battle-hardened
Passion for what he does and compassion for his fellow students are his defining attributes. Perfect Prefects talks to Trinity College Senior Prefect Rishane Madena who has learnt mental strength on the field of gladiators.
I have been in the 1st XV Rugby team for three years now. I was also the captain of the Under 16 Rugby team. Since my younger days, I have had that leadership quality in me. My coach Lote Raikabula, a New Zealander, told us that he is not here to teach us Rugby but to make us gentlemen. During this one year I have learnt a lot through sports, more than what I have learnt in two or three years at school. He instilled a lot of cultures, a lot of tradition and a lot of qualities in our Rugby players. Mostly it was mental strength we learnt. And that was not only on the field.
Coach Lote taught us that if you are going through something bad, then you go into a dark place in your mental side. What he said was  enjoy that dark place. Dont be reluctant to do anything in that dark place, because the day you become reluctant is the day you will fall apart. So enjoy the dark place and take it as a challenge. Every time I do something that is what I think of. Any problem that arises in school, I do not take it as a problem. I take it as a challenge, explained Madena.
Trusted role
As a player on the field of Rugby, you play against another 15 men.
As a team, we are a family. That is a culture that has been inculcated in us. I trust my teammates. We know our duties and roles. I can trust all 14 members to do their roles. According to that if I do not do my role it will fall apart. I focus on my role, and I see someone going off track, I will advise them, said Madena.
Rugger players are like gladiators in battle.
This sport we play is not easy. People compare Rugby to American Football and say that American Football is more dangerous. But in American Football, 80 percent of their bodies are covered in guards. This is not the case with Rugby players. In that sense, I would call us Gladiators. I am passionate about playing Rugby and even though I had suffered injuries -concussed and sustained gashes, had stitches and dislocated my shoulder, I strap myself and take some pain killers, pointed out Madena.
Madenas message to anyone who wants to become a leader is to stand for yourself.
Be able to speak for yourself and be straightforward in what you say. People tend to use leaders as their own puppets. If you stand for yourself and if you are straightforward in what you say and you are confident and you stand by what you say, I think that is the best quality a leader could have, stated Madena
Madenas father was senior prefect in 1987 and his eldest brother was senior prefect in 2012.
I get a lot of advice from them. They support me in a vast way. My mother also advises me. Any leader should be humble. He needs to adapt to all the situations. Being a Senior Prefect/Head Prefect, you have to be able to converse with all the students. Me, being the leader of the student body I should be able to converse with students, staff members as well as the administration. You have to have the ability to adapt to your situation and be able to converse with people in a way that it is appropriate. You need to be dedicated and committed to what you are doing by being the leader of over 3000 students. So we see to the welfare of the students as well, added Madena.
Community feeling
Madena believes that proper values inculcated in the student will benefit the generations to come and that Trinity is a school that respects all four religions.
When I look at the world I used to have a problem with racism. You still see people judging other people according to their religion. Being in a school where all four religions are respected, Trinity is a family and community and we do not have any grudges against any religion or race. If we can inculcate these values in our school, so can every other school. Then it will be good for the society in the future. And this will have a vast impact on generations to come, informed Madena.
One big duty for him is to maintain the discipline of the school and see to the welfare of the students.
As a Senior Prefect, some of the duties and responsibilities are looking to the welfare of all the 3,300 students. We as students, know all about the shortcomings of the school from our point of view. More than the administration or the staff realise it, we know how the students think. I and the prefect body being around school we see all the shortcomings and so we inform the administration. I personally am in the Principals office a lot talking everything about Trinity, pointed out Madena
Unlike other schools the senior prefect-ship is the term during our A/Ls. For example, in Royal, they start after their A/Ls. Our term starts in February to the next February. So that is during our A/Ls. So it is really tough balancing sports, studies and the Head Prefect-ship as well.
So yes it is a stressful situation so all of this is in my mind. But then again I love everything I do. I love to study. I have 16 other prefects in my Senior Prefect Body. They help me a lot and I delegate the work amongst them. I oversee everything. With their help, I am able to balance everything. They are a variety of students who are sportsmen and studious people. It is easy to delegate the work because of the talent at my disposal. In addition to the 16 Prefects and Madena there are 60 other school officers, said Madena
At the beginning of this year, his ambition was to be a pilot.
I have spoken to my parents and teachers and my counsellor, they all made me realise that Management and Tourism are the way to go for me. At the moment I am still focusing on my A/Ls and sports at the moment and the Head Prefect-ship as well. So after my A/Ls I will select the path good for me, stated Madena.

BIA extension has not allocated space for logistics services- SLFFA
Fizel Jabir
The newly proposed extension of BIA has not allocated space for logistics services, even though significant growth is seen in tran-shipments handled through BIA, alleged Sri Lanka Logistics & Freight Forwarders Association (SLFFA) Immediate Past Chairperson Tania Polonnowita Wettimuny addressing the 36th AGM in Colombo recently.
We would like to urge the chairman and the board of Airport and Aviation Services Sri Lanka (AASL) to look at our request of both improvement of the existing air cargo village facility to global standards and allocation of possible area for logistics in your proposed expansion, she requested.
The shortage of equipment and machinery and labor issues from time to time has created delays, double handling, damages, losses with no compensation.
Particularly in the less-than-container-load cargo and multi-country consolidation cargo all resulting in higher than acceptable costs to clear out LCL and MCC cargo, which in turn has impacted our customers daily operations, she alleged.
It is also disappointing to note the current status of our warehouse facilities within the port premises. While the countrys vision is to promote the hub concept, very little initiatives and emphasis have gone into infrastructure development related to improvement of warehousing, CFS facilities to cater to our customers locally and overseas.
We call on you to actively support the participation of our neutral industry body SLFFA cargo services initiatives and investment to provide services so urgently needed for LCL and MCC cargo within the port without considering it a threat or competition to the SLPA as this can potentially be a win-win solution for all parties, she said.
Referring to the governments infrastructure development in ports, she said they were very excited to note the initiatives and efforts taken by the Government to activate the Hambantota Port.
We are closely watching the initiatives being been taken by the government to restructure Sri Lankan Airlines and its associated activities such as ground handling.
SLFFA has always advocated the need for a strong and efficient national carrier and level playing field and to this extent we welcome these initiatives so long as there is full transparency in the whole process.
In this context, we urge the authorities not to permit the operation of centralized cargo agents settlement system (CASS) in Sri Lanka as this is ill-conceived for local market conditions and will ultimately have a serious financial cash flow impact on small and medium scale exporters, particularly those exporters of fruits, vegetables, ornamental fish and other live fish products and indeed on all of the perishable exports.
She said they would also like to see SriLankan using its role as sole ground handler to fast track the process of e-awb, e-booking initiatives which SLFFA cargo services have invested significantly for last four years within SriLanka in conjunction with CCN.
She pointed out that e-trading initiative if fast-tracked can potentially save the industry million of rupees by way of eradication of duplicated paper trail and physical interface.
Further during the year under review, SLFFA made submissions to the Ministry of Finance requesting to allow the corporate tax component of freight forwarders to remain at the lower rate of 14%, which was accepted and incorporated into the 2017 budget proposals. This new tax will applicable from financial year 2017/2018.

Bottom-trawling to attract two-year prison term, fine
Sri Lankas legislative amendment to prohibit bottom-trawling, a destructive fishing practice, is a welcome move, despite its likely near-term consequence of deepening the fisheries conflict in the Palk Bay region. Bottom trawling in the island nations territorial waters will now attract a possible two-year prison term and a fine of Rs. 50,000.
The practice, which involves trawlers dragging weighted nets along the sea floor, is known to cause great depletion of fishery resources, and curbing it is in the interest of sustainable fishing.
The initial reaction from Tamil Nadu has been one of concern and consternation. Political parties claim the amendment is draconian, and that it is targeted at the States fishermen who regularly use hundreds of trawlers in Sri Lankan territorial waters. This criticism is way off the mark.
In recent years, some fishermen in northern Sri Lanka have also adopted bottom trawling. If this practice continues to gain ground even among local fishermen, the long-term consequences on fishing resources in the contested Palk Bay region will be irremediable. The amendment is aimed at curbing local trawlers as well as deterring trawlers from Tamil Nadu. An appropriate response from Tamil Nadu would be to expedite the conversion of its trawlers to deep sea fishing vessels, and not merely condemn Sri Lanka.
Fishermen from both countries have been in talks for a long time to resolve the conflict. Sri Lankan fishermen want an immediate end to incursions by Indian trawlers, and those from Tamil Nadu insist on a three-year phase-out period. The proposal to ban bottom-trawling is two years old, but the amendment has come at a time when a Joint Working Group set up by both countries last year is in place.
Tamil Nadu fishermen are arrested from time to time by the Sri Lankan Navy, and their vessels seized. If more are arrested and slapped with two-year jail terms after a summary trial, as the law now envisages, it may create new flashpoints. Ultimately, the solution lies in the transition from trawling to deep sea fishing, for which a beginning has been made.
The Central and State governments plan to provide 500 deep sea fishing boats with long lines and gill nets this year, as part of a plan to replace 2,000 trawlers in three years. However, the question is whether Sri Lanka can be expected to wait for this plan to be fully implemented before enforcing its bottom trawling ban.
Even while bracing for an escalation as a result of protests from Tamil Nadu, both countries should ensure that the situation does not disrupt regular meetings of the JWG. Besides the fisheries conflict, they need to discuss marine conservation, thus giving equal importance to protecting livelihoods and sustainable fishing.

CB interdicts former EPF Chief Dealer
The Central Bank has interdicted the former Chief Dealer B.H.I Saman Kumara of the Employees Provident Fund from service with effect from July 10, it was revealed yesterday at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue.
Former Chief Dealer Saman Kumara has been holding a managerial position in the EPF prior to the interdiction.
The decision to interdict the senior officer has come as a result of an investigation conducted by the Central Bank regarding him. Evidence was led before the Commission on July 7, 2017 that Saman Kumara has also obtained a loan of Rs. 25 million from the Pan Asia Banking Cooperation.
The EPF senior officer was allegedly involved in the questioned Treasury bond transaction which took place on February 27, 2015.
The EPF has bid on behalf of Perpetual Treasuries Limited at the questioned auction while buying the bonds purchased by Perpetual Treasuries at the same auction in the secondary market. The EPF has not bid on behalf of itself at the questioned Treasury bond auction.
Meanwhile, attention was drawn yesterday at the Commission to a certain recorded conversation between PABC dealers and Saman Kumara. Leading evidence at the Commission, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake requested the Commission to listen to the background conversation taking place while a PABC dealer makes a telephone call to EPFs Saman Kumara. When a call is taken from the recorded line, the background noises also get recorded in.
In the telephone conversation, the caller is waiting until the other end is picked up. Commenting on the delay, the caller converses with the persons who is near him and say, the call is not yet being picked up. The caller is trying to contact EPFs Saman Kumara. Another party to the conversation asks So why are you calling him again and the caller replies The EPF has to come and make an indication regarding a certain transaction.
Commenting on what was said, someone involved in the conversation says The EPF will pretend as if it does not know anything (and answer to the telephone call which is coming from a landline, subjected to recording). The telephone keeps ringing while the background conversation goes on and later on Saman Kumara answers the call and discusses certain transactions.
DSG Minilda Gunatilake pointed out that the background conversation implies that these were no bona fide transactions. These are pre-arranged transactions, he also pointed out.
Commissioner P.S. Jayawardena asked if the deal tickets for these discussed transactions are available for perusal. The Attorney Generals panel confirmed that the documents are available with the Commission.

CIM empowers SL marketers to take on digital transformation
The CIM Sri Lanka annual conference this year is themed, Digital Transformation  are you ready The theme this year has been triggered by the understanding of the harsh reality that most businesses are not yet ready for the digital transformation that would disrupt many industries in the long term.
Similar sentiments were common about the internet and social media earlier in the millennium, when these were seen as game-changers that would bring about the biggest challenge to businesses since the industrial revolution, and such speculations have become a reality today.
Digital transformation is believed to make an even greater impact in comparison to the internet and social media; as it accelerates disruption of every marketplace, abolishing barriers to entry for new competitors from diverse sectors and acts as a major enabler for ambitious new startups that are able to see data (manipulated by technology) as the new oil or the new asset, around which they build their new business.
The good news is that all the changes driven by this digital wave would bring marketers back to one essential question: How can these digital trends help my customer Followed by: How are my competitors using these digital developments to steal my customers
A business without a marketing-oriented digital perspective would not likely survive the next 20 or even 10 years while those that nurture true customer empathy and embrace digital trends, will continue to thrive. This is the reason that the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) has an important role to play in the digital transformation of the country.  This year, CIM Sri Lanka will present its conference goers with the opportunity to delve deeper in to the world of digital and be empowered to face the digital marketing challenges of the future.
CIM Sri Lanka believes that this years conference would see the birth of digital change agents within the marketing fraternity, who would be well-equipped to write their own digital transformation success stories by asking the correct questions and taking the digital transformation discussion to the board level, and ultimately leading the digital transformation at their workplaces.
Paul Smith, the keynote speaker at this years CIM Conference is an author, consultant and renowned marketer from the United Kingdom, who currently functions as an advisor and mentor in digital marketing, communications and digital transition. Graduated from Dublin, Ireland and having earned his MBA from CASS Business School, Paul Smith more popularly known as PR Smith carries over 10 years experience in lecturing, consulting, and is also the founder of a consortium of three universities and an e-learning company specialising in marketing which has reached out to 63 countries worldwide.
Delivering best value to the delegates within a single day on one platform, Smith will be joined by Michael Rogers of KPMG UK and Jerome Thill, Vice President of SABRE (APAC).
In a new and unique conference format put together by the board CIM Sri Lanka, the conference is expected to be a learning experience that would help marketers in Sri Lanka prepare for achieving marketing excellence in 2020 and beyond.

Give them shelter
Mawanella is a large a populous town in the Kegalle District. The population around Mawanella may be about 40,000 people consisting of the three communities: Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims.
Mawanella is a commercial city where a large crowd visits the town for many purposes.
The people in the suburban villages come to Mawanella for many reasons: purchase goods for the daily consumption, to accompany children to schools, reporting to work, visiting the hospitals, banks and divisional secretariat. The common mode of transport is the bus, both state and private sectors. The main problem is that the people do not have a proper bus stand. The present bus stand (pictured) is in tatters.
In the case of a heavy rain, the commuters will be subject to much inconvenience.
This bus stand has been there for over 20 years without the attention of the authorities concerned.
Although Mawanella has been represented by numerous ministers, none of them seems to be interested in reconstructing the bus stand to cater to the visitors of the town.
As a regular visitor to the town by the public transport, I earnestly request the Parliamentarians who represent Mawanella and Kegalle District to reconstruct the bus stand by giving an attractive facelift at the earliest possibility.

Clash of the masters
Welikathara is not just a motion picture but a milestone in Sinhala cinema. Local film veterans; Tissa Abeysekera, Dr D B Nihalsinghe, Dr Gamini Fonseka and Joe Abeywickrama got together decades back to create a masterpiece that could be kept on par with any eastern or western movie.
The cinema subsequent to having undergone a restoration process under the guidance of its director late Dr D B Nihalsinghe is now being screened in the CEL film circuit including Regal and Lido.
Digitally restored
As a stop-gap release, most of the cinema halls screen Welikathara at 4.15pm.
The digitally restored movie is good as new and this monument of a film should not be missed by the young and the old.
The gray-market or the ageing population of filmgoers who enjoyed Welikathara in their youth now bear the responsibility of taking their sons, daughters, nephews and nieces to see the film before its too late.
Welikathara made history as the very first Cinemascope film in South Asia. Although shooting of Paakeeza which was Indias first Cinemascope film commenced earlier, Welikathara was screened first in 1970.
In the film, Gamini Fonseka plays the character of ASP Wickrama Randeniya whose attractive young wife (played by Suwinitha Weerasinghe) gets abducted by the ASPs arch-rival, the underworld king Gorin Mudalali (Joe Abeywickrama) who seeks for vengeance over an old dispute.
Suwinitha Weerasinghe maintains continuity in her character so well to project a high society lady and a wife of a police officer who is torn between two cold-blooded rivals.
With a youthful Gamini Fonseka playing his usual macho character in the film Joe Abeywickrama brought in a highly credible performance as his enemy to rub shoulders with Gamini.
Hollywood level performance
Joes performance in the film was unique and was something that has never been seen before by local filmgoers.
He presented a Hollywood level performance. Joe was confined to comic roles earlier and Welikathara was his major breakthrough to become a character actor.
Speaking to the Daily News some years back on his character in the film Joe Abeywickrama said, I was in the danger-zone being confined to the comic actor category.
When Tissa Abeysekara showed me the Welikathara script, I knew portraying Gorin Mudalalis character in the film would bring me to the next level as a versatile actor. The undying Cowboy within me provided much inspiration to take up the role.
There was some controversy over the screenplay of Welikathara. Some scholars opined the screenplay was changed while shooting of the film was in progress. Joe had this to say about the whole drama.
At one point it seemed like Gamini and I did turn into the real ASP Wickrama Randeniya and Gorin Mudalali. However while shooting the final and climaxing scenes, the unexpected happened. I noticed that the end scenes in the script had been changed.
Joe further went on to say, When I queried about this I was informed, Gorin Mudalali was made to run in the final gun battle with the ASP merely to keep the police department and the public sensor board officials at bay.
In the original script, Gorin Mudalali dies in a face-to-face gun battle with the police battalion. It was supposed to be an eye for an eye situation, leading to a stupefying end.
Dr D B Nihalsinghe in a subsequent interview with the Daily News countered Joe Abeywickramas views by saying, I stuck to the original script while directing Welikathara. Only Joes (Gorin Mudalali) retreating scene was shot with some emphasis as a sole decision made by me. No one influenced me to manipulate with Welikathara script.

Disrupt Asia 2017, Sri Lankas premier startup conference and exhibition will be held today, at Hilton Colombo.
One of the most interesting discoveries post Disrupt Asia 2016 was the opportunities it afforded to the local start up community, industry veterans and aspiring entrepreneurs.
As an IT industry veteran who runs a successful startup that has roots in Silicon Valley, Mangala Karunaratne, Founder and CEO of Calcey Technologies, explains how Disrupt Asia (DA16) contributed to the countrys startup ecosystem. He says, DA brings everyone involved in the startup ecosystem together under one roof and provides a venue for knowledge and experience sharing.According to Karunaratne on a practical level the event is one of the flagship events of the local startup ecosystem and an ideal platform for investors and potential customers of startup products to look for new opportunities. The atmosphere is friendly and enthusiastic. The event brings together a high quality network, especially for startups that show up with a focused game plan - they can get a lot of value from this event.
A classic example how DA16 energised participants to become innovative change makers and create a working foundation for a viable company could be seen in Michael Moonesinghes initiative to start Entrepreneur Hubs, a national network of co-worker small business centres. As CEO of Glover Daniels International, Moonesinghe attended Disrupt Asia conference last year. He says, I attended the conference last year as an investor as I planned to become an Angel investor.

Djibouti: Chinese troops depart for first overseas military base

Ships carrying Chinese troops are heading to Djibouti to set up Beijing's first overseas military base, reports state media outlet Xinhua.
China says the support base will be used for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid in Africa and West Asia.
It will also be used for military co-operation, naval exercises and rescue missions, said the Xinhua report.
The move comes as China has ramped up investment and influence in Africa and the Indian Ocean in recent years.
The Xinhua report did not specify the number of troops or ships that departed for Djibouti, nor when the base would start operations.
It said the Djibouti base came after "friendly negotiations" between the two countries. Previous reports said construction began last year.
Djibouti, a tiny country at the Horn of Africa, hosts military bases for several foreign countries including the US, Japan and France.
It is favoured for its location, as it sits near a busy shipping route and is seen as a model of stability in an otherwise volatile region.
In 2015, Chinapledged to invest $60bn(then 40bn) in Africa's development. That same year it embarked on itsfirst foreign peacekeeping missionin South Sudan.

Eight die each day from road accidents
A road traffic accident is reported in Sri Lanka every ten minutes and two or three persons are injured due to same. Every day eight persons die from road accidents while fatalities number 3000 each year, a Community Physician attached to the Peradeniya University Prof. Samath Dharamaratne said.
He said: At least a fine of Rs.100,000 should be imposed for driving without a valid license and driving under the influence of liquor.
Addressing a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) in Colombo yesterday, Prof. Dharmnaratne said that Sri Lanka is one of the countries in the world that reports the highest number of road traffic accidents and the majority of the victims are young males. Two thirds of the accidents victims become permanently disabled. They are the breadwinners of poor families.
According to Prof. Dharmaratne, the situation may have a direct impact on the inability of getting rid of poverty in the country. The elderly population of Sri Lanka is growing rapidly and there will not be adequate young people to look after them in future if the dangerous upward trend of the road traffic accident situation continues.
Lecturer attached to the Colombo University Dr.Achala Jayatilleke said that one third of road traffic accident victims are poor pedestrians who do not have a vehicle of their own. All road traffic accidents can be prevented. For example, countries such as Japan, Norway, Sweden etc. have cut down the number of traffic accidents by implementing strict laws. In Japan very high fines are imposed for drunk driving.Not only drunk drivers but also the bar owners who sold them liquor and the front seat passenger who sat and let the drunk driver to drive too are fined.

Emirates boosts U.S. economy by US$21 bn
Emirates supported more than 104,000 American jobs and contributed US$21.3 billion in revenue to the U.S. economy, including US$10.5 billion to the countrys GDP and US$6.4 billion of labor income in 2015, according to a study conducted by Campbell-Hill Aviation Group, a well-established economic consulting firm to airlines, airports and the aviation industry, with clients including U.S. and foreign airlines, more than 30 airports, financial institutions and government agencies.
Released on the 25th anniversary of the first Open Skies agreement signed by the U.S., the objective of the study was to quantify the annual economic impact Emirates has on the U.S. economy.
Sir Tim Clark, President of Emirates said: Campbell-Hills data reaffirms the significant stimulative effect of Emirates operations on the U.S. economy. It shows weve brought hundreds of thousands of new travelers to the United States, helped increase competitive air transport options for over a million American and international travelers who flew with us, and contributed to increased demand for U.S. exports in aerospace and many other sectors.
The catalytic impact of Emirates U.S. operations brought over 580,000 new travelers to the U.S. who otherwise would not have travelled there, and generated US$3.2 billion of new trade-based revenue.
Indirect spending within the U.S. by newly stimulated passengers combined with new merchandise and service trade created approximately 30,000 jobs, and US$4.6 billion of new revenues for U.S. businesses, including US$1.7 billion of labor income and US$2.5 billion of GDP.*
To produce this report we have spent many months analysing data and running it through an IMPLAN analysis model which is specifically designed for economic impact analysis at the national level said Dr. Brian Campbell, Principal at Campbell-Hill Aviation Group. Our research shows how Emirates presence in the U.S. and the air connectivity it provides generates significant economic growth by increasing the free flow of international travel and trade. It is also important to note that the more than 100,000 jobs Emirates supports in the U.S. produce widespread benefits across diverse sectors of our economy from professional services, to manufacturing, to education, and to hospitality.
Emirates U.S. economic impact has steadily and significantly increased in recent years. Since launching its initial service to New Yorks John F. Kennedy International Airport in 2004, the airline today provides over 350 connections between the U.S. and the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent, Africa and Asia, and offers travelers from the U.S. more choices of global travel destinations. Emirates flies more than 135 weekly passenger and cargo flights serving 14 U.S. gateways, including recently launched services to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale in Florida, as well as to Newark via Athens.
Emirates purchases more Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft than any other company in the world. In 2015 alone, Emirates received delivery of 11 brand new Boeing 777-300ERs and one Boeing 777-200LRF. Based on U.S. export data for civil aviation aircraft and related commodities, these purchases in 2015 generated approximately US$1.5 billion of direct revenue to the U.S. aircraft manufacturing sector, supported approximately 1,700 direct jobs, US$230 million in labor income and contributed US$445 million to U.S. GDP.
In total, Emirates has 163 Boeing 777 aircraft in its fleet and another 171 on order, in addition to parts and other commodities and services purchased for fleet maintenance.
The Campbell-Hill study results come on the 25th anniversary of the first Open Skies agreement signed by the U.S.

Escape into Albert Museum
The Victoria and Albert Museum popularly know as V & A and contain some of the richest and priceless artefacts and their kind along with paintings mainly by British painters but with originals of others. It was established in 1852 to make works of art available to all and inspire British designers and gained its current name in 1899 when Queen Victoria laid the foundation stone of a new wing and renamed the Museum in memory of her husband, Prince Albert.
Spanning over two thousand years of human creativity, the Museum's rich and diverse collections, virtually every medium and from many parts of the world are represented. These collections are often subject to renewal and restoration for better preservation while the Victorian interiors are both beautiful and stimulating. It is an artist's paradise.
The Galleries of art and design are arranged by place or date and explore the relationship between objects from similar periods, regions and placed in their historical context. V & A's collections of Medieval and Renaissance art are among the most important in the world.
Some of the most exciting elements of the V & A are on and off are programmed to coincide with exhibitions and galleries are transformed into catwalks to display them. Through the strength of its collection and exhibitions, the creativity of modern artists finds a unique with the past and their historical predecessors.
IRONWORK
The Hereford screen that spans one of the galleries was a gigantic art work undertaken by Sir George Gilbert Scott in 1862. It was painted, wrought and cast iron, brass and copper with mosaic and hardstones mixing accordingly. This was a screen that divided the nave from the chancel, the clergy from the congregation that was an essential element of every medieval church but after the Reformation, many screens were ripped off until the arrival of the Gothic Revival of the nineteenth century where some were reinstated. Although Sir George Gilbert was a passionate admirer of the Gothic style, he decided to use iron for his screen at V & A and not the usual wood or stone. The screen was exhibition before finding its permanent place in Hereford Cathedral. Critics praised it as grandest, most triumphant achievement of modern architecture. However, with changing time and onto the 1960s, the screen fell victim to anti-Victorian prejudice and among strong protests, it was dismantled and sold to the Herbert Museum in Coventry, which could not at that time house it. Eventually, in 1983 it was given to V & A and arrived in 14000 thousand, broken, rustling and flaking. The reconstruction work took over a year that turned out to be yet another triumph of modern conservation and bears testimony to Sir George Gilbert Scott's spectacular creativity.
ARCHITECTURE
No one going to Sydney will miss its Sydney Opera House not because it is the major landmark but for its heavenly interior that has become a class of its own, worldwide. How it came to be is itself a triumph for humanity and leading that dream was Jorn Utzon who won the Sydney Opera House competition in 1957 when no one knew how to build the roof structure he had designed. Utzon's concept showed huge billowing shells resting on narrow points but the engineer, Ove Arup had seen immediately that the shells would not sustain the forces they would generate. He found them irregular and could not be defined mathematically. Also, Prefabrication and calculation were both impossible.
Discouraged poor Utzon nearly cried and resigned to himself and said, 'We had precedent to go on. It was like climbing Mount Everest for the first time. Three years later, Utzon was in for a shock when the work on the site had already started. He found the solution - in an orange. By cutting ' spherical triangles' from the skin, he discovered a regular basis for the irregular forms he wished to create. To develop his idea further, he made a wooden model. (Three such wooden models are carried along with this article) Arup was able to design a structure in which a framework of pre - fabricated, tapering ribs of identical curvature could support a thin skin. The idea of frameless shells had been lost, but Utzon's vision was now realised.
THE ASIAN DREAM
Nothing much to crow about though V & A has an outstanding collection of Asian art displaying from East Asia while those from South and South East are at the opposite end of the main corridor near the Raphael Gallery. Art from East Asia and the Islamic world can also be seen in some of the material and techniques such as ceramic, glass and textiles. Yet the lack of African art never been comprehensively collected for display.
Where was Sri Lanka My eyes scrutinised all on display in the Asian galleries and never found anything of India.
Maybe I missed some. Fairly disappointed, I made it to the exit when I saw in a corner, upon a pedestal stood the mighty Sri Lankan elephant in all his majesty, studded and decorated with precious Sri Lankan gems that revealed our culture and historical significance That completed my day at the V & A Museum.

FR petition filed by Gnanasara Thera re-fixed for support

The Supreme Court re-fixed a Fundamental Rights petitionfiledby Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda AtteGnanasaraThera for support today who sought a declaration that the order given by the Homagama Magistrate to keep him in remand custody is unlawful and is a violation of his Fundamental Rights guaranteed in the Constitution.
Accordingly, the petition will be taken up for support on October 9.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
In his petition,GnanasaraThera maintained that the statement made by him when getting ready to leave Court on January 25, 2016 addressing complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda can in no way amount to be a threat made to injure a person or her reputation, nor can it be said that the statement so made would cause alarm to a person.
The petitioner stated that on a complaint by Sandhya Ekneligoda on January 25, 2016 to Homagama Police, the first respondent, OIC Miscellaneous Complaints had arrested him and produced him before the Homagama Magistrate's Court on January 26.
GnanasaraThera stated that complainant Sandhya Ekneligoda after attending the Magistrate's Court was getting ready to leave Court when he told her Thoge miniha LTTE karayek uu malane, tho hingakapiya.
The petitioner stated that the Police alleged that he had committed an offence under section 486 of the Penal Code.
He said upon being produced, the petitioner was remanded by the Magistrate until February 9 and then he was remanded till February 10.
He stated that the Police further alleged that he had committed offences under section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act of no. 4 of 20. He said he was ordered to be further remanded till February 23.
The petitioner maintained that there was no justifiable reason for the Magistrate to make an order of remand with the statement so made in as much as such statement does not constitute an offence under section 483 of the Penal Code and section 8 (1) (a) of Assistance to Protection of Victims of Crimes and Witnesses Act.
The attorney-at-law whofiledthis petition on behalf of Gnasara Thera moved Court that the petition be taken up for support on March 16, 17 or 18.

Fuelled by zeal
An impressive figure, an inimitable voice, a veteran with the gush of words to suit the audience  all this goes on to describe Dr Vijaya Corea. Born in Corea Walauwa to Dr C V S Corea and Amybelle Corea, Vijaya Corea was educated at S. Thomas College, Mt Lavinia. Music ran in his genes as his father was a violinist and his mother sat at the Piano, both being lovers of English Classical Music.
Q: What was your starting point
A: That was a divine appointment. It was in 1963 that I happened to step into Radio Ceylon to meet my cousin, Vernon Corea who then was in a panic situation; the American Guest Artiste who had not arrived to take part in the programme. I ended up hesitantly taking his place and handling the birthday spot on the childrens programme Kiddies Corner. When I heard my own voice on the air, I said to myself wow.
With high spirit, I crept into Radio Ceylon on the following Saturday too expecting my cousin to give me another opportunity. But he said no, and there are rules. I cannot do that. Last time, it was an exigency. Crestfallen, I returned home and told my father who contacted his patient and good friend, Livy Wijemanne, Director/Commercial Service regarding my inspiration.
The net result was that I continued regularly thereafter.
I was 21 then. Joe Sothinathan who recognised me on the road told me to look up the Government Gazette and apply for the Relief Announcers Post. Consequently, I emerged number one from among 350 applicants.
Q: And you remained faithful to broadcasting and gave up on other career prospects
A: While I was on the air, Zellers Confectionaries Managing Director Ariyapala Samaraweera insisted that I be the Presenter of their programme Limelighters with Zellers. From then on, I was known to be the most popular commercial broadcaster. I was personally remunerated by the advertisers. Having taken to broadcasting like a duck to water and having realised that I was earning more than the salary of a Chartered Accountant which then was Rs 1500, I gave up Accountancy and hung on this line.
Q: What was the feeling like when you captured the microphone for the first time
A: My first opportunity was to compere the relay of the Regatta Ball from the Rowing Club live on the air with the Harold Seneviratne Combo on the bandstand. When I was invited for the first time to compere a dance, the organisers offered to compensate me for my professional services with a bottle on the table, plenty of cigarettes and a good time. I refused point blank and insisted on a fee. I am proud to say, even if humbly, that it is I who made being a Master of Ceremonies a fee earning profession. That was in 1965.
Q: You came to be known as Sri Lankas number one compere. I think you still are. In your heyday, there was no big show or dance without you being the compere. Am I correct
A: At times there were very tight schedules. One Saturday, I was in Kandy engaged to compere the Sooriya Show at St. Anthonys Hall, Katugastota and in Colombo thereafter to compere a Dinner Dance at the Ceylinco Ballroom. On another occasion, similarly from Galle to Colombo. I catered to all with zeal and no hesitation.
Q: But you managed to strike a balance between the SLBC and the freelance work
A: The Morning Show on the English Commercial Service every Wednesday was compiled by me. Many who were listeners in the 1960s and 70s remember even today how I used to begin with my signature tune In the Mood.
Later that year on a certain morning when I was rostered to be on the air on the All Asia service and to read the news on the internal service, there was a big commotion and pandemonium in the corridor - the Sinhala Announcer had not arrived and there were just five minutes for the morning transmission to begin. With a big question, all crippled!
I took a unilateral decision in the interest of the Radio Station to commence the English Transmission 45 seconds in advance and then proceeded to the Sinhala Studio and presented the first programme until the Sinhala Relief Announcer for whom transport had been sent arrived. Again, I received a letter of commendation from the Chairman/Director General appreciating the stand I took which had saved the image of the Radio Station and also prevented a loss of revenue.
Q: You have been referred to as a star maker. How did you bring and promote this chain of musicians
A: I wanted to open the doors for the gifts and talents of Sri Lankan musicians and singers to be brought to the fore. I presented a programme titled Saturday Star each week at 9 pm. Those whom I featured on the programme included Los Caballeros, La Ceylonians, Pink and Purple, Clarence, Annesley and the Moonstones, Indrani Perera and the Three Sisters, La Bambas, Los Flamencos, Dharmaratne Brothers and many others. Paul Fernando, the Gypsies and Milton Mallawarachchi were also introduced for the first time to listening audiences by me. Famous singers like C T Fernando, H R Jothipala and M S Fernando were given a new lease of life on the showbiz scene as I promoted them on my programmes on the air.
Q: What are your happiest memories
A: When I became the first ever presenter in Sri Lanka on television during the worldwide telecast of the fifth Non-Aligned Conference which took place at BMICH and was covered by Yugoslav Radio Television (YAGREB).

Gangnam Style is no longer the most-played video on YouTube

Psy's Gangnam Style is no longer the most-watched video on YouTube.
The South Koreanmegahithad been the site's most-played clip for the last five years.
The surreal video became so popular that it"broke" YouTube's play counter, exceeding the maximum possible number of views (2,147,483,647), and forcing the company torewrite its code.
But the song has now been overtaken by another music video - Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth'sSee You Again.
The heart-wrenching ballad has now been streamed 2,895,373,709 times; beating Psy's current count of 2,894,426,475 views.
Adding it up, that means See You Again has been streamed for a total of 21,759 years. If one person was to listen to each of those streams consecutively, they'd have to have started during the glacial peak of the last Ice Age.
"I joined YouTube in 2007 hoping to make a video that would reach 10,000 views,"wrote Charlie Puth on Twitter. "Just heard about See You Again... Wow."
The song was written for the action movie Furious 7, playing over the closing credits in tribute to the actor Paul Walker, who died in a car accident before the film was completed.
With its unabashedly sentimental lyrics ("it's been a long day without you my friend/ And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again"), See You Again has become one of the mostfrequently requestedpop songs at funerals in the UK.
It was the best-selling song worldwide in 2015, and received best song nominations at both the Grammys and the Oscars.
The music video features the final scene of Furious 7, in which the two main characters Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Cody Walker, filling in for his brother, Paul), drive side-by-side, sharing a smile for the last time before they pull onto separate roads and drive into the sunset.
As the camera pans up into the sky, a title card reads "For Paul" and the video ends.
The video reached 1 billion views in six months, and hit 2 billion last September. However, its reign as YouTube's most-watched clip may be short-lived.
Luis Fonsi's summer smashDespacitohas racked up 2.5 billion views in just six months, and it shows no signs of slowing down.
The Puerto Rican song - sung in a mixture of Spanish and English - has been number one in the UK for the last eight weeks, thanks in part to a remix featuring Justin Bieber.
Whoever takes the title, though, its good news for Universal Music, which owns all of the songs.
Meanwhile, 47 of the top 50 clips on YouTube are music videos, proving the importance of the streaming site to the music industry - despite the fact the two sides arelocked in a battleover royalty payments.
According to analysis byMidia Research, every stream on YouTube generates $0.001 for the music industry.
If accurate, that means Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth's song has earned $2.9m (2.2m) from YouTube - roughly the same amount it has made from 665 million plays on Spotify.

Government condominiums to tenants for keeps
The government has appointed a Task Force to develop a mechanism to transfer state owned condominium and non-condominium properties to those who have lived in them for more than 15 years.
The Condominium Management Authority has invited the relevant families to provide their information, in pursuance of government policy of empowering 3 million citizens to become land and house owners.
A Committee was appointed by the Housing and Construction Ministry for the establishment of a clearly defined, fair, stable and enforceable system of property rights in land and housing, Authority sources said.
Presenting his Economic Policy Statement in 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe pledged to empower three million citizens to become land and house owners. The government is addressing this commitment on several fronts. Proposals for the modernization of the surveys and registration systems have already been mooted, while new initiatives for recognizing the rights and legitimacy of the urban poor have been launched.
Seeking the transfer of state owned houses to their long term occupants is one of the key objectives of the government and around 1,000 families, including those who resettled after Tsunami will also be benefitted through this initiative.

Government to move on polythene management

The Cabinet approved a proposal brought forward by President Maithripala Sirisena today, to implement short-term, medium-term and long-term strategies to manage the use of polythene and minimize its environmental impact.
The short-term measures to reduce the accumulation of non-degradable items, recommended by a Committee appointed by the President, include the following:
Prohibition of polythene for decoration

Allow the use of polythene less than 20 microns for essential activities only, on the approval of the Central Environment Authority (CEA) Prohibition of sale, importation and production of lunch sheets
Prohibition of sale importation and production of containers, plates, cups and spoons made using polystyrene
Prohibition of sale of processed or cooked meals packed in polythene containers
Promotion of providing paper, cloth or reed bags or biologically degradable plastics for customers purchasing items from a store
Prohibition of burning polythene and plastic in open places
Introduction and promotion of biologically degradable polythene and plastics
As mid-term measures the committee proposed the provision of tax concessions on the importation of machinery used in biologically degradable plastic production and imposing a cess tax of 15% on the importation of plastic raw material.
The long-term goal, as envisaged by the committee, is to completely prohibit recycled plastic products.

Govt built 55-ft long two multi-day boats released to sea
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera released two 55 feet multi-day fishing trawlers at the Negombo Fisheries Harbour, recently.
This was part of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministrys programme to produce multi-day fishing trawlers with all modern facilities for fishing, to replace fishing vessels used by fishermen. The fishing vessels are over than 55 feet long.
The programme is carried out under the concept of Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
The production is carried out by Cey-Nor Foundation. The multi-day fishing trawlers are under 50 percent subsidy.
The ministry has planned to produce 10 multi-day marine vessels. The programme started in 2016.The minister addressing the gathering said, Sri Lanka is using a large number of small fishing vessels. According to the statistics of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), our fishermen have over 65,000 fishing boats. However, we have 1,400 large multi-day boats. Although we use a large number of fishing boats, the size of our catch is not enough for the entire country. Around Rs. 70 million is spent to produce this multi-day fishing vessel.
Forty percent of our catch is going to waste. The reason is that small boats are not in good condition. We need to take action to avoid post-harvest wastage. If we are catching fish for the international market, we need to provide high quality fish. We have all the modern facilities available on our new vessels, the minister said.According to international law, fishing nets are no longer being used for fishing. Instead, a method called Long Lines is used. There should be facilities to preserve fish in fishing vessels. All of this is available in the new boats. It also has the ability to share information via satellite, the minister said.
Ministry Secretary Mangalika Adikari and Deputy Minister Dr. Sudharshanie Fernandopulle also participated.

He made this observation addressing the media at the Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry auditorium yesterday.
If there are allegations against them, they should be investigated, the minister said.
Minister Soysa said the SLFP is not of the view that the Constitution should be replaced with a new one, but it should be amended to solve the national issue.
The government has no intention to change the clause that guarantees the position of Buddhism in the country, Minister Soysa said.
The minister said the Uma Oya project that commenced during the previous regime is a failure as it has been decided to construct within a family cabinet. But the Government would not abandon the project since USD 500 million has been spent on the project, he said.
Only the JVP needs to abandon the project, the Minister said. He said those who were affected by the failure of the project would be given compensation.
Minister Soysa said no minister or deputy minister would join the Joint Opposition as they have joined the government voluntarily to take forward the policy of the good governance government.
However, the government would not grant special privileges to keep the ministers or the deputies, Minister Soysa said.
The minister said the Bill on Enforced Disappearances is important as the country does not need to see abductions.

Gunmen kill eight in Thailand over personal conflict
THAILAND: Eight people, including three children, were killed by gunmen posing as government officials in Thailands Krabi province, police said Tuesday, a mass slaying investigators believe was sparked by a personal conflict.
Police say a gang of six or seven men, dressed in camouflage outfits, stormed a house in the southern province around 4:00 pm (0900 GMT) on Monday.
They took ten people hostage and waited for the owner of the property to return.
Around 8pm the owner arrived, all of them (the victims) were handcuffed and blindfolded until midnight when gunmen opened fire, Chaiwut Buathong, chief of Ao Luek district, told AFP.
Six died at the scene, two others died in hospital, Chaiwut said, adding three of the victims were girls aged under 15.
Three others were taken to hospital with one in critical condition.
Deputy national police spokesman Krissana Pattanacharoen told reporters the victims came from a local Muslim family and that the gunmen claimed to be officials who wanted to check on illegal activity.
Photos taken by medical workers showed two bodies slumped on a blood-splattered childrens bed, with a teddy bear thrown to one side.
It is under investigation but initially police suspect this is a personal conflict, Major General Worawit Panprung, from Krabi provincial police, told AFP.
Firearm ownership is common in Thailand and the country boasts one of the highest gun-related homicide rates in Asia.
Petty arguments and disputes frequently turn deadly but mass organised killings are rare.
Krabi province is a popular holiday destination boasting beaches like Ao Nang and Rai Ley, though Mondays killings took place in an area removed from the main tourist drags.
The province boasts a large Muslim community who have lived in the region for centuries.
They are Thai speakers and ethnically different from the Malay-speaking Muslims in the countrys three southernmost provinces where a violent nationalist insurgency has raged against the central government for more than a decade.- AFP

(HNB, B1 negative, b15) received shareholder approval for a Rs. 15 billion (US$190 million) rights issue that will boost the banks capital buffer well above the Basel III requirements that took effect in Sri Lanka on July 1, a credit positive, Moodys said in a statement issued recently.
The bank will complete the rights issuance by the end of this month.
Moodys estimates that the rights issuance will add 230 basis points to HNBs Tier 1 ratio, bringing it to 12.9% (see Exhibit 1) well above Sri Lankan banks new 10% regulatory minimum, with which banks must comply by January 2019. The rights issuance will position HNBs Tier 1 ratio above the ratios of its domestic peers. Sri Lankan banks have been dealing with shrinking capital buffers as loan growth exceeds the growth of banks retained earnings.
System loan growth was 17.5% in 2016, while retained earnings  particularly at state-owned banks  was negatively pressured by high cash dividend payouts that averaged 75% for that year.
HNBs higher capital buffer will support its loan growth over the next 12-18 months. Moodys expects HNBs loan volume to grow by 20% annually during 2017-19, in line with its year-on-year growth rate at the end of March.
In this scenario, where it also assumes 20% cash dividends every year, HNBs Tier 1 ratio would be around 13% at the end of 2019 (see Exhibit 2). In a different scenario, where annual loan growth is 25%, Moodys estimates the capital buffer would be around 12% at the end of 2019.
The shareholders approval of the rights issue is a positive step following HNBs previously stalled plan to raise capital.
HNB had planned to raise capital in 2016 from the Asian Development Bank (Aaa stable), but some shareholders blocked the transaction.

Hidden language of the soul
Today in the Indian classical dance forms face a lot of confusion about the style differences about the existing styles of Kathak and Bharatha Natyam. Especially among the Indian classical dance forms Bharatha Natyam and Kathak dances have different styles. It is a must that there should be a proper understanding and knowledge about the styles of Indian classical dances among the audience, and the Fine Arts faculties of the universities of Sri Lanka about the styles of Indian Classical dances.
Bharatha Natyam is one topmost outstanding classical dances of India. It preserves its own identity in the international spheres. Whatever it is, in the international spheres Bharatha Natyam has its own identity with its glamour. In practical Bharatha Natyam field, two main existing popular styles are facing severe cold war within the dance field itself.
Different styles
It is a pity to note that most of the followers of these styles criticise one another. Originally there were four different well-known styles existed. Those were Pantha Nallur, Vazhuvuoor, Thanjavur and Kanchipuram. Thanjavur and Kanchipuram have virtually disappeared.
Bharatha Natyam is basically divided into Nirtha, Nirthya and Natya. Nirtha dance is firmly based on pure Adavus (steps) and poses. Adavus (steps) are fundamental in any dance, and these Adavus are generally common to all dances. Adavus are executed with selective Thala (rhythm), Laya, and Kala (tempo). In Bharatha Natyam the category of adavus is same for both the styles. But in the way of execution of Adavus, reflect slight and certain variations.
These slight variations came into being, due to the approaches of different teachers stationed in different areas.
These slight differences have given a popular misconception that there are different types of Bharatha Natyam. It is wrong to say that Bhartha Natyam could be divided into two different types of Bharatha Natyam. It is more appropriate and correct to say that Bharatha Natyam has two different styles or two different schools in Bharatha Natyam instead of saying two different types of Bharatha Natyam or two different categories of Bharatha Natyam.
There is a vast difference between the two terminologies of style and type. The word style is different from the word type.
The word style reveals the methodology of execution. The term type reveals the nature or character of one. Hence one must understand the basic differences between the two terminologies. Among the two existing styles of Bharatha Natyam, the Vazhuvoor style of Bharatha Natyam gives more preference and importance to the facial expression, bava and rasas. The execution of adavus in Vazhuvoor style is gentle rather than that of the Pantha Nallur style.
Practical performance
Pantha Nallur gives more importance to the Nirtha especially it emphasises the firm and stiff way of execution of adavus (steps). Anyhow, outwardly it is said that Bharatha Natyam has no style differences.
But practically in the performing field, it is noticeable that Bharatha Natyam has certain differences between the two existing styles. Vazhuvoor style and Pantha Nallur style are the main existing style in the Bharatha Natyam field with their certain identity.

Theoretically, Bharatha Natyam styles have no differences. Both the styles of Bharatha Natyam follow the same theory. Basically, History, origin, development, a number of Adavus and category of adavus remain the same for these two existing styles.
The eye movements, neck movements, body positions, leg positions, leg movements, hand positions, hand movements, hand gestures, divisions of Abinayas, are same for both styles.
Generally, style is a framework of individual teachers but it has not changed the basic concept or aspect or format of the selective dance form. Bharatha Natyam remains as Bharatha Natyam whatever the styles it is.
Pantha Nallur style has an exceptional beauty in the way of performing the pure Nirtha; meanwhile, Vazhuvoor style has an excellent beauty in the way of execution of Nirthtya aspects such as facial expression, Bava and rasa.
It gives more room for the imaginative creativity. In the Pantha Nallur style, the scope of expressions is limited. But both the styles have their own excellence and their own footing, despite certain differences.
Mediocre artistes
But unfortunately, the present dance world of Sri Lanka has missed the capability of comparing and analysing the differences, of these two outstanding and existing Bharatha Natya styles with a broad mind and manner. Followers of each style are always projecting and praising their own selective style as the best style and ridicule the other style. All these occur due to the ignorance of the mediocre artistes.
Similarly, four main styles also exist in the other Indian classical dance Kathak. Those are Lucknow style, Banaras style, Jaipur style and Varanasi style. But the two main and major popular styles or schools in Kathak are Lucknow and Jaipur styles. Kathak originates from the tradition known as Katha. The Sanskrit lexicon defines Kathak as storyteller or narrator of drama'. According to certain historical evidence, Kathak dance came into being from a particular social community named kathaka, who were the custodians of this dance form. Professional storytellers of this caste dramatised the epic and religious stories with full expression, miming and acting.
Kathak also originated in temples. Later, it developed in the royal courts. During the 19th century, Kathak faced a new era. Kathak is considered as an outstanding classical dance form of India. It is proud to be a fusion of Indo-Moghal cultural trends. Especially, this particular dance form flourished under the Moghul Empire. Kathak is the only classical dance form of India closely linked with Muslim culture and Muslim traditions.
Thakur Prasad and his two sons Kalka Prasad and Binda Din served in Wajid Ali Shahs royal court. They are fully responsible for the development of Lucknow Gharana (style).With the passage of time, under their guidance beautiful verses, rhythmic syllabus and melodious musical compositions were introduced. This gave birth to the Lucknow Gharana.
Dance movements
Graceful and expressive Bhava, are the predominating characters of this Gharana. Yet, this Gharana also uses maximum footwork. A special feature of Kathak is that the dance movements even in high tempo are enriched with bhava, rasa, and abhinaya. It is generally believed that the Jaipur Gharana, originated in Rajasthan. The credit for developing this style goes to Iswari Prasad Misra who himself belonged to a traditional Kathak family. After his death, his family members continued his work. Kathak was also preserved in the royal courts by another ruler in Madhya Pradesh named by Raja Charander Singh. He wanted to bring the two different styles together. As all other styles of classical dance forms, two different styles of Kathak do not have rigid differences in the basic concept of Kathak.
As in classical Bharatha Natyam, the so-called styles were developed by the gurus stationed in different areas. The styles are imaginary creations of the masters who developed certain aspects in the dance. It is worthy to mention that the martial arts such as Karate, Khufu and Judo also have their own different styles. Simply it could be said that these differences arose due to the adoption of certain different techniques.

Increase in womens representation in PCs gazetted
The Government on Monday gazetted the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Bill to increase the number of female representatives in Provincial Councils. The Bill seeks to amend the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988.
This makes it binding on all political parties and independent groups to field at least 30 per cent female candidates in Provincial Council elections.
As per the Bill, the returning officers have the authority to reject any nomination paper which does not contain the number of female candidates required to be nominated.
The Bill has been issued by Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha as a Supplement to the Gazette on July 7.
The Government has taken a policy decision to increase the female representation in all political decision-making bodies. As the first step, the Government in March last year amended the Local Authorities Election Act to include 25 percent quota for women at the Local Government elections.
An Elections Department official said that female representation in Provincial Councils is about 4 percent as of now. The female representation in Parliament is about 5 percent.
Elections to the North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils are due in October.

Lady bereft of fear
It is a few days since I watched the film. I am not a film critic yet I feel that I have a duty by the film industry in Sri Lanka that I pen my thoughts and feelings down on watching the film. Hence I assume that I must be struck by it enough to want to do so.
The film starts with the main character engaged in manual work. He, along with us, listens to a reading of a book on traditional values allotted to a good woman. She should be this, she should not be this kind of narration with constant punctuations by the listener, creating somewhat a comic effect.
Then comes the part where the two men arrive at a hospital in order to bring back a dead body of a woman Suddi by name. The relation of the men to the women is not revealed though it is obvious that they are adamant to take the corpse home as cheaply as possible. Scenes connected to this is full of realism, though some such as the scene where the main character is left with the dead woman, and he uncovers the body instigates in us a surge of questions, making us participate in the experience.
Male behaviour
The return journey is long, one would feel. Yet the handling of it is such that it does contribute to the unravelling of the story. The scenery surrounding the journey is spectacular, the peaceful lush greenery of the mountains, the occasional boutiques is so realistically portrayed that one is made to feel the tranquillity of the atmosphere. The very maleness of the behaviour of the three men in a close relationship through the journey and the comradeship they seem to share in their behaviour, their conversation and the jokes they share is amusing and entertaining.
This is in stark reality to the magic realism of the occasional scenes inserted in between. The occasions where flashbacks as well as the scenes where Suddi, the corpse talks reveal the connection of the past to the present and assists the spectator to understand many that were unsaid.... such as her marriage to a man considerably older than her expecting acceptance and security, how her very attractiveness became her traitor, the ways of the village and the irony of the female victim becoming the perpetrator. The experiences and accusations compelling her to leave her home and come to the big city.
Consequently how she becomes one of the many girls how had joined the trade for multiple reasons. Her ultimate destiny of becoming a commodity that has value as an object of fun or a victim of fantasy and frustration of males. The ignorance of the girl child of the facts of life and the humbling force of necessity making her face the ugly cruelty and perils of a world without compassion or sympathy.
Pay respect!
Yet it is constantly reminded that Suddi should be treated with respect. This is the ugly face of the society which hurts and condemns a person while living but is quick to honour the same once one is dead. The village waits for the corpse of Suddi to be brought back -No doubt to pay respect to the corporeal, short of memory of how they had crushed her spirit, making her life unbearable.
It is at the end that the identity of her husband is revealed. It was the person who showed extreme anxiety of bringing her home with respect. Yet the real end presents a thundering revelation. That is the fact that, though he is her husband he had not seen her naked body before! The statement poses many questions of sex and sexuality at the personal and the social level. Had she passively endured life in the unit of family and village, would she have been respected as a good woman Would she have found happiness and fulfilment
Many could present various arguments. Yet the question will remain up to discussion.
Irony mixes with sarcasm in the glaring fact that in the cultural context sex is taboo to women. Sex education is not provided in a systematic manner even school. Yet they are the ones who are expected to work it. it is with the cynicism that one is made to realise that respect gained through chastity while enjoyment is gained otherwise, through the ones who are condemned in society. In this case, the respect that Nimalasiri insists on is thought-provoking. Though being an ignorant uneducated villager, has he concluded that Suddi is innocent and chaste in mind and spirit, despite the knowledge of the type of work she did in the big city
Victims scream
The meaning of the number 28 is said to refer to the menstrual period of the female. And it is refreshingly noted that there are no sex scenes inserted as a mode of entertainment. Nor is there violence. This is evident in the fact that although Suddi does not die naturally. She had met with an extremely violent death may be at the hands of one of her customers. The incident is not displayed on the screen but the sobbing and screaming of the victim in the background regarding her death says it all.
The spectator, without actually seeing the scene, is made to participate in the eye of the mind and visualise it in imagination. The device is obviously very effective. I am reminded of the manner how the Classical tragedians in ancient Greek drama refrained from depicting violence on stage. According to them, the reason is that the scenes would offend the refined people. The scenes described on stage or background sound effect would enable the audience to participate and even experience the action.
I also commend the cast and the crew for a job well done. It is their commitment I feel that the film had been so effective. Seminis serene face evokes many emotions in the onlooker. She uses her expression well, according to the situation she describes. Mahendra, Rukmal and Jayasiri the threesome who engage in the journey through their realistic acting enlivens the pathos of the saga partly amidst comic relief. The film is thought-provoking while it is entertaining. But the final statement of Nimalasiri is a masterstroke.

LankaClear records highest ever revenue of Rs 801 mn
LankaClear (Private) Limited,the operator of Sri Lankas National Payment Network LankaPay, held its 15th Annual General Meeting on June 28, 2017 at the Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.
LankaClear recorded the best ever financial performance in over 15 years of its existence by achieving the highest ever revenue of Rs801mn at a healthy YoY growth of 33% and Profit before tax of Rs322mn indicating a very positive bottom line.
This growth was predominantly driven by the new product lines under the Common Card and Payment System (CCAPS) and confirms that the company is on the right track with appropriate strategies that have been executed to perfection during the year paving the way to exceed the anticipated results.
The Company also maintained a healthy Return on Asset (RoA) ratio of 16% and Return on Equity (RoE) ratio of 17%, which indicated YoY growth of 33% and
31% respectively.LankaClear closed the year with a strong balance sheet with Net Assets reaching Rs.1.7 billion, which was a 20% growth compared to the previous year. The company also declared the highest ever dividend for the shareholders in 2016/17.
The financial year 2016/17 saw an impressive growth in the adoption of services of LankaClear as well as agreater penetration of electronic payments. The most spectacular growth was achieved in the transaction volumes of the real time payments area (CEFTS) where the company achieved a phenomenal YoY growth of 1553%. The primary driver for this was the fact that LankaClear team was able to attract a larger number of new members to the system during the year.
The company also experienced an impressive YoY volume growth of 83.5% to reach a cash withdrawal volume of 26 million in the Common ATM Switch (CAS) where the total monthly cash withdrawal and balance inquiry volumes exceeded 3.5 million transactions towards the latter part of the year.
Contrary to the popular beliefs that cheque volumes would go down with more and more citizens and businesses adopting electronic payment modes, in reality, the volume of CITS grew YoY by 4.55%. When the reason for this growth was analyzed, it was discovered that a major contributor to this growth was volumes from the North and the East. During the year 2016/17, the total number of ATMs connected to the Common ATM Switch (CAS) grew to over 3,950 island wide accounting for 99.5% of the total ATMs in the country.

Mathews steps down as Sri Lanka captain

Angelo Mathewshas stepped down as Sri Lanka captain in all three formats, following his side's 3-2 ODI series loss to Zimbabwe.
Mathews, who called the defeat "one of the lowest points" of his career and said in its aftermath that he would discuss his captaincy future with the SLC selectors, conveyed his decision to the selectors on Tuesday.
Mathews has led Sri Lanka in 34 Tests, 98 ODIs and 12 T20Is, having taken the reins at the age of 25, in 2013.
Though Sri Lanka have been modest in limited-overs cricket through the latter half of his tenure, they have, on his watch, tasted rare success in the Test format. In 2014, Mathews had personally played a pivotal role in the Test series triumph in England.
Last year, Sri Lanka had also whitewashed Australia - a side they had won only one Test against previously.
There have also been significant lows under Mathews, however. Sri Lanka's campaigns in the 2015 World Cup, the 2016 World T20 and the 2017 Champions Trophy were disappointing, and even in the Test format, they suffered two 0-2 whitewashes in New Zealand, and a 0-3 result in South Africa. All told, Mathews has 13 Test victories to his name as captain, against 15 losses.
On the batting front, Mathews had an outstanding 2014, in which he scored 1,317 runs at an average of 87.8, but his form had since fallen away, though his average as captain still remains 50.94.
With the ball, he was only sporadically effective in Tests, but much more valuable a limited-overs bowler.
The last year of Mathews' captaincy was characterised by injury, however.
He missed two Tests and an ODI tri-series in Zimbabwe as a result of multiple leg injuries, was absent for a five-match ODI series against South Africa thanks to a torn hamstring, missed Bangladesh's tour of the island, and was most recently unavailable for Sri Lanka's Champions Trophy fixture against South Africa - though it is possible he wasprevented from playingthat game by the board.
The injuries have usually come when Mathews has had a high bowling workload, which he has attempted to carefully manage during his captaincy.
The announcement that he would resign from the captaincy was not unexpected.
The paucity of Sri Lanka's returns in 2017 had placed substantial pressure on Mathews, and applied fresh scrutiny on his on-field strategising and decision-making, which has largely been seen to be Mathews' weakest suit as captain.
The series loss against Zimbabwe has been particularly chastening to the Sri Lanka team - they had never lost a match to Zimbabwe at home before, let alone a series.
Sri Lanka are due to name a successor to Mathews - in the Test format at least - early on Wednesday. Upul Tharanga, who has led the ODI team when Mathews has been injured, and Dinesh Chandimal, who has served as Mathews' deputy and led the T20 team in the past, are prime candidates. Rangana Herath, who captained the most-recent Sri Lanka Test, may be an option as well.

Introduced at an attractive price point, the phone is getting the attention of a new generation of consumers who opt for a feature phone as their second phone as well as among budget conscious consumers who want a sleek and sturdy phone with minimum investment.
The device has a 2.4-inch colour screen and an alphanumeric keypad, featuring a 11 Hour battery life on standby and 8 hours of talk-time on a single charge depending on the network conditions. In terms of storage, the device has 32MB of internal storage that can be expanded up to 8GB.

Nadal in new Wimbledon misery as Murray, Federer coast
London: Rafael Nadals bittersweet relationship with Wimbledon endured another twist Monday when he was knocked out in a five-set, fourth round epic by Luxembourg journeyman Gilles Muller.
Nadals stunning 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 15-13 defeat came after defending champion Andy Murray and seven-time winner Roger Federer had cruised into the last-eight in straight sets.
The four hour and 48-minute stunner on Court One had the knock-on effect of pushing Novak Djokovics last-16 clash against Frances Adrian Mannarino back to Tuesday.
Djokovic had been the last match scheduled on the court but officials chose to postpone the tie instead of shifting it to Centre Court where it could, if necessary, have been completed under lights.
Just weeks after winning his 10th French Open title, Nadal was condemned to his fifth exit before the quarter-finals in his last five visits to Wimbledon. It was not my best match against a very uncomfortable opponent, said world number two Nadal, the 2008 and 2010 champion.
Spains Rafael Nadal reacts after losing aginst Luxembourgs Gilles Muller in their mens singles fourth round match on the seventh day of the 2017 Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, southwest London, on July 10. AFP
Well done to him. He played great, especially in the fifth set but I fought to the last ball.
Nadal converted just two of 16 break points, while Muller fired 30 aces and 95 winners.
Muller, seeded 16th, will make his first Wimbledon quarter-final appearance against former US Open champion Marin Cilic on Wednesday.
Tired! It was a long match. I did really well in the first two sets then Rafa stepped it up and in the end it was just a big battle, said Muller, who won on a fifth match point, more than an hour and a half after his first.
In a pulsating final set, which stretched to 95 minutes, Nadal saved two match points in the 10th game and two more in the 20th.
In between, Muller had to fight off a break point in the 13th game and four more in the 19th.
Nadal was always chasing the score and he finally cracked in the 28th game of the decider when he went long with a return.
I said, just give it a shot, go 100 percent, and its a great feeling to be winning that match, added Muller whose only other win over the great Spaniard also came at Wimbledon, 12 years ago.
Defending champion Murray reached a 10th successive Wimbledon quarter-final with a 7-6 (7/1), 6-4, 6-4 win over Frances Benoit Paire.
World number one Murray will face Sam Querrey for a place in the semi-finals.
Only Federer and Jimmy Connors (11 each) have reached more consecutive Wimbledon quarter-finals than Murray.
Murrays win meant that with Johanna Konta also making the last-eight in the womens tournament, it is the first time since 1973 that Britain has two players in the quarter-finals.
Federer reached his 50th Grand Slam quarter-final and 15th at Wimbledon with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 win over Grigor Dimitrov.
The Swiss star will now face Milos Raonic, the 2016 runner-up, after the sixth-seeded Canadian clinched a 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 win over Alexander Zverev of Germany, the 10th seed.
Raonic defeated Federer in the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 2016. Federer, 35, is the second oldest man to make the quarter-finals at Wimbledon behind Ken Rosewall who was 39 when he reached the last-eight in 1971.
Im thrilled to be back in the quarters again, said Federer who took his record over Dimitrov to 6-0.
Safety issue
The All England Club defended the decision not to switch Djokovic against Mannarino to Centre Court.
It was determined the match could not be moved to Centre Court due to the number of spectators remaining in the grounds, said a statement.
As late as 8:30pm, 30,000 people still remained in the grounds, and therefore moving the match would have created a significant safety issue.
Both players were explained the rationale of postponing the match.
Querrey, the US 24th seed who knocked out Djokovic in 2016, made the quarter-finals for a second successive year with a 5-7, 7-6 (7/5), 6-3, 6-7 (13/11), 6-3 over unseeded Kevin Anderson of South Africa.
Seventh seeded Cilic downed Roberto Bautista Agut of Spain 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.
Cilic will look to reach his first semi-final at the All England Club when he faces Muller.
Czech 11th seed Tomas Berdych downed eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria 6-3, 6-7 (1/7), 6-3, 3-6, 6-3.
Berdych, the 2010 runner-up, will face either three-time champion Djokovic or Mannarino for a place in the semi-finals. AFP

Themed in resonance with World Environment Day, this years focus was on connecting with nature and the programme provided the opportunity for Nations Trust Banks customers and employees to bond with their children in sharing knowledge and learning together about their environment, whilst at the same time facilitating greater awareness regarding the accessibility of urban wetlands such as the biodiversity park in Thalawathugoda.
The event featured, interactive, engaging sessions by leading biodiversity researchers, Anya Ratnayake and Ashan Thudugala on wetlands and their importance and on the fishing cats in Sri Lanka.
The children were thrilled by the video footage captured of the fishing cats through camera traps and CCTV footage in the midst of Colombo and were also bemused by scat samples available for observation.
These presentations were followed by a guided walk in the park, facilitated by biodiversity experts, kids being paired with their parents along the walk. The experts were present to give more details as and when kids and parents spotted different species or placards of such species that were placed to make the walk interesting and fun for the kids.
Volunteers of Nations Trust Bank also joined to help facilitate the nature walk.

New Inland Revenue Act to simplify tax system  Minister
Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera during a discussion with representatives of the trade unions of the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) stated that the main objective of the new Inland Revenue Bill was to simplify the tax system in the country.
This will create an investor friendly environment that will attract more foreign direct investments in the near future. The Minister said that the present tax system in place is complicated and that investors find it difficult to understand. Therefore, he said that the new Inland Revenue Bill will broad-base the tax system and incorporate globally accepted new tax principles to deal with international cross border relations.
Minister Samaraweera met representatives of the trade unions of the Inland Revenue Department at the Ministry of Finance on Monday and held discussions on matters relating to functional activities that come under the purview of the IRD. The Minister invited the employees of the IRD to submit their proposals and to discuss any other issues faced by them. Minister Samaraweera further stated that he was prepared to consider the trade unions concerns to enhance the tax revenue of the Government.
The trade union representatives briefed Minister Samaraweera on certain administrative and technical issues in the department. The representatives cited the lack of local and foreign training opportunities for officers of the Inland Revenue Department and apprised the Minister on issues faced by them with regard to the payment of incentives. They also stressed on the need for a new building for the Head Office of the Department of Inland Revenue.
Although tax revenue has decreased since 2011, the Government has been able to increase national revenue via increased tax collection to reach an all-time high in the recent past due to new policies adopted by the Government.

## Title: No change in Buddhisms status

No change in Buddhisms status
The Constitutional Reform process is very much in the news these days, with the focus centred on the place given to Buddhism. The various rumours circulating to the effect that the new Constitution will essentially be a secular one with no special place for Buddhism have come out of nowhere and have no basis in fact. All other leading religious dignitaries have also said they have absolutely no problem with Buddhism having the foremost place since it is the majority religion in the country.
President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Buddha Sasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe have all reiterated that the foremost place given to Buddhism by the Constitution will not see any change in the upcoming new Constitution. (This clause was included in the 1972 new Republican Constitution).
They gave this reassurance following a statement issued by the three Mahanayake Theras that Sri Lanka does not need a new Constitution at the moment and whatever the outcome, the foremost place accorded to Buddhism should not be changed.
Having noted the concerns expressed by the Most Ven. Mahanayake Theras, Government spokesmen noted that the people have given a mandate to the Government to make Constitutional amendments and/or bring a new Constitution. In fact, they pointed out that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too had made this very same promise in both 2010 and 2014-15 Presidential Elections, even though the Joint Opposition de-facto led by Rajapaksa has now decided to withdraw from the Constitution making process. Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne explained that the Maha Sanghas voice too was represented in the mandate given to the Government in January 2015 and subsequently in August that year.
Constitutional Reform
The most eloquent statement in support of Constitutional Reform was made not by a Government spokesman, but by the JVPs Bimal Ratnayake who lucidly explained that the Government has received a clear mandate from the people for the same. Therefore, the Government must go ahead with the process, he said. This had more credibility in the eyes of the public because the JVP does not see eye to eye with the Government on many other issues. But on this issue, both the Government and the JVP are on the same note which portends well for the new Constitution.
On a related but slightly different note, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said on Saturday he would come up with a new proposal to include provisions in the Constitution that would prohibit Governments from interfering with internal matters of three main Buddhist Chapters.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of the Weli Maluwa at Ruwan Weliseya in Anuradhapura over the weekend. He reminded the audience of how the previous regime interfered with the various functions and pronouncements of the Maha Sangha. He also sought a comprehensive plan for the long-term conservation of Maha Viharaya premises in the Anuradhapura Sacred area. While the Prime Minister did nor refer directly to the controversy over the pin petti (donation boxes) at places of worship, several senior monks including the chief incumbent of the Atamastana (eight sacred places of worship in Anuradhapura), Ven. Pallegama Sirinivasa Thera has cleared the air saying the sealing of donation boxes and auditing was a routine affair and not a new phenomenon as the Opposition claims it to be.
PM 40 years in Parliament
This year marks a personal and political milestone for Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who is also the leader of the United National Party (UNP). He completes 40 years in Parliament this year. (His political career extends a few more years). He was elected to Parliament from the Biyagama seat at the 1977 General Election. President J.R. Jayewardene appointed him as Deputy Foreign Minister and a few months later as Minister of Youth Affairs and Employment, which made him the youngest Cabinet minister at that time. He later became Education Minister. He has the distinction of serving as the Prime Minister on three occasions (1993-1994/2001-2004 and 2015 to date). He faced several challenges to his leadership in the UNP but emerged unscathed and stronger each time. He is one of the prime architects of the present Yahapalana (Good Governance) Government led by President Maithripala Sirisena. The two leaders have a sound understanding and relationship which helps take the Government forward, despite the dissenting views expressed by spokesmen for the two parties (UNP and SLFP) in several instances.
Next week marks the 40th anniversary of an equally significant event in Sri Lankan political history. The UNP won the 1977 General Election held on July 21 by a five-sixth majority (140 seats), reducing the SLFP to just eight seats and making the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) the main Opposition party with 18 seats. The CWC won just one seat. The UNP obtained a total of 3,179,221 valid votes while the SLFP obtained 1,855,331 votes. Since the election was held on the first-past-the-post system, the TULF which got only 421,488 votes got 18 seats and the main opposition.
The architect of this massive victory was the late President J.R. Jayewardene, who became Sri Lankas first executive President the following year. The UNP, which suffered a humiliating setback in 1970, made an amazing turnaround just seven years later, riding on the back of the massive unpopularity of the SLFP-led coalition Government of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
The UNP is planning to hold meetings and awareness programmes islandwide to mark this victory that led to an unprecedented socio-economic revolution in the country, rivalling the 1956 upheaval. The open economy was the biggest change. Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said their mission was to educate a whole generation of youth who had not witnessed this event to learn more about it and to invite them to march forward with the UNP.
Uma Oya project
Uma Oya was the other issue that grabbed the headlines last week. The Government has now decided to go ahead with the project which is 70 percent complete, but with a better compensation formula for affected residents. Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, a member of the ministerial subcommittee appointed by the President to probe the Uma Oya project said it was the first-ever project undertaken by Iranian contractor FARAB and the machinery used in excavating the 18-kilometer tunnel was not suitable for such work. According to the Minister, the Cabinet subcommittee has recommended that excavation work be suspended to obtain modern excavators to minimise the damage caused to the environment and to ground water resources. Norwegian experts will visit Sri Lanka shortly to study the project. However, the Minister said the number of damaged houses has been vastly exaggerated.
The Government will introduce the Super LARC (Land Acquisition and Resettlement Committees) system of compensation to those affected by the Uma Oya Multipurpose Development Project, Minister Amaraweera said. The Minister said the government has recognised a total of 52 houses which are not suitable to live in due to the project and they are being granted compensation. Under the Super LARC system, the affected residents would receive premium compensation. LARCs were introduced in 2013 to decide on compensation for those losing private property for road development, railway development and other development projects. An additional Rs 300 million has also been released to the Badulla District Secretariat to settle compensation claims.
Last week, the Government was also busy contradicting claims by the Opposition and some media rights groups that it was planning to bring tighter controls on the media. This issue has come to the fore after certain news outlets said the Government was planning to introduce an Independent Council for News Media Standards Act draft bill. Gayantha Karunathilake, the previous media minister, has gone on record saying the President, Prime Minister or the Government intends to do anything which penalises, restricts or influences media freedom in any way.
The Minister told the media that one has to consider the factor of raising the standards. The Government does not intend on passing any law by force. It was made clear that these matters should be carried out independently. It was also decided that this should be done in consultation with the public, media organisations and media heads and in a way that we can come to a consensus. Many Ministers and MPs have denied any knowledge of seeing or discussing such a document in any form. They said the Government has no intention whatsoever of penalising journalists. Minister and Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said the era of white vanning and murdering journalists was over in the country. There will be no room for any steps to curb the media, he said.
Meanwhile, the media witnessed one of the most high profile applications for the Right to Information (RTI) last week. For the first time, the Pilots Guild of SriLankan is using the provisions of the Right to Information Act to find out more details about the salaries paid to top officials at SriLankan Airlines, which is facing huge losses. The Government is keen to seek a partner for the ailing airline to revive its fortunes. The Pilots Guild has sought details on the salaries paid to the CEO, Head of Human Resources and the Chief Commercial Officer in addition to details on the Pakistan International Airlines short-lived deal with SriLankan, the cancellation of Airbus A350 orders and the Airbus A320 jet conversion. This is likely to be a litmus test for the use of RTI law in Sri Lanka since SriLankans dealings have often been mired in secrecy. Besides the Pilots Guild, members of the public too have a right to know about these issues.
SAITM issue
With regard to the SAITM issue, last week was more calm than usual. There was some drama on Monday when Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Chief Prof. Carlo Fonseka pleaded with Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) not to launch any strike supposedly in support of him. Earlier, there was speculation that he could be replaced by another health professional who could be having a more favourable view on SAITM. The doctors strike, postponed last week by one week, was to take place today or tomorrow. The GMOA has not officially issued a statement on this matter at the time we went to press.
Dengue, which used to be only a health issue, has now taken on a political significance with the Opposition saying the non-functioning of Local Government Bodies and hence, the problems associated with garbage collection, have aggravated the problem. However, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, who has been tasked with the responsibility of resolving the garbage issue by the President, expressed confidence that the issue could be resolved in a few months the most. As for Local Government Bodies, most political analysts are now pointing to a possible date in November for the LG elections islandwide.
Stay orders issued on disposal of garbage will worsen the crisis with regard to the collection and disposal of waste, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told Parliament. He was responding to JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake who informed him about the stay order issued by the Supreme Court on disposing of garbage at Muturajawela. Stay orders will create more issues especially at a time when diseases such as dengue are spreading, the Prime Minister said.
Meanwhile, a tax will be imposed on abandoned lands in the Western Province which are not cleaned of dengue breeding sites as a measure to curb the massive spread of dengue, says Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya. According to the Chief Minister, a two percent tax for the land value will be imposed on abandoned lands in the Western Province in accordance with the Local Government Ordinance. The taxation policy, Devapriya explained was already present but few people knew of its existence as it had not been enforced in a systematic manner in the past. He explained that a large number of dengue breeding grounds were found in abandoned lands and that the tax could be imposed multiple times if action was not taken to clean up by the relevant owners. The authorities also have the power to acquire the land if the tax is not paid.
This is a step in the right direction. Political will and tougher laws are certainly needed to resolve the dengue crisis.
This column also notes with sorrow the passing of respected senior journalist and political analyst Prabhath Weeraratne, a professional colleague and a classmate of this writer at Ananda College, Colombo. Prabhath had a unique insight to political developments and was a treasure trove of knowledge on a variety of subjects. He moved closely with politicians from all sides but also found the time to report on ordinary mans issues. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers and a large number of politicians, civil society activists, journalists, public servants and readers paid last respects to Prabhath at his Mulleriyawa residence. It will not be easy to fill the journalistic void left by Prabhath, just 48 at the time of his untimely demise.

Open discussion on unexpected creativity
You would most probably have heard the myth about being left-brained or right- brained according to your capabilities and skills. However, we have extraordinary people who challenge this stereotype by being equally creative, sensitive and thoughtful as well as logical, analytical and objective.
For those who know Ajantha Seneviratne, the Chief Marketing Officer of Sri Lankas leading telecommunication provider, SLT, and read his books, the above myth of left and right brain can be questionable. As a prominent corporate figure, leading a team in one of the most competitive industries in the country, Ajantha is a sentimentally analytical writer, a characteristic which one would usually not associate with Engineers in general. His works show his ability to sensitively observe life and illustrate it back as creative literature.
Hatharen Hathara is an open discussion which will be held at the Mahaweli Centre on July 12 at 3 pm, centred round Ajanthas latest four books. The discussion will be led by leading literary critics, Jayantha Chandrasiri, Dr Jayalath Manoratne, Venerable Professor Pathegama Gnanissara Thera, Dhamma Dissanayake, Sumudu Chathurani Jayawardene and Dr Nuwan Nayanajith Kumara.
The first discussion of this kind, titled as Aswennata Peranimithi, based on his first four books, took place in April, 2015. As this event will be covering the latest four books, it is aptly named Hatharen Hathara.
Ajanthas first published book was Mama Avankai, followed by a science fiction Ridi Huya Binda, a short story compilation Duhul Sith and Api Apima, a story based on University life.
His fifth book took a turn on theme, depicting a deep analysis of spirituality titled Sitha, Manasa saha Nomiyena Mama. Continuing on the same theme his next novel Deka Nodutu Peranimithi explored the reality of being ordained into monkhood. His versatility is depicted in his book Akala Prema in which the story follows an office romance. His latest, Rahulayek Upanna brings to light the Buddhas son Rahulas life in a way which has not been attempted before.
I was an avid reader from childhood. Even though my educational and professional choices did not lend me time to write, my love for literature was never curbed, stated Ajantha. It was this intense obsession with reading that made me start writing. Im also a spiritual person. In fact, my first job was to teach at a Dhamma school. All these attributes in my life become themes to explore in my writing, he added.
The event promises to be though enriching and a great opportunity to appreciate a contemporary versatile writer.

Pan Asia Bank Deputy Manager appears before Treasury Bond Commission says he was anxious about job security
Pan Asia Bank Deputy Manager Richards Arun Dias, at the Treasury Bond Commission yesterday, said he envisaged losing his job following a media report regarding the banks involvement in transactions with the Perpetual Treasuries Limited and the EPF on February 27, 2015.
Dias said he was contacted by Dhammika Perera, the chief shareholder of the the bank regarding the concerned matters.
He said the same fear led him to meet Arjun Aloysius on June 30 at his residence.
Dias said two other officers who were in the Cooperate Banking Department and the Margin Trading Department of the bank were recently sacked due to certain decisions they have taken under the instructions of former Chairman of the bank Nimal Perera. It also added to my fear, Dias said.
Dias was replying to a series of questions directed by Arjun Aloysius lawyer Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indratissa yesterday at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Investigating into the Treasury Bond Issue.
Explaining the incidents regarding Dhammika Perera contacting him, Dias said: My former Chairman Nimal Perera had gone to meet our CFO Dhammika Perera. Mister Dhammika Perera had then wanted me to speak with him.
Indratissa PC asked Dias Who is Dhammika Perera to much amusement of those who were present at the hearing. Aloysiuss lawyer said: the only Dhammika Perera that I know of, is one of my colleges practising in Kurunegala.
Dias explained that the Dhammika Perera he was talking about is the famous business tycoon who owns the largest of shares of the Pan Asia Bank.
Dias said that Nimal Perera who had gone to meet Dhammika Perera, made a telephone call to him and later on, handed over the phone to Dhammika Perera. The conversation must have taken place prior to June 30.
Dias said Dhammika Perera spoke to him in Sinhala and asked: Richie, have you (the bank) done anything (regarding the questioned transactions) violating laws. Dias said he replied as, No sir, we have done nothing beyond law.
Dias said that he told Dhammika Perera that my staff or I have not even drunk a cup of tea (Sinhala expression can be interpreted to mean havent taken a penny out in English) from them.
Justice Jayawardena said, that would be until you had a glass of water at Aloysius place when you visited him!, which was followed by laughter from the audience. Dias said he was worried about his job security since the whole bank spoke about the issues relevant to transactions where the bank played an intermediary role to EPF and the Perpetual Treasuries Limited.
Dias said Secretary to the CEO of the bank told him that the CEO is worried about the transactions which tarnish the reputation of the company.
Justice Jayawardena asked if Dias knew why Diass CEO was upset about, to which a clear answer was not given.
Justice Jayawardena asked if Dias knows as to when Dhammika Perera and Nimal Perera fell out. Dias said it would have been in September 2016.
However, Justice Jayawardena said according to information provided on the fell out, it has taken place on March 2017.
Justice Jayawardena asked if the sacking of the earlier mentioned bank officers took place before or after the fall out. What matters is when did they (Dhammika and Nimal Perera) split and when Dias started worrying. I want to find out a reason for Dias fearing for his job, Justice Jayawardena said.
Dias said his colleagues were fired from their jobs in April 2017, which means sacking took place immediately following the split.
Justice Jayawardena asked Dias if the two officers, Kamoor Sourga and Udaya Tudawewatta, were fired due to certain decisions they have taken regarding loan facilities, under the directions of former bank Chairman Nimal Perera. Dias answered in affirmative.
Dias said the banks top management, after inquiring in to the issue regarding the banks intermediary role, extended their full support to him.
Pan Asia Bank lawyer Nihal Fernando PC is to examine the same witness before the commission today.

Pannipitiya private hospital introduces modern treatment
Sri Lankas renowned and frontline private hospital, Pannipitiya Private Hospital has added more modern treatment and medical text services among its already available prolific portfolio of services.
The specialty of Pannipitiya Private Hospital is that all these new medical treatment and tests could be obtained for a very reasonable fee in comparison to other private hospitals in the island.
Under this newest initiative latest blood dialysis treatment has been introduced to patients suffering from kidney disease and the hospital is also equipped with state of the art modern equipment and amenities for the treatment of kidney patients.
Pannipitiya Private Hospital which celebrated its 25th anniversary recently is in the process of further improving its services to patients. Accordingly more modern treatment methods and medical tests and more state of the art equipment have been introduced.

Pinnacle and low points  rival captains express their views
HAMBANTOTA: Rival captains Angelo Mathews and Graeme Cremer expressed their views at the end of the five-match One-Day International series which Zimbabwe won 3-2 for their maiden series triumph in any format against Sri Lanka.
While victorious captain Cremer said the win was the pinnacle of his career, a dejected Mathews described the series defeat as one of the lowest points.
I have been through a lot of good moments since I started playing. Theres been nothing like this. This is the pinnacle of my career. No doubt about that, said Cremer as he and his team soaked in the historic victory at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium in Sooriyawewa here on Monday.
Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer and Sikander Raza are all smiles after they had guided Zimbabwe to their maiden ODI series win against Sri Lanka in the fifth and final match at Hambantota. AFP
A series win in Sri Lanka is tough and to lead the team is a super feeling definitely the highest point in my career. The win is very special just knowing that quality Zimbabwe sides have come here and gone empty-handed makes the series win so special. As a team, the unity we had was special. To lead a team like that to a series win I am really happy, he said.
Cremer said he was not sure why Sri Lanka kept some of their top players away from the series but added, With the team they had on paper it was still a powerful team. We had plans for all those players. Given the way we played, the series would have gone the same way. We were excellent today in all three departments. We collapsed chasing today, but we played today to win the game and the series.
Cremer emphasized the importance of fielding and said, Fielding actually separates teams often. That catch from Musakanda was a turning point in the game. If not for that Sri Lanka could have got to 230 and that would have been a tough total. I thought our fielding was brilliant. Definitely fielding is a positive for us.
Tarisai Musakanda plucked off a blinder of a catch at point to dismiss Akila Dananjaya when he was building up a useful eighth wicket partnership with Asela Gunaratne.
Cremer was all praise for all-rounder Sikander Raza and experienced opener Hamilton Masakadza who played key roles in Zimbabwes win.
Masakadza top scored with an important innings of 73 at the top and Raza whose off-breaks broke the back of the Lankan top order batting followed it up with a useful knock of 27 not out to see Zimbabwe home after an anxious period when they lost seven wickets for 175 chasing 204.
Raza came on this tour after Scotland and Holland out of form. The faith we showed with him by keep selecting him was a confidence booster knowing that that the team backed him, said Cremer. This tour showed how dangerous he can be with bat and ball. He opened the bowling today and was brilliant. We knew Sri Lanka will be thinking that we will go with two pacers, but we decided to go with Raza and he was awesome. It was only pre-planned this morning.
Masakadza is very experienced. His batting is crucial so is his experience. He has been in the team for so long and knows a lot. We are lucky to get his experience. His contributions are massive, he said.
Cremer said the only way Zimbabwe can improve their cricket is for them to get more matches against stronger opposition.
Defeat hard to swallow - Mathews
Sri Lanka captain Mathews described the defeat as a hard one to swallow. Everything went against us from toss to misreading the wicket. No excuses. At the end of the day we were not good enough to beat them. They played better cricket.
We have a Test match with Zimbabwe before taking on India; we need to play the Test match well. This is a very hard defeat to bear. We did some costly mistakes, said Mathews.
I am bitterly disappointed. We didnt play well. Our batting was a flop today although we did well throughout the series. There was some turn for the spinners in the beginning but our eventual score wasnt enough. We have a lot of improvements to make. The Indian series will be even tougher. In a small period we have to fix our problems. As a team we did during training but nothing is working in the middle, he said.
Pressure is on all of us. The more we lose the more pressure we are under. There is no solution for that and the only solution is winning. We try to win games, but we commit too many mistakes. We did well with the bat in the last four games, but this game we were awful. If we could have got to 237 we could have done well.
About his future as captain Mathews said, Still havent thought about. Theres time. Give it a bit more thought. Talk to the selectors. I havent decided on anything yet.
Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe will play a one-off Test at the R Premadasa Stadium starting on Friday.  ST

Presidential powers and Commissions of Inquiry
Sri Lanka has had its fair share of Commissions of Inquiry in the last few decades with one of them being the much spoken of Presidential Commission of Inquiry, investigating into the Treasury Bond issue, which was appointed on February 27, 2017.
A Commission of Inquiry (CoI) is one of many bodies available to the government to inquire into various issues in the interest of the public. A CoI report findings, give advice and make recommendations.
The Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Violations of Human Rights which are alleged to have taken place in Sri Lanka since August 1, 2005 (The Udalagama Commission) appointed on November 13, 2016, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to inquire into the alleged VAT fraud at the Department of Inland Revenue in the process of making VAT refunds during the period October 1, 2002 to August 25, 2004 (Paranagama Commission) appointed on September 25,2007, the Presidential Commission on the Disappeared (The Mahanama Tilakaratne Commission) appointed on September15, 2006, the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) appointed in May 2010, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) appointed in 2015, are some of the commissions of inquiry much spoken about in Sri Lanka in the recent past.
The Social reception towards Commissions of Inquiry in Sri Lanka, besides in foreign countries, has always been a mixed-bag. While some questions the independence of a Commission of Inquiry, some view it as a political tool used by a government to delay or refrain from taking action in a particular matter. However, the Commissions of Inquiry are generally seen in a positive outlook.
A Commission of Inquiry is appointed under the Commission of Inquiry Act, which was first enacted in Sri Lanka on September 8, 1948. The CoI Act has been amended in 1950, 1953, 1955 and 2008.
Powers of a Commission of Inquiry
* Procure and receive all evidence (written or oral) regarding the matter inquired
* Examine all persons whom the commission thinks should be procured or examined as witnesses
* Require the evidence (written or oral) of any witness to be given on oath or affirmation
* Summon any person residing in Sri Lanka to attend any meeting of the commission to give evidence or produce any document or others in his possession, and to examine him as a witness or require him to produce any document or others in his possession
* Admit any evidence (written or oral) notwithstanding any of the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance
* to admit or exclude the public from the inquiry or any part
* to admit or exclude the press from the inquiry or any part
Subsequent to the amendments done to the CoI Act, the Commission has also been vested with powers to obtain certified copies of any proceedings of any case, any document, any other material filed or recorded at any Court of Law or at any tribunal and to require any person to produce any document or material which is in his/her possession or custody. It also has the power to require any person to provide whatever the information which he/she posses, in writing.
A Commission under the Commission of Inquiry Act differs from a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry, which is appointed under the Special Presidential Commissions Inquiry law. The latter is relatively more powerful than the former. Whereas a Commission of Inquiry is a fact finding commission whose findings are not enforceable, a Special Presidential Commission has the power to subject a person found guilty to civic disability. A report, finding, order, determination, ruling or recommendation made by a Special Presidential Commission cannot be questioned in any court or tribunal as well. Section 9 of the Special Presidential Commissions of Inquiry Act explains the special powers it is vested with, which makes it more powerful than a Commission of Inquiry.
Power of the President regarding the Commission of Inquiry
The CoI Act has vested power to the President to appoint a Commission of Inquiry when he/she believes it is necessary to examine or obtain information regarding the administration of a government department, a public/local authority, or about the conduct of any member of the public service. It also gives the power to the President to appoint a Commission to hold an inquiry regarding any matter, in his view, being in the interest of the public safety or welfare.
The President is also authorized by the COI Act to set the terms of the reference for the Commission and appoint members. Usually, a CoI will comprise of one or more members. The President has the authority to add new members to the Commission at his/ her discretion and to alter, amend or revoke the warrant establishing a Commission at anytime. The President can also give directions to the Commissions Secretary without consulting the Commission or its Chairman.
The President is also warranted by the CoI to extend the time period within which a CoI needs to submit a report on the inquired matter, despite the time for the submission of such a report has expired or not.
The CoI Act does not require Commission report or recommendations to be made public. The President has the power to decide if the inquiry or part of the inquiry should be publicized or not.
Role of the Attorney-General
Under the provisions of the COI Act, the Attorney General (AG) can appear before the Commission when an inquiry or investigation is conducted. The AG can place any evidence or any other relevant material before the Commission, which in the AGs opinion is relevant to the conducted investigation. The AG can also examine any witness summoned by the Commission if it is the AGs opinion that the evidence of that particular witness is relevant.
Criticisms and Suggestions
Criticism has been levelled against the Commission of Inquiry saying that there is a lack of credible mechanism to investigate into the cases of human rights violations due to the broad executive powers vested on the President by the CoI Act regarding appointment, finance and follow up of the CoI.
Concerns have also been raised against the President not being obliged to ensure that the report of a CoI is made public.
The role of the Attorney General is also questioned by human rights organizations based on the Commissions of Inquiry investigating the human rights violations and war crimes that took place in Sri Lanka. Criticisms say that there is a conflict of interests from the part of the Attorney-General as a counsel to the Commission and a representative of the government, especially regarding Commissions of Inquiry appointed in Sri Lanka to examine war crimes and human rights violations.
Human rights activists and law reformers demand for the power vested on the President to be amended in order to reflect the independence of a Commission of Inquiry while the importance of making the President obliged to publicize the report of a CoI is also stressed upon.

Minister Senaratne said earlier Prof. Fonseka told him that he will not do anything to harm the 40-year long friendship between them.
The minister expressed these views when he met a group of journalists at the Health Ministry yesterday.
Minister Senaratne also stated that the behaviour of Government Medical Officers Association tarnish the image of the profession. The SAITM started in 2006 but they did not protest against it during that time because of the fear of the previous regime. They never discussed matters with the Health Ministry.
Corrupted people in the previous regime try to portray clean people as corrupt due to the fear of going through a Court process under State Property Act which does not grant bail for suspects.
They speak about an act of corruption connecting the President and an Australian company. The government is in the process of taking action against all corrupt culprits in the previous regime, the minister stated.

Rafi: soul with a soothing balm
Mohamed Rafi, the greatest male playback singer India has ever produced passed away on July 31, 1980, and his 37th death remembrance day falls this month. This year, too, thousands of his fans will pay homage at his grave situated near a lone coconut tree in the Mumbai Muslim cemetery.
He lives in the hearts and minds of millions of his fans throughout the world, and even today a melody of his is on the air, every minute in some corner of the earth. Artistic brilliance of the kind he possessed is extremely rare.
In the 1960s and 1970s, before the development of the local film and song industry, there were thousands of fans in Sri Lanka who enjoyed Hindi films and Hindi songs and Rafis songs were the most popular.
Rafis voice was like a soothing balm to the common man in particular, and he sang for all hearts and his contagious smile spread cheered all round. The thousands of songs he sang encompassed a tremendous range and helped him to reign supreme over others in the field.
Many producers, directors and actors in the Mumbai film industry owe their success to Rafi. His voice synced with every film hero at the time. On numerous occasions, he had provided financial support to film producers. Rafi always gave without thinking of his returns, reveals Laxmikant (of the famous LP Music Directors duo).
He was such a busy professional that he hardly found time to leave Mumbai. When he did, on his return he found a clamouring crowd of producers and directors at his doorstep, seeking his services says senior Music Director, Chitra Gupta.
There have been appeals to the Indian government to honour the singer posthumously with the Bharata Ratna, India highest civilian award.

After months of drama surrounding the name of India cricket teams new head coach, the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC) on Tuesday announced Ravi Shastri as the new head coach of India.
The former India cricketer was interviewed by the CAC on Monday through Skype. The other contenders who were interviewed were Virender Sehwag, Tom Moody, Richard Pybus and Lalchand Rajput.
The post of the coach was vacant after former India captain Anil Kumble resigned after differences with captain Virat Kohli. He was the coach of the Indian team for one year and was asked to continue till Indias tour of West Indies which concluded on Sunday but the former spinner decided to step down after the ICC Champions Trophy 2017.
Shastri has earlier held the position of Team Director in the Indian team after Indias tour of England in 2014 in which India lost the Test series 3-1. But, under him, the team reached the semi-final of 2015 ODI Wolrd Cup and later the semi-final of World T20 2016, which was his last assignment with the team as Team Director.

Renovation of Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line complete in two years

The renovation work of the Polonnaruwa-Batticaloa railway line which has been suspended for many years due to the conflict will be commenced shortly to facilitate an efficient passenger and goods transportation.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that the restoration project will be completed within two years.
Minister De Silva made these remarks during an observation tour in Polonnaruwa Railway station today.
Over 12,000 sleepers are required for the reconstruction of 90 kilometer long railway line between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa and around 10,000 sleepers have already been brought to the site.
Currently, trains run on this line at a very low speed of 60km per hour due to many bridges and over 60 culverts. But, trains can speed over 100 km per hour easily after the renovation reducing the time needed to travel passengers between Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa, said the Minister.
He further said that the encroachment by people on the railway land is a main reason to delay the renovation. Steps will be taken to remove unauthorized occupants according to existing circulars approved by the Cabinet for the eviction of people.
Land surveying and mapping are being conducted currently to acquire lands belonging to the Sri Lanka Railways.

A salute to Prof. Carlo Fonseka
Prof. Carlo Fonseka, no doubt, would be the toast of all right thinking people, especially the sick and the feeble, who were subjected to several ordeals during the past few weeks as a result of the callous conduct by government doctors to resort to strike action over an issue with which they (patients) have no truck with, whatsoever, namely the demand to abolish the SAITM medical faculty. When a group of GMOA members visited him at his residence to request him to stay put in his post as President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council, Prof. Fonseka, one of the most preeminent academics produced by this country, virtually went on bended knees, pleading with the doctors not to go on strike on his behalf and heap hardship on the innocent patients. He made it clear he had served his full term, and more, in the post he had just vacated and wanted the chapter closed.
Clearly, Prof. Fonseka is not keen to be a party to the kind of action that the doctors were contemplating viz to paralyse the country's health sector and endanger the lives of the patients. Moreover, the erudite scholar who had devoted the best part of his life to the cause of medicine would be the last person to encourage those who passed out of his hands to be the instruments of suffering or death. True, Prof. Fonseka too is an ardent advocate against private medical colleges and was vehement in his stand for the abolishment of SAITM. Still, he would not endorse the means resorted to be the doctors to win their demands. His obsequious request to the doctors bears this out.
It is hoped that the GMOA doctors, many of whom, no doubt, had been Prof. Fonseka's pupils would heed his call and desist from plunging the country into a crisis at this juncture when appeals have gone out from Maha Sangha and His Eminence the Cardinal to the doctors to rethink their strike action in the face of the mounting dengue catastrophe. Prof. Fonseka's example, also, hopefully, would act as a shining beacon to the Opposition political parties hell bent on adding fuel to the ongoing crisis as a means of regaining lost power and drive some sense into the medical students who have allowed themselves to be pawns of scheming politicians.
We say this because an ultimatum of sorts has been issued by the GMOA to the government to do away with SAITM and remain in power or continue with the status quo and be driven out of power in the words of the GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Zoysa. The GMOA has also elicited the support of the Joint Opposition, the JVP, the Peratugami Pakshaya and trade unions of the government and private sector, for, what it appears to be, one final putsch to dislodge the government if the SAITM issue is not settled to the satisfaction of the doctors. It is strange indeed to note the GMOA working hand in hand with the JO on the SAITM matter with the full knowledge that the private medical college in Malabe was Mahinda Rajapaksa's baby with JO leader Dinesh Gunawardena, no less, submitting the gazette in parliament for the establishment of SAITM and Rajapaksa granting some 600 million smackers in its initial stages. Except that the GMOA has given up all pretenses of being an apolitical body and does not care anymore if its alliance with Rajapaksa is a public secret or not.
Be that as it may, the threat by the doctors, if it materializes in the coming days, will be another in a series of doctors strikes that is bound to continue in the future as well plunging the health sector into a major crisis with dire consequences to the government. It is therefore incumbent on the Yahapalanaya regime to draw up contingency plans to face up to any eventuality. The current stalemate cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. The GMOA, it appears, is not going to comedown from its hard line stand on SAITM and the government too cannot be seen to be giving in meekly to the doctors demands.
But what is at stake here is the lives of the patients. Certain GMOA spokesmen have also warned that they will even be forced to withdraw from emergency services, as a last resort, though it is moot if this threat will be carried out short of doctors being lynched by the public. Still, the government would have to look for alternative options if it is not to draw the public wrath towards it.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has already spoken of a move to split the GMOA and co-opt the rival faction to function during doctors strikes in the future. This, no doubt, is bound to exacerbate the problem given the massive manpower resources at the GMOA's disposal. It is here that the Minister's plan to entrust the smooth functioning of the health service (and others) to an individual like Sarath Fonseka could be put to the test. Drastic situations call for drastic remedies.

SLC has more important issues to address than player managers
Sri Lankas first ever loss of an One-Day International series to lowly ranked Zimbabwe was another nail in the coffin for the current Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) administration headed by Thilanga Sumathipala. Since they were elected to office on January 3 2016, the countrys cricket has been on the down grade and unless some drastic changes are made we will end up like the West Indies or Zimbabwe.
The only silver lining of the current administration is the 3-0 whitewash that Sri Lanka handed out to the Aussies in August last year, but the dismal performances that has followed the national team since then puts into perspective whether that win was a fluke.
The defeat at the hands of a team like Zimbabwe who are ranked even below Afghanistan brings into question the policies adopted by Sri Lanka Cricket whether they are going the right way forward.
A lot has been spoken of the development plans and strategies they have put in place but nothing seems to have worked as the national team which is the pride of the nation continues to slip, stumble and fall at every stride. The teams current ranking tells a story in itself  7th in Tests, 8th in ODIs and 8th in T20Is. It is the worst record for a national team under any cricket administration in this country.
The defeat against Zimbabwe comes closely on the heels of the last home series against Bangladesh where Sri Lanka lost their first ever Test match to them and managed only a draw in the Test, ODI and T20I series.
To add to the woes of the team they have lost a top coach in Graham Ford prior the Zimbabwe series and are saddled with Nic Pothas who was initially brought in as fielding coach but after Fords departure elevated to the position of interim head coach for the Zimbabwe and upcoming Indian series.
As Ford once said there are no quick fixes to a team in transition and one cannot see Pothas waving a magic wand to make things happen suddenly in Sri Lankas favour during the Indian series.
The series especially the five ODIs is important from Sri Lankas perspective because they are precariously placed in eighth position and cannot afford to go below that slot or they will have to qualify for the next cricket World Cup in 2019.
On current form following the loss to Zimbabwe beating third ranked India who were the finalists at the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy seems an uphill task for Sri Lanka. India are coming to Sri Lanka fresh after a 3-1 win over West Indies in the Caribbean and will be looking to avenge their stunning seven-wicket loss in the Champions Trophy group game.
Sri Lanka Cricket is answerable for the plight of the countrys cricket at present and instead of indulging in some less important issues like player managers they should first try to address the current situation at hand and put the national cricket team on a winning track.
As reported in a Sunday newspaper the player manager issue was first sparked off on social media and it has been blown totally out of proportion. Although SLC cannot turn a blind eye on such accusations like player managers trying to manipulate team selections and so forth and it needs to be investigated whether such accusations are true, the need of the hour is not that, but to get the national team up and running before such issues are addressed.
As we pointed out last week social media has the good, bad and the ugly side of it. Its good - when it informs of what is happening around you, bad - when people try to use it for individual gains and, ugly - when the personal lives of individuals are intruded.
A report on social media states that the Sports Minister has called for a report on private managers hired by national players. Why the Sports Minister should get involved in such issues is quite baffling. When there is a national body for the sport like Sri Lanka Cricket he should leave it for them to initiate an inquiry into it rather than get himself involved in such issues unnecessarily.
The main problem with Sri Lankan sports today is that everyone tries to jump onto the bandwagon and have his or her say and, rather than provide a solution to the problem at hand only aggravate it. That is one reason why we are down in the dumps in sports. When will we ever learn or learn at all

SLIM confers CIM achievers with certificates of excellence
The Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), being the national body for marketing is the longest servicing accredited study centre for CIM studies in Sri Lanka.
SLIM recognised its students who have obtained Distinction passes at the December 2016 CIM exam by presenting certificates of excellence. The event was held at SLIM home in Colombo.
Although SLIM students have obtained CIM world prizes in the past, the highest number of Distinction passes for CIM was obtained by them in the past year. The occasion shed light on an overall view on CIM studies, global context in marketing and the opportunity forindividuals to enter the international marketing arena via the CIM qualification.
Young marketing professionals who seek international recognition and students who wish to pursue a career in marketing can study CIM at SLIM with confidence. SLIM Vice President, Pradeep Edward who is the Director/CEO of GAP Holdings, graced the occasion and stated that CIM qualification gears budding marketers with the skills and knowledge required by the global marketing arena. He said CIM stands tall as the most sought after marketing qualification in the world.
Marketing is essential to any successful organization and is one of the key drivers of any business. The level of superlative excellence achieved by studentsis due tothe dedication and drive of the lecturers, and the institute opening new vistas to rub shoulders withthose of the global marketing arena, he said.
The achievements of the students were mainly due to prowess ofthe highly qualified and resultoriented panel of expert lecturers, who provide an excellent foundation for success and productivity, which are the essential ingredients of quality education, he added.
Senior lecturer, marketing consultant, trainer, tutor and Chairman of the Education Reforms Committee of SLIM, G. S Sylvester outlined the CIM curricula and saidthat SLIM students of CIM achieving this feat is a fine endorsement towards tutoring prowess of SLIM.

Smile from afar
As the most consummate of beings living on mother earth, we have been and owed with a conscience, lingering memories and a heart that beats when out brain tells us the meaning of gratitude and the occasions when we should show our thanks or gratitude.
Gratitude will lose its lustre should we abandon and forsake the persons who brought us to this world. Our beloved parents. Unfortunately, many a parent has been left on pavements and close to places of religious worship to be cared for by our feline and canine friends Yes our friends of the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder too have expressed their gratitude in no mean measure.
Lions paw
A few happenings from history and in the 20th Century. Androcles was a Roman Citizen. He had seen a lion in agony, whilst the former was in the forest. The lions paw had been injured by a spike. Swollen, pus dozing. Androcles had bravely and with lots, empathy removed the spike.
Days go by Androcleles is a simple citizen who is brought to the Coliseum to fifth with a lion for the thrill of the Roman citizens and the Emperor. The lion approaches its prey. Suddenly the lion bows to Androcles licks his face and backs away. It was the lion that Androcles had cared for in the forest. The emperor had freed the lion and Androcles. An immortal moment in history showing that gratitude is also amidst the denizens. Then again, King Dutugemunus elephant Kadol had kept a pebble in its mouth to remember an injustice done to him by one of the very strong warriors. Later, this warrior had shoved the elephant away from a bucketful of Lodiya or molten lead was thrown from a battlement during a battle. A grateful elephant had spat out the pebble. Gratitude once again.
Years back a 14-year-old boy had seen a water monitor by a salvinia infested pond near their home. Amidst shouts from his clerics, the boy had walked up to the animal.
On the throes of death
An empty salmon tin had got stuck in its mouth. Head and eyes were swollen. Seemed to be in great pain. On the throes of death.
Then this boy had very gently removed the tin, caressed its head. After a few minutes, it had slithered back into the pond.
Next morning this young person had walked up to the pond. Others had followed. They had seen a ripple and this grateful four-legged reptile had come up to its saviour and had kept on gazing at him for a few minutes. The boy had been in tears. So had all. Believe it or not, this water monitor which had reduced the poultry in this house had never hurt their poultry, kittens and puppies, thereafter.
A dog had fallen into a pond near the Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharaya. The usual 4.30 am first bus passengers were gazing at the struggling bloated canine moving in the pond. Its final stages. Then one of the onlookers had handed over his office bag to his regular morning bus passenger friends and unheeding the advice of all, about the ferocity of a dying animal, had lifted it, placed it on the pavement, massaged its stomach patted it. It had spurted out lots of water. All had boarded the 4.30 but to Colombo. The following morning the fairytale.
All had been amazed to see the rescued dog run up to its saviour, whined wagged its tail. It had been with the hero till he boarded the bus, next our doggie had also boarded the bus. A wonderful set of empathetic humans had brought him down. This had been a regular happening. Our gentle Buddha must have smiled from His abode in the Shrine Room of the Rajamaha Viharaya.
Evolutionary ladder
They were all acts of gratitude shown by our friends of the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder to man the most consummate.
Mans intelligence makes him show his gratitude in accordance with the favour received. We pray to our celestial teachers in times of need. We make vows. If you help me, I will do this for You policy. A bribe I think that we should pray to them in times of reed. When our prayers have been answered we should show our Gratitude.

South Africa hopes to move closer to semi-finals
With a place in the semi-finals of the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 still its for the taking, South Africa captain Dane Van Niekerk insists team confidence is at an all-time high as it prepares for its next challenge.
That comes in the form of Sri Lanka at the County Ground, Taunton on Wednesday, with Inoka Ranaweeras side still searching for its first win of the tournament.
South Africa, in contrast, has three victories to its name, the latest coming in a 115-run triumph over India on Saturday  a game in which Van Niekerk took four wickets and hit a half-century.
But while South Africas opponent is yet to get its tournament up and running with points on the table, Van Niekerk admits her team is in no doubt of the battle that lies in wait.
The performances Sri Lanka has shown in this tournament have been really good, said the all-rounder. We know how good they are, and were not going to go out there underestimating them.
We are going to go there to play our best cricket, the way we have been playing and our brand, and hopefully that is good enough to get another two points.
Sri Lanka come into its tie with the Proteas on the back of a 47-run defeat by the West Indies at the weekend, and while it has already been confirmed it will be heading home at the conclusion of the pool stage, the team is optimistic it wont leave without a win.
For batter Chamari Atapattu, the team has already pinpointed areas for improvement, and is determined to put practice into play come Wednesday.
South Africa is a good team, they have two or three fast bowlers, but we have played a lot of cricket against them, both home and away, said Atapattu.
We have won a few of those games and I scored a few 50s and hundreds against them. I think we have a chance, and we will do our best.
I think our spinners are good but we are struggling in that area on this tour. I think in the next match, Inoka [Ranaweera], Shashikala [Siriwardena] and Oshadi [Ranasinghe] can do very well.

Sri Lanka Cricket pants controversy
Officals at the Sorriyawewa Cricket stadium had taken measures to ensure that the ball boys stationed around the ground handed over the trousers they were wearing prior to leaving the ground after the recently concluded Sri Lanka vs Zimbabwe cricket series, according to officers at the Sooriyawewa grounds.
Around 100 youth who were recruited as ball boys, whose main duty was to help with the main cover which covers the pitch, had to remove their trousers which were given to them by the ground authorities, and return to their homes in their underwear.
The authorities had instructed them that if they were to receive the nominal payment of 1000 rupees per day for being ball boys they had to return the trousers they were wearing.
The youth had worn the trousers throughout the series.
The sudden instructions had come with no prior warning causing surprise and then embarrassment to them.
Schoolchildren and youth who play cricket in a given locality are usually recruited to be ball boys, being stationed around the boundary line during matches.
Speaking to the Daily News some of those affected by the decision said that they had to wait till nightfall to go to their homes after having handed over their trousers to the ground authorities.
Ground authorities when questioned said that they were following instructions of Sri Lanka Cricket.
However, when contacted spokesman for Sri Lanka Cricket said that the board had not instructed the ground staff. The spokesman said that the decision was entirely that of the ground staff and a press release on the incident would be released shortly.

The first round-table discussion between Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera and representatives of the Inland Revenue Trade Unions Joint Committee to resolve issues pertaining to the new Inland Revenue Bill ended on a positive note on Monday, a Ministry spokesman and TU representatives said.
The Government presented the new Inland Revenue Bill in Parliament on July 5. The Bill, among other things, introduces new income tax structure and aimed at closing loopholes in revenue collection.
However, the Trade Unions have expressed their concerns over the drastic changes proposed to the Inland Revenue Act.
Inland Revenue Trade Unions Joint Committee member Ajith Galhena told the Daily News that Minister Samaraweera acknowledging that the draft Bill contains problematic Clauses, requested the TUs to present their proposals in writing.
He agreed to meet us again to discuss our proposals. We hope to submit our proposals in writing tomorrow, he said.
This Act is incapable of increasing revenue. It has scrapped the powers of our officers.
The TUs have filed two petitions against the new Bill. Our request to get an appointment with former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to explain our concerns were repeatedly rejected.
We are glad that the current minister is willing to discuss, he said. Galhena said the TUs also brought to the attention of the minister that the delay in gazetting Amendments to give legal effect to budgetary proposals of 2016 and 2017 has led to a loss of revenue.

UNDP's Aadhayam 2017 trade fair opens on July 14
Aadhayam 2017, a national trade fair organized by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Sri Lanka will be held at the BMICH, Colombo, from July 14-16 from 10 am  7 pm.
The three-day trade fair will showcase over 200 entrepreneurs, producer groups and organizations from ten selected districts of the country, namely, Ampara, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mannar, Monaragala, Mullativu, Puttalam and Vavuniya.
The primary objective of Aadhayam 2017 is to create a favorable platform for Sri Lankan small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in order to promote them further and enable them to connect with larger markets and expand business partnerships for national and international trade.
These entrepreneurs and producers have been supported by UNDP in collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka, under the Governance for Local Economic Development programme, through projects funded by the Government of Canada, the European Union and the Government of Norway.
Furthermore, UNDP has also partnered with government counterparts at both the local and national level, such as the National Design Centre (NDC), Industrial Technology Institute (ITI) and Industrial Services Bureau (ISB) to ensure the sustainability of these producers.
The aim of UNDP Sri Lanka is to see these SME businesses expand, fostering innovation, employment, skill development and local enterprise.
As SMEs contribute significantly to Sri Lankas Gross Domestic Product, this sector has a lot of potential in promoting the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.
Speaking about this Trade Fair, Lovita Ramguttee, Country Director, UNDP Sri Lanka, said, The 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda is a plan of action for people, planet and prosperity.
As Sri Lanka aspires to become a higher middle income country, we believe that Small and Medium Enterprises and entrepreneurs present an important opportunity to develop the existing potential in the country.
However, its no longer enough to simply enable someone to produce more - we also need to make sure their products are competitive and that they have access to national and international markets so entrepreneurs can sustain their businesses.
It is only through the strong collaboration with the Government of Sri Lanka and the commitment from our development partners that we are able to support the people of Sri Lanka to ensure that we can achieve sustainable development together. From local artisan crafts to traditional spices, palymyrah, coir, batik as well as traditional food items, Aadhayam 2017 will bring together diverse local entrepreneurs to celebrate Sri Lankan industries and promote sustainable development and inclusive growth.

US jobs growth faster than expected
US employment rose by more than expected last month, but wage growth remained subdued, latest figures show.
The economy added 222,000 jobs in June, the US Department of Labor said, and job creation in April and May was higher than previously estimated.
However, despite the job gains and a low 4.4% unemployment rate, wage growth remained tepid.
Average wages rose 2.5% year-on-year, which analysts said was a sign the market still had room to improve. "Once again, the buzz kill on the jobs report is the lack of more substantial wage growth," said Mark Hamrick, a senior economic analyst for Bankrate.com, which tracks interest rates. "This suggests that we've not yet checked off the 'full employment' box, meaning more progress can be extracted from the job market." Vote of confidence
Economists have expected job growth to slow and wages to rise, as more people are employed and firms have a harder time hiring.
Job growth had appeared to decelerate in April and May, but in its latest release the Labor Department revised the job creation estimates to 207,000 in April from 174,000, and to 152,000 in May from 138,000. (BBC)

Venus, Muguruza into Wimbledon semi-finals
LONDON: Venus Williams became the oldest Wimbledon semi-finalist for 23 years as the five-time champion brushed aside French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko, while Garbine Muguruza powered past Svetlana Kuznetsova to make it back to the last four on Tuesday.
Williams 73-minute masterclass on Centre Court clinched a 6-3, 7-5 victory that made her the most senior player to reach the semi-finals since Martina Navratilova in 1994.

World number 11 Williams, beaten in this years Australian Open final, was knocked out in the 2016 semi-finals and is chasing a first major title since winning Wimbledon in 2008.
Williams victory equalled her sister Serenas total of 86 main draw match victories at Wimbledon, the most among any active player.
She will climb back into the top 10 thanks to her Wimbledon run, but breaking Serenas record to become the tournaments oldest champion in the Open era is her sole focus.
Twenty years after making her Wimbledon debut, Venus was playing in her 100th singles match at the All England Club, while Ostapenko was in only her eighth. AFP

Why you need a library card catalog
My dream home contains three very simple and reasonable commodities: lots of floor-to-ceiling bookshelves with a rolling ladder, a comfy window seat for marathon reading sessions, and an antique library card catalog.
Ive been enchanted with card catalogs since I first set eyes on one in my childhood library, but I have to confess that my fascination has nothing to do with books. Or cataloging. I just really, really like tiny drawers. And the idea of filling lots of tiny drawers. When I go furniture shopping and encounter dressers that have rows of tiny drawers that turn out to be a faade for one large drawer, I get unreasonably angry at said dresser. But library card catalogs are not tricksy in that way. They are full of magic and promise. And the connection to libraries and books is cool, too. I guess. But the tiny drawers!
What do you do with a library card catalog So many things, my friends. The possibilities are endless.
They make great statement pieces in your home. The statement of course being I LOVE BOOKS.
You can use them for displaying small collectibles.
Or plants.
Or to just stash all your wine.
Heck, just turn it into a bookish bar if 641.2 is your favorite section of the library.
Theyre very useful in the kitchen.
Or in the bedroom or bathroom for toiletries.
They may not be the most functional pieces for dressers, but you can use them for small articles of clothing and accessories.
Keep track of all of your crafting supplies, no matter your medium!

Words after words
The terms, modern, modernism and modernity, though familiar today in all subject areas linked to arts and culture, the pioneer and his work G S Fraser may not be too familiar. As far back as 1953, George Sunderland Fraser who was a freelance writer on literary topics in the United Kingdom and the United States came to collect all the bits and pieces. Then he, in consultation with some of the literary stalwarts, brought out awareness of the total literary and social scene as something from which the great apparently isolated figures cannot be divorced.
The book had come as a surprise in the Japanese literary scene as far back as the 1950s. Later it came to be used by the university dons of the United Kingdom and the United States. As a result, a methodical arrangement came to be utilised by Fraser, where he segmented his findings.
The part one of the book is termed as the background of ideas.
Creative ideologies
Here he discusses the issues such as modernity and the historical sense as the main theme. He traces the literary evolutions both in the Orient as well as the Occident in order to pinpoint the creative ideologies held from the point of view of Greek poets such as Homer to those of the new English poets such as Eliot and Joyce. Then he proceeds to address issues such as realism, psychology and the various interlinked themes as found in narratives.
From there onwards he comes to explain the literary terms such as complexity, allusions, irony with reference to modern poetry. He traces almost all the major works that had sprung up to the post world war creative works of the major English and American novelists. In order to achieve the goal, he traces the historical evolution of the novel from the 1850s. With this preamble, Fraser emphasises the trends in the poetic creations in Part Three. Some of the new historical findings are enveloped.
One such example is the creation of T S Eliots poetic drama titled as Murder in the Cathedral. This first full-length play was written to be performed in contributing cathedral to commemorate the martyrdom of St Thomas Beckett, who had been murdered there. Fraser says that in spite of its primary religious purpose, the play has considerable purely dramatic power, created via a new form of poetic communication.
This poetic drama, Fraser considers, not only as a turning point in the revival of Occidental theatrical tradition but also a turning point in the creative communication of a powerful religious message to the entire world. In the section on the subject of poetry, Fraser undertakes a special emphasis on such poets as Joyce, Yeats, Eliot, Robert Graves and D H Lawrence and W H Auden.
Practical criticism
The most illuminating findings come in section five, where Fraser discusses the trends of criticism. He triggers off from the Victorian tradition to the critics from Cambridge. Taking into account the initiation of the practical criticism of scholars such as I A Richards and F R Leavis. Fraser considers these two major critics as giving the searchlight to a horde of successions who paved the way for several other literary trends.
Fraser categorically states that with an expert training in psychology and a special interest in languages as an explorable system of communication. It was I A Richards, who, early in the 1920s, became interested in what light a scientific approach could throw on the nature of poetry. According to Fraser, two questions interested him: Firstly what is the relationship to the kinds of statement poetry and secondly the kinds of statement that a scientific student of language believes to be true or possibly true
Secondly, what exactly is the difference not in terms of the poem itself, but in terms of what happens to us when we read it, between a good poem and a bad one His answer to the second question was more speculative than his answer to the first. It rested on the idea of the human psyche as a fairly loose self-balancing system of impulses which seeks to satisfy as many of impulses as possible.
Fraser having preferred the background trends in the critical tradition as laid down by Richards and leaves states that following vital points as well.
Imaginative writers
More broadly, the wider Cambridge critical tradition, of which Dr Leavis is only a part though a very central part has perhaps had a crumbling and discouraging influence on the potential imaginative writers exposed to its impact on youth. Fraser also lays down the backgrounds details pertaining to what is called the new criticism in America, though this owes much more to Richards and Empson than to Leavis, whose attitudes are much too English to bear transplanting easily. Like in many a literary scene seen today, the new creative poets have complained that they feel flattened out by emerging new orthodoxy. As a result, anything creative they do, they feel, is either rejected or placed with a limiting judgement n advance. Most of these sensitive creative areas and the impact on the new forms of criticism are discussed by Fraser in broad perspectives.
The reader may feel that Fraser had been thinking on literary matters beyond his time. Perhaps this is they type of work that deserves new discovery, a starting point with a visit.

SL deficient in family-planning
The subject family-planning is similar to a bomb when it comes to Sri Lanka because various parties interpret it in various ways. But the real meaning of family-planning is not limiting the number of children in a family, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a health seminar held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo, yesterday, he said, since ancient times, rich and educated families in Sri Lanka did not have many children. Ancient Sinhala kings and their ministers had only two or three children. Only poor and illiterate people who were engaged in odd jobs had several children in their families.
UNFPA Representative in Sri Lanka and the Maldives Ritsu Naken said that Sri Lanka has good indicators when it comes to family-planning and stand ahead of other countries in the region such as India and Pakistan. But still, youth in Sri Lanka have relatively low knowledge on reproductive health.
Meanwhile, the consultant doctors who delivered lectures during the seminar said that in 2015, there were 113 maternal deaths in Sri Lanka and 23 percent of them had occurred due to unmet need related to family-planning
. Around 7.3 percent of currently married women had an unmet need for family-planning, which contributes to maternal deaths.
