We shall not sabotage development programmes
People appointed a new government for them to develop the country. They are responsible for all development work and other administrative work.
They are answerable to the people. They must show results. Managing assets of the country is their responsibility.
People do not want government changes every two years. We must allow the present government to implement their plans. Opposition can point out any shortcomings. However, the final decision will be taken by the Cabinet and the Parliament.
Opposition should not try to sabotage the development program of the government.
By this irresponsible behavior of the opposition, it is the people who will suffer. Not the politicians.
There is a UNP-SLFP national government. It is the responsibility of the members of the two parties to get together and develop the country.
If any section of politicians want to form a government, they can do that at the next election.
We should not object to everything the government is trying to do. Even if we are in power we cannot do wanders. We must understand that. We are very clever to criticize. We are not capable of doing something and show results.
Trade unions should not try to dictate terms to government. They should not try to control the government. They must understand how powerful a government is. They have lot of power. Government is not using that power. Do not take the advantage because of that.
Trade Unions are there to fight for their rights, salary, working hours, working conditions, their transfers and promotions.
They should not tell the government how to govern the people or how to develop the country. That is not their function or duty. This is like the saying DONKEY IS TRYIING TO DO DOGS WORK.
We very kindly appeal from the opposition politicians, Trade Unions creating troubles and people who are protesting for unnecessary things please do not try to sabotage the development plans of the government.
If you want to protest, there is a way to do that. Please discuss the problems with the government in a decent way.

The country that doesnt exist
Snaking down the border between Moldova and Ukraine is a landlocked sliver of terrain called Transdniestria. Its home to more than half a million people and run by an independent government. It has its own form of currency, a constitution, and a standing army. The national anthem is, We Sing the Praises of Transdniestria.
But Transdniestriasometimes spelled Transnistriais not recognized by the United Nations. In other words, its not considered a country.
Officially known as the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic (PMR), Transdniestria is technically part of Moldova. But, says Eastern Europe scholar Dennis Deletant, the separatist statelet has had de facto independence since the Moldovan civil war in 1992, which pitted Moldovans against Transdniestrians.
Transdniestria is sometimes referred to as a frozen conflict because, while fighting ceased in the area 25 years ago, no formal peace treaty has ever been drawn. Today the perimeter of Transdniestria is patrolled by about 1,200 Russian peacekeepers, says Deletant, who enforce an uneasy cease-fire.
And though its residents are patriotic, calling themselves Transdniestrians, many pledge allegiance to Russia rather than Moldova.
This national identity crisis was what compelled Belgian photographer Thomas Vanden Driessche to travel to Transdniestria and document life there.
Starting in the capital of Tiraspol, Vanden Driessche spent two weeks driving around the region with a fixer who spoke Russian, one of the territory's main languages (along with Romanian and Ukrainian).
For the most part, says Vanden Driessche, people were comfortable with him taking their portraits. But when he was out on the street with his camera, something struck him about the way people reacted. Instead of being either overly friendly or confrontationalthe two extremes he typically encountersVanden Driessche was met with an unfamiliar indifference. It was strange, he says. Nobody was happy. But nobody was pissed off.

The undergoing repairs of the generator will be finished within the next three days, Power and Energy Ministry Spokesman said.
The power generator in the third stage of the Norochcholai Coal Power Station, which was closed for maintenance for the last nine months, will be added to the national grid from today, he said. He said it will add 300MW to the national grid.
The boiler of the power generator in the first stage of the Norochcholai Coal Power had an air leak and it is now being repaired following its breakdown on Monday. The leak has cost a 300MW loss to the national grid.
The breakdown happened on Monday, but technical team could not reach the boiler for the maintenance due to its high temperature.
Since the power generation under the second stage can also provide a 300MW to the national grid, the CEB will be able to provide power uninterruptedly round the clock, the spokesman said.

Exceptional entrepreneur
Inner Wheeler Mala Weerasekere who needs no introduction was recognized for her outstanding contribution to society when she was awarded the prestigious Margaret Golding Award recently by non other than International Innerwheel President, Oluyemisi Alatise who flew down to Sri Lanka especially for the occasion.
Having being in Inner Wheel for over 50 years, it has given me strength and inspiration and a meaning of togetherness and fulfillment. Our meetings bring joy and laughter and makes us one family of sisters. It takes 100 men to make an encampment  it takes one woman to make a home, said Mrs Weerasekere speaking at the occasion.
Born to a family of great social workers and philanthropists, Mala has inherited all these qualities.
The Great Granddaughter of Mudaliyar Don Carolis Hewavitarne and the Grand Niece of Anagarika Dharmapala [ Don David Hewavitarne], Mala went on to become an astute businesswoman as well as a benevolent philanthropist whose generosity has benefitted thousands .
Mala learnt the fine art of Business Management under her father whilst working at the family firm , Don Carolis. As a result of Mala appealing to then President J. R. Jayawardena, the Parliamentary Complex Order scheduled to be given to Singapore, was instead given to Sri Lankan carpenters, resulting in both our people and the country benefitting. What was more important was what she learnt about the lives of the workforce and her efforts to improve their lot. Together with her husband, they converted Sinha Weerasekeres ancestral home into a safe and secure home for the abandoned girl child, namely the Peter Weerasekere Home [ named after Sinhas father ]. Today it houses 85 children whose ages range from two weeks to 18 years ! Mala herself personally supervises all aspects of the home which includes the food prepared, its nutritional aspect, their education, vocational training, physical and mental wellbeing, etc and ensures they are prepared for the outside world when they leave the home at the age of 18. Even thereafter Foster Mother Mala keeps in touch with the girls to ensure their wellbeing.
Mala is undoubtedly a role model. For those aspiring to a business career, as an entrepreneur, a home maker, a social worker, Mala is that rare person who has embraced all of these accomplishments within herself and carried out all these roles to perfection.
Amongst Malas many achievements are the setting up of a Dialysis Unit for Kurunagalas Civil Hospital along with a 30 bed ward.
Our largest project being Cancer, we set up two mammograms as well as a scanner.
Blessed with four children and eight grandchildren as well three great grand children, Mala is a great believer in the power of women !
I believe women can make it happen. We can recognize, prepare, activate and together navigate. Nothing is impossible. Sukarno said a 1000 men can help win a war. I say give us 10 capable women and we lead the world.

Former world champ Murphy tested by Chinese teen
London: Chinese teenager Yan Bingtao's superb comeback against former world champion Shaun Murphy fell just short on Monday as he lost 10-8 in the first round of this year's World Championships.
The 17-year-old, whose display illustrated the strength in depth in the country's playing resources inspired largely by last year's finalist Ding Junhui, threatened at one point to become the youngest player to win a match at the championships at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield.
The record is held by seven-time champion Stephen Hendry, who was 18 when he beat Willie Thorne in the first round in 1987.
Yan trailed 7-3 and then was one frame away from defeat at the hands of the 34-year-old English cueman at 9-5 down, but the world number 63 rattled off three successive frames. AFP
Despite this ominous run Murphy, the 2005 champion, benefited from the luck he needed with a red to get him over the line in the 19th frame and set up a second-round meeting with compatriot and five-time winner Ronnie O'Sullivan.
"I played well but at 9-5 up he opened his shoulders and I was bang up against it at the end," said Murphy, who had lost twice to Yan in their three previous matches.
"This place does funny things to you and I had a bit of Lady Luck. But I can't praise him enough. He has a bit of swagger about him."
Ding, who lost to Mark Selby last year after becoming the first Asian to reach the final, showed sparkling form in his opening match, firing off three century breaks including the biggest so far of the tournament, 136.
His onslaught knocked the stuffing out of compatriot Zhou Yuelong, who trails 7-2 overnight with Ding looking to finish him off in Tuesday's afternoon session.
Hong Kong veteran and two-time semi-finalist Marco Fu pulled off a stunning comeback in his first-round match by coming from 7-2 down against Belgian Luca Brecel to win 10-9.
In a battle of two English former world champions a brief comeback by Peter Ebdon was extinguished by 2015 champion Stuart Bingham.
The world number three ran out a 10-5 winner over the 2004 world champion, who had to qualify for the tournament this year.

Four sanitary landfills by 2020
Four sanitary landfills are to be constructed in Jaffna, Hikkaduwa, Anuradhapuara and Polonnaruwa, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Waste Management Division Eng. J M U Indrarathne said.
He said landfill technology has been promoted as an integrated solution to the solid waste management in the country. He said the four landfills would be operational by 2020.
The proposed landfills would be the final destination of the waste collected in each of the four districts. Jaffna, Hikkaduwa and Anuradhapura landfills have the capacity to accommodate 50 tons of waste per day while Polonnaruwa landfill can accommodate about 20 tons per day. The life period of all these landfill sites will be over 10 years, he said.
He said the designing and planning have been completed in the four project sites, adding that the tender process would commence shortly. He said the construction of four landfills is funded by Korean Exim Bank with a counterpart funding from the Sri Lankan Government. The total project cost has been estimated at about USD 38 million.
The Sri Lankan Government is responsible for providing logistics, electricity, access roads and security, he said. The countrys first sanitary landfill constructed in Maligawatte, Dompe with technical and financial assistance from Korea was opened towards the end of 2014. Indrarathne said the operations of this landfill site were being conducted successfully.
This landfill can accommodate about 90 tons of waste per day, but we are currently receiving only about 10 tons per day. The waste collected in Dompe area is disposed in this site, he added.

Fine Furniture, the brainchild of Martin Klement, a former structural engineer and his partner Niluka Klement, in a brief period of three and a half years have successfully established a new benchmark for luxury living in Sri Lanka and raised the bar vis a vis customer expectations and service .
At Fine Furniture we promote the concept of investing in long-lasting, quality products with outstanding design, function and performance for a new way of living, said Klement.
Klement who has embarked on an extensive refurbishment of his existing store which once completed will occupy three floors, spread across 15000 square feet; promises his clientele a one stop shop that caters to the changing lifestyles and demands of todays sophisticated consumer, providing an experience hitherto not encountered in Sri Lanka. According to Klement the renovations which are currently ongoing have entailed a considerable investment which he says further underlies his commitment to Sri Lanka and his desire to bring the very best of European lifestyle products to the country.
The renovated and expanded Fine Furniture store which will be ready by June this year will have increased space for showcasing their ever increasing product range, whilst providing greater convenience to shoppers, and promises an unforgettable one stop experience !
Having set up Fine Furniture in August 2013, today, Fine Furniture occupies a niche in the local market, providing specialty solutions with cutting edge European designs for interior spaces.
When we started Fine Furniture a few years ago, it was answering an obvious need for great kitchens, luxury interior products and furniture that represent the lifestyle of the upwardly mobile, modern Sri Lankan and Sri Lanka responded to us exceptionally! Furthermore with the real estate boom which has resulted in several international developers such as Clearpoint Residencies , Destiny , and Shangrila etc, flocking to Sri Lanka, not forgetting local entrepreneurs Blue Mountain and Achilleion, the need for furniture and fittings of an international standard have increased exponentially; hence our decision to expand and upgrade, said Klement.
Speaking of his decision to enter this segment , Klement said that unlike in the past, todays children are demanding and exacting . We ourselves have found that our children are becoming increasingly selective when it comes to matters concerning them, be it their toys, their surroundings, and their lifestyle and we felt it was high time that Fine Furniture catered to this very important segment as well. After all they will be our future customers one day.

Gibran in love
Can love letters be regarded as spiritual writings Perhaps the love letters of the well known poet cum painter Khalil Gibran (1895  1931) written to a contemporary poetess cum journalist May Ziadah (1886  1941) as collected and published by the Gibran specialist Suheil Bushreui, could stand as an exception to the rule. These love letters written by Gibran has been collected by Bushrui to mark the 100th birth anniversary of the poet as entrusted by University of Marylands Khalil Giban Research and Studies Project.
Gibran who lived a short span of life, came to be known to the English readers all over the world through his celebrated prose poetic work named The Prophet. The work came to be translated to more than 25 languages. Born as a Lebanese living in the rural setting, Gibran emigrated to United States, with his mother, half-mother and two sisters. He settled initially in Boston, and later in New York, where he died. Though most of his writings were done to Arabic, he wrote in English as well.
Deep sense of intimacy
Gibran had remained as far as possible an independent creative thinker cum painter. These love letters have been written to May Ziadah, by Gibran as a release from his creative prolific functions. May who had lived in Lebanon as a member of the Womens Emancipation Movement in Cairo, did not have the chance to meeting Gibran at all. Both of them seemed to have exchanged letters to communicate the deep sense of intimacy that surpassed beyond reality.
Bushrui, the collector of these love letters, as written in Arabic and translated by himself, contain material which shows the keen sense of Gibrans poetic vision as drawn from the Lebanese countryside and Arabic cultural traditions of his homeland. Gibran who studied English to enter a wider world of creativity had the chance of reading German philosopher Nietzsche, French symbolic poetry and the English poet-painter William Blake. But it is noted that instead of meeting personally they had the chance of exchanging views about their creative functions via the exchange of literary works and ideas.
As such the love letters as denoted visualize the deep sense of heartfelt expression as noted by Bushrui, the early works of Gibran as written in Arabic contain short narratives which express his ideas. But this was gradually replaced by the parable, the didactic essay, the aphorism, the allegory and the prose epigram all of which became distinctive features of his English works that commence fromt eh writing to the assorted collections titled as The Madman published in 1918.
This was followed by a series of short prose narrative poems as found in The Forerunner, The Prophet, Sand and Foam, Jesus the son of Man, The earth Gods and The Wanderer. Coming on to the love letters of Gibran, the reader has the chance of reading letters from the period between 1914 and 1930, a collectin of 38 letters. Some running to just one single page with reference to some of the early letters which contain material fo spiritual matters.
Most of these letters remind the reader of Gibrans poetic vision of making the humans look deep into ones mind as teachings in meditation.
Rarest kind
The love bond which brought together, these two Lebanese writers living in different parts of the world, was one of the very rarest kind is the main factor as observed by Bushrui. As such, the unpublished love letters of the two form a collection of unparalleled significance for Gibran fans and researchers. Gibrans letters, as we read on assume a sense of creative inspiration, exchange of views, praises and criticisms between two leading figures in arab literary circles of the early 20th century.
May Ziadah had apparently read the pioneer works of Gibran such as the first novella titled as The Broken Wings published in 1912. Writing her first letter, she had praised his narrative style while criticizing the human experience that lay buried, the seemingly lack of sympathy with the heroine named Selma, a married woman who meets her secret lover at a prayer. As she had commented, Gibran had felt that mans only path to self realization lay in love, May was all too conscious of the inescapable position of oriental women,t he grip of social restrictions.
Though May respected the freedom and individuality to which other women aspired she old not disregard the bonds which tied her to her own social structure.
As the intimacies deepen, Gibran tries to express mystic vision. One good example comes from the letter dated December 9, 1924, where the silence is expressed as follows. But how strange the silence of my beloved how strange her silence! This silence is as long as eternity as deep as the dreams of het gods. It is a silence that cannot be translated into any mortal tongue.
He too expresses the sensitivity of some of the cultural traits. One example is from the letter dated January 12, 1925.
The Americans are of all peoples in the world, the most fond of celebrating birthdays and sending and receiving birthday presents. And for a reason that has escaped me, the Americans shower their kindness on me on such occasions. On the 6th of the month, I was embarrassed by their overwhelming kindness and filled with a deep sense of gratitude. But god knows the word I received from you was dearer anymore precious to me than anything and everything others can do for me.
Gibran discussions and interprets his views on poems, paintings, narratives and spiritual guidance despite the fact that the letters remain as love letters in spirit.

Hanwella farming family earns Presidential recognition
Suneetha Rupasinghe and Suneetha Wevita, a dairy farming family from Hanwella, which has been supplying Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka for over eight years, a family-run farm has been recognised by the state.
They received the Best Medium-scale Milk Producer Award in the entire Western Province from President Maithripala Sirisena.
This dairy farming family forms part of the approximately 300,000 small-holder dairy farmers across Sri Lanka that together supply 80 per cent of the countrys milk.
Suneetha Rupasinghe and Suneetha Wevita working in their farm.
Running a farm with nine cows in operation with an average daily yield of 35 litres, the couple started out in 2008 with just one cow producing between six and seven litres each day with one small shed and half an acre of land.
They say they were proud to receive the award from the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation, Land, Animal Production and Health, Fisheries and Agrarian Development something they never could have imagined eight years ago when they began farming.
We have come a long way and receiving this award was one of the most inspirational moments of our lives, a moment we will always treasure.
Managing a farm with nine cows cannot be done alone, and we work together to ensure that our business continues to prosper, said Rupasinghe.
Every day we wake up determined to make our farm even better than it was the day before. Key to this has been working together to perfect our systems, but also to link up with industry experts where we can, said Wevita.
Rupasinghe and Wevita have worked with veterinary surgeons and the Department of Animal Health and Production, as well as with Fonterras dairy experts and Supplier Relationship Officers. The visit and training session at Fonterras demonstration and training farm in Pannala was especially informative and eye opening, said Rupasinghe.
He is one of the more than 3,500 dairy farmers and industry personnel who have visited and received training at the farm in its first year of operation.
The training at the farm provided a lot of knowledge and tools that have helped us to make some changes on our own farm, including upgrading our cattle shed to better suit the unique needs of our herd. In the six months since then, we have already seen an improvement of 13 per cent in our milk yield, as well as a significant savings in time and labour, he said.
This dairy farming family is proud to contribute high quality local milk that is used to manufacture Fonterras Anchor and Anchor Newdale products.
Managing Director of Fonterra Brands Sri Lanka and the Indian Subcontinent Sunil Sethi said that similar to Rupasinghe and Wevita, many dairy farmers have applied lessons from the demonstration and training farm to improve the efficiency and profitability of their own farms, as well as the quality of milk.
Fonterra is a co-operative owned by New Zealand dairy farmers, and we strongly believe in collaboration and sharing the expertise we have built through generations of dairying.
Our Pannala demonstration and training farm is a first-of-its-kind initiative in Sri Lanka, set up to share our world-class dairy farming knowledge with local farmers, enabling them to be active contributors to the industry and the economy, said Sethi.

Here come the robots; your job is at risk
A news item caught my eye last week, that Uber has obtained permission in California to test two driverless cars, with human drivers inside to make corrections in case something goes wrong.
Presumably, if the tests go well, Uber will roll out a fleet of cars without drivers in that state. It is already doing that in other states in America.
In Malaysia, some cars can already do automatic parking. Is it a matter of time before Uber, taxis and personal vehicles will all be smart enough to bring us from A to B without our having to do anything ourselves
But in this application of artificial intelligence, in which machines can have human cognitive functions built into them, what will happen to the taxi drivers The owners of taxis and Uber may make more money but their drivers will most likely lose their jobs.
The driverless car is just one example of the technological revolution taking place that is going to drastically transform the world of work and living.
There is concern that the march of automation tied with digital technology will cause dislocation in many factories and offices, and eventually lead to mass unemployment.
This concern is becoming so pervasive that none other than Bill Gates recently proposed that companies using robots should have to pay taxes on the incomes attributed to the use of robotics, similar to the income tax that employees have to pay.
That proposal has caused an uproar, with mainstream economists like Lawrence Summers, a former United States treasury secretary, condemning it for putting brakes on technological advancement. One of them suggested that the first company to pay taxes for causing automation should be Microsoft.
However, the tax on robots idea is one response to growing fears that the automation revolution will cause uncontrollable disruption and increase the inequalities and job insecurities that have already spurred social and political upheaval in the West, leading to the anti-establishment votes for Brexit and Donald Trump.
Developing countries
Recent studies are showing that deepening use of automation will cause widespread disruption in many sectors and even whole economies. Worse, it is the developing countries that are estimated to lose the most, and this will exacerbate the already great global inequalities.
The risks of job automation to developing countries is estimated to range from 55% to 85%, according to a pioneering study in 2016 by Oxford Universitys Martin School and Citi.
Major emerging economies will be at high risk, including China (77%) and India (69%). The risk for Malaysia is estimated at 65%-70%. The developed OECD countries average risk is only 57 percent.
From the Oxford-Citi report, The future is not what it used to be, one gathers there are at least three reasons why the automation revolution will be particularly disruptive in developing countries.
First, there is premature deindustrialisation taking place as manufacturing is becoming less labour-intensive and many developing countries have reached the peak of their manufacturing jobs.
Second, recent developments in robotics and additive manufacturing will enable and could thus lead to relocation of foreign firms back to their home countries.
Seventy per cent of clients surveyed believe automation and 3D printing developments will encourage international companies to move their manufacturing close to home. China, Asean and Latin America have the most to lose from this relocation.
Thirdly, the impact of automation may be more disruptive for developing countries due to lower levels of consumer demand and limited social safety nets.
The report warns that developing countries may even have to rethink their overall development models as the old ones that were successful in generating growth in the past will not work anymore.
Instead of export-led manufacturing growth, developing countries will need to search for new growth models, said the report.
Service-led growth constitutes one option, but many low-skill services are now becoming equally automatable.
Another series of reports, by McKinsey Global Institute, found that 49% of present work activities can be automated with currently demonstrated technology, and this translates into US$15.8tril in wages and 1.1 billion jobs globally.
About 60% of all occupations could see 30% or more of their activities automated. But more reassuringly, an author of the report, James Manyika, says the changes will take decades.
Which jobs are most susceptible The McKinsey study lists accommodations and food services as the most vulnerable sector in the US, followed by manufacturing and retail business.
In accommodations and food, 73% of activities workers perform can be automated, including preparing, cooking or serving food, cleaning food-preparation areas and collecting dirty dishes.
In manufacturing, 59% of all activities can be automated, including packaging, loading, welding and maintaining equipment.
For retailing, 53% of activities are automatable. They include stock management, maintaining sales records, gathering customer and product information, and accounting.
A technology specialist writer and consultant, Shelly Palmer, has also listed elite white-collar jobs that are at risk from robotic technologies.
New environment
These include middle managers, commodity salespeople, report writers, journalists, authors and announcers, accountants and bookkeepers, and doctors.
Certainly, the technological trend will improve productivity per worker that remains, and increase the profitability of companies that survive.
But there are adverse effects including loss of jobs and incomes for those who are replaced by the new technologies.
What can be done to slow down automation or at least to cope with its adverse effects
The Bill Gates proposal to tax robots is one of the most radical. The tax could slow down the technological changes and the funds generated by the tax could be used to mitigate the social effects.
Other proposals, as expected, include training students and present employees to have the new skills needed to work in the new environment.
Overall, however, there is likely to be a significant net loss of employment, and the potential for social discontent is also going to be large.
As for the developing countries, there will have to be much thinking about the implications of the new technologies for their immediate and long-term economic prospects, and a major rethinking of economic and development strategies.

Issues of yesteryear : Day that N.M. locked horns with the Speaker
Fifty eight years ago, on Feb 13, 1959, House of Representatives of the sixth Parliament assembled at the house to debate on the amended Public Security Bill presented by the Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, who lead the MEP.
Several days before, at a news conference, LSSP Leader Dr. N.M. Perera and the Leader of the opposition in the House has told that there was a big hubbub and large scale objection in the country against the above bill. Almost all trade unions and a number of social organizations had rallied against this cruel piece of legislation. But the then government was in great hurry, and it wanted to finish off the debate and get the bill passed on the very same day it was taken up for debating.
The amended bill was hotly debated at the House. The intensity of the debating took turns from proponents to opponents. It was around 7:00 pm, and the Maturata UNP MP M.D. Banda was on his feet. Prime Minister Bandaranaike intervened and wanted the debating to be wound up immediately. Speaker at the Chair H.S. Ismail, the MP for Puttalam, concurred with the PM.
The LSSP MP for Kotte Robert Gunawardena and his Party Leader Dr N.M. Perera took to their feet almost simultaneously. Gunawardena confined himself back to his seat, leaving his leader to take charge. N.M. quoted from the rules and regulations applicable to parliamentary proceedings, provided examples from debates in the past, and explained that PMs intervention and his intentions contravened established norms. N.M. was vociferous, and other MPs in the house who opposed the bill followed N.M. and pandemonium reigned supreme in the house. He roared and thundered that the government cannot impose its will on the house. The Speaker had no alternative; he was compelled to suspend sitting.
Former late Parliament Speaker H.S. Ismail
On resumption, around 7:15 pm, Colvin R. de Silva, the LSSP, MP for Wellawatte/Galkissa, rose to his feet and raised a point of order. He argued that the Speaker had breached standing orders by re-convening the house, as he has failed to indicate the duration for which the sitting had been suspended at the onset. But speaker ruled against Dr. de Silvas objection and the proceedings were continued.
Around 7:30 pm, police officers entered the parliamentary public gallery and forced the occupants to vacate the chamber. Some objected and arguments erupted. But by force or persuasion, all occupants were made to vacate, and the gallery looked like a cemetery. The Police entered the press gallery and tried to evict the reporters, but the reporters stood their ground and refused to leave. If not for the fearless stand of those reporters, whats being published through this article would not have seen the light of the day.
As the clock struck 8:00 pm, a peon entered the house and started removing the red-ink bottles attached to the tables of the members in the opposition. Who ordered the removal of ink pots Was it the PM who was well aware of the unruly behaviour of the leftists in the opposition, who were once his buddies. Nothing extraordinary or eventful took place, even though some red ink bottles were left behind the tables. Robert, the renown revolutionary, the Kotte Sinhaya, heaved a sigh of relief as nothing harmful took place.
By 8:15 pm, N.M. was on his feet and wanted to speak. The speaker cut him short and cried Order Please. N.M. was unmoved; he continued his errand. PM intervened and proposed that N.M. should be evicted from the house. A proposal was adopted, and the Speaker Ismail ordered the sergeant in arms to evict N.M.. The sergeant approached N.M. and he asked him politely to leave the chamber; N.M. remained unmoved. Speaker was compelled again to suspend sitting. On this occasion, he ensured that duration of the suspension was announced properly. It was for 15 minutes.
Soon after, police officers exhibiting the precision and speed of the Nazi armies when they invaded the French borders during the Second World War, entered the House of Parliament with helmets on heads and battons in their hands. N.M. was their target, and he had to be carried out of the chamber. Dehiowita MP Dr. Colvin, Edmund Samarakkody, Kotte MP Robert Gunawardena, and Moratuwa MP Merril Fernando, hastened to the defense of N.M., surrounding him as protective wall. We wont allow you to remove our leader, they protested with clenched fists. But in spite of their fervent pleas and violent outbursts, the Police prevailed; N.M. was moved forcibly out of Parliament.
Following this incident, LSSP MPs took to disobeying the orders of the Speaker as a habbit, and a number of dramatic episodes in the caliber of Vinoda Samya crept into the parliamentary chambers. Revolutionary slogans like Unnath dhahai, merunath dhahai and Api katadha baya were aired out by the LSSP members. A jovial atmosphere prevailed in the House, and the Government MPs kept their mouth shut and were in a very apprehensive mood in face of the heroic-like behaviour of the LSSP members.
LSSP members continued with their protest campaign and paid no respect to the orders of the Speaker. In the process, Samarakkody met the same fate as that of his leaderhe was forcibly evicted from the house by 8:30 pm. Forcible evictions followed one after another, and almost all LSSP MPs were forcibly evicted. Agalawatta MP Anil Munasinghe met his fate by 8:40 pm; 8:45 pm signalled the expulsion of Badulla MP J.C.T. Kotalawela. Bandarawala MP Y.G. Jayasinghes turn came next, and he was ousted by 9:00 pm, Moratuwa MP Merril Fernando, Negombo MP Dr. Hector Fernando, and Balangoda MP Jothipala, were evicted out of the house in quick succession at 9:10 pm and 0:20 am. Last to be moved out were Dr. Colvin and Panadura MP Leslie Gunawardena.
By 9:35 pm, the procession of forced evictions and bodily removals were completed, and the government benchers had the whole House for them and them alone.
Gunawardena, who remained un-evicted, resorted to some new antics. He jumped on to his chair and began to deliver a speech in loud voice. But he was silenced immediately and was made to march out of the chamber, of course under force and duress. All those tantrums and comical antics of the LSSPers made the Speakers tasks impossible, and he had to suspend sittings again and again.
LSSP MPs for Colombo South and Colombo North, Bernard Soysa and Vivien Gunawardena, respectively, left the House in protest along with the Leader of the Federal Party who was the MP for KKS, S.J.V. Chelvanayagam. UNPers and also Mawanella MP C.R. Beligammana and Dandagamuwa MP I.M.R.A. Iriyagolla joined the protests. By the time woman constables entered the house to evict Gunawardena, she had already left the house.
Gampaha MP S.D. Bandaranaike, Potuwil MP M M Mustapa, and Kalkuda MP A.H. Marcan Maker, remained in the House and participated in the deliberations, but they voted against the Bill when it was taken for voting. The Bill was passed with majority of 47 votes.
Dr. N.M. Perera, who was a veteran politician, counting over 42 years of service as a Member of the State Council and Member of Parliament, had never disobeyed the orders of Speaker, However, he made history on Feb 13, 1959, as the first and only time a MP disobeyed the Speaker.

Kenyans sweep titles at Boston Marathon
Boston: Geoffrey Kirui and Edna Kiplagat led a Kenyan clean sweep at the 121st Boston Marathon on Monday, both timing late bursts to perfection to claim the men's and women's races of the prestigious event.
Kirui, 24, produced a devastating sprint with four miles to go to settle an enthralling tactical battle with American rival Galen Rupp, the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist.
Kirui waved and smiled as he took the tape in a time of 2hr 9min 37sec, with Rupp finishing in second.
It was a masterful performance from the young Kenyan, who made his move with a 4:52 mile at the 22-mile mark that saw him pull clear of Rupp.
Rupp battled desperately to stay in touch but was unable to respond as Kirui kept the pace up to leave the Oregon-based American in second in 2:09:58. Japan's Suguru Osako was third in 2:10:28.
Kirui's time was well outside the world marathon record of 2:02:57 set by Kenya's Dennis Kimetto in Berlin in 2014.
Kirui later revealed he had pulled clear of Rupp after deciding to "test" his own finishing power.
"I saw he (Rupp) was a strong guy. Not easy," Kirui said. "So I tried to push a little bit to test myself. And I saw that he had not come with me, so I pushed a little bit more."
Kirui said he now planned to concentrate on marathon running after failing to find success in track events.
"I tried many times in the track but I see my future in marathon," he said.
In the women's race, Kiplagat conjured a similarly decisive burst over the closing stages to claim the race for the first time.
The 2011 and 2013 world marathon champion took the tape in 2:21:52 after breaking away from the field with around eight miles to go.
Kiplagat, 37, was greeted by her children and family members as she crossed the line.
Rose Chelimo, the Kenyan-born runner who now represents Bahrain, was second in 2:22:51 while Jordan Hasay of the United States was third in 2:23:00.
The Kenyan double came as a welcome boost for the East African superpower of long-distance running. Kenyan athletics was left reeling earlier this month after news that Kenya's 2016 Olympic women's marathon champion Jemima Sumgong had failed a drugs test.
Sumgong's drug test was another black eye for Kenyan distance running. Sumgong's former training partner, the 2014 Chicago and Boston Marathon champion Rita Jeptoo, is serving a four-year ban after also testing positive for EPO.
Kenya was last year admonished by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which accused the country of non-compliance with its anti-doping code.
The Boston Marathon is the world's oldest annual marathon and one of the most prestigious races over the distance on the athletics calendar. AFP

Literary Tourism: UNESCO cities of literature you might want to visit
In 2004 UNESCO started an initiative called Cities of Literature, in order to promote the social, economic and cultural development of cities in both the developed and the developing world.
Basically Book cities, right Were talking cities dedicated to books.
So far, most Cities of Literature are in Europe but the U.S. has one (just one!) magnificent city that has earned the title. Before you scroll down, try to guess which city it is.
To become a City of Literature a city has to , among other things, score highly for:
So lets take a look at some of the magnificent cities that have been Cities of Literature in the past (aka, your travel plans for the next years).
Granada, Spain
Granada is a grand old city in southern Spain. It is draped across the base of the Sierra Nevada mountains and sits there, chilling in the Spanish heat. Oh, it also has the Alhambra, an absolutely breathtaking palace-city, built and ransacked alternatively by Christians and Moors, now standing in grand old fashion over the city.
Reykjavik, Iceland
Weve spoken about Reykjavik before here on Book Riot. Iceland has more books published per capita than any other country in the world (well, the Vatican actual does, but they dont count as a proper country, right), Christmas brings something called a book flood and theres a surprising amount of bookstores for such a small country (total population is 330,000).
Iowa City, U.S.A.
Yup, the only city in the U.S. to be named a City of Literature is Iowa City, Iowa. Home of the Iowa Writers Workshop, whose graduates include John Irving and Flannery OConnor, Iowa City also has a number of literature-themed festivals through the year, including the Iowa City Book Festival in October.

Local talent to be featured at Shangri-la's Hambantota
Mueen Saheed, a contemporary abstract artist from Colombo, had his recent works on display at a special viewing held at Shangri-La's Resort and Spa in Hambantota on April 5th.
The artist showcased over twenty two warm-hued canvases-most of them figurative in nature.
The inaugural commemorative prints conveyed the aura of the surrounding landscape and wildlife in Hambantota. The artist claimed that his works were meant to be viewed as narratives. "This is a special event and I am grateful to Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort and Spa for this opportunity. What you see today reflects an abstract medium of art which is non-verbal and expresses only emotion. Feelings like laughter, fragrance, beauty, deep contemplation, moods, thoughts, heartbeats and my inner soul," Saheed said.
The artist's work will be on display at the resort in the lobby, the Bojunhala restaurant and in a select number of premium rooms.
"We are so glad to showcase the talented work of a Sri Lankan artist at Shangri-La's Hambantota Resort and Spa. Mueen is dedicated to his craft and has truly captured the spirit of Hambantota in these paintings. We are confident that our guests will derive as much pleasure from viewing these special pieces as Mueen did creating them," said Iain McCormack

Manufacturing and retail recovery drove Chinas solid Q1 growth
A recovery in Chinas industrial sector, which accounts for about one-third of the economy, drove Chinas better-than-expected first quarter economic growth as export orders picked up and steel output hit a record.
Data on Tuesday (April 18) from the National Bureau of Statistics showed the industrial sector grew 6.5 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, its fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014. On Monday, China reported first quarter growth of 6.9 per cent, the quickest in six quarters.
Within the industrial sector, manufacturing grew 7.0 per cent compared with the first quarter last year.
Analysts credited growth in exports, in contrast to a contraction in the first three months of 2016, for providing the pick-up in the first quarter.
It looks to us like the acceleration in 1Q 2017 GDP growth came from electronics exports complementing the 4Q 2016 growth drivers, housing and infrastructure investment, Tim Condon, head of Asia research at ING, said in a note.

Massive crowd expected
Large crowds including Buddhist devotees, people of other religious denominations and foreign tourists would visit the Buddha Rashmi National Buddhist Festival 2017, Ven. Dr. Kirinde Assaji Thera of the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya said during a special discussion held on the festival.
The festival is jointly organised by the Hunupitiya Gangaramaya Temple and the Prime Ministers office.
It will include a special Vesak zone covering a large area adjoining the Beira lake in Colombo, the Thera said.
Ven. Assaji Thera said the festival this year will be held for five days from May 10 to 14. The festival is significant because it coincides with the United Nations Vesak Festival held in Sri Lanka with the participation of heads of states and special invitees from a large number of foreign countries.
He said the festival will be held with a strict sense of discipline. Vesak should not be considered as a carnival. The festival is aimed to display the real meaning of Vesak to the people at large, the Thera said.
He said people visiting the festival will have the opportunity to view Vesak lanterns, pandals, Bhakthi geetha recitals, puppetry and noorthi gee recitals.
Children would gain an opportunity to view a large variety of creations. He said the three armed forces, police, Gramarakshaka Brigade and state and private sector institutions were making a great contribution towards the success of the festival.
A large number of media institutions have rallied round to assist the festival and they were thankful the media contribution.
A special word of thanks is due to the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (Lake House) for the support they extend towards the arrangements, he said.

Masters touch
An Evening of Russian Masterpieces will be held on May 2 at the Lionel Wendt Theater at 7.30pm.
Performed by Russian pianist Maxim Puryzhinskiy and Sri Lankas Ananda Dabare and Dushyanthi Perera, this evening promises a rare musical treat to discerning music lovers.
Maxim Puryzhinskiy thrilled audiences, last November, when he gave an exhilarating performance of Rachmaninoffs Piano Concerto No. 2. Maxims technical skills were clearly evident with his powerful but emotive rendition of this beloved concerto. He will commence the evenings program by playing one of Rachmaninoffs most famous compositions - the Prelude in C sharp Minor. He will, thereafter, accompany Ananda Dabare (violin) and Dushyanthi Perera (Cello) in their performances of Tchaikovskys Meditation and Rachmaninoffs Vocalise respectively.
Dushyanthi Perera
Rachmaninoffs Prelude in C sharp minor begins with a forceful three note motif, sometimes called The Bells of Moscow. This piece is described as one of his most masterfully crafted compositions and is matched in popularity only by the Piano Concerto No. 2.
Tchaikovskys Meditation in D Minor was intended to be the slow movement of the Violin Concerto in D but he realized it was too slight for a concerto. Instead he used it as the first movement of a three part work for violin and piano. The Meditation is now performed as an independent work and remains in the repertoire as an impassioned miniature with a lyricism worthy of its distinguished composer.
One of the composers most popular creations, Rachmaninoffs The Vocalise is often heard in a plethora of arrangements of vocal and instrument combinations. The melodic line is however, arguably, enriched and revealed when it is played on a stringed instrument with its original piano support.
The highlight of the evening will be when these three master musicians combine to perform Tchaikovskys Piano Trio in A minor, regarded as one of the greatest pieces for this combination of instruments. Written in tribute to Nikolai Rubinstein, the founder of the Moscow Conservatory and Tchaikovskys professional and personal mentor, this piece is meant to move the listeners and to move them deeply. Many Russians consider this Trio one of Tchaikovskys greatest tragic works. But it is also regarded as a warm and passionate piece filled with Tchaikovskys broad and lovely melodies. Completed in January 1882, Tchaikovsky dedicated the work In Memory of a Great Artist.
This will be the first time that this extremely challenging and complex work will be performed in Sri Lanka. This work is considered harder to play than any of Tchaikovskys concertos and demands virtuoso powers from the soloists, in terms of technique and stamina.
Along with Russias Maxim Puryzhinskiy, Sri Lankas foremost violinist, Ananda Dabare and Sri Lankas foremost Cellist, Dushyanthi Perera will showcase their virtuoso skills as they take on the challenge of performing this masterpiece in the repertoire.
Do not miss out on this unique opportunity to hear these master musicians in concert. Presented by the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, An Evening of Russian Music, is part of the ongoing Earle de Fonseka Trust Chamber Music Concert series.
Tickets and box plan will be available at the Lionel Wendt Theatre from April 20.

Meethotamulla and the Tale of Two Cities
Colombos garbage saga is really a tale of two cities. The affluent neighbourhood in Colombo 7 is cleaned not once but several times a day. At one O clock in the afternoon, street cleaners can be seen assiduously picking up a few stray leaves on Horton place. Environment Police is seen placidly patrolling as there is really nothing much for them to do. On the contrary, in the other City of Colombo ( for example Colombo North ) roads are blocked by wayside eateries and repair shops, garbage is piled up on the roads and slung into canals, open drains are man traps, sewage lines illegally directed to storm water drains raise a stink and ratepayers breathe a sigh of relief if the collection is done once a day.
The Environmental Police, once feared under a former regime for lying in wait for early morning garbage dumpers, is neither visible nor effective. And beyond Colombo is the permanent stinking life devouring hellhole of the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
Man made disaster
The Meethotamulla tragedy like many other recent disasters in Sri Lanka is a man made disaster. Made by man, by mans actions and by mans lapses. Solutions were sought and touted by many over a long period of time but with no action taken, the disaster was allowed to escalate. Warnings of a possible garbage landslide were long given by community members, civil society activists and university professionals . The last silent unheeded warning was given the stray dogs in the area who summarily evacuated the dump before it rained death and garbage on a hapless community, enjoying the National Sinhala and Tamil Aluth Avurudda holiday. The casualty rate is 30 now and yet escalating .The body search continues.
In the enraged public debate following the Avuruddu tragedy, three concerns emerge, constant official buck passing, long-term political apathy and large scale corruption. If as it is true as charged by community leaders that corruption was the real reason that dumping was continued unabated, that viable projects and effective alternate solutions were discarded due to rent seeking, then both bribe givers and bribe seekers now have blood on their hands.
Politicians are castigated by the suffering community as guilty for constantly putting the Meethotamulla issue on the back burner. Officers are seen culpable in that they did not look for solutions and failed to recognise the impending disaster or warn the political leadership in time. Communities from other alternate dumping sites cannot be blamed for their anti dump protests in advance of dumping, having seen and smelled Meethotamulla who would want to have that on your doorstep
Quick to curb protests but problem unresolved
Why is the politicians solution to curb public protests but not to mitigate the problem which led to these protests Why are the state officers and local politicians so unable to read the deep extent suffering of these communities at the correct moment and sound the warning Is Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction (2015-2030) never to be taken seriously by political leadership and officials or continue to be a mere theme for presentations at various seminars Disaster risk reduction needs ongoing sensitivity to the local context.
The people of Meethotamulla had apparently held 15 protests against the continuance of garbage dumping. All these protests did not succeed in stopping the dumping. The state baton charged the protesters of Meetotamulla as it had baton charged the protesters of Rathupaswela. Both problems were left to escalate until there was no solution seen but to take the uncomfortable route of public protest. No one in his/her right mind would want to be holding boards on roads, be tear gassed and drenched by water cannon for demanding a clean environment if there was a sensible, acceptable solution for their problems.
Now the powers that be are in its customary reaction to most disasters, relief and resettlement for the affected, probably the easiest areas in which to find solutions. Long-term solutions for garbage which will escalate in a megapolis are more difficult to identify and implement.
It is clear that change, a radical change is essential in the way we handle our municipal solid waste. Waste minimisation, a ward system which will make a politician more sensitive and more accountable to his/her constituents and officers who can be held responsible for their actions if the country is needed to move with positive lessons out of the Meethotamulla tragedy .
But no change is possible if there is no immediate attempts at through waste separation and waste minimisation, for recycle and reuse, if garbage dumping merely continues to be paid for by the kilo (along with a corruption tag as is being publicly proclaimed by the enraged Meethotamulla victims). All the dumping sites currently being planned as an alternative for Meethotamulla will not suffice if we do not move very fast to separate and minimise waste, mainly plastic waste. The state needs to take several policy decisions, the first being on sirisiri bags. Not to do so, will only export the problem to another hapless community who will tread down the same grim path. It is not that there were no successful solid waste management pilot projects involving behavioural change in communities in the past.
Finding a viable solution
I recollect that the CMC had success in their ADB funded orange bin project, using community policing to curb dumping in the urban watta communities. Compost bins can again be given to those families who have space and want to use them. But, it would be a joke to ask the community to painstakingly do waste separation when, degradable and non degradable waste are collected together and eventually slung in to the same pit.
There are other less visible mini Meethotamullas in the making in Hatton, Nuwara Eliya, Aranayake and Ambuluwawa ( to mention a few recent viewings). Too numerous to count, these dumps proliferate often on river banks and places of great scenic beauty. And this, in a country which is trying to attract tourists!! These garbage dumps in the upper catchment will eventually poison our water sources.
But this is Sri Lanka, we have gone through so much trauma to constitute enough lessons learnt for several generations. This too shall pass away. We will probably move to viewing the next demonstration, the next accident, the next disaster, the next round of political antics with equanimity. But, for those families whose loved ones were buried under the garbage in Meethotamulla, this sorrow shall never pass away .

Meethotamulla calamity : Voices of disquiet hearts
The scene remains grim at Meethotamulla, as countless members of the military crisscross the fallen garbage searching for signs of the missing. Distraught relatives of the disappeared, along with those who were lucky enough to have survived the ordeal unscathed, perch themselves on undamaged buildings, surveying the recovery efforts.
Pools of stagnant water lie in the shadows of smashed, uprooted houses, in which birds and dogs wade. Several CEB employees clamber up damaged utility poles and work to stabilize them. It is a scene of complete disaster. The melancholy mixes with the stench of trash and weighs heavily on the masked relief workers and tearful survivors.
Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne
This is no longer a rescue mission, since more than 72 hours have passed. We are working to find the bodies now, said Brigadier Roshan Seneviratne, one of the army officers overseeing the recovery efforts.
1,060 members of the Tri Forces, along with 500 Police officers, are stationed at Meethotamulla, and many of them are employed combing through the rubble under which several houses are still buried.
According to Seneviratne, the landslide engulfed many houses, pushing them 100 to 150 meters backwards and then burying them. It is the militarys belief that the remaining bodies will be discovered in the area under the debris.
As of yesterday morning, 31 bodies had been recovered. The number of missing, however, remains unknown, as citizens have not come forward to report lost family members. There is little doubt, however, that more bodies will be found, as fifteen excavators, along with fifteen to twenty dump trucks and other heavy machinery, continue to comb through the piles of dirt and trash.
The recovery effort will continue for the foreseeable future, taking place each day from the morning hours until 8:00 at night.
Though the landfill is stable now, according to the National Building Research Organization (NBRO), plans are being made to further reinforce it before the heavy rains that are expected towards the end of the month.
The NBRO is conducting a survey on the site, and we are also discussing how to remove the still water that is building up, said Seneviratne.
The landfill is built on marshland, and much of the water that usually flows through and around the dumpsite is now stuck due to the landslide. Because of this, the military is in the process of cutting several canals through the garbage with the hope of draining the area.
As reported earlier, garbage is no longer being dumped in Meethotamulla, but the military has not started removing any of the waste.
We have not been informed of any plans for shifting the garbage to another site. Right now, we are concentrating on simply excavating the debris under which there are houses, said Seneviratne.
Much of the surrounding area has been declared a danger zone, as several of the houses therein sustained structural damage during the landslide.
About 400 families have been displaced. The total number comes to around 1,700 people. They have either lost their homes in the landslide or live in the 130 houses that have been identified as lying within the danger zone, he added.
Many of the displaced are being housed at Terrence N. de Silva College, Kolonnawa, where much of the aid has been sent.
Water bottles, crackers, and clothing, as well as household items, are stacked here and there, while most of the displaced gather in the shade, some seated in chairs. Relief workers and journalists mill about, speaking to those affected by the tragedy.
Promises abandoned
Kolannawa Raja Maha Vihara Ven. Kotte Visuddhi Thera
I visited the place after the incident occurred. The houses were pulled out from its foundation as well. The residents alleged that CMC sprayed a chemical and it could have led to the collapse.
There have been serious allegations made by the affected community that rescue efforts did not even begin soon after the incident. The residents continuously protested, and the government was very well aware of the danger. But they just allowed this to happen, and the people in Meethotamulla had no choice but to get buried in garbage.
The government could have easily sorted out but they never took an attempt to find a solution.
The Chief Incumbent of the temple made several attempts to find a solution through the government officials, but it was all in vain. The politicians also gave false promises to the people. They never fulfilled any of their promises.
The ministers are very keen on buying new vehicles, so why cannot they find a solution to this peoples problem
They always look for short term solutions and finally people are in trouble. Many broken promises are behind this incident.
Why couldnt the government stop the dumping of garbage in Meethotamulla I think the government should act more responsible and justice should be served to the people.
Lives saved by life lost
Kanthi Kannangara
I was not at home when the incident happened. I was at one of my relatives funeral. One of my neighbours informed me that garbage dump collapsed. We immediately returned home.
I have two daughters who are married. My eldest daughters house was much closer to the dump than my house. When we returned, we saw how the garbage dump had crushed down her house.
If it had not been for the funeral, my daughter and her little kids would have been at home. We lived in fear, but we did not have a place to go.
This is not the first time; it seems the government does not even care about the lives the people living in this area. Residents continuously protested to stop dumping of garbage here, but nobody listened.
Colombo Municipal Council sprayed some chemicals on top of the giant garbage dump and built small canals despite objections raised by residents. I think the spraying of chemicals would have led to the fall of garbage. A similar incident happened previously as well.
I have been living in this area since the 70s, and now the government authorities have declared that my house is in the danger zone.
Where can I go Now my daughter also has lost her whole house, and it has been totally buried.
Even after killing more than 30 lives, the government still turns a blind eye towards the issue.
Lingering bitterness
J.A. Dhayawathi
Several people here are taking medication because of the terrible shock. One of my neighbors cannot hear properly after she witnessed the incident.
All the displaced people are put in Kollannawa School. I dont know for how long we'll have to stay like this.
Some people said that the government is looking for some other places to send us. I wonder where they are going to send us. We suffered a lot due to this problem.
The walls have been cracked and we know that it is very dangerous for us to stay any longer in those houses. That was my native land and suddenly they asked me leave.
The departed and the displaced
Inaya Begum
Many people died in their houses when the dump collapsed, while several others are struck in this place not knowing what will happen next.
It was after our settlements that CMC started dumping garbage. Now they want us to leave the houses and go.
Failed succor
S.H. Harishchandra
I have been living in this house for the past eight years. When we came here, the garbage dump was not this big and people said that it was just a temporary solution by the government. However, within last few years, the dump got bigger than we expected.
I happened to hear that the government has decided to give compensation to the people. This issue is not new to the government; the residents have continuously complained about this. They could have put an end to this problem a long time back, but they failed to do so.
I have no idea how the government is going to carry out their measures to give compensation to the people. How can we believe them
Foreseen fate
Fathima Farzana
I ran out of the house when I heard a huge noise like water rushing down the mountain. I was shocked to see the houses buried under the garbage. We were aware that this would happen someday; the government just let it happen.
I have been living on rent in Meethotamulla. I have two school-going children. I live on the other side of the dump, but my house is also under the danger zone now.
Nobody can use their wells after the collapse, it has been polluted. The army also warned that there is an electric post and that might fall anytime. We have nowhere to go.

Million solar powered houses by 2020
Sri Lanka is looking at a target of one million houses to be installed with solar energy by 2020, said Chairman, Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority (SLSEA) Keerthi Wickramaratne. Currently there are only around 12,000 houses using solar energy and those too mainly in the Western Province.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said that currently the government is offering easy payment terms for households to install solar energy to their house roof tops. In addition the Ceylon Electricity Board is giving a buy back guarantee of solar generated from houses at Rs. 20 per unit for seven years and thereafter Rs. 15.50 per unit for 20 years, guaranteeing a return on investment as well.
He said that under this system a house which pays an average monthly bill of Rs. 7,000 would only have to pay less than Rs 200 as tier revised monthly electricity bill. Wickramaratne explained that today Sri Lanka which generated 60% of power via hydro is now doing only 10% and buying over 60% of power generated by diesel from private operators spending billions of rupees. In addition they (diesel operators) burn 750 tons of carbon monoxide, to produce one megawatt hour of electricity.
Today 35% of power is being generated from coal and wind power while only 3% of solar is being produced. The government buys a unit of thermal power from private operators at Rs 40 and sells it to houses at Rs 18.
He said that the Minister of Power and Energy has identified this issue and this is why a series of concessions were provided to the private sector to build more solar power plants and also to buy solar power from them at Rs 22 per unit. Today we see this working as several private operators like LOLC, Laugfs, are using the Hambantota solar energy park to produce solar energy. The government also maintains a 10 MW solar energy park at Welikanda. Wickramaratne said that globally too solar is being rapidly used even in the Gulf where there is almost free supply of diesel. By installing more solar power panels to households it would also contribute towards helping to lower a huge financial burden of the government and help to narrow the budget deficit as well.
Asked to comment on the support they received from the Electricity Board he said that this is still a gray area. There seem to be several hidden forces that are stalling the rapid progress of the adoption to solar, citing several unaccepted technical points.
He said to overcome this they are looking at a modern German technology where the solar power generated from houses could be stored in a hybrid battery where the house becomes self-sufficient from solar.

Govt. institutions to convert to solar energy by 2019
The government has taken a decision to install solar energy in state institutions within two years. After 2019 all government buildings would be powered by solar energy, Wickramaratne said.
Currently over 20% of the power consumption is being used by government officers. He said that this would bring about a saving of over Rs one billion each month to the government.
He also said that the government is looking at installing solar powered roofing to houses as a part of the rural electrification process. Then Sri Lanka can achieve the 100% electricity status for all targets sooner than expected.

Minute memorabilia
Tourists roaming in Sri Lanka will find something interestingly common: temples. The temple is a keyword in Sri Lankan tourism thanks to its spiritual elegance, calm environment, eye-pleasing murals and many more.
Mural paintings in most temples have deteriorated over time. Take a while to notice the fading of colours, brittleness, and weakening of the paintings  a hallmark of a rich history in this land. Many tourists, both local and foreign, take an extra trouble to capture these diminishing murals by ultra-sophisticated Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera  sometimes even in instances where photography is not allowed whatsoever.
Photographing the murals is a childs play today with all that sophisticated gadgetry. That was not so a few decades back. Gamini Jayasinghe took up the mission of photographing the diminishing murals, about five decades (not five years) back when digital was not even heard of.
Those photographs have been printed in three volumes. That was a few years ago, and now Jayasinghe resurfaces with an exhibition on June 3. The exhibition will last four days showcasing the photographs that Jayasinghe has captured since 1960s.
Gamini Jayasinghe.

In recognition of the national services rendered by Gamini Jayasinghe in photo-documenting the murals of hundreds of temples, depositing them in the Department of National Archives and completing a series of volumes on wall paintings, he was awarded the Annual National Award by the Sarvodaya Trust Fund at the National Awards Ceremony in 2006 for the Advancement of Humanity Development and Peace.
I was initially a freelance photo-journalist and a photo-documentarist. Then I started my career in 1958 as a Film Editor in the Government Film Unit and later joined the National Film Corporation as Manager/Foreign Productions. My abiding interest in documenting rare and precious temple paintings began in 1965 and since then I hardly thought of a separate subject area, Jayasinghe notes.
His work has been exhibited many a times in both Sri Lanka and overseas. Jayasinghe also collaborated with Prof Senaka Bandaranayake in producing the book The Rock and Wall Paintings of Sri Lanka. He offered a photographic interpretation on the life of the Buddha for Venerable Narada Maha Theras The Buddha and His Teachings. Yet another book titled Vision of the Buddha was also decorated with Gamini Jayasinghes photographs.
Photography is a subject area with a wide variety of sub-divisions. Photographing temple paintings seems to be the least interesting subject for modern photographers. Speaking of Gamini Jayasinghe, however, the photographing of Sri Lankan Buddhist art at every location and every period has been his labour of love. A widely acknowledged specialty and expertise in the field is among the rewards he treasures.
During my school times, or even prior to that, I took a liking to photography. I had an inexpensive camera. Late Prematilaka Sakalasuriya inspired me for photographing temple paintings. My first photograph, taken at Ranwella Vihara, Kataluwa, adorned the cover of the Orientations magazine. Thats where I have literally started photo-documentation career.
The task has been time-consuming, strenuous and, above all, demanding.
Even now Im quite sad to recall the pathetic plight of these temples. Many paintings of the temples are ruined because of the dilapidated roofs. There was a heavy rain, I remember, when we were photographing at Subadrarama Vihara, Balapitiya. I just could not believe my eyes, the entire temple was flooded with water.
The roof was leaking heavily and most of the paintings are obviously damaged. We were at Kumara Maha Vihara, Kumarakanda. It was also the same paintings I photographed in 1982, reduced to fractions now. This pathetic situation is there in most of the temples in the South. The deterioration is taking place so rapidly in these temples, Jayasinghe recalls.
His description is sombre and serious. As an expert in the industry, Jayasinghe should have a solution as well.
I planned to include the paintings of 30 to 40 temples in this volume, but unfortunately I could not do so, since the paintings have disappeared from the walls. In addition to these three volumes, I have compiled another series of books on individual temples. Dambulla Raja Maha Vihara, Bellanvila Raja Maha Vihara and Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara are already released. The advantage of this series is that more details of each temple are featured, Jayasinghe elaborates his mission.
Gamini Jayasinghe was never to give up his manual camera. His reasoning is simple: he has nothing to do with digital camera. Jayasinghe believes that you should use a manual camera to capture the diminishing colours.
Modern photography has evolved fast, Jayasinghe notes, and there are people who like to do fashion photography.
My area, photographing temple paintings, is an area most photographers may not like. You got to live under harsh conditions. You have to practically live in temples if you are to photograph temple paintings,
Temple murals will gradually be a thing of the past as digitalism invades every sphere possible. Exactly why Gamini Jayasinghes collection counts to be minute memorabilia.

A misdirected boo
Much play was given by sections of the media to the incident where Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka was booed by angry mobs when he visited the scene of the Meetotamulla tragedy. Certain Television channels went out of their way to focus on this matter as if the collapse of the garbage mountain were all Minister Ratnayakas fault. Of course emotions ran high in the aftermath of the tragedy and the air was charged with high tension when the Minister accompanied by the Police and Army chiefs visited the scene.
It is not just Ratnayaka. All politicians, including Minister Fowzie and MP Marikkar, who visited the scene, were at the receiving end of the peoples anger. These politicians of course have their vote base in Colombo. But not Minister Ratnayaka, and thus, he had the least necessity of visiting the scene. It is natural that the wrath of the victims were directed at the politicians to whom the public have entrusted their safety and well being. It is unfortunate, though, that Minister Ratnayaka had to bear the brunt of the seething anger of the Meetotamulla victims. As the Minister dealing with the subject of Law and Order Ratnayaka need not have stuck his neck out and venture out into the Lions Den, so to speak, when the responsibility lay elsewhere. If he decided to do so it would have been out of sheer concern for the plight of the people and to also ensure that there was no breach of the law and order, as often happens following such incidents.
Besides, the Ministers visit cannot be an exercise in becoming popular. He had no political stake in visiting the scene of the tragedy, with Meetotamulla, situated in the Kolonnawa electorate, far removed from Deniyaya, in the deep south, the Ministers home base. His visit certainly was not with an eye on the vote, or the manapey, unlike a certain politician, who, during a flood, close to election day, distributed lunch packets with his name and manapey number prominently displayed on the buth packet. Minister Ratnayaka should therefore be commended for braving the odds and visiting the victims while those who are culpable were nowhere near the scene.
Those media institutions who went to town about the Minister being booed failed to record the No Show by any of the members of the Joint Opposition save Dinesh Gunawardena. One would have expected the political savvy Mahinda Rajapaksa to be the first on the scene at such instances, as the public knows only too well. Conspicuous also by their absence were JO stalwarts Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, champions of the down trodden and with their vote base in the Colombo district. Perhaps they are only too well aware that the Meetotamulla garbage mountain was not the creation of Yahapalanaya but was in existence for nearly two decades and that they too would have been at the receiving end of the angry mobs for gross neglect on their part. What was former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who received much accolades for beautifying the Colombo city, doing, permitting this massive eyesore to remain without using the considerable resources at his disposal, including the army, to get rid of it
Be that as it may, it behoves all parties to set aside all political differences and unite in this dark hour to alleviate the sufferings of the Meetotamulla vicitms. The blame game should stop and work started immediately to find a solution to the ever worsening garbage problem. With the Meetotamulla incident there is now bound to be stiff resistance by the public to shift garbage to other areas as was witnessed recently in Ja-ela. What is needed is a long term solution, such as recycling of the garbage for power generation, a project that was often bandied about by successive governments to no avail. It is hoped that the Japanese technical team due to arrive in the country in the aftermath of the Meetotamulla tragedy would offer a permanent solution to the garbage problem. The way things stand the problem could only get further aggravated with rapid urbanization and the resultant congestion (there is a daily floating population of nearly one million in the Colombo city). Presently, local government bodies in many areas such as Wattala and Ja-ela which are highly urbanized and populous have run out of land areas to dump garbage, with the result that mini garbage mountains are seen piled up on roadsides. The problem could also invite disease and pestilence. Adding to the woes is the decision by the UDA not to permit its lands for garbage dumping.
President Maithripala Sirisena, as the Minister of Environment should take the lead and get things moving -and moving fast- before the problem gets out of hand and the country being reduced to one big stinking mess. Funds should not be made an obstacle towards a long term solution to the garbage problem. Japan has already promised help. There will be others too who could be persuaded to provide their inputs.

National Cyber Security Operations Centre: Singapore Technologies Electronics wins contract to consult

Singapore Technologies Electronics has won a contract with Sri Lanka's Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) to provide consultancy services for the implementation of the country's first National Cyber Security Operations Centre (SOC), the Straits Times reported.
In addition to the design and implementation strategy for the National SOC, ST Electronics will provide training and conduct awareness programmes to strengthen the cyber readiness of Sri Lanka's digital team and its other key partners, the Singapore firm said on Wednesday (April 19).
"This marks a major milestone for our cyber security global business as we continue to expand our footprint overseas," said company president Ravinder Singh.
"Having built four major Cyber SOCs for customers including government and commercial organisations, we are well-equipped with the deep domain knowledge and extensive experience to protect critical information infrastructures.
ICTA began operations to begin Sri Lankas first National Securities Operation Centre in the wake of a comment by Air Force Commander Air Vice Marshal Gagan Bulathsinhala in 2015, who said wars would be fought on the cyber front in the future.

Netflix says opportunity 'gigantic' despite slowing growth
Netflix has grown slower than it expected in the first three months of the year, but insists that the opportunity for growth is "gigantic".
The streaming firm added 4.95 million new subscribers in the quarter, fewer than the 5.2 million it had forecast.
In the US, the firm added a third fewer new members than the same period a year ago, while overseas members fell 22%.
Netflix blamed the drop partly on shifting some of its popular shows to the second quarter of the year.
The firm said its House of Cards series, which last year debuted in the first quarter but for this year has been pushed into the second quarter, was the main reason for the lower-than-expected subscriber growth.
Netflix said it still expected to add 8.15 million new members in total for the first half of the year, just below the 8.42 it added in the first half of last year.
By this weekend, the firm said it expected to reach 100 million subscribers globally.
"It's a good start," said chief executive Reed Hastings.
He said that the growth of the global internet meant the opportunity for the firm was still "gigantic", and said the firm planned to continue investing in films and shows aimed at increasing its membership.
"We have come to see these quarterly variances as mostly noise in the long-term growth trend and adoption of internet TV," he added.
As ever, Wall Street is obsessed with user growth above almost any other metric a technology company can offer.
Netflix didn't add as many new users in the last quarter as investors had been expecting, both in the US and internationally.
Aggressive marketing is still a huge part of Netflix's expenditure - $1bn expected this year - so it shows those new subscribers really aren't coming easy.
But I think things will likely improve this year with the roll out of the new seasons of House of Cards and Stranger Things, both blockbuster shows that represent the very best of their "Originals" brand.
The firm increased revenues by over a third to $2.64bn for the quarter compared to the first three months of last year, while net income rose to $178m from $28m.
Its shares fell in after-hours trading, dropping 3% with investors disappointed by the slower-than-expected growth.
Netflix said it would continue to focus on original programming, aiming to "please diverse tastes with a wide breadth of content".
The company started making its own shows in 2013, with House of Cards one of its first big hits and Stranger Things more recently. Netflix plans to spend more on original content this year and reduce outlays on licensed material such as movies.

Non-oil exports see fifth month of growth
Non-oil domestic exports (Nodx) climbed for a fifth straight month, up 16.5 per cent in March from the same period a year ago.
Last months Nodx was 1.1 per cent lower than Februarys, but this still beat economists forecast of a much sharper 6.4 per cent fall.
Last weeks preliminary gross domestic product (GDP) numbers hinted as much, as Singapores economy grew 2.5 per cent in the first quarter, led by export-dependent sectors. Both electronic and non-electronic Nodx put in a strong showing in March. Electronic exports rose 5.2 per cent last month from the same period a year earlier, while non- electronic shipments jumped 20.8 per cent. Petrochemical exports surged 42.8 per cent year on year, while pharmaceuticals rebounded 17.7 per cent, after contracting 4.4 per cent in February from the same period a year earlier.
Exports to all the top 10 Nodx markets also rose again in March, led by China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, noted OCBC Banks head of treasury research and strategy, Ms Selena Ling. She said this suggested that the growth momentum in the Greater China economies had picked up.
Taking into account the March data, first-quarter Nodx is up 15.4 per cent overall, which puts Singapore in a good position for the rest of the year, she added.
Even if you assume a significant slowdown in the next three quarters, we could still see Nodx up around 2 per cent for the full year, although of course we do have to see what happens in the rest of the year.
ANZ economist Ng Weiwen was also upbeat, saying: The trade recession is behind us.
Chinas GDP figures, also out yesterday, showed the worlds second-largest economy growing at a strong clip in the first quarter, he noted. China Business News

Part of Colombo garbage to Karadiyana
The Kesbewa Magistrates Court yesterday permitted the disposal of garbage collected in the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) area to Karadiyana in Piliyandala until April 28. Municipal Commissioner V K Anura speaking to the Daily News yesterday said a part of the garbage collected in the CMC would be dumped at Karadiyana while the remainder would be sent to several other waste dumping sites. The Commissioner however, declined to name the other sites stating that revealing them may trigger public protests.
The Kesbewa Magistrates Court in May last year imposed a ban on the CMC to dump garbage collected in the municipality in Karadiyana following a motion filed by three petitioners. Upon a request made by the CMC in the wake of Meethotamulla tragedy, the Magistrate temporarily lifted the ban and allowed disposal of about half the collected garbage daily to Karadiyana temporarily.
The CMC commenced dumping garbage in Karadiyana yesterday. As reported, Police protection has also been provided to the site. The CMC collects about 800 tons of garbage daily. We need the support of all for the onerous task of managing the Colombos garbage, because this garbage is not generated only by the people residing in Colombo. A large number of people in the offices , hospitals and schools in Colombo come from outstation areas.
If we are to deal only with garbage generated by the residents in Colombo, then it is a matter of about 100-150 tons, he said.

Patients issued erroneous prescriptions
A survey carried out in Aluthgama and Kandy show that 37 percent of prescriptions given by physicians to their patients have non-standard abbreviations, Specialist Physician, Professor in Pharmacology and Head of the Department of Pharmacology and Pharmacy of Medicine Faculty of the Colombo University Priyadarshani Galappatthy said.
Another study on 1,000 prescriptions issued from the private sector hospitals in the North Central Province showed that 26 percent of the prescriptions issued were legible while 65 percent can be hardly understood while 9 percent were illegible.
Some drugs on 53 percent prescriptions may have potential harmful interaction. Incomplete, absence or incorrect route, dose, frequency and duration details were found in most of the prescriptions.
Unapproved and error prone abbreviations were seen in about 70 percent of prescriptions. The Department of Pharmacology, Colombo after studying over 500 prescription, found errors in drug dose (35 percent), drug name (28 percent) and frequency (19 percent) of administration, Galappatthy said.
When prescribing Paracetamol for children, the most commonly done errors such as incorrect dose amount were reported, Galappatthy said.
When prescribing phonetically similar drugs, many errors are done. Most such errors (about 64.2 percent) caused minor effects, but a few (3.4 percent) could cause severe health problems, the surveys highlight.

Pence reassures Japan as North Korea threatens weekly tests
JAPAN: US Vice President Mike Pence reiterated his countrys commitment to the security of Japan on Tuesday, as North Korea intensified concerns over its weapons programme with a vow to launch missile tests every week. The North, which is intent on developing a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United States, defied international pressure Sunday with a test that failed immediately after launch.
As fears grow that it may also be preparing for its sixth nuclear weapons test, Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-Ryol said that its programme would only escalate.
Well be conducting more missile tests on a weekly, monthly and yearly basis, Han told the BBC in an interview, threatening all-out war if the US took any action against it.
Arriving in Tokyo for talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Pence hailed the two countries longstanding security ties.
The alliance between the United States and Japan is the cornerstone of peace and security in Northeast Asia, he told Abe.
The Japanese leader called for a peaceful resolution to the North Korea tensions but did not rule out the need for tough measures.
It is a matter of paramount importance for us to seek diplomatic efforts as well as peaceable settlements of the issue, he said.
At the same time dialogue for the sake of dialogue is valueless and it is necessary for us to exercise pressure.
In South Korea on the first leg of an Asian tour, Pence on Monday visited the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone separating the two Koreas and warned Pyongyang against further provocations, saying all options are on the table.
North Korea could react to a potential US strike by targeting South Korea or Japan, and officials in both countries have been ill at ease with the more bellicose language deployed by President Donald Trumps administration.
Pence pointed to Trumps recent strikes on a Syrian airbase and an Islamic State complex in Afghanistan as a warning to Pyongyang not to underestimate the administrations resolve.
Throughout his bareknuckle election campaign, Trump repeatedly called into question a mutual defence treaty between Japan and the United States, suggesting Tokyo should pay for its own security.
But now, Pence will try to reassure his jittery hosts that those decades-old security commitments are ironclad, a necessity made more acute after Washingtons refusal to rule out military action against the regime.
Tensions between Pyongyang and Washington have soared in recent weeks as a series of North Korean missile tests have prompted ever-more severe warnings from Trumps administration. - AFP

Pentagon to test ability to shoot down North Korean missiles

The Pentagon will conduct two major high-stakes tests in May of its ability to shoot down missiles launched out of North Korea.
The long-scheduled tests in the Pacific are part of the US military's overall ballistic missile defense program to defend against North Korean or Iranian threats -- but are, for now at least, aimed at ensuring the US can defend against a threat from North Korea, US defense officials said.
One of the actions will involve test-firing an improved Standard Missile off a Navy ship, a defense official said. The tests are taking place over the Pacific because that's where the test ranges are large enough to accommodate them.
The upgraded missile has only been tested once before. The new version has an improved booster and warhead. That means the missile could fire at longer ranges, presumably farther from the North Korean coastline, and have a greater chance of hitting the threatening incoming missile.
The program has been in development with Japan and is aimed at shooting down intermediate-range North Korean missiles that pose a threat to the US ally.
A separate critical test in the Pacific region, to be held at the end of May, will examine the ability of the US to shoot down a future North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile that could threaten the US.
That test involves long-range ground-based interceptor missiles based in Alaska and California. That program has also been in existence for over a decade, but only about half the tests have been successful, according to the Defense Department.
In the most recent Pentagon report on weapons testing across the department, the long-range system was criticized. The report said it "demonstrates a limited capability to defend the US homeland from small numbers of simple intermediate-range or intercontinental ballistic missile threats launched from North Korea or Iran."
The report went on to say that the Pentagon continued to discover new failures during testing.
In the upcoming test, a missile will be launched from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California and attempt to intercept a simulated missile over the Pacific Ocean.
As part of a broader National Security Council review of options for dealing with North Korea, the Pentagon has been considering its military options for more than a month in case the White House were to decide to take such action, a defense official said. The NSC effort is also looking at diplomatic and economic options.
The official pointed out the recent engagement with the Chinese, and the stronger language calling for more Chinese pressure on North Korea, is the most immediate impact of that review.
The review of military options is essentially "due diligence," the official said. Top military and civilian Pentagon officials are "thinking through every course of action."
That also involves updating any analysis on the latest thinking of how North Korea might militarily react if the US were to take military steps.
The official emphasized that all of the ongoing work doesn't change the administration -- and Pentagon's -- emphasis on the need for a peaceful diplomatic solution.
The official was adamant that the US is currently not anticipating pre-emptive military action against North Korea. Standard policy -- which calls for shooting down of a North Korean missile after launch if the trajectory is deemed to threaten South Korea, Japan or the US -- remains in place.
The review also is aimed at ensuring necessary military assets are properly situated if there is a need for military action. Multiple US officials said all current anti-missile ships and other ground-based interceptors in Alaska are available.
Even as the military options are reviewed and updated, Defense Secretary James Mattis is also underscoring the need for a non-military solution.
"You're aware that the leader of North Korea again recklessly tried to provoke something by launching a missile," he recently told reporters. "It was not an intercontinental ballistic missile, it failed on launch, and it shows why we're working so closely right now with the Chinese."
Both countries are trying "to get this under control and aim for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula," he said. "China and the United States and South Korea, Japan, we all share that same interest."

Phocus extraordinaire
The Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest 2017 kicked off and photographers and videographers from around the world are now vying for the grand prize and revered title of Cinnamon Photographer of the Year. Joining the panel of judges this year to select the very best visuals and clips, renowned photographer Karl Taylor will bring over 20 years of experience to the contest. Taylor has worked on numerous global assignments for some of the worlds top leisure brands and is a much sought after advertising and commercial photographer with a distinct multi-disciplinary approach. In this interview, Karl Taylor shares his top tips and insights, in the hope that they will inspire participants of the Cinnamon Sri Lanka Photo Contest to shoot striking and memorable images that truly tell a story.
Taylor started his career in the field of photojournalism and enjoys shooting across a range of genres. His ethos variety is the spice of life clearly reflects his visual philosophies for creating effective images that have a universal appeal.
Q: How do you get the person, place or thing that is in front of the camera depicted on film the way you want them to be
With photography, one must realize that cameras whether digital or film do not record things in the same way that our eyes and brain perceive them. Good photographers can either use that to their advantage to create a sort of hyper reality and they can also use the knowledge of lighting, composition, subject matter and lens choices to make a picture rather than just take a picture.
Q: What or who influences/inspires your work
Ive been influenced by many things and photographers over the years since I started in photography. When I was a teenager I used to be fascinated by the images in National Geographic and followed photographers like Sam Abell, Jodi Cobb and Steve McCurry. As I moved more towards advertising photography I became interested in the work of Bob Carlos Clarke, Rankin and Lichfield. However, it is also cinematography and just general observation of the world around me that often inspires me the most.
Q: If your photographs could speak, what would they have to say How do you get them to say this
Most of my photographs need to speak desirability. That is the objective of an advertising photographer, to make the mundane into the magical and make everyday objects such as cosmetics, electronic, sunglasses become desirable. It is the art of persuasion through dynamic images and the emotional message is always to make them become desirable.
Q: Briefly tell us how your career path has been
I started out in photojournalism in my early/mid 20s and then I switched to advertising photography in my late 20s and thats where Ive remained since. About 10 years ago I started talking about photography and presenting lectures and then from there grew the training side of our business where we now train photographers from all over the world through our online courses and I also do this as part of my role as an ambassador for Hasselblad and Broncolor.
Q: Would you recommend any particular tech/software/camera
I shoot mostly with a Hasselblad in the studio and that has its own software called Phocus which I enjoy using. I also use Adobe Photoshop for final retouching. Occasionally, I also shoot on a Canon 5dmk3.
What is your motivation
Q: Economic Political Intellectual Emotional
Id have to say my main motivations are economic and emotional. I love photography and creating images, it has always been my passion but I also treat it as a business because, afterall, I am running a business.
Q: How would you describe your style
Clarity and precision are the cornerstones of my personal style. My aim is to always capture as close to perfect an image on the camera as possible. Im known for adhering to the careful use of lighting and minimal use of Photoshop where possible so that my images retain a clarity and believability that makes them more accepted visually than the often over photoshopped images that we see today.
Q: Can you briefly describe, for the benefit of the readers, your photographic workflow
First, I examine the object that Im going to photograph very carefully, I look at it and examine its aesthetics its flaws and its characteristics before I start setting up. Based on that examination I already can conceive how Im going to light it or what will show the object off at its best. I then set about carefully lighting the object and testing and adjusting until I arrive at the point where I introduce another light and another until my vision has been achieved. The final image is then exported as a 16bit tiff and the RAW file may be worked on further for final tweaks in Phocus or Photoshop.
Q: What is your most memorable assignment Why Also tell usmore about a favorite image that you shot recently Describe its creation  location, lighting, composition  your thoughts when creating the image and what it means to you
A few years ago I shot a series of fashion images at various remote locations around Iceland, it was extremely hard work for the model and crew in very cold, windy conditions. Yet everyone was committed to getting the results and we produced some wonderful images. I recently created an image of a girl falling in an open white space, surrounded by delicately positioned white balloons on the floor. The image was to represent, letting go or not being in control of your own actions. It was carefully lit using just two studio lights, you can see the image on this page of my website: http://karltaylorportfolio.com/overview/.
Q: How would you describe the photography industry at the moment
The industry has changed dramatically since I started in 1994. Digital took over, stock libraries took over, social media took over and the amount of photographers increased dramatically. This led to a downturn in the amount of work available for the low to mid-range level photographers as there was too much supply and the credit crash made clients tighten their budgets. Even the photographers at the top felt the pinch, hopefully those that deserve to, will survive.
Q: Advice to somebody who wants to pursue photography
Its never been an easy career to succeed in but if you have the talent, the passion and the ability to market yourself then you can make it. However, if I was starting out again now at the age of 23 Id probably advise myself that it would be a long road ahead to get where I want to be and it would probably be a tougher journey now than it was then. I think the most important thing is to not get hung up on doing it for a living, just concentrate on how to make good pictures first.
Q: If you could be invisible for one day with your camera
Well assuming they couldnt sense me in any way, then photographing Great White sharks in the ocean, or photographing my kids.
Q: Photographic ambitions yet to achieve
When my kids are older and when I get the chance to escape for a few months Id actually really like to turn my hand to reportage photography and shoot an article for National Geographic. I think what I now know about creating images would change the way I shoot that genre compared to when I started 20 plus years ago.
To conclude his interview, we asked Karl Taylor what he would say to someone who said I want to be the next Karl Taylor. He simply replied, Actually, Id advise them to be themselves and Id wish them the best of luck on their photographic journey and adventures.

PickMe rewards patrons, partners with PickMe Waasi, Lakshapathi Waram
PickMe, the tech-based taxi hailing start-up continues to be more a part of daily transport, especially in Colombo, as it has become a very popular choice among many daily commuters over a short period of 18 months since its launch in June 2015.
Many of our patrons seem to feel that we've been in operation for much longer than 18 months. This notion kindles in us the humble pride of knowing that we have become much closer to their hearts and lives than we would have imagined possible when we first launched says Portia Ratnayake, VP-Communications at PickMe. We've been welcomed, encouraged and tolerated by our patrons with a lot of love and patience since day one she added.
PickMe announced a three month loyalty program for their patrons called PickMe Waasi where 1000 passengers will be awarded with PickMe merchandise every week. 100 passengers will be gifted with a Rs. 10,000 shopping voucher every month for three months and one cash prize of Rs. 1 million will be awarded to a lucky winner on the 10th of June 2017. There will also be 10 consolation prizes of the grand draw where 10 other lucky passengers will win an iPhone 7 each. A certain target number of rides must be achieved by patrons against each rewarding level to be eligible for the draw.The targets are very easily achieved by our regular passengers. We designed this program in such a way that by the end of the three months, most of our regular patrons would have won at least a few weekly gifts from us. A lot of thought and effort has been put in to the program from the selecting of the gifts to the communications with the passengers, we wanted it to be a personal tribute, representing the true respect we have for our patrons said Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive Officer of PickMe.
So far, PickMe has rewarded 5000 weekly winners and the first 100 monthly winners for the month of March.
The feedback we receive from our patrons regarding the PickMe Waasi program is very encouraging, to say the least says Portia.
Though most of the excitement is visible at the passenger end, PickMe says that PickMe Waasi is not the only loyalty program they are running these days.'PickMe Lakshapathi Waram is the rewarding scheme launched simultaneously for their driver-partners where PickMe rewards one out-standing performer with Hundred Thousand rupees every week. The fifth driver to win his hundred thousand rupees, Tharanga Pushpakumara who drives a three wheeler, collected his cheque from Ajit Gunewardene, Chairman of PickMe, at a conference held at Ramada Colombo on April 7.

Political reasons fuelling India-Lanka fisheries tiff

Politics, rather than science, is playing an important role in marine fisheries governance especially in South Asian countries, said Maarten Bavinck, a Dutch scientist, whose research projects include providing space for small scale fishers of India and Sri Lanka, The Indian Express reported today.
The dispute between India and Sri Lanka over the fishing activities in the Palk Bay remain unsolved mainly due to political reasons, he said while delivering a lecture on Tropical Marine Fisheries Governance: The Way Forward, organised by the Marine Biological Association of India (MBAI) at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) on Tuesday. Bavinck, a professor at the University of Amsterdam in Netherlands s
aid the Tamil Nadu Government should initiate steps to reduce its fishing fleets in the Palk Bay to resolve the conflict in the region.
Trawling needs to be contained in the Palk Bay, where fishing activities across the international boundary line have been causing social and economic hardship for around 25,000 small scale fishermen and their families in Northern Sri Lanka. This has led to political tensions between the neighbours, he said.
Interacting with the CMFRI scientists, Bavinck said science-based guidelines are needed to ease the tension in the region. For this, Indias CMFRI and Sri Lankas National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) should conduct joint studies and make coordinated efforts to find a science-based solution, hesaid.
The Dutch scientist said solid ecological and marine biological studies were required to estimate the damage caused to the rich resources in the Palk Bay due to intensive trawling.
Fisheries administrators should prioritise employment and the distribution of income among the fishing community as the sector is a very important livelihood option in India.
According to him, the number of fishermen is still growing in India because they are unable to find alternative employment.
Economic development in India is centred around the cities and the IT sector, he said. With marine resources largely concentrated on the continental shelf, there is no reason to go for larger scale operations in the country, said Bavinck.

The Foxhill Super Cross which is organized by Sri Lanka Armys Military Academy for the 25th time will be held at the Nariyakanda racing track on April 22.
A significant feature this year is that a name that goes parallel to Silver Jubilee, Silver being the main sponsor of Foxhill Super Cross which is also celebrating its Silver Jubilee this year, said Aroos Ahmed, Chief Operating Officer, Rainco Private Limited addressing a media briefing on Foxhill Super Cross which was held recently.
Silver products which have a proven track record in the protection and maintenance of footwear will also be officially unveiled to the consumer public at the Foxhill Super Cross, he said.
The Silver brand which will be introduced to the market under the theme Walk with Confidence is a high quality product that could easily outshine competitor products available in the market. The main reason for this is Silver products are manufactured in a top footwear protection product manufacturing facility in Turkey sans artificial chemical inputs using natural Palmyra wax material imported from Germany.
Therefore we believe that the Silver Jubilee of the Foxhill Super Cross is the opportune time to take the message to the public about the advent of such a reliable superior brand to the market, added Aroos Ahmed. Foxhill Super Cross is organized annually to obtain the necessary capital that is required to maintain the infrastructure and training facilities by the Lanka Armys Military Academy to train military personnel and to be par with Asia regions military training facilities.

Rename Mankad fumes Gavaskar
NEW DELHI, Tuesday  Batting great Sunil Gavaskar wants the term Mankad dropped from cricketing parlance, saying linking the famously controversial dismissal to Indian all-rounder Vinoo Mankad smears the legends name.
The term -- used when a bowler runs out a non-striker before delivery -- was coined 70 years ago when Mankad twice ran out Bill Brown at the bowlers end during Indias tour of Australia in 1947.
Mankad was widely criticised for unsporting play, despite warning Brown several times that he was straying from his crease.
Australian skipper Donald Bradman and Brown himself also defended the Indian bowler but the term -- loaded with negative connotations of bad sportsmanship -- stuck for generations.
But 70 years down the track, former Indian captain Gavaskar wants the term amended, arguing it should be renamed Browned after the Australian player who was at fault.
I have grave objections to that because its putting one of Indias cricketing legends in a bad light, Gavaskar said on the Sony Max TV channel during an Indian Premier League Twenty20 match.
He has been one of Indias all-time great cricketers. Our legends name should not be spoiled. If you want to call it anything, just say the batsman was Browned, not Mankaded.
His comments come just a fortnight after the Marylebone Cricket Club, which oversees administration of the sport, declared it was updating the rule governing the dismissal to put the onus on the non-striker to remain in his/her ground.
Dismissing a batsman at the non-striking end remains contentious in the world of cricket.
Sri Lankas Sachithra Senanayake was widely criticised by the English press in 2014 after he dismissed Jos Buttler in this fashion during a one-day international in 2014.

Report on fee hike for Sri Lankan helpers misleading: Envoy
Reports of a hefty rise in recruitment fees for Sri Lankan domestic helpers, including maids, are misleading, said Sri Lankan Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Azmi Thassim on Sunday.
The Sri Lankan government is not involved in the hike of recruitment fees because business transactions are done by private Saudi and Sri Lankan agents, he said.
A report published in local Arabic press said Sri Lankan recruitment offices have raised recruitment costs of domestic workers from $1,560 to $3,000, representing a 92 percent hike.
The report added that Sri Lankan agents have been delaying or suspending travel permits of workers waiting to be deployed in the Kingdom to put pressure on Saudi recruitment offices to pay the hefty amount for hiring domestic aides.
Thassim said: The Kingdom and Sri Lanka will be holding talks soon to address the grievances of the parties concerned, and will hammer out a solution to the problem.
The Saudi Embassy in Sri Lanka earlier issued an instruction for Saudi recruitment agents to pay $1,560 to hire a Sri Lankan housemaid, he added.
In the run-up to the holy month of Ramadan and Eid festivities, Saudi Arabia requires more household workers.
Both governments are keen to talk and solve the issue, but private business transactions between Saudi and Sri Lankan recruitment agencies cannot be stopped by the government until Riyadh and Colombo reach a settlement, the envoy said.
The report quoted Hussain Al-Mutairi, head of the recruitment committee at the Eastern Province Chamber of Commerce and Industry, as saying: Sri Lankan recruitment offices have played with recruitment costs, which were at $1,560 as stipulated by an agreement signed between the Saudi and Sri Lankan offices.
He added that the Sri Lankan offices have also hiked other related charges including the monthly salary, which was raised and fixed at SR1,300 ($346) by Sri Lankan agents last February compared to SR1,100 as previously agreed.
Al-Mutairi accused Sri Lankan recruitment offices of exerting enormous pressure on their Saudi counterparts.
He called on Saudi offices not to respond to these pressures ... A unified position from the Saudi side will make the Sri Lankan offices work in line with the unified price agreed upon by both parties.
Saudi Arabia is home to about 200,000 Sri Lankan workers, about 50 percent of them domestic helpers, mostly housemaids. - Arab News

## Title: Resolving debt knots
## Supertitle:

Resolving debt knots
Sri Lanka faces a serious problem: the country is heavily indebted; total public debt rose to Rs. 9,401,969 million (or Rs.9.4 trillion) as at September 2016. As a % of GDP, public debt stood at 76% in 2015 and the rating agency Fitch estimates this has increased to 77% of GDP by end 2016.
More frighteningly, servicing this debt, paying the interest and the capital consumed 90.6% of total government revenue in 2015. The debt service cost has remained at over 90% for most of the last 10 years and has even exceeded 100% in some years (in 2009, 2010 and 2013).
If the majority of what the Government collects as taxes and grants is spent paying interest and capital on its outstanding debts how is other expenditure funded By further borrowing, which means that in subsequent years the interest cost will keep rising. The Government takes on new loans to repay old ones and we end up spending more each year to service debt than on health, education, indeed almost everything else combined.
Government services
Sri Lanka is in a debt trap; the majority of the Governments income goes to repay debts and further debt is incurred to pay for government services. This is clearly unsustainable and has been so for some time.
Sri Lanka has not reported a surplus on the current account (meaning that revenues do not cover recurrent costs) from 1990, which is as far back as the published figures go. Further, the position keeps worsening; the current account deficit which was Rs.3,807m in 1990 has continued to deteriorate steadily to reach Rs. 246,779m in 2015. The position is now reaching a critical stage, as successive IMF bailouts in 2009, 2011 and 2016 testify. (See Table)
To try and close the deficit on the current account the Government has resorted to sharp increases in taxes. In the 2016 budget VAT, withholding taxes, telecoms taxes, excise duties and a multitude of taxes on businesses have increased. The citizenry, already burdened by high cost of living are reeling under the impact of the tax increases and the scope for further increases is limited, unless the Government wants to court widespread unpopularity.
It now becomes apparent that we cannot ignore the case for cutting outlays any longer. When cutting costs it is always good to start with the largest items, because even a small percentage reduction will deliver large absolute benefits. If debt service consumes 90% of Government revenue then trying to reduce this should be a priority.
As any banker will advise, the simplest way to prune the debt is to dispose of underutilised assets and use the proceeds to settle debt. If a sufficiently large quantum of assets were disposed, in combination with the recent increases in tax it will be possible to bring the current account into surplus with the surplus being used to reduce debt still further. We thus turn a vicious circle of ever increasing debt service costs into a virtuous circle of steadily reducing debt.
Dispose of state assets
This is the basic rationale for Sri Lanka to dispose of state assets: we have been living beyond our means on borrowed money. If we are not to collapse under the weight of our debts then we need to arrest the situation immediately and pay off as much debt as possible. Disposing of assets will allow the Government to raise funds to reduce debt.
While the need for disposing assets is now clear, selecting which ones to dispose of has sparked a furious debate. The Government has proceeded very timidly, identifying a few non-strategic assets for disposal: the Hyatt Hotel, Litro Gas; the Colombo Hilton, Grand Orient Hotel and Waters Edge and Lanka Hospitals.
This is an uncontentious list of assets. These serve no wider public interest, all were relatively recent acquisitions, many being expropriated from private hands under dubious circumstances under the Revival of Underperforming Enterprises and Underutilized Assets Act of 2011.
Surprisingly, there is objection to even this. The objectors make no real case for not disposing these assets but resort to ideological arguments that these represent public assets of great significance that should never be touched. How a collection of hotels, a distributor of cooking gas and a fee-levying hospital run on private lines could be considered vital to public welfare is a mystery.
What the Government should be concerned with is the process of disposal: open bids must be called and the whole process must be transparent and free of political interference.
Stock Exchange
The Government should follow the successful model used in the past, offering 60% of the shares on open bidding and subsequently selling a further 30% of the shares to the public and listing the company on the Stock Exchange. The employees are gifted 10% of the shares free of charge.
The businesses selected for sale are distinct legal entities in their own right and are not insolvent or overburdened with debt. As many were already listed, they are compliant with SEC rules and publish financials on time, an indication that internal systems and processes are in a workable state. The accounts of most SOEs are usually about three years in arrears and serve as a damning indictment of state management.
In other words these are relatively easy privatisations. Their disposal should be fast-tracked. In parallel a wider review of SOEs to determine the benefit they bring to the wider public and the merits of disposal must be undertaken.

SAGT stand-off ends
The near two week industrial action by the private container terminal, South Asia Gateway Terminals (SAGT), ended yesterday. The disruption caused the diversion of several vessels to the two other terminals in the port.
Following 13 days of operational disruption at its berth, team SAGT made a ground breaking deal that brought a mutually satisfactory end to the stand-off, SAGT chief executive, Erwin Haaze, said.
The company said it expects to be back to normal within 48 hours and normalise its berthing window protocols within this week.
This agreement maintained the sanctity of the Collective Agreement (CA) signed just six months ago, yet enabled us to accomplish a sustainable outcome based on sensible principles of workforce engagement in a commercially responsible way, said Chandana Wijayanama, SAGTs General Manager for Human Resources.
There is a collective determination by all involved to ensure disruption of this nature does not recur.
That is the most important achievement - to foster an environment conducive to delivering a reliable, consistent and sustainable best in class service level to our customers, he said.

The Sampur Hospital currently being renovated and constructed is to be declared open by President Maithripala Sirisena on May 7, said the Provincial Health Minister A.L.M. Nazeer.
Nazeer told Daily News that the Eastern Provincial Health Ministry took immediate measures to upgrade the hospital as a District Hospital and to rectify the shortcomings of the hospital by renovating and constructing new buildings for the benefit of the people.
The people of Sampur have experienced immense hardships due to the lack of proper medical services due to the poor infrastructure facilities available at the hospital.
The Provincial Ministry having identified the shortcomings took measures to address these issues. The Provincial Ministry will continue to develop the hospital further, said Nazeer.
The Provincial Health Minister together with relevant officers visited the hospital to inspect the progress of development work recently.

Sanchez, Ozil strike to end Arsenal away woes
Middlesbrough: Goals from Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil ended Arsenal's run of four successive away defeats with a scratchy 2-1 victory over struggling Middlesbrough in their Premier League clash on Monday.
The Gunners' performance was far from convincing but will still bring some relief to their beleaguered manager Arsene Wenger.
There was a period after Alvaro Negredo scored an equaliser when Middlesbrough, who have won only four league games this season, looked capable of going on to claim their fifth scalp. Arsenal are new seven points behind fourth-placed Manchester City with a game in hand, while Middlesbrough lie six points from safety and have also played one game fewer than most of the teams above them.
"It (the top four) is mathematically still alive," Wenger told Sky Sports.
"We knew we needed to win. Now we have a little break with the FA Cup (they play Manchester City on Sunday in the semi-final) and then we come back again to the league." AFP

Sangakkara (136) takes Surrey to top of county table
LONDON: Sri Lanka great Kumar Sangakkaras century helped Surrey to a draw with Lancashire at the Oval that saw the hosts go top of the table in the English County Championship match on Monday.
Scott Borthwick (108 not out) and fellow left-hander Sangakkara (136) put on 256 for the third wicket.
Dropped at slip on 72, Sangakkara was eventually out when bowled round his legs by former England left-arm spinner Simon Kerrigan.
Former Australia batsman Adam Voges made 92 as Middlesex launched the defence of their county championship title with a hard-fought draw away to Hampshire.
Voges, the oldest player to make a hundred on Test debut when he scored 130 against the West Indies as a 35-year-old in 2015, called time on his international career this year.
And last month saw the now 37-year-old West Australian announce his retirement from Australian domestic first-class cricket.
But he could still play a key role as Lords-based Middlesex look to retain the First Division title.
Middlesex were 111 for four overnight, a lead of just 29 runs, and in danger of suffering a last-day defeat against a Hampshire side who opened their Championship campaign with a surprise win away to Yorkshire.
Voges, 29 not out overnight at Southampton, was in sight of what would have been his 33rd first-class century when, just three deliveries after Hampshire took the new ball, he was caught behind off former South Africa fast bowler Kyle Abbott.
Voges, whose Test average of 68.87 is second only to Donald Bradman, arguably crickets greatest batsman, among players who have featured in at least 20 Tests, batted for nearly four hours, facing 196 balls including 19 fours. His exit was the start of a three-wicket collapse that left Middlesex struggling at 215 for seven.
But the tail wagged and a draw was agreed with Middlesex on 278 for nine declared in their second innings. Abbott maintained his fine start to the season by taking five for 59. Elsewhere, England leg-spinner Adil Rashid took the one wicket Yorkshire needed to secured an innings and 88-run win away to Warwickshire at Edgbaston.
In-form Yorkshire paceman Ben Coad took five wickets in each innings for a match haul of 10 for 102.
In the Second Division, there was a foretaste of a potential Ashes battle to come as Nottinghamshire beat Durham by nine wickets at Chester-le-Street.
England opener Keaton Jennings carried his bat for an unbeaten 102 in Durhams second innings 250 against a Nottinghamshire attack led by Australia fast bowler James Pattinson.
The duo could be in opposition when England defend the Ashes in Australia later this year and personal honours from this match were about even after Pattinson bowled Jennings for 28 in Durhams meagre first-innings 162.
Defeat left Durham on minus 45 points after they were hit with a 48-point penalty and demoted to the second tier last season after receiving a financial bail-out from the England and Wales Cricket Board.
In a round of matches where several batsmen were dismissed within sight of hundreds, former South Africa Twenty20 international Richard Levi (99) and Rob Newton (98) helped Northamptonshire chase down a target of 326 in 65 overs to beat Derbyshire by three wickets.
Meanwhile veteran Kent all-rounder Darren Stevens starred with both bat and ball in a 226-run win away to Sussex at Hove.
The 40-year-old, whod already made two fifties, took five for 51 as Sussex were dismissed for 200 on Monday. - AFP

Shed political differences and help Meethotamulla victims: Asgiriya prelate
It is important on the part of all to set aside political animosity and differences and join hands in providing relief to the people affected by the Meethotamulla tragedy, said most Ven. Warakagoda Gnanarathane Mahanayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter.
The need of the hour was assistance towards the affected people and the government should take measures to provide immediate relief to them, he said.
The prelate expressed these sentiments delivering an amassing when Jathika Hela Urumayas organiser for the Maharagama electorate Asanga Jayaratne called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday.
The prelate said he observed Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka working with great dedication to promote development in the country. He said a majority of Buddhists today seemed to offer pride of place to Amisa (material) pooja over Prathipaththi (principles) pooja nowadays and certain anti-Buddhist forces were still active in the country.
Asanga Jayaratne said if politicians used the Meethotamulla tragedy to blame each other, the real victims of the tragedy would not gain any benefits.

Some goodbyes are for remembering
It all began with a phone call more than a year ago. Back then I was writing to another newspaper, penning about five or six articles a week. Someone wanted to get an article done on an old woman. She was, this person told me, an actress, a singer, and a performer. I didnt know who Edna Sugathapala was. This person had another contact, by the way. A lady. She knew Edna. She wanted a write-up done. I obliged.
Those were easy days. Not-so-hectic days. I went, interviewed, and came back. I didnt know Edna before I met her and I am still not sure whether I know her or the worth of what she's done. Either way, I liked the interview. One thing led to another, however, that newspaper I was writing to closed down, and we were in need of another publication and outfit to get it in. I personally felt responsible, because of Edna and the fact that no one had written on her before. She seemed nice. And she obviously had done something.
In the end we found an outfit. Daily News. This was in November 2015. One phone call followed another, the contacts were made, and the article eventually got published. I was still a student then, so I had time to kill. That is why, when I got to know that the article had merited enough attention to raise the possibility of me doing an entire series of other men and women like her, for a weekly column, I was thrilled. I couldnt have known of the pressure entailed in such an enterprise, but I couldnt have cared less. The second article, on Swineetha Weerasinghe (another belittled actor), soon got published. The column had a name by then: Stars of Yesteryear.
Initially I focused on films. That was easy territory. The names kept on rolling: Douglas Ranasinghe, Lester James and Sumitra Peries, Anoja Weerasinghe, Chandran Rutnam, Dharmasiri Bandaranayake, Malini Fonseka, and even long gone, lamented stars: Tony Ranasinghe, Gamini Fonseka, Rukmani Devi, and Vijaya Kumaratunga. For reasons even I cant comprehend, I had met or "done" these people before. I had time to kill, after all. That time proved crucial for me, as the column kept on expanding and as I moved on to other streams: music, theatre, dance, literature.
I stopped counting after a point. Its not hard to come up with four or five articles a month and I dont think its a feat to be proud of. There were people who advised, who helped. There were also exams and other commitments. All these factored in. In the end I met a horde of people. Id like to think they improved my writing.
Stars of Yesteryear was not just a column, by the way. It was unprecedented in that no English newspaper here before the Daily News had the guts to start archiving those whod enriched our cultural landscape. People talked of Lester James Peries but no one really took down what he was saying. People sang praises of Premasiri Khemadasa and Ajantha Ranasinghe but no one really took down their way of looking at the world. That is why, as a column on its own right (forgetting your humble columnist, me), it merits praise and attention.
Last week I wrote my last article to that column. On another, as unheard of artiste: Premaranjith Tilakaratne. Premaranjith was, ever since I first met him years ago, an advisor to me, one of those people who brought newspapers not to peruse the advertisements or employment sections (as most do) but to read what was actually in them. I remember a prominent journalist telling me, Uditha, people dont read. I remember arguing with another prominent journalist over this same issue: all he had to say was, Uditha, youve got to move on with the times. I prefer the first to the second, needless to say. And Premaranjith, Gamini, Lester, and this column taught me why.
This is hence not an anniversary, but a farewell. Farewells usually merit remembrance. And gratitude. I will hence remember and be grateful.Then there was that other man and lady who got me in contact with Edna. Let me start with the lady. I never met her in person after that first encounter, but I know shes in a completely different industry and one in which the arts take a backseat to profit. Sandra Mack, designer, photographer, creative soul, and conversationalist has always been another keen follower of the arts. I have come across those her age who dont know of Amaradeva and I am happy that she is different. She knows how to talk convivially and how to explain. She enthrals. In more ways than one, with her knowledge and friendliness. She got me into this column and, whether or not she acknowledges it, she was responsible. So Sandra, I am grateful. Thank you.
Some of these people Ive written on are still alive. Some have gone away. Others went away long before we knew they had. Consequently, I cant pick on a favourite. I value what each of them had to say and I value the many other readers I befriended (some of whom I have met in person). Its impossible to think of a column doing all this, but then people do read. Its just that those who value the written word tend to read more. And that those who tend to read more are older and wiser than the young who (usually) do not.
So what now I hope Stars of Yesteryear will continue or be resuscitated soon. I am sorry to say that I will be unable to continue. These past two years saw the death of so many of our past masters. No archive or fancy building will be enough to salvage their memory, if all we do is forget. Perhaps what every newspaper needs, then, is its own Stars of Yesteryear column. Not because it will give aspiring writers an opportunity to write, but because, in archiving names long forgotten, they will be resurrected for remembrance and gratitude.

The Sri Lankan Under 18 sevens rugby team which won the Asian Sevens series under the captaincy of Thomian Navin Heenakankanamge have qualified to take part in the Youth Commonwealth Games to be held in Bahamas from July 17 to 23 for the first time in the countrys rugby history. The team coached by M.J.M. Mushtaq won the Asian series last year held in Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei and thereby qualified for this tournament.
Sri Lanka has the rare honour of being the only country that will be represented from the Asian region. The only setback for the junior tuskers is that most of the players who played last years tournament will not be able to represent them in this tournament due to the eligible age category rule.
Trials to pick the final under 18 squad will most probably be held by end of the month.

Sri Lanka's REDD+ programme launches country's first National Forest Monitoring System platform
With the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in September 2015 and the new agreement on climate change at COP21 in Paris, Sri Lanka received a much-needed push towards implementing its ambitious forest-centric development agenda.
With the vision of Forests and beyond, sustaining life and livelihoods in a greener Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka UN-REDD Programme,which is the United Nations collaborative initiative on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) in developing countries, supported the Forest Department to launch the country's National Forest Monitoring System (NFMS) at Waters Edge Hotel recently.
Joining hands with the Forest Department of Sri Lanka, was the Department of Wildlife Conservation, Survey Department, Climate Change Secretariat, Central Environment Authority and the Natural Resource Management Centre. Each of these government institutions have been a part of the National Task Force formed to serve and offer technical advice and expertise on the development of this portal.
This online geo-portal containing forest-related data storage, analysis, and information dissemination, was launched with the aim of helping to decrease the threat to forests and to ensure permanence in preserving the forests in the country.
It has three major components that includes: the Satellite Land Monitoring Systems, which collects and assesses activity data (over time) related to forest land; the National Forest Inventory (NFI), which holds information relevant for estimating emissions, emissions factors such as forest carbon stocks and forest carbon stock changes, among other; and the Greenhouse Gas Inventory data. Currently, the geo-portal also comprises of base maps, country boundaries, provinces, districts and DS Divisions, forest assistant divisions, forest masks and maps, NFI plots and grids, land use and land cover data, satellite imagery, agro-ecological regions, soil maps, protected areas that include wildlife areas, world heritage sites, environmental protection areas, conservation forest areas and forest reserves, terrain and water bodies such as river basins, rain gauge stations, and reservoirs under construction.
The data and information provided will be transparent, consistent over time, and suitable for measuring, reporting and verifying, taking into account national capabilities and capacities.
The launch event covered an introduction to the project, its progress and implementation, discussions on the way forward and future plans. Speakers at the launch included Udaya Seneviathne, Secretary for the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, Anura Sathrusinghe, Conservator General of Forests (CGF) and National Programme Director of the Sri Lanka UN-REDD Programme, MsInge Jonckheere, Team Leader for Remote Sensing and Web Portals for REDD+ and Raushan Kumar, Forestry Officer of the Sri Lanka UN-REDD Programme.
The event was attended by participants representing the main government departments involved in the initiative, along with many other key government institutions.
We now have an acceptable method to monitor the forests in Sri Lanka, as we work towards increasing Sri Lanka's forest cover according to the VanaRopa programme of the Government of Sri Lanka, said Conservator General of Forests Anura Sathurusinghe commenting on the successful launch of the NFMS geo-portal.
"With Sri Lanka now getting ready to implement REDD+, the country will soon be eligible to receive funding from donor countries and institutions to increase its forest cover in response to the threat of global warming and climate change."

Things you didnt know you can do with your smartphone
Theres no denying it, from the moment we get up to the moment we go to bed, were all glued to our smartphones. A new work email. A new Facebook notification. The weather app tells us a storm is on the way. Theres always another reason to pick up our phones because they do so much.
You probably know the basics your smartphone can handle, but there are still some things your smartphone can do that might surprise you. Amaze and delight your friends  and yourself  when you handle these tasks with your trusty smartphone.
Diagnose a leaky window
Whether youre dealing with harsh winters in the Northeast or blazing summers in the South, poorly sealed windows and doors mean your home is never just the right temperature. Finding leaky windows doesnt just make a home more comfortable; it saves money on electric bills.
Turn your phone into a thermal imaging camera
This rectangular camera, weighing in at 2.8 ounces and measuring 2.8 x 1 x 0.7, plugs in to your phones charging port. It adds a little bulk to your phone, but not much, and its easy plug in when you need it. You may need to remove your phone from its case to use it.
Flir One works for both iPhone (any phone with a Lightning connector) and Android (any phone with a micro-USB connector) devices. Point your phone at an area, and watch it translate thermal energy into color images. Use it to scan the whole house to see where its hot when it should be cool or cool where it should be hot. Flir One can even tell you where pipes need better insulation or help locate overloaded circuits.
Measure your heart health
While fitness gadgets like Fitbit Charge and Apple Watch can give you data about your pulse, you wont get much detail. Dont take a trip to the doctor to get a detailed look at your heart health  theres a smartphone app (and device) for that.
AliveCors Kardia mobile heart monitor is smaller than a credit card and takes just 30 seconds to capture your EKG and tell you if your heart rhythm is normal. Press your fingers to the touchpads, and the Kardia app (for iPhone and Android devices) will give you a snapshot of your current heart activity. The app also takes voice memos for symptom tracking and securely shares health data with your doctor. It can be a good way to keep a close eye on your heart health if you are concerned about heart health.
Prevent drunk driving
Imagine youre at a house party with a few close friends. Youve all shared a glass or two of wine, and you feel like youre probably OK to drive  but it would be far more responsible to know for sure.
Thats where the Bluetooth BACtrack Vio Smartphone Breathalyzer comes in. The compact keychain device measures the alcohol present on your breath in just five seconds, then wirelessly sends your BAC reading to your iOS or Android smartphone. The included app predicts how long it will take for your levels to return to 0 percent. It can even call an Uber for you!
BACtrack is developing a wearable called the BACtrack Skyn that monitors and tracks transdermal alcohol content so you dont need to blow into a breathalyzer. It syncs to your phone via Bluetooth and keeps logs of your blood alcohol level. Theres no date yet when it will be available, but you can sign up to be notified when its available for preorder.
See everything up close
Your smartphone camera is already perfect for selfies and family snapshots. With some slight tweaks, you can turn it into a microscope to give yourself an all-new point of view. Satisfy your scientific curiosity (a microscopic examination of things from around the house makes a fun science project with the kids) or enjoy the aesthetics of greatly magnified photos.
Measure your muscles
As any health expert will tell you, your bathroom scale isnt the best way to measure your progress at the gym. Muscle weighs more than fat, so gaining the occasional pound or two can be a very good thing.
The Skulpt Scanner helps you get a better handle on your fitness by tracking body fat percentage and muscle fiber size, not weight. It uses small electrodes to measure individual muscle groups and areas, and it relays the information to your phone to give you an overall picture of where youre making progress and where youre not.
The device even comes with an app (for iPhone and Android devices) that recommends exercises best for your bodys unique composition plus advice from trainers and nutritionists on how to take your workout to the next level.
Do some math (without a calculator)
Sure, your phone already has a calculator built in, but it requires that you type out the equations. Thats fine if youre figuring out a tip or doing other simple calculations, but what about when you need to key in an algebra problem Or what if youre struggling to understand an equation on your homework that makes no sense to you at all
Photomath lets you take a picture of any math problem and get an immediate answer. It walks you through the steps to get to that answer, as well, making it a good learning tool. Photomath supports arithmetics, integers, fractions, decimal numbers, roots, algebraic expressions, linear equations and inequalities, quadratic equations and inequalities, absolute equations and inequalities, systems of equations, logarithms, trigonometry, exponential and logarithmic functions, derivatives and integrals.

Ties between Vietnam National State Assembly, SL Parliament to be strengthen
A special programme would be implemented to strengthen ties between the Vietnam National State Assembly and the Sri Lanka Parliament.
The decision was taken when Vietnam National State Assembly Chairman Nguyen Thi Kim Ngan met visiting Sri Lanka Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for bilateral talks in Hanoi recently.
Ngan requested the Prime Minister to convey her greetings and good wishes to the Speaker of the Sri Lanka Parliament Karu Jayasuiriya, and Wickremesinghe explained the untiring efforts made by the Speaker to strengthen the Sri Lanka Parliament.
Close co-operation and sharing of experiences among legislators of the two countries would prove beneficial for both countries, the meeting emphasised.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he would soon make arrangements for a Sri Lanka Parliamentary delegation co-ordinated by Ranjith Aluvihare, and the Oversight Committee Chairman on Parliamentary Affairs to undertake a study tour in Vietnam shortly.
Ngan said the Inter-parliamentary Union would be an ideal forum for close co-operation between the legislators of the two countries.

Trump mulls squeezing Iran with tougher sanctions
The White House is considering ramping up existing sanctions to hold Tehrans feet to the fire.
The Trump White House is poised to ratchet up existing sanctions against Iran and is weighing a much stricter interpretation of the nuclear agreement between Tehran and major world powers.
The administration is inclined to adopt a more rigorous application of the tools at its disposal, a senior White House official told
Foreign Policy, referring to sanctions policy. Among the options under consideration: broadening US sanctions to include much larger chunks of the Iranian economy linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
No final decision has been taken by the President or the Cabinet. But officials said some decisions will need to be taken soon. On April 25, Iran and the six governments that negotiated the nuclear deal with Tehran, including the United States, are due to meet in Vienna for a quarterly review of the accord.
High stakes
How President Donald Trump decides to proceed on sanctions and the nuclear deal more broadly carries high stakes for the United States, Iran, and the wider Middle East. A concerted US effort to squeeze Iran would represent a gamble that Tehrans regional push for power, particularly in Syria and Yemen, could be checked in part by increasing economic pressure.
But the approach could backfire if it causes tensions with the Islamic Republic to spin out of control or prompts Tehran to pull out of the nuclear deal. Tougher US sanctions would make for a tougher re-election fight for President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate who championed the 2015 nuclear deal but is under pressure to show Iranians a notable improvement in the economy. And a harder line on sanctions also could drive a wedge between Washington and its European allies.
Sweeping sanctions that cut across economic sectors could jeopardize the nuclear agreement and prompt Iran to withdraw, said Richard Nephew, who was the leading sanctions expert on the US team that negotiated the accord with Iran.
It all really comes down to whether the people making decisions agree that the nuclear deal is worth keeping, said Nephew, now at the Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs.
The 2015 agreement imposed numerous restrictions on Irans nuclear program in return for easing an array of sanctions - including US measures - that had badly damaged the countrys economy. President Trump repeatedly blasted the accord as the worst deal and, while on the campaign trail, vowed to tear it up, but now that he is in office, he has not indicated what he will do.
Trump doesnt have to tear up the deal to tighten the screws on Iran. The agreement, which is not a treaty, provides broad leeway to the governments that signed it in interpreting its terms, and the Trump White House is mulling taking a much more forceful stance on enforcing the deal to the letter.
There are already signs that the Trump administration is using existing legal authorities in a more forceful manner than the Barack Obama administration. Last Thursday, the Treasury Department announced it had sanctioned the brother of the powerful head of the special forces arm of the IRGC, Sohrab Soleimani, for his role in abuses at the countrys prisons. And in February, the Treasury Department blacklisted eight organizations linked to the Revolutionary Guards, as well as one of its officials based in Lebanon.
Tougher line
Last weeks move was a further indication that the Trump administration will be taking a much tougher line in applying sanctions than did its predecessor, said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who has urged ramping up economic pressure on Iran.
Dubowitz, an influential voice on sanctions policy particularly among Republican lawmakers in Congress, said he also expects the Trump administration to pursue more prosecutions of illicit financial activities linked to the Iranian regime and of attempts to secure prohibited materials related to weapons or nuclear technology.
The sanctions measures imposed since Trump entered office were based on cases prepared by the Obama Treasury Department that were never enacted, said the White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the administrations policy.
We are still going off the work they did not execute, the official said.
And Treasurys recent actions reflect a heightened focus by the administration on the Revolutionary Guards, which wield major military and financial clout in Iran and have interests in numerous Iranian companies. The Treasury actions coincide with a debate within the administration about whether to designate the entire IRGC as a terrorist organization. At the moment, only the groups special forces arm, the Quds Force, is blacklisted.
Apart from designating the entire Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization, the administration is also looking at other options. At the moment, any entity that has a 50 percent ownership stake or more held by the IRGC is subject to sanctions, but the administration is mulling a change that would drop the threshold to a lower percentage.
Such a move would break with long-standing policy at Treasury, which has traditionally defined ownership as above 50 percent for any category of sanctions. A lower threshold would mean blacklisting hundreds and possibly thousands of additional Iranian companies and organizations with links to the IRGC, experts said. That would almost certainly cause a political backlash in Iran and chill any international interest in investing in Iran. European officials - and former Obama administration officials - are worried that if the White House opts for a blanket blacklisting of the Revolutionary Guards, it could effectively kill the nuclear agreement or trigger retaliation against US-led forces in Iraq.
Additional sanctions
Appetite for a tougher stance isnt just found in the White House. In the Republican-controlled Congress, there is growing bipartisan support for pushing back against Iran through additional sanctions, though most Democrats want to steer clear of measures that would directly violate the nuclear deal. New bills in the House and Senate call for additional sanctions against Iran over its ballistic missile program and its human rights violations and support for terrorist groups.
The Senate bill, which has backing from some Democrats who endorsed the nuclear deal, would slap sanctions on any individual lending material support to Irans missile program. And it would also apply terrorism-related sanctions to the Revolutionary Guards.
The bills supporters say the provisions on the IRGC would merely codify existing presidential executive orders. But some former Obama administration officials argue the legislation could open the door to a sweeping designation of the entire IRGC as a terrorist organization.
The former officials say the sanctions legislation poses a possible threat to the nuclear deal as the measures could wreck the consensus among the countries that negotiated the deal.
Rather than containing Iran, such steps would isolate the United States, several former administration officials wrote in a commentary in FP.
Critics of the deal accused the Obama administration of tolerating Iranian violations of the accord. International inspectors found that Iran last year had twice exceeded limits on stockpiles of heavy water, which is used to cool reactors producing plutonium. Washington chose to resolve the issue discreetly, granting Iran some time to fix the problem. Opponents of the accord are urging the White House to insist on a more assertive interpretation of the deals provisions - and appear to have found a receptive audience.
Administration officials said they are now looking at holding Irans feet to the fire over every breach, however small. One option under consideration is an incredibly strict implementation of the deal, the senior official said.
But the official added that the administration was not inconsiderate of the ramifications of the deal and was carefully weighing the benefits and the risks of a different approach.
The Obama administration, facing complaints from Iran that it was not seeing the promised economic benefits from the accord, had embarked on road shows to reassure European governments and foreign companies that non-US investors could return to the Iranian market without necessarily running afoul of US sanctions. Rouhani is facing an electoral challenge from a hard-line favorite of the mullahs and needs to sell the deal as a success to win re-election next month.
But the road shows convinced few: Banks in particular are leery of diving back into the Iranian market when US sanctions could suddenly snap back or be expanded to other parts of the economy.
Its not surprising to me that financial institutions all over the world are hesitant to re-engage with Iran, said Daniel Glaser, a former senior Treasury official under the Obama administration who crafted hard-hitting sanctions that preceded the nuclear agreement.
Since Trump took office, the outreach effort has been abandoned.

Whats next after smartphone dies
One day, not too soon  but still sooner than you think  the smartphone will all but vanish, the way beepers and fax machines did before it. Make no mistake: We're still probably at least a decade away from any kind of meaningful shift away from the smartphone. (And if we're all cyborgs by 2027, I'll happily eat my words. Assuming we're still eating at all, I guess.)
Yet, piece by piece, the groundwork for the eventual demise of the smartphone is being laid by Elon Musk, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and a countless number of startups that still have a part to play.
And, let me tell you: If and when the smartphone does die, that's when things are going to get really weird for everybody. Not just in terms of individual products but in terms of how we actually live our everyday lives and maybe our humanity itself. Here's a brief look at the slow, ceaseless march toward the death of the smartphone  and what the post-smartphone world is shaping up to look like.
The short term
People think of the iPhone and the smartphones it inspired as revolutionary devices  small enough to carry everywhere, hefty enough to handle an increasingly large number of daily tasks, and packed full of the right mix of cameras and GPS sensors to make apps like Snapchat and Uber uniquely possible.
But consider the smartphone from another perspective. The desktop PC and the laptop are made up of some combination of a mouse, keyboard, and monitor. The smartphone just took that model, shrank it, and made the input virtual and touch-based.
So take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy S8, unveiled this week. It's gorgeous with an amazing bezel-less screen and some real power under the hood. It's impressive, but it's more refinement than revolution.
Tellingly, though, the Galaxy S8 ships with Bixby, a new virtual assistant that Samsung promises will one day let you control every single feature and app with just your voice. It will also ship with a new version of the Gear VR virtual reality headset, developed in conjunction with Facebook's Oculus.
The next iPhone, too, is said to be shipping with upgrades to the Siri assistant, along with features aimed at bringing augmented reality into the mainstream. And as devices like the Amazon Echo, the Sony PlayStation VR, and the Apple Watch continue to enjoy limited but substantial success, expect to see a lot more tech companies large and small taking more gambles and making more experiments on the next big wave in computing interfaces.
The medium term
In the medium term, all of these various experimental and first-stage technologies will start to congeal into something familiar but bizarre.
Microsoft, Facebook, Google, and the Google-backed Magic Leap are all working to build standalone augmented-reality headsets, which project detailed 3D images straight into your eyes. Even Apple is rumored to be working on this. Microsoft's Alex Kipman recently told Business Insider that augmented reality could flat-out replace the smartphone, the TV, and anything else with a screen. There's not much use for a separate device sitting in your pocket or on your entertainment center if all your calls, chats, movies, and games are beamed into your eyes and overlaid on the world around you.
At the same time, gadgetry like the Amazon Echo or Apple's own AirPods become more and more important in this world. As artificial-intelligence systems like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's Bixby, and Microsoft's Cortana get smarter, there will be a rise not just in talking to computers but in having them talk back.
In other words, computers will hijack your senses, more so than they already do, with your sight and your hearing intermediated by technology. It's a little scary. Think of what Facebook glitches could mean in a world where it doesn't just control what you read on your phone but in what you see in the world around you. The promise, though, is a world where real life and technology blend more seamlessly.
The major tech companies promise that this future means a world of fewer technological distractions and more balance, as the physical and digital world become the same thing. You decide how you feel about that.
The really crazy future
Still, all those decade-plus investments in the future still rely on gadgetry that you have to wear, even if it's only a pair of glasses. Some of the craziest, most forward-looking, most unpredictable advancements go even further  provided you're willing to wait a few extra decades, that is.
This week, we got our first look at Neuralink, a new company cofounded by Musk with a goal of building computers into our brains by way of "neural lace," a very early-stage technology that lays on your brain and bridges it to a computer. It's the next step beyond even that blending of the digital and physical worlds, as human and machine become one. Assuming the science works  and lots of smart people believe that it will  this is the logical endpoint of the road that smartphones started us on. If smartphones gave us access to information and augmented reality puts that information in front of us when we need it, then putting neural lace in our brains just closes the gap.

## Title: What's your preferred position

What's your preferred position
Besides the graceful arrangement of somersaults and twists in various positions and baranis or blind entries as landing positions, cliff diving differentiates between five basic groups: front  the diver takes off facing forwards and rotates forwards; back  the diver stands with his back to the water and rotates backwards; inward rotating dives  the body position is backwards but despite rotating backwards, the diver rotates in towards the platform, hence the name inward take-offs; reverse  the chest faces the water but the diver spins back towards the platform; and the handstand to finish it off.
The armstand can be executed from either the forward or backward direction and can include twists as well.
To spice competition up a little more, the two required dives  the easier dives with a lower Degree of Difficulty  must be performed from different take-off positions and so are the two more difficult and complex dives with DDs of up to 6.3. These are also called optionals. It can be tough when you start looking at the groups and what dives you have to do to fulfil certain needs. Obviously you want to be comfortable with your optionals, so the harder ones where you do more somersaults and twists. You definitely want to be comfortable in those two groups and then you kind of just have to play with the voluntary dives and get some versatility and figure out what works for you, explains Americas Steven LoBue, the owner of the only quint half in the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series.
It has a lot to do with personal preference and strengths as a diver as to how that manifests itself in a cliff diving career. While 29-year-old LoBue is the master of rotational dives with his front five somersaults pike, Blake Aldridge and David Colturi, for example, are extremely good twisters. They feel the twist, they know where everything is. And certainly, there are dive groups, which are more difficult - handstands, for example. Orlando Duque cant do a handstand very well, he has a lot of problems with his wrists. Some others, like Russias Artem Silchenko, are so stable and solid, so he prefers to do that.
And also when you do a handstand you get a little bit more Degree of Difficulty, so thats the incentive to actually dive from your hands, describes Joey Zuber, the cliff diving expert. When theres a preferred position, like in the case of the American LoBue, who favours forward dives as he enjoys looking at the water and getting a chance to appreciate the surroundings and the venue, theres also a position you try to avoid, as four-time World Series champion Gary Hunt says: I have much more difficulty doing reverse take-offs, because I broke my leg and sprained my ankle when I was 16 and my ankle really tightened up and so when I bend my leg at the end of the platform, I cant bend so far down. I have to lift one of my heels up when Im facing forwards. That makes it hard for me to stay at a decent distance away from the board; so thats definitely one of the groups Id avoid doing.
The main reason why this rule of different diving positions was introduced to the World Series was to encourage the athletes to acquire a more versatile diving programme and that plays into Blake Aldridges hands. The former Olympian from England thinks hes lucky because Ive such a great technical background with my diving from such a young age, theres not really any position that I cant do. I certainly do prefer the multiple twist dives than the somersault dives, but thats just good for me that a little bit of somersault and a lot of twist is the highest Degree of Difficulty at the moment and so I am happy with the way the rules are.
Preferring front to back, inward to reverse or handstand, and being good at it, should not prevent you from strengthening other positions. Everything that puts you out of your comfort zone makes you a well-rounded diver. If you only stick to one group, youd not be furthering the sport, youd not be improving your diving.

Gotabhaya responsible for Meethotamulla disaster
A collective of civil organisations yesterday claimed that former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is responsible for Meethotamulla disaster as he was the person who took a decision to dump garbage in Meetotamulla even neglecting and violating a court decision issued on banning garbage dumping at the Meetotamulla area.
The collective addressing the media said Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is now boasting that he would have solved the Meethotamulla issue during the last two-year period of the former government.
Civil Organization Collective Co-convener Chameera Perera said Gotabhaya is now saying that he couldnt solve the Meethotamulla garbage issue as a result of political power change.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa took a decision to dump garbage in Meethotamulla in 2008. However, as a result of peoples agitations, garbage dumping in Methitamulla was banned by a court order in 2009. But with the powers vested with Gotabhaya, garbage dumping was carried out further neglecting and violating the court order, he said.
According to Perera, not only the courts decision was violated but also the people stood against it was brutally attacked by police teams lead by then DIG Anura Senanayake.
Co-convener Akalanka Hettiarachchi said a solid solution is needed for the burning issue of garbage. No temporary or half-baked solutions can solve the issue, he said. He questioned Gotabhaya whether he would have solved the garbage issue at the last two years of the former regime.
Gotabhaya is now passing the ball to others while levelling allegations on others. As the Defence Secretary, he dreamt to create a middle-class fantasy in Colombo and the Meethotamulla Garbage dump is a result of his fantasy, he said.
Hettiarachchi said politicians who obtained votes through the Meethotamulla garbage issue, should also be responsible for the disaster.
They are duty bound to stand for the people aiming to protect their lives.
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya has said he couldnt carry out the plan he implemented to solve the garbage issue as he was not given a 60 perch land by the UDA.
The UDA is also responsible for the disaster if the UDA failed to offer a 60-perch land to the Western Province Chief Minister to carry out the solution forwarded by him, Hettiarachchi said.
He said it was revealed that there was a delay in the commencement of rescue operations. According to people of the area, there were not enough vehicles for rescue operations.
The country spends millions of public funds to import luxury vehicles to politicians, even though there were not enough vehicles to rescue the victims or save their lives he claimed.
Convener of Power of Generation Organisation Chamara Nakandala said those politicians were not eager to solve the Meethotamulla garbage issue as they were in hurry to exploit the Central Bank or importing luxury vehicles for them.

Sri Lanka should use modern technology to construct express ways without creating environmental hazards in the country, SLFP Youth Front Chairman and former Parliamentarian Shantha Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
He said expressways should be constructed on concrete columns. The Central Express Way from Colombo to Kandy and many others are to be constructed in due course. If the modern technology is not used, the country would become a desert soon, Bandara said.
Bandara said the Country is still using old technology to construct express ways. He said paddy fields and marsh lands were filled with the soil excavated from mountains that resulted in environmental hazards.

The wildlife officer had opened fire at the she elephant during an attempt to rescue four wild elephants including the she elephant fallen into a farm well at the Kombuwaiththakulam in Omanthai, Vavuniya recently. Perera urged Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera to take prompt action to conduct an impartial investigation into the shooting. Perera asked why the wildlife officers used live bullets instead of anaesthesia or rubber bullets. Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera has ordered full scale investigation into the death of the she elephant.

Another 159 houses risk-prone
The National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) yesterday said that they have identified at least another 159 houses as risk-prone in the Meetotamulla area, where a 300-foot garbage mountain collapsed burying more than 30 people and a large number of homes last Friday.
NBRO Media Spokesman R.M.S.Bandara said the immediate vicinity of the garbage mountain remained an active zone and there were a likelihood of it further collapsing if the weight and the stress on the dump keep enhancing.
According to NBRO findings, the subsurface below the dump has several different soil layers. Prominent among them is a peat layer which is above a hard soil layer. Subsequent to heavy rains, rain water penetrated into the waste pile and the additional load caused by the infiltration of rain water in to the garbage mass may have caused the instability in soft soil underneath, resulting a deep seated failure in the garbage fill.
This resulted in a lateral movement of the peat layer in the direction of houses and the significant ground up heaving has taken place at the toe region and houses situated there were severely damaged.
There is still a possibility reactivating of such movement and with heavy rains, a similar situation can occur again. Therefore, people are advised to be cautious and keep away from danger zone.
Meanwhile, military authorities said those in the danger zone of the garbage mountain have been evacuated to safe shelters. Bandara meanwhile said that the NBRO believes at least 80 houses were completely destroyed due to the collapse of the garbage mountain after analyzing satellite images taken about one month back.
However, he said that the NBRO does not possess details whether any new structures had come up in the recent past in the area. When questioned whether these were unauthorised structures he noted that the NBRO did not have such details and it was upto those who administrated the district and the province.
Bandara further noted that the NBRO will come up with a detailed map of the danger zone surrounding the Meetotamulla garbage mountain today.
The NBRO stated that the disastrous slope failure occurred at the municipal solid waste disposal site at Pothuwilkumbura, Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa at about 2.45 p.m. on April 14.
NBRO staff conducted a ground survey and a drone survey to assess the impacts. These surveys are still continued in order to identify impact zones.

Antidote to self-harshness and resentment
There are two poisons that have hurt me so much over the years: Self-harshness  I have so often been critical of myself, harsh on myself, about all my little failures, that this harshness has become one of the biggest things holding me back.Resentment  Ive increasingly become aware of how I have a mental pattern of resentment that hurts my relationships, especially with my loved ones. They dont behave the way I want, so I notice myself feeling resentful that they couldnt do things differently.
The truth is, these are the biggest problems for most of us. We dont love ourselves the way we are. We dont love others the way they are. And the harshness that results is painful and harmful to us and the people we love most.
How do we deal with these two poisons
Theres a simple antidote. Its not easy, but its pretty simple.
Its a habit of loving that which we normally dislike.
In fact, this small habit can transform all of our problems.
Imagine for a moment that youve been procrastinating (I know, a stretch, just go with it). Youre running from something that makes you uncomfortable, and you go to your favorite distraction instead. What if, instead of running from the discomfort and uncertainty  you gave them some love You wouldnt have to run. Youd face the uncertainty with love, and just work in the midst of it. (Btw, I have a course on reprogramming procrastination going on right now, join my Sea Change Program to practice with me.)
Imagine that you have anxiety about something coming up (lets say a presentation). Youre afraid of the presentation, because you have uncertainty about how youll do. You want to get away from this uncertainty. What if you practice loving this uncertainty You might not feel so anxious. What if you gave some of that good love to your feelings of anxiety as well You wouldnt be harsh on yourself about being anxious.
Its easier said than done, of course. So how do you get better at it Practice.
Antidote Practice
Heres how to work with this practice:
Imagine a good friend or loved one, someone who you can love whole-heartedly with ease. Send this person some love right now. Wish for them to be happy. Love them just as they are, in all their wonder. Now heres the important part: notice where in your body you feel this love. This is your Love Muscle (its not dirty, get your mind out of the gutter). Practice some more, so that you can call up this feeling of love, from your Love Muscle, at will.
Now turn your Love Muscle onto something about yourself. Notice something about yourself that you like. Work the Love Muscle, and love this thing about yourself.
Practice on something you dont like. Now try turning the Love Muscle onto something about yourself that youre usually not fond of. You know how to use the Love Muscle by now, so give it a shot. How can you love this thing about yourself just as it is Imagine a good friend who is having a hard time, who is flawed  can you love that good friend Can you produce the same feeling of love about this part of yourself Try it with different parts of yourself, both physical parts and mental/emotional parts of you.
Practice on other people. Notice things about other people that you like. Send love to these things. Now notice things that you dont like. Send love to these things as well. Practice on people all day long.
Practice when you feel resentment. When you notice yourself resenting something about another person, or resenting their behavior  send love to this part of the person. Love them as they are. Exercise your Love Muscle. Send love to the part of you that was feeling frustration or resentment.
Practice when youre feeling harsh on yourself. Whenever you notice yourself disliking something about yourself, send love to this thing about yourself. Send love to the part of you that dislikes the other part.
Basically, you can practice all the time. Over and over, reminding yourself and practicing.
You can practice on everything: When you have been lazy or procrastinated, notice the feeling of harshness or disappointment that comes up in yourself. Give this feeling your full attention, and all of your love.When you eat too much, or eat junk food, notice the feeling of pleasure but also guilt. Give both these feelings your love.When you are interacting with someone and they annoy you, notice the annoyance. Give some loving to this feeling of annoyance, and to the person who is annoying you.When youve been distracted all day, maybe feeling a bit anxious  notice the feelings of being distracted, of rushing, of anxiety. Love these feelings with all your heart.
When you notice your heart shutting down to someone, or to some experience, notice what it feels like when your heart starts to shut down. Love this feeling of shutting down, and love the thing youre shutting down to.When youre meditating and feeling like youre not good at it, notice what not being good at it feels like. Turn to that experience and give it some love. Love the part of you that is attempting this at all.
And so on. Every experience, every feeling, every person, every aspect of life  you can love it as the Dalai Lama would, as Jesus would, as the biggest-hearted Goddess of Love would. You are practicing loving life itself. And thats something worth falling in love with. - Zen Habits

Book Review: Narrative of an exceptional queen
Title : Rejina
Author : Mohan Raj Madawala
I pen these words in the first flush of the impression I got from reading the novel Regina.-To be exact in translation ,the queen. Longinus , an ancient Roman critic had said that a good piece of writing could be recognized when the reader feels elated on reading the creation. He would retain the feeling and it would serve as reflection for further thought in future. Prior to the beginning of his creation Madawala quotes from historical sources ,what one could find on the chief character of his novel  Queen Anula, from Sri Lankan historiography. Anula, the queen who reigned Sri Lanka , in history famously as well as infamously!! ( In relation to certain incidents in relation to some sources.)
The incidents related in connection with her had been so controversial that they had instigated many speculations in the imaginations of respective writers. They had exercised their imagination ,creating, exaggerating and most often being often self consciously judgmental.
The phenomenon has been such that when one refers to the queen in Sri Lankan History it is Anula that comes automatically to ones mind , in spite of other devis having ruled the country in history.
Selection of Anula devi to be the centre of his creation may have been also due to the fact that, she had been a different women in the cultural and social context of the back drop. (The fact that she had been exceptional)
The novelist in his work had become a creator as well. He had planted his feet firmly on the reality of history, yet had been bold enough to fantasize. The effort allows him to merge the marvelous with the magical in an atmosphere of legendary allusion. The incidents that flow one after another makes the reader slide down with the fascination of nothing other than reality. Hence he would be a participant which surpasses the boundaries of limits.
Facts and imagination seem to fuse with a humane understanding and sympathy , even to the extent of challenging age old norms and traditions. One is led to observe the serious message of promoting harmony , within and the social context of racial conflict. It propagates an insightful understanding , if the reader is willing to open up in reception. The willful destruction of artificially imposed marginalization is in fact what underlies the saga.
The manner in which the Queen is treated throughout is interesting. One may ask oneself  had circumstances made her a feminine feminist The author makes one realize the the extent and gravity of what fate plus man had made her experience. The story is also about how she faced the various situations and how she found solutions to each problem. In building up her character one is given a glimpse of how a womans mind would react in extreme circumstances. And Queen Anula was no ordinary woman. Rejection, sexual humiliation, subjugation of love, betrayal ,exploitation and subjugation were some that she was made to undergo. Finally, lonely at the top, it was pathetic that her only confidants were the fish in the royal pond. Hence the question one may ask oneself is the extent of fairness to estimate her actions as purely results of lust.
When reading Rejina, one feels like reading the ancient Greek historian Herodotus or Homer, the great poet who wrote The Iliad. The writer seems to move from one sphere to another with so much fluidity that the reader may recognize the transition. The reader would participate in the marvelous. Such an incident is the conversations she had with the fish in the pond. Though there is a feeling of fairy tale fantasy involved is it not also deep human psychology How many of us ,in the modern day talked our woes with our dogs or cats in desperate situations of isolation The humane humanness that the author makes one feels is proven at the shock or the tragic shudder one is made to experience when the invading army had made piles of bones from the talking fish, who were her ultimate allies.
If an estimation of the language that is used, one is bound to notice the flexible fluidity in the style of expression and composition. It has been the custom among Sri Lankan novelists who recreate the past in their creations to adhere to probable language that they presume to have been used at the period. Though this method might be historically and linguistically correct, the reader might feel the text somewhat strained and artificial. Excuse me if I am wrong, but the basic appeal in a novel is that it should be appealing and readable to the reader. One had to be mindful at not posing a riddle in camouflage of a novel. The language that has been a vehicle through the novelist had expressed his imaginative creativity.

Bus attack leaves Dortmund fighting blood, sweat and tears battle
Dortmund: Marc Bartra gave blood, other Borussia Dortmund players have nightmares about the bomb attack on their bus and now the German team may need the sweat of Marco Reus to pull off a fairy tale place in the Champions League last four.
The scars left by three bombs that scorched the side of the bus and fired metal shards inside before the quarter-final against Monaco have gone much further than Bartra's fractured wrist.
The game was postponed but Dortmund were forced to play 24 hours later. The shock was apparent in the 3-2 defeat that has left the German side facing a stiff challenge in Wednesday's return leg.
So far nobody has been caught -- one Islamist suspect was discounted -- and no claim of responsibility has proved convincing.
"I wake up every night," Dortmund's Swiss goalkeeper Roman Burki said. "Without any reason, I am jolted awake in terror. Then I can't get back to sleep and I am just relieved I am at home in my own bed."
Burki recalled the horror of the "huge bang" in an interview with Swiss newspaper Der Bund.
"The pressure made all our heads turn to one side. Then there was a long silence and then a cry -- it was Bartra."
Burki says he cannot understand why a football team would be the target of "a terror attack."
Dortmund are getting help from psychologists. "We have very good counsellors we can ask for help," said the goalkeeper.
And the team bounced back with a 3-1 Bundesliga win over Eintracht Frankfurt on Saturday. But getting over the attack will be a slow process.
For Brki, football is a key part of the therapy. "I'm happy to have something I can focus on. It is very important to be able to take your mind off things, think less about what has happened."
The team gathered to hold up a Bartra jersey after Saturday's win. Many of them were in tears.
"During the 90 minutes of the game it was easier. But at the end, everything you have kept inside under pressure comes out," said captain Marcel Schmelzer.
"Against Frankfurt we showed a lot of joy playing because we are happy to be here. We talk a lot about it to each other. I think it will weld us together as a team," the skipper added.
German international Sven Bender said the whole team deserved praise for playing against Frankfurt so soon after the near miss that experts said could have been deadly.
"For me, it was even harder than Wednesday, because we had more time to think about the terrible things which have happened," he said.
Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel believes the first game against Monaco should not have gone ahead so soon. But he has had to concentrate on Wednesday's return.
Some specialists say the players' shock should start to "stablise" after two or three days, according to Tuchel.
"For the players, its easier when they play, than after the whistle when they feel they have to talk" about their ordeal.
The problem is "how to focus" on the Monaco game, said the German coach.
But Saturday's display indicated Frankfurt could be in the mood for an upset in Monaco.
Defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos scored from a screaming 23 metre shot that he labelled "the most beautiful goal of my career" and dedicated it to Bartra.
And then there was Reus, who scored just 122 seconds into his comeback from six weeks on the sidelines with a hamstring injury.
Reus at his best can be a match-winner. The 27-year-old forward has the experience, the playmaking skills and above all, he was not on the ill-fated team bus last Tuesday -- and that could make all the difference. AFP

Businessman further remanded till May 2
Businessman Nandana Priyantha Perera, a spare parts supplier to Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB), was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till May 2 by Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky
He was accused of cheating and misappropriating Rs. 125 million of public funds when purchasing a stock of leaf springs to the SLTB between 2010 and 2012.
SLTB former Chairman Shashi Welgama, who was also arrested over the incident, is currently out on bail.
At a previous occasion, the Court refused to grant bail to the businessman citing there are no exceptional circumstances to release him on bail.
A revision application filed by the businessman challenging the Magistrates court order to refuse bail is to be taken up before the Colombo High Court on April 28.
On December 20, 2016, Shashi Welgama and Nandana Priyantha Perera, the owner of Nandana Auto Products Co. Limited, were arrested by the CID regarding an investigation into a financial fraud said to have taken place when purchasing leaf springs to the SLTB.
The CID had informed Court that the SLTB on two occasions had paid advance payments amounting to Rs. 40 million and Rs. 166 million to Perera to provide leaf springs to the SLTB. The CID further alleged that the suspect had supplied the leaf springs to the SLTB with a deficiency amounted Rs. 24 million and Rs. 101 million.
The CID further alleged that the former SLTB Chairman had authorised the financial transactions acting in his capacity as the then SLTB chairman. The CID further informed Court that original documents pertaining to this fraudulent transaction had been destroyed by the previous administration and a complaint regarding the incident had been made by present SLTB Chairman Ramal Siriwardena. The suspects are charged under the Public Property Act.

CERT/CC warns of Ransomware
The Sri Lanka Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERTC) yesterday warned about a new computer malware called Ransomware.
The new malware installs covertly on a victims device (e.g., computer, smartphone, wearable device) and either mounts the cryptoviral extortion attack from cryptovirology that holds the victims data hostage, or mounts a cryptovirology leakware attack that threatens to publish the victims data, until a ransom is paid.
Simple ransomware CERTC may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, and display a message requesting payment to unlock it. More advanced malware encrypts the victims files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them.
The ransomware may also encrypt the computers Master File Table (MFT) or the entire hard drive.

Champions Trophy preparations in full swing
Preparations are in full swing for the hotly contested and coveted 2017 ICC Champions Trophy taking place in England and Wales this year, with the Sri Lankan national team undertaking a six-day high intensity endurance and performance program to prepare better for the matches ahead.
National captain Angelo Mathews commenting on the preparations was appreciative of the technical and resource support from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC).
The ICC Champions Trophy will be an important event for Sri Lanka as we are going through a transition and the young but extremely talented cricketers are learning to adapt to the challenges and demands of top-level cricket, said Mathews.
I am sure this training program will provide them the experience and opportunity of acclimatization which we will find invaluable in our Champions Trophy campaign.
National Head Coach Graham Ford was confident that this young side has the talent and capacity to beat any team in the Champions Trophy and commented that all it needs is for the team to gel into a winning outfit.
Ford was also appreciative of the SLC administration stating that we lack for nothing in terms of resources. It is just about getting the mind set right now.
Manager Cricket and selector, Asanka Gurusinha said that the climatic conditions in Kandy and Diyatalawa where the team will spend time in altitude training will simulate the conditions the players will play under when they are in England. This is in addition to the best of facilities which are on offer in Kandy.
The team will also leave eight days early to England where they will play two warm-up matches against Scotland which the management of Sri Lanka Cricket has secured at its own cost. This initiative from SLC will go a long way in ensuring that the national team has a better feel of the pitch and conditions in the UK, said Gurusinha.
The two matches against Scotland are in addition to the other practice matches that the ICC has organized for all participating teams ahead of the Champions Trophy.

Companies will nominate teams of four managers with an accounting, finance and business related job scope. The managers will be sent a business case study. They will then present their responses on the case study in front of a team of judges before sitting for the case study exam in November.
The judges will mark each team against competitors from South East Asia, Sri Lanka, Gulf Cooperation Council states and India.

Operational since January 1 this year, the Association represents 650,000 members and students in public and management accounting. With broad reach, rigor and resources, the Association advances the reputation, employability and quality of CGMAs and accounting and finance professionals globally.
Commenting on the launch of this competition, Venkkat Ramanan, the Association's Regional Vice President for Asia Pacific, said, The Corporate Business Leaders Challenge is a completely new type of competition, combining teamwork, vocational study, and a live-judged presentation.
