Time to act
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe means business. He has read the riot act on those attempting to fan communal flames.There is certainly an undercurrent of ethno-religious tensions sweeping the southern parts of the country that, if not tackled immediately and firmly, could lead to another eruption of volcanic proportions.
Speaking to journalists at Temple Trees on Wednesday the Premier, in no uncertain terms, warned those bent on creating ethnic strife that the might of the law would be brought to bear in full force against them. He especially singled out those given to hate speech and incitement to violence targeting a particular race or religious community. He said, if necessary, the prevailing laws would be amended to deal with the troublemakers. The Cabinet he said had directed the police to deal strictly against anyone responsible for causing ethnic or religious disharmony. The Premier said no mercy will be shown to extremist elements who whip up racial hatred and communal passions. The government of President Maithripala Sirisena, he said, is committed to uphold the rule of law and would not permit the revival of ethnic strife of the type witnessed in 2014 that brought international condemnation on the country.
The Prime Minister's remarks no doubt would have been prompted by the recent incidents where some mosques and Muslim businesses had come under attack in certain parts of the country. The finger, no doubt, was directly pointed at the controversial Ven. Galagodatte Gnanasara who is presently in hiding, though in connection with an unrelated matter. The Bodu Bala Sena may have received only 27,000 votes at the last General Election but Ven Galagodatte certainly is creating waves bolstered by the wide media coverage.
We are here not advocating any media censorship, but the proposed new laws against hate speech should contain provision that places a check on the media in giving full play to racist attacks by the likes of Ven.Galagodatte. Today, it is not just the lunatic fringe among the monks but also certain media appear to be promoting division along communal lines in their reportage of events connected to the recent attacks. At least one TV anchor is given to making comments that are clearly meant to show the majority community as the aggrieved party, which, needless to say, can sway the opinion of viewers too see things differently. Such tacit promotion of communal or religious hatred too can contribute to exacerbate tensions.
Be that as it may, any move towards creating racial hatred overtly or by innuendo by whomsoever should be nipped in the bud. Enough blood has been spilled in the name of race. The country cannot afford to be dragged into the vortex of a religious conflagration that would result in dire consequences. Today, in addition to the saffron brigade, there are also elements in political garb who are trying their utmost to whip up communal tensions. Their speeches are loaded with poisonous rhetoric that is meant to sway the majority masses to view minority communities with suspicion. There are others too who openly support this brand of politics. The worst culprits are the so called nationalist organisations and movements, including Bikkhu Fronts that have sprung up recently. Leaders of these organisations often make incendiary statements that are sometime akin to a call to arms (against others races). Such organisations too should be kept in check lest their rhetoric make an impact on the impressionable folk among the majority community.
The PM's avowal to introduce new laws to deal with those inciting racial hatred bears relevance in this context. Of course there will be those who will bring in hair splitting arguments as to what constitutes hate speech. Politicians of the calibre of Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa will no doubt claim their right to free speech and would consider these laws as an infringement against their strident nationalist rhetoric.
Be that as it may, the time has come to call a halt to extremist elements having a free run to do as they please. It is clear that a political hand is at work manipulating the mischief makers to run amok. Mobilising the majority community by showing a clear threat to their existence from alien elements has been a good political strategy put into effect in the past. Apparently the same forces are at work again. The government should not make the same mistake as its predecessor in allowing anti-Muslim hatred to take a turn for the worst, resulting in the unfortunate incidents in Aluthgama, that turned the entire Muslim community against Rajapaksa. Things have not yet deteriorated to such stage where brazen attacks are been carried out against Muslim establishments by mobs led by saffron clad elements. The government should not wait for things to reach such a stage. It should act now instead of confining its warnings to mere words. Any procrastination could only embolden the racist elements to goad them into more drastic deeds. Intelligence should be beefed up to identify the miscreants who should be dealt with firmly.

Trump-Russia inquiry: Vice-President Pence hires lawyer

Vice-President Mike Pence has hired an outside lawyer to handle his response to inquiries into possible ties between President Trump's campaign and Russia.
Richard Cullen is known for representing high profile clients.
Earlier, US media reported that Donald Trump was being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller for possible obstruction of justice.
Mueller is leading an FBI inquiry into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
Reports in US media said senior intelligence officials would be interviewed on whether Trump tried to end an inquiry into his sacked National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and about the firing of FBI chief James Comey.
Trump - who has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia - said the move was the latest action in a "phony story".
"You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!"the US President tweeted.
Pence's office announced the decision to hire Cullen on Thursday. It said the vice-president had earlier interviewed several candidates.
"The vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the president's agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter," Pence's spokesman Jarrod Agen said.
Cullen is the chairman of McGuireWoods LLP law firm.
He represented high profile clients such as former US congressman Tom DeLay and Elin Nordegren, ex-wife of golfer Tiger Woods.
He was also involved into the Iran-Contra and the Watergate investigations.
Last month, President Trumphired his own lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, to handle Russia-related investigations by the FBI and US congressional committees.
Why is President Trump reportedly being investigated
The latest media reports say the obstruction of justice investigation began just days after Mr Trump fired Comey on 9 May.
Comey, who had been leading one of several Russia inquiries,testified to Congress last weekthat the president had pressured him to drop the inquiry into Flynn.
Flynn stepped down in February after failing to reveal the extent of his contacts with Sergei Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to Washington.
Comey testified under oath that Trump had told him during a private meeting: "I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."
The White House has said the president "has never asked Comey or anyone else to end any investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn".
Comey said he was "sure" Mueller was looking at whether Trump had obstructed justice.
But Comey also testified that to his knowledge the president had not tried to stop the Russia investigation.

The Minister said that a committee was appointed by him to look into the incident under the chairmanship of an individual by the name of Wijithamulla.
The committee report has been submitted to the Presidential Secretariat. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organisation undertook repairing the radar at their own cost and therefore it has been sent to United States again. The country will receive the radar in a few months after the repair.

The UNP is in turmoil at grassroots level and it is strange that the party leadership has not realised this, said Habaraduwa UNP chief organiser Chandralal Abeygunawardene.
Addressing a Jana Hamuwa held at Habaraduwa on June 13, he said UNPers who had manned polling booths for the last 22 years were in attendance at the Jana Hamuwa but as UNP organisers, they had not been able to provide jobs for them.
Abeygunawardene said five of his supporters were assaulted at Imaduwa during the Presidential Election but they were still languishing at home without jobs.
The six people who assaulted them have found employment in the Petroleum Corporation. He said even Joint Opposition supporters were gaining employment avenues today while UNP supporters were remaining unemployed today. If this trend continued, there would be a heavy explosion in the UNP rank and file soon, he said.

Welcome to Barkingham Palace
A British design company has launched the worlds most luxurious dog houses which cost as much as a staggering 170,000. The fancy handcrafted dog manors have smart technology fitted to allow owners to adjust the temperature as needed and even come with treat dispensers, televisions and a conference calling system.
Each house is split into two rooms, a living room and a bedroom, and is constructed using high quality woods, marble and aluminium.
It takes Cheshire-based design company Hecate Verona almost four months to build each dog manor from their range, which includes the Colonial Villa, Roman Imperial Mansion and Spanish Palacio.
The luxury dog properties are built with the size of the dog that will live there in mind, including having the windows positioned depending on their height to allow them a clear view of their territory.
Prices start from around 30,000, with fully-equipped and high-end models costing up to almost 170,000.
Miss Williams said dogs are considered a part of our families and as such deserved a home as grand as their owners.
She said: I started working on my dog manors after I began asking myself why a dog house shouldnt be as elegant and beautiful as its owners.
Our objective now is to create majestic and royal looking homes for dogs, while seeking to compliment the garden and surroundings it stands in.
The customers we have worked with typically have their dogs living indoors, but we see the dog manors as a way of providing their pets the comforts of indoor living while making the experience of being outside more enjoyable.
It leads to the dog enjoying being outdoors even more and staying more active, which is highly recommended by vets. Mirror

No Confidence Motion:
Governor scrutinizing affidavits:
Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray has told Northern Provincial Council (NPC) Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran to show that he enjoys majority support in the council in the wake of a No Confidence Motion against him signed by 21 NPC members. The Governor yesterday told the Daily News that he was in the process of verifying the affidavits and signatures of the petitioners who had submitted a motion of no confidence against Mr. Wigneswaran.
On Thursday, the motion with signatures of 21 NPC members was handed over to the Governor.
I will have to take my decision in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Constitution.
A group of members came to me and handed over the petition saying that they have lost confidence in the Chief Minister, Cooray told Daily News.
He added that once the veracity of the petition has been checked, he would send a letter to the NPC Chief Minister, asking that he prove his ability to command the confidence of the majority. Further action would be followed once that is done. The Governor however stated that he could not, give a definite timetable as to when such a letter would be sent to the Chief Minister.Wigneswaran is to function as the Chief Minister until then.
The petition comes in the wake of the Chief Minister asking for the resignation of NPC Education Minister T. Kurukularaja and Agriculture Minister P.Aingaranesan by yesterday over charges of corruption. A three-member committee appointed to investigate into allegations of corruption of four ministers within the NPC has recommended that these two be removed as they had found evidence of corruption. This is not the first time that talk of a no confidence against the Chief Minister has cropped up.
In January of this year, former TNA MP Suresh Premachandra alleged that a party within the TNA were planning on submitting motion of no confidence against Wigneswaran after he formed the Tamil Peoples Council.
Hartal in support of Chief Minister
 A hartal has been organised by the Tamil Peoples Council in the north today demanding the withdrawal of the No Confidence motion against Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran, political sources said. Several political and civil society organisations and a group of university lecturers are also slated to support the hartal.

Young Musicians in Concert
Celebrating its 60th anniversary, the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) turns the spotlight on the Junior Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka at its Young Musicians in Concert on July 1 at 7 pm at the Ladies College Hall. The HSBC bank will sponsor this concert for the 22nd consecutive year, supporting the SOSL to foster and promote young talent.
Renowned conductor Dushyanthi Perera will direct the programme which encompasses the Festival Polonaise Opus 12 by Johan Svendsen, Felix Mendelssohns Italian - Symphony No 4 in A Major Opus 90 in four movements, the Valse Triste from Kuolema by Jean Sibelius and for a touch of the contemporary, the Finale of the Star Wars Suite by John T Williams.
Conductor Dushy Perera and the JuniorSymphony Orchestra take a bow
The programme, begins with the magnificent grandeur of generous percussion, the outstanding feature in Norwegian composer Johan Svendsens Festival Polonaise Opus 12. The brassy pomp and pageantry of the main theme formed the ideal backdrop for the premier attended by King Oscar II of Norway and Sweden a few weeks after his coronation, while the balletic nuances at the end, does have a tinge of Tchaikovsky. Aptly titled Italian is Felix Mendelssohns Symphony No 4 in A major Opus 90 which was begun during a tour of Italy. The Symphony was composed to partly fulfil a commission by the (now Royal) Philharmonic Society of London. The ebb and flow of the composer is well infused into the transparency and fluidity of the music, with a pair of French Horns being used to set rhythm, dramatically propelling the music into major climaxes.
The JSO will then take the stage, performing the highly energetic and infectiously tuneful Jig from Holsts St. Pauls Suite. They will also perform a set of Romanian Dances by Bela Bartokin an excellent arrangement for string orchestraand follow this up with Mozarts hugely popular Divertimento in D major. The JSO will then join the SOSL for the rest of the concert.
Symphony orchestras around the world commemorate 70th anniversary of Jean Sibelius death and the SOSL and JSO play the Valse Triste or the Sad Waltz in tribute which was originally used in the play Kuolema or Death. The flute, clarinet, horns, Timpanum and strings go through an overwhelming journey of melancholy, speaking of a spectral beings, trysts , morbid gaiety and even an encounter with Death itself.
In sharp contrast to the despondency of Sibelius composition, the orchestras prowess will come together for the explosive opening credits of Star Wars, a score that has won multiple Academy, Golden Globe, Grammy and British Academy Film Awards. The rousing arrangement will feature the last of the first suite, the Throne Room & Finale, a luscious Hollywood vision of Brahms in the strings leading to the grand finale of the triumphant Star Wars theme.
The Principal Sponsor for the concert is HSBC. Tickets can be purchased online at www.tickets.lk or in person at Sarasavi Bookshop (Nugegoda and Maharagama), Tickets.lk office (Jawatte Gardens Colombo 5), Yamaha Music Center and Abans Main Showroom.

He said Arabic countries ordered banks operating in Qutar to freeze assets and bank accounts of the Qatar-linked 57 individuals and other entities.
Saudi Arabia has closed the border to Qatar which was the access way for 40 percent of the latters food requirement. He said those countries closed down the Al Jazeera which was operating from Qatar.

Asia based bank to open here  targeting real estate sector
For the first time an Asian bank is looking at opening a branch in Sri Lanka mainly to provide credit facilities for the real estate sector.
Steven Mayes, Managing Director, JLL Lanka (Pvt) Ltd said that their housing,apartment industry has picked up in Sri Lanka and this trend will continue.
There are also government regulations which allow Sri Lanka banks to lend 30% for foreigners for investments made to the apartment sector.
Sri Lankans too are obtaining credit for housing loans and this has opened up opportunities.
This is the reason that this Asian bank is looking at opening up in Sri Lanka at lower interest rates, Mayes said.
He also said that Sri Lanka outperforms neighbouring markets in terms of the numbers of approvals required to obtain building permits and register real estate and construction front projects.
Sri Lanka made its maiden appearance in JLLs biennial global survey measuring transparency within the real estate sector, and making a debut on the transparency index, with a rank of 69, was noteworthy,he said.
The 2016 report suggests this ranking is commensurate with the relative maturity of the market. As per Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), a leading index that measures economies on the basis of perceived corruption, Sri Lankas ranking has consistently improved, after its civil unrest issues were resolved.
It currently ranks 83rd on the index, up from 91 in 2013, hard on the heels of more established countries in the region, such as India.
Despite the challenges faced by the government, which include a slowdown in foreign direct investment, high government debt and currency volatility, there continues to be a concerted push towards greater development.
Consecutive governments in Sri Lanka have brought about reforms with the intention of helping the nation achieve higher long-term growth. Sri Lanka improved its Ease of Doing Business ranking from 113 in 2015 to 110 in 2017.

After reading it, Wijesinghe replied that it was a statement made by the Prime Minister and he had no knowledge whether the government had taken an official decision to implement the method.
Attorney Chanaka de Silva then stated that the Premier made the statement on March 17, 2015 and also stressed that the Central Bank was an institution which comes under the purview of the Prime Minister.

All should be aware of non-communicable diseases. People should be careful when consuming food items, Addalaichenai Ayurvedic Base Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr. K. L. M. Nakfer said.
He was speaking at the awareness programme regarding non-communicable diseases at the Addalaichenai - Konawatta area, organized by the Addalaichenai Al-Ifatha cultural organization, recently.
Dr. Nakfer said due to the lack of physical exercise, most people are diabetic, suffering from blood pressure, heart diseases and paralysis.
We should refrain from taking oily and fatty foods to prevent diseases. We suffer a lot after being affected by these diseases. Therefore, we should be cautious of our daily food intake. It will be difficult to escape these diseases once we are affected, he added.
Include about five vegetables with one fruit in the daily diet and the chances of disease are remote. The government also encourages people to take up home-gardening under the 'Divi Neguma' programme. It is essential to carry out physical exercises 30 minutes per day, five days a week, the doctor added.
He said it is important to see that proper vegetable oil is used while cooking. If the oil is used once for frying or cooking, it should not be used again.
Nowadays, women are affected by breast and womb cancer. They should be identified at the initial stage. There are clinics being conducted at M.O.H office for cancer, Dr. Nakfer added.
Eastern Province Opposition Leader M. S. Udumalebbe, Al-Ifatha Cultural Organization Vice- President A.B. Abdul Gaffoor and Management Board members also participated.

Born to discover!
The Thespians of St. Bridgets Convent has had remarkable success in the recent past due to their unwavering faith and consistency. Dramatic Moves features the girls of St. Bridgets Convent who say that they are at their best, when teamwork is at its best and prayers are strongest.
Teacher in charge,Malinthi Perera
Teacher in Charge, Malinthi Perera called drama a discovery.
St Bridgets has had a long tradition of drama and the hard work of many teachers and students has been responsible for its success. Special mention must be made of the effort of Yoland Abeyweera. But an official society was probably established under Rohini Dias and Chandrani De Silva Kulasiri around the 1980s.
Drama is not just about discovering ones talent but discovering the world. I believe that the function of drama at school is to educate our students and enable them to explore various angles of life and living. I also believe that with good team effort and the grace of God there is nothing that cannot be achieved. Students live in a challenging world today. Thus, drama is a wonderful method of instruction as well as stress relief.
We receive a lot of support from Rev Sr. Alexandra Mendis, our principal who is ever willing to encourage and advice. The students too work really hard and the seniors this year led by Saleemah have been truly wonderful to work with, said Perera.
A strong impact
President, Saleemah Mohideen is known as a talented actress who is versatile and easy to perform with. She has played main roles in several plays.
President, Saleemah Mohideen
Our drama society is very old. It has flourished and grown with each year since 2008 under Malinthi Perera. We enjoy performing a wide variety of drama in school, mainly tragedy, dramedy (dramatic comedy) and Shakespeare. The kinds of dramas we perform also depend largely on the cast we have and the kind of audience we will perform to, said Mohideen.
At Bridgets the society has grown in numbers over the past few years and there are many talented enthusiasts from all grades taking part every year.
Since everyone is welcome to join we have a wide variety of talent. Parents are mostly supportive and understand what it is like to be a thespian, but sometimes busy school schedules and other commitments prevent everyone from taking part every time, stated Mohideen. Mohideen was pointed out that the school as it stands today has quite a lot of talent and promise from the juniors in the younger grades as well as the seniors. Our achievements so far have been getting into the finals of every competition we have taken part in since 2008 except for the year 2009. Our main aim is to leave a strong impact on the audience and our biggest achievement is that we have managed to do so every time whether we have won or not.
Mohideen highlighted the fact that they came overall champions Winning Shakespeare when they took part in 2008 with (Twelfth Night) and again when they participated in 2014 (Merry Wives of Windsor.)
We came runners-up at Royal Drama Comp in the year 2015 with the suicide play Just like I Wanted. In 2016, the seniors participated in the CBB drama competition organized by the British Council and emerged Overall Champions and won the Best Director award for our production of the American War play Booby Trap.In the recently concluded Royal Drama Comp, our junior cast where students in grade 10 and below participated, managed to come runners-up with the same production of Booby Trap and also received the Best Actress award, explained Mohideen
Talent is in abundance at St Bridgets. The school has a lot of dramatists of all ages and sometimes choosing and casting plays is a difficult job as there is a lot of talent everywhere.
During my time in the drama society there have been many memorable productions but two of the most unforgettable have been our Shakespeare Competition play Merry Wives of Windsor and the CBB play Booby Trap. The learning experience, working with the cast and directors and the final performances of those two plays have been experiences that we will not be forgetting any time soon, added Mohideen.
I love to do anything which provides scope for improvement of our acting overall, and I feel that a variety of emotions, which can be found in tragicomedies, is the best. Weve done many Shakepearean plays and the one we did for the Inter school competition in 2014 (the Merry Wives of Windsor) was very memorable and was loved by the audience and judges alike, elucidated Mohideen.
Mohideen concedes that competition is tough in the drama circuit.
So far we have been able to handle it and set standards ourselves as well. Competing against both boys and girls schools in competitions like CBB is even more challenging.
There are many new concepts and ideas coming in from the girls themselves, and hopefully well be able to showcase some of them in our annual production in October, explained Mohideen. Their Principal along with Malinthi Perera has been a great strength to them.
Our Principal Rev. Sr. Alexandra Mendis has been very supportive of the drama society since 2015 and encourages us to take part in competitions, workshops and events outside school as well as our annual production. Anyone who wishes to join is welcome regardless of what they can do or how talented they are. Being a part of a society such as this helps the student to grow as a person, and as a leader, pointed out Mohideen.
The girls do a lot of character work and research, which if done properly, will help to get into character and live every aspect of that character.
As a girl, playing a male role has always been a challenge but if one is used to playing it from ones younger days then it comes naturally. Getting the posture, voice and mannerisms right is the main challenge, said Mohideen.
An important activity
Secretary Thanuri Pulasha is known to be a dependable member who is easy to perform with.
      Secretary Thanuri Pulasha
We perform tragedies, comedies, humorous plays. The strengths of our society is definitely the unity of the cast. We do have a selection of actors and actresses. Our parents are very supportive and understanding. When considering achievements, the many competitions our cast has taken part in and won, the annual productions staged, and every other activity taken part in, we consider as our achievements, said Pulasha
The faculty of our school is very understanding, and they also encourage us to take part in many activities, such as competitions, stated Pulasha
Drama according to Pulasha is vital to ones personality
The drama society helps build up confidence and teaches discipline to the members. Therefore it could be considered as an important activity for students to take part in. Being a part of the Drama Society is beneficial to all members of any age, since it instills discipline, allows a growth in confidence, and most importantly, it helps develop ones abilities in performance, whether it be acting, dancing, or any other, explained Pulasha.
The main strengths
Assistant Secretary Druvinka Waas has been a Member of the Society since the age of 11 where she acted as a little hedgehog. She has also participated in every production since then. She is a flexible actress and easily directed.

Assistant Secretary Druvinka Waas
Over the years we've performed comedies, tragedies, classics, modern plays and everything in between. I think one of the main strengths of our drama society is the enthusiasm and passion for drama our school/ members have and their commitment and dedication towards drama. But of course none of this would be possible without the immense support and encouragement we get from our parents and our school, pointed out Waas.
In the recent past the girls have really achieved a lot.
We have gotten into the finals in every competition we have participated in since the year 2008 except once. Some of our recent achievements are winning the CBB drama competition in 2016, and the Shakespeare drama competition in 2014 as well as becoming runners up at the CBB drama competition in 2013 and the Royal Interact Drama Competition in 2015 & 2017, explained Waas.
Different genres
Co-Editor Shontaal Manuelpillai is a committed actress. The younger ones are definitely ready to take on the mantle and carry drama at St. Bridgets into the future. A recent example is the Royal Drama Competition that took place this year where are Junior cast from Grades 9 and 10 took part and were placed second. They competed against some of the leading schools in drama, said Manuelpillai
   Co-Editor Shontaal Manuelpillai
When it comes to exploring different possibilities in drama Manuelpillai pointed out that there are different genres that they would like to try out in terms of plays, but the audience needs to be considered when wanting to attempt anything new
We make sure that drama and school work do not interfere with each other and the students make sure that they are capable of balancing everything before practices begin. We take characterization extremely seriously. Even before roles are confirmed, we make sure that we know a backstory for all the characters. We characterize in a way, that we eat, breathe and sleep the lives of our characters, which has been noted and praised during numerous performances, explained Manuelpillai.
A special achievement
The Drama Society now has over a hundred students. The greatest achievement of the society we believe has been its consistency over the past few years. Since 2008, we have been selected for the finals at every competition we have participated in except one.
The 2008 win was a special achievement as we won the Shakespeare trophy after a gap of 12 years.
The focus of our society is teamwork. We feel that our best wins have always been at times when teamwork was at its best and prayers were strongest. We have achieved much with the grace of God.
Discipline also plays a big part in whatever we do. We have many strict rules, which enable such a large society to function as it does with minimum hitches. Drama helps us learn many things but most importantly, Drama is fun.
We are a society that works on a very low budget usually. We try to do as much work as possible by ourselves including making our own props.
Our teacher in charge Malinthi Perera has been a true pillar of strength to us throughout. She manages the role of a strict disciplinarian and a motherly figure very well. Our principal Rev Sr. Alexandra too has been a source of encouragement to us at all times. We can honestly say that we could not have achieved everything we did without her support.

CEBs low cost generation plan comes under fire
The Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan (LCLTGP) 2018-2037 proposed by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) came under strong scrutiny at its public consultations yesterday as the government body, Strategic Enterprise Management (SEMA) stated that the Plan was not in line with the policy of the government.
The President has made it clear that the government is aiming at 60 percent of the energy mix to be renewables by 2020 and 70 percent by 2030. How can we achieve this if the CEBs plan only speaks of 35 percent renewable by 2030 and 31 percent by 2037, asked SEMA Chairman, Ashoka Abeygunawardana making his submission on the report at BMICH yesterday.
The CEBs Plan does not agree with the policy of the government. They have considered renewables as a burden and set a quota for renewables as an afterthought, he added as he stressed that the governments policy had no place for more coal power plants despite the CEB insisting on it, Abeygunawardana said.
He stressed that the CEB needed to take into consideration climate change challenges when proposing their energy mix.
According to CEB statistics wind power is the cheapest but they say it is not optimal as it cannot be stored. When storage costs are added to renewables, their costs are higher than that of coal. But they have not taken into account the cost of building pump storage plants for coal. There are problems with these numbers, alleged Abeygunawardana.
The CEB in the meantime is faced with its own challenges of trying to ensure a stable power supply in the near future and to avoid a possible power crisis soon if they do not get to implement the LCLTGEP. The LCLTGEP states that Sri Lanka recorded a 2353MW of maximum demand in 2016 while generating a total of 14250GWh. The generation demand is expected to grow 5.9 percent per annum from 2018-2022.
They also stress that the grid should have an installed capacity of 4269MW by the beginning of 2018 and 10783 MW by the end of 2037. Their proposed energy mix for the next 20 years consists of major hydro, coal, pump storage hydro, combined cycle, oil and gas turbines.
In addition by 2018, they plan to add 15MW of mini hydro power, 160MW of solar power 5MW of biomass, 320MW of oil based power to the nation grid by 2018.
The Plan would also require an investment of USD 14.568 billion in the next 20 years to be fully implemented. They also observe that if 2938MW of renewable energy capacity is developed, this could avoid the construction of 900MW coal power. The CEB has noted that coal as base power would be more reliable and cheaper than renewables at present but would amend their mix as technology for renewables improves.
The presence of coal in the Plan however has made it difficult for the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) to approve it. The PUCSL has asked that the CEB to re-submit their report in line with government policy but then they return with the same thing. In the meantime, we just waste time and neither coal nor renewable energy power plants are made. And as a result we build more and more diesel power plants as a temporary measure. I suspect the oil mafia to be behind this, said Abeygunawardana.
He asked that the CEB alone not be allowed to make the plan and that the PUCSL get the assistance of economists, sociologists and environmentalists to make a better plan.
The CEB is to take into account the public consultations and resubmit the plan by 7 July, said PUCSL Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe and thereafter they would announce their decision on the plan on July 20.
The CEB cannot implement the Plan without the approval of the PUCSL and delays will further exacerbate the power crisis.

CIM Sri Lankas inaugural Teachers Forum envisions education in New Age
The Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM) Sri Lanka held its first Teachers Forum titled The New Age Education with the objective of highlighting the challenges associated with school education.
Participating at this thought-provoking event was a large gathering of teachers from the countrys leading national, international and private schools.
The forum comprised an exciting roster of experts and leaders in education who helped stimulate vibrant discussions.
Drawing from her experience internationally as well as her wide ranging understanding of the local education system, Nicola Walsh, Inspector to the Government of the United Kingdom spoke on the importance of providing effective feedback.
She said, Positive feedback - as in what you do, say and write influences the performance of the children. Research shows positive feedback has high impact with minimal cost.
She encouraged teachers to devote time for students to talk  collaborative working  setting work to match ability which helps children feel challenged.
Dr. Udena Attygalle, Consultant Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist, addressed the gathering on 'The common mental health issues in children and adolescents and how it impacts education'.
Dr. Attygalle said,A child is a developing being, learning in several domains such as cognitive, physical and academic. Mental health issues are simply a label but what is needed is to understand the child.
When working with children we need to be non-judgmental especially working with mental health issues. Most mental health issues manifest as behavioural problems in children and we need to understand what is going on in their world.
The next speaker, Hasini Gunasekera, Course Director, International Academy of Beauticians (Pvt) Ltd., discussed areas on the importance of image building and personality development.
She said, Appearance is a communication tool which tells others about your profession, professionalism, level of sophistication and credibility.
Instructing on How image can add value to your life she said, You need to take certain initiatives to project yourself in the same form you would like others to perceive you. So just like a personal brand is built - how others see you and how you see yourself.
Reiterating the role of CIM Sri Lanka, Onalie Dissanayake, CIM SL Educational Services Manager said, As an educational institute we would be delighted to assist the teachers and principals to improve our future generation through career guidance, motivational sessions, etc. Our professional members with wide range of experiences are willing to support to improve and develop the students of our country. We conduct these programmes free of charge to schools on their request.

## Title: consequences of not  liberalizing  tea imports
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance
## Date: Friday, June 16, 2017 - 01:00
consequences of not  liberalizing  tea imports
The proposal for liberalization of tea imports has been debated for over 15 years without any decision.
The Tea Exporters Association Sri Lanka(TEA) requests for liberalization was included in the 2016 government budget approved by Parliament. However, it was not implemented due to strong objections from some stakeholder members.
Last year, two international tea brands namely Tetley and Ahmad submitted proposals to establish tea packing plants in Sri Lanka as BOI projects.
As per the information given to the subcommittee appointed for evaluation of the two proposals, the two companies were planning to invest US$ 70 million each and provide employment opportunities for about 700 people.
Only the TEA representative at the committee supported the proposals as it believes in the positive contribution that would accrue to the tea industry and economy with the presence of two international tea brands in the country.
However, these two proposals were also not approved by the government due to objection from the same stakeholder members.
The Tea Exporters Association would like to highlight below the consequences of not liberalizing tea imports to the countrys economy.

1. Tea production in Sri Lanka, during the last ten years has been on a declining trend compared to other major tea producing countries. Sri Lankas share in world tea production has now come down to 6.5 %.
Since re-planting is not taking place at the required level of 2-3 % of the tea land extent per annum, tea production will continue to be comparatively low against the other tea producing countries.
As a result, the growth of the tea exports sector would be restricted by the limited availability of tea in Sri Lanka.
2. If Sri Lanka maintained an annual growth rate of 3% during the last decade, the tea production would have exceeded 400 million kg by now.
The loss of export opportunities is estimated at around 75 million kg per year. If this volume is converted into value at US$ 5 per kg, the country is losing around US$ 375 million annually.
The liberalization of tea imports could have covered this shortfall in the supply side and increased the available tea quantity for export.
3. Sri Lanka is losing market share in many countries due to the decline in tea production and the high price of Ceylon Tea.
These markets are being captured by our competitors  India, Vietnam and Kenya, etc. Once a market is lost, it will be extremely difficult to regain that market.
Further, the increase in CTC tea production poses a strong threat to Sri Lankas orthodox tea market share in some of our traditional markets.
Kenya with an annual tea production of over 470 million kg has already entered into the traditional Iran market earlier dominated by Ceylon Tea.
4. The constraints in the tea production front have led to an increase in the cost of production in the country. Although the prices at the Colombo tea auction are comparatively higher than other auction centres, exporters find it difficult to compete with other international brands which are offered at much more competitive prices.
Hence, the growth of Sri Lankan owned tea brands is restricted due to the high cost of production in the country.
5. Some exporters are unable to cater to certain market segments due to the non-availability of suitable types of tea locally, which has a negative impact on the growth of brands. In most markets the importance of origin of tea is gradually phasing out to the strength of brands.
6. The permission granted for import of CTC, Green and Specialty teas under the 1981 Sri Lanka Tea Board Regulations for value addition and re-exports have enhanced the value proposition of export of tea in bags and other consumer packages and their FOB prices are much higher than the prices of other categories.
This scheme has in fact helped to get better prices for locally made CTC and Green Teas as well. It should be noted here that in the 14 years period from 1981  1995 where orthodox tea was allowed to be imported without restriction for value addition and re-exports, there was no adverse effect on local tea producers.
The authorities should have considered allowing certain selected orthodox tea grades under the same scheme for value addition and re-export until a long term decision on liberalization of tea import is taken. A scheme can be designed to make sure that tea importation will not affect the demand for local tea.
7. The protection given to tea producers/manufactures does not expose them to real competition. Under the circumstances, some producers may not make any serious effort to improve tea quality, reduce COP and improve management efficiency.
They will continue to depend on government protection and subsidies that would be a burden on the entire economy.
8. A number of international and local tea brands have already moved out from Sri Lanka due to the current policy and the country has lost a substantial amount of foreign exchange, capital investment and employment opportunities.
More Sri Lankan tea brands will consider shifting their operations to places like Dubai under the current system. The liberal trade policies adopted in Germany and Dubai have helped these countries to capture a substantial share of world tea exports without producing any tea.
9. The plans to regain some lost markets such as Egypt and Pakistan will not be successful as Sri Lanka is unable to offer competitively priced tea to these markets under the prevailing system.
10. Sri Lanka will not be able to expand their business to more secure Europe or USA markets without having the right type of tea mix at competitive prices. The retail sale segment in these countries is controlled by hypermarkets/supermarkets and they maintain the retail prices without any change for 6-12 months.
The high cost of production in Sri Lanka does not allow Sri Lankan tea brands to get into the mass market segment controlled by super market chains.
11. If liberalization of tea imports was allowed, the service sector including banking, insurance, warehousing and transportation, etc., could have expanded providing more employment opportunities.
However, this has been prevented due to non-liberalization of tea imports.
12. The Sri Lankan tea brands that exclusively market the Pure Ceylon Tea concept account for less than 10% of the countrys annual tea export volume and their growth in terms of volume remains static. These brands are unable to drive the tea industry to achieve the expected growth due to comparatively low volumes. The world market share of single origin tea is insignificant and it is unlikely that this share would increase.
13. Sri Lanka will not be able to achieve the tea export revenue targets set for 2020 as the growth of the sector is curtailed due to non availability of adequate volumes and the right mix of tea to cater to many international market segments.

A country should be devoid of communal divisions and clashes to achieve sustainable development, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Badulla kachcheri to mark the distribution of a stock of festival equipment valued at Rs 1.5 million among mosques and Muslim welfare societies in Badulla on Wednesday.
Minister de Silva said Sri Lankans should learn lessons from the war and the terrorist problem which engulfed the country for nearly 30 years.
The development and progress of the country retrograded by about 50 years owing to the war. The setback had affected the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities equally. Political leaders should never foster communal or religious divisions for short term political gain.
He said that the Yahapalana government was acting in a responsible manner to foster harmony and reconciliation among communities.
Referring to talks about harassment towards Muslims in the country, Minister de Silva said the government never condoned such actions. The President and the government condemned such irresponsible actions, he said.
He said Badulla had achieved considerable development and progress in recent years as all politicians in the district worked in unity.
He said the country never forgot the services rendered by past Muslim leaders such as Siddilebbe and T. B. Jayah who joined Sinhala leaders in the countrys independence struggle. Late Minister Badi-ud-din Mahmud had rendered an enormous service towards the development of education.

Daimler lays foundation for one of world's most modern battery factories
By laying the foundation for one of the biggest and most modern battery factories, Daimler AG is setting new standards in the international automotive industry, thereby taking the next strategic step in its electric offensive.
At the wholly-owned subsidiary Accumotive in Kamenz, Saxony, Germany, the second factory for lithium-ion batteries is built with an investment of around Euro 500 million.
Guests of honour at the ceremony were Federal Chancellor Dr. Angela Merkel and Stanislaw Tillich (Minister President of Saxony), who, together with Dieter Zetsche (Chairman of the Board of Daimler AG and Head of Mercedes-Benz Cars) laid the casing of a vehicle battery as the foundation stone.
The automotive industry is facing a fundamental transformation and we see ourselves as the driving force behind this change, says Dieter Zetsche.
The battery factory in Kamenz is an important component in the implementation of our electric offensive. By 2022, we will have more than ten purely electric passenger cars in series.
We also continue to drive forward the hybridization of our fleet.
The investment of Daimler strengthens the region as a major innovation hub for the German automotive industry and offers employees good prospects in a future-oriented technology field.
The German Chancellors visit at Accumotive underlines the importance of electric mobility in Germany.
The second battery factory has been designed as a CO2-neutral factory with an energy balance of zero: Daimlers approach to electric mobility is an integrated one, attaching key importance to sustainability already at the production stage.
With state-of-the-art facilities and technologies, the new battery factory will also set standards regarding Industry 4.0.
With the Concept EQ, Mercedes-Benz is presenting a new generation of electric vehicles. More than ten new electric passenger cars are scheduled to be launched by 2022: in all segments from smart to large SUVs.
Ten billion euros will be invested in the expansion of the electric fleet in the next few years.
The new electric vehicles will be produced within the global, highly flexible and efficient production network of Mercedes-Benz cars with plants on four continents. The first EQ series model will roll off the line at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Bremen at the end of the decade. In addition to that, luxury-class EQ models will be produced at the plant in Sindelfingen.
The company assumes that the proportion of electric vehicles in the total unit sales of Mercedes-Benz will be between 15 and 25 percent by 2025.
In addition to traction batteries, Accumotive will produce batteries for Mercedes-Benz energy storage units and 48-volt-systems.
The pioneering 48-volt on-board power supply is celebrating its premiere in the new generation of the S-Class and will be gradually introduced in various model series.
Diesel & Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) is the only authorized distributor for Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Sri Lanka for more than seven decades.
The new Mercedes-Benz Centre  DIMO 800 is the most modern and the largest service centre in the region.

Do not fear Diaspora: Radhakrishnan
State Education Minister V.Radhakrishnan said some politicians are trying to form a psychoneurosis in the country over the Diaspora.
But, the minister said, to have such a hang-up would be stupidity because people who they call the Diaspora are a section of people from this country who have settled in foreign lands.
Therefore, there is no need to have any fear over the Diaspora- or the people of your own who are living abroad, he said.
For example, Shabheshan Welayudan, a man lived in Jaffna who left the country for England during 1983 riots, having done well in that country, came Monday to Sri Lanka and offered help to some 1,200 children affected by the recent floods in the Yagama Ratnapura area, Radhakrishnan said .
Welayudan distributed supplies worth Rs 1.2 million among these children because he thinks as a Sri Lankan, he pointed out.
We have to advocate cordial relations with the Diaspora, instead of creating a phobia over them in the minds of the public, he said.We have to embrace their goodwill support in order to progress as a country, added Radhakrishnan.

Donor conference on Sri Lanka soon
Special Assignment Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said the Government has planned to hold a donor conference with immediate effect aiming to fulfill financial needs and finding a permanent solution to the flood problem.
He was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
The Minister said the idea of holding the donor conference was mooted by the President at the recent Cabinet meeting aiming to find a lasting solution to the damage and destruction caused by floods and landslides in a few districts from time to time, including the Ratnapura, Kalutara and Galle districts.
The venue of the donor conference has not been finalised as yet and it could be held here or abroad.
A three member committee has been appointed by the President in this regard. Accordingly, Finance Minister Mangala Sameraweera, Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama were appointed to the committee.
The committee will submit proposals to the donor conference, where the proposals will be considered by the donor countries.
The project proposals, which was prepared on a district or electoral base, provide permanent suggestions to control floods. The aid may be either financial or technological. Flood disasters cannot be mitigated only by giving flood relief as there should be a long lasting solution to it he said. The Minister added that according to rough estimates, a sum of US $ 300 million will be needed for the proposed flood control project of Kalu Ganga.
Under the proposed Kalu Gamga project, three dams are constructed at Malwala, Dela in the Ratnapura district. Besides, a few separate proposals will be introduced to control floods in other districts based on the Nilwala Ganga and Kalu Ganga, he said.
Asked when the donor conference be held, the Minister said that it has been planned to be held immediately,most probably within two months.

Douse inflammable material in politics
Disturbing news began to flow in from the suburbs and from the periphery. It was about attacks on properties and places of religious worship of the Muslim community and several Christian denominations.
It came at first sporadically, here and there. Later, a pattern, an involvement of a hidden hand became visible. How could incidents of similar nature occur throughout such a wide geographic spread without someone orchestrating them These incidents are of such a nature that it is still a small group that is involved in these criminal activities. Yet it cannot be ignored without peril. It must not be ignored.
For nearly seven decades since independence we have failed to forge unity and harmony among all communities inhabiting our common homeland. As a result we have gone through the trauma of communal clashes which culminated in a three-decade fratricidal war. Even seven years after the end of the war we are sliding into communal disharmony.
On January 8, 2015 people of all communities began a new journey towards national unity and reconciliation with much anticipation. Yet the above incidents pose a danger of accumulated attacks and the accompanying rumour mongering and hate speech leading to a fascist type programme against Muslims such as what we experienced in Black July 83 against the Tamils.
Independence struggle
Sri Lanka belongs to all its citizens irrespective of their racial, religious, class or other divisions. All of them have no other land to call their own. They are not welcome as citizens elsewhere, except for a few who would for economic or other reasons wish to and have access to settle down in countries that welcome immigrants.
Muslim community has lived in this land for centuries, mostly interspersed with the Sinhala and Tamil communities. They have participated with honour in the independence struggle against foreign domination and have contributed substantially to the economy of the country. None could also forget their commitment to the security and unity of the country. Moreover, they have sought relief to whatever grievances they have through peaceful negotiations, displaying extreme patience.
Fortunately majority of the Sinhala Buddhists are not yet infested with the virus of anti-Muslim sentiments and hatred. It is only the racist and religious fundamentalist groups that are trying to spread such sentiments and provoke a clash.
There is also no doubt that politicians with an eye to the future elections are trying to encourage and use such organisations as the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) as a lever to grab power even at the cost of much bloodshed. The patronage of a section of the Maha Sangha and minor political parties also has to be counted.
It is also evident that the so-called patriotic hysterical campaign of emphasizing the Sinhala-Buddhist hegemony promoted during the war years, especially by the former Government with falsification of history has left much more than a trace of communalism in the minds of the majority community.
Sinhala youth
One could also recall the fantastic and unfounded claims by a popular monk, especially among the Sinhala youth inculcating in them a fear that the faster growth rate among the Muslims would reduce the Sinhala population to a minority in the future. The Sinhala people constitute almost 75 percent of the total population and the Muslims even at most liberal estimates are still less than 10 percent. The fearful scenario that is being predicted by the above propagandists will not be statistically (scientifically) and practically feasible even after several hundred years. Those having patience could work out the mathematics of relative growth of the populations of the two communities. It is most unfortunate that monks who represent the followers of a great teacher of great compassion or maha karuna would resort to such baseless slander.
One could also discern the hand of trading interests in the sporadic attacks against commercial establishments run by Muslims. Actually it is the right to life of these victims that is denied by the goons conducting such attacks. Forgotten also is the fact such attacks also leave far more bigger segments of the Sinhala Buddhist population also victims, through loss of their means of livelihood.
The media too, knowingly or unknowingly have become a vehicle transmitting communal propaganda. More dangerous is its practice of not reporting acts of criminal sabotage conducted by BBS goons so that the public remains ignorant of what happens.
In this situation it is necessary to do everything possible to stop these incidents that provoke communal unrest and may even lead to a pogrom targeting the Muslims and minor religious denominations of Christians. The onus is on both the Government and civil society to do so. The public of all communities, including the Sinhala Buddhists are not communal minded. It is groups with vested economic or political interests that are trying to ignite communal clashes.
Firstly, it is necessary to make people aware of the danger of communal unrest and the magnitude of such danger. Communal unrest would dissipate the hard-won relative peace and reconciliation that already exists after the fall of the former regime. It is already waning. It would destabilize the country and investors would not come. Economic development would be adversely affected and the standard of living of the masses would deteriorate quickly. Human rights situation in the country would be seriously damaged leading to the loss of the good name the country enjoys at present. Sri Lanka would again become a pariah state with archaic tribal clashes which are anachronistic in this 21st Century.
Secondly, the Government must resolutely act against provocateurs applying the law of the land without vacillation. At this moment it is the inaction on the part of the Government and its leaders including those at the very top that has encouraged the saboteurs including the BBS leader Gnanasara Thera who so brazenly breaks the law. Those who are shielding him physically or morally are also offenders.
The public is also perturbed by the discriminatory manner in which the law is interpreted by judicial officials too. Ambiguities in such interpretation should be abolished according to suitable legislative or legal means.
If one recalls history it would be easy to understand how the suppression of agitation demanding redress to their grievances led to the overthrow of the moderate and mature leadership in the struggle for winning democratic rights of the Sri Lankan Tamils.
Continued impunity enjoyed by BBS goons and others of their ilk in various pocket organisations would lead to frustration among Muslim youth who would rise up ousting their own mature leadership just like the rise of various militant groups among the Tamil youth in the 1980s. Unlike those days the external climate today is more volatile with the presence of numerous terrorist and fundamentalists outfits such as the ISIS, the Taleban etc. who are seeking to enter Sri Lanka given an opportunity. They have vast funds and state agencies far more widespread and powerful than those that supported the LTTE and similar outfits despite reservations. Also one should remember various intelligence agencies interested in spoiling the good relations Sri Lanka has with Palestine and Arab nations, could also intervene to make matters worse for us in their own national interests.
Muslim community
Solidarity actions by non-Muslim national communities, including the Sinhala community is an urgent and an imperative task at this moment. Political parties also should unitedly call for a stop to the criminal acts against the Muslim community and other minority religious groups. Unfortunately politicians on both sides of the divide seem reluctant to take up a united stand. Some JO politicians seem to act as God Fathers to the vandals involved in arson and other crimes. For example JO's Mahindananda Aluthgamage has given his decision regarding an act of arson in Talawakele even before any official inquiry could conclude. Even his political boss acts in a similar manner.
Even half-hearted and belated actions against some criminals by the Government show a desire to be equidistant from both the victimized community and the perpetrators who victimize them. It need not do so. It must not equate an orchestrated, widespread and developing series of attacks against the Muslim community with any action by individuals resorting to reflex counter actions spontaneously without any external assistance. Thus to arrest and detain a single Muslim youth for a purportedly offensive message in cyberspace amidst inaction against the authors of hundreds of similar and far more offensive messages against Muslims and their religion betrays the true loyalties of the State or the law enforcing authorities. (And this is happening in a country where a person who hacked the Presidents website was not only released from custody but even rewarded by the President! Even the Presidents alleged assailant was released with a public embrace!)

The Supreme Court yesterday fixed for argument, the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, for October 24.
In his petition, Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had sought Courts intervention to prevent an imminent arrest of him over several purported investigations.
On May 13, 2015 the Supreme Court issued an interim order staying the arrest of former Defense Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and granted leave to proceed in the fundamental rights petition filed by him.
However, on June 8, 2015 the Supreme Court clarified that the interim order staying the arrest of the former Defence Secretary would only apply to four incidents namely floating armoury incident, allegations of corruptions and irregularity in the purchase of MiG 27 in year 2006, Purported share manipulation at Lanka Hospitals Limited and Mihin Lanka deal and his arrest cannot be made by three respondents including the IGP, CID Director and DIG of the FCID.
However, the Supreme Court observed that this interim order would not apply for any other investigative authorities who have not been named as the respondents.
Through this petition, Rajapaksa sought the intervention of the Supreme Court to exercise the fundamental rights jurisdiction to prevent an imminent arrest of him over pending or on the conclusion of several purported investigations by the Criminal Investigations Department, Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruptions and the Frauds and Corruption Investigation Division (FCID) allegedly set up by an order which is ultra vires.
In his petition, Gotabaya Rajapaksa had cited 45 persons including the Cabinet of ministers , IGP Pujith Jayasundara and Attorney General as respondents.

He made this observation after initiating the Waters Edge expansion project yesterday.
The minister said Waters Edge is an institution under the government that proves government institutions could earn profits and run without public funds.
He said the government has had to bear the burden of the loans that the previous government obtained to show off development.
There is a view in society that the government sector can run businesses like the private sector, Minister Ranawaka said.
Waters Edge is a fine example that has proved the view as its runs and expands with its own funds, the minister said.
He said previous governments failed to pay compensation for the people for the land acquired to set up Waters Edge.
This government allocated Rs. 408 million to pay compensation to them, he said.
The minister said an Exhibition Hall will be opened at Waters Edge. It will reduce the congestion at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall. He said the number of the rooms in Waters Edge will also be increased.

Govt. violating democracy in the name of democracy: Prof. Tissa Vitharana
It seems that the United National Party (UNP) needs something similar to that of Black July in order to postpone elections. This is what stands behind the recent attacks on shops and mosques of Muslims and not arresting Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, said Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharan.
Addressing a press conference held at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the only way of postponing elections is by declaring a state of emergency which could be done only if racist violence irrupts in the country.
But it would be much more serious and dangerous than the 27 year war. Nobody listened to the LSSP in the past and as a result the 27 years long war commenced.
According to Prof. Vitharana, the Government is violating democracy in the name of democracy and doing nothing to control the development of ethnic tension. If violence irrupts in Sri Lanka, the US will definitely intervene just as it did in other countries in the world and destroy the entire country. US wants this Government to continue without any trouble in order to make use of the Trincomalee harbour.
Prof. Vitharana pointed out that there are only 100 million Tamils in the world, while 70 percent of them are in Tamil Nadu. But there are 1,000 million Muslims throughout the world. Fundamentalists are presently bombing many countries in the world. Fundamentalists of all religions in Sri Lanka are at present active.
The Government needs to control them. The Sri Lankan people showed what they needed on May 1st this year. Since then, the Government is trying its best to postpone elections. Earlier the people had no liking to this Government, but now they really hate it, he added.

Hyundai Kona crossover to arrive next year
Hyundai has just announced its new B-segment Kona crossover, with plans for an all-electric model to be introduced in 2018.
The Kona EV, which will share a platform with sister company Kia's Stonic crossover, is part of the brand's focus on alternatively fuelled vehicles. Hyundai recently launched the Ioniq hatchback, which is available as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid (PHEV) or full electric model - the first car from any manufacturer to be offered with three different electric drive options.
Hyundai plans to introduced 30 new models in the next three years, including more fuel cell vehicles like its ix35, as part of a clean mobility strategy.
The specifics of the Kona's power systems are yet to be revealed. It's likely to use a system similar to that found in the Ioniq Electric, which uses a 28kWh lithium-ion polymer to power an 88kW motor. This generates 118bhp and 295Nm of torque, giving the Ioniq a range of 174 miles - a little shy of the Kona's 242-mile target.
Hyundai Motor Company vice chairman Euisun Chung said: We are targeting a mass production of EV from next year. The Kona EV may be able to go over 390km (242 miles) using all electric power.

IMF raises Chinas GDP growth  outlook to 6.7%
The International Monetary Fund yesterday raised its forecast for Chinas 2017 economic growth to 6.7 percent, its third increase this year, citing policy support, especially expansionary credit and public investment.
In April, the IMF hiked its forecast for this year to 6.6 percent from Januarys 6.5 percent, which was 0.3 percentage points above the previous projection.
Chinas economy grew a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first quarter of this year, well above the governments target of around 6.5 percent for the full year.
The IMF said it now expects Chinas growth to average 6.4 percent annually during 2018-2020. In April, the IMF said it expected 2018 growth to be 6.2 percent.
Along with a higher growth forecast, the IMF yesterday recommended China speed up reforms to transition its economy to more sustainable growth and adopt less accommodative monetary policy.
The critically important recent focus on tackling financial sector risks should continue, even if it entails some financial tensions and slower growth, IMF deputy managing director David Lipton said in Beijing.
China needs to ensure that where credit is granted, it is backing economic activity that will be useful, that will be supportive of growth and will permit debts to be serviced without difficultly, he said.
China should also resume progress toward a flexible exchange rate, Lipton said, while adding that the IMF assesses the yuan to be broadly in line with fundamentals.
The strengthening US economy, albeit with normalizing interest rates, is likely to be useful for the rest of the world, Lipton said.
The IMF official said President Xi Jinpings speech at Davos in January was the start of China playing a kind of leadership role at a time when there is a dialog going on around the world about the path of globalization.

A record increase in the human - elephant conflict is reported from Anuradhapura district with the prevailing drought.
According to information from wildlife conservation and district management sources, during the last six months, nine deaths had occurred as a result of wild elephant attacks in the district.
A majority of jumbos are killed due to swallowing Hakka Patas - an explosive device hidden sophisticatedly inside a pumpkin.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that wild elephants are playing havoc invading remote villages such as Horowpothana, Kahatagasdigiliya, Kebithigollewa, Palagala, Palugaswewa and Thirappane DS divisions due to a lack of food and water in the jungle.
We are receiving a large number of applications seeking compensation for damages caused to property including cultivations due to elephant attacks. During the last few months, we paid Rs. 1.5 million as compensation. The payment of compensation and gratuities on behalf of those killed by jumbos is being accelerated, Wannianayake said. Meanwhile, it is learnt that the construction of electrified fences to an extent of around 800 km in the Anuradhapura district as proposed by the divisional secretaries has been dragging mainly due to the lack of funds and wrong information.

The two youngsters replace opening batsman Rohit Sharma and allrounder Hardik Pandya from the 15-man Champions Trophy squad, which is defending its title in England and Wales.
Pant, who has played just one T20 international for India, and Yadav were already on the radar after being named among five players kept on standby for the 50-over tournament.
The duo have been rewarded for their excellent showing on the domestic circuit, including impressive displays in the Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament. Pant, 19, hit two fifties for Delhi Daredevils in the recent IPL edition, following on from a 326-ball 308 in the domestic Ranji Trophy last season.
His aggressive left-handed batting and ability to handle the pressure of a high-stakes match impressed chief selector MSK Prasad, who described him as a player for the future.
Yadav piqued interest in his Test debut, clinching four wickets in Indias series victory over Australia in March.
The 22-year-old from Kanpur in northern India also put in a strong showing for his IPL side Kolkata Knight Riders. AFP

Island paradox
After dealing with a flight from hell with a Russian techno-tippler that drank more than all of the rest of the people on the plane put together, I was very relieved, on arrival at Colombo airport, to be taken on a religious tour with my wonderful Jetwing Travels driver Ranjan. On meeting me at the airport handed me a cool towel and water, and as I gathered my thoughts as he was mildly amused by my stories of mile-high physical and mental torture by my travelling companion, a dementor who craved attention, any attention, even bad attention, the latter of which he found the most amusing. However, I unwittingly, moved on to another completely different kind of madness and demonic possession to be found hidden in the catholic enclave of Negombo.
3D sculptures
Being fascinated by different religions I booked on a religious tour of Negombo, and was amazed by how much Buddhism is buried in amongst this Catholic town known to many as Little Italy. I learn from Reverend Aluvihara Thusithagnana Thero that it is very important to have a Buddhist temple in a place where the majority are Christians and says the importance of Buddhism in Negombo is shown on Poya Days, when the temple gets around 10,000 people coming to Angurukaramulla to make special ritual food donations.
Barefoot, I entered the over 200 year old temple through a giant lions mouth, and was amazed by the elaborate and colourful 3D sculptures showing various stages of life with the second, after infancy, being a little guy with a cricket bat, which seemed to come even before learning to walk showing the importance of cricket in Sri Lanka. I placed some large pink flowers I bought at the entrance amongst others on the altar before the Buddha, paying tribute to a philosopher and his great philosophy.
The scale and multitude of sculptures in this temple are breath-taking but nothing prepares you for the madness hitherto hinted at. Next door to the temple, we were treated, along with plenty of families going about their religious business, to a range of sculptures depicting grotesque human mutilations of naked men and women at the hands of their darker skinned, red-bulging-eyed demonic tormentors, who were doing the bidding of their big kahuna at the beginning of the exhibits, sitting in state and twice the size of his subordinates. We were treated to an array of hacked off limbs, gouged out eyes on sticks, a woman tied upside down legs wide apart being hand sawn in half, a child being rolled in a barrel filled with bloodied spikes, further amputations, beheadings and goodness knows what else reminding us what happens to you if you do not follow the right path in life  I was beginning to wish I was back on the plane in scintillating conversation with the wannabe Cossack.
Spiritual traditions
What were the parents doing, showing their kids this or did they, too, stumble into this dungeon unsuspectingly like we did And then, to cap it all, there was a collection box at the end of it, as if we would want to help pay for the upkeep of hell. That said, if you are the sort of person that would like the London Dungeons or New York underworld youll love this but what a contrast to the temple are the wonderful people you meet as you travel through this magical island.
Negombo is a great place to start exploring the religions of Sri Lanka and to see the dark demons that threaten her peace, side by side with three of the great religions and philosophies of the world. Our tour ended in old Negombo Fort at Sri Sithy Vinayagar Hindu temple on135 Sea Street, Negombo Fort. Just over the fishing bridge lies this spectacular 300-year-old kovil, renovated less than five years ago with vibrantly coloured spiritual figures, the gods framing the door, each one with a story to tell. I learn that Hinduism, with all its spiritual traditions, came to Sri Lanka through Indias tea estate workers that were brought over by the British. During the day you will see an old man taking coconuts, cracked on the front entrance stone, and turning them into coconut oil, which is added to wicks for lighting the pottery lamps inside.
Across the road garlands of fresh flowers are being strung together for the 6.45am pooja, when a daily ritual of mango or banana, rice with incense sticks, and flowers are stuffed inside a coconut bowl and made as offerings to the gods. Circumnavigate the temple clockwise and you will discover the painted carts representing different animals that belong to the gods and are seen as their vehicles to take them around. Every year in August there are ten days of processions known as the Awani Saduthi festival. These include taking statues, honouring the rat, elephant, tiger and lion, around the Negombo Fort backstreets in the early evening, with coconuts for good luck crushed under the wheels of the sacred carts. After lighting a candle we did a tour around the temple with a pilgrim and then headed on home spiritually richer from this very special tour.

Lanka Sathosa Chairman nails plastic rice canard
Lanka Sathosa Chairman T M K B Tennakoon said he would make a complaint in the CID on Monday asking to investigate on the individuals who spread the canard on plastic rice in social media.
The Chairman addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday said he believed that the false campaign was a deliberate attempt to disrepute Lanka Sathosa and create a public opinion that sub-standard goods are sold in its outlets.
We want the individuals behind this campaign be exposed he said. When asked whether Lanka Sathosa experienced a decline in trade over the past few day, the Chairman said, We did not assess yet, but this incident obviously made an impact on the sales.
He pointed out the RRDI in its report released on Wednesday said a rice ball made out of any rice variety could bounce back to a height of about 20 cm. He said Lanka Sathosa had a consignment of 20 metric tons of Basmati rice imported from Pakistan, adding that 16 metric tons of it has already been sold and the rest would also be sold in the coming days. He said the import of rice from Pakistan would continue.
He also said it is difficult to sell rice at the maximum retail price set by the Government, adding that measures have been taken to import rice from countries such as India to control the prices.
He said the matter of rice prices will be discussed at the Cost of Living Cabinet Sub-Committee.

Nagananda Kodithuwakkus petition dismissed
A writ petition filed by a public interests litigation activist seeking a Mandamus Order directing the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation into the abuse of the Tax-free permit scheme by 85 Government and Opposition Parliamentarians was yesterday dismissed by Supreme Court on the ground that there is no basis to proceed with the petition.
The petition had been filed by Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku naming the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption Commission which has failed to perform their statutory duty on the plausible complaint made on corruption against members of parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers who have patently abused the public office to defraud the governments tax-revenue for unjust enrichment.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne with State Counsel Suren Gnanaraj appearing for the Bribery Commission informed court that the Bribery Commission has initiated an investigation into the incident. He said there is no necessity to proceed with the petition since the Bribery Commission has already indicated an investigation into the complaint.
The Supreme Court bench comprised Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justices Upali Abeyratne and Anil Goonaratne. The Finance Ministers deliberate action has paved the way for the loss of government revenue of over 7 billion rupees and as at December 9, 2016, 85 expensive vehicles have been imported evading the tax component of over 33 million rupees for eachvehicle.
Most of the vehicles imported by those who have purchased the permits have been registered with the Department of Motor Traffic first in the name of the permit holder MP and then immediately afterwards transferred in the name of the buyers of the permits.

If we are to learn a lesson from previous events, right action seems to come too late. A case in point is the language issue; the LSSP and the CP who championed the cause for one united country by granting parity of status for both Sinhala and Tamil languages were treated derogatorily and the lives of the leaders were threatened. Ironically, half a century later, both languages have now become official languages, and it is not difficult to surmise that had the right step been taken at that time, the 30 year war, with its heavy toll, may have been averted!
Rev. Fr. AF humbly states, I must also be willing to let my narrow understanding of truth be broken open to learn my own beliefs better by understanding the other, and in this way to let myself be furthered on the path to God A similar view was expressed by Rev. Dulip de Chickera, when we met at the cremation of Rev. Prof. Dhammavihari (former Professor of Buddhist Philosophy at Peradeniya); he went on to say my association with the monk enabled me to understand Christianity better.
My English Language teacher at Royal College explained to the class the word Catholic- as being derived from the Greek word katholikos meaning universal. In the Buddhas teachings we come across sabbe sattha bhavanthu sukhitattha meaning may all beings be well and happy. When these were mentioned during a commemoration of a religious event, a Muslim gentleman came up to me and asked me if I knew the meaning of the word Islam- he said Islam meant peace. According to the Bhagavadgitha dvau bhutasargau loke smindaiva . there are only two types of men in this world, the one possessing a divine nature and the other possessing a demoniac disposition. Thus the universal nature and peace promoting ideal of all major religions, for all people, is unequivocal.
Inter-religious dialogue
Rev. Fr. AF emphatically states, preventing a catastrophe is by way of an inter-religious dialogue. Such activity will expose one to others of different faiths, learn to respect each other, see the others point of view and stop being narrow-minded. The ultimate reality is in progress, not in dogma and bigotry. When one thinks he knows, he stops seeing, as knowledge tends to stand in the way of truth.
At present, there is some amount of dialogue at the top, amongst leaders of the different religions. Such once in a while dialogue involving only a few individuals will not produce the desired result, as it does not trickle down to the masses  the followers of the different religions. To have any significant effect, the people should start talking to each other, opening themselves to the followers of other world religions, understanding their faith and beginning to respect them. The dialogue should be open and honest, helping others to see the world the way it is. Lies should not be uttered for the sake of ones own mental health; honesty with nothing to hide will make life easy.
The stage is well set for such dialogue, if only the opportunity is grabbed. In our country, we have 25 public holidays; barring only two  the independence commemoration and the May Day, they are all linked to the various nationalities and religions. Declaration of a public holiday is for the purpose of commemorating an event, but how many of us can honestly say we engage in some activity connected with such event
A practical approach would be to restructure our public holidays. In addition to the Independence commemoration and May Day, Thai-Pongal, National New Year (two days), Vesak (two days), Poson, Ramazan and Christmas  this group of ten days only, could constitute our national holidays.
The remaining ten Poya days, Hadji, Prophet Mohammeds Birthday, Mahasivarathri, Deepawali and Good Friday may be made full working days, with the exception that the first two hours i.e. 8 am to 10 am, be spent in an activity devoted to the significance of that particular days event.
On a Poya day, a bana preaching/meditation for one hour, followed by an hours dialogue. Similarly, on Hadji and Prophet Mohammeds Birthday, an hours programme on some aspect of Islam, on Deepavali and Mahasivarathri day a Hindu Religious/Cultural programme of one hour, and on Good Friday, a prayer service and talk on aspects of Christianity, of one hours duration, and each of the sessions followed by an hours dialogue.
This will ensure that everyone will at least spend some time meaningfully, in observance of the particular event commemorated on that day.
Different religious and ethnic groups
It will also promote understanding of the different religions and cultures, and integration and harmony amongst the different religious and ethnic groups, as all separate groups will jointly be involved in arranging and participating in each others function, and after a good healthy dialogue, getting back to work after partaking in fellowship and refreshments.
Such activity well planned and executed in work places and schools will ensure that the inter-religious dialogue will trickle down to every strata of society; it will promote better understanding and respect for each others cultures, build bridges, facilitate cross faith interactions, build new friendships and regain inter community trust essential for ensuring harmony and oneness. As Rev. Fr. AF says, In sincere dialogue, we discover that which is good, true, beautiful and holy in other religions and begin to appreciate it.
As an added benefit, we will be curtailing the number of special holidays, increasing the number of working days, thereby helping the countrys smooth administration and economy.
It is imperative that preventive action is instituted swiftly, people made knowledgeable and prepared ethically and morally, as the rabble rousers come disguised and have to be beaten at any cost before they can strike the death blow on our beloved Nation. It is the peoples power only that can defeat such destructive activity; lets empower them and save our Nation.

He wants special food, said the jailor, He says he wants to enjoy the Constitution, feed on his Rights and taste Free Speech once again! He says that his food!
It is, said Liberty, and its mine too!
You mean you going to starve too in jail asked the jailor cruelly.
Without our special food which we as Democracy and Liberty feed on, we will surely die! said both Liberty and Democracy together.
This is the only food we can give you! said the jailor.

Its Presidential Ordinances, mixed with Vetoes, garnished with a sprinkling of Hiring and Firing directors and officials. Tomorrows food is Police Rule and Citizen Surveillance!
Oh my God! whispered Liberty, Is this what they have been trying to feed you with
Democracy nodded.
I need to speak with the President! shouted Liberty.
Well ole gal youll have to wait, said the jailor taking back the food, Hes with the Russian President, learning PutinRecipes to feed our people with!
Liberty and Democracy are still waiting to be released as Americas President learns new recipes to feed his people.

PMI for Manufacturing, Services up
The Manufacturing Sector PMI recorded 57.9 in May which is an increase of 16.1 index points compared to April 2017.
This indicates that the manufacturing activities recovered in May 2017, largely attributable to the expansion in Production and New Orders sub-indices, following the seasonal contraction observed for April 2017. Further, all the sub-indices of PMI apart from the Employment sub-index recorded values above the neutral 50.0 threshold.
However, adverse weather conditions experienced from the 25th day of the month slowed down the expected recovery of the operations due to employee absenteeism and lengthening of the suppliers delivery time.
Nevertheless, the expectation for activities indicates an improvement for the next three months. The Services Sector PMI recorded 55.3 index points in May from 54.2 index points in April 2017. The moderate acceleration in the Services sector was supported by New Businesses, Business Activity and Employment.
A recovery of Employment was observed in May following the contraction observed in April 2017. Expectations for Activity decelerated in May due to reasons such as adverse weather conditions and pacing out of peak and festive seasons in certain sub-sectors.
Backlogs of Work declined, continuing the trend observed since the survey began.

## Title: A PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR URBAN AREAS
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, June 16, 2017 - 01:00
A PROPER WASTE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR URBAN AREAS
Solid waste is the term generally used to describe non-liquid waste materials from domestic, trade, commercial, agricultural and industrial activities. Growth in population and industrial activities in most developing countries has led to over exploitation of natural resources which are highly related with waste generation. Two types of solid waste are composed of Biodegradable solid waste and Non- Biodegradable solid waste.
In urban areas in Sri Lanka, solid waste is generated through a wide variety of sources including commercial enterprises, industries and households. These problems are now most severe in urban areas in Sri Lanka. Hence, the availability of proper waste management methods is crucial to minimize the waste problem. Concerning incorporate management activities associated with generation, storage and transport processing of solid waste in an environmentally sound manner.
At present, although there are solid waste management systems in the cities in urban areas, 90 percent of the waste generated is disposed into the dumping areas illegally. Due to the lack of collecting vehicles and political interference, the authorities concerned do not properly pick up waste throughout the country. In addition, the people follow the easiest way of throwing garbage on the streets without using the garbage bins. The tourist hotels, guest houses and cottages discharge remnant food wrapped in polythene sheets and some enterprises also discharge packing materials such as plastic, regiform in the same manner. The discharge of solid waste destroys the natural beauty of the environment. The informal disposal of solid waste has become an acute social problem spreading diseases throughout the country. The foregoing problems highlight the comparative need for a regular proper waste management method in combating pollution in Sri Lanka.
At present there is no proper solid waste management plan and Local Government agencies grapple with the waste problem with a poor budget, thereby leading to incomplete cleaning, collection, disposal and burning of waste materials. This shows the incapability and irresponsibility of solid waste management. An awareness campaign aiming at the general public has to be launched in resolving the ever-increasing solid waste problem.
Educating the public on waste management
Major specific objectives must include proper methods and peoples attitudes towards a solid waste management plan to minimize waste problems for the urban areas. Proper methods include identifying major impacts of improper disposal of solid waste, identifying private sector involvement in solid waste management and identifying the following wastes, solid waste comprising non-liquid waste materials from domestic, institutional, market, medical and commercial source and streets and garden wastes (food, paper, cardboard, vegetation, rubber, leather, discarded clothing). Also include packing materials (plastic and glass) and cut pieces from garment factories.
Urban solid waste includes all waste collected and controlled by the Local Authorities or Municipal Councils other than sewage that is residential waste, commercial and market refuse, institutional refuse, street, sweepings, construction and demolition debris and any other municipal waste.
The household garbage and rubbish category comprises waste as a result of household activities including food preparation, sweepings, cleaning etc. In developing countries like Sri Lanka, this category largely consists of kitchen waste, paper, glass metal and plastics.
Commercial and market refuse consists of waste from stores, offices, hotel and markets. This waste typically consists of packaging, container materials, used office supplies and food waste.
Municipal solid wastes are non-hazardous waste disposed by local communities. They have to deal with collection, disposing of what most of us offhandedly call trash, collection of cans, bottles, food scraps, newspapers, lawn clippings and old furniture that characterizes everyday living. Institutional refuse category involves a large portion of paper rather than food generated from schools, government offices, hospitals, police barracks and religious buildings.
Street sweepings category of waste includes dirt and litter containing an appreciable amount of household refuse, drain cleaning and animal manure. Most of the street sweepings include kitchen waste and paper because the primary method of refuse waste is the placement of waste on the roadsides.The composition of solid waste is similar to that of rural towns in Sri Lanka. More than 80 percent of waste materials is bio-degradable, tree cutting and other garden waste constituting the major share.
Solid waste management means the handing process of solid waste materials from generation to its disposal. From generation to disposal a clear material flow can be identified. They are generation, storage, discharges, transportation and processing and final disposal.
Proper National Waste Management Strategy
Then a successful management should include management activities associated with the above mentioned process and the final disposal of treated waste in an environmentally friendly manner. In Sri Lanka, local authorities have the responsibility of managing waste and organizing the collection of waste for its areas and delivering them to the point of disposal.
The National Waste Management Strategy (NWMS) should involvewaste avoidance, reduction, refuse and recycling and final disposal in an environmentally sound manner. (Ministry of Environmental & National Resources, 2002). The National policies should be aimed at reducing waste by consumers through education and awareness creation. The present rate of waste generation can be reduced to a considerable extent by sound housekeeping practices. Reducing the demand for packaging systems adopted by the consumers by means of deciding their own disposal problem at source and the problems associated with the final disposal, can bring about a reduction in generation of such waste to a considerable extent. A consumer should be encouraged to use biodegradable packaging materials as much as possible and manufacturers encouraged to reduce unnecessary packaging to facilitate environmentally friendly disposal systems. This in turn will reduce their production costs.
As set out earlier, the solid waste generation in urban and rural areas presently remains at a very high level caused by unsuitable transportation processes and poor storage facilities for vegetables, fruits and other perishables. These perishable products become waste products in the market places owing to inefficient handling and current packaging systems. A proper post harvesting marketing chain system should be developed with appropriate technology to avoid or minimize the generation of waste. A new strategy should also be developed in reducing the plastic and non-biodegradable waste in the packaging sector. Otherwise, this remains an environmental and health problem in the country. In the absence of well established plastic waste recycling facilities, these problems will be accentuated in the future. Hence, the use of plastic should be controlled as much as possible in preference to paper, glass, cloth and other biodegradable materials.
The consumers should be encouraged to reuse the products in question for some other use in an environmentally sound manner without disposing it at once. (Ministry of Environmental & Natural Resources, 2002)
Recycling of waste
Recycling of waste enables to reuse the waste to a considerable extent, thereby making final disposal manageable. Sustainable waste collection systems should be established in order to make recycling economically viable.Most of the solid waste in the form of biodegradable waste, makes it suitable for composting. It has been found that incineration is not economically viable.
Hence, composting of organic waste should be given serious attention by the local authorities concerned, owing to the high prices of the chemical fertilizers and the associated health problems with the overuse of chemical fertilizers. The farmers should be encouraged to use compost produced by organic waste as a soil conditioner. However, it should be noted that the quality of the compost would depend mostly on the degree of contamination and the type of the organic waste. Plants and animals have a tendency to use heavy metals in this respective systems, which is a significant risk to food chain crops. So, Sri Lanka should have heavy metal standards for compost. Segregation of waste by source plays an important role in producing compost of a better quality. With a view to augmenting market for compositing, arrangements should be made through the authorities concerned in stimulating the agricultural sector to use compost as a soil conditioner.
Ceylon glass company uses 42 percent of waste glass in the process of production, the company has facilities, up to 60 percent if waste glass is available. Use of broken glass enables Ceylon Glass company to reduce the production process when waste glass is used. The amounts of raw materials required for glass production can enable saving of material resources.
The existing technology in Sri Lanka in the process of paper production equipment should be improved upon to use various types of paper waste. There is a paramount imperative to formulate policies to make optimum use of the available waste.

When he later tells her that he is a prince and not only just any Prince, but the Prince of Orange and heir apparent to the Dutch throne, she laughs. She thinks he is joking.
He is not, of course. The Prince makes sure their paths cross again, a few weeks later in New York. Within two years their love blossoms until one day, he decides to propose to the girl of his dreams at the Huis ten Bosch Palace in The Hague. They had been roller-blading when Alexander suggests they have a break and lures Mxima to a pond where he has hidden roses and champagne. By the side of the pond, he proposes in English so he could be sure Mxima would understand him, and she immediately says yes. He then presents his bride-to-be with a platinum-set engagement ring.
But as most things in life their journey of love too had its setbacks. The romance caused an uproar when the political past of Maximas father was revealed. Things were finally sorted out when the Dutch Government asked her father to agree not to attend the wedding. Her mother too decided to stay back in Argentina.
Two days before the fairy tale event took place, a dinner and a ball were held for 500 guests at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam to celebrate not only the upcoming wedding, but also the 64th birthday of Queen Beatrix. The next day, February 1, 2002, 1600 guests attended a concert and a luncheon at the Concertgebouw, a concert hall in Amsterdam. The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra played Sergei Prokofievs orchestral suite, Romeo and Juliet. As a surprise for the Argentinean bride, a tango was also played.
On her wedding day, Mxima wore a dress designed and manufactured by the Valentino fashion house in Rome. The dress was made of ivory mikado silk, a blend of silks that results in a heavier fabric frequently used for cool weather weddings, and had long sleeves and a cowl-like neck. It was close fitting to the waist with a slightly flared skirt with embroidered lace panels and a five meter long train. The long veil of silk tulle was dotted with hand-decorated motifs of flowers and tendrils of lace. Her tiara was composed of pieces from the jewel collection of the Royal House of the Netherlands. In her hands were an elongated bouquet of white roses, gardenia, lily of the valley, and two kinds of greens.
The bridesmaids wore a skirt of red satin and a blouse of red velvet with matching red satin shoes. They had burgundy-colored floral wreaths in their hair.
On his wedding day, the Prince wore the full uniform of the Captain in the Royal Netherlands Navy.
Among the guests present were the UKs Prince of Wales, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan and former South African President Nelson Mandela. Also, there were the kings of Sweden, Norway and Belgium and the queen of Denmark, along with Japans Crown Prince Naruhito and Jordans Queen Noor, the widow of King Hussein.
As the wedding ceremony took place in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam church in Holland, the streets outside turned into a mass of orange as about 80,000 spectators waited in the winter sunshine for a glimpse of the couple.
After the formal ceremonies, Prince Alexander and Princes Maxima rode through Amsterdam in a gilded carriage, escorted by more than 200 police and royal grenadiers on foot and on horseback.
As the couple stepped on to a balcony of the Royal Palace, many in the crowd waved small plastic flags saying kiss.
They did, and the crowd cheered.
Many years later Prince Alexander confessed, Im glad I found a normal woman to marry. But a skeptical look from his wife caused him to correct himself. He laughed and said, I mean, an extraordinary woman that can keep me down to earth.
Here then is the story of Romeo and Juliet, retold, with a happy ending.

Russia says it may have killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi


Russia's Defense Ministry says it is investigating reports that ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killedin one of its airstrikes in Syrialast month.
The airstrike on May 28 was carried out on the outskirts of the militant group's de facto capital Raqqa, on a command post where ISIS leaders were meeting, according to Russian state media reports.
"According to information, which is being verified via different channels, the meeting was also attended by the (ISIS) leader Ibrahim Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was eliminated in the strike," the ministry said, according to the TASS report in English. Other state media reported that more than 300 "terrorists" were killed in the strike.
An image grab taken from a propaganda video released on July 5, 2014 of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Mosul.
The leaders were discussing their exit from the city through the so-called southern corridor, the ministry said.
The airstrike was carried out following drone footage confirmation of the council's meeting location, state-run Sputnik reports.
US defense officials said they were unable to confirm the reports. Col. Ryan Dillon, a spokesman for the US-led coalition's operation against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, said the coalition "cannot confirm these reports at this time."
There have been multiple reports of Baghdadi's death in the past that have turned out to be false.
Officials had long described the ISIS leader asenemy No. 1 in the fight against ISIS, and speculation had swirled over his whereabouts.
Baghdadi has kept a low profile, speaking out in occasional videos andaudio messages.
He gave a sermon at a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul in 2014, in which he declared himself the leader of his envisaged Islamic caliphate. The sermon was filmed and widely watched around the world.
US forces captured him in Falluja, Iraq, in 2004. At the time, he was considered a low-level al Qaeda member.
He was freed in 2009, and within a year was the leader of Iraq's al Qaeda affiliate, heading up a renewed campaign of bombings and assassinations. Al Qaeda leaders later severed relations with him, saying he was insubordinate, killing too many civilians.
As the leader of ISIS, which has seized and lost swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, he earned a reputation for brutality.
The extremist group brought a reign of terror and intimidation into areas where they gained control. And the brutality has continued, despite military setbacks. In one reported case, ISIS slaughtered 163 civilians and left their bodies in the street for days, the United Nations said.
US authorities offereda $25 million reward for information leading to his capture.
Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, which is a nom de guerre, was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al Samarrai.

Over 1,800 students and 1,600 parents took part in workshops of the Sampath Bank Pahe Shishyathwa seminar series held recently at Kirindiwela Central College, Kirindiwela and Malwattawala Central College, Wellawaya.
The Bank has been conducting these workshops for nine consecutive years to support underprivileged students around the country. It seeks to provide them with the requisite knowledge and skills to help them better prepare for the most challenging exams during their primary school years.
Sampath Bank will be conducting similar workshops in Polghawela, Galle,Homagama, Batticaloa and Ratnapuraduring the coming months.
Every year, about 350,000 students sit for the grade five scholarship exams across Sri Lanka with the hope of getting the opportunity to pursue their further studies at some of the countrys premier educational institutions. It is viewed as a ticket to a brighter future, especially for students from underprivileged, rural communities.
However, it is these students who often do not have the necessary support infrastructure to help them in preparing for this exam. Having realized the challenges they face, Sampath Bank embarked on this noble initiative in 2009 to take the best of training and resources closer to their hometowns.
The free workshops are open to all students sitting for the exam this year irrespective of whether they hold an account with Sampath Bank or not.
Participants can directly walk in on the day of the event without any prior registrations. At Sampath Bank, we actively strive to add value to the communities that we are present in, with education being one of the key focus areas of these engagement initiatives. Given the importance of education in shaping a childs future, we are delighted to conduct the Sampath Bank Pahe Shishyathwa seminar series for 9 consecutive years with the aim of supporting underprivileged students,. said Lalith Weragoda, Head of Human Resources, Sampath Bank.
While touching on the core subject areas, the Sampath Bank Pahe Shishyathwa seminar series primarily focuses on grooming their minds to not give into examination and face such challenging situations with greater confidence.

Shabaab restaurant assault leaves 18 dead in Mogadishu
SOMALIA: A suicide car bombing and armed assault by six Shabaab militants on two neighbouring restaurants in Somalias capital Mogadishu ended Thursday morning with at least 18 dead, the government said.
The operation is over now and the gunmen were killed by the security forces, said Mohamed Ahmed Arab, spokesman for Somalias security ministry.
He said the six attackers -- one suicide bomber and five gunmen -- attacked business places and killed innocent civilians: 18 civilians were killed, including a Syrian national, and more than 10 others were wounded.
The attack began at around 8pm (1700GMT) on Wednesday evening with a suicide car bombing at the Posh Treats restaurant and club, after which gunmen stormed inside the nearby Pizza House restaurant. The Syrian national is believed to have been a chef at Pizza House.
Both venues are popular with affluent, young and diaspora Somalis and were busy as customers broke the Ramadan fast.
Islamist attacks often increase in tempo during the holy month but Wednesdays was the first major assault by the Shabaab this Ramadan.
The gunmen spent the night roaming the restaurant killing those they found trapped before they were eventually killed by security forces whose operation had been slowed by the darkness.
Survivors and witnesses described chaos after the bomb went off.
I was about to have dinner when the blast threw me to the ground, said Abdikarim Ahmed, a customer at Posh Treats. I rushed to the nearby exit and went out. I could see the chaos caused by the blast and shrapnel everywhere.
Abdukadir Mohamed, who was close by, said it was the loudest blast he had ever heard in years living in Mogadishu. It was very close. I could see the huge fire it caused, the dust, destruction, everything. Both Pizza House and Posh Treats were on fire. The whole area looked like a different place, he said.
Others spoke of finding dead relatives and friends. One of my neighbours was among the dead, a young innocent girl. When I saw her body this morning I could not stop my tears, said Abdiwahid Ali.
Worshippers in a neighbouring mosque were thrown to the ground and felt the walls shake and windows shatter.
You cannot recognise this area, said Hawa Ahmed, a local resident and a regular at Pizza House, who had opted not to visit last night.
Where there were two beautiful restaurants, this morning there is complete devastation and death, blood and body parts everywhere.
The Shabaab, an al-Qaeda aligned militant group that carries out regular suicide bombings and raids in the capital against civilian, government and military targets, claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had targeted a nightclub frequented by foreigners, government and intelligence officials.
Pizza House, where most of the civilian victims were killed, is a popular outdoor spot for iftar, the breaking of the Ramadan fast.
Posh Treats in a converted villa across the road is a liberal hangout with shisha pipes and a disco, a rarity in Mogadishu.
The austere Shabaab group, which wants to impose a Taliban-style rule on Somalia, has been fighting for the last decade to overthrow successive internationally-backed governments in Mogadishu and has also launched attacks in Kenya and Uganda, both contributors to a 22,000-strong African Union force in the country.
Although pushed out of the capital in 2011 the group still controls parts of the countryside, where a drought threatens to tip into famine this year. - AFP

Sharapova receives invite to WTA Stanford event
Los Angeles: Five-time grand slam champion Maria Sharapova has received an invitation to play at the WTA Stanford tournament at the end of next month as the Russian star continues her return from a doping suspension.
Sharapovas comeback from a 15-month doping ban will include a stop at Stanford University for the July 31-August 6 event, organizers announced on Wednesday.
Officials gave the 30-year-old Sharapova a wildcard entry as she gets set to compete in the tournament for the first time six years.
I am excited to return to the Bank of the West Classic and would like to thank the tournament for giving me the opportunity to play, Sharapova said.
Former world number one Victoria Azarenka is also in the 28-player singles draw.
Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, a heart and blood boosting drug, at the 2016 Australian Open. She said that she had taken it for several years and did not know it had been placed on the banned list at the beginning of 2016. Sharapova was issued a two-year suspension, but the Court of Arbitration for Sport reduced the ban on appeal.
Sharapova, ranked 173rd in the world, made her tour return in April at Stuttgart, reaching the semi-finals.
She had been due to try to qualify for Wimbledon but she pulled out earlier this week, citing a muscle injury. She was denied a invite to the French Open, which wrapped up Sunday. AFP

Sharma ton sees India into Champions Trophy final with Pakistan
Birmingham: Rohit Sharmas unbeaten century sealed Indias place in a Champions Trophy final against arch-rivals Pakistan after the title-holders thrashed Bangladesh by nine wickets at Edgbaston on Thursday.
Bangladeshs total of 264 for seven never looked like being enough and was duly made to look inadequate by Indias powerful top-order.
Sharma and fellow opener Shikhar Dhawan (46) put on 87 before Sharma (123 not out) and India captain Virat Kohli (96 not out) completed the job with nearly 10 overs to spare.
Their unbroken partnership of 178 delighted the huge India contingent in a crowd of 24,340 -- a record for a one-day international at Edgbaston.
Yet the real India hero of this match was part-time spinner Kedar Jadhav, who dismissed both of Bangladeshs top-scorers in Tamim Iqbal (70) and Mushfiqur Rahim (61) in a spell of two for 22 in six overs.
The third-wicket duo shared a stand of 123, but Bangladeshs innings faltered after their exits.
India hammered Pakistan by 124 runs in the teams Champions Trophy opener at Edgbaston 11 days ago.
But Pakistan themselves trounced much-fancied tournament hosts England by eight wickets in another lopsided semi-final in Cardiff on Wednesday.
Sundays match at the Oval in London will be just the second time the Asian giants have met in the final of a major International Cricket Council tournament.
India beat Pakistan by a mere five runs in the 2007 World Twenty20 final in Johannesburg, a victory that led to the creation of the lucrative Indian Premier League.
India had a wicket as early as the first over Thursday after Kohli won the toss and fielded under grey skies.
Soumya Sarkar fall for a second-ball duck when he played on attempting a booming drive off Bhuvneshwar Kumar.
At one for one, there were fears that Bangladesh, who collapsed to 84 all out in a 240-run warm-up thrashing by India last month, were poised for another top-order slump.
But new batsman Sabbir Rahman cover-drove his first ball, from Jasprit Bumrah, for four.
Sabbir hit four boundaries in his 19 but just as he was getting into top gear he cut Kumar straight to Ravindra Jadeja at point.
But from 46 for two, the experienced pair of Tamim and Mushfiqur rebuilt the innings.
Tamim, bowled off a Hardik Pandya no-ball on 17, was in fine touch.
The left-handed opener whipped Pandya over mid-wicket for six and his reverse-sweep four off left-arm spinner Jadeja saw him to a 62-ball fifty.
It appeared a minor success for Bangladesh when Jadhav came on in a match where frontline off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwins first seven overs cost 42 runs.
Tamim struck three fours in as many balls off Ashwin -- a cut, a sweep and a nudge past fine leg.
This was Tamims fourth fifty in his last five innings, but he gave his wicket away when bowled trying to sweep Jadhav.
Mushfiqur made a stylish 61-ball fifty but when, to his evident dismay, he hit a Jadhav full toss to Kohli at mid-wicket, Bangladesh were 179 for five in the 36th over.
By this stage they had also lost Shakib Al Hasan (15), whose 114 and Bangladesh record stand of 224 with Mahmudullah (102 not out) had seen the Tigers recover from a top-order collapse to beat New Zealand last time out.
Indias reply began with a welter of boundaries, Sharma square-driving Mustafizur Rahman for an elegant four.
Left-hander Dhawan was in fine touch too, hoisting Taskin Ahmed over square leg for six.
The only question now was Indias margin of victory, with Bangladesh -- in their first major semi-final -- avoiding a 10-wicket defeat when Dhawan sliced skipper Mashrafe Mortaza to backward point.
Sharma completed his 11th ODI hundred in style when he hooked Mustafizur for his first six in 111 balls also including 12 fours.
Kohli then finished the match in emphatic fashion, cover-driving Sabbir for four. AFP

Sri Lanka-Bangladesh bilateral trade triples to US$ 142 mn in 2016
Sri Lanka-Bangladesh bilateral trade tripled since 2010 including a three-fold rise in exports. However there are several unexplored potentials, said Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishad Bathiudeen.
He was addressing High Commissioner of Bangladesh in Sri Lanka, Riaz Hamidullah at the Ministry. Even our exports to Bangladesh increased in the last five years, said Minister Bathiudeen and added: We are looking for much bigger trade and investments to Sri Lanka from Dhaka as well in the aftermath of proposed high level Business Forum to be held along with this event, which is essential for B2B links.
According to the Department of Commerce, total trade between both countries that was at a mere US $48 million in 2010 has tripled to US$ 142 million in 2016. The balance of trade between two countries has always been in favour of Sri Lanka. Among Sri Lankas top exports to Bangladesh are Cotton, Plastics, fabrics, Soap and washing preparations, and lubricants. Sri Lankas exports to Bangladesh at $ 35 million in 2010 too tripled (to $112 million) in 2016.
Among top imports from Bangladesh to Sri Lanka are medicines, textile fibres and paper yarn, steel, apparel and cotton. The US $13 million imports volume to Sri Lanka from Bangladesh in 2010 also surged to $ 39 by 2016.
Ambassador Hamidullah said that both countries should work close together mutually to increase trade volumes. I am also pleased to say that the cost of doing business in Bangladesh has significantly decreased in recent years. Already many Lankan companies have invested with us.
Over 45 Lankan companies are already operating in Bangladesh at present with US$ 300 million investment. They are active in the sectors of apparel, banking, paper, and consumer goods.

Sri Lanka reaping benefits of advancing digital revolution
Global Startup Ecosystem Report values local startup ecosystem at over US$ 30mn
While the world has embraced Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabler of social and economic development, there is no doubt that ICT has found its niche in every sphere of Sri Lankas polity.
As the Minister of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Harin Fernando recognizes the colossal role ICT plays.
ICT must be a key driving force in leading Sri Lanka towards a knowledge-based society and leading our society towards a sustainable economy, he said.
A significant milestone in the development of the ICT industry in the country was the formulation of the Information and Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) of Sri Lanka as the apex ICT institution of the Government under the Information and Communication Technology Act No.27 of 2003.
As an institution overseen by Ministry of Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure, ICTA has followed robust programmes, especially in the last two years under the auspices of the Minister.
ICTA facilitates the creation of a dynamic ecosystem with the capacity to respond to technological advances as well as changes in the global technology industry, the Minister said.
With the great potential information and communication technology has to accelerate human and economic progress, the Minister stressed the need to develop new technologies that have lasting social impact and bridge the digital divide.
We need to nurture ideas and innovations especially in ICT entrepreneurship to bring about a significant paradigm shift to achieve sustainable economic and social development, he added.
Taking cues from the burgeoning global entrepreneurial ecosystem the Minister said, Our Government has a forward-looking vision to build a fully integrated entrepreneurial ecosystem so that the country would have the best chances of competing regionally.
Significantly, Sri Lanka for the first time, made an appearance in the Global Startup Ecosystem Report 2017 - a useful benchmark to analyse and compare our countrys standing against how the rest of the world is doing.
Our ICTA has spearheaded initiatives towards this and we have witnessed a spurt of startups and a major growth in entrepreneurship in the last few years, said Minister Fernando.
Minister Harin Fernando
While the recent growth of our startup ecosystem is impressive our continued success to build the capacity of these startups will hinge on our ability to not only put the right policies and strategies in place, but in forming definitive collaborations amongst entrepreneurs, support organizations, and investors, he said.
ICTA acts as a national accelerator to catalyze innovations and through several initiatives provide startups with support.
The Agencys Tech Start-up and IT SMEs Support Programmes have recorded positive results in supporting the industry through its seed funding, market access, mentoring and training initiatives. The Agencys ongoing Spiralation Seed Funding programme which provides seed funding for promising startups has shown impressive outcomes with about 86% of the beneficiary companies being able to continue business without any disruption.
The argument that Lankan startups need funding cannot be overstated. Building the capacity of the majority of local startups is imperative as they often have great ideas but not enough money to implement them, he said.
Offering all players in the startup ecosystem an interactive platform, ICTA annually organizes a startup conference and exhibition. Now in its second consecutive year, Disrupt Asia 2017 features top international speakers, mentors and investors, showcasing innovative startups, propelling Sri Lanka into the entrepreneurial spotlight.

SriLankan Airlines says only 126 recruited from January 2015
SriLankan Airlines yesterday refuted recent media reports that the airline has made 1250 new appointments under the current Director Board.
A company statement said that only 126 have been recruited to the company from January 2015 to May 2017. There are 7029 currently employed in the airline.
The airline in a statement added that the vacancies filled include management trainees, cadet pilots, airport service delivery and additional security personnel recruited due to the increased number of flights and the statutory requirement stipulated by the Civil Aviation Authority to enhance airside security for catering. This accounts for the net inflow of 91 out of the total of 126.
The Airlines fleet has increased from 19 aircraft on January 31, 2015 to 24 aircraft on May 31, 2017 which is a 26 per cent increase,the statement said.

SriLankan claims reduction in losses
The Management of SriLankan Airlines says that since the unity government was formed, the airlines losses have been reduced dramatically contrary to inaccurate reports in the press.
The table below clearly shows that the Rs 91.8 billion in losses between 2011 and 2015 has been reduced to a fraction of this colossal number by 2017.
The fuel price reduction of 2015 saw a drop in ticket prices that did not recover when fuel increased again. The effect of this, coupled with the acceptance of several new and expensive aircraft, a depreciation of the rupee and other currencies against the USD (the majority of airline costs are in USD) saw a weakening of the balance sheet.
The runway re-surfacing project at Bandaranaike International Airport, which was absolutely necessary, also forced the national carrier to cancel over 600 flights, equivalent to two entire weeks of scheduled services, in the first three months of 2017. These factors combined to worsen the performance of what could have been a successful financial year in 2016/17.
The airline continues to pay a heavy price for the extremely high lease rental agreements entered into by the previous government. The cost of terminating the leases on four A350-900 aircraft that were grossly overpriced and completely unsuitable for the national carrier imposed a further burden on the airline. (One-off items in table )
The airline is now undergoing a modest recovery in revenues and is about to launch significant regional expansion. Three new destinations in India, direct flights to Hong Kong & Guangzhou and a long awaited non-stop service to Australia are all planned in the coming months.
Further restructuring is required to reduce the cost base and make the company competitive in this extremely challenging market.
The directors and management team are confident that with the support of the shareholder, the recovery of the national airline will continue and the positive trend will be further improved upon.

Stax gears hosts roadshow for corporates
Stax Inc., a global strategy consulting firm, will host a week-long roadshow for corporates looking to explore emerging markets in areas like East Africa and the Mekong Valley.
During the first week of July, experts will share key learnings and success stories from entering developing markets that hold both tremendous potential as well as great obstacles.
Stax has deep experience in advising companies of varying sizes and stripes on go-to-market strategies. With offices in Boston, Chicago, Colombo, New York, and Singapore, Stax provides global corporate and private equity clients with actionable answers based on deep research and analysis.
The purpose of this roadshow is to highlight a strategic approach to overseas expansion that enables management to make more systematic and data-driven decisions, explained Dr. Kumudu Gunasekera, Director of Stax. With over 20 years of global experience, Stax can guide clients through the challenging process of entering new markets. Our proprietary VIPER approach provides companies with a comprehensive and customized market expansion strategy to help compete in the global market, added Dr. Gunasekera.
VIPERwhich is an acronym standing for Validate, Internalize, Prioritize, Enter, and Refineoutlines the steps that a company can take to make its international expansion more systematic. Stax has conducted over a thousand market studies globally during the last five years, covering multiple industries. Many of these studies place a heavy emphasis on primary research, as close-to-the ground insights and hard-to-access data can be vital when making market entry decisions.
A companys overseas growth prospects often depend on its level of initiative and its appetite for risk-taking. Many corporates hold dominant positions in the local arena, but are wary of taking the plunge into international waters, mainly due to high risks, barriers to entry, and large capital requirements. Of course, there are many cases when the rewards of international expansion will heavily outweigh the risks. Gayan Dias, a Consultant at Stax, points out that, In the past, penetrating the global market merely meant gaining a larger customer base. In the modern context, however, companies that are willing to go global can also access a larger talent pool and innovate faster. This in turn makes it easier for such companies to attract smart capital and fuel further growth.
The upcoming roadshow presents an opportunity for companies interested in expanding overseas to benefit from Staxs global experience, right here in Colombo. For more information on the roadshow, email [emailprotected] or call 076-348-3408.

## Title: Sugar not so sweet
## Supertitle:

Sugar not so sweet
Taxes on imported sugar were increased recently to Rs.25/kg. Consumers will be shocked to learn that the tax is almost 50% of the import price, small wonder that sugar retails for over Rs.100/kg. Strangely, sugar is also subject to price control.
On one hand hefty taxes are imposed to protect the industry which cause prices to rise. On the other hand prices controls are imposed to protect consumers. This does not make sense.
Why is protection necessary
Sri Lanka has a small sugar industry that produces around 50,000 mt of sugar, while consumption is around 550,000 mt.
See Table
In economics, what is called the infant industry argument is often cited as the rationale for protection. Poor nations, the argument goes, benefit from having high-tech, high-value industries that produce positive spillovers -local supply chains, an expert workforce, innovative ideas. But because poor countries have little capital, their high-tech industries cant compete with huge multinationals. So it makes sense to shield these young, promising industries behind protectionist walls for a while, letting them play in the sandbox of the domestic market until they gain the size and know-how to go out and compete in the world.
If the argument was cited in favour of protecting an industry based on advanced technology it may make some sense, but does it apply to basic agriculture
Top sugar producers
Sri Lankas sugar industry has been protected for the better part of forty years, the infant industry is now well into middle-age! If it has not reached the level to compete in the global market after several decades under protection it seems highly unlikely that further gains in productivity will materialise. According to data from the Department of Census and Statistics, sugarcane yield per hectare in Sri Lanka was stagnant at around 59 mt/ha between 1993-2012 before plummeting to an average 42mt/ha between 2013-2015. This is well below those of the top sugar producers.
Strangely, the data indicates that between 2009-15 while sugar cane was harvested no sugar was produced except in one year (2012). Presumably the crop was converted to ethanol, which is even more profitable.
FAO data indicates that average sugarcane yields worldwide are close to 60mt/ha but some countries produce mean crop figures of 100mt/ha and above. Of those major producers who grow in excess of 20 million tons every year, Colombia, Argentina, Australia, Philippines and Brazil usually have mean yields around 80mt/ha or more. Advantages of scale, weather, agricultural practice may all contribute, but for whatever reason the major producers do seem to have a clear advantage over Sri Lanka.
A local producer however enjoys an advantage in being close to the home market; that an importer can ship sugar halfway across the world and sell it cheaper in Sri Lanka is indicative of the extent of the efficiency of the major producers. Unfortunately the tax system prevents Sri Lankan consumers from benefiting from this greater efficiency.
Consumers are forced to pay much higher prices than they should which in effect subsidises the local production. Currently the transfer from consumers to producers is worth about Rs1.25bn rupees a year (at the new rate of tax and assuming a production of 50,000mt) which from the point of view of the sugar industry is a very handsome sum. With such riches on offer it is hardly surprising that the protected domestic market is attracting new interest.
In February this year the press reported that a foreign firm would invest US$152 m in a sugar cane project in the Uva Wellassa region of Sri Lanka. The proposed plantation will occupy about 15,000 ha which is almost double the current extent cultivated and produce 80,000 mt of sugar. Based on current tax rates it will earn a subsidy of Rs.2 bn from Sri Lankan consumers. To put things in perspective, the annual subsidy alone would return 8.5% on the proposed investment of USD152 m.
The subsidy (and profits) will increase further if the tax rate rises, creating the incentive for further lobbying to increase the rate in time to come, burdening consumers further.
Foreign investment is a good thing but there is no good reason why Sri Lankan consumers should subsidise such a project.
Domestic industry consumers
The foreign investor in the new project presumably has access to all the latest technology, plant varieties and skills to be produce sugar efficiently. The investment should not be dependent on continued import protection. If they do not have the technology to compete with world markets should they be investing in the first place
Having fruitlessly spent several decades enriching a domestic industry consumers should not expect to spend several more decades protecting it further. Let the investment come in by all means, but the market for sugar should be free. If there is a tax to be imposed it must be imposed equally on both domestic and imported sugar. The tax system should not create cushy markets for selected industries, who earn easy money at the expense of consumers. This behaviour is termed Rent-Seeking in economics.
There is nothing wrong with a business making profits, but Rent-Seeking (also called crony capitalism), which what happens when selected firms have preferential treatment is bad.
Rent-Seeking is a concept used to describe the activity of individuals or firms who attempt to obtain or maintain wealth-transfers, primarily with the help of the state. More specifically instead of making a productive contribution to an economy, a rent-seeker attempts to obtain benefits for themselves by manipulating the political environment, in this case by ensuring larger margins by taxing competing products from overseas. An activity that is otherwise not viable can suddenly become very lucrative when shielded from competition.
Competitive markets allow a nations resources to be used to best effect in the production of goods and services. For private investment to be a true catalyst for growth markets must be efficient and open. Distorting the market through government policy creates the wrong incentives for investors, opens the door to corruption and leaves consumers worse off.
As they do not create any value, rent-seeking activities impose large costs on an economy that may include unintended consequences such as damaging the environment or destruction of historic sites.
Environmental problems
Prof Gananath Obeysekere in a recent article the sugar project has claimed that the Uva Wellasa region where the new sugar project is proposed will be raped. He says that the area is studded with archeological remains, such as Brahmi inscriptions, drip ledge caves where monks meditated and more developed meditational complexes, ruined viharas and Buddha statues.
Elephants are attracted to certain crops and have a particular fondness for sugarcane. The project will almost double the area under cultivation of sugarcane probably with a multiplier effect on the elephant problem.
Dr. Sumith Pilapitiya onetime leading environmental specialist for South Asia in the World Bank and the former Director General Wildlife maintains that the Pelawatta and Sevanagala sugar projects have encroached into prime elephant habitat and are a source of the human-elephant conflict. Thus protecting an uneconomic local industry at a huge cost to consumers is also harming the environment. If the tax on sugar was rationalised, with local sugar taxed at the same rate as imported sugar the distorted incentive to expand the industry would disappear, solving the associated environmental problems with it.

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had made plans for the development of the health sector for the next three years, while the new Ministry Secretary should be able to implement them without any interruption, a Health Ministry spokesman said.
The Secretary appointed to the position will be on retirement by February and therefore he would be able to work in the position only for around six more months. Having a new Secretary who would be there for the next three years will be an advantage for the Health Ministry to implement the development plans without any interruption, he said.
