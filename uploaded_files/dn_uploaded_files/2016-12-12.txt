Call to regulate trishaw industry
All Island Three Wheeler Drivers Association Chairman Lalith Dharmasekera said it is not fair for the government to impose heavy fines without intervening to regulate the three-wheeler industry.
"We have appealed to the government several times to regulate the three-wheeler industry. But, this has not been done. There is a Gazette notification on the standards of the three-wheelers. But the government is not even implementing it. In addition the registration of three-wheelers has not been properly regulated by the government. Without enforcing those, it is not correct for the government to impose heavy fines, he added. "It is not correct to impose various laws without differentiating between three-wheeler drivers who run hires and drivers who use three-wheelers for their personal purposes. The government should ensure the professional status and protection of the three-wheeler drivers," he said adding that they support the government decision to impose Rs.25,000 fine on offending drivers and drivers should not strike over that.
"The government should provide immediate solutions for the problems persisting in the industry. The bus operators and three-wheeler operators should not have engaged in a strike but they should have discussed their grievances with the authorities to regulate their respective industries. The government has already created a public opinion on the increase of the fine. Therefore, we must make the people aware of our problems, he added.

Joshua to fight Klitschko in April after easy defence
LONDON, Saturday: Britains Anthony Joshua set up an April showdown with veteran heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko on Saturday after retaining his IBF world title with a clinical third round stoppage of outclassed American Eric Molina in Manchester.
After two probing opening rounds, 2012 Olympic super-heavyweight champion Joshua sent his opponent crashing to the canvas for his 18th win inside the distance in as many professional fights.
Molina, 34, clambered unsteadily back to his feet as the count reached eight, but the referee stepped in again to stop the fight after two minutes and two seconds of the round with a technical knockout declared.
The Texan had fought for the world title once before, losing to Deontay Wilder for the WBC belt in 2015. Moments after the fight, promoter Eddie Hearn stepped into the ring to announce an April 29 bout against Ukrainian Klitschko at Londons Wembley Stadium for the unified heavyweight championship of the world.
That can be taken as hyperbole, much as Hearns assertion that it would be the biggest fight in British boxing history, with New Zealander Joseph Parker the newly-crowned WBO champion while American Wilder still holding the WBC belt.
Britains Tyson Fury, who beat Klitschko in November 2015, vacated the WBA and WBO belts in October after having his licence suspended pending investigation of anti-doping and medical issues. He had already been stripped of the IBF belt for not fighting a mandatory challenger.
We move on to a bigger arena, more people can view it. This is the step up people have wanted. Klitschko wants his belts back, may the best man win, said Joshua after his second defence.
Klitschko, who had been watching ringside at the Manchester Arena, stepped through the ropes for some early eyeballing.
He is the best man in the division and I believe this excitement speaks for itself. This is what the fans want and this fight must happen, said the 40-year-old.
He was clear, clean and won by knockout and, as his next opponent, it was good I was here to observe it and make my notes.
The WBA last month officially sanctioned the match between the two fighters for the vacant title.
Saturdays big fight offered less excitement, however, than a toe-to-toe WBC title eliminator on the under card between Britons Dillian Whyte and Dereck Chisora, won by the former on a split-decision.
Khalid Kal Yafai earlier took the WBA super-flyweight world title after outpointing Panamas Luis Concepcion 120-108 119-108 117-110.
Concepcion had already been stripped of the belt after failing to make the weight for the voluntary defence on Friday.

Arsenal go top, Vardy hat-trick lights up Leicester
LONDON, Saturday - Arsenal shoved Chelsea off the top of the table but Leicester Citys Jamie Vardy, with a dazzling hat-trick, was the man of the moment on Saturday as the struggling Premier League champions blew aside Manchester City 4-2.
With Chelsea chasing a ninth win in a row when they host West Bromwich Albion on Sunday, when third-placed Liverpool also host West Ham United, Arsenal seized their chance to take the overall lead by beating Stoke City 3-1 at the Emirates.
The London rivals are now tied on 34 points, and have the same goal difference of 21, but Arsenal edged ahead with 36 goals scored to Chelseas 32.
Vardy, hero of last seasons fairytale title triumph, finally ended his 16-match goalscoring drought for the club with a brace in the first 20 minutes at a rainswept King Power Stadium.
The Foxes, making a nonsense of their miserable recent form, raced into a three-goal lead against Pep Guardiolas expensively assembled side and England striker Vardy completed his first Premier League triple in the 78th from the tightest of angles.
It was the true Leicester today, maybe because we have played so badly in our last few matches, but today we were so strong, happy manager Claudio Ranieri told the BBC.
I am very pleased for Jamie. When he finished I said Oh, welcome back. Manchester City stayed fourth on 30 points and risk being overtaken by Tottenham Hotspur, who take on Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, while Leicester moved up to 14th on 16 points.
On a bumper day for goals, the Premier League saw six home sides score three or more times on a single day for the first time since May 1993.
The goals kept coming at Arsenal, where a rash challenge by Granit Xhaka on Joe Allen gave Charlie Adam the chance to put Stoke ahead from the spot, on the Scots 31st birthday, and he despatched it without fuss. Goals either side of halftime by Theo Walcott and Mesut Ozil, who netted with a rare header, put Arsenal back in front against a side that had never taken a point off them at the Emirates.
Walcott stabbed in Hector Bellerins low cross for the equaliser three minutes before the break and Ozils looping header made it 2-1 five minutes after the interval. Substitute Alex Iwobi then ran through to give Arsenal the two-goal victory they needed to top the table.
At the bottom, troubled West Ham United plunged into the drop zone without kicking a ball after Swansea City won 3-0 at home to Sunderland. The defeat ended Sunderlands run of three wins in four games and sent them back to the basement on 11 points while Swansea clambered clear on 12 and ahead of the Hammers on goal difference.
Swanseas goals came courtesy of a Gylfi Sigurdsson penalty in the 50th and a brace from Fernando Llorente.
The win was Swanseas second under American Bob Bradley, the favourite with British bookmakers to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job, and made it back-to-back victories at the Liberty Stadium for his team. Hull City, who drew 3-3 at home to Crystal Palace, are second from bottom and also on 12 points.
That match was Alan Pardews 300th as a Premier League manager and the Palace boss could crack a smile at the end with Fraizer Campbell grabbing an 89th-minute equaliser to ease the pressure on him.
Hull, who came from 2-1 behind with goals from Adama Diomande in the 72nd and Jake Livermore six minutes later, had been looking good for a win that would have taken them out of the bottom three.
Burnley scored twice in the space of three first-half minutes to beat Bournemouth 3-2 at Turf Moor in the first Premier League meeting between the sides, ending a run of three defeats in a row for the home side.

Ramos stages another late show to snatch dramatic win for Real
BARCELONA, Saturday - Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos again came to his sides rescue as they snatched a dramatic 3-2 victory over Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday to keep Zinedine Zidanes side six points clear at the top of La Liga and set a club record 35 games unbeaten.
Ramos, the scorer of Reals 90th-minute equaliser last week against Barcelona, headed in Toni Kroos corner in the 93rd minute to complete a stunning turnaround after former Real forward Joselu threatened to unravel the unbeaten run.
Joselu struck twice in the space of two minutes to cancel out Alvaro Moratas stunning second-half strike in the 63rd minute and gave Deportivo a shock 2-1 lead in the 65th by knocking in a low cross from Florin Andone.
Real youngster Mariano Diaz scored his first league goal to level in the 88th and preserve the unbeaten run but yet again Ramos had the final say.
When you fight until the end things go your way. They penalised our errors but in the end when you work hard you get results, said Ramos. Im happy that I keep scoring goals and above all we keep completing our objectives.
Zidane, who rested several players, including Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, was also without Gareth Bale, who has an ankle injury -- only the second time since the Welshman joined that Real have been without any of their famous BBC strike force of Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo for a league game.
The win keeps them top of La Liga on 37 points, six clear of nearest challengers Barcelona, who won 3-0 at Osasuna thanks to two second-half strikes from talisman Lionel Messi and an opener from Luis Suarez. Midfield maestro Luka Modric was also rested for the game, and Real struggled to control an end-to-end first half, which saw Deportivos Celso
Borges hit the post and Reals Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez spurn a glorious chance to put the home side ahead. Morata opened the scoring with a wonderful curled shot from outside the
area but Joselu, his old strike partner in Reals reserve team, quickly put Deportivo level by capitalising after Casemiro was dispossessed by Andone. Romanian forward Andone played a vital role in Joselus second goal, too, zipping down the right on a counter and cutting the ball back for the striker to knock through the legs of Keylor Navas.
Zidane turned to Dominican forward Mariano from the bench to get his side out of trouble and his gamble paid off when the 23-year-old scrappily knocked in the equaliser off his shoulder.  Agencies

Hat-trick hero Gayle puts Newcastle back on top
LONDON, Saturday: Dwight Gayle scored a hat-trick as Newcastle United roared back to the top of the Championship on Saturday with a 4-0 thrashing of Birmingham City.
The number nine shirt has always had particular reverence at St James Park, with the likes of Jackie Milburn, Malcolm Macdonald and Alan Shearer having worn it with such distinction for Newcastle down the years.
Now Gayle, who has quickly become the new Tyneside hero since his summer transfer from Crystal Palace, is following in the rich tradition, albeit in Englands second-tier competition, as he took his league-leading tally of goals to 16.
Gayle found the target twice in the space of six minutes halfway through the first half before completing his hat-trick from Jonjo Shelveys 77th-minute pass.
Yoan Gouffran scored Newcastles other goal as Rafa Benitezs buoyant side clambered back one point ahead of Brighton and Hove Albion, who had gone top on Friday night with their 2-0 victory over Leeds United. Reading, enjoying a fine campaign under former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam, kept up their pursuit in third place, earning a 2-1 win over Sheffield Wednesday, with a double from Roy Beerens.
Huddersfield Town are a further four points behind in fourth place after they ended their five-game spell without a win, beating Bristol City 2-1 thanks to a 58th minute winner from Nahki Wells.
Match of the day in the division was a remarkable 4-4 draw between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Fulham at Molineux, with visiting Togolese striker Floyd Ayite heading home the equaliser, his second of the game, in the 94th minute.
There was drama of a different kind at Ipswich Town, where Cardiff City centre-back Sol Bamba exploded with rage after a heavy challenge on him.
The Ivory coast defender confronted his own physio, who was treating him, then other players, the referee and even his manager, Neil Warnock, before taking on the fourth official and eventually being sent off. The match ended in a 1-1 draw.

Seattle Sounders beat Toronto to win MLS Cup
TORONTO: The Seattle Sounders became Major League Soccer champions for the first time with a 5-4 penalty shoot out win over Toronto FC after the MLS Cup final ended goalless after extra-time on Saturday.
Seattle did not make a shot on target throughout 120 minutes of action but defender Roman Torres blasted in the decisive spot-kick to leave the home crowd deflated after Torontos first ever final appearance. It was a largely scrappy encounter but Toronto had the better chances, especially in extra-time where Seattles Swiss keeper Stefan Frei produced a brilliant save to keep out a Jozy Altidore header.
Seattle entered MLS in 2009 and have reached the play-offs in every season but were appearing in their first championship game.
US international striker Altidore went close to an early opener in just the second minute wide when he found a little space on the left but screwed his shot just wide of the far post.
The home side continued to press forward in the early stages with Jonathan Osorio forcing former Toronto keeper Frei into a low save.
Torontos biggest attacking threat, Italian striker Sebastian Giovinco, had two opportunities with free-kicks from distance but both times he struck the ball into the wall.
In the freezing conditions, both sides struggled to find much in the way of fluent possession and while Paraguayan Nelson Valdez showed some good touches for Seattle he lacked real support.
Goalless at the break, Toronto would have been happy with their aggressive work in midfield but they too needed to find a way to better supply their forwards. - AFP

All Blacks great Meads defies cancer with mystery cure
WELLINGTON, Saturday: Legendary All Blacks hardman Colin Meads believes he is winning his battle with cancer with a mystery cure helping him defy medical predictions to stay alive.
The 80-year-old, in his first interview since being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in August, said the cancer had not taken hold as expected and he believed he was beating the illness.
I was upset a little bit with one of the specialists when he gave me a time... A lifespan. I just said to myself well, Ill beat that, he told Newstalk ZB radio on Saturday. I have another check-up next week but Im doing real good. Ive got experts all over the world giving me information. I think Im on my way to recovery.
They cant quite believe it, but theres not too much happening, thats what theyre telling me, and apparently, it should have been. The 1.92 metre (6ft 3in) Meads, nicknamed Pinetree, credited his improvement to a mystery potion.
Dont ask me whats in it, but I call it Taranaki Water. A fella arrived at my door with this stuff and I reckon its doing me real good, he said. He calls it a cure for cancer and he said would you take it This is a dairy farmer, hes got the magic touch I reckon.
When news that Meads had cancer was made public, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key described him as probably the most iconic New Zealander. The lock played 133 games for the All Blacks between 1957 and 1971, and was named New Zealands Player of The Century in 1999.

Crawford cruises to win over Molina in eighth
OMAHA, Saturday: Champion Terence Crawford easily defended his WBO and WBC belts by stopping brawler John Molina in the eighth round of their junior welterweight title fight on Saturday.
Crawford dominated the fight from the opening bell landing precision head shots and bruising body blows through the first seven rounds then taking out the challenger with a series of rights late in the eighth round.
I showed everything in this fight, said Crawford, who improved to 30-0. Give credit to John Molina because he came to fight. The 29-year-old Crawford was rarely tested in his third fight of 2016 in front of his hometown fans as he landed 109 punches through eight rounds compared to just 22 for Molina.
The 2014 fighter of the year said he wants his next fight to be against Filipino champion Manny Pacquiao.
I would love to fight Pacquiao, but it is a business. Right now I want to fight anyone with a title. I want them belts.
If I cant get Pacquiao, I want the belts. Molina showed determination and big heart but he was no match for the quick hands and smooth footwork of Crawford who was the heavy favourite coming into the fight at CenturyLink Center arena.
Crawford pinned a defenceless Molina in the corner, then landed three straight right hands before the referee stepped in and stopped the slaughter as the challenger slumped to the canvas.
Crawford started 2016 with an impressive fifth-round knockout of Henry Lundy in February and followed it up five months later with two knockdowns while cruising to a one-sided decision over Viktor Postol to unify the titles in Las Vegas.
The 33-year-old Molina dropped to 29-7. He earned a shot at the titles by upsetting former champion Ruslan Provodnikov in June.
But Molina did not come close to making the 140-pound weight for his title shot so he would have been denied the belts if he had done the impossible and won. AFP

Champ Charlo stops Williams in fifth round
LOS ANGELES: Unbeaten champion Jermall Charlo stopped previously unbeaten Julian Williams in the fifth round to retain his International Boxing Federation junior middleweight title on Saturday.
The 26-year-old Charlo knocked Williams down three times in the much-anticipated fight en route to a fifth round TKO that improved his record to 25-0, with 19 knockouts.
He sent Williams to the canvas with a punishing right uppercut with 80 seconds left in the fifth round then finished him off with a left hook 26 seconds later.
Williams also got knocked down by a stinging jab in the second round but got up quickly from that one.
He boxed well in rounds three and four before getting careless in the fifth when he walked into an uppercut that sent him crashing to the floor of the Galen Center arena at the University of Southern California. After the fight Charlo refused to shake hands with Williams which attracted boos from the crowd and sparked a yelling match between the two corners.
I told him I want your apology, I dont want your congratulations, Charlo said, furious at Williams pre-fight trash-talk. I never disrespected the dude until I knocked him out, Charlo said.
Despite the three knockdowns, the fight proved to be one of the toughest tests of the career of the unbeaten champion.
Williams, 26, suffered the first defeat of his career as he dropped to 22-1-1 with 14 knockouts.
This was a fight many boxing fans had anxiously awaited since Williams became the mandatory No. 1 challenger in March after knocking out Marcello Matano in the seventh round of a title eliminator.- AFP

Salt and coffee used to hide tainted Russian doping samples
LONDON, Saturday: Doping mastermind-turned-whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov used salt, coffee and water to cover up drug failures but his secret service links did not hide all the signs of Russias dubious bid for sporting glory.
Tiny scratches inside the bottles of urine samples which were switched by an FSB intelligence agent during the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics gave the cheating game away, according to the investigation published Friday by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren.
The former head of Moscows main anti-doping laboratory, now in hiding in the United States, had to resort to desperate measures because of the potential time bomb of being found out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), the report said.
Rodchenkov was an FSB intelligence agent as well as laboratory director who took charge of doping which McLaren said started in 2011 at the latest. Part of his job was to report on WADA activities to the secret service.
The report said Russian officials started to panic about the risks of being caught in the run-up to the London Olympics which McLaren said was corrupted on an unprecedented scale.
It indicated that sports minister of the time, Vitaly Mutko, now a deputy prime minister, was implicated in the events.
Rodchenkov was absent through illness for much of 2011. After Dr. Rodchenkovs return, various steps and actions were initiated by the (ministry of sport) under the leadership and knowledge of both Minister Mutko and Deputy Minister Nagornykh, with direct involvement of the Federal Security Service (FSB), said the report.
Russia was particularly anxious about the London Olympics and Rodchenkov developed a cocktail that would make banned substances more difficult to detect.
WADA stepped up testing of Russian athletes from May to July 2012. McLaren said positive tests were reported to the sports ministry and false results sent to the WADA computerised system.
Rodchenkov realised he was sitting on a potential time bomb when WADA requested that 67 samples meant to be stored in Moscow be sent to the Lausanne laboratory for new tests.
He knew that 10 of the samples on the list were dirty but had only clean urine for eight of the athletes involved.
He added salt and coffee to put off WADA experts.
He (Rodchenkov) altered the clean A samples either by diluting with water, adding salt, sediment or Nescafe granules when needed to match the specific gravity and appearance of the dirty B samples, McLaren said.
Experts quoted in the report said up to a teaspoonful of salt was added to some samples.
The report named Anastasiya Kapachinskaya, who won a silver in the Russian 4x400m womens relay team in Beijing in 2008, and Darya Pishchalnikova, who took silver in the womens discus in London, as two of the athletes involved.
Rodchenkov said that Pishchalnikova was considered untouchable throughout her career, meaning that none of her samples would or could be reported positive.
The report said the sports ministry, FSB and Rodchenkov decided in 2013 to develop a system to replace urine in samples taken at events so it would be ready for the Sochi Olympics.
The FSB was put on a project to remove and replace the bottle caps from the sample bottles. It became known as the Disappearing Positive Methodology.
Rodchenkov described instruments, no bigger than a traditional Mont-Blanc pen, and similar to the instruments that a dentist would use in examining teeth, with a handle and thin metallic portion that was bent at various angles.
A clean bank of urine from athletes was also set up so doping failures could be replaced. The clean urine was carried around in Coke and baby bottles, the report said.
According to the whistleblower, the 2013 world athletics championships in Moscow and the world university games in Kazan were used as rehearsals for Sochi.
At the 2014 Winter Games, six Paralympic athletes who won a total of 21 medals all had their samples swapped, the report said. At the Olympics, two athletes who won four gold medals and a female silver medal winner had samples with salt readings that were physiologically impossible.
Two womens ice hockey players provided samples with male DNA.  AFP

One Direction's Louis Tomlinson's mother dies at 43

One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson's mother has died from leukaemia aged 43.
Johannah Deakin passed away on Wednesday (7) at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital.
Earlier this year she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the blood cancer and had been at a hospital in London since May.
She had seven children and worked as a midwife. Her partner Dan said in a statement that "she would always look to put other people before herself ".
Johannah split from her ex-partner, Mark Tomlinson, around the time that Louis was auditioning for The X Factor in 2010 after they'd had four children together.
She had 24-year-old Louis with first husband Troy Austin
Louis kept first step-dad Mark Tomlinson's surname but his mum remarried last year.
Johannah became a grandmother after Louis' former partner Briana Jungwirth gave birth to his first child, Freddie, in January.
The One Direction singer split from the US model before Freddie was born and is now in a new relationship.
The family statement on Johannah continues: "She desired nothing more than for everyone around her to be happy and loving.
"She worked tirelessly on numerous charity campaigns, creating memories for many individuals and their families.
"It wasn't uncommon for Johannah to hear through the media of an individual in need of assistance.
"She would immediately make it her objective to get that person what they often desperately needed, and rarely without success."
The family has asked for privacy and space in the weeks ahead.
The family also thanked University College London Hospital where Johannah had been treated since May and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, where she'd been cared for during her final weeks.
As well as Louis, Johannah leaves behind six other children - Lottie, 18, Felicite, 16, plus two sets of twins, Phoebe and Daisy, 12, and two-year-olds Ernest and Doris.
