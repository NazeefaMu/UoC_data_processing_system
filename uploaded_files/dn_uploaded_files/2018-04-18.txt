Embracing everybody  Commonwealth boss signals Games rebranding
Gold Coast, Monday: Commonwealth Games Federation president Louise Martin urged all multi-sports tournaments to follow its lead and have equal medals for men and women as she insisted the competition still had a role in the modern era. Martin said a rebranding exercise is under way for the Olympic-style event, which started as the British Empire Games in 1930 but is now keen to stress its promotion of "humanity, equality and destiny".
The just-concluded Gold Coast Commonwealth Games in Australia had medal equality between men and women for the first time and a para-competition was integrated into the main programme.
Asked about the image of the Games as a relic from bygone times, Martin told AFP:
"Those who come from that era still think of it like that but now where we are in the modern Commonwealth, we are moving forward and we're embracing everybody.
"We're becoming more relevant than we've ever been before and what we're trying to do is ensure that everybody else in the world sees exactly what we're trying to do," she said in an interview.
"(We promote) our values of humanity, equality and destiny and encourage everybody else to do the same."Martin said other multi-sports events should also shift to medal parity between men and women, although this year's Pyeongchang Winter Olympics had a record number of women and close to a 50-50 split between the sexes.
"Wake up, we're all in this together," she said, asked about the importance of having an equal number of medals.
"I think every other event should be trying to do the same so they have to make the programme, they have to look at scheduling and make sure that the male events don't dominate the female events.
"So we've managed it and other sports can do it too."
Duel in the Pool
The Games also featured their first transgender athlete, New Zealand weightlifter Lauren Hubbard, who was warmly welcomed by the crowd and also endorsed by organisers.
"As far as I'm concerned we're fully inclusive," Martin said. However, there was also a series of protests by indigenous activists who dubbed them the "Stolenwealth Games", a reference to Britain's colonisation of Australia. And there appeared to be discomfort when English diver Tom Daley, who is gay, pointed out that homosexuality remains illegal in 37 Commonwealth countries and territories. As part of the revamp, Martin said she was also considering Duel in the Pool-style offshoots, potentially lining up the Commonwealth against major powers in sports such as swimming or athletics. "We're in the process of talking about these things and yes, we want to take the Commonwealth slightly further," she said, taking inspiration from swimming's Duel, which pitted the United States against Australia or Europe.
"What we're trying to do is make sure that these athletes can get to compete against, say, the Americas or... one other country that we can have a fantastic competition with, like Duel in the Pool. "Or an athletics event so that everybody can see the standard that we have within the Commonwealth."
She added: "When you start to see the athletes that have come here and the standard that they are, we can compete with anyone anywhere. And I think (they would be) fun events." AFP

Excise Week brings 3,350 suspects to book
Illicit liquor, valued at Rs. 10 million, was seized by the Excise Department along with 3,350 suspects, during a special week-long programme implemented to nab liquor smugglers around the country.
The programme was held from April 9 to 15, which was named the Excise Week, said Deputy Excise Commissioner Kapila Kumarasingha. The programme was implemented by the Departments Commissioner General R. Semasingha.
As a result of the programme, 151 liquor manufacturing centres, 1,680 suspects in possession and involved with the sale of illegal liquor, 739 outlets selling foreign liquor, 341 outlets selling ganja and cocaine,193 outlets selling cigarettes but had failed to pay duty tax as well as several alcohol and drug smugglers were raided and arrested by Excise officials.
Out of the raids conducted in the country, 103 raids were conducted in Negombo, 116 in Kurunegala, 195 in Moneragala and 101 in the Southern Province. The Colombo Excise Special Operations Unit conducted 141 raids during the week, said the Deputy Excise Commissioner.
The remanded suspects will be produced before the relevant Magistrates Courts on April 27.
In addition, charges were made against 74 liquor outlets, which breached the terms and conditions of licensing. These outlets included hotels, restaurants, canteens and karaoke centres. The licenses would be abolished or penalties would be imposed on these centres.
The operations were carried out under the instructions of the Commissioner General, led by the Deputy Excise Commissioner M. B. Wanasuriya.

SLFP should quit Government
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) should quit the Government. The Prime Minister has 122 members on his side enabling him to carry out governance on his own, former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said.
He was attending the court session of Mahindananda Aluthgamage at the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court.
After Presidents arrival to the country, all the parliamentarians expect to gather for a discussion, the former minister said.
The attempt of the government to remand former Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for the embezzlement of funds amounting to Rs. 39 million was made because we voted for the No Confidence Motion (NCM) to remove the Prime Minister from office, former Highways State Miniser Dilan Perera said.
The citizens have faith in the court and the court system should stand firmly on its own. There is no such thing as a joint opposition. Any party could come and join us, he said

You beauty - Bolt on the decks  as Games spin to a close
GOLD COAST, Sunday - Usain Bolt took a turn as DJ as the Gold Coast said goodbye to the Commonwealth Games on Sunday after an 11-day tournament where Australia topped the medals table by a distance.
Bolt made a surprise appearance on the decks as the Games closed in a colourful ceremony with references to Aboriginal culture -- although indigenous protests continued outside.
Australia finished with 80 golds, way ahead of England's 45 and India's 26, in a tally that integrated para sports and was equally split between men and women for the first time.
"For those who delivered this event I say, 'You beauty! You did us proud," said Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, as the Commonwealth flag was handed to 2022 hosts Birmingham. Australia dominated in the swimming pool and in track cycling, while Jamaica felt the absence of the retired Bolt as they struggled in the sprint events.
The Games also featured their first transgender athlete, and gay English diver Tom Daley caused a stir when he urged the 37 Commonwealth countries that outlaw homosexuality to change their laws.
Zero failed drug tests were reported during the event, although India twice fell foul of the Games' 'no needle policy' and had two athletes ordered home.
However, the Games also saw several protests from indigenous activists who dubbed them the "Stolenwealth Games", a reference to Britain's colonisation of Australia.
On Sunday about 100 protesters were blocked from marching to the stadium by a heavy police presence, preventing a repeat of the tense confrontation before the opening ceremony.
'BIG QUESTIONS'

Earlier, organisers were criticised for their medical response after marathon runner Callum Hawkins collapsed only two kilometres (just over a mile) from victory and lay prone for some time before help arrived.
Officials in turn lashed out at spectators who took pictures of Hawkins as he lay in distress. Australia's Michael Shelley ran past the Scot on his way to victory.
Marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe tweeted that there were "big questions" for the organising committee and medical staff.
"That should never happen," she said.
The Games have been painted by organisers as Australia's chance to burnish its image for sportsmanship after a Test cricket cheating scandal which shocked the nation.
Australia also suffered setbacks on the last day when their women's rugby team, the Olympic champions, lost a sudden-death thriller against New Zealand in the inaugural final. Kelly Brazier scored from inside her own half to clinch it 17-12 in the first extra period and avenge New Zealand's defeat to Australia in the 2016 Olympic title decider. Heavy favourites Australia were also stunned by England in gripping fashion when Helen Housby scored the winning goal in the last second to make it 52-51.
However, Australia thrashed Canada 87-47 in the men's basketball final, Shelley won the marathon and David Palmer and Zac Alexander were crowned men's doubles squash champions on the final day.
Helalia Johannes won the women's marathon in 2:32.40, becoming Namibia's first female gold medallist at the Commonwealth Games. Malaysia's Lee Chong Wei fought back from a game down to beat India's newly crowned world number one Kidambi Srikanth in the men's badminton final.
Saina Nehwal won an all-Indian women's badminton final against P.V. Sindhu, and Singapore finished with table tennis success in the men's singles and mixed doubles.  AFP

Most Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhamma Anu Nayake Thera:
Unique service for religious and cultural resurgence
The Most Venerable Deputy Patriarch (Anu Nayake) of the Malwatte Chapter of the Siam Sect, Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhammbhidhna Anu Nayake Thera attained 77 years of age recently. The Ven. Anu Nayake Thera rendered unique and great service for the religious, cultural and social resurgence of the country, which will be long remembered and valued by the people of Sri Lanka and is sure to be recorded in our history in golden letters.
Seventy-seven years ago, two days after the Sinhala and Tamil New Year (April 16, 1941), a son was born to Rambandara Nilame and Dingiri Amma Menike Kumarihamy, who resided at Bajjala Walawwa in the village of Dimbulkumbure, Hanguranketha, in Nuwara Eliya district.
The boy had his basic education in the village school and later was moved to Sri Sangaraja Pirivena affiliated to Malwathu Maha Viharaya in Kandy. While he was studying as a lay student at Sri Sangaraja Pirivena, on December 30, 1965, he was ordained at Malwathu Maha Viharaya and took name Dimbulkumbure Wimaladhamma, under the tutelage of Ven. Mtgamuwe Dhammaloka Nayake Thera, Ven. Ilukwatte Dhammananda Thera and Ven. Waturakumbure Gnanawimala Thera. He received his higher ordination on the same day at the Uposathagaraya of Malwathu Maha Viharaya.
In 1970, Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera entered the University of Colombo and obtained a special degree in History. After completing his studies, Ven. Anu Nayake Thera began his career as a teacher at Sri Nishshanka Vidyalaya in Nuwara Eliya district and later served at Dodamwala Vidyalaya in Kandy district and Ambagamuwa Vidyalaya in Nuwara Eliya. In 1986, he was promoted as the Principal of Waturakumbura Vidyalaya, Kandy and rendered an excellent service in this capacity till 2001.
After the passing away of his teachers, Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera was appointed as the Chief Incumbent of the historical temples of Gereppitiya in the Yatinuwara area and Ranawana in the Pilimatalawa area. He was entrusted with the Thewawa ceremony of Sri Dalada Maligawa, which is a highly respected task among the Buddhist monks. He was appointed to perform these religious rituals several times under the guidance of the Mahayake Theras at the time.
Ven. Thera was appointed as a member of Supreme Sangha Council (Kraka Sangha Sabha) of the Malwatte Chapter of the Siam Sect by Royal Pandit Most Ven. Sirimalwatte Sri Ananda Mahanayake Thera. Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera has provided his invaluable service for the annual Upasampada ceremony of Malwathu Viharaya as a Karmawgchrya and a Updyya for several decades. He was elevated to the position of Deputy Registrar of the Malwatte Chapter in 2004. The Supreme Sangha Council of the Malwatte Chapter conferred on him the prestigious position of Anu Nayake in 2009. The Most Venerable Anu Nayake Thera was made the Chief Incumbent of the historical Royal Temple of Walgampya in 2016.
Ven. Dimbulkumbure Sri Wimaladhamma Anu Nayake Thera who had the greatness to address all the people who came to him with a heart of loving kindness, thus living up to Buddhist social concepts, merited to be a prominent custodian of the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha, which is the most sacrosanct relic of worship of the entire Buddhist world.
May the blessings of the Triple Gem be bestowed on the Anu Nayake Thera to live many more years in fostering the Sambuddha Ssana.

Chandralekha Vijayalakshmi Mendis:
A model of patience
It has been one year since you said goodbye forever and left us. It was wonderful to see you patiently listening to bana every day and teaching us the dharma, while reminding us that sooner or later, we would leave this world. You were always ready for it, as you had given up all your worldly possessions. Even to the last day of your life, your mind was razor-sharp and you did not forget to wish your friends.
The way you looked after your parents, visiting them every month when they were living and observing sil even when you were bedridden and unable to walk, always inquiring about their health and needs, showed how patient you were with everybody around you. Now that you are no more in our midst, all that we can do is thank you for your wonderful life and to remember you today.
We will never forget you and will always cherish those happy memories when you were a part of our family. On April 16, it was be one year since you left us, but we will always keep your memory alive. Words cannot describe how much we still miss you and we continue the good deeds and meritorious activities you initiated and had been doing. May those fond memories not fade away as we complete another year since you bade goodbye.
A perfect rose among lesser flowersA golden moment among dull hoursA wonderful lifewarm and trueWe think of these when we think of you
Your son, husband and all your family members
Rashi Perera:
An angel guiding us from heaven
Darling Rashi, you became my son on December 23, 1999 and you were my joy giver during your infancy. During your childhood we were playmates. When you became little bit older, with your outstanding performance in studies, sports and music, you were my achiever and entertainer. You were ever my reliable friend and advisor whenever I faced a challenge. From the day that you took your heavenly assignment on April 15, 2013, you became my special guardian angel.
Five years have passed by and all our loved ones might feel that Thaththi and Ammi (Ruwini) must be in control of that past dreadful event. But my dear Angel, you know the correct picture. Each and every time I drive to work, I still remember dropping you at school; whenever we go shopping, I still recall how you used to climb on the trolley for me to push. Each time we attend a party, I still cherish the good old days that we partnered together providing sensational music to lift the party spirit, and at church, the way you stood between us with your innocent smile. These are the cherished moments that we miss dearly. For all these times, I have only one prayer to say to the Almighty, Thy will be done  you know whats best.
As a God-fearing young lad, your spiritual life on earth is indeed a great lesson to us. Your desire to be sinless while forgiving others who did injustice to you, set us an example on how to meet Gods expectations. Your great kindness for the poor, sympathy towards the needy, compassion for the under-privileged children, understanding of others agony, are just a few qualities that you had and are very rare to find in todays world. Furthermore, your prayerful life with immense hope and faith in the Almighty God, exhibits your heavenly assignment on earth.
I still browse through the heaps of certificates that you were awarded for studies; remembering the hours you spent with your mother, studying vigorously to become the best in class. I still recollect the trophies you won for sports and other activities that exhibited your sheer determination, strength and endurance. Though Im not a great musician like you, I still keep your instruments in good condition while playing a few songs to bring back your sweet memory. Darling, you are my role model who used your God-given talent to the maximum, and Im trying my level best to keep the life back at home in filling the massive void you left behind.
My darling Rashi, at the time you were born, you were crying and we all were smiling and celebrating with absolute joy. But at the time of your demise, we were all shedding tears in sheer misery, but surely, you were smiling at that time, since you were in the heavenly realm knowing you are in a better place. Many a time when I was depressed, you appeared in my dreams to greatly console and strengthen me. Full credit for the continuity of my life since you left us five years ago, is owed to you, my son.
During the past five years, I have realised the wondrous ways in which our Lord acts in ones life. At a time when society was testing my faith due to your sudden departure, I was privileged to become even closer to God and praise His phenomenal ways of doing things. Due to the continuous faith Ammi and I had, the Almighty gave us a beautiful son, very much like you, of whom I know, you were fully aware of well in advance. I am sure your prayers from heaven helped us to have your beautiful brother Jevon (which means gift of God).
Im fully aware that your assignment with God is for the entire humankind, but your prayers and guidance to me, Ammi and our family is immensely valued. By now you are aware of my destiny and I seek your guidance and support to reach there and to achieve the ultimate goal of meeting you in heaven once again. Until we meet you in person in the heavenly kingdom, please do intercede for us to walk closely with our Lord, Jesus Christ.
I earnestly thank the Holy Spirit for giving me the strength and knowledge to write these few lines to you and always pray that you will be in eternal peace in the arms of Jesus and the holy ones.
Lovingly,
Thaththi (Malin Perera)
Dixon Wanigasekera:
Loving Papa to his grandchildren
I was very saddened to hear that Dixon Wanigasekera passed away recently, while he was holidaying in Sri Lanka. I last spoke to him over the telephone, just before his 90th birthday, in Canada, where he lived with his wife Indra (who is a relative of the Corea family). The Wanigasekera family celebrated his 90th birthday in a big way.
Uncle Dixon told me he had still kept the newspaper cuttings of some articles I had written about him in the Daily News in August 1980, when I met him and his daughter Malki when they were visiting Sri Lanka at the time. Previous to that meeting, I remember meeting them when they visited Sri Lanka in 1974. They left Sri Lanka for Canada in 1967 and visited us to bid us goodbye when we were living in Maha Nuge Gardens in Colombo.
Dixon joined the Canadian National Railway and worked as a draughtsman in the Engineering Department. I also remember him being a great cook, mastering the art of Sri Lankan cuisine in Canada.
He passed away on Friday, March 30, 2018, while in Sri Lanka. He leaves behind his devoted wife, Indra, children Damayanthi (Jocelyn), Dinesh (Alisa) and Malkanthi (Gary). He was very much a loving Papa to Matthew, Angela, Dillon and Marc. Dixon was a loving brother to nine siblings and fun-loving uncle to several nieces and nephews.
May he rest in peace in the arms of Jesus.

Freddie Alles:
A gentleman to the core
It is almost three months since our dear friend Freddie left us. Freddie left a little too early, but his was a life well lived. A chartered accountant by profession, he was more a man of automobiles than of accounts. Freddie was a walking encyclopaedia on automobiles be it vintage, classic, sports or modern luxury cars. His collection of cars included the rarest models of Rolls Royce, Borgward Isabella, DKW, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, MG, Daimler, Mercedes, Opel Rekord, Opel Kapitan, Citroen, Jaguar, Jowett Javelin and many more.
His cars were not merely for show, for he used his cars regularly, for private running all over the country and also at the many Sunday runs, which he almost never missed. Freddie used to talk fondly about how he started his collection with a Fiat 500, 4 Sri 4080 for Rs. 5000 whilst working at Hayleys and how he used to race his MG in his younger days.
After his death early this year, his friend Nimal Wimalasuriya wrote in Motormaglanka.lk: In the month of February, the classic/vintage car community of Sri Lanka lost one of its ardent fans. One could describe Freddie Alles with a myriad of titles associated with classic/vintage cars such as a collector, historian, enthusiast and even a walking encyclopaedia, but the most apt title that one could give him was gentleman.
Freddie was indeed that, a gentleman to the core. He was one of the founder members of the Mercedes Benz Club of Sri Lanka, founded in 1990 and was the President of the Club again in the year 2017, having being its President earlier too. He was one of the strongest pillars of the Mercedes Benz Club. He was also an active member of the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, a senior member of the Vintage Car Club of Ceylon, member of the Italian Car Enthusiasts Club and also a member of several international automobile clubs. Freddie was an asset to any club as he got involved in all aspects of club activities with absolute dedication and passion.
I first met Freddie long years ago at the Mercedes Benz Club and we gradually became close friends. In the last couple of years, not a day passed by where we had not contacted each other, either by phone, email or Whatsapp and I just cannot bring myself to erase those records from my phone. We exchanged messages even as late as January this year, and all those messages are still intact in my phone.
Freddie was always there for a friend and many a time when I had some little issue with an old car and phoned him to get his advice, he would be at my place, sometimes within minutes, to help me out. He made time for people and his knowledge of automobiles was amazing.
Freddie was a warm, down to earth human being. He had a habit of coming up to the car to see you off and even in his last days, suffering with acute pain, he would still walk us to the car to say goodbye. He helped car enthusiasts in every way possible, and some were barely known to him. He helped anyone who asked for help or had a problem. Freddie helped people and causes quietly. He was closely associated with the Sri Lanka Cancer Society and served in many capacities including that of its President.
His love for his family was as intense and all encompassing as his love of cars. He would often send us photos of the frequent road trips he used to take with family, of his visits to car museums and car shows from all over the world, of his beloved children and grandchildren, and of him and Shanthi, his beloved wife or of his racing days. He thought the world of his family.
The motoring fraternity lost a true motoring enthusiast; the family, a much loved husband, father, a grandfather, a brother; and we lost a true friend, a man with a golden heart.
May God bless his soul!

Most. Ven. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera: Simple and pure, worthy of emulation Simple flower! Though not genetically modified, Many took you for one Owing to the diversity you displayed. You were supple as a rose Yet, stood erect as a hydrangea That doesnt bow the head to Sun, moon and rain. Though a choice flower, You maintained a low profile As a tiny Jasmine, Simple and pure too. You released your fragrance With utmost restraint, Making it almost imperceptible, Which enabled you to transcend The narrow denominational boundaries. You were as comfortable At the altar of a church, Within the precincts of a mosque, Or in a Hindu temple, As on the Mal Asanaya in a Buddhist temple. At a time when Myriads of mediocre flowers of bold hues (either planted or mushroomed) Fills the atmosphere With their strong, obnoxious scents, Absence of a worthy flower like you For emulation Is a loss the country cannot afford to suffer.

To be or Knot  to be to the fore
The Sri Theatre is back on stage with an all-new play for Theatre lovers in Sri Lanka. It has been awhile since their last production Anarchy a play that we toured to Galle for the first time last year. This year they have packaged a rib-tickling comedy about a young girl forced into marriage with a boy she barely knows. Rukaiya is ambitious and smart however she fears that marriage might dampen her spirits.
But what to do
The couple must get to know each other or they are to head for a divorce in no time. They must way love over the trust, destiny over free will, the new world over the old.
The play revolves around a Muslim family. This is one of the first times in Sri Lankan theatre that non-Muslims have the opportunity to enjoy the inconsistencies and jolly traditions observed by Muslims. The writer who likes to call himself an Existentialist Muslim believes that it is Gods given right to man that he questions his environment. If God wanted blind followers he would simply have engineered automatic solar-powered robots, but then he didnt. a line from the play.
The first step to any form of reconciliation is to be able to laugh at ourselves believes Aslam the writer of To Be or Knot to be.
The cast for this play will include Sri Theatre company regulars Ruwanthi as Zeena, Anaz as Feroze, Siddath as Nazeer and Rochana as Rukaiya.
Sri theatre company believes that this play will change the way people think about anothers religion and realize that in Sri Lanka all religions adhere to a uniquely Lankan set of taboos and traditions.
The play will be staged at the Trinity College Hall on April 27 and 28 at 7.30 pm.

Best care from Asiri  Breast Care Centre
Globally, the rising rate of the occurrence of cancers is very disturbing. In Sri Lanka too, a marked increase in the reported cases of the disease has been witnessed especially breast cancer - the highest contributor with over 4000 new cases reported annually.
However, it has been documented that mortality from this disease can be reduced through early detection, by emphasising the importance of routine screening.
For any woman, discovering a breast lump is frightening, yet over 90% are benign. In the event it is not, early detection followed by treatment and care through an experienced, multi-disciplinary professional approach is vital. This helps to minimise patient anxiety in addition to using the least radical treatment approaches delivering the best outcomes.
The Asiri Breast Care Centre, located at Central Hospital, Colombo offers a unique, friendly and relaxed atmosphere designed to ensure diagnosis, offering the best possible assessment and treatment.
The importance for women to participate in breast screening activities cannot be highlighted enough as although it is primarily a disease affecting only half the population, it is the commonest cancer in Sri Lanka.
All women should avail themselves of the easily available screening facilities which are primarily non-invasive, with no injections used, very little radiation emitted and at relatively low cost.
Screening offers high specificity and helps filter-off early cancers accurately. By undergoing a mammography, the chances of missing cancer is very low.
Though Sri Lankan women do not have access to an established screening programme in the state sector, unlike most developed countries, the screening test for cervical cancer, commonly known as the Pap smear, is freely available.The widespread use of Pap smear tests along with vaccination has reduced deaths due to cervical cancer.
Screening is also encouraged because it saves lives and if detected early can be treated with an aim to cure and save breasts by avoiding operations that involve the removal of breasts.
It is recommended that all women from the age of 40-70 should screen for breast cancer. They are invited to walk-in to the Centre and staff will arrange for a mammogram.However, an ultrasound scan may be required in some cases for further assessment.
Reviewing the results, the Centre offers a comprehensive approach based on a patients individual circumstances.
The centre conducts a triple assessment which is clinical, imaging and histopathology before we confirm a diagnosis of breast cancer. This includes the patients history, the results of the examination, the imaging and histopathology test, where a sample of the affected area is looked at under a microscope. Multiple consultants then sit as a panel and tailor what is best for that patient and take it from there.
The Centre also advocates for continuous awareness and education among women. Breast awareness is strongly recommended where a woman should be aware of her risk factors and have regular self-breast examinations. Advice includes looking for changes systematically and regularly, looking for pain, disfigurement, etc. If there are changes individual should speak to a doctor.
Mothers are encouraged to train their daughters in breast examination from a young age because breasts change throughout a womans life. This self-examination should be done regularly  when done routinely, changes can easily be picked up. This, in turn, leads to early detection and can save lives.
The Centre also addresses all other breast-related issues such as benign breast diseases and cosmetic concerns such as breast augmentation, reduction and gender transition.
The Asiri Breast Care Centresmulti-disciplinary team comprises of consultant surgeons, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, nurses and other experienced health professionals, offering the best possible assessment and treatment for all breast-related concerns and issues.
Professionalism and ethics are core values in all the Centres practices. All consultations will be chaperoned by female staff and the confidentiality of clinical material is ensured.

Beware Dengue this  monsoon!
Lanka Hospitals recently convened a media conference at its auditorium to enlighten the masses on the threat of a dengue outbreak during the upcoming monsoon season. The media conference was held under the patronage of a panel comprising Consultant Paediatrician Dr. Samantha de Silva and Consultant Physicians Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama and Dr. Mahesh Harischandra.
Commenting on the matter, Dr. S. Rathnapriya  Director Medical Services of Lanka Hospitals stated As one nation we need to take corrective measures to prevent Dengue and spread awareness to take sufficient measures on Dengue prevention. Dr. Rathnapriya also stressed that Media could play an important role of taking the message to the Public and educating the masses wisely.
Due to inclement weather and intermittent rains, the threat of dengue outbreak was on the rise in the recent times. In order to prevent the situation from arising once again, the discussion brought to light the importance of individual awareness on the disease. Further, it was emphasized on adopting a healthy lifestyle to prevent the spread of dengue and undergoing specific tests to correctly identify the illness. This is to prevent recurrence of dengue fever, particularly for those with dengue symptoms, those who contracted the illness or those who recovered from the illness.
During the media conference, attention was drawn to the matter of pursuing home or native remedies without seeking professional medical attention to cure dengue fever. In response, the resource panel from Lanka Hospitals stated that its vital to consult a doctor and that the patient should refrain from exertion, ascertaining that dengue fever can be completely cured.
Furthermore, the panel also stated that the western medical practitioners do not recommend papaya leaf juice for the treatment of patients with dengue fewer or suspect dengue fewer.
The attendees were enlightened on the methods and means of prevention, where attention was drawn on how each Sri Lankan can contribute proactively to the valuable cause. The panel further underscored that by maintaining clean environments through ongoing community clean-up campaigns, potential dengue breeding habitats can be eliminated;adding that this stands as the only solution to the problem.
Placing strong emphasis on the importance of prevention than treatment, Lanka Hospitals went beyond the periphery of a hospital to launch a proactive widespread awareness drive among the masses on prevention and management of dengue fever. Many representatives from Lanka Hospitals PLC as well as from media institutions were present at the occasion.

Bradby Fiesta back for the fifth year
As April approached and the holiday mood kicked in, the school rugby season has also reached its peak of excitement. Arguably the most anticipated of the events in Colombo is the Bradby Leg that is played between Royal College, Colombo and Trinity College, Kandy. It is not essential to be a part of these two prestigious schools as the oldest rugby encounter in the country is now more of a social gathering than a game of rugby.
In conjunction with the Colombo Leg of the 74th Bradby Shield, the Royal College Union (RCU) has for the last five years organized the Bradby Fiesta, a carnival that embodies the fun, camaraderie and exhilarating atmosphere of the game itself. This year the Brady Fiesta will be held at the Bloomfield Grounds adjacent to the Royal Sports Complex on April 21 from 9 am to 12 midnight.
The Bradby Fiesta was originally organized by the RCU to accommodate those who miss the opportunity to witness the live action at the venue - due to seating constraints. Our aim is to allow everyone to experience the game live on giant screens placed at Bloomfield Grounds. The screens will come alive as soon as kick off takes place at 5:30 pm so no one misses even a minute of the excitement. We have also included a lot of new entertainment options for the entire family this year, said a spokesperson for Bradby Fiesta.
Milo Kids Zone
Milo has been a long-term partner with the Bradby Fiesta and returns this year to power their dedicated Kids Zone packed with fun, games and activities for the young ones. The game that was once enjoyed just by the fathers is today an event of entertainment for the entire family. Starting off from 9 am the Milo Kids Zone will have a wide array of fun games for kids with many attractive and exciting giveaways including mountain bicycles. The Kids Zone will also feature a Breakfast Zone, fun and energy moves, and a fun selfie corner.
Milo together with the Organizers has also paid special attention to create games that stimulate both mind and body of those who will be participating.
Under 10 Tag Rugby Tournament
For the first time this year, Milo and the RCU will also host a Tag Rugby Tournament for the Under 10 age category. Schools and rugby academies including Royal, Trinity, S.Thomas, S. Peters, S. Josephs, Wesley, D S Senanayake, Mahanama, Zahira, Thurstan and Presidents College, and the Summa Navaratnam Academy and A Goal Academy will take part in the tournament. This tournament will not only be fun and entertainment but will also promote and infuse the need amongst the players of tomorrow to take up the game of rugby seriously.
Sports Medicine Camp
In another first this year, the RCU together with a leading hospital will host a special sports medicine camp.
Professional sports medicine practitioners will provide spot analysis on sports-related injuries, teach on how to avoid and treat on-field injuries and even prescribe physiotherapy sessions for the more serious cases. This medical camp will be open o both young and old alike.
Never-Ending Party
With Sun FM as the Offical Radio Partner, this years Bradby Fiesta will have non-stop entertainment from morning till midnight. Celebrate no matter which side wins together with Dj Mira  a Ukranian born female DJ, renowned bands like Black and the Slipping Chairs, and a crazy bunch of DJs aptly calling themselves DJ Lunatics. With a magnificent fireworks display, this is one party you do not want to miss.
Hawkers Street Food
More than 30 vendors spanning 5-star hotels, Colombos favourite food chains and street food will provide a true Hawker Street experience throughout the day. Food from all corners of the world will flow in abundance for the entire family to enjoy before, during and after the game.

Tribute to Dr. H. W. Jayewardene, QC:
Brilliance personified
Twenty-eight years ago on April 19, 1990 Dr. H. W. Jayewardene, QC a colossus in the legal profession, passed away whilst on a visit to India. It was the end of an innings of a great legal luminary Sri Lanka had produced. It was a loss not only to his wife Claribel, son, daughters, in laws and grandchildren but to the legal fraternity at large.
Dr. H. W. Jayewardene was an advocate par excellence, and at the time of his death, had completed 49 successful years at the bar. Born to a family of lawyers, Dr. Jayewardene was conferred silk at an early age. Fame and success came to him within a short period with hard work. The civil law was his forte and the later years of his practice was dedicated to the appellate courts where he excelled in every case he appeared. The law reports of Sri Lanka and England bear ample testimony to his brilliance.
The legal fraternity of Sri Lanka owes a deep gratitude to Dr Jayewardene for his contribution to the legal profession in many ways. When the Bar Association of Sri Lanka came into being in 1975, he was its first President. When there was a move by the then government to shift the courts from Hulftsdorp to Bambalapitiya, it was Dr. Jayewardene an energetic lawyer who steered the opposition with success.
Superior Courts Complex in Hulftsdorph
He was instrumental in getting the Government of China to construct the Superior Courts Complex in Hulftsdorph which to-date house the several appellate courts, the Supreme Courts, including the ceremonial Supreme Court, the judges chambers, the Ministry of Justice etc. Even the trees that stand in the said superior courts complex were planted under the strict stewardship of Dr. Jayewardene. Many others in his position would have wished to get their names inscribed in a prominent place in the Court Complex for posterity, but not he. Dr. H. W. Jayewardene QC was a true leader of the Bar.
Dr. Jayewardene was a keen student of the law and a great teacher who was always willing to share his knowledge with fellow members of the profession.
The large number of lawyers who learnt the intricacies of the law in the chambers of Dr. H. W. Jayewardene QC include judges, politicians, senior practitioners, President's Counsel and several others.
The high calibre advocacy, meticulous chamber work and academic approach to any legal issue are some of the valuable lessons Dr. Jayewardene imparted to juniors under his wing. As a lawyer who started my career at his chambers we were well aware of the hard work put in by Dr. Jayewardene to his clients cause and in several cases without any payment, pro-deo, Dr. Jayewardene enjoyed working with his juniors in chambers and in courts and ensured that they were well equipped to be exemplary in the profession.
A true Buddhist
I am happy to note that Dr. Jayewardene's grant-daughter Shahila Wijewardena, a law graduate from England who completed her Attorneys in Sri Lanka and apprenticed in my chambers is now a busy practitioner in the chambers of Harsha Amarasekara PC following her grand-father's footsteps. Coincidentally Harsha Amarasekara PC and I were the last two juniors of Dr. H. W. Jayewardene QC Chambers.
The other contributions made by Dr. Jayewardene to the country were not limited to the legal field. He held several important posts in the public and private sector including Chairman of the Sri Lanka Foundation. He also led the team that participated in Thimpu talks in order to reconcile the burning issue of terrorism at that time. He was a perfectionist and his achievements are far too many to mention in an appreciation. A few years back the Bar Association of Sri Lanka named its main Auditorium in Hulftsdorph as the Dr. H. W. Jayewardene QC Auditorium, a fitting tribute for his services to the legal profession.
He was a true Buddhist who followed the precepts of the Buddha in his own quiet way. Dr. Jayewardene was a devoted husband and a wonderful father. It is said that writers leave behind their books and teachers leave behind their students. It is a fact that Dr. H. W. Jayewardene QC has been a large hearted man and a great guru to several in the legal profession.

Bruce McArthur: suspected serial killer charged in death of a Sri Lankan man
Police in Toronto have charged alleged serial killer Bruce McArthur with an eighth murder over the death of Sri Lankan man who had not been reported missing, the Guardian reported.
Hank Idsinga, a detective sergeant with Toronto police, said on Monday the 66-year-old landscaper has been charged with first-degree murder over the death of Kirushna Kumar Kanagaratnam. Idsinga said Kanagaratnams remains were found at a home McArthur used as storage for his landscaping business. The remains of seven others have also been found in large planters at the home.
Idsinga said Kanagaratnam, 37, arrived from Sri Lanka in 2010 and was not on file as missing. He lived in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough and had no direct family in Canada. Investigators said he was identified after they released photographs of the man and appealed to the public for help. He said identification was confirmed with the assistance of an international government agency.
Police said there are currently no known links between Kanagaratnam and the Gay Village of Toronto which other victims are known to have visited. The alleged victims fit a pattern: most were of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent and lived on the margins of Canadian society, their disappearances attracting little attention.Police say McArthur targeted men he encountered through dating apps that cater to gay men, meeting them at bars in the Gay Village. McArthur is accused of burying his victims remains in large flower planters on his clients properties. Police believe Kanagaratnam was killed between September 3 and December 14, 2015. Idsinga said he had some cousins who lived in the greater Toronto area.
Idsinga said more remains might be found at the home McArthur used as storage and that 75 properties linked to the landscaper are under investigation.
Police plan to search them once the weather warms in early May. We have a lot of searches still to do, he said.
Idsinga said investigators are looking into 15 other cold cases dating back to 1975, but have not found a connection.

The Chief Incumbent of the Gangarama Temple Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera said the Buddha Rashmi was initiated 12 ago on a concept of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and this is the third Vesak zone hold under the present government.
We have no competition with other Vesak zones in Colombo and have requested the Colombo Municipal Council to join all Vesak zones by decorating all the streets with Buddhist flags and lights, the Thera said.
Ven. Gnanissara Thera invited Sri Lankans of all religions to join Vesak Celebrations by lighting at least an oil lamp at their homes in order to make Sri Lanka a country free from internal and external conflicts. He stressed on the importance of involving people living in the North and East in the Vesak celebrations to bestow blessings of the Buddha. Buddhists cannot forget the Northern part of the Island which is a spiritually significant location for Buddhists. Arhat Sangamitta landed in an ancient port in Jaffna, Dambakola Patuna with a Bo sapling.
Ven. Gnanissara Thera pledged his support to exhibit the Sacred Relics of Buddha in the North to confer the blessings to the people living those areas. Prime Ministers Secretary Saman Ekanayake also spoke.

China's first quarter growth beats expectations at 6.8%
China's economy grew at an annual pace of 6.8% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, according to official data, beating forecasts for the period.
The growth figures for January to March were also above Beijing's 2018 annual growth target of around 6.5%.
The data shows resilience in the world's second largest economy, helped by strong consumer demand.
But concerns about China's economy - including rising debt levels - remain.
The government has been fighting to contain ballooning debt and a housing bubble without hurting growth.
Amy Zhuang, China economist at Nordea Bank in Singapore described the first quarter growth figures as solid but also said there are signs that the positive momentum is weakening, likely due to the cooling housing market.
The growth figures come amid concerns about China's outlook for exports which has been clouded by rising tensions with the US, its largest trading partner. Against this backdrop, Bo Zhuang, China economist at the research firm TS Lombard told the BBC that exports growth is the top growth risk in 2018. And while Mr Zhuang said stock markets have already priced in significant risks of a trade war, his firm believes it is feasible and likely that a deal can be negotiated.
As such, Chinese growth data through 2018 will be closely watched for any impact of tariffs proposed by the US. The first quarter GDP numbers are good figures, reflecting what appears to be a healthy economy in China, which continues to grow, albeit at a slowly decelerating rate.
But the prospect of a trade war with the US could stifle that. Strong retail sales growth of 10.1% suggests seasonal bounces are being ironed out and that the government's push to boost domestic demand is on track. Online retail sales growth continues to be vast; it was up just over 35%. At the current rate, this sector in China doubles in size every two to three years.
But it was also exports that helped the economy grow in line with the second half of last year. A resurgent global economy is very good news for China. But remember it's trying to wean itself off a reliance on exports leading the charge. This could be a particularly acute problem if the trade stand-off with the US escalates.
The caveat, as always with these numbers, is that China's GDP figures are pretty much unrivalled in their ability to match government targets and remain at a staggeringly consistent level. (BBC)

Strengthen their spine, not the schoolbag!
Not a single schoolchild is spared from the unnecessary burden of the schoolbag on their back. There is a simple solution to this problem as stated below. The textbook can be easily broken into three parts according to the syllabus of each term. Why carry the study material for the third term syllabus from January itself like a silly-bus
The mother who is fully in charge of the childs school matters, homework, arranging private tuition etc. is clever enough to work on this solution. She can break the textbook into three parts according to the syllabus of each term. The last page of each part can be photocopied and pasted making it a complete book for each term, with a homemade cover. When the time comes for reprinting, three books can be printed separately to coincide with the three terms. Smaller bag can be made with thick cotton material instead of thick canvass material used now.
The entire student population in the whole country will be benefited and parents and teachers too will, at last, find some consolation over this burning issue.
Then, the bulky exercise books can be replaced with smaller ones thus reducing the weight further. Yes, father has got to earn money which is a huge task and no time or peace of mind to attend to the child. A wise mother knows it well and thats why no objection to whatever he is doing!
All the school principals and parent-teacher associations are kindly invited to join hands in promoting this proposal to our dear minister for necessary action.

Colin Bland dies aged 80
LONDON, Monday: Colin Bland, a pioneer of fielding in an era when the skill was much less valued than it is in the modern game, died on Monday at the age of 80. He had been suffering from colon cancer.
Bland played 21 Tests for South Africa in the 1960s but in later life moved to London and worked for the MCC as a fielding consultant in 2004.
A formidable presence mainly at cover but also at mid-on, Bland was renowned for the accuracy and power of his throwing and athleticism.
Nicknamed the Golden Eagle, he raised the art of fielding and began a proud tradition of fine South African fielders that later included Jonty Rhodes and, most recently, AB De Villiers.
Bland would practice for hours throwing at one stump and was known for saving his team 20-30 runs in the field.
His most famous performance was in the Lords Test of 1965 when he ran out Jim Parks and Ken Barrington with direct hits, turning the match in his teams favour.
Ali Bacher, Blands South Africa team-mate, said: Fielding for us used to just consist of 15 minutes of catching and throwing, but Colin would spend hours and hours practising by himself, chasing a ball, picking it up, turning and throwing at the stumps. Wed watch him and would think he was from a different planet.

Dialog empowers next generation with coding and robotics
Dialog Axiata PLC, Sri Lankas premier connectivity provider, hosted a coding and robotics workshop for children of Dialog Club Vision customers at the Dialog Head Office Auditorium.
An initiative by the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM), in collaboration with Dialog, joined hands to carry out this novel initiative, a workshop on coding and robotics for kids.
The workshop not only allowed children to gain an understanding on basic IT skills at an early age, but also encouraged the next generation to take up IT as a profession in the future.
The workshop drew close to fifty children between the ages of 7-12, who experienced the thrill of developing games with simulations to learn coding and robotics skills with the support of Tec Sri Lanka.
The young aspiring coders were divided into several teams and given an opportunity to code a Star Wars game, in which winning teams were rewarded with Dialog Virtual Reality (VR) sets. Furthering their digital native skills, the teams were also exposed to programming of robots.
Supun Weerasinghe, Group Chief Executive, Dialog Axiata and Dr. Hans Wijayasuriya, Corporate Executive Vice President and Regional Chief Executive for South Asia, Axiata Group Berhad addressed the gathering and further re-iterated the importance of coding and Dialogs role in spearheading digital transformation amongst the next generation of makers and movers.
Sandra De Zoysa, Group Chief Customer Officer, Dialog Axiata PLC said, The workshop set aside a whole day to teach children on how to code and help them understand the basic mechanics of coding, with the goal of educating, enabling and ensuring children are equipped with tools and skills that will be essential for their education. Sri Lanka has a global reputation in best-in-class software development and through this initiative we hope to truly equip a generation that will experience the future, today.
We believe that it is important to expose children to coding as part of their early education so that they comprehend its vast potential and take a keen interest in technology right from their formative years, she added.
Dialog with the support of SLASSCOM and its member companies aim to empower and encourage young children to develop fundamentals in computer science through a series of workshops and simulations focused across science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), whilst educating children in an interdisciplinary and applied approach.
This initiative is the first of many workshops in Colombo and is set to roll out across the island to include key regions such as Kandy, Galle and Jaffna.

Dinosaur skeletons sell for over $3 Mn
FRANCE: Two dinosaur skeletons marketed as hip design objects -- one of a diplodocus, the other of an allosaurus -- sold for more than 1.4 million euros ($1.7 million) apiece at auction in Paris on Wednesday.
The same foreign buyer acquired the two dinosaurs, the Drouot auction house said, hailing exceptional prices for dinosaurs, though neither was a record.
The diplodocus -- a herbivorous giant measuring 12 metres long from nose to tail -- fetched 1.44 million euros, compared with 1.41 million for the carnivorous allosaurus, a minnow in dinosaur terms at just 3.8 metres (12.5 feet) long.
The two dinosaurs roamed the Earth during the late Jurassic period, around 150 million years ago.
Only about five dinosaur skeletons are put up for auction around the world every year, mostly snapped up by ultra-rich collectors or museums in Europe or the US.
But auctioneers have noted a surge in interest in China.
Dinosaurs have become cool, trendy -- real objects of decoration, like paintings, fossil sales expert Iacopo Briano told AFP ahead of the auction, citing Hollywood actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Nicolas Cage as fans of such outsize prehistoric ornaments.
The nationality of Wednesday's buyer was not revealed.
In 1997, McDonald's and Walt Disney were among donors stumping up $8.36 million to buy Sue -- the most complete and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex ever found -- for the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. - AFP

## Title: DISINTEGRATION OF VEDDA COMMUNITY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, April 18, 2018 - 01:00
DISINTEGRATION OF VEDDA COMMUNITY
Sri Lankas indigenous people, the Veddas fondly referred to as wanniya-latto are believed to have originated through Kuvenis twins. A community that thrived in the past, today, has had many of them blend in with the fast developing world and are gradually moving away from their traditional lifestyles.
However, although today the Vedda community is reduced to a few hundred, there is still a group left under its able leader Uuruwarige Wannila Ettho, who is keeping their ancient traditions alive. Like most indigenous cultures, the Veddas are facing the threat of extinction due to immigration, colonization and the advancement of the cultures.
Sri Lanka Army steps in
In support of the Vedda culture and community, present Army Commander Lt. Gen. Mahesh Senanayake is committed to rendering every support possible to keep this tribal community alive and preserving our tribal communities from total extinction. In this regard, a New Year celebration was organised on April 11, jointly by the Army, 'Wana Arana Foundation' and members of the indigenous community (Aadivasi) in the remote Hennanigala area.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, Commander of the Army, made time on his busy schedule to attend the 'Bakmaha Ulela', which was organized on the guidance given by the Chief of the indigenous community (Vedda Chief) Uuruwarige Wannila Ettho, who also attended the event as a distinguished guest. Major General Santhusitha Pananwala, Commander, Security Forces - East received the Commander of the Army and other invitees on arrival at the venue beside the Henanigala tank bund.
A multitude of very rare indigenous and traditional New Year games, quite unfamiliar to most Sri Lankans, were included in the celebrations while fun-making features dominated the full-day festival during which the 'Wana Arana Foundation' invited both the Commander of the Army and the Vedda Chief to launch their new 'Wana Arana Foundation' website. 'Wana Arana Foundation' is dedicated to preserve age-old indigenous traditions, rites and rituals, customs, habits, habitat practices, ancestral links and all related information to their heritage for the sake of future generations.
Adding surprises and novelty, the Chief Guest, Commander of the Army joined the indigenous people assuring them of all support on the same occasion and gave away some gift parcels to the Chief of the indigenous community and their fellow residents.
Indigenous knowledge an asset
The Army Commander, a member of the Special Forces himself, have had the privilege of occasionally meeting the Vedda people as their Special Forces training camp is also in that vicinity. It is also believed that they obtain certain advice from the Vedda community with regard to the jungle terrain during training sessions, as the Vedda community is quite familiar with these jungles.
In another appreciative gesture, the Commander gave a special gift to Thalawarige Punchi Banda of the Vedda community who secured the 53rd place in the recent Ironman 70.3 Colombo Competition, the first-ever triathlon in South Asia, held on February 25, 2018 at Galle Face with over 3,000 athletes, including 870 overseas participants from 63 countries.
The Commander openly appreciated the athletic skills of Punchi Banda and gave the undertaking that he would be recruited to the Army Volunteer Force and afforded best athletic training to reach higher levels.
The Army is an organisation that is committed to protect the country and its proud history and preserve its heritage and culture for the benefit of our future generations. If we are to achieve this task, we need to obtain the cooperation of all as it is a collective effort. Having met Punchi Banda previously, I have decided to recruit him into the army and further develop his skills in an attempt to give him the opportunity to take his talents and abilities, not just to Sri Lanka, but the world. He represents our indigenous culture and this is our humble attempt to render our support to him. We will support him in every possible manner, in physical and resource matter in order that he would be able to further develop his capabilities and bring glory to our country, Lt. Gen. Senanayake said.
The full-day festive atmosphere on the tank bund attracted a large gathering of Aadivasi community who came dressed in their traditional attire with their metal equipment, bows and arches.
The Vedda Community
Sri Lankas Vedda community used to inhabit the forest reserve around Ratnapura, and Mahiyangana before they were resettled in certain areas due to development projects. Currently, most Veddas can be encountered in Dambana, Mahiyanagana and Hennanigala. There are four types of Vedda clans currently in Sri Lanka. The most famous clan is known as Uru Warige, (the descendants of the boar). The current Vedda Chief is known as the Uruwarige Wannilaetto.
The Vedda Community have developed a language style unique to them. Although it is similar to Sinhalese, certain pronunciations and tones are quite different. Their language is solely for the purpose of conversation, and there does not seem to be a written language among them. Yet, the Vedda language is not as widely used today, and only parts of the language are used by the Veddas.
The Veddas are believed to be good hunters and their skills with the bow and arrow is known throughout the country. But unfortunately, these tribal communities are not able to put their bows and arrows to work as hunting in the forests of Sri Lanka is now banned. Therefore, the Veddas have now turned to Chena cultivation to grow their food requirements. The Vedda community once wore leaves as clothing but have also changed their attire with the countrys developments and except for certain functions and traditions, they now wear the sarong, but still keep their identity by having the axe placed on their shoulder as part of their attire.
Despite the changes in the country and all modern facilities, the Vedda community have held onto their traditions and values to a great extent. Their handshake is also a bit different to the usual handshake that we are used to.
However, the Vedda community is the last of Sri Lankas indigenous tribes and it is a challenge no doubt to protect them and their traditions in this fast changing culture. Yet, they are Sri Lankas last surviving tribal community and it is the duty of all Sri Lankans to help in protecting this ancient tribe.

Enter ketchup slices!
Tomato ketchup just got the make-over no one asked for. American company Bos Fine Foods has created a solid version of the perennially popular condiment which comes in individual packets.
They are perfect for carrying around with you, in case of a soggy burger emergency. Theres more good news. While the slices may look a little odd, they come with the bonus of being all-natural and preservative free.
So how did it come to exist
Bos Fine Foods co-founder Emily stumbled across the idea while working with one of her restaurateur fathers recipes for barbecue sauce.
The recipe required braising lots of vegetables but then throwing them away
Wanting to avoid that amount of waste, Emily then mixed them, ground them, and dried them out, with the accidental end-result being her slices.
Emily also decided to do away with the preservatives and high fructose corn syrup typically used in ketchup, instead using healthier ingredients.
The finished product is eight slices per packet - which dont need to be kept in the fridge.
Theyre now trying to raise money on Kickstarter , with the creators saying:
Bos Original Slice of Sauce is an individual slice of flavour-packed condiment offering a portable, convenient, clean label experience.

## Title: EQUALITY BEFORE LIBERTY
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, April 18, 2018 - 01:00
EQUALITY BEFORE LIBERTY
The concept of equality, so central to the discussion of justice lies at the root of the democratic idea. While the concept of equality has an ancient history, it is in modern times that equality assumes a significant role in the theory and practice of politics. Far back in history, Aristotle in his work  The Politics identified inequality as a cause of strife. Engels in his work  Anti  Duhring, considered the modern demand for equality something entirely different from the ancient idea that all men, as men have something in common and to the extent are also equal.. the modern idea consists rather in deducing from that equality of men as men a claim to equal political and social status for all human beings or at least for all citizens of a State or all members of a society.
In discussing equality and the need to achieve it, it is important to correctly identify the real causes of inequality. To Laski, no idea is more difficult in the whole realm of political science as the concept of equality. He emphasizes that equality does not mean identity of treatment. This is because there can be no identity of treatment as long as men are different in want and capacity and need. According to Laski equality means, first of all, the absence of priviledge and in the second place that adequate opportunities are laid open to all. He saw inequalities of wealth as a source of inequality. The attainment of freedom is impossible and political equality is never real unless accompanied by virtual economic equality. It is Marx and Engels who highlighted inequalities more than any other. According to them, inequality is the result of class divisions which are unjust but historically necessary. They are finally alterable in a classless society.
For Marxists, social equality implies abolition of private property, placing of all in equal relation to the means of production, equal opportunities for all to work according to their abilities and receive equal pay for equal work and equal opportunities for everyone to take part in decision making in state and public affairs. Marxists also stand for the elimination of the gap between rights and duties. Engles suggested that the phrase for equal rights for all be replaced by for equal rights and equal duties of all. Rawls saw two essential requirements in the notion of equality: (a). Each person has an equal right to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic liberties which is compatible with a similar scheme of liberties to all. (b). Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions. First, they must be attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity and second, they must be to the great benefit of the least advantaged members of society. For, economic equality has not been a popular slogan even among those whose hearts bleed for equality. Many who would stoutly defend with their dying breath the rights of liberty and equality: shrink back with horror from the notion of economic egalitarianism. Inequalities of wealth make equality of opportunity an empty slogan. Laski emphasized the provision of adequate opportunity to be one of the basic conditions of equality.
All the great revolutions aimed at shaking off arbitrary rule of one form or another, have stressed this concept of equality. Liberty, fraternity and equality were the watchwords of the French revolution. Many modern constitutions have enshrined this concept of equality; and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims, in Article 1, that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, echoing Article 1 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man 1789 that men are born and remain free and equal in rights. The right to equality extends to political power as well. As Engels emphasized: The equality of nations is just as essential as the equality of individuals. It is also impossible to consider human equality without assuring equality among languages and communities.
Social realities have demonstrated, however that the equality which the philosophers visualized is not always attainable in practice, however sweeping be the pronouncement on equality in the statute book.
Many of the discriminations that exist in society cannot be counted by law alone but need a deep change in social attitudes. No two people are equal in all respects. The inequalities of talent and other attributes resulting from nature are reinforced by social and economic circumstances, which place some at an advantage over others. Within these limitations, however, the attainment of equality is considered to be one of the time- honoured objectives of the law. Equality before the law is indeed one of the cardinal assumptions underlying the concept of the Rule of Law.
Tension between Equality and Liberty
The question arises however whether increased equality can only be achieved at the expense of liberty, or conversely, whether expanding liberty must diminish equality. Are the values of equality and liberty opposed or are they complementary Learned opinion is divided on the matter and it is important to be aware of the contentions on either side.
On the one hand it is clear that the ideal of equality cannot be promoted without a certain degree of liberty. Unless, for example, there is a measure of liberty, there is little change of economic equality in a society. If political power is in the hands of a tyrant or of a privileged class, that privileged class will perpetuate its privileges, and inequality will continue to be the order of the day. This was indeed the position in England after the Industrial Revolution, when inequality and economic exploitation reigned supreme. It was only after some degree of diffusion of power was attained with the Reform Bill of 1832 that a systematic attempt was made to end such inequality. The French Revolution is another classic example, for it needed the liberty achieved by the revolution to achieve equality.
Just as liberty generates equality, so equality generates liberty, for once the citizens of a state achieve a greater measure of economic equality they do not readily accept an inferior political position and kick against such restraints as are left. Rousseau made this point in The Social Contract, when he emphasized the dependence of liberty upon equality.
While these considerations are valid, there is another dimension to the problem. Lord Acton, one of the outstanding thinkers on the concept of freedom, emphasized that equality unrestrained could destroy freedom. We have examples of this in many revolutions, including the French, Russian and Chinese. Power is snatched from its traditional holders and then in the name of equality taken over by individuals or groups who claim to be the peoples representatives. Equality gradually achieved tends more often to be regulated and controlled than equality achieved in one burst as in a revolution.
Economic Liberty and Economic Equality
There is a second and even more important qualification, especially in the sphere of economic liberty, which has great relevance to modern conditions. Not infrequently there is a marked degree of tension between economic liberty and economic equality. For example, if one desires greater freedom of contract, there is correspondingly a restriction on equality, for such freedom facilitates vast concentrations of wealth and power.
Those possessing such wealth and power would then be so superior in bargaining power to others that there would be semblance of equality between them and the vast mass of citizens with whom they would do business. Conversely, if there is a restriction upon the freedom to contract freely, that restriction would be interpreted as a limitation of freedom.
Laissez- faire, the prevalent philosophy in the nineteenth century, led to enormous accumulations of wealth. In an age of expanding resources, undiscovered frontiers, and vast colonial territories awaiting annexation, such philosophies were not considered inappropriate. With earth resources shrinking, the last frontiers reached, colonialism dead, there is just not enough land or earth resources to permit of a continuing applicability of laissez-faire. There must be therefore restrictions and controls of various sorts. The individuals freedom to act as he pleases must be restricted in many ways. Freedom in the traditional sense is clipped but equality is strengthened.
There are arguments for and against unrestricted liberty. On a balance of all considerations the need is clear for limitations of some sort upon the restricted appropriation by a few of the earths resources which rightly belong to all. This cannot be achieved without controls. Equality necessarily spells out a restriction of freedom.
There are many aspects to this discussion. There is, for each nation, both a national and an international dimension to the problem. Nationally, the measures of control will need to be determined upon a fine balance of the principle of equality against the principle of freedom, to be worked out in the manner most appropriate to that societys needs and background. The particular mix that suits one country will not necessarily suit others. Each country will need to determine this for itself.

FAO fetes Lankas Cascaded Tank-Village System
For centuries, farmers, herders, fishers and forest people have sculpted our land to create agricultural systems of exceptional aesthetic beauty preserving biodiversity and creating resilient ecosystems and a valuable cultural heritage.
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) will celebrate these Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS), this year.
Fourteen new agricultural heritage sites from China, Egypt, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Spain and Sri Lanka will be designated during an award ceremony that will bring together high-level officials.
In 2017, the FAO designated a typical Sri Lankan agrarian system, the Illanga Gammana, or Cascaded Tank-Village System (CTVS) in the Dry Zone, for its inscription and recognition into the FAO List of GIAHS. The Cascaded Tank-Village System in Sri Lanka will be recognized at the International Forum and Award ceremony for new GIAHS sites on April 19, in Rome, Italy. All newly designated sites will be awarded certificates and country representatives will present their traditional agriculture systems. With the new sites, there will be a total of 50 globally recognised agricultural heritage systems in 20 countries. The participants will share their country experiences and representatives of international organizations, including the UNESCO World Heritage Center, will talk about the ecological, as well as touristic and economic value of these ancestral agricultural systems, during the Forum.

Sri Lanka 7s rugby perform disastrously at Gold Coast
Fundamental  errors cost us  dearly  coach  Peter Woods
Angry, disappointed, dejected, furious are just some of the words one can use to describe the performance of the Sri Lanka Sevens rugby team at the XXIst Commonwealth Games concluded at Gold Coast, Australia.
Sri Lanka made an early exit from the Games suffering three consecutive defeats. They were routed by the Fijians 63/5 in the opening match, thrashed 42/12 by Wales in the second game and finally humiliated 33/12 by Uganda in the final match.
Prior to the departure of the team some Sri Lankan rugby pundits talked big about how their side had prepared for the Games to gain glory for the country but in the end they could not win a single match and were placed a miserable 15th out of 16 teams in the competition.
Sri Lanka should thank the minnows of rugby Zambia for taking part for if not for them they would have ended up 16th and last.
The Commonwealth Games rugby debacle comes on the heels of the consecutive defeats the Sevens team suffered in the Borneo sevens last month.
Sri Lanka head coach New Zealander Peter Woods speaking to the media after Sri Lankas poor performance said Our guys are slipping tackles one on one, if we are going to do that against world class teams then they will punish you. Pace and size of our players is a huge difference. But its very frustrating to see them missing one on one tackles and basic tackles which we should have made.
No excuses for missing one on one tackles, especially in contact sports like rugby its very disappointing. Mainly against Uganda we lost because of fundamental errors. Where we need to perform better is we need to play more tournaments. We need to get a simple structure that we can develop more players and need to move forward. Its only simple steps. The gaps between the other international teams are huge. You can see with the results of other teams like Uganda and Papua New Guinea who played well with top teams. We first started playing only from March 1 this year whereas teams like Uganda have been playing tournaments from last November. We must keep improving on conditioning as well as work on basic skills and fundamentals of the game. We definitely have to work on basics to get better, Woods said.
I thought Sri Lanka played well against Fiji and Wales considering they are two of the top 10 teams in the world; especially Fiji being the No.1 rugby team in the world. They also had five guys over 63, said Sri Lanka Rugby CEO Priyantha Ekanayake.
However, I must say that I was a bit disappointed with our performance against Uganda. We did not really expect to win but we always felt that if we kept the scores close, anything could have happened in the last minute. Having said that if you look at Uganda, they had just played in the recently concluded Hong Kong 7s and participated in many 7s tournaments.
If you look back 10 years ago, we beat countries like Kenya and USA but now for us to beat a top team is just a dream. Most of the countries including the Asian countries are spending lots of money on the 7s and they have separate squads only for 7s. They are also playing tournaments right throughout the year. In our case we only get the players after the 15s and therefore to condition the players and get them accustomed to play 7s is a bit of a challenge, he said.
We need to give 7s more prominence like the 15s and have at least 6-7 local tournaments. We also need to give more exposure to our national teams if we are to beat top level sides. It is also important that we have Junior National squads U16, U18 and U20. This is something that we are looking at now, Ekanayake said.
Peter Woods coach -
In Sri Lankas first game against Olympic gold medalists Fijians which they lost 63 (9 tries, 9 conversions) to 5 (1 try) the solitary try was scored by former Peterite cum Kandy SC centre three quarter Danushka Ranjan in the first minute of the game going through the Fijian captain Jerry Tuwai
In their second game against Wales it was Ranjan who again opened the scoring with a superb try in the very first minute. Sri Lankas second try was scored by Srinath Sooriyabandara. Tharinda Ratwatte slotted in one conversion. Sri Lanka lost by 42 points (6 tries, 6 conversions) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion). In their third and last game Uganda it was Ranjan again who scored both tries for Sri Lanka with Ratwatte putting over one conversion. Sri Lanka lost by 33 points (5 tries, 4 conversions) to 12 (2 tries, 1 conversion).
New Zealand won the gold with a 14-nil win over Fiji with England taking the bronze with a 20-14 victory over South Africa.

Gates hails Lanka's high quality primary healthcare
The countrys primary healthcare system was held up as an example of what consistent dedication can achieve at this years CHOGM.
Microsoft Corporation Founder Bill Gates asked the Commonwealth to look to Sri Lanka to know what high quality primary healthcare meant.
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have developed very high quality primary healthcare systems staffed primarily by women healthcare workers, which model other countries are following, he said, speaking at the Joint Plenary Session on day two of CHOGM 2018 yesterday.
The business magnet and humanitarian who spoke on the theme of Towards a Common Future in London asked that the world adopt the best practices of all Commonwealth nations in order to revolutionise the way in which our current problems need to be solved.
He was joined at the session by British Prime Minister, Theresa May, Prime Minister of Jamaica, Andrew Holness and Commonwealth Secretary General, Patricia Scotland.
The Plenary Session brought together delegates from the Commonwealth Business, Peoples, Womens and Youth Forums and sharing insights, expertise and resources to work towards a common future had the Gates sound a positive note on the worlds problems.
Despite the news, the world is improving and if we invest in health, education, and economic opportunity, real improvement can be rapid, Gates said.
Taking on improving child mortality as a key statistic on the report card of humanity, he noted that the number of children living up to the age of five had greatly improved with three million children being saved every year.
The Commonwealth countries have driven much of this progress and are collectively responsible for over half the children saved over the past generation.
Sri Lanka which boasts of one of the lowest child mortality rate attributes this achievement to its extensive and comprehensive primary care system.
Gates who also took the opportunity to praise India for its efforts in eradicating Polio in 2014, explained how the Indian programme had motivated Nigeria to follow suit in 2017. In addition, island states in the Commonwealth helped the world take climate change seriously, he added.
Look at who is doing well and adopt from them, said business magnet turned humanitarian.

Heroic act of SLNG Lance Corporal saves four lives
The timely heroic act of a brave soldier of the 3 Sri Lanka National Guard (SLNG) of the Kawantissapura camp at Kataragama who fought at the risk of his own life miraculously saved the lives of four three-wheeler passengers, trapped in a raging inferno after the three-wheeler had a head-on-collision with a bus near the 'Aluth Para' junction on Colombo - Kataragama main road, close to Ambalantota on Monday (16).
Four members of one family, including one toddler and a child on their own three-wheeler were returning from Kataragama when a speeding passenger bus from the opposite direction collided head on, igniting a blazing fire in the three-wheeler while all the passengers remained trapped under the bus screaming for help.
Alert to the tragedy, Lance Corporal M.G. Chandana of 3 SLNG on board the Kataragama-bound bus, without giving any second thought to his own safety, started fighting against the blazing three-wheeler fire while simultaneously striving to rescue the children at first amidst outbursts of raging fire. He went on pleading for help from other passengers watching and finally managed to rescue both weeping children at first while his own shirt was affected with fire. Others on standby extended their support to the Army rescuer and brought water from all directions to douse the fire. They effectively managed to extinguish the fire and saved the lives of all four victims after pushing the bus to a side, although they were badly injured.
However, Lance Corporal Chandana with the assistance of his fellow-Army personnel who showed up, managed to send the injured to the Hambantota hospital. All four victims are out of danger and the Police are conducting investigations.
The Ambalantota Police station as well as the SLNG are planning to felicitate this heroic soldier for his timely intervention and the rescue of four lives, risking his own life.

Indias Kom rubbishes retirement talk,  dreams of Olympic gold
NEW DELHI, Tuesday - Indias best-ever boxer Mary Kom said Tuesday she has no plans to retire and is determined to defy her critics by winning an elusive Olympic gold.
Kom, 35, won gold on debut at the Commonwealth Games in Australia last week, complementing a trophy cabinet packed with five amateur world championship titles and an Olympic bronze from London 2012.
But Indias most accomplished pugilist, feted at home as Magnificent Mary, says the best is yet to come and has rubbished suggestions she could be close to hanging up the gloves.
I have never talked about retirement, they were just rumours. Even I was shocked when I heard about my retirement, Kom told reporters in New Delhi as Indias boxing team returned from the Gold Coast with three gold, three silver and three bronze medals.
An Olympic Gold is what I am still dreaming.
Kom was devastated to miss out on a wildcard entry for the Rio 2016 Olympics and said she was aiming for Olympic gold in Tokyo 2020.
The mother-of-three won a record fifth Asian womens championship title in November last year -- defying critics who suggested Kom was approaching retirement age.
Who said my age is a factor Come up and I will show what I can do, she said in jest when asked about boxing in her mid-thirties.
This (age issue) should be taken out of the mind. I will know when my body will not allow me to carry on.
The veteran fighter and subject of a blockbuster Bollywood film said she was preparing for the Asian Games, world championship and more and will try my best as she pursues gold in Tokyo.
Kom conceded she had a busy schedule -- as a professional athlete, parent, gym owner and lawmaker -- but warned her opponents against assuming she had too much on her plate.
I have taken this challenge to keep fighting at 35 or 36. No one can guarantee winning or losing, but when I train nobody can beat me easily, she said.  AFP

Indian economy  to grow 7.3%  - World Bank
Washington: The World Bank today forecast a growth rate of 7.3 per cent for India this year and 7.5 per cent for 2019 and 2020, and noted that the country's economy has recovered from the effects of demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax.
"Growth is expected to accelerate from 6.7 in 2017 to 7.3 per cent in 2018 and to subsequently stabilise supported by a sustained recovery in private investment and private consumption," the World Bank said in its twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus.
In its report the World Bank said, India should strive to accelerate investments and exports to take advantage of the recovery in global growth.
"Every month, the work force increases by 1.3 million people and India must create 8.1 million jobs a year to maintain its employment rate, which has been declining based on employment data analysed from 2005 to 2015, largely due to women leaving the job market," the bank said.
In the India section of the report, the bank acknowledged that disruptions from demonetisation and events surrounding the implementation of GST led to a setback in economic activity and a potentially larger negative effect on the poor and vulnerable.
Looking ahead, return to business as usual and subsequent rebalancing of growth drivers towards investment could support acceleration of GDP growth to 7.4 per cent by FY 2019, it said.
As in the past, sustained growth is expected to translate to continued poverty reduction, albeit with heightened uncertainty because of the effects on the informal economy, it said.
Noting that the one-time policy events disruptions from demonetisation and uncertainty surrounding GST slowed India's economic momentum in FY2016, the IMF said real GDP growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in FY2016, from 8 per cent in FY15/16, and further to 5.7 per cent in Q1 FY2017.

Indian police crack down on IPL betting racket
NEW DELHI: Indian police have arrested three men suspected of placing illegal bets on Indian Premier League matches as authorities crack down on gambling rackets that emerge around the billion-dollar franchise every year.
The trio were accused of running an online betting syndicate from a residence in New Delhi. Nearly all gambling is illegal in India but is still a huge underground industry.
We arrested the three on Saturday while they were betting during the Mumbai Indians and Delhi Daredevils match, Youdhbir Singh, a senior police officer in Delhi, told AFP on Tuesday.
They were insisting that they are first-timers and it was just a one-off incident, but we know that they were doing it since the start of the league on April 7. Eleven mobile phones, a laptop, a television set and a digital channel receiver were seized, Singh added.
Media reports say police have busted other syndicates, in the southern city of Hyderabad and the eastern state of West Bengal, in the first two weeks of the 11th season of the lucrative IPL franchise.
The money-spinning IPL, the worlds most popular domestic cricket league, has been plagued by controversy since its inception in 2008. Corruption and match-fixing have often taken centre-stage.
A spot-fixing scandal in 2013 led to the Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals being suspended in 2015 for two seasons.
Shanthakumaran Sreesanth, a Rajasthan Royals bowler, was banned for life along with team-mates Ankit Chavan and Ajit Chandila.
They were arrested along with scores of bookies as part of a probe into allegations that players had underperformed in return for cash from bookmakers. AFP

Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardene, yesterday, said the Joint Opposition will support the JVPs effort to completely abolish the Executive Presidency, by bringing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution.
Gunawardene, however, said this should include an additional clause that Parliament would be dissolved on the same day when the motion is passed.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo, Gunawardene said this proposal had the blessings of former President and Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa.
In fact, Gunawardene said, MP Rajapaksa had informed JVP leader and Parliamentarian Anura Kumara Dissanayake that the JO will support the motion to abolish the Executive Presidency if the JVP was willing to add an additional proposal to dissolve Parliament on the same day when the motion is passed.
The JVP recently said they have decided to present the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution as a Private Members Bill.
The JVP said the draft has already been prepared and attention has been drawn towards the time period that would be included in the Amendment, and the process that should be followed to get the Amendment passed in Parliament.

Lanka taking stern measures to deal with financial crime - Mangala
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday speaking at a roundtable discussion on financial regulation on the sidelines of CHOGM 2018 said Sri Lanka was taking stern steps to deal with financial crime.
The discussion on Financial Regulation: Working Together to Address De-Risking, held in London had the minister stress that as the dynamics of the finance industry and technology constantly evolve, it was essential that financial regulations remain one step ahead.
Financial crimes had various negative fall-outs in international finance and one such was de-risking, the scenario of global banks selectively withdrawing from the business of correspondent banking,Minister Samaraweera said.
This can have highly detrimental implications for banks in developing countries in particular as it can shut them out of the global financial architecture, he said.
Sri Lanka has long identified the risk of financial crime as a priority area, given the countrys history in battling a sophisticated terror organization. A number of measures were taken over the years such as the introduction of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act in 2006, Convention on the Suppression of Terrorist Financing Act in 2005, introduction of Financial Transaction Reporting Act in 2006 and setting up the Financial Intelligence Unit at the Central Bank, the Minister added.
Since November 2017, the Sri Lankan government has taken a number of measures to enhance Anti Money Laundering compliance such as introducing amendments to the Trust Ordinance, Companies Act, enactment of the Proceeds of Crimes Act, enhancing Customer Due Diligence Rules, and regulations on targeted financial sanctions on proliferation, the Minister said..
The challenge for countries like Sri Lanka is how to ensure continued progress of financial inclusion in this context, he said..
Minister Samaraweera further said one of the focuses of the government was to link grassroots entrepreneurs to finance and for that it was important for the Sri Lankan financial system to have robust access and engagement with the global financial architecture.
As the financial system develops, the laws and regulations aimed at preventing financial crimes need to be updated. Sri Lanka very well understands this reality and is taking every necessary measure to keep abreast of the regulatory developments, Minister Samaraweera said.

Lets hail our Commonwealth Games medallists
Sri Lanka has every reason to feel elated with their performances at the recently concluded XXIst Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia as our competitors brought home the highest medals tally in the history of the Games since 1938 when they first participated.
Although Sri Lanka did not win a single Gold medal they collected one Silver and five Bronze making it a tally of six medals overall which outstripped the four (1 Gold, 2 Silver, 1 Bronze) won at the 1950 Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand. On that occasion the Gold was won in athletics by Duncan White in the mens 440 yards hurdles, the 2 Silvers and 1 Bronze in boxing by K Edwin (Flyweight) and Albert Perera (Bantamweight) and Bronze by Alex Obeysekere (Welterweight).
Thus it is after 68 years that Sri Lanka has once again shone in boxing by winning three medals at Gold Coast. However on this occasion they have produced the first boxing medal won by a woman for Sri Lanka in the Games history when 38-year-old Anusha Kodituwakku took the Bronze in the 48kg category. She was unfortunate to meet Indias experienced woman boxer 35-year-old Mary Kom in the semi-finals which she lost unanimously on points.
Anusha, a former Sri Lanka womens rugby sevens player who is employed by MAS Holdings - a strong promoter of boxing, suffered a horrific injury when she broke her collarbone and suffered a fractured knee from a road accident during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, that almost ended her career as a sportsperson. However after a long layoff and rehabilitation Anusha fought her way back to make a miraculous recovery and comeback to win a Commonwealth Games medal for her country four years later at Gold Coast.
The other two Bronze medals in boxing were won in the mens category by former Vidyarthian southpaw Thiwanka Ranasinghe in the 49kg class and by Vidanalange Bandara in the 52kg class  both on their Commonwealth Games debut.
It was in Australia that Sri Lanka won their first Commonwealth Games medal when in Sydney in 1938 Barney Henricus, a sub inspector in the Ceylon Police Force (as it was then known) won the Gold in boxing fighting in the featherweight (57kg) class. Henricus defeated Scotsman James Watson in the final. Henricus served in the Police Force for 33 years before retiring as a Chief Inspector and migrating to the US in 1988 where he later passed away in California in 2007 at the age of 91.
For the next seven Commonwealth Games that Sri Lanka participated from 1954 to 1990 (they did not participate in 1954, 1974 and 1986) they had a barren run not winning a single medal. The drought was broken once more in Australia in Victoria in 1994 where Sri Lanka won one Gold and two Silvers  all in shooting. Pushpamali Ramanayake of the Sri Lanka Army and Malini Wickramasinghe did their country proud by winning Sri Lankas third gold medal in the Games history in the Womens Air Rifle Pairs. Malini also went onto bag Silver in the Womens Air Rifle event. The second Silver was won in the Mens Small Bore Rifle Prone Pairs by Dodangoda Chandrasiri and Lakshman Rajasinghe.
Sri Lanka followed this success at the next Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur in 1998 by winning their first medals in athletics with Silver and a Bronze. Sriyani Kulawansa won the womens 100 metres hurdles Silver and Sugath Tillakaratne the mens 400 metres Bronze.
Sri Lankas fourth and last Gold medal at the Commonwealth Games was won once again in Australia (Melbourne) in 2006 in weightlifting that was to play a prominent role in the countrys success for the next decade or so. Chinthana Vidanage, a product of Polonnaruwa Royal Central College covered himself with glory by winning his countrys only medal (Gold) at the 2006 Games in the mens 62kg category. Vidanage went onto win Silver in the mens 69kg class at the next Commonwealth Games held in Delhi in 2010 to join Malini Wickramasinghe and another weightlifter Sudesh Peiris as the only three Lankans to have won more than one Commonwealth Games medals. As overall captain of the 2018 Sri Lanka team to the XXIst Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast Vidanage made a valiant attempt to win a third medal but failed in the mens 77kg category.
Sudesh Peiris who hails from Kurunegala won a Bronze in the mens 62kg at Delhi, 2010 and improved on that performance at the next Games in Glasgow, Scotland four years later by winning the Silver in the same class as overall captain of his country.
At Gold Coast, Dinusha Gomes won Sri Lankas first Commonwealth Games medal at womens weightlifting with a Bronze in the 48kg class. Able Seaman Indika Dissanayake of the Sri Lanka Navy took the Silver in the mens 69kg category and Corporal Chaturanga Lakmal of the Sri Lanka Army the Bronze in the mens 56kg class.
Thus Sri Lankas overall medals tally at the Commonwealth Games is 20 (4 Golds, 8 Silvers, 8 Bronze) with Boxing and Weightlifting grabbing the lions share with seven apiece leaving Shooting and Athletics to share the remaining six.
As one would have gathered by the facts provided of the medal winners by now these are athletes who have come up the hard way from rural areas with basic facilities to bring glory to their homeland. They are the most deserving but the least recognized for their efforts because the sport they indulge in is not one of the more glamorous ones that catch the headlines often. It is their sheer determination to succeed and the hunger for recognition that has brought them to the forefront, more than anything else. Once they are out of the scene they are quickly forgotten and sometimes never seen or heard again. It is a sad reflection of our sports culture that we all live in.

Longest potato  cake launch
The longest potato cake was launched at Grand Hotel Nuwara Eliya on April 15. The Grands Pastry Master Chef Viraj and his team presented a 333-foot long potato cake, made with 500 yams, 600 eggs, 68 kilos of sugar and 30 kilos of margarine on April 15.
This delicious and succulent cake was ceremoniously cut by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while Kandy Mayor Chandana Lal Karunaratne, Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority Chairperson Kavan Ratnayake, Grand Hotel General Manager Refhan Razeen and other dignitaries graced the occasion.
Nuwara Eliyas love affair with potatoes began in 1850 when Samuel Baker and other British planters introduced their much-loved tuber in their tea and coffee plantations.
Originating from the Andes Highlands of Peru, this global favourite has since become synonymous with Nuwara Eliya simply because at an altitude of 6000 feet this region produces probably the best potatoes in the world.
With such an illustrious history and tradition behind it, the chefs at the Grand led by Chef Priyantha thought it fit to celebrate this versatile queen among vegetables, and host a potato festival from April 15 to 20 where more than 100 different potato preparations will be on offer at a reasonable price to all visitors to Nuwara Eliya.
The famous Grand Hotel road was the venue for the colourful, fun-filled one-of-a-kind event with street music, beverage stalls and many entertainment acts.

Lost in sculpture
All the dance aspects are well depicted in the solid static sculptural representations. The Indian sculptors produced excellent Hindu temple icons with a perfect theoretical foundation with well-established traditional codes and norms. The sculptors who produced the sculptures were very much impressed by the aesthetic essence of temple dances. The majority of the Indian dances are deeply rooted in Hinduism. Most of the Indian temple dances originated in Hindu temples.
The sculptors before they created their Hindu artefacts studied the Hindu Agama Sastra (established principles or codes of Hinduism) Silpa Sastra (defined traditional codes established by the theoretical concepts of sculptures) and Natya Sastra (Indian Aesthetic theory), well established theoretical traditions and principles related to dance and other dance-related art forms). Similarly, the Vasu Sastra deals with the science or Sastra of architecture. Silpa Sastra provides guidelines for forming or creating statues, icons and stone murals.
Different nuances
The beauty of the dance and its aesthetic essence attracted and influenced the minds of sculptors and painters. The dancing sculptures provided an aesthetic link between the dance and the sculpture by combined corporeality as a meeting point. The dance originated before sculptures. The dance poses influenced the minds of sculptors. Different nuances of dance including the stances (Ishana position), hand gestures and limb positions influenced the minds of sculptors. Further, these were the guiding and driving factors for the creation of devotional iconography and decorative architectural sculptures. Further, the sculptures are divided into two main categories. One is the Hindu temple icons and the other is the decorative sculptures
Plenty of bronze and stone sculptures were discovered from the Indu valley civilization. This is considered as one of the earliest forms of sculptures in the world. With the passage of time, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism produced excellent bronze sculptures to the world. Some of the sculptures of ancient India were carved on solid blocks. The sculptures were considered as some of the largest and beautiful sculptures of the world.
India had a history of sculptural tradition and it proves the excellent mastery of its iconography. Some of the dance sculptures discovered from the Indian sub-continent of Indu Valley civilization is excellent. One dance stone statute of Harappa is considered one of the oldest dance sculptures in the Hindu valley civilization. The period of the sculpture is estimated to be the period in between 3000 to 2000 BC. Similarly, another dance sculpture was discovered from Mohenjo-Daro (2000-1500 BC). Another torso sculpture of Harappa was identified by a famous scholar as the prototype of the dancing image of Lord Nataraja. Later the image served as a specimen dance image for the researchers to identify the affinity with the South Indian bronze sculptures.
One ancient Mohenja-Daro female dancing sculpture was depicted with proper tripanga dance posture with a well-defined appropriate dance hand gesture. Periodically different varieties of dance sculptures were recovered by archaeologists and researchers from numerous locations of the Indian sub-continent. In the Indian dance research study, the dance sculptures of South Indian temples occupy a pre-eminent position.
Iconography study
This dance research study could be approached from two different angles. One is based on the study of iconography pioneered by Ananda K Coomaraswamy and the other is on the research study of Karana dance sculptures of Hindu temples. Iconography does not mean an art form. It is a presentation of images which correspond to the ideas originally in the mind of the artist. Iconography dance images are especially in the form of sculptural representation. It is a reflection of the best or worst to any natural model. It is in imitation and imaginative creativity of angelic works of art (Silpa).
Dr Ananda K Coomaraswamy in 1912 made a valuable contribution to dance and sculptures. He also had done a dance research study with numerous other fine arts representations and the dances of Lord Siva. He investigated the divine manifestation of the deitys dance with the iconographical interpretation. Following Ananda K. Coomaraswamy some more researchers have also carried out a similar type of research on dance and sculptures and dance related sculptures. The research on frozen static temple based Karana sculptures of dance were further carried out by a few more outstanding scholars.
In the Indian sculptural research study, the period of the sculptures was divided into three different periods. They are the first period, second period and third period. A variety of ancient Lord Nataraja sculptures and different decorative Ganas (Goblins) sculptures were discovered from numerous locations of the Indian sub-continent during the first period. The majority of Lord Nataraja statutes belonged to the first period. The Gana sculptures (Goblins figures) were also found all over the ancient archaeological and ancient temple sites of India. Different postures of Ganas (Goblins) sculptures resemble typical dance rhythmic limb movements and body positions.
All the Gana sculptures of India were depicted with a rhythmic vibrancy of dance. According to some of the researchers, at the end of the second and third periods, very few images of Lord Nataraja were produced, but during these two periods, an ample variety of dancing sculptures were produced. Indian sculptures discovered from different areas belong to various ages. The documentary interpretations of dance and dance related studies are elaborately given in numerous texts especially in the Natya Sastra (Indian Aesthetic theory. The ancient sculptures of India propagate the dance with beautiful dance nuances through sculptural representation.

Malaysian Agro Chemical Company to enter SL
For the first time Malaysian Agro Chemical Company would be opening their first manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka next year.
CEO FertiChem Malaysia, S. Abbyan said that they are in to manufacture agro liquid fertilizer and they use 100% eco-friendly products. We manufacture this particulate liquid fertilizer using fruits and other material imported from Germany and its not harmful to humans. In fact you can even drink it! He said that their product can be used for tea, paddy, Palm oil, spices, fruit and vegetables, flowers and other agricultural crops and is being used in Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia and Cambodia.
Fertichem is a private international corporation which primarily manufactures & distributes fertilizers, agrochemicals and turf for agriculture and horticulture in various climates, weather and soil conditions. He said the success of the product has prompted them to look for other markets and they have identified Sri Lanka as their manufacturing base to venture to India, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal. The Port facilities from Sri Lanka are good and we have taken this too into consideration.
We have found a partner in Sri Lanka and set up Agro Solutions Asia (Pvt) limited for this purpose. We will invest around Rs. 350 million within the next nine months in Sri Lanka for setting up a plant, laboratory and for distribution.
He said that one of the main advantages of agro liquid fertilizer which will be marketed and distributed under the brand name, Mahana has no urea , is environmental friendly, increases yields by 35% and also brings down the fertilizer and labour costs by 60%.
He said that they did field visits to Paddy fields in Polonnarunwa, Ampara, Anuradhapura, and found out that a farmer spends around Rs 40, 000 for fertilizer per harvesting season per hectare. (SS)
A Paddy farmer for each harvesting season uses fertilizer minimum three times.
However with Mahana liquid fertilizer only three spraying cycles are needed and it will cost less than Rs 10, 000 per season for the farmer.
He also said that another unique feature is that after using Mahana the farmer will see an increase of yield by at least 30%.
This same result could be seen for other Agri products and this is also ideal to bring down the harvesting period of Pineapple by six months.
As a CSR initiative they will donate Rs. 20 from each one litre bottle to Sri Lanka National Kidney Fund.
He said once they set up their distribution network they will apply for BOI status to set up the factory in one of the BOI zones, said Chairman, Agro Solutions Asia (Pvt) limited, Thahir Mohamed Milhan.
He said that they have also obtained the import license and have also received Industrial Technology Institute of Sri Lanka approval to distribute these products.

Ravi Jayewardene:
Marksman who never took a life
Ravindra Vimal Jayewardene who led a life of austerity and simplicity, was asked why didnt he become a politician. Politics My father did not want me to. But he asked me to consider about it a long time ago. I told him that I was not concerned about politics at that moment, but would reflect upon it later. But I never considered about it and he never ever again. Not only his father, the first Executive President of the nation, but his uncles and ancestors were in politics.
Ravi, the only child of JR and Elina Jayewardene and the Air Lanka pilot was considered the best marksmen the country has ever produced. He once demonstrated his talents being asked how quickly can he pull the revolver and shoot. He had his gun out in a fraction of a second and said that he can shoot 12 people [dummies] in eight seconds.
Ravi who delivered a silent service was the chief architect of the elite STF, [Police Special Task Force] during father J Rs time. Unlike the progeny of other politicians, he did not abuse armed security or drive around for no particular reason other than enjoyment with black Defender escort. Ravi was a well-known nature photographer.
Sovereignty of Sri Lanka
In preserving the independence of the nation, though cited summarily in some write-ups, the gallant and brave task he undertook has not being acknowledged duly or recognized properly.
Concerned and worried about the bloodshed in border villages, Ravi voluntarily got involved in preserving the unitary nature of stateRavi joined hands with a grouping of patriotic people from the city who planned a course of action which they considered would reinforce the territorial integrity of the nation.
They built up a relationship with Buddhist nayake priests in the affected areas of border villages. Herman Gunaratna, who was an additional General Manager of Mahaweli Development, and Devinda Senanayake, a grandson of D. S. Senanayake, along with a few other senior officials of the Mahaweli Ministrywere the others who joined Ravi in settling over 45,000 Southern people to go and live with the Tamils in the Batticaloa district. He did it meticulously, causing no aggression; not a single Tamil family living in the district was troubled. Their main intention was to make all three communities - the Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim populations live in peace and harmony in these areas so that the longing for segregation and territorial degeneration is checked. It is to do away with the occurrence of constant hostility, carnage, suspicion and bloodshed.
Jungle craft taught to villagers
Military top brass under JR were confident; they assured victory over LTTE President trusted them. Son Ravi, however, was cast in a different mould.
He worked on a different agenda and went on to save the people; Ravi who at one time renounced the mundane world to enter the spiritual, commenced disciplining the mind and was on a assignment in Thailand with Thai meditation masters, but subsequently changed his thinking. July 1983 catastrophe made him re-think his future responsibilities. He contacted Devinda Senanayake whose grandfather, DS was responsible for setting up Padaviya settlement.
The group on their own decided to go ahead before the LTTE re-group as a fighting unit to attack the colonies and settlements. Ravi unofficially headed the informal group; when the proposal was made all concerned made their views, but left the final decision in the hands of Ravi himself. He wanted the message communicated to the villagers of Padaviya, that weapons and instructors are arriving.
He knew that the armed forces were not capable to defend the settlements of Sinhalese and Muslim and that the best alternative is that they must protect themselves from terrorism; which finally became the thinking of the entire group. Ravi wanted the instructors first put through a physical attack course, and given firing practice and brought up to battle level at STF headquarters; he undertook the full responsibility for the task agreeing to do it himself.
The unceremonious group maintained the strictest confidentiality about their procedures though there were no undisclosed secrets among themselves. Ravi saw the calamity from the viewpoint of the soldier; believed they, the terrorists can only be stopped by conquering them militarily. Our trained military men taught villagers the basic techniques of defence and jungle craft.
The government ministers were discussing how to arm and train the settlers, but they lacked the skill and intelligence on how this was to be put in to practice. Ravi ushered in a chapter in the war by re-assigning it from soldiers to the very people who became the target of the terrorists.
During the 1983 July pogrom, unprecedented communal clashes occurred when the marauding gangs took law unto their hands for four days. The father, President Jayewardene was shaken and became inactive. Police and forces that paraded streets encouraged the looters and hooligans. Ravi demanded the father to act immediately; he said the troops were just spectators while racist elements in his party were provoking the rioters. In fact, he understood that ethnic violence had no rational basis or reasoning.
The 14-seater helicopter landed in the jungles of East Buddhist priests had ordered a battalion of volunteers from the area. Later, the famous Dimbulagala priest, Seelaratna Thera joined the team that met Ravi who was an alert soldier by then. The commander of Padaviya camp was delighted, as he had anticipated this moment for two long years.
Ven. Dimbulagala thera requested Ravi to address the gathering, which he categorically refused saying I have only come to make every villager here a soldier, I am not a politician. The two head priests joined the team for the copter ride to a place near the Kent and Dollar farms, where the settlers from Maduru Oya were being rehabilitated. The commander there took them in jeeps to the terrorist-infested venue, an unsafe place deep into LTTE territory. Ravis and his two sons presence made everybody nervous and concerned. The Dimbulagala priest spoke to the people giving assurance that President JR Jayewardenes son and D. S. Senanayakes grandson had arrived there to rescue them.
Masses sans politics
Great-great-great grandson of Don Adrian Jayewardene, the Intelligent agent of both Dutch and British rulers and grandson of SC Judge EW, Ravindra Jayewardene represented the country in international games, even led the Sri Lankan team to the Tokyo Olympics in 1954. He passed away at the age of eighty exactly a year ago on April 2. The champion marksman Ravi once confessed, I have not killed a living being with a gun all my life.

The Education Ministry believes that the Grade One Admission process can be streamlined with the move and it will be helpful to do away with all forms of misconducts in the process.
Parents tend to produce fraudulent documents to gain Grade One admission and that procedure prevents the children closed to popular schools from admission to them.

## Title: New look Unity Government
## Supertitle:

New look Unity Government
In yesterday's editorial we welcomed the continuation of the unity government that was formed with much expectations and the decision by both the UNP and SLFP to stay the course despite a section of the Blues deciding to quit the government following the failed No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. We made the point that much of the promises made to the people during the elections remained unfulfilled and that it was obligatory for the unity government to make good its election pledges both on the economic front and also in bringing to book the crooks of the Rajapaksa government. We also stressed on the fact that the state apparatus was in a state of paralysis, and, that things hardly seem to be moving forward in almost all spheres.
It appears that saner counsel has prevailed and the President and Prime Minister apparently have decided to iron out their differences and work together for the rest of the duration of the Yahapalanaya Government.
According to our main story yesterday the SLFP and UNP will sign a new Memorandum of Understanding to work together in the government following ongoing talks. Speaking to this newspaper, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said the two ministerial groups presently engaged in discussions would come up with a common programme for the two parties to govern together for the remainder of the 18 months.
The new government will get off the ground with a ceremonial sitting in Parliament on May 8, he added.
Eighteen months is a long time away but the government cannot afford to dilly-dally. It should get cracking right away after the MoU is signed. It was this procrastination that led to the government having to pay a heavy price at the LG polls. Had it fast tracked development programmes, and, more importantly, the prosecution of the corrupt elements in the Rajapaksa government it would have gained the acceptance of the public which would have been reflected in the election results. It was the tug-of-war between the partners of the unity government that led to the current state of affairs and bred indecisiveness, leading to vital policies having to be shelved.
The new MoU that the two partners are slated to ink should therefore include firm clauses leaving no room for conflict. There should be no bickering at all cost and all actors in the government should speak with one voice. This would now be a distinct possibility with all the disruptive and divisive elements exiting the government. It was very clear that the likes of Susil Premajayantha and Dayasiri Jayasekera were advancing the agenda of the Joint Opposition and batted for the JO right along while enjoying the perks and privileges of ministerial office.
This was made all the more apparent with Jayasekera putting JO firebrand Mahindananda Aluthgamage in the clear in the case where the latter had allegedly used public funds to the tune of Rs. 39 million to purchase sports equipment for distribution, during the Presidential election. A vernacular newspaper supportive of the Rajapaksas quoted Jayasekera as having said that he was dead certain that Aluthgamage had nothing to do with the transaction.
This was an ongoing case having its origins at the very inception of the Yahapalanaya government in which Jayasekera was well ensconced as a minister (lately as co-Cabinet Spokesman). Jayasekera owes an explanation to the public as to why he remained silent in all that time and is proclaiming the innocence of his colleague from the JO only now.
Thus, with the coast now clear the unity government should move fast in providing the much needed relief to the public whose anger was expressed in no uncertain terms on February 10. Particular attention should be paid to the plight of the farmers, and the peasantry. With an impending increase in the price of diesel the deep sea fishermen will be badly hit and measures should be taken to issue them subsidized fuel. The public too will have to bear the brunt of the fuel price increase which is going to have a knock down effect on almost all consumer goods. Difficult times, no doubt, are looming and it will take an exceptional effort by the new look unity government to see through the next 18 months.
A mischievous act
Sri Lanka's returning Commonwealth Games medalists must have been surprised to find them being garlanded at the BIA by none other than a former Sports Minister in the Rajapaksa Government, C.B. Ratnayake. While no one can find fault with whomsoever doing the honours, in the absence of a reception party from the government, this clearly smacked of an attempt to belittle and humiliate the authorities. Worse, among those present to receive the medalists was a personage against whom there is a pending case for embezzlement of public funds.
It is not clear as to why stopgap Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha was not present. But an inquiry is called for to ascertain if this was a deliberate act to embarrass the government and if there was connivance by officials at the BIA, working to a political agenda.

No licenses to operate schemes involving virtual currencies - CBSL
The term virtual currencies is commonly used to refer to digitally created representations of value that are issued by private developers and denominated in their own unit of account.
Common examples of virtual currencies are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum. Virtual currencies are not central bank issued currency.
Virtual currencies such as cryptocurrencies use decentralised peer-to-peer digital networks to authorize transactions. Due to the absence of a centralized authority such as a Central Bank to guarantee the value of the currency and regulate transactions, there is no recourse in the event of any user or transaction related issues or disputes.
The value of virtual currencies is dependent on speculation and is not backed by an underlying asset or a regulatory framework. Due to this, virtual currencies may demonstrate major volatility.
Similarly, there appears to be a high probability of virtual currencies being used in illegal activities. Further, though unintentional, their usage could amount to breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws.
Therefore, cryptocurrencies, in the present form, may pose significant risks in terms of financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks to their users as well as to the economy.
It is hereby notified to the public that CBSL has not given licence or authorization to any entity or company to operate schemes involving virtual currencies, including cryptocurrencies, and has not authorized any Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs).

North Central Province identifies  importance of Applied Statistics
Based on a request from the Provincial Planning and Monitoring Department in the North Central Province (NCP) a four-day workshop designed by the Institute of Applied Statistics Sri Lanka (IASSL) was conducted for 30 officers of diverse fields from NCP.
This was to identify the weaknesses, problems, crises, and opportunities that a province can achieve in the area of sustainable development through the use of statistics.
The course was conducted at the Computer Laboratory, Department of Rural Development and the two resources persons were Professor in Applied Statistics University of Moratuwa and Chairman, Academic and Training Committee, IASSL Prof. T S G Peiris, and Professor in Applied Statistics, Wayamba University of Sri Lanka Prof. N R Abeynayake. Participants were also awarded certificates by the IASSL.
Provincial Planning and Monitoring Department in the North Central Province has identified the necessity to develop a group of public sector officers who have individual or common vision for searching social, economic, environmental, ethnical, or development problems, or crisis within the province and finding facts and solutions for them to help the sustainable development in NCP.
Prof. Peiris has an opinion that due recognition is not given to the applied statisticians in Sri Lanka although all government and private organization use statistics for their planning. He further emphasised that most government department collect large amount of data mainly through surveys and spend a lot of money and resources, but the full benefits of such data is not obtained mainly due to lack of skilled applied statisticians. Thus Prof. Peiris urge that such service can be obtained from the IASSL.
The participants had a hand on experience in analysing real survey data using SPSS, interpretation of results and report writing.
Although the use of social survey and analysis of such data is a very successful process, it is very little use of them to solve such problems in the public sector.
Based on the feedback from the participants, IASSL is now trying to organize similar workshops for the Executive Staff in Provincial Planning and Monitoring Departments in all other Provincial Councils.
IASSL has been conducting various workshop in different areas in statistics for researchers, medical doctors, planners, and post graduates students.
IASSL has been incorporated by the Parliament of Sri Lanka on 20th September 2011 under the Act No. 38 of 2011. The IASSL is the only professional body for Statistics in Sri Lanka and one of their main function is to train the government and private officers to use statistical data analysis for decision process.

Notts beat Lancashire as  12 wickets fall before lunch
LONDON, Monday: Nottinghamshire began life back in English County Championship Division One with a six-wicket win at Lancashire after an incredible finish.
Having resumed on 58-2, the hosts were all out for just 73 after losing eight wickets for 15 runs, as England paceman Jake Ball (4-14) and left-armer Harry Gurney (6-25) ran riot at Old Trafford. That left Notts needing 10 runs to win, but they then slumped to 9-4.
Australian seamer Joe Mennie took three wickets, before Riki Wessels scored the single needed for victory.
Only three of Lancashire's batsmen reached double figures, as they became the third county after Kent and Northants to be bowled out for less than 75 in the opening round of County Championship fixtures.
Mennie's burst to leave Notts 5-3 was no more than a blip before Steven Mullaney's side took 20 points back to Trent Bridge.
Hampshire's fast bowlers condemned newly promoted Division Two champions Worcestershire to a heavy 196-run County Championship defeat on the final morning at Southampton.
Resuming on 59-3, needing a further 265 to win, the visitors were blown away. Former West Indies fast bowler Fidel Edwards took 3-33, including two in two balls, in a whirlwind spell.
Gareth Berg, Brad Wheal, Liam Dawson and Kyle Abbott (4-45) took a wicket each as Worcs were out for 127.
Having taken the three wickets to fall the evening before, Worcestershire old boy Abbott finished with match figures of 7-90.
Gloucestershire scored the 47 runs needed to beat Kent by five wickets, despite a mini-collapse at Canterbury.
Resuming day four on 61-1 with a target of 108, the visitors lost three wickets in eight balls to leave them 84-4. But Benny Howell's 52 not out saw them to 108-5 and victory before lunch - with Kent's Matt Henry claiming 3-37.
Kent never recovered from being bowled out for 64 on Saturday after day one was washed out, as the pace bowlers dominated throughout.
Middlesex laid down a marker in Division Two with a 160-run win over Northamptonshire at Lord's.
The 2016 county champions were relegated last season, but sealed a convincing victory thanks to their seamers bowling out Northants cheaply for the second time in the match.
Chasing 303 to win, Northants collapsed from 9-0 at the start of day three to 142 all out, with James Harris and Tim Murtagh both taking four wickets. Harris claimed match figures of 9-48. The 27-year-old also made the highest score of the game with his unbeaten 46 in Middlesex's first innings. After 26 wickets fell on Saturday, batting conditions continued to prove tricky as only three Northants batsmen reached double figures and Middlesex wrapped up victory just after lunch.
Sussex's South African all-rounder David Wiese made the first County Championship century of the summer. But that was the only final-day high spot at Edgbaston as Warwickshire's rain-ruined home game with Sussex petered out into a draw.
Yorkshire and Essex's County Championship match at Headingley was abandoned as a draw without a single ball bowled because of a wet outfield.
Umpires Ian Gould and Richard Illingworth called off day four shortly after a second inspection at 10:00 am.
English county scores on Monday:

A suspect in possession of 2 grams and 500 milligrams of heroin was arrested by officers of the Western Province Anti-Corruption Unit on Monday. The arrest was made at Seevali Lane, Colombo 8.
The suspect is a 69-year-old resident of Borella and was scheduled to be produced before the Maligakanda magistrate court yesterday.
Three arrested in fake note racket

EPRLF leader and former Parliamentarian Suresh Premachandran said that his party has decided to support Northern Chief Minister C.V.Vigneshwaran in forming a new political party.
The EPRLF leader made this statement in connection with C.V. Vigneshwarans media statement that the people in the North requested him to form a new political party to contest for the Chief Ministerial position again provided that the TNA would not nominate him for the next election.
C.V.Vigneshwaran said that he was considering joining another party of which the policies tally with his and not to form a new party.

PUCSL, CEB AT LOGGERHEADS OVER long term power generation plan
The tug-o-war between the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) over the long term power generation plan has reached new heights with both parties refusing to budge an inch.
Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) President Saumya Kumarawadu told the Daily News that they would start a work to rule and non-cooperation with the PUCSL from Friday as yesterdays meeting between the CEBEU and Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya ended leaving matters open.
The union announced that they would only work strictly during the office working hours from 8.30am to 4.15pm and that their members would not be on on call duty to attend to any urgent breakdown of power. They will also not sit on the meetings of Technical Evaluation Committees, tender boards, joint working groups, project groups and special assignments.
The union said it also launching an action of non cooperation with PUCSL until key staff members of the commission are replaced with experienced and honest professionals.
The main contention between the CEB and PUCSL is over inclusion of coal in the Least Cost Long-Term Generation Expansion Plan-2018-2037 prepared by the CEB. The PUCSL amended the plan to omit coal power and instead increased the LNG and renewable power share in the proposed energy mix before giving it green light in June last year.
However, the CEB did not accept the amended plan and sought Cabinet approval to go ahead with its original plan which included 500 MW of coal power. The Cabinet paper submitted by the ministry was referred to PUCSL for comments and the latter rejected it once again.
According to a report compiled by the PUCSL, the delay in implementing the long term power generation plan had caused Rs 50.8 billion loss as at November 2017 and since then has been incurring Rs.3.43 billion in losses per month.

Addressing a press conference in Jaffna, Sampanthan said that the Joint Opposition might move a no confidence motion against him, accusing him for voting in favour of the no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. It is neither ethical nor the parliamentary tradition to bring a no confidence motion against an opposition leader. I think that nowhere in the world has an opposition leader faced a no confidence motion, he said. He further said that if a no confidence motion is brought against him, he was ready to face it.
If the joint opposition brings a no-confidence motion against me for supporting the Prime Minister, I am ready to face it, he said. He noted that the national government led by the President and the Prime Minister now should focus on swift constitutional reforms.

Roar gains recognition  in Bangladesh
Sri Lanka-based digital content platform Roar has taken the top spot in its sector in Bangladesh, having become the No. 1 New Media platform in that country.
In India, despite it being a virtually untapped market for the platform, Roar has already shown encouraging growth. Considering India's current overall internet penetration is just 33 per cent, and that it is the second largest online market in the world, with digital ad spends of $2 billion for 2018, there is immense potential for growth for Roar, with it set to become one of the top digital content players in India within 2018.
Roar has additionally become a dominant player in Sri Lanka, addressing topics from tech to travel to social issues in Sinhalese, Tamil and English.
Helping its various initiatives along is the recent completion of Roar's Pre Series A round of venture capital funding, which was led by the Digital Innovation Fund, powered by Dialog Axiata, and managed by BOV Capital.
The Digital Innovation Fund is pleased to support fast growing digital content provider Roar in its South Asian expansion. Following Dialog Axiatas initial investment in the Fund, we are looking to finance and mentor high growth potential digital startups with a particular focus on new technologies like Fin Tech, Health Tech, e-commerce, Edutainment, IoT and Media/Ad Tech. In addition, we also continue to welcome interest from potential investors for this very important Fund, which will empower the Sri Lankan startup ecosystem to continue to grow and thrive, commented BOV Capital Co-FounderPrajeeth Balasubramaniam.
With plans to become the premier digital content organisation in South Asia,Roar has utilized good infotainment-led content in regional languages to dominate across markets.
At the same time, Roar expects the majority of its growth to come from localized language content, with a particular focus on video.
Besides the groups already served, Roar has plans to target many more language speakers in India who typically do not have access to good quality content.
Today, by publishing digital content across eight different websites, Roar receives over 35 million monthly video views, with a 20% month-on-month growth rate, along with more than six million website visitors, which increases 15% month-on-month.
Commenting on Roars recent string of successes, its CEO Mustafa Kassim said, We have grown immensely across the South Asian continent over the last 24 months, and now, with backing from Dialog Axiata and BOV Capital, we can accelerate this growth even further. We can leverage these networks across South Asia to help us reach many more users and drive sales to the next level.

Rooted  in emotions
The two collections of varying types of narratives written by Jhumpa Lahiri, namely Interpreter of Maladies (first published in India and later in the USA) and the Unaccustomed Earth take me as a reader to a world of pathos and excitement that makes a moment of palpitations culminating in a vision beyond mere storytelling.
Out of the two narratives, I began reading the Interpreter that contains nine long stories that encompass the lives of many an Indians settled either in the UK or the USA. Jhumpa Lahiri who was born in London to Bengali parents was raised in Rhode Island, USA. She narrates episodes from the lives of Indians in exile. Some returning to the native soil from time to time, sometimes featured as alien perhaps uprooted and in search of their roots. One fascinating experience unfolds in the narrative titled as Interpreter of Maladies in the collection of the same title.
Sandwiched cultures
Here the same reader encounters the delicate experiences of Mr and Mrs Das who visit India with their children grown up in the US. Though the children are depicted as alien, seeing monkey roaming around, the parents are sandwiched between two cultures. They are on their way to see the Sun Temple at Konark. They are taken to see the place by one driver cum guide named Mr Kapasi.
It is more or less the dialogue between Mrs Das and Mr Kapasi that matters. Mr Kapasi seems to reveal his other profession such as working with a medical doctor. He reveals the fact that he is an interpreter. Mrs Das wants to know more and more about this profession instead of enjoying her visit. This paved the way to reveal whether it is fact or fiction these innermost feelings of both of them. A reader may find that the inner layer in the fairly long narrative makes a palpitating effect rather than a track-ending storyline.
The narrative encourages the reader to know which one desired rather than what is forcefully suppressed by restraint. In this same collection, the opening narrative titled A Temporary Matter revolves around a newly married Indian couple who live presumably in a foreign strand facing day to day encumbrances while the wife is expecting a child. It is the episodic narrative of Shaba and Shukumar. A notice reached them to know that for five days their electricity would be cut off for one hour, beginning at 8 pm. A line had gone down in the last snowstorm and the repairmen were going to take advantage of the milder evenings to set it right.
Inner feelings
The work would affect only the houses on the quiet tree-lined street, within walking distance of a row of brick-faced stores and a trolley shop, where Shoba and Shukumar had lived for three years. The narrative of Lahiri revolves around the issues faced by them in order to make their lives happy and content. They at times engage in seated discussions or trying to devise a game of revealing their inner feelings to each other. They engage in cooking, drinking and flashing back to their own lives. They too are like the characters in most other stories. They are either uprooted or disturbed. The culmination and the high point in the narrative are that Shoba gives birth to a dead child about whom they take the least.
Moving on to the other collection of Lahiris narratives, I found the title story, Unaccustomed Earth, as one of the most sensitive, enlightening and humane narratives that had been gifted to the world of English readers around the world. The narrative rests on the life of a young Indian woman, Ruma, living with her husband who moves from place to place as his profession demands. Ruma is visited by her father who teaches various types of activities to her little son. The link that exists between the grandfather and the grandson develops into a world of vision that cannot be explained in the definition and/or concepts. This could only be perceived as a testament of emotional wisdom.
On reading the narrative, I constantly remembered the dictum of Mark: wherever the man goes, he is bound by chains. In the narrative, the protagonist, Ruma, is featured as a woman bound by chains. One sensitive factor is laid in the following words:
In New York, after Akash [her son] was born, she had negotiated a part-time schedule at her law firm, spending Thursdays and Fridays at home in Park Slope and this had seemed like the perfect balance. The firm had been tolerant at first, but it had not been so easy, dealing with her mothers death, just as an important case was about to go to trial. She [mother] had died on the operating table of heart failure. Ruma faces the bereavement but tries to overcome.
In this narrative, the side of her father too is brought to the forefront as a person who lives alone. But Ruma and her father who lives miles away talk on the phone. This temporary relief is eased off more when the father arrives to share the living conditions of Ruma and her son. I felt that Lahiri never attempts to sentimentalise or create overemotional situations in her narratives. Instead, she creates lasting simple episodes of living conditions, where the inner layer is much more important than the outer layer. As such, these narratives in the two collections are good examples of a creative process, possessive of a sensitive expression of human experiences.

Facebook said that it was hiring more Sinhala speakers to monitor hate speech on its platform, responding to an open letter from Sri Lankan civil society groups.
In an April 11 email to the Centre for Policy Alternatives, Public Policy Director for India and South Asia, Shivnath Thukral said the company was taking concrete steps to address misuse of our platform in Sri Lanka.
There is no place on Facebook for hate speech, incitement to violence, and other content that violates our Community Standards, he wrote.
The Centre for Policy Alternatives and 12 other civil society groups published an open letter to the company last week, highlighting posts that advocated violence against Muslims posted earlier.
They alleged that many of these posts stayed online for days, or were judged not in violation of Facebooks standards.
The companys rules prohibit any written attacks on people based on their Race, Ethnicity, National origin, (or) Religious affiliation.
In response, we are increasing the number of Sinhala-speaking content reviewers on our Community Operations team to provide around-the-clock coverage, Thukral said. (We) will continue to engage with a diverse group of stakeholders, including the Sri Lankan government and civil society organizations like yours, to curb hate speech and deepen our understanding of local context, he added.

Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in a bid to popularize womens cricket in the country has decided to support the big matches of 30 identified Girls Schools during the year 2018.
SLC will provide a grant of Rs. 100,000 for each game and in addition will also provide cricketing equipment for Girls Schools taking part in the big matches and pay the fees of the Umpires and Scorers covering the respective big matches.
The latest move, which is being done with the guidance of SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala is part of SLCs vision to develop womens cricket in the country by attracting more girls to play the game, which in turn will open them the doors for the national womens team. This is the second time; SLC is supporting girls school Big Matches, with the first being done during last year.
During this year, 10 more girl schools will join the big match fray thus, making it a total of 30 from last years figure. Schools from the districts of Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Jaffna, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, Ampara, Kandy, Moneragala, Ampara, Badulla, Matara and Anuradhapura will play Big Matches during this year.
SLC will also provide its international venues such as Pallekele and R. Premadasa Stadium to work out the matches.
The matches will be a 50-over affair for each side and will be played either in tape ball, leather ball or tennis ball.
Already the Big Matches of Panadura Mahanama Girls School vs Wadduwa Central College and Gamini Central College vs Our Ladies College of Nuwara Eliya was held recently with the support of the SLC.

SLTDA closes Mirissa surf bar, full probe on tourist attack
The Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority has ordered the closure of the surf bar and restaurant in Mirissa where a group of Dutch tourists were assaulted, until the investigations are completed, a SLTDA official told the Daily News.
Following the arrest of six persons suspected of the sexual and physical assault on a group of tourists in Mirissa on April 8, action has been taken by the police to conduct an identification parade by bringing down two of the victims who have left the country, while all their travel expenses will be borne by the Tourism Ministry. This was revealed at a press conference convened at the Tourism Ministry yesterday. Police Spokesman SP Gunasekara said in light of this incident, a block of land had been acquired to set up a tourist police post in Mirissa.
The SLTDA states that it has written to the Excise Commissioner requesting him to raid the establishment where the incident took place and find out how liquor was being sold when no licence had been issued for that purpose. SLTDA has also launched a separate investigation into the operation of the establishment.
Four suspects were arrested and remanded by the Weligama Police on Friday April 13 and two others on the 15th following the recording of statements from several witnesses. The area OIC had also been transferred while investigations are progressing and more arrests will be made.
The Tourist Police is actively involved in the investigation and is assisting the Weligama Police by facilitating contact with the victims, some of whom have left the island. Meanwhile the Ministry of Tourism Development had also summoned a meeting with key police officials in order to strengthen security in tourist hot spots and introduce safeguards to prevent such incidents.
The Tourism Minister called on the police to strengthen its Tourist Police Division as soon as possible and to set up permanent posts at all tourist hot spots. In the interim he also requested to consider deploying the STF in troublesome areas such as Mirissa.

Sri Lankas growth to rebound in 2018 - World Bank
Sri Lankas economic outlook remains favorable provided the government is committed to the reform agenda of improving competitiveness, governance and public financial management says the World Bank in their outlook.
Economic growth is projected to be around 4.5 in 2018 from 3.1 (estimated) in 2017 and will continue to be around 4.5% in the medium term, driven by private consumption and investment.
Inflation will stabilize at mid- single digit level as the impact of natural disasters wears off, although the upward trend in oil prices may exert some upward pressure. The external sector will continue to benefit from the GSP+ preferential access to the European Union and tourism receipts, despite the deceleration of remittances. External buffers are expected to improve, with emphasis on purchasing foreign exchange, maintaining a more market-determined exchange rate, and increased FDI, the report said.
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to fall in the medium term, supported by the ongoing implementation of revenue measures. Growth should continue to translate into poverty reduction and improvement in living standards. A complex political environment and the impact of natural disasters, such as floods in May and prolonged drought across the country, made 2017 a challenging year for Sri Lanka. As a result, Sri Lankas macroeconomic performance slowed down.
However, a primary surplus was recorded for the first time in decades. Hence, even though the overall deficit has slightly increased due to a sharp increase in interest expenditure, public debt to GDP ratio has marginally decreased due to primary surplus and relatively low currency depreciation.
With the support of World Bank, the government is carrying out fiscal reforms, improving public financial management, increasing public and private investments, addressing infrastructure constraints and improving competitiveness. The launch of its Vision 2025 on September 4, 2017 was designed to strengthen democracy and reconciliation, inclusive and equitable growth and ensure good governance.
Nonetheless, despite government commitment, the progress of reforms to enhance competitiveness, promote good governance and continued fiscal consolidation, have already been slowed by the effects of political uncertainty. Since these reforms are critical for sustained growth, and the key risks remain, a favorable outlook is uncertain.
Since the civil war ended in 2009, the economy has grown on average at a rate of 5.8% a year, reflecting a peace dividend and a commitment to reconstruction and growth.
The country has made significant progress in its socio-economic and human development indicators. Social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia and compare favorably with those in middle-income countries. Economic growth has translated into shared prosperity with the national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3% in 2006/07 to 4.1% in 2016. The report also stressed on addressing issues such as competitiveness and taking measures to increase trade. Sri Lanka also attracts a much lower volume of FDI than peer economies and the shortcomings of the investment climate pose obstacles for new firms. Moreover, significantly high state participation in the economy has implications on competitiveness in a number of sectors and labor market dynamics, the report said.
Low revenues as a share of GDP have been a structural issue that adversely impacts fiscal position. The major causes are the low number of number of tax payers (less than 7% of the labor force and formal establishments pay income tax), reductions in statutory rates without commensurate efforts to expand the tax base, inefficiencies in administration and numerous exemptions. Sri Lankas improvement in its macroeconomic performance was masked by inclement weather in 2017. Fiscal and monetary policy measures contributed to stabilization. However, the adverse economic impact of a prolonged drought took a toll on growth (3.1%) and the external sector while raising inflation (6.6%, annual average). 
The report further said Sri Lankas economic challenges should be addressed through macro and structural reforms: (1) stay on the fiscal consolidation path by broadening and simplifying the tax base and aligning spending with priorities: this is important given high public debt, SOE debt and guarantees; and large gross financing requirements; (2) shift towards a private investment-tradable sector-led growth model by improving trade, investment, innovation and the business environment; (3) improve governance and accountability by implementing the Right to Information Act and improve SOE performance and service delivery; and (4) reduce vulnerability and risks in the economy by enhancing disaster preparedness and mitigating the impact of reforms on the poor and vulnerable with well-targeted spending.

Sri Lanka Tourism targets US$ 4.5 bn revenue for 2018
Sri Lanka Tourism will target a revenue of US$ 4.4 billion, said Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunge. Sri Lanka ended 2017 with US$ 3.9 billion revenue.
He said that the industry for this year has already shown a growth of 24% and will move from the current third position to be the top foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka soon. The Minister also said that they have taken quick steps against harassment and physical assault of tourists in Mirrisa recently by locals in the area.
The incident which caused outrage in the tourism industry was made known only through the media as neither the victims nor the establishment concerned or any other person had reported the matter to the police or any other authority. Investigations began only after directions were issued by the Minister of Tourism Development to the Tourist Police to investigate the matter following media reports. Ever since the incident in Mirissa was first reported on Monday April 9, I have been closely following the progress of the investigations. (SS)
In fact I personally telephoned the Minister of Law and Order and requested him to carry out a comprehensive investigation and identify the perpetrators of the alleged crime eventhough no complaint had been lodged initially.
He assured me that all measures were being taken to bring the culprits to book as soon as possible, said Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga.
Four suspects were arrested by the Weligama Police on Friday the 13th of April and two others on the 15thfollowing the recording of statements from several witnesses.
Minister said that the affected tourists would be once again called for the inquiry and all their travel and other expenses would be sponsored by Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority.
SLTDA has also launched a separate investigation in to the operation of the establishment.
Minister also requested the Tourism Police to increase beats in tourism areas which in turn will help to irradiate such incidents.
Tourist Hotels Association Chairman, Sanath Ukwatte said this is the first time that such a stern action is taken against this kind of incident by the government and they welcome this move.
Meanwhile SP Ruwan Gunasekera Police Spokesmen said the government has allocated Rs. 80 million from the last budget to set up 20 more tourist Police stations in popular tourist destinations increasing the total to 41 stations.

Sri Lankan worker from Saudi blames SL embassy
A Sri Lankan worker arrived back to the country from Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and made various allegations to the Sri Lankan embassy in Saudi Arabia for sending her without any clothes except the Abaya.
The worker who was identified as Durayalage Yanawathi had lived in Saudi for 18 years and was suffering from blindness.
The news portrayed by some media outlets which state that the worker was brought to the country with only an Abaya is completely false. She was brought through the Sri Lankan embassy in Saudi Arabia following correct protocols, said an official of Sahana Piyasa which acts as the Welfare Centre to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.
The official said that the worker came in a way that any worker would come from a Middle East country. She came with the Muslim attire along with the Abaya which is the normal way of arrival.
We then contacted the police and took measures to find her relatives and we dropped her off to her relatives in Kurunegala during the day, she further said.
Yanawathi was examined by the airport doctors who stated that long term medications could cure all of her illnesses. We would further stay in touch with her and constantly assess her situation, the official said.

SriLankan to enter  next phase of reform plan
SriLankan Airlines is currently at the verge of implementing the second phase of its restructuring plan, which would see the airline become a profitable and self-sufficient entity within a short period.
The restructuring initiatives would see the airline further fine-tune its route network and implement a range of cost optimisation initiatives. It intends to report its audited financial results for FY2017/18, which is required to undergo the review of Auditor General of Sri Lanka, before the end of September 2018, an airline release said.
SriLankan Airlines has achieved a record un-audited annual passenger revenue of Rs. 126.9 billion (US Dollars 830.7 million) for its just ended financial year of 2017/18, the highest ever in the Companys 38-year history.
The revenue comes on the back of recent expansion of the airline to include services to several new destinations such as Gan Islands, Hyderabad and Melbourne and additional frequencies to popular cities in its network.
The airlines cargo division recorded a spectacular performance achieving a revenue of Rs. 14.7 billion on its own.
Both passenger and cargo divisions exceeded their annual target, enabling the SriLankan Airlines Group, bolstered by an even stronger performance at its best performing business unit SriLankan Ground Services to comfortably exceed the overall annual revenue target.
The overall Group turnover exceeded one billion US Dollars, making SriLankan one of the handful of companies in Sri Lanka to reach this milestone. It also becomes the highest revenue generating company amongst all Sri Lankan businesses which publicly report their financials.
This is the first instance of the airline achieving its annual revenue target since Emirates Airline left as the managing partner ten years ago. This comes at a turbulent time for the industry when most airlines are facing difficulty maintaining their yields due to intense competition, SriLankan Airlines CEO, Captain Suren Ratwatte said.
This achievement shows the capability and commitment of our workforce and demonstrates that the Company is well on track with its restructuring targets. With a new Chairman and Board of Directors in place, the airline will reach greater heights in the near future as we concentrate on curtailing our costs.
The airlines Chief Commercial Officer, Siva Ramachandran, added, The next generation at commercial has come to the fore. The future of this Company is in the good hands of young people who are capable of taking it forward.

Stokes aims to restore Englands Test lustre
London, tuesday: Ben Stokes is desperate to inspire England back to the pinnacle of Test cricket, saying the team has slacked off in the past two years, slipping to fifth in the world rankings.
The 26-year-old all-rounder returned to international cricket in February against New Zealand but could not prevent a 1-0 defeat for the tourists to extend a miserable run that has seen England win just one Test series overseas since 2012.
Stokes missed his sides 4-0 Ashes humbling after being suspended from playing for England over a nightclub incident and admitted he was gutted to watch his teammates struggling in Australia. Just two years ago England were one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies but were denied as Pakistan won at the Oval and squared the series.
I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play, Stokes told Britains Guardian newspaper. AFP

Teaching  to touch love
Subjectinterest
I want to be a teacher when I leave school because a good teacher is indispensable. It is he/she that carefully nurtures your mind and makes you delight in learning. That is something I want to do. I want to help my students in the future to love what I am teaching. To take an interest in the subject, said Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara has a taste of what life is outside the comfort of his home. Away from the security of their home, these boy scouts have to really survive in conditions that might be harsh.
I feel my experience in boy scouting has really enhanced my personality. Through scouting I have learnt how to be a man of the world. Through scouting I have received the skills that allow me to achieve my objectives. You learn to find solutions to the challenges that come your way. Life is an adventure. You learn how to conduct yourself in life. You learn to be tough and you get a taste of what life really is. You learn to solve problems that arise between the boys, by being away from your family in the scout camp. You are forced to survive and live in an environment away from home, explained Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara believes that you need to have the correct attitude when evaluating a problem. Hastiness has been the ruin of many plans.
As a Head Prefect firstly we need to know how to rally the team and unite the team. The Head Prefect is tested by this and this is really what marks him as a Leader. This is the sign of his ability to lead. With this come many responsibilities. You need to be able to inspire the team which also tests your patience and your tolerance. You lead by example. When facing a challenge or a problem as the Head Prefect, first you need to assess the problem and its many facets carefully. When looking for a proper solution you need to be mindful that you must evaluate this problem carefully.
Plan of action
You have to understand that no matter how compelling the urge is to act rashly, you need to practice patience and apply yourself to the process of carefully formulating a plan of action by identifying the pros and cons of the situation and the pluses and minuses and most importantly the right thing to do, said Nanayakkara.
Nanayakkara has the right idea because he will always consult a superior, understanding his own inexperience.
I always obtain the counsel of someone wiser than me. When you are young you think you know everything but you dont. So when facing a challenge in life always remember that there may be people who know better than you, said Nanayakkara
Too often because of foolishness, we do not understand the value of education. This is beyond getting good grades. You need to have a sincere desire to learn, understanding that it will all pay off in the end.
My school has given me so much to make my life a success as the Head Boy of Rahula College Matara. In life, you need to have the willingness to accept and receive the knowledge that you are offered. You need to be able to be in touch with reality. So I just want to give back to society what was offered to me. I was a Boy Scout in the scout troupe. I have played various sports. I have also excelled in my education. So I have been gifted with so much from my school, pointed out Nanayakkara.
Model solution
Nanayakkara has a good role model, who is a man who can handle any difficulty with grace and dignity
As the Head Prefect, one person who is my role model and someone I look up to is my Principal  Francis Welege. He is a person with a sound understanding and one who can beautifully solve a problem. Like I mentioned before we must never be rash when searching for a solution. He is a man who knows what to do and how to approach it. I have seen this and I feel that this is the kind of leadership that is essential. He knows how to treat people properly, added Nanayakkara
In life, we are faced with what is right and what is wrong. Your character is moulded by being at school.
This is like our second family, beyond mother and father. At school, children need to be taught a code of ethics. Then you learn to love being ethical. You learn to love doing the right thing. This is what I constantly tell my prefects under me. Love what is good and be disciplined. You need to have morals as well as morale. Character while having skills. Be a service to society, pointed out Nanayakkara.
The day we run out of food or fresh water, is the day we realize that we cannot eat or drink money. A large number of species are facing extinction. The forests are being cut down. Our society is turning into an urban nightmare. Even if you take poverty, just think - there is enough food for everyone in the world. But those politicians are setting up boundaries and not allowing free access to food.
Towards disaster
If you take environmental pollution we are killing the earth. As humans, we pollute our environment. The way we are going we are heading towards disaster. Many species are endangered. Even if you take poverty, that is also due to the actions of the leaders in our world. I am against the harming of animals. When I think of the suffering of animals I am greatly saddened. I think to myself why we are taking the lives of these animals that have done no wrong to us said Nanayakkara.
As mentioned before he is devoted to his school. He loves his parents. The two entities that have given him a bright future.
I have always loved my school. I want to give back to this school. I want to do this to the best of my ability. I also want to say how much I love my parents who have done everything for me. So I want to be a good citizen of the world. My message to young people is that there are a time and a way of doing things for everything. Dont rush this process. Do things according to the times then you will be successful, summed up Nanayakkara.

TNA BLASTS NEW SYSTEM AFTER COUNCIL DEFEAT
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) this week came out strongly against the new mixed electoral system as they failed to gain control of their first urban council after the last local government elections.
The Vavuniya Urban Council on Monday (16) went to the TULF. The TNA had the majority number of eight members being elected to the Council of 21. But the TULF managed to form a coalition of UNPers, SLFPers, SLPP and EPRLF to gain control of the council.
EPRLFs R. Gowthaman was elected as Chairman with 11 votes. TNA Vanni district MP Dr S. Sivamohan yesterday criticised the new mixed electoral system for their defeat and blamed it for allowing a party with just three members elected to gain power in the council.
This new system is very wrong. A person who gets 150 votes can get elected to the council whilst someone who gets 1,500 votes can be left out, he said.
The MP also added that it had allowed for people to bribe their way into power and position.
When asked why the TNA did not resort to alliances rather than criticise the system, Dr Sivamohan pointed out that it was not the policy of the TNA to go for alliances.
In the North the party had worked with other Tamil political parties to gain power in the local government bodies, but Dr Sivamohan insisted that these parties supported the TNA without any favour promised,
It was their choice to support us. We did not promise to appoint a vice chairman or share terms with them.
At the conclusion of Mondays election however, a fight broke out between UNP Vavuniya Organizer, P Karunadasa and Northern Provincial Councillor and brother of Minister Rishard Bathuideen, Rifkaan Bathuideen. The former alleged that Bathuideen had intervened in the election to bribe the four of the UNP members to vote on behalf of the TULF.

U.S. places conditions on aid to Sri Lanka
The United States governments bilateral economic assistance to Sri Lanka is conditional on certain transitional justice mechanisms being established, according to the U.S. spending bill passed last month.
In an explanatory statement attached to the spending bill, Congress said that the USD 35 million would be allocated to Sri Lanka provided, that such funds shall be made available for programmes to assist in the identification and resolution of cases of missing persons.
The bill says that the money will only be made available to the government of Sri Lanka if the U.S. Secretary of State certifies that it is following certain transitional justice mechanisms.
These include repealing laws that do not comply with international standards for arrest and detention by security forces, investigating allegations of arbitrary arrest and torture, supporting a justice mechanism as identified by the United Nations Human Rights Council, and returning military-occupied lands in war-affected areas to their original owners.
In addition, the US government called for substantially reducing the presence of the armed forces in former conflict zones and restructuring the military for a peacetime role that aids in reconciliation.
The bill also states that USD 500,000 in military assistance can only be used in humanitarian and disaster response preparedness and maritime security.
If the Sri Lankan military wants to use money for international UN peacekeeping operations, like a recent group sent to Lebanon, it must show that it is taking effective steps to bring to justice Sri Lankan peacekeeping troops who have engaged in sexual exploitation and abuse, the bill reads.
The U.S. Embassy in Colombo was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday.

Weragampita residents demand throughway
Dr. Hemasiri Abeywickrema Siriwardena Mawatha at the Weragampita bisects along the Matara Beliatta Railway Extension, is blocked due to the new railway line extension.
The surrounding area is densely populated.
Local engineers designed the railway extension and they should be blamed since they never informed the residents that they would lose their throughway due to the railway line. They say they cannot provide us with an alternative route as there are some irregularities when acquiring land for the railway project. Now they pass the blame onto the Chinese contractor to get out of the situation, Chandrasena, a resident in the area said.
My parents gave part of their land to construct Avenue No 1 in Weragampita, Matara. It is known as Dr Hemasiri Abeywickrema Siriwardena Mawatha now, Chandrasena said.
The late Mahanama Samaraweera allocated funds to construct the road. We did not realised that we would lose throughway on completion of the southern railway extension. But that is exactly what has happened. We demand that the railway authorities provide us a throughway, he said.
Over 70 families use this road to travel to and from the Matara town each day and they have to take a a long route now, L G Ruwan Prasad, another resident said.
The road existed before I was born and we did not expect the railway authorities to block it, he said.
Matara Divisional Secretary Darshana Wickremarachchi said the road was used by the public for almost 70 years. He said the demand for a through way was reasonable and hoped that the railway authorities would give due consideration to the matter.
