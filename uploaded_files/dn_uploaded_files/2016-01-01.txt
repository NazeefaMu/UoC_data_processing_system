Australia's Balance wins overall Sydney-Hobart honours
Sydney, Wednesday: Australian 52-footer Balance was Thursday crowned the overall winner of the Sydney to Hobart race, after overcoming the roughest conditions in years which forced dozens of yachts to retire.
Balance was awarded the Tattersall's Cup -- handicap honours for the vessel that performs best according to size -- after main rival and one of the smallest competing boats, local 33-footer Quikpoint Azzurro, missed a pre-dawn arrival deadline.
American 100-footer supermaxi Comanche was first over the finish line -- completing the 628-nautical-mile course in two days, eight hours, 58 minutes and 30 seconds to be the first victorious US entry since 1998.
Finishing second and third in the line honours was Ragamuffin 100 and another American entrant, Rambler.
Quikpoint Azzurro finished up in third place overall with a time of four days, 18 hours, 37 minutes and 59 seconds, behind French 35-footer Courrier Leon, which reached Hobart after four days, five hours, 28 minutes and 53 seconds.
Balance -- which won the race in 2008 under the name Quest -- had finished seventh in line honours with a time of three days, three hours, 50 minutes and 45 seconds.
Owner-skipper Paul Clitheroe, 60, said it was an "absolute honour" to win the blue water classic with his 10-year-old yacht, which has now taken out handicap honours in two out of five Sydney to Hobart attempts.
"I thought the little boat had beaten us, until the Derwent River decided otherwise," the financial guru said.
Some 108 yachts had left Sydney on Saturday, battling strong winds and punishing conditions as they headed towards Hobart's Constitution Dock on the island state of Tasmania, with more than 30 boats unable to complete the race.
Owner-skipper of second-placed Courrier Leon, Gery Trentesaux, said he had bought a whole new sail wardrobe, including a heavy maxi spinnaker, as he knew the race conditions would be tough.
"We did this because I broke all the sails with the Beneteau 45 in the 2008 race," he said.
"I also told the builder we had to do this race.
"They asked what it would take to psych me up to race. I said, 'the Rolex Sydney Hobart', so here we are, with Michel Quintin, who used to own Lady Courrier."
Quikpoint Azzurro's owner Shane Kearns told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation the lack of wind in the pond-like Derwent River in the final stretch of the race was "frustrating". "We really wanted to come first. But there was just no wind," said Kearns, who had bought the boat on his credit card for Aus$23,000 (US$16,800).
"And then the cruellest cut of all at the end there, we lost second by a couple of minutes.
"So sailing can be a fun and cruel sport all in one go."
The most prominent retirements were last year's champion Wild Oats XI, an eight-time line honours winner, and supermaxi Perpetual Loyal.
Comanche was also damaged during the race, hitting an unidentified submerged object which broke one of her twin rudders and a daggerboard. AFP

Fiery net spell sees Sri Lanka turn tables on New Zealand
NEW ZEALAND, Thursday: A cracking 91 by Tillakaratne Dilshan after a fiery net session set Sri Lanka up for an eight-wicket victory over New Zealand in Nelson on Thursday to keep their one-day series alive.
Sri Lanka knocked off their 277-run target with 22 balls to spare in a remarkable turnaround after being outplayed in the first two matches.
In addition to Dilshans heroics, Lahiru Thirimanne cracked an unbeaten 87 and Danushka Gunathilaka made 65.
Danushka Gunathilaka gave Sri Lanka a blazing start in their chase of 277 smashing seven fours and four sixes in his 45-ball 65 that gave him the Man of the Match award in the third ODI against New Zealand at Nelson on Wednesday. AFP
Dinesh Chandimal was not out 27 at the end as the match followed the same formula as the first two where the team that lost the toss batted second and dominated.
Gunathilaka said it was a must-win game and non-playing speedster Suranga Lakmal sharpened the players up when he hit several in the nets the previous day.
Thats true, we talked about that and how now we are okay, he said.
Angelo (Mathews) and (Milinda) Siriwardana were hit on the head and Dilshan hit in the face.
We talked about how we have to be positive and we cant have negative thoughts because certainly this New Zealand side is a very strong side and they are a very good bowling attack.
New Zealand now lead the series 2-1 with two matches remaining.
Batting first in the opening matches on faster wickets in Christchurch, Dilshan, Thirimanne and Gunathilaka posted a total of 43 runs from their combined six innings.
But they were more at home on the accommodating Saxton Oval where Dilshan took 92 balls for his 91 and stood in partnerships of 98 with Gunathilaka and 111 with Thirimanne.
New Zealand strike bowlers Tim Southee and Adam Milne were belted out of the attack in five overs.
Doug Bracewell was brought on in the sixth over to arrest the onslaught only to have Gunathilaka smack his first ball for six to bring up Sri Lankas 50.
It was the introduction of New Zealands fourth quick, Mitchell McClenaghan, that snapped the opening stand when Gunathilaka was caught by Ross Taylor at first slip for 65.
Dilshan was run out when turned back by Thirimanne when attempting a difficult single.
In contrast to Sri Lankas rollicking performance, the New Zealand innings showed signs of rust after so few batsmen had a chance to get in the middle in the first two games.
Kane Williamsons 59 was the only score to better a half-century.
Williamson, deputising as captain in place of the injured Brendon McCullum, was dropped on 30 and added a further 29 runs before meekly yielding his wicket when he slapped a full toss from Siriwardana to Dushmantha Chameera at mid-on.
Chameera had an impressive game, as did the other Sri Lankan novice Jeffrey Vandersay.
In addition to the valuable catch to remove Williamson, the 23-year-old Chameera claimed the wickets of Martin Guptill (30) and Henry Nicholls (20) and ran out Mitchell Santner (38).
When New Zealand looked to be lining themselves up for a big score on a wicket that suggested an innings of 300-plus, Vandersay removed Tom Latham for 42 and Ross Taylor without scoring in three deliveries.
They were the first ODI wickets for the 25-year-old leg-spinner playing in his second international.
Bracewells career best 30 off 34 and Southees 18 off four balls in the final over gave the New Zealand innings a late boost.
The fourth ODI is in Nelson on Saturday.

McCoy leads British sports stars in New Year Honours List
LONDON, WEDNESDAY: Legendary jump jockey Tony McCoy was awarded a knighthood in the New Year Honours List out Wednesday, in which British sports stars including Chris Froome were recognised for their achievements.
Tony McCoy
Two-time Tour de France winner Froome, 1964 Formula One world champion John Surtees and five-time world snooker champion Ronnie O'Sullivan were among those honoured. Stars from football, tennis and boxing were among those made commanders (CBE), officers (OBE) or regular members (MBE) of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, an order of chivalry.
McCoy, who becomes entitled to use the prefix Sir, rode 4,358 winners in his extraordinary career.
The 41-year-old retired from racing in April after being crowned British jump racing champion jockey for a 20th consecutive year. "It is an unbelievable privilege and honour to receive a knighthood in the New Year Honours List. I certainly wasn't expecting it," the Northern Irishman said.
"I consider myself lucky to have had a job I loved.
"The support from the public and racing community since my retirement has been overwhelming.
"A knighthood really tops off what's been a crazy and memorable year."
Tour de France defending champion Froome said he was "extremely humbled and proud" to be made an OBE after he became the first Briton to win cycling's premier road race on two occasions with his victory in July.
O'Sullivan, 40, arguably the most naturally-gifted snooker player of all time, was recognised with the OBE.
He won the 2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013 world crowns.
Last year he said he did not feel he had done anything to merit an honour, only snooker titles.
"It came as a great surprise to receive my OBE," he said.
"I am extremely grateful for this recognition which is a great honour and has made both myself and my family very proud."

Messi scores on his 500th appearance for Barca
BARCELONA, WEDNESDAY: Four-time World Player of the Year Lionel Messi has warned Barcelona's rivals that the European champions are determined to match their five-trophy haul from 2015 in the coming year.
Messi scored on his 500th appearance for the club as Barca rounded off the year in style with a 4-0 win over Real Betis to move back to the top of La Liga on Wednesday.
The Catalans lead Atletico Madrid on goal difference and Real Madrid by two points as well as having a game in hand on their rivals from the Spanish capital.
And having won the Champions League, La Liga, Copa del Rey, UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup in the past 12 months, Barca also set a new record of 180 goals in a calendar year.
"It has been a spectacular year and we wanted to finish it this way," said Messi.
"It will be difficult to improve on what we have done, but we always try. We have a great squad that are desperate to continue winning."
Barca were given a helping hand on their return to action after a shorter than normal 10-day winter break in Spain, though, as they were awarded a controversial penalty when Antonio Adan clashed with Messi after punching the ball to safety.
Neymar's resulting spot-kick came off the bar, but Heiko Westermann turned the ball into his own net from the rebound and thereafter Barca were only denied an even greater rout by a series of fine saves by Adan and the woodwork.
A lovely one-two between Neymar and Messi allowed the later to slot home his 425th Barca goal before a Luis Suarez double rounded off the scoring in the second-half. "We just came back from the holidays so it is normal that the rhythm dips a bit and the games at the Club World Cup always take their toll," added Messi.
"Possibly it wasn't a great game, but we managed to do the most important thing which was to win and start another important period well."
And Barca boss Luis Enrique echoed the sentiments of his star player as he focused on starting the new year with victory away to Espanyol in the Barcelona derby on Saturday. AFP

Relaxing and Meaningful Holiday
Batticaloa is a pretty little city tucked away on an island, surrounded by a gorgeous lagoon. Batticaloa district has many places of interest including the famous Golden Beach of Passikudah, Kalkudah and not to mention Arugam Bay which is one the best beaches in the world for surfing.
Opened six months ago with 10 Deluxe Rooms, Hotel Nirutha is one place to check out as it accommodates within one's budget. The hotel atmosphere and friendly staff like Rasika and Chamara will give a relaxing and meaningful holiday to a busy life. The hotel comes with all necessary amenities and it is very close to the golden beach of Passikudah.
"I had very good opportunities to invest money in developing new business in the UK, but as a Sri Lankan I had to give back to my motherland that gave me so much. My moral obligation was to help the people of Batticaloa who have recovered from a 30 year civil war and piecing together their lives after the devastating Tsunami. I left to London 25 years ago and currently living there with my family. But we have to respect our native place and I would like to give more opportunities to my village people to work at my hotel", Hotel Nirutha proprietor Sam Venugopal stated in a release.
The name of this hotel comes from putting together his mother's name Nirmala and daughter's name Samrutha to form Hotel Nirutha.
"All the interior design was carefully chosen to represent the peace and tranquility of Batticaloa, its cultures and this was only possible by Yamuna de Fonseka (interior designer) and has had her hands on many of the holiday resorts in Sri Lanka. " he added.
"We never use artificial flavours to our food. We are using natural flavours and ingredients which are specially shipped from London. We are specialized in Italian Pizzas. We offer both Sri Lankan and Western food but we are very well trained to make authentic Indian food too. All the equipment in our kitchen and many hotel items were imported from London and we have a 50 pax conference hall too", Management Consultant H R Hewawasam stressed.
The Batticaloa Lagoon, which is the largest lagoon in the island runs along the famous Lady Manning Bridge popularly known as the Kallady Bridge that connects Batticaloa town to the rest of the eye catching villages, features extensive mangrove swamps and some sea grass beds that attract a wide variety of water birds. The lagoon is famous for its Singing Fish where on Full Moon nights, during the period of April to September, a faint but distinct musical sound resembling a plucked guitar rises from the lagoon waters in the area along the Kallady Bridge, a couple of kilometres off the town centre of Batticaloa. The mysterious music is attributed to a noise emanated from some form of a marine life found in the lagoon. The best way to listen to the music is to dip the end of an oar into the water and hold the other end to one's ear.
The Batticaloa Light House called Muttuwaran Lighthouse which was built by the British in the year 1913 is located where the Batticaloa lagoon meets the Indian Ocean along the Bar Road. The solid looking Batticaloa Fort with hulking walls, the most picturesque of the small Dutch forts of Sri Lanka was built by the Portuguese in 1628. The fort guarded by four bastions, protected by the sea from 2 sides and by a moat on other 2 sides, was captured by the Dutch from the Portuguese in 1638. It was the first Portuguese fort in Sri Lanka captured by the Dutch. In the year 1772, the fort fell to the British.
When making a booking at this property, one can easily visit Passikudah, Kalkudah, Arugam Bay beaches, Iginiyagala Dam and the Iginiyagala bird sanctuary. Some of the villages still use the traditional methods in baking fresh bread, traditional methods in fishing, Brick Kilns, toddy tapping, farming and agriculture. On a fine day guests could enjoy a fishing trip in a catamaran.

Richie McCaw awarded New Zealand's highest honour
WELLINGTON, WEDNESDAY: Celebrated All Blacks captain Richie McCaw has sidestepped a knighthood and been awarded New Zealand's supreme honour -- the Order of New Zealand, which recognises the country's "most respected people".
The announcement was made in the country's New Year's honours list which was released Thursday, McCaw's 35th birthday.
After McCaw this year led the All Blacks to World Cup victory, making them the first side to win consecutive tournaments (2011 and 2015), many New Zealanders including Prime Minister John Key believed he was worthy of a knighthood.
However, the champion flanker and three-times world player of year, who has said he would not feel comfortable being addressed as "Sir Richie", has gone one better.
The Order of New Zealand (ONZ), the highest honour in the country's system, carries no title but recognises "outstanding service" to the country and is restricted to 20 living members at any one time.
McCaw becomes the youngest holder of the title, eclipsing former prime minister and World Trade Organisation director-general Mike Moore who was 50 when he was made a member. Others on the list include another former All Black captain, Brian Lochore; golfer Bob Charles, and former prime minister and now United Nations Development Programme administrator Helen Clark.
One level below the ONZ are the knights and dames who this year include prominent film director Jane Campion, and in a country renowned for an agricultural lifestyle, champion sheep shearer David Fagan.
McCaw, who retired after the World Cup, described himself as "an ordinary boy ... extremely privileged to join the distinguished company of men and women who have been awarded the Order of NZ."
New Zealand Rugby chief Steve Tew described McCaw as "the most influential player of his generation, if not of all time."
During a 15-year career, he played a world record 148 Tests and only tasted defeat 15 times. AFP

SC allows five individuals to contest SLC elections
The Supreme Court yesterday permitted five individuals including former vice president of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) K. Mathivanan whose nominations had been rejected, to contest the upcoming Sri Lanka Cricket elections.
Despite the Supreme Court having delivered this order on December 18 following a settlement reached by all parties concerned, the Court had to make a clarification since then presiding Judge Eva Wanasundara did not put her signature on the judgment. It is learnt that Justice Eva Wanasundara is currently overseas.
When the matter came up before special Supreme Court bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice K.T. Chitrasiri, the court affirmed the earlier judgment.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court allowed K. Mathivanan, Asanga Seneviratne, Nihal Lewke, Sujeewa Lokuhewa and Easman Narangoda to contest the Sri Lanka Cricket elections scheduled for the January 3, 2016.
The Court made this order consequent to a petition filed by K. Mathivanan. He sought an interim order requiring the Director General of Sports to permit the nomination of the petitioner to be elected to the post of vice president of Sri Lanka Cricket.

The top 10 Test spells in 2015
From Yasir Shah and Ravichandran Ashwins captivating varieties of spin to Stuart Broads destruction and Wahab Riazs swing, here is a look at the top ten Test bowling efforts of the year.
Yasir Shah - 7/76 v Sri Lanka, Galle
Pakistan Test captain Misbah-ul-Haqs go-to man put in his best performance during a superb year in the victory in Galle, his 7/76 being the best figures by an overseas bowler in Tests in Sri Lanka. The visitors had taken a lead of 117 and Sri Lanka were left to counter on a fourth-day pitch. Before stumps, the legspinner removed Dimuth Karunaratne for 79 and Kumar Sangakkara for 18. On the fifth morning he bowled Dilruwan Perera without a run added, then claimed the skipper Angelo Mathews for five before closing in on the Sri Lankan tail. Those seven wickets spun Pakistan to a ten-wicket win.
Mitchell Johnson - 3/53 & 3/27 v England, Lords
I hope so. That would be nice to have those scars come back out. That was Johnson after the second day at Lords when asked whether his left-arm fast bowling could cue memories of his 37-wicket Ashes 18 months earlier.
Johnsons two-wicket burst had helped reduce England to 85/4 at the end the day, trailing by 481 runs, following Australias declaration at 566/8. Johnson first removed Gary Ballance by bowling the left-hander with a lovely outswinger that snuck under the bat, then eight balls later had Joe Root nicking a back-foot drive to Peter Nevill. The packed crowd was in shock. England were four wickets down in 11 overs, with Johnson the chief destroyer.
On day four, Johnson grabbed 3/27 and effected a direct hit run-out as England crumbled to a 405-run defeat on day four - their fourth-heaviest loss in terms of runs. Johnson began with the wicket of Alastair Cook who flashed a cut to Nevill, then his lethal throw ran out Ben Stokes, followed by the dismissals of Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali.
James Anderson - 6/47 v Australia, Edgbaston
Anderson said after the first days play that England hadnt expected the Edgbaston pitch to do as much as it did. But they were mighty chuffed that it had, and none more then Englands greatest wicket-taker. A day before he turned 33, Anderson ripped out his best Ashes figures of 6/47 to bowl Australia out for 136 after Michael Clarke chose to bat. On a surface with a covering of grass but dry and even a little cracked underneath, and under slightly overcast conditions, Anderson pinged David Warner in his crease very early but it was his second spell that really unhinged the Australians. Returning in the 20th over, he took four wickets for seven runs in a half hour of swing bowling of the highest class. It was a fitting reply from a champion bowler after his wicketless outing at Lords - his first in six years. And it put England back ahead 2-1 after a humbling defeat in the second Test.

Stuart Broad - 8/15 v Australia, Trent Bridge
With all due respect to Phil Tufnells 7/66 in that 1997 cracker at The Oval, not since Bob Willis 8/43 at Headingley in 1981 has an England bowler achieved such a break-out performance. This was Australias worst performance in years, and where they surrendered the Ashes. Their 18.3 over innings was the shortest in Test history; never before had the fourth, fifth and sixth wickets fallen so early, and at no time in Ashes history had extras contributed the most to a scorecard. Leading the way was Broad, hero extraordinaire with an astounding spell of 9.3-5-15-8, his career best in Tests and the eighth best for England in Tests. From 60 all out, there was no way Clarkes team were going to save this match. By stumps, England led by 214 runs after Joe Root scored a fine 124 not out. It was an Ashes pace-bowling special to rank alongside Glenn McGraths 8/38, Jason Gillespies 7/37 and Bob Massies 8/53 - except this time, an Englishman was the one doing the damage.
R Ashwin - 6/46 v Sri Lanka, Galle
Ishant Sharma was disciplined. Varun Aaron was wasteful after his first spell, conceding 34 in four overs during his last spell. Harbhajan Singh was wicketless across eight overs, never having any Sri Lankan batsman in trouble. Amit Mishra found himself on a hat-trick in his last over, but that owed to a rash shot from Dinesh Chandimal and a nothing shot from Sri Lankas No 10. R Ashwin finished with figures of 13.4-2-46-6 and he was, by far, the best bowler on view. Tidy, economical, aggressive, crafty. There was flight, dip, turn and bounce - all four elements of spin bowling in full display. Backed by some fine catching, Ashwin bagged his best figures outside of India (his previous and only five-wicket haul was in Bangladesh in June).
Rangana Herath - 7/48 v India, Galle
After bowling 33 wicketless overs during Indias first innings - the second time since 2000 that he had bowled that many without success in Galle - it was perhaps to be expected that the 37-year-old spinner would have a say on proceedings on day three, with the surface expected to turn as the match wore on, Herath was always going to be tricky. Starting off with the wicket of nightwatchman Ishant with his first delivery, Herath bowled 18 consecutive overs for figures of 6/35 to completely derail any aspirations that India had of chasing 176. Herath ended with his best figures in Galle and this superb performance extended his overall tally at the venue to 68 at an average of 25.73 and strike-rate of 58.4. Wriddhiman Sahas wicket took Herath past Bishan Bedi, making him the third-most successful left-arm spinner in the history of Test cricket. Im carrying a bit of an injury so its been tough, but when youre playing for your country you have to give 100 percent, said a pleased Herath afterwards.
Adil Rashid - 5/64 v Pakistan, Abu Dhabi
A unique debut for Rashid, the England leg spinner. The first half of his long-awaited debut could not have gone anywhere near as planned: 34 overs, 163 runs, zero wickets to pass Australian Bryce McGains 0/149 as the most expensive figures for a Test newbie. The second half was astonishing, for a different reason. Getting better drift as the Abu Dhabi surface started to wear, Rashid took 5/64 to almost fire England to an unlikely win. In reply to Pakistans first innings of 523/8, England had made 598/9 thanks to Cooks marathon 263. In a hurry, Rashid ran through Pakistan to bowl them out for 173, setting the visitors a target of 99. Giving the ball plenty of air and bowling attacking lines, Rashid preyed on the Pakistan batsmens techniques and temperament, and as the pressure built, some panicky shots added to his column. It was a stirring performance in what ended as a superb, dramatic Test match.
Wahab Riaz - 4/66 v England, Dubai
Pakistans victory over England in the second Test - coming after that gripping draw in the series opener - bore the stamp of Yasir, but it was Wahabs exceptional spell on the third morning that really swung the pendulum the home teams way. In nine back-breaking overs featuring high pace and tasty reverse-swing under a hot sun, the left-arm quick accounted for Root (88), Stokes (4) and Buttler (0) for just 15 runs, each of the batsmen caught behind, as England went from 206/4 to 212/6, eventually all out for 242. It was captivating and clinical stuff. For that brilliant spell, Wahab was named Man of the Match, beating Yasirs 8/180 on return to the side.
Ravindra Jadeja - 5/21 v South Africa, Mohali
In his first Test match since August 2014, when he was dropped during a lean run on unresponsive English pitches, Jadeja made an emphatic performance to claim the Man-of-the-Match award. His crowning glory was taking 5/21 on day three, accounting for Vernon Philander, Hashim Amla, Dane Vilas, Simon Harmer and Imran Tahir. Set a target of 218 on a square turner, South Africa were bowled out for 109. The tourists sent Philander to open the innings with Dean Elgar, but the experiment failed spectacularly with Jadeja striking him in line with the stumps first ball.Amlas decision to not offer a shot to Jadeja was fatal, the the regulation arm ball going on to hit middle stump. The score read 10/3 and South Africa were doomed. Say what you will about his limitations away from home, but in India Jadeja continues to be a lethal weapon in Tests.
Josh Hazlewood - 6/70 v New Zealand, Adelaide
In a low-scoring historic first ever day-night Test at Adelaide Oval, young Australian quick Hazlewood was the stand-out exponent of the pink ball. His three wickets had been crucial to Australia bowling New Zealand out for 202, but the hosts had a lead of just 22 to work with and were hit by the inability for an injured Mitchell Starc to bowl. Up stepped Hazlewood with a career-best six-wicket haul in a relentless performance of quality pace and movement, accounting for Tom Latham, Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, BJ Watling, Mark Craig and Trent Boult. New Zealand were limited to 208 in their second innings, and Australia completed a nervous three-wicket victory for a 2-0 series win.

World welcomes New Year despite terror fears
Millions of people around the world welcomed in the New Year on high security alert, with Munich stations evacuated over an imminent terror threat and fireworks canceled in Paris and Brussels, while a huge fire ripped through a Dubai hotel.

German police warned people to stay away from two of Munich's railway stations and avoid large gatherings after "indications that a terror attack" was being planned by Islamists in the southern German city.

Authorities said early Friday the threat involved a suspected suicide bomb attack by the Islamic State group. A police spokeswoman told AFP they had "reliable information" that the plot targeted festivities under way on New Year's Eve.

Elsewhere in Europe, terror fears also loomed large, with firework displays canceled in Brussels and Paris, just weeks after jihadists killed 130 people on the streets of the French capital.

More than 100,000 police were deployed throughout France to guard celebrations, as defiant Parisians turned out on the Champs Elysees to greet 2016 in the biggest public gatherings since the November 13 attacks.

In his New Year address, President Francois Hollande said France "has not finished with terrorism yet" and that the threat of another attack "remains at its highest level."

Belgian police were holding five people over an alleged New Year attack plot in Brussels, as well as arresting a 10th suspect over the Paris attacks.

In Dubai, a vast blaze ripped through a luxury 63-story hotel, the Address Downtown, close to the world's tallest tower where people had gathered to ring in the New Year.

But authorities put on a spectacular show, refusing to let the hotel blaze, which injured 16 people, disrupt celebrations.

Festivities went ahead as planned and crowds cheered the arrival of 2016 with bursts of light and color in a massive fireworks show starting at the landmark Burj Khalifa skyscraper, even as smoke billowed from the nearby blaze.

- 'Choice target for terrorists' -

Sydney, traditionally the first to host a major New Year's bash, kicked off the global festivities when it lit up the skies with pyrotechnics at the stroke of midnight (1300 GMT Thursday).

In Britain, Scotland Yard said around 3,000 officers were deployed across central London in what was reported to be an unprecedented anti-terror security effort.

- Party at the pyramids, on the beach -

In the United States, authorities said they had arrested and charged a 25-year-old American Muslim convert over an alleged attempt to launch a New Year's Eve attack in upstate New York in the name of the Islamic State group.

In New York City, despite a pledge of tight security, one million people are expected to turn out to see the Times Square ball descend.

An estimated two million people were expected to ring in 2016 on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach, with the Brazilian city hosting this year's Olympics.

Alongside the party, swarms of worshipers dressed in white were to take to the beach and wade into the ocean to leave offerings for Yemanja, the goddess of the sea in the Afro-Brazilian Candomble faith.
