Bullet Samaraweera - like no other
He was a victim to a bullet that pierced his leg. His and our hopes for the brilliant cricketing career were dashed. But in Thilan Thusara Samaraweeras mind this was the very reason he was determined to come back with a vengeance. Such fighters in life on and off the field are rare. They are unique. He regained his batting  Black Belt in a way that dazzled those of us who were convinced that there was no way he can make a come back to the turf. But the doughty fighter that Samaraweera was confounded everybody.
Disaster struck the Sri Lankan cricket team when terrorists mounted an attack after the second days play in the Second Test between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in Lahore in 2009 and the cricketer who took the brunt of the attack was Samaraweera.
Bullet penetration
Samaraweera took a bullet that penetrated 12 inches into his left thigh. He needed immediate surgery and spent four months in crutches, not only physically wounded, but having to suffer the trauma and mental agony. Doctors had said he would never play cricket again.
But the doughty fighter that he was, he hit the doubting Thomas for six as he came back four months later to front up to Pakistan again in Galle. The injury retarded his natural stroke play, but yet made scores of 31 and 34 and gave indications that he would soon regain his form of old. Samaraweera was not a batsman who would have had spectators pressurizing the turnstiles and leaving it creaking for more oil. But he had the technique, temperament and the patience that is very essential to make waves in the established game. Hundreds and double hundreds came naturally to this talented right hand batsman who continued to frustrate opposing bowlers.
Samaraweera was born on September 22, 1976 had his schooling at one of the leading Buddhist Institutions Ananda College which institution gave to the game cricketers illustrious such as the Wettimuny brothers, Mithra, Sunil and Sidat, Ajit de Silva and 1996 World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga to name a few.
Tantalizing off spin
He began his career as an off spin bowler. Although his tantalizing off spinners did not produce a rich harvest of wickets nor did it earn him a place in the national Test team, it was his dogged batting, where he had the penchant to make big scores that earned him his Test cap which is the dream of every budding cricketer.
He made the national selectors take notice of his heavy scoring in domestic cricket for the Sinhalese Sports Club and they were forced to give him the big break and he made his entry into the big game in 2001 against the Indians and in the Third and Final test achieved a dream when batting at number eight he made an unbeaten 108 which signaled his arrival that was to last 81 Tests and 53 one-day games in a career that lasted for over 15 years. With several talented players knocking at the door for national representation it was to his credit that he lasted that long.
However like all best batsmen do, he suffered a blip in his batting form in 2005/06 and suffered the humiliation of being dropped from the national team. He was ignored for more than a year. But being the determined fighter, he did not throw in the towel but returned to big time cricket in 2009 and made that year the most memorable and in the 11 Test matches he played he made 1,234 runs and had a fantastic average of 72.58.
Four grand hundreds
Samaraweera hit four grand hundreds and his two double hundreds against Pakistan being grandstand stuff. His highest score was 231 and in the same year he partnered the majestic Mahela Jayawardena and was involved in a record stand of 437 for the fourth wicket which is still the test of time in Test cricket. What batting achievement he treasures and holds dear is the consecutive double hundreds -231 in the First Test against Pakistan in Karachi and the 214 he made in the Second Test in Lahore.
Samaraweera was known to showcase his best when his team was in a crisis. His knocks rescued his team from many precarious situations. We remember with nostalgia the 125 he made against the West Indies at Port of Spain in 2008. Against South Africa in Durban in 2011 he made 102. Then against the same opposition in 2012 he made an unbeaten 115 in Cape Town. Then in 2004 he made 100 against Pakistan in Faisalabad which were memorable knocks.
The likeable and soft spoken Samaraweera played for many teams during his 15 year reign. Not only did he sport the countrys colours but also contributed with both bat and ball for Colts Cricket Club, Sinhalese Sports Club, Sri Lanka A, Sri Lanka Board Presidents X1 and Kandurata. He also became one of the fortunate cricketers to play for the sauce county Worcestership in England and also for Bangladesh Club Brothers Union.
First Test victims
Samaraweeras first victims in Tests and ODIS were Sourav Ganguly and Nayan Mongia of India and what is interesting is that he made his first Test century also against India. His elder brother Dulip also played for Sri Lanka in Tests and ODIS. SAMARAWEERAS contributions and talent did not go unnoticed. The Australian Cricket Board invited him to be their batting consultant an at present serves in that capacity for Bangladesh the team of the moment that has former Sri Lankan opener Chandika Hathurusinghe as head coach.
SAMARAWEERS statistics for posterity  TESTS 81  RUNS 5462  HIGHEST 231  HUNDREDS -14  FIFTIES  30. BOWLING  TESTS 81  WICKETS -15  BEST 4 for 49. ODIS  53  RUNS 862  HIGHEST 105 not out  HUNDREDS 2  FIFTIES - nil. BOWLING - 11 wkts  BEST 3 for 34. FIRST CLASS  271 matches  RUNS 15,501  HIGHEST 231  HUNDREDS 43  FIFTIES 76. BOWLING  271 matches  RUNS 8366  WICKETS 357  BEST 6 for 55.
Samaraweera will not only join the hall of legends, but also the hall of fame for being the first cricketer to take a bullet and when doctors predicted finis to his career to cock a snook at his detractors and come back again like the Phoenix that had risen from the ashes.

Government adheres to legal framework regarding refugees
The Government will never act outside the existing legal framework or the correct practice in connection with the refugee problem.
It has never decided to grant Sri Lanka citizenship or a resident visa to any refugee either, stated the Ministry of Law and Order and Southern Development in a press release, yesterday.
The release said people and organisations with narrow political objectives were trying to mislead the public through false information and threaten the country's communal and religious harmony by using the Rohingya refugee crisis created due to the internal political situation in Myanmar.
Therefore, we should express our regret about the illegal action taken on September 26 while a group of Rohingya refugees handed over to the UNHCR by the government were temporarily accommodated in Ratmalana held in detention by the UNHCR. Three police officers were also injured during this incident. After this dispute, the Rohingya people were sent to a detention camp in Boosa at the request of the UNHCR.

According to the spokesman, Minister Senaratne had ordered relevant officials to plan the project as soon as possible and to complete the construction work within a period of three years.
Instructions were also given to officials to take measures to prevent flood damage.
Around 135,000 consumers receive drinking water from the Kethhena water supply scheme in the Kalutara district and over 60,000 consumers are facing difficulties without drinking water for the past six months.
This is due to salt (sea) water getting mixed with drinking water through the estuary of Kalu River, the Minister said.

BASL expresses concern over Maldives lawyer intimidation
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) in statement yesterday expressed shock and astonishment to note the unjust and harsh treatment of lawyers in the Republic of Maldives and the disturbing manner in which they have been harassed and intimidated in order to suppress their voices and dissent.
BASL Secretary Amal Randeniya said that the BASL is of the strong opinion that all parties concerned in the Maldives must ensure an environment is created for the lawyers in the Republic to engage in their profession with dignity and respect and without fear or favour.
Statement by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka: The BASL is perturbed by the recent development which had taken place in the Republic of Maldives concerning the legal profession in which at least 54 lawyers, representing almost one-third of the Maldivian Bar, have been charged for the alleged offense of contempt of court for filing a petition demanding the Rule of Law be upheld in the nation.
Every lawyer, irrespective of the territory in which he/she engages in their profession, has a legal and moral obligation to strive hard to uphold the Rule of Law and to stand up for the Rule of law.
The United Nations Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers provides a framework regarding international norms for lawyers and their rights, duties and privileges.
The right to engage in a profession is a universal right recognised by the Untied Nations. Article 23.1 of the universal Declaration of Human Rights states:
Everyone has the right to work, to free choice of employment, to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment.Lawyers are an integral part of society and should be able to perform their duties to their fullest extent, without fear or favour. The optimal functioning of the legal profession is vital in upholding the Rule of Law in a prosperous and effective democracy.
Therefore, BASL respectfully urges the President, the Vice-President and the Government of the Republic of Maldives to intervene and to ensure safety and security of the lawyers together with their right to engage in the profession,the BASL statement said.

Chandimal's laboured ton keeps Sri Lanka ahead

Sri Lanka fans had hoped their team would suck less in this series than they had against India, but not even the most optimistic would have thought Sri Lanka would fail to suck for quite this length of time.
They have put together seven good hours of batting now, going to lunch at 322 for 5, having suffered only one setback in this session, and two in all the previous day. With the pitch beginning to take more turn, and three spinners in their ranks, they are better placed than the opposition.
Captain Dinesh Chandimal headed the resistance: his 109 not out off 291 balls was barely watchable, but invaluable given its context.
Not only is it Chandimal's first triple-figure score as Test captain, it has helped Sri Lanka surpass 300 for the first time in four Tests, and has put serious overs in the legs of the Pakistan bowlers.
The seam-bowling trio of Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Abbas and Hasan Ali have now bowled 67 overs between them, while Yasir Shah has sent down 46 overs of legspin.
Teams often aim to defang Yasir while tiring him out - a strategy Sri Lanka had used to moderately good effect at the end of their series against Pakistan in Sri Lanka, two years ago.
At many points in this innings, Chandimal had seemed to suffer from inertia, and the beginning of day two was much the same.
Having begun the morning on 60, he scored only two runs off his first 20 balls. At the other end, Niroshan Dickwella set off with characteristic spunk, needing only four balls to move from his overnight 42, to a half-century.
Dickwella was not reckless - as he sometimes can be - but unlike Chandimal, he was constantly looking for scoring opportunities. Balls skidded past the cordon after taking a thick outside edge, other deliveries were scythed to the backward square leg rope, and when Yasir came into the attack, Dickwella even ventured the reverse-sweep against the turn, collecting a boundary with that stroke.
Otherwise he ran regular singles into the outfield, and generally seemed the more comfortable of the two men at the crease.
That is until his dismissal. Dickwella had repeatedly found runs to third man, off the seamers, and Hasan eventually used that to his advantage.
Having moved the semi-new ball away from Dickwella, off the seam, he drew the batsman's inside edge with a ball that jagged back, and the ball would ricochet into the stumps - the second such wicket Hasan has claimed in this innings.
Dickwella had made 83 off 117 balls, and the partnership with Chandimal worth 134.
While Chandimal continued to amble, Dilruwan Perera's rate of progress made his captain's run-scoring seem rapid by comparison.
For 32 deliveries, he was scoreless, and in that time, survived two close lbw shouts. On both occasions - once off Yasir, and the other off the bowling of Haris Sohail - Perera had been given out, but was found to have edged the ball on review.
Even the excitement of Chandimal reaching his century with a sumptuous cover drive could not shake Perera out of his torpor. In the penultimate over before lunch, he found his first runs, and remains not out on 4 off 37.

Christian Reformed Church continues Service
The Christian Reformed Church, formerly known as the Dutch Reformed Church, will celebrate 375 years on October 6. A tri-lingual service of thanksgiving to celebrate this milestone is planned at the Christian Reformed Church in Galle on October 5.
This anniversary is a testament to the faith of generations of ministers, ministry workers, evangelists and the community of believers in Sri Lanka who stayed true to the teachings of the reformed faith, continuing to teach Biblically-sound doctrine and espousing the catechism of faith.
The Church works and ministers to people in all three languages and has worship services in multiple locations across the country: in the Colombo district, worship services are held at the Christian Reformed Churches at Wolfandal in Colombo 15, Regent Street near the General Hospital, Dehiwela, Kohuwela, Wellawatte, Bambalapitiya, Maligakande and Rukmalgama.
The Church buildings in Galle, Matara, Kalpitiya and the Wolfandal Church in Colombo have all been declared as historical buildings with archaeological value and cultural significance.
The history of the Christian Reformed Church is intrinsically linked to period of Dutch colonisation in the country. The first visit of Dutch sailors to Sri Lanka is recorded in 1600, and in 1602 the Treaty was signed with the King of Kandy, King Wimaladharmasuriya I, allowing the Dutch to build the fortresses along the coast. Official ministry of the Dutch Reformed Church began on October 6, 1642 in the Fort of Galle. That same year, the Reformed faith of the Dutch colonists was established as the official religion of the colony, giving the church both stature and resources to expand. As the Dutch expanded their governance across the coastline of Sri Lanka, the Reformed faith went with them. In the early years, the Dutch Reformed Church ministry, including worship services, was carried out in Dutch government buildings, homes and temporary buildings.
The first Dutch-erected church buildings began to appear in 1706 with the building of the church in Jaffna, known as the Kruys Kerk (Cross Church) because it was built in the design of a Greek Cross - a pattern followed in the design of the Wolfandal and Galle churches later on. The next church building to be completed was in Matara. The most famous of all the DRC churches - the grand edifice in Galle - began construction only in 1752, and was completed in 1755. The majestic Wolfandal Church was dedicated in 1767. The Roman-Dutch Law which continues to hold sway in Sri Lanka as the general law in the country was introduced during the Dutch period of governance.
Dutch architecture continues to be a striking influence added to its contribution to Sri Lankas language, cuisine, art, handicrafts and attire. The beautiful Dutch-influenced furniture of that period, especially those carved from ebony and calamander are some of the most prized furniture today  and some of the most beautiful examples are found in the Christian Reformed Churches in Wolfandal and Galle.
Sri Lanka gained its first printing press when a press was set up in 1736 by the Dutch Governor of the time.
The church worked amongst the poor and the needy in the country, establishing orphanages, schools and the countrys first leprosy asylum in Wattala, among many other social projects and acts of service.

Culprits exposed
The recent bail granted to two convicts of the same crime within hardly three weeks of the sentence, became an hilarious joke in society with some quipping it to be the latest Guinness Book entry.
It is a common phenomenon with convicts very specially those with influence to apply for bail on medical grounds whatever the crime although they are found to be healthy at the time of the sentence and expecting during incarceration pre-conviction VIP medical treatment they were used to with specialists at their beck and call not forgetting overseas medical treatment and check-ups at state expense in the midst of the current day agony the genuine patients are undergoing. Once released we see these convicts and accused travelling around the country as well as internationally and addressing public meetings with vim, vigour and vitality and other social functions.
In the eyes of the general public once could see the bluff that is exposed by these characters.
A good idea would be for Court authorities to call for a 6 months medical report of the accused to be presented to Court when the case is initially called with follow-up instructions to the JMO till the conclusion of the case.

Court dismisses lawsuit seeking order to re-instate former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as SLFP Chairman

A lawsuit filed by two individuals seeking an order to re-instate the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was dismissed by Colombo District Court today.
Colombo District Judge Sujeewa Nissanka upheld the preliminary objections raised by defendants and decided to dismiss the lawsuit in limine.
This lawsuit was filed by two Plaintiffs former Boralesgamuwa Urban Council Chairman K.D. Aruna Priyasantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Election Commission Chairman as defendants.
The SLFP General Secretary through his counsel had raised preliminary objections citing that there is no legal basis to proceed with the case.
In his preliminary objections, the SLFP General Secretary stated that plaintiffs are indirectly challenging the acts of the current President of the republic done in his capacity as chairman of the SLFP.
It is common ground that the chairman of SLFP is the President of the Republic. In terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic has immunity from suit except in an action filed in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution, SLFP General Secretary added.
The defendants further submitted that the District Court has no jurisdiction to file action against Election Commissioner.
The second defendant Anura Priyadarshana has resigned from his position as the General Secretary of SLFP and cannot be named as party defendant in this action. The caption of the action identified third defendant as Sunanda Deshapriya, the Election Commissioner. There is no person who can be reasonably identified as such and in fact no such person used to act as the Commissioner of Election, SLFP General Secretary further added.
The SLFP General Secretary maintained that the plaintiffs are seeking to circumvent the provisions of immunity from suit accorded to the President of the Republic and as such the plaintiffs action is liable to be dismissed in limine.
The plaintiffs alleged that the former SLFP General Secretary Anura Priyadarshana Yapa had sent a letter to the EC on or around January 16, 2015 over the appointment of a new Chairman to the SLFP.
The plaintiffs further alleged that the Executive Committee of the Party without holding a proper committee meeting, had taken the decision to make new appointments to the SLFP leadership.

Presidents Counsel Chandaka Jayasundara with counsel Pulasthi Rupasinghe and Lanka Dharmasiri appeared for SLFP General Secretary. Senior Counsel Nimal Weerakkody appeared for the plaintiffs.

Decisions on expressways taken after careful study: RDA Chairman
The decisions regarding the construction of the expressways, especially whether those expressways should be built on the concrete columns or on the filling lands, were taken after a series of careful studies and researches. They were carried out by engineers, environmentalists, surveyors, scientists and technicians attached to the Road Development Authority, Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, Central Environmental Authority, Land Reclamation Cooperation, and Geological Department, a statement issued by Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal R. Suriyaarachchi said.
The statement added that these officers are being considered as highly reputed government officers and veterans of that particular study fields. They had taken those decisions considering one hundred years of past and future weather patterns, floods, and natural disasters etc.
At present, the Road Development Authority makes arrangements to construct the Central Expressway according to the recommendations especially on concrete columns and filling lands made by the experts. The RDA will implement the most suitable and optimum costs system to build the Central Expressway under the instructions of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, the statement said.
In the meantime, we have noticed that some parties who have no proper understanding or proper knowledge are attempting to mislead the people. Although the correct facts of the Central Expressway were revealed by me with a group of officials at a meeting at Kurunegala, incorrect information is being circulated by those parties, Suriyaarachchi said.
Further, I wish to request any organization or parties to propose a better plan to construct the Central expressway than the plan prepared by the RDA.

From Presidential Secretariat Office to Narahenpita Police :
The Attorney General yesterday informed Court that the CID conducting investigations into the murder of former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen has initiated a comprehensive investigation into the telephone calls received by Narahenpita Police from the phones belonging to the Presidential Secretariat Office on the night of May 17, 2012.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General made this observation when the magisterial inquiry into the murder of Wasim Thajudeen was taken up before the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.
When the case came up before Colombo Additional Magistrate Jeyram Trotsky, the two suspects, former Western Province Senior DIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Champika Perera, were present in court.
They were arrested earlier over their alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder and conspiring to commit the murder. They are currently out on bail.
The CID sought a further date to submit the progress of the investigation into the incident. Further magisterial inquiry fixed for November 8.
On July 27, 2015 the CID submitted to Court that the death of Thajudeen was not an accident but a murder.
While delivering the verdict, former Colombo Additional Magistrate Nishantha Peiris on February 25, 2016 ruled that the death appeared to be a murder and ordered the CID Director to immediately arrest all suspects involved in the incident and produce them before Courts.
Thajudeen was killed, apparently, in a road accident in Colombo on May 17, 2012. The CID had informed court that investigations conducted so far had revealed that Thajudeens teeth had been broken, the bones in the pelvic region also broken and his neck pierced with a sharp instrument prior to his death.
The CID added that muscles in his legs had been cut with a piece of a broken class. Earlier, police maintained that Thajudeen was driving to the airport and had lost control of his car and crashed into the wall of Shalika Grounds at Park Road, Narahenpita, and that his vehicle had exploded within seconds of the crash.

End of a poignant chapter
The courtroom on the third floor of the Jaffna High Court was filled to capacityand then some. Media personnel, attorneys-at-law, and friends and family of both the victim and the accused packed inside the humid room for a verdict all had been waiting to hear since 2015.
Tensions were high throughout the nearly three hours leading up to the reading of the judges decision. Details of the gang-rape and murder of the eighteen-year-old woman were explicated in depth, with no gruesome or gory specific spared. At one point, Vidyas mother, wearing a white and green sari, had to be escorted out after breaking down in tears and nearly passing out.
And when the decisions were announcedthe first and seventh accused released, and the other seven accused sentenced to deaththe reactions across the room were varied. The prosecution looked satisfied, while Defence Counselor Mahinda Jayawardena shook his head in disappointment.
Pockets of the room wore ecstatic expressions on their faces, specifically those who had come in search of justice for Vidya. Her mother, afterward, said she felt justice had been served. Then, as fast as all had gathered in the room that morning, almost everyone filed back out. Yet a few remained, tears streaming down their facesthe mothers, sisters, and wives of the accused, inconsolable, all who felt that it was injustice, not justice, which had been served.
What happened to Vidya
Sivaloganathan Vidya was born on November 25, 1996, at the government hospital in Mankulam. Her family was displaced from Pungudutivu in 1990 due to the civil war and ended up in the Mallavi region in Vanni. In 2010 they were relocated to their native village in Pungudutivu. During the time of her demise, she was studying at Pungudutivu Maha Vidyalayam, for her GCE Advanced Level.
According to her mother, Sarawathi, Vidya went to school at 7.30 am on May 13, 2015. As she failed to return home even at 3 pm, her brother Nishanthan went to school looking for her and where he was told she never arrived. At around 6 pm, Vidyas family reported her missing to the nearest police station at Kurkattuwan but they directed the family to take the case to the Kayts police station.
On May 14, 2015 at 5 am, her brother Nishanthan began searching for his sister. And finally he found his sister brutally murdered. Nishanthan called the police in Kayts at around 7 am and police arrived at 10 am who determined she had also been the victim of a gang rape. Meanwhile on the same day, protests were held in Kilinochchi, Batticaloa, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Mullaitivu and Jaffna urging the police to take immediate action. Three suspects were arrested on that day.
Vidyas funeral was held on May 15, 2015, drawing large crowds. Then on May 18, 2015 five more suspects were arrested, including Swiss Kumar, who was arrested in Colombo. It is alleged a government minister helped in his attempt to escape. Swiss Kumar was alleged to have filmed the gang rape.
All eight suspects were brought to Jaffna Courts on May 20, 2015. There was a huge protest staged in front of the Jaffna High Court and protestors demanded that suspects be handed over to them. Hartals were observed in northern Sri Lanka as a protest against the murder on the following day (21). And several senior police officers involved in the investigation were subsequently transferred and the case was handed over to the Criminal Investigation Department. The Kayts police were criticised for allegedly delaying the prosecution.
At the request of the Attorney General, three High Court judges were appointed on May 23, 2017 and on June 28, 2017 the Trial-at-Bar began. Nine suspects were indicted on 41 counts including abduction, gang rape, murder and being members of an unlawful assembly.
The Trial-at-Bar headed by Vavuniya High Court Judge Balendren Sashi Mahendran included Jaffna High Court Judge Illancheliyan Manicckavasagar and Trincomalee High Court Judge Annalingam Premashankar.
The much-awaitedfinal verdict
The much-awaited verdict on the abduction, rape and murder of Vidya was given on Wednesday (September 27). Seven of the accused, including Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar, were convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya of Punguduthivu in 2015 by the Trial-at-Bar of the Jaffna High Court yesterday.
At the trial, each of the accused was referred to by a number, one through nine. Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa (1st accused), Poobalasingham Jeyakumar alias Ravi (2nd accused), Poobalasingham Navakumar alias Sendil (3rd accused), Mahalingam Shashidaren alias Shashi (4th accused), Pillainandan Chandrakasan alias Chandra (5th accused), Shivaderan Kushange alias Periyathamby (6th accused), Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan (7th accused), Jeyadaran Kokilan alias Kannan(7th accused) and Mahalingam Shashikumar alias Swiss Kumar (8th accused) were accused of abduction, rape and murder of Sivaloganathan Vidya in Punguduthivu in 2015.
The first and the seventh accused, Poobalasingham Indrakumar alias Sinnappa and Palani Rubasingham Kuganathan alias Nishanthan, were released due to lack of adequate evidence to prove their involvement in the murder.
The other seven were sentenced to death.
In addition, the second, third, fifth, sixth and eighth accused were sentenced to 30 years rigorous imprisonment (RI), with a fine of Rs 40,000 each. They were also ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.1 million each to the mother of the victim. The court also ordered to extend their prison term by four months if they fail to pay the fine. These convicts will also have to serve another two years if they fail to pay the compensation.
And the fourth and the ninth accused were sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, each with a fine of Rs 70,000. They were also ordered the payment of Rs 1 million each in compensation to Vidyas parents. Failing to pay the fine, the accused will be further remanded for four months and if they fail to pay the compensation, they will be remanded for another two years.
Judge Illancheliyan further said that MP Vijeyakala Mahenshwaren had gone to the Jaffna police station at 11 pm on May 17 and waited at the station for two hours for the police to release Swiss Kumar when he was arrested. Illancheliyan added that Swiss Kumar was the one main suspect who was alleged to have laid out the whole plan.
He pointed out that MP Maheshwarens involvement in the case was the first step taken by Swiss Kumar to escape from the police custody and added that no legal action was taken against Swiss Kumar at that time.
Judge Illancheliyan claimed that the former Inspector of Police in Kayts who prosecuted had delayed the case, and as a result the CID found it hard to find adequate evidence against the accused. Meanwhile, the CID came in for high praise for their efforts in investigating the case speedily and efficiently.
He commended the CID officers present in Court, IP Nishantha Silva, ASP Sisira Tissera and their team, for their efforts in probing the murder of the rape and murder of the schoolgirl in Jaffna.
Observations of Judge Sashi Mahendren and Judge Ilenchelian
Judge Illancheliyan, delivering the verdict, emphasised that neither the army nor navy was involved in the abduction, rape or murder of Vidya, as alleged by accused and the defence counsel.
If the navy or army was involved there should be evidence in that connection, but we have got nothing. The CID could only find evidence that was connected to the seven accused and that clearly shows that they carried out the rape and murder, the Judge said.
Judge Mahendren said that one former suspect, Uthayasooriyan Surashkaran, turned into the cases eyewitness and produced many important details with regard to the crime.
According to Surashkaran, four of the accused, specifically Ravi, Sendil, Chandra and Periyathambi, each raped Vidya for nearly 10 minutes, videotaped it, and forced a wooden plank inside her mouth to quiet her. Illancheliyan also disclosed Vidyas state when she was finally found by her family: arms tied behind her head with her hair tie, legs each tied to a tree, and underwear gagging her mouth. He reminded the courtroom of the brutal rape, and that Vidya was strangled to death by her school uniform tie.
Judge Illancheliyan further said that Swiss Kumar had entered into an agreement with a Swiss mafia to create a sex tape involving a girl.
He said that one of the prisoners who was imprisoned alongside Swiss Kumar, Mohamed Irfan, told the court that Swiss Kumar had inquired about retrieving a video that was deleted and about creating a sex tape. According to Illancheliyan, Kumar had also told Irfan that he was willing to give Rs 200 Million to IP Nishantha Silva CID who was handling the case to deter him from prosecuting. However, according to Illancheliyan, when Kumar was questioned later, he tried to change the story. Illancheliyan insisted that there is clear evidence to prove that Irfan's narration is true.
While speaking, Illancheliyan called Swiss Kumar the hero of the story as he laid out the accuseds whole plan.
Judge Illancheliyan continued by saying that after the body was found on May 14, three of the accused, Swiss Kumar, Shashi and Kannan, had left to Colombo and had purposefully turned to all the CCTV cameras in an attempt to register their faces as means of an alibi.
He observed that in all the camera footage, it was very clear that it was plan of the accused to prove that they were not in Jaffna during the crime. Yet he said that the CID could not find any footage of them on May 13, the day on which Vidya was murdered, and added that they had also participated in her funeral to avoid suspicion.
Piece by piece, the judges went through all the evidence to prove the involvement of the seven accused who ended up being convicted for the abduction, gang-rape, and murder of Vidya.
Still, Judge Illancheliyan pointed out the difficulties in using DNA as evidence in this case. He explained that the prosecutors took too long to test it and as a result the evidence turned inconclusive.
Defence Counsel Mahinda Jayawardena, speaking to the Daily News after the verdict was given, said he will appeal the judgement in the Supreme Court, emphasising that he does not see this as the final judgement.
Vidya's loved onessatisfied
Vidya's mother, Sarawathy, her family, and friends thanked all the people who fought for justice in Vidya's case.
Holding back tears, Sarawathy said that she was complacent about the verdict and that she finally felt as justice was served for the murder of her daughter.
Vidya's friend N Rahulan said that he was very happy about the verdict and added that he hoped a similar incident should never happen to any girl in future.
We miss her a lot. I pray that her soul rest in peace, he said.
Another friend of Vidya, Thavarasa Thamsika, said that all who knew Vidya were terrified and heartbroken when they first heard what happened to her two years ago. Still, she tried to look at the positive.
We see this verdict as a victory for all women.
Convicts in denial mode
Meanwhile, the accused denied all the charges against them. When they were given a final chance to say something after the verdict was given, the accused said that they were not involved in the abduction, rape or murder of Vidya.
Poobalasingham Jeyakumar, alias Ravi, said he did not do anything.
I have been falsely allegedly accused by the CID for committing the murder. I have three children and a family. I never did this, he said.
Poobalasingham Navakumar, alias Sendil, said that he has no connection to this rape and murder.
Why should I do it I don't have or did not have any motif to do such a crime. I am speaking the truth, the CID had twisted the story for some reason, he said.
Mahalingam Shashidaren, alias Shashi, said that he was in Colombo on May 13, 2015, but his boss and friends in Colombo are reluctant to back this statement up.
My mother died after I got arrested. I have a family too and I did not do this, he said.
Pillainandan Chandrakasan, alias Chandra, said that he has two children and requested the judge to release him.
I never committed this crime. The CID had created tall stories against us. Neither we nor Vidya got justice in this case. Only Vidya's mother spoke truth in the court all the others were threatened by the CID to collect evidence against us, he said.
Shivaderan Kushange, alias Periyathamby, said he has five sisters and that did not even look at Vidya before she was murdered.
I was not involved in committing the murder as well. I am innocent. The real criminals who committed the crime are out. God will take care of everything, he said.
Jeyadaran Kokilan alias Kannan said he was in Colombo when the murder happened.
The charges put on me are false. I have not got anything else to say other than the truth that I was not involved, he said. Mahalingam Shashikumar, alias Swiss Kumar, said none of the accused was part of the crime, even though he himself was alleged to have planned the whole thing. I did not do it. The CID has changed the story and now trying to put the blame on us. he said.

Enter Intruder
The dramatists of the British School in Colombo are a versatile group of thespians. Their adaptability has enabled them to stage Pygmalion which My Fair Lady was based on and now they are preparing for a supernatural play called The Intruder. Dramatic Moves features these resilient students whose outstanding talent and grasp of the fundamentals of drama have enabled them to deliver some memorable performances.
At the present we are auditioning for Anything Goes, which is the Cole Porter musical. We are going to stage it next year in March 22, 23 and 24. We are going through the auditioning process for that, and then once we establish the cast we will go into rehearsals and the crew will start to work. That will be a big event with 50 plus cast, said The British School in Colombo, Head of Drama, Shane Meiklejohn.
The Intruder is a bit of a dark drama that requires considerable skill. And the dramatists of BSC are certainly not lacking in skill. Indeed the fact that they can switch from a play like Pygmalion to The Intruder is proof of their talent as both plays deal with different themes.
We have a team of students who will present the mysterious symbolist play, The Intruder by the nineteenth century Belgian playwright Maurice Maeterlinck for entry in the CBB Drama Competition in October. The Intruder is also for their O/Ls. Last year we staged Pygmalion which was what they based my Fair Lady on. We decided to go with the actual script of Pygmalion and the original text, but we incorporated some song and dance in that. So that was a lot of fun, Meiklejohn said.
The dramatists of BSC certainly have good breeding. There inter-house competition is very competitive. There is also our inter-house drama competition between all the houses which is very exciting. It will take part in late October. They have to formulate a team of around 15 students from a cross section from year seven all the way up to year 13. They have to incorporate some movement into it as well as dialogue and they should be specific to the theme and they need to use some music. So they have to be fairly creative and develop something original. So we try to bring in some industry professionals and some of the performing arts teachers here to be the judges for it, Meiklejohn explained.
Because of drama any student can build up his or her self esteem and be able to express themselves. One of the most important and vital qualities that a person can possess is self- expression. Putting your thoughts into the correct words, articulation, the ability to meaningfully communicate and it also teaches them skills in vocal and physical expressions which are very useful in public speaking and presentation. It is the whole idea of ensemble  working together in theater is very important.
When you have these creative goals together there is a lot of sharing of ideas and sharing of skills which is wonderful. The creative side I must emphasize on because we teach them everything from technical stuff such as lighting and sound to artistic design on the stage as well as acting theories and styles. The students learn about how it touches on culture and all the arts integrated. You learn skills like quick thinking and timing and agility and creativity and spontaneity. It is a good way for team building and such skills. You also learn improvisation. The students are very creative and switched on about a lot of things in the world. They are very interested in developing character and story- telling and evoking story through acting, Meiklejohn said.
Good grounding
Findlay Tattersall, year 11 who plays Oliver, the Uncle in The Intruder, spoke how fascinating the play The Intruder is. Supernatural films have always had a spellbinding effect on the human psyche.
The play that we are doing here is in an eerie setting and it is in the late 90s. Superstition of ghosts and the supernatural was very prevalent during that time. Some of the characters in the play are a little creeped out and even some of the characters are not willing to admit that they are a little freaked out! My character is Oliver who plays the role of the stubborn uncle. He is quite nice and friendly but sometimes he is a little bit stubborn, said Tattersall.
The play itself kind of gets you ready for what is to happen, it kind of sets things in place. You dont know what is going to happen yet. You sort of anticipate what is going to happen. It is very interesting and I rather enjoy it.
Practices have been going on well. We started last year. Everyone is very enthusiastic. So we have seen each other over the holidays. We see how everything is built step by step. And we get to where we are now because now we are having costumes and make up. So it is all a really interesting experience, said Tattersall.
BSC Drama is perfect because of the good grounding it gives its students in drama. BSC teaches their students life lessons. The productions were all fundamentals because they all taught these students valuable lessons.
Each and every single one makes you ready. I want to do acting as a career in life. So doing drama at BSC is the best chance of doing what I want to do in the future. Certain group work you need to learn because these people are people I dont normally work with, which is nice because that prepares you for what comes later in life. So you learn about different acting styles. Everyone helps each other. And that is another BSC attribute. We are all getting ready for the production itself. If someone is anxious or nervous so we give him or her a nudge which helps. So we get through. If you are the creative type I would say Drama is the thing because it makes you familiar with so many disciplines like acting, directing, writing screen plays or handling the lights. It gives you a confidence boost, explained Tattersall.
A major theme
Udara Kularatne, year 11 who plays the Grandmother in The Intruder, spoke of death as a major theme. Death in any play is a complicated issue to deal with and many cultures represent death in so many ways.
I play the blind grandmother in the Intruder. It is a play set in the late 90s. It is basically about the supernatural element. Death is a major theme. It is how death comes and takes people away. And me, being the blind grandmother I can sense it because of my wisdom and maybe because of how old I am, said Kularatne.
Thorough research is the best method to mastering your character. You need to have a feel for your character.
I am better at playing younger characters than older characters. So by playing the blind grandmother I am trying to face the challenge. To get into the skin of a character you can watch youtube videos such as old people acting in movies. So you observe those people. And you can even read upon blindness. How a blind person would feel. Drama is not as easy as some people think. Do it if you like to do it. If you like being on stage and speaking to big audiences and if you like acting and the written element. Then do it. There is an element of fun as well, said Kularatne.
Very differentideas
Liana Lawrence, year 11 plays Ursula, the grand daughter in The Intruder felt that the time gap has to be dealt with when trying to perfect her role.
To get into the skin of my character I have to imagine myself in the situation and try and feel how this young girl would feel and her mindset, because things were different in that era. She is young and innocent. It is very different to modern young girls. So I had to do quite a lot of research into it to get into that personality. She is the one the grand mother has most trust in. Me and the grandmother had to work on our personal relationship as well to show that in the play such as how we trust each other. Otherwise it would not be realistic at all, said Lawrence.
The most interesting thing about life is that so many people respond differently to the same situation. Different people have very different ideas about how to respond to a similar experience.
In drama I get to work with so many different individuals and find out how people think about similar situations. Quite a few of us got together through our holidays and work through our lines and getting into the mood and emotions of the characters. When I acted in Pygmalion it was fun! I got to know a lot of people. The plot of Pygmalion was about a street girl who had been brought up in the poor areas of London and she is basically taken into care by a philosopher and he taught her how to act like a lady. He took her from a poor girl selling flowers on the streets into something more refined, explained Lawrence.
Stage fright
Theekshana Nawinne, year 11 plays Paul, the Father in The Intruder stated that when he does something he gives it 100 percent. He is very serious about what he wants to do in life.
There are humorous characters on stage and I have seen them in society. People are not exactly the same but somewhere along those lines. I have not performed Shakespearean plays but I have studied a lot of them. My favorite play probably is Pygmalion. It was very thrilling. In a very serious play I was like the comic relief, said Nawinne.
Every single drama I have done is pretty much unforgettable says Nawinne stressing that when he does something he puts his entire soul into it. To him each play is different and it is this uniqueness that appeals to him. It is what makes his effort worthwhile.
Through drama I have learnt to be a very professional speaker. It has helped me with my public speaking. In drama you have to speak to large audiences. Drama is a very good way of expressing yourself. Any actor has stage fright. In my first performance I was a little bit shaky and I was very anxious. Once you get used to acting little by little you get better. Also my friends helped me a lot, said Nawinne
For a good production you need to have a dedicated cast. You need a very good director. There are assistant directors and choreographers. All those people come together. When they put in their 100 percent you have an amazing play. It requires a lot of hard work, dedication and effort.

Essential items sold at reduced prices at Lanka Sathosa outlets from today
Rice and other essential food items will be sold at reduced prices at islandwide Lanka Sathosa outlets from today in a bid to bring down the cost of living, Lanka Sathosa Chairman T.M.K.B. Tennakoon said.
Addressing a press conference at the CWE in Colombo yesterday, the Lanka Sathosa Chairman said the prices of eight rice varieties have been brought down with effect from midnight yesterday as per a decision taken at the Cost of Living Cabinet Sub Committee meeting headed by President Maithripala Sirisena on Wednesday night.
He said rice, sprats, big onions, local potatoes, canned fish, milk powder, sugar, dhal and wheat flour would be sold at reduced prices, while assuring that good quality stocks of these items would be available without any shortage in Sathosa outlets across the country.
He said Sathosa could negotiate with about 30 companies to give special discounts to grocery items such as soap, tea powder, jam and soft drinks from next week.
As per the new prices effective from today, a kilo gram of White Nadu has been reduced by Rs 3 from Rs 77-74, White Kekulu by Rs 3 from Rs 68-65, Samba by Rs 5 from Rs 89-84, Red Kekulu by Rs 2 from Rs 77-75, Red Nadu by Rs 3 from 83-80, White Kekulu Samba by Rs 4 from Rs 94-90, Red Kekulu Samba by Rs 2 from Rs 90-88 and an imported broken rice variety by Rs 5 from 65-60.
Most of these rates are lower than the controlled prices we introduced in August, he added.
He said one KG of sprats (imported from Thailand) has been reduced from Rs 539-525.
We are selling 1kg of big onions at Rs 125, local potatoes at Rs 130, canned fish (400g) at Rs 130, milk powder (400g packet) at Rs 305, sugar at Rs 107, dhal at Rs 152 and what flour at Rs 86. These prices are much lower compared to their current prices in Super markets.
When we drop the prices we believe the other super market chains will also follow suit, he said.
The Chairman said the President instructed the Coconut Development Board to deploy mobile units to distribute coconut at reasonable prices in the main cities.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg rejects Trump bias claims
The US president accused the social network of collusion on Twitter, branding it anti-Trump.
He made the same claim against the New York Times and the Washington Post. Facebook will shortly hand over 3,000 political adverts to congressional investigators probing alleged Russian meddling in the US election.
The site believes the ads were probably purchased by Russian entities during and after the 2016 presidential contest.
Facebook, Twitter and Google have been asked to testify before the US Senate Intelligence Committee on 1 November about the allegations of Russian interference.
Facebook and Google have confirmed they have received invitations to attend the committee hearing, but none of the social media giants have yet said they will be present.
Mark Zuckerberg has made it clear in the past that he doesn't like Donald Trump - or at least, his policies.
This statement shows frustration, I think. Not just with the president, but at the atmosphere swirling around Facebook at the moment - commentary that is painting it as a burden on the electoral process, and maybe even on society as a whole.
He's trying to show all the good - as he sees it - that Facebook has done.
He feels hard done by. And as a man obsessed by data and metrics, he's probably looking at the problem of Russian-backed fake news ads and seeing it as a minuscule part of all the election goings-on on his network of 2 billion people. But it's not the scale that's the issue here - but his immature refusal to face up to the public's concerns. It was less cover up, more can't-be-bothered.

Fort, Galle Face to be made into major shopping destination
The Government is strongly considering converting the Colombo Fort and Galle Face areas to a shoping destination as the first step of making Sri Lanka a popular shopping destination in the region, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
He made this observation at the launching ceremony of the official Website and Logo of the first Colombo International Shopping Festival scheduled to be held across the country from October 1 to 15.
Minister Amaratunga said Sri Lanka has long recognised the importance of shopping to help drive the growth of the countrys tourism sector.
Sri Lankas most popular shops are situated in different places. If you look at Singapore or any other developed country, all the main shops are in one street. So the Government is deeply concentrating on doing same in the Colombo Fort and Galle Face area, the Minister said.
The Whiteaway building has been given to a company and its upper floor will be utilised for a boutique hotel while the ground floor allocated for retail shops. The ground floor of Shangri-La Hotel at Galle Face will also be utilised for retail shops. The Port City once completed will have a large area set aside for this type of shopping, the Minister said.
Maybe in a year or two, the tourists who come to Sri Lanka who occupy the Five Star hotels will be able to walk down along the streets and do their side shopping, the Minister predicted.
He said the Prime Minister was thinking on those lines and he would be able to accomplish this idea of making Colombo a shopping hub. The Colombo International Shopping Festival is organised by the Sri Lanka Retailers Association in collaboration with the Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry.
Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry Secretray Esala Weerakoon, Tourism Promotion Bureau Chairman Udaya Nanayakkara, SriLankan Airlines CEO Suren Ratwatte, Sri Lanka Retailers Association Chairman Hussain Sidique and and other distinguished guests participated.

GMOA calls to present govt stand on SAITM
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to the President requesting him to order the Attorney General to present the Government stance on SAITM to the Supreme Court as agreed, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said although it was agreed to present the Government stand on SAITM (declared on April 7) to the Supreme Court, the official lawyer from the Attorney General's Department did not do it yesterday and did the opposite.
This lawyer believes that the facts that are relevant and important for the people's rights do not include in the Supreme Court case and whatever state decisions do not matter or relevant for the Supreme Court case, Dr. Aluthge said.
This lawyer should present April 7 Government's declaration (stand on SAITM) to the Supreme Court immediately and the GMOA asked the President to intervene and get it done through the Attorney General's Department, Dr. Aluthge added.

Govt. service under intense scrutiny after RTI - Mangala
As the government celebrated its second Right to Information (RTI) day this year, Mass Media and Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera believes that a more watchful public will lead the way to an efficient government service.
Experience around the world has shown that when the people have information and they are watching, the public service is forced to perform,Minister Samaraweera said. Addressing a workshop organised by the Department of Government Information at Global Towers, Wellawatte yesterday, the Minister chose to quote economist Joseph Stiglitz and his theory of asymmetric information to highlight the need to have the RTI, Prof Stiglitz says that due to the unusual access public officials have to information, which is not otherwise available to the general public, officials are able to impose policies on the people suited to serve only themselves and not that which is needed by the people, he explained.
When the system of access to and distribution of information is improved, one can minimise the misuse of information by public officials, he added.
The Minister dismissed allegations that the RTI would simply discourage public officials from carrying out their work due to the fear of censure.
These arguments have been put forward by those who dont want this implemented. We have continuously trained government officials and spoken to them about how they can do their job without breaching any laws and serve the people more efficiently, he said.
They have also appointed 3000 Information Officers to government institutions, The Minister said.
The RTI Act which came into force in June of 2016 has since helped many discover information previously not available. The Minister pointed out that the mother of Roshen Chanaka who was murdered in a protest 2011, was able to get the report on an inquiry because of the RTI.
The report was complete in 2011 and handed over to the President at the time but it was not made public until now, said Samaraweera. The Minister who stressed that the RTI was one election promise the government has kept, said they would work to further strengthen it through their Vision 2025.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the Government plans to attract US$ 34 billion (Rs. 600 billion plus) worth of Foreign Direct Investments (FDIs) during the next 23 years to boost economic growth in the country.

Grace Darling..!
I dont know whether it was due to the fact that my fathers youngest sisters name was Grace that he loved telling me the story of Grace Darling. I remembered the story today, as I thought of the many people who tell me very vehemently that no one individual can make things change in this world.
I disagree with them totally, and for them will I narrate my dads favourite story.
Years ago, one cold winter evening, a storm bore down upon a little fishing village, somewhere off the west coast of England. Suddenly, through the sounds of the howling wind, the villagers heard the eerie sound of men crying for help. They peered through the rain and the waves and in the distance, they saw a ship that was wrecked after being grounded and smashed by rocks.
The men from the sailing ship were crying out in terror and anguish as they faced imminent death. The fishing folk in the little village looked at the stranded sailors and shook their heads sadly. They knew it was impossible to venture out to sea again. Their hearts went out to the poor sailors, but again they shook their heads in helplessness.
But one young girl in their midst who heard the cries and felt the terror of the stranded men looked at the others and something stirred within her.
Help them, she shouted running from one villager to another. They will die if we dont help them. Nobody moved, not her father, nor her brothers not any of the men who she knew so well.
Grace, they told her, theres nothing we can do.
But Grace on seeing the resolute faces, jumped into one of the small boats and before the men could stop her, rowed into the storm towards the shipwreck. The villagers watched in horror as the boat tossed from side to side, and as a small, frail but determined girl guided it to the deathly spot.
Her brother cried, her mother wept, her father cursed, till they saw the little craft reach the wretched men. The men, stranded and lost, jumped into the little boat.
She could take only a few, but when she looked round, she saw all the boats on the shore make their way, to pick up the rest of them.
All the men were rescued, and Grace became a heroine that night and is remembered to this day.
A lovely story and so well can I hear my fathers voice as he continued after the tale and looking into my wide little boy eyes would say, Bob, the truth, we need to know, is that even one person can make things happen. Also Bob when this one person starts making things happen others who have held back will follow. But that one person has to lead.
We need more Grace Darlings today than ever before..!

## Title: Has the UN failed Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims
## Supertitle:

Has the UN failed Myanmar's Rohingya Muslims

The UN leadership in Myanmar tried to stop the Rohingya rights issue being raised with the government, sources in the UN and aid community told the BBC.
One former UN official said the head of the UN in Myanmar (Burma) tried to prevent human rights advocates from visiting sensitive Rohingya areas.
More than 500,000 Rohingya havefled an offensive by the military, with many now sheltering in camps in Bangladesh.
The UN in Myanmar "strongly disagreed" with the BBC findings.
In the month since Rohingya Muslims began flowing into Bangladesh, the UN has been at the forefront of the response. It has delivered aid and made robust statements condemning the Burmese authorities.
But sources within the UN and the aid community both in Myanmar and outside have told the BBC that, in the four years before the current crisis, the head of the United Nations Country Team (UNCT), a Canadian called Renata Lok-Dessallien:
Tried to stop human rights activists travelling to Rohingya areas
Attempted to shut down public advocacy on the subject
Isolated staff who tried to warn that ethnic cleansing might be on the way.
One aid worker, Caroline Vandenabeele, had seen the warning signs before. She worked in Rwanda in the run-up to the genocide in late 1993 and early 1994 and says when she first arrived in Myanmar she noticed worrying similarities.
"I was with a group of expats and Burmese business people talking about Rakhine and Rohingya and one of the Burmese people just said 'we should kill them all as if they are just dogs'. For me, this level of dehumanisation of humans is one sign that you have reached a level of acceptance in society that this is normal."
For more than a year I have been corresponding with Vandenabeele, who has served in conflict areas such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Rwanda and Nepal, where she is now based and where we recently met.
Between 2013 and 2015 she had a crucial job in the UNCT in Myanmar. She was head of office for what is known as the resident co-ordinator, the top UN official in the country, currently Dessallien.
The job gave Vandenabeele a front-row seat as the UN grappled with how to respond to rising tensions in Rakhine state.
Back in 2012, clashes between Rohingya Muslims and Rakhine Buddhists left more than 100 dead and more than 100,000 Rohingya Muslims in camps around the state capital, Sittwe.
Since then, there have been periodic flare-ups and, in the past year, the emergence of a Rohingya militant group. Attempts to deliver aid to the Rohingya have been complicated by Rakhine Buddhists who resent the supply of aid for the Rohingya, at times blocking it and even attacking aid vehicles.
It presented a complex emergency for the UN and aid agencies, who needed the co-operation of the government and the Buddhist community to get basic aid to the Rohingya.
At the same time they knew that speaking up about the human rights and statelessness of the Rohingya would upset many Buddhists.
So the decision was made to focus on a long-term strategy. The UN and the international community prioritised long-term development in Rakhine in the hope that eventually increased prosperity would lead to reduced tensions between the Rohingya and the Buddhists.
For UN staff it meant that publicly talking about the Rohingya became almost taboo. Many UN press releases about Rakhine avoided using the word completely. The Burmese government does not even use the word Rohingya or recognise them as a distinct group, preferring to call them "Bengalis".
During my years reporting from Myanmar, very few UN staff were willing to speak frankly on the record about the Rohingya. Now an investigation into the internal workings of the UN in Myanmar has revealed that even behind closed doors the Rohingyas' problems were put to one side.

Where have the Rohingya fled to
Multiple sources in Myanmar's aid community have told the BBC that at high-level UN meetings in Myanmar any question of asking the Burmese authorities to respect the Rohingyas' human rights became almost impossible.
Vandenabeele said it soon became clear to everyone that raising the Rohingyas' problems, or warning of ethnic cleansing in senior UN meetings, was simply not acceptable.
"Well you could do it but it had consequences," she said. "And it had negative consequences, like you were no longer invited to meetings and your travel authorisations were not cleared. Other staff were taken off jobs - and being humiliated in meetings. An atmosphere was created that talking about these issues was simply not on."
Repeat offenders, like the head of the UN's Office for the Co-ordination for Humanitarian Assistance (UNOCHA) were deliberately excluded from discussions.
Vandenabeele told me she was often instructed to find out when the UNOCHA representative was out of town so meetings could be held at those times. The head of UNOCHA declined to speak to the BBC but it has been confirmed by several other UN sources inside Myanmar.
Vandenabeele said she was labelled a troublemaker and frozen out of her job for repeatedly warning about the possibility of Rohingya ethnic cleansing. This version of events has not been challenged by the UN.
Attempts to restrict those talking about the Rohingya extended to UN officials visiting Myanmar. Tomas Quintana is now the UN special rapporteur for human rights in North Korea but for six years, until 2014, held that same role for Myanmar.
Speaking from Argentina, he told me about being met at Yangon airport by Dessallien.
"I received this advice from her - saying you should not go to northern Rakhine state - please don't go there. So I asked why and there was not an answer in any respect, there was just the stance of not trying to bring trouble with the authorities, basically," he said.
"This is just one story, but it demonstrates what was the strategy of the UN Country Team in regards to the issue of the Rohingya."
Quintana still went to northern Rakhine but said Dessallien "disassociated" herself from his mission and he didn't see her again.
One senior UN staffer told me: "We've been pandering to the Rakhine community at the expense of the Rohingya.
"The government knows how to use us and to manipulate us and they keep on doing it - we never learn. And we can never stand up to them because we can't upset the government."
The UN's priorities in Rakhine were examined in a report commissioned by the UN in 2015 entitled "Slippery Slope: Helping Victims or Supporting Systems of Abuse".
Leaked to the BBC, it is damning of the UNCT approach.
"The UNCT strategy with respect to human rights focuses too heavily on the over-simplified hope that development investment itself will reduce tensions, failing to take into account that investing in a discriminatory structure run by discriminatory state actors is more likely to reinforce discrimination than change it."
There have been other documents with similar conclusions. With Antnio Guterres as the new secretary general in New York, a former senior member of the UN was asked to write a memo for his team in April.
Titled "Repositioning the UN" the two-page document was damning in its assessment, calling the UN in Myanmar "glaringly dysfunctional".
In the weeks that followed the memo,the UN confirmed that Ms Dessallien was being "rotated"but stressed it was nothing to do with her performance. Three months on Dessallien is still the UN's top official there after the Burmese government rejected her proposed successor.
"She has a fair view and is not biased," Shwe Mann, a former senior general and close ally of Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, told me. "Whoever is biased towards the Rohingyas, they won't like her and they will criticise her."
Dessallien declined to give an interview to the BBC to respond to this article.
The UN in Myanmar said its approach was to be "fully inclusive" and ensure the participation of all relevant experts.
"We strongly disagree with the accusations that the resident co-ordinator 'prevented' internal discussions. The resident co-ordinator regularly convenes all UN agencies in Myanmar to discuss how to support peace and security, human rights, development and humanitarian assistance in Rakhine state," a statement from a UN spokesperson in Yangon said.
On Tomas Quintana's visits to Rakhine, the spokesperson said Dessallien had "provided full support" in terms of personnel, logistics and security.
Ten ambassadors, including from Britain and the United States, wrote unsolicited emails to the BBC when they heard we were working on this report, expressing their support for Dessallien.
There are those who see similarities between the UN's much-criticised role in Sri Lanka and what has happened in Myanmar. Charles Petrie wrote a damning report into the UN and Sri Lanka, and also served as the UN's top official in Myanmar (before being expelled in 2007).
He said the UN's response to the Rohingya over the past few years had been confused and that Ms Dessallien hadn't been given the mandate to bring all of the key areas together.
"I think the key lesson for Myanmar from Sri Lanka is the lack of a focal point. A senior level focal point addressing the situation in Myanmar in its totality - the political, the human rights, the humanitarian and the development. It remains diffuse. And that means over the last few years there have been almost competing agendas."
So might a different approach from the UN and the international community have averted the humanitarian disaster we are seeing now It's hard to see how it might have deterred the Burmese army's massive response following the 25 August Rohingya militant attack.
Vandenabeele said she at least believed an early warning system she proposed might have provided some indications of what was about to unfold.
"It's hard to say which action would have been able to prevent this," she told me. "But what I know for sure is that the way it was done was never going to prevent it. The way it was done was simply ignoring the issue."
Quintana said he wished the international community had pushed harder for some sort of transitional justice system as part of the move to a hybrid democratic government.
One source said the UN now appeared to be preparing itself for an inquiry into its response to Rakhine, and this could be similar to the inquiry that came after the controversial end to Sri Lanka's civil war - and which found it wanting.

Health Education Bureau re-launched as Health Promotion Bureau
The former Health Education Bureau (HEB) which functioned under the purview of the Health Ministry was re-launched yesterday as the Health Promotion Bureau to widen its coverage.
The institution was re-launched by the acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J. M. W. Jayasundara Bandara in the presence of staff members, journalists, Health Ministry officials and invitees. The objective is to make the population healthier. Addressing the gathering after opening the Bureau, Dr. Bandara said with the assistance extended by media institutions, dengue reduced by 70 percent within four weeks. It was previously aimed to reduce dengue by 50 percent within four weeks.
We should be ready to prevent Super Malaria entering Sri Lanka and to face it if it enters the country, he said.
We should give what is demanded by the people when it comes to health information. It is useless to offer what we know to them, he said. The former Health Education Bureau was established in 1972. The Health Promotion Bureau is the centre of excellence in Sri Lanka for health education, health promotion and publicity of health information. Empowering and mobilizing communities for the improvement of life through health promotion principles is the main achievement gained for the last few decades, Dr. Bandara said.

Information Technology Agreement  accession to contribute 0.96% to GDP
International Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF), estimates that Information Technology Agreement (ITA) accession would contribute to Sri Lankas GDP by 0.96 percent, larger than would otherwise be the case 10 years post-accession, with the ITA-attributable increase in GDP output reaching $1.4 billion.
In terms of tax impact, ITIF estimates that, in the tenth year post accession, Sri Lanka would recover 47 percent of tariff revenue forgone as a result of ITA accession, with $87 million in tariff income forgone offset by $27 million in newly generated income tax revenue and $14 million from
new goods and services (GSA) tax receipts.
But a difference of just over $40 million in tariff receipts is a small price to pay for the expanded economic and employment growth ITA accession would be poised to engender over that 10-year period.
ITIF estimates Sri Lankas imports of ITA-covered ICT products were just under $20 billion for 2014, with a realized average tariff rate of 4 percent.
This essentially mean Sri Lankas ICT/BPO sector pays 4 percent more than necessary for critical ICT inputs, and Sri Lankas ICT/BPO enterprises have to factor this cost into the prices they charge their clients.
This means they have to raise their prices as much as 4 percent, a considerable amount given the razor-thin margins in the fiercely competitive global ICT/BPO sector.
Sri Lankas ICT/business-process outsourcing sector represents one of the countrys most important and fastest-growing economic sectors.
The sector has grown by more than 120 percent over the past five years, reaching $900 million in exports in 2016 while supporting over 85,000 jobs,and accounting for 3.4 percent of the countrys current account receipts.
The sector reports impressive economic margins and estimates 95 percent value addition. By 2022, SLASSCOM, the Sri Lanka Association of Software and Services, estimates the countrys ICT/business-process outsourcing sector will grow to $5 billion in revenues, support 200,000 direct jobs, and seed over 1,000 start-up enterprises.
Sri Lankas ICT/BPO sector has been internationally recognized, named by the United Kingdoms National Outsourcing Association as the Offshoring Destination of the Year in 2014 and ranking 16th according to the AT Kearney Global Services Location Index.
As Sri Lanka has an extremely limited ICT production sector, its ICT services/BPO sector needs to import low-cost, best-of-breed ICT equipment such as computers, servers, and mobile devices to maintain a globally competitive sector.

IPM President Prof. Ajantha Speaks  at NIPM's Annual HR Conference
IPM Sri Lanka President Prof. Ajantha Dharmasiri was invited as a distinguished guest and speaker at India's Annual National HR Conference NATCON 2107 held in Chennai, India in September.
The theme of the event which was organized by the National Institute of Personnel Management (NIPM) of India was HR Positioning in Current Disruptive Business Environment. In line with this theme, Prof. Dharmasiri shared his knowledge and expertise on the local and global aspects of Engaging Employees in a Disruptive Environment. An 8-member delegation comprising members of IPM accompanied Prof. Dharmasiri as part of the bilateral exchange and cooperation programme that exists between IPM Sri Lanka and NIPM, India.
IPM Sri Lanka has been successful in establishing an excellent relationship with its counterpart in India for mutual benefit. The bilateral exchange and cooperation programme between IPM Sri Lanka and NIPM India helps to provide valuable exposure while opening up avenues and opportunities for knowledge sharing and networking for members of both institutes.
Sharing of knowledge, expertise and experiences between two regional think tanks would no doubt add value to local knowledge in driving vital policy actions and decisions in better engaging employees in a disruptive social and business environment said Prof. Dharmasiri.
Describing employee engagement as an umbrella term encompassing many related concepts, Prof. Dharmasiri emphasized the need for employee engagement for organizational success while drawing upon global trends which reveal the need for it. Disruptive technologies drive digital initiatives in diverse fields and people centric human resource management functions need to embrace the resultant disruptive change by adapting strategies or by innovating new ones so as to ensure that people are empowered to be fast, focused and flexible in order to take on-the-spot decisions based on situational realities.
Employee engagement should by no means confine the employees to the workplace, depriving them of their family and social obligations. In research literature, higher job security, increased social support and the existence of family friendly policies have been shown to reduce the incidence of work-family conflict. Whilst striving for employee engagement, ensuring a proper balancing of other aspects needs careful consideration he added.
He further stated that NATCON 2017 was a significant thought sharing event on disruption and its associated implications to HR.

July export earnings grow 13.9% yoy to US$ 1,016 mn
Sri Lankas external sector continued to improve with increased exports and inflows to the financial account.
However, the trade deficit widened in July 2017 compared to the corresponding month of 2016 due to higher import expenditure amid the increase in export earnings. Tourist earnings declined marginally in July while workers remittances increased, reversing its declining trend observed in the last four months.
Inflows to the financial account continued to strengthen with net inflows to the government securities market, long term loans to the government, receipt of the third tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as continued portfolio investment inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
Continuing the upward trend observed since March 2017, earnings from exports increased in July 2017 surpassing the US $ 1 billion mark for the second time during the year. Accordingly, earnings from exports at US dollars 1,016 million in July 2017 registered a year-on-year growth of 13.9%.
Earnings from industrial exports grew by 11.6% (year-on-year) to US $ 757 million in July 2017, led by increased exports of textiles and garments. Indicating a reversal of negative growth experienced in the previous two months, export earnings from textiles and garments increased by 9.6% (year-on-year) to US $ 467 million compared to July 2016, registering the highest monthly value recorded so far during the year. Garment exports to the EU market increased by 10.6 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 188 million in July 2017 signaling the positive impact of the restoration of the GSP+ facility in May 2017. During the month, garment exports to the USA and non-traditional markets also grew by 7.9% and 6.5% (year-on-year), respectively. Meanwhile, export earnings from food, beverages and tobacco increased significantly by 46.8 %( year-on-year) to US $ 34 million.
Earnings from agricultural exports increased substantially by 21.8% (year-on-year) to US$ 253 million in July 2017 mainly due to notable performance recorded in tea exports.
In addition, earnings from seafood exports increased considerably by 42.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 20 million in July. Meanwhile, export earnings from spices increased by 14.0 per cent (year-on-year) during the month, reflecting higher volumes in almost all sub categories.
On a cumulative basis, earnings from exports grew by 6.5 per cent (year-on-year) to US dollars 6,413 million during the first seven months of 2017 due to increased earnings received from exports of tea, transport equipment, petroleum products, spices and seafood.
During the first seven month of 2017, the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy were the leading markets for merchandise exports of Sri Lanka accounting for about 50 per cent of total exports.

Karunaratne leads Sri Lanka fightback in first Test
Abu Dhabi: Opener Dimuth Karunaratne fell seven runs short of a deserved century as he anchored Sri Lankas fightback on the opening day of the first Test against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi on Thursday.
The left-hander was run out for 93 but helped his team recover from a precarious 61-3 to reach 227-4 at close after Sri Lanka won the toss and batted on a greenish Sheikh Zayed Stadium pitch.
Karunaratne added an invaluable 100-run partnership with skipper Dinesh Chandimal, who was 60 not out at stumps, as Pakistan failed to break through with the second new ball.
Niroshan Dickwella was unbeaten on 42, having added 66 runs for the unbroken fifth-wicket stand alongside his captain.
Chandimal was given leg before to Yasir Shah on 42, a decision which was overturned on review. His innings has included six boundaries while Dickwella hit five fours and a six during his aggressive knock.
Shah returned figures of 2-59 but didnt get much turn from the pitch while seamer Hasan Ali took 1-58.
It was Karunaratnes knock that brought Sri Lanka back into it in the last two sessions. He batted for four hours and 40 minutes during an obdurate stay at the crease, recording his fourth half-century against Pakistan and sixth overall.
But he was run out in the last session as he attempted a quick single only to be left stranded after Chandimal at the non-strikers end sent him back.
Pakistan had the advantage in the first session with leg-spinner Shah taking two wickets, dismissing left-hander Lahiru Thirimanne for his 150th Test wicket.
Shah matched fellow countryman Waqar Younis as the joint second fastest to 150 wickets -- both achieving the milestone in their 27th Test.
Australias Sydney Barnes holds the record after reaching the landmark in just 24 Tests.
At the start, Karunaratne had a solid opening stand of 34 with Kaushal Silva before Hasan provided Pakistan with the breakthrough.
Hasan bowled Silva for 12 as the batsman played on to an inswinging delivery.
Shah then had Thirimanne trapped leg before for a duck and Kusal Mendis caught behind for 10 to leave Sri Lanka reeling.
The Test is Pakistans first since the retirement of legendary batsman Younis Khan and their most successful Test skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq.
Pakistan handed a Test cap to batsman Haris Sohail, while Sri Lanka went into the game with three spinners and two seamers.
English umpire Ian Gould became an early morning casualty as the 60-year-old succumbed to an upset stomach and was replaced by Richard Kettleborough, originally the television umpire. AFP

MDMK protests outside Chennai Deputy High Commission office
MDMK cadres on Wednesday laid siege to the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission office in Chennai, claiming that their leader Vaiko was threatened at the UN Council.
MDMK leader Vaiko has been attending the UN Council for the past 3 days, speaking in favour of Sri Lankan Tamil nationals and alleging that the government of Sri Lanka has been discriminating against the Tamil community. Vaiko, in his speech at the UN council, protested against the Lankan government for the atrocities being committed against Tamils living in Sri Lanka. Vaiko has stood firm on his stance, holding the Sri Lankan government responsible for the death of lakhs of Lankan Tamils in 2009 and the deteriorating state of livelihood of those remaining.
What happened after Vaiko's speech at UN Council
Two days ago, a video taken inside the UN Council was released where Vaiko alleged that after he had finished a speech session, a Lankan national confronted him asking how he could speak in such a scathingly critical way about Sri Lanka. Vaiko, on his part, said that he only brought to the fore the atrocities that were being faced by the Lankan Tamils. Later, six other nationals, whom Vaiko claimed to be soldiers or war commanders, threatened him to not speak in such a manner.
It was on hearing about this incident that the MDMK cadres attempted to lay siege to the Sri Lankan Deputy High Commission in Chennai.
Party leader Mallai Sathya stated that the Centre had not condemned what had happened to Vaiko, something that only showed that no matter which party comes to power, Tamil citizens would only be treated as 'second grade' citizens. The cadres raised slogans against the Sri Lankan government. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena's pictures were burnt by MDMK cadres to display their resentment. Following the protest, Sathya also claimed that the rights of Tamil citizens should be protected at all costs. (India Today)

Muslims Council demands halt to vigilante action against Muslims
In a letter to Prime Minister:
The Muslims Council of Sri Lanka yesterday said that vigilante action against the Muslim community by extremist groups continues with impunity.
The Council in a letter to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that the mob attack and violence on September 26 against the 32 Rohingya refugees who are under the care of UNHRC housed in Ratmalana is evidence of impunity that is being offered to the racists.
The Council in a letter issued under the hands of its President N.M. Ameen called up the Prime Minister to immediately intervene and ensure that this type of vigilante action by extremists is censured and the perpetrators brought to Justice.
The letter: Vigilante action against the Muslim community by Buddhist extremists continues with impunity with the tacit support of the Police and the Government. The absolute majority of Muslims in this country voted for a change in government in 2015 because of the impunity afforded to extremist Buddhist groups by the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa administration. Yet, incitement and hate carried out against our community by the Bodu Bala Sena, Sinhala Ravaya and the Ravana Balakaya continue in the presence of senior police officials and calls for establishing the rule of law go unheeded by your Government.
Complaints to the IGP, Minister Sagala Ratnayake, the President and yourself have been ignored. The racist organisations have been joined by a new set of mercenaries under the Sinhala National Front banner. Most of them are violating ball conditions set by various courts of law on charges of inciting hate and violence. None of them have been charged under ICCRP, while a 19-year-old Muslim boy from Danture, Kandy, was remanded for over three months for posting a picture against Buddhism on his instagram page.
The mob attack and violence against the 32 Rohingya refugees who are under the care of UNHCR housed in Ratmalana is evidence of the impunity that is being offered to these racists who forced the Police to arrest these refugees. These refugees include 17 children and seven females and seven males. Most of these children are below the age of 5.
In this attack led by Akmeemana Dayarathana Thera under the banner of the Sinhala National Front, they surrounded and held hostage the Rohingya Muslims who were under the protection UNHCR. They were demanding the immediate deportation of them back to Myanmar. The Police arrested the refugees claiming ignorance of their right to stay and were brought to the Mt. Lavinia Police Station for detention. They were subsequently released when it was proved that they were legitimate refugees under the care of UNHCR. Later in the afternoon, the extremists have once again surrounded and caused damages to their residence, forcing them to be evacuated once again. The police have moved them to the Boosa camp.
The mob threatened to kill all of them and also start a riot against the Muslims. This threat was made in the presence of senior police personnel and media. The videos of these threats are available on social media too. The police failed to take action against this hate crime by a violent mob. No Buddhist monk or civilian has been arrested for threatening the peace of people who are under the protection of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
This is an issue that needs to be settled between the Government and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. The Muslims have been targeted unnecessarily.
We call upon you, Honourable Sir, to immediately intervene and ensure that this type of vigilante action by Buddhist monks or extremists is censured and the perpetrators brought to justice immediately.

Addressing the gathering, President of the Amateur Rowing Association of Sri Lanka Rohan Fernando noted,What you saw at the finals is the crme de la crme of Sri Lanka rowing.
Some of the rowers just returned after taking part in Asian Rowing Championships in Thailand. 13 of them competed and some of our crews came to A finals which is a good standard after many moons.
Our crews are now capable of clocking 6.30 minutes over 2 kilometre course which is commendable when compared with international standards of 5.40 to 6.20 minutes over 2000 metres.
The timings change from venue to venue due to turbulence and wind resistance. I am confident that our crews can shave some seconds off to be considered for entry into world rankings before too long.

Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms Chairman, attorney-at-law Lal Wijenayake said the main aim of the new Constitution should be creating a Sri Lankan identity.
"The Constitution in India has been able to create an Indian identity after several decades.Today, the Indians do not think much about their religion and community, but they all regard themselves as Indians.We must create the same situation here as well,he said.
He was addressing the gathering at the seminar held yesterday to make Sri Lanka Army personnel aware on constitutional reforms at the Narahenpita Military Hospital.
"Today, we need a Constitution which unites the country and take it forward. The rights of all citizens should be protected and all types of resources should be distributed equally among all communities.The Constitution reforms should be accepted by all communities.All citizens should be equal stakeholders in the power structure.Although the Constitutions were enacted in 1972 and 1978, there was no public consultation and this later led to a various problems.
But, on this occasion, We have acted in very transparent manner by obtaining the views of public on Constitutional reforms.This is very democratic.We heard public views and proposals on constitutional reforms from all parts of the country. The New Constitution was the request from the people at the previous Presidential election. It is why all the people from South to North voted for the government despite their religion, race and party.We must fulfill their aspirations, he added.

New flavours in town
&Co, the exclusive pub and restaurant of The Steuart by Citrus recently unveiled a new menu with 17 exclusive dishes for a whole new experience. Catering mainly to western cuisine lovers since its inception two years ago, The Steuart sits in the elegant Dutch Hospital.
The Steuarts &Co Pub and Restaurants existing menu undergoes a transformation every four to six months, adding in tastes and flavours inspired from the west to the orient. The chefs at &Co have decided to include 17 new dishes comprising three kinds of bites, 13 mains and one dessert.
Starters at &Co present an interesting combination of the finest Italian flavours wrapped in the Italian Delight along with an infusion of Mediterranean delicacies discovered in the Cold Mezze Platter. The Italian Delight uses high grade ingredients such as the Buffalo Mozzarella and the Parma ham imported directly from Italy, and will be served with melon and tomatoes offering a rich blend of flavours.
As for desserts, the &Co has made another change by placing three varieties of dessert choices on a single platter. According to Chef Panduka, The Steuart is popular for offering sizable dessert platters for its customers. But as majority of its customers are office employees from the neighbourhood, they prefer a quick luncheon and often overlook the desserts due to time constraints. Taking the matter into account Chef Panduka and his team of culinary experts have introduced the Trio of Desserts with a three in one option, appealing to more palettes. The new dessert menu will offer you a combo of Tiramisu, Chocolate Mousse and Apple Tart.
As for the Main dishes, &Co has prioritised on preserving its Scottish -British flavours while catering to the rising demands of traditional Sri Lankan flavours. Creating new trends in the gastronomic encounters, &Co presents its new menu serving Vegetable Risotto, Traditional Sri Lankan Beef Curry and Thai Me Up. While the Risotto caters to veggie lovers, the traditional Sri Lankan Beef Curry satisfies the meat lovers seeking authentic taste in pork and beef curries outside their homes. And for those craving for a spicy yet saucy noodle dish, Thai Me Up is the ideal choice. Inspired by Mongolian flavours, Thai Me Up incorporates the Pad Thai noodle and comes in 4 distinct varieties such as Chicken, Beef, Pork and veggie.
Chef Panduka of The Steuarts &Co Pub and Restaurant explained that bites are essentially a Sri Lankan requisite whereas Europeans dont usually consume bites with their drinks. &Co Pub has introduced three kinds of bites including Beef stew, Battered Oyster Mushrooms, and Marinated Chicken Skewers flaunting a Mediterranean touch.

No provision to transfer powers to Provincial Governors: GL
Professor G.L. Peiris said there is no provision with the Constitution to transfer powers to Provincial Governors once a Provincial Council is dissolved. He was addressing a press conference of the Joint Opposition yesterday in Colombo.
Prof. Peiris said the Government is looking forward to postpone the Provincial Council elections through implementing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution. But there are no provisions with the Constitution to transfer powers to Governors and postpone the elections.
Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardena said the government is seeking every possible way to postpone elections. According to him, the speaker is partial and his behaviour is shameful.
Tissa Vitharana said the people of the country will be affected since the government is trying to allocate a huge sum of money for the defence budget through the forthcoming budget proposal for 2018. According to him, the government allocates such a huge amount to the defence budget on the advice of the United States. Considering the recent price increase of LP Gas, it is proved that the government doesnt bother about harassing the people, he added.
Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila said there is a huge financial misconduct behind the receiving of an Indian ship for the Sri Lanka Navy. The former Defence Secretary had to resign from his post since he refused to approve this ship transaction, Gammanpila said.
The JVP and TNA is also a part of the UNP itself.'' Gammanpila added that most probably the Provincial Council election will not be held next March as the Prime Minister said because the process of holding elections will takes time. He added that the intension of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by bringing the 20th Amendment to the Constitution is to become the President at the 2020 Presidential Election.
There maybe an amendment to the 20th Amendment mentioning that only persons, who have completed 40 years uninterrupted service in Parliament can contest the next Presidential election. Only then will the Prime Minister be qualified and he can become the President unanimously, he said.

P e n a l i z e d f o r w h o t h e y a r e: The Rohingyas misery
It was most distressing to watch the news item on 26 September of the so called protest by some unruly monks and coarse looking men in front of the supposed refuge of Rohingya asylum seekers. This place I believe is in the bustling Colombo suburb of Mt. Lavinia. The protest was held on a busy weekday, causing much inconvenience to the general public.
From what we can gather, these refugees, having escaped from harrowing events in their native Myanmar, were afloat on a small boat in Sri Lankan waters when they were detained by our navy. The journey in the rough seas of the Bay of Bengal would have been testing, especially for the women and children who until now have lived in peaceful villages, occupied mainly in agriculture. Even on a straight line, the distance from Myanmar to Sri Lanka is approximately 1,400 miles. In the windy and choppy seas, a boat cannot sail on a straight line.
Legend has it that some two thousand e years ago,an errant prince and his companions were put on a boat and exiled from a land somewhere close to the starting point, perhaps present day Bengal. The father, the king, could not overlook the young mans misdemeanours any longer. This was heavy punishment. Banishment over the ocean would mean never to see his son again.There were no reliable navigational aids then, and those in the water went where the wind and the waves took them.
It was a long and hazardous journey, and after a violent storm the young men were washed ashore on the sandy beaches of far-away Lanka, to face new adventures in the strange land. Those were happy days, before humans had invented inconveniences like national borders, passports and visas. The indigenous to the island at the time, had no appreciation of what this chance landing of strange men on their shore bode. In all probability, they had neither the will nor the capacity to do anything about it either. As they say, the rest is history.
In the intervening two thousand years humans have evolved so much that we may well be another species. We do everything differently now. Technology has brought food, clothing and creature comforts within easy reach. Religions have mellowed us. Science and education have enlightened us. Laws have disciplined us.Our concepts have become larger and broader.
But then, we encounter incidents like that of September 26, and the whole assumption of an advancing civilization comes into doubt. The primitive passions rise, the fanatic emerges and the savage takes charge.
Victims of circumstance
These Rohingya refugees were victims of circumstances, penalized not for something they have done (especially the women and children), but for who they are. They did not leave their hearths and homes for economic betterment. If that was the reason to brave the Bay of Bengal, Sri Lanka would be a strange choice. It was a fear for their lives that emboldened them to embark on the dangerous voyage. They are human beings in distress.
This is not a situation for us to look at through eyes of politics or even particularities. These unfortunates have left behind everything they owned in order to save their lives. We need not look at the justice of the situation or the history of the problem. It does not matter what nationality, religion, politics or the colour the desperate refugees belong to. In such situations we do not ask for whom the bell tolls.
Sri Lanka should be proud to welcome them, give them succour and hope. True, we are a poor and over-populated country and cannot indefinitely support refugees on our soil. The country can work with the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) and other countries to find a permanent solution. Perhaps we can be a transit point for the refugees. But as long as they are here, we have a duty of care. The world should see that while we have our own problems, we are not an ungenerous people and certainly not poor in human spirit. This is what being civilized is all about.
One cannot help but notice the few Buddhist monks at the protest, who stood out like sore thumbs. In the moral confusion of the day, it is not surprising that some of the clergy are pulled into matters far outside of a spiritual journey. We see several of them involved in political and other worldly matters; seeking rich and powerful patronage, succumb to the allure of creature comforts far above the average and indulge in the occult. The power of Maya is immense indeed.
We can only observe that Buddhism is one of the profoundest philosophies to have emerged out of the Indian sub-continent. Not everyone who can claim perfect understanding of its deep and difficult message. But anybody could act in its name.
That is a tragedy, and yet, like all things corporeal, a Maya.
The Misunderstood Roots of Burmas Rohingya Crisis
Over the past month, a crackdown by Burmas military has forced more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims from Rakhine state to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh in what the UN human-rights chief has called a textbook example of ethnic cleansing. The military crackdown was prompted by an attack on August 25th by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), a Muslim militant group with reported links to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, on security outposts.
The international community has condemned the violence unleashed by the Burmese military on Rohingya civilians. It has also voiced sharp criticism of Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel laureate and de-facto Burmese leader, for, in the view of her critics, not doing enough to protect the Rohingya, who have been stateless for more than three decades. But where humanitarian groups and Western nations see the worlds most persecuted minority, the government of Burma (also known as Myanmar) and an overwhelming majority of its people see a foreign group with a separatist agenda, fuelled by Islam, and funded from overseas. Its this difference in perception that will make any resolution of the Rohingya issue extremely difficult.
It gets to this notion of ethnicity in the Myanmar mind that I think the West doesnt quite understand, Derek Mitchell, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Burma from 2012 to 2016, said. We in the international community see the Rohingya as innocent people who just want to call themselves a name and who are uniquely abused for it. And, of course, its true they are largely innocent and uniquely abused. But to people in Myanmar, the name suggests something much more.
Tensions between Muslims and Buddhists
Tensions between the Bengali-speaking Muslims and Buddhists in Rakhine state have existed for decadessome would say centuriesbut the most significant inflection point came in 1982 when Burmas junta passed a law that identified 135 ethnicities entitled to citizenship. The Rohingya were not among them, though they had enjoyed equal rights since Burma became independent from British rule in 1948. Almost overnight, they were stripped of their citizenship.
In the years since then, the Rohingya were persecuted, steadily lost their rights, and were the victims of violence. The worst of this violence erupted in 2012 following the rape of a Buddhist woman allegedly by Muslim men. That prompted massive religious violence against the Rohingya, forcing 140,000 of them into camps for internally displaced people. International pressure resulted in the military government agreeing to grant the Rohingya a reduced form of citizenship if they registered themselves as Bengalinot Rohingya. Although many Muslims in Rakhine state were previously indifferent to how they were labelled, the years of oppression, combined with the type of citizenship they were being offered, made the offer unpalatable.
Activists and leaders in the [Rohingya] community are very protective of that name. They see it as protective of their identity and dignity after so many basic rights have been taken from them in recent years. The name has also been essential to their international campaign for attention, Mitchell said.
For the Burmese government, the word Rohingya is particularly fraught. This is because if the government acknowledges Rakhines Muslims as members of the Rohingya ethnic group, then under the 1982 citizenship lawironically, the same measure that stripped the Rohingya of their citizenshipthe Muslims would be allowed an autonomous area within the country. And therein lies the crux of the problem: The Burmese fear a Rohingya autonomous area along the border with Bangladesh would come at the expense of Rakhine territory. The Burmese military, which has cracked down on Rohingya civilians, views this as a possible staging area for terrorism by groups like ARSA.
This fear is very deeply felt and not understood in the Westand it comes from a real place rooted in Burmas history, Mitchell said.
Caught up in the crossfire
That real place dates back to the aftermath of World War II, when the forebears of the Rohingya appealed to Pakistan, which at the time included what is now Bangladesh, to annex their territory. Pakistan did not do so. Subsequently, many of the Muslims took up arms and fought a separatist rebellion until the 1960s, though vestiges of the rebellion continued until the 1990s.
So when the Rakhine and others in Myanmar look at whats going on with the name Rohingya, the desire for recognition as an accepted ethnicity, now this militant activity in their name, and calls by some for international intervention, including a safe zone, they see that as a separatist agenda by other means, Mitchell said. And those caught in the middle are hundreds of thousands of innocent Rohingya.
The Rakhines themselves are an ethnic minority in Burma, though they are predominantly Buddhist, and so share the same faith as nearly 88 percent of the rest of the country.
Indeed, Maung Thway Chun, the editor of a news weekly for hard-line Buddhist nationalists, told Joe Freeman, a journalist based in Rangoon: [W]e dont want Muslims to swallow our country  They will not finish with attacking just Rakhine. They will also invade Chin State or Irrawaddy region, he said, referring to two states located to the immediate South and North East of Rakhine. Then this country will be a Muslim country. It is such a shame for us that the land we inherited from our former generations will be lost in our time.
That may sound absurd in a country with a 4 percent Muslim population, but its an argument that many Burmese make, pointing to ARSAs growing presence in Rakhine and surrounding areas. Bangladesh has watched with growing concern the groups activity on its soil, and proposed military operations with Burma against it.
The Burmese government, under international pressure, has tried to come up with a solution to this issue, setting up a commission under Kofi Annan, the former UN Secretary-General. The so-called Advisory Commission on Rakhine State issued a number of recommendations, including a review of the 1982 citizenship law. Suu Kyi, the countrys de-facto leader, embraced those recommendations made on August 25th. But just hours after that report was made public, ARSA carried out its attacks, prompting the militarys crackdown, and the subsequent allegations of ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya.
Suu Kyi condemned
Suu Kyi has been widely condemned for her controversial remarks about the Rohingya, as well as her perceived silence on the violence inflicted upon them. Several commentators have argued the Nobel laureate has lost her moral authority. Her fellow Nobel peace laureates Desmond Tutu and Malala Yousafzai have urged her to protect the Rohingya. Her speech this week was also condemned because she did not mention the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya.
Tom Malinowski, the Obama-era assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights, and labour, told me he had warned Suu Kyi that extremist groups will eventually provoke a confrontation as a means of recruiting fighters for violent attacks and, when they eventually do, Burma has no defence against groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. He said he also told Suu Kyi the Burmese military will willingly fall for that trap [of responding with force against civilian populations], because it can use the ensuing confrontation to rally Buddhists to its side, and thus preserve its authority.
But Mitchell said he found reasons for optimism in Suu Kyis remarks this week. The Burmese leader repeatedly appealed to the international community to work with the Burmese to find a solution.
Thats an opening, Mitchell said. To me thats an opportunity.

Petitioner yet to serve summons on Lankaenews editor
The Supreme Court was informed that the petitioner is yet to serve summons on Lankaenews website editor Sandaruwan Senadheera who is residing in the United Kingdom.
Presidents Counsel Hemantha Warnakulasuriya appearing on behalf of the petitioner who filed 14 contempt of Court cases, informed Supreme Court that the petitioner is expecting to serve summons on Lankaenews editor through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
He made these remarks when the contempt of Court applications for allegedly publishing defamatory articles which appeared in Lankaenews defaming the judges from the Apex Court to the Magistrates Court castigating their characters, were taken up in Supreme Court.

These petitions are to be taken up for mention on February 20 next year.
These 14 complaints had been filed by former Deputy Mayor of Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council, Attorney-at-Law Madura Vithanage, complaining that there had been a series of articles published, appeared in the social media website/facebook named Lankaenews in which the judges and the Judicial Institutions had been critically ridiculed and intimidated and at certain instances there had been scathing attacks on judges commencing from Magistrates to the Chief Justice.

Plantation Industries Ministry to launch $100 million loan scheme to modernize Sri Lankas tea factories
Addressing the 27th AGM of the Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association (SLTFOA), Minister of Plantation Industries, Navin Dissanayake announced that the ministry is expecting to launch the loan scheme worth of $100 million received from Japan including Japanese government in December or early January next year.
He said that the loan scheme is aimed at modernizing the country tea factories. The tea factory owners will be able to access the loan scheme through the Peoples Bank at a low interest rate of 4-5 per cent.
The SLTFOA AGM was also graced by Minister of Finance and Media, Mangala Samaraweera, Ministry of Home Affairs, Vajira Abeywardena, Minister of Lands and Parliament Affairs, Gayantha Karunathilaka and Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board, Rohan Pethiyagoda. The Minister revealed that the Ceylon Tea global promotional campaign which was delayed for over seven years would finally commence in January next year. He said We have selected an advertising manager at last and will put it for Cabinet approval. The Ceylon Tea Promotion Fund currently has an excess of USD 40 million which was funded through the Tea Promotion and Marketing levy of Rs 3.50 for every kilo imposed on tea exporters.
Dissanayake asserted the tea industry was over-regulated, obstructing the growth of the industry. Making a comparison with the regulation of the tea industry and the apparel sector, he pointed out that less regulation had helped the apparel sector to become the top export commodity within a short period of time. Therefore, he urged all stakeholders in the tea industry to agree with a way to de-regulate the tea industry.
The minister urged the tea industry to reduce its dependency on state subsidies by setting buffers to self sustain during crisis periods when global tea prices fall sharply. He revealed that the Government had provided Rs 8 billion as subsidies to the sector, to minimize losses occurred during last tea price fall. Commenting on the number of tea factories, Dissanayake said there are over 700 tea factories in the country including RPCs which is way too much and its should not be a measure of success. Since I became the Minister of Plantation Development, I have stopped issuing new licences to factories. There were too many licences being issued during the past 15 years. He said that strengthening and consolidation of tea factories while expanding profitability was the urgent need for the country. The minister assured the present and the prime minister is on the line to support the countrys tea industry.

The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce had invited a section of media to cover the event held under the theme The Role of the National Agency for Public Private Partnership.
Wijesinghe, a former Board of Investment Chairman, for reasons best known to him, wanted his speech not to be reported in the local press. Wijesinghe after his new appointment on earlier occasions has not been Press shy and has spoken at several forums.
The public are keen to hear the views of the Public Private Partnership Unit of the Finance Ministry of Sri Lanka and it is disconcerting that the concerned bureaucrats are media shy and want to make their speeches behind closed doors.

One mom sewed incredibly accurate Disney costumes for her daughter to wear at Disney World but now even the older, soon-to-be-married princesses have gowns to wear. And they look so stunning; they will definitely turn a regular wedding ceremony into a magical real-life fairytale.
Japanese wedding dress company Kuraudia Co. has partnered with Disney to create a collection of colorful bridal gowns that look just like the ones in our beloved stories. In total, the company is making fourteen dresses from six princesses (Belle, Ariel, Rapunzel, Aurora, Snow White, and Cinderella). Each design will be available for rent starting in November, running at about $3,600 a pop. There will also be an option to get a matching Prince Charming tux for an additional $900.
As stunning as these dresses are, a Disney representative has confirmed to Insider that the collection will only be available in Japan. There are, however, plenty of reasons to visit the Land of the Rising Sun so why not get married and spend the honeymoon there as well

The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrates Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday fixed for December 12 by the Colombo High Court.
When the application was taken up before High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi, counsel appearing on behalf of Prof. Samarasekara filed written submissions in court and the Attorney General was directed to file written submissions before the next inquiry date.
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents.
Earlier former Colombo chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen.
On September 15, 2016 Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail for the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.
However, through his revision application Prof.Samarasekara sought an order to revise Colombo Magistrates Court order to refuse him anticipatory bail.
Prof. Samarasekara denied allegations leveled against him and maintained that he had not committed any offence.

Pure gold for Goddess Durga
Designed by Kolkata-based fashion designer Agnimitra Paul, it took around two-and-half months and 50 artisans to make the extravagant outfit. Using more than 22kg of 22-carat gold, artisans from Bengal crafted a beautiful sari with intricate embroidery.
Durga Puja in Kolkata is more about grandeur and creativity than rituals. As the city kicks off the biggest gala of the year, hundreds have been heading towards London! Well, we dont mean booking flight tickets, but this version of London thats in North Kolkata. Set foot in Santosh Mitra Square, and you find yourself amidst the iconic London Bridge, Big Ben, London Eye and Buckingham Palace  all this at Sealdah Park.
And thats not all. Inside this gorgeous Buckingham Palace replica there something that has never been done before.
All the idols at this pandal are wearing haute couture by Agnimitra Paul for the clubs 82nd celebrations. And Ma Durga idol adorns a sari made of pure gold! Yes, using more than 22kg of 22-carat gold, artisans from Bengal have crafted a beautiful sari with intricate embroidery. Along with floral motifs, butterflies, birds, a giant peacock has been embossed on the sari. Studded with gemstones, there is minakaari work as well.
Over two-and-half months, 50 artisans worked tirelessly to execute the extravagant outfit by the Kolkata-based fashion designer. Pradip Ghosh, president of the puja committee, told indianexpress.com that they wanted to do something unique this year and thats when when his son and general secretary, Sajal Gosh, suggested this idea.
We have seen, gods being decorated with gold jewellery and dresses made with gold zari. But never before has an entire outfit been crafted with pure gold, Ghosh said, over the telephone.
But it wasnt just about thinking out of the box. A veteran jeweller for decades and former president of the Swarna Shilpa Bachao Committee, Ghosh said one purpose of this initiative was also to put the skills of Bengal gold artisans in limelight. I have been part of many jewellery exhibitions worldwide, and also have seen people around the world showing great interest in the intricate and delicate design of Bengal jewellers. With this elaborate and one-of-its-kind sari, we want to show the world how talented our artisans are, the local Trinamool Congress leader said, adding, It gives me great joy and satisfaction, that the hard work has paid off and people have lauded the work of Bengal artists.
Saying that there are more than 1.3 lakh artisans directly or indirectly associated with this industry in Bengal, Ghosh hopes, this exposure will help bring them a brighter future. The gold for the sari has been sponsored by Senco Gold and Diamond, and the chief artisans of the jewellery chain collaborated with Paul to take up this mammoth challenge. As this has never been done before, Agnimitra (Paul) and artists Govinda and Pappu took this as a challenge to do something extraordinary. The idols  created with finesse and skill  have been crafted by famous Kumortuli artist Mintu Pal, along with some of the best goldsmiths in the state.
The idols have been placed inside a mandap that has been built as a replica of Britains Buckingham Palace, with massive chandeliers and Renaissance-inspired paintings decked on the walls. While the decor may showcase British icons, the centre-point of the idol is all about highlighting Bengals rich heritage.

Rahuman urges action to curb extremism
Attack on Rohingya refugees:
UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman yesterday urged the government to take action to curb extremist groups in the country.
He explained that the extremist group which attacked Rohingya refugees on September 26 had been involved in similar racist attacks for the last 2-3 years with little action taken against them.
These people were acting like thugs in front of the Police and were allowed to get away with it. Among this group was one person who was previously arrested and out on bail. He has clearly violated bail conditions and yet not arrested, said Rahuman.
The Colombo District MP said such inaction by the government made those within and outside of government question whether the regime was party to such acts.
Those who voted for the current government hoped that they would put a stop to these racist attacks but I am disappointed that it has continued, he said.
The President and Prime Minister travel the world trying to win the faith of the international community but these acts will just damper their efforts, said Rahuman.
He further asked that the government call for a report from the intelligence services and find out who is responsible for these groups and who is funding them.
We cannot have reconciliation and development with such groups. The end result if this continues will only be a change in regime.
Even we, who are with the government, have a problem with how things are going, said the UNP MP.
There is no point just having two thirds majority in Parliament. We need to have law and order ensured in the country, he added.

He said this clause should be included in keeping with powers vested in the Party Advisory Committee in terms of section 16 sub-section 6 of the SLFP Constitution.
Punchinilame had said while he appreciated the self censorship policy adopted by media institutions in reporting religious tensions and clashes, he would suggest that these institutions should not give any publicity to actions or statements against Buddhism or the Buddha Sasana by any politician irrespective of his or her status.

The Rich Heritage of  Galle Fort
Juliet Coombe takes a look at this very special UNESCO World Heritage Site and its magnificent rampart walls and fascinating back streets.
Enter the old fortress built out of breathing corals as the main black tunnel gate by the cricket grounds opens up into a gash of bellowing air, with distended creepers riding pillion on giant Banyan trees hobnobbing with an ancient merchant caste. A strange choreography can always be detected here, with the musical call to prayer emanating from the mosque or the temples sound system merging with the toots of ice cream vendors bicycle horns and other hot and spicy snacks and pickle vendors plying the sonorities of their trade as the Indian Ocean thunders and whooshes by, barfing on the black rocks its named after.
The real value
Asias most exciting sea Fort is at the crossroads of massive commercial changes and the greatest challenge today is to maintain its rich history while also trying to keep the original Fort people in situ. But to survive they recognise that livelihoods need to be created, though not at the expense of the Heritage of the buildings, which is always a fine balancing act. Luckily UNESCO is also evolving its views and one thing they have accepted is that the benefit of being a world heritage site is that the money made from it must trickle down to the people and their lives, so theyre also encouraging things like home-stay tourism.
It is important with increasing tourism numbers to see how the Galle Fort fits into the country and the world and how heritage can unite people and bring about peace, because what the heritage guardians of the fort want people to understand is, Galle Fort is not just the heritage of the people of Galle, its a shared heritage for all of us that live on the planet.
The Galle Heritage Foundation is passionate about making everyone understand the value of keeping the living heritage alive, demonstrating this through exciting exhibitions at the Maritime Museum and discussions within the community on the importance of the various architecture and keeping them intact, as this is where the real value of the buildings lie. After all easier buildings that can be changed or modernized can be purchased much more cheaply outside the Fort, demonstrating the extra value generated through heritage. The more a building is changed, the quicker the heritage value will disappear and the interest in the four hundred year old time locked fort.
Foreign sociologists
One problem with the Fort is its closeness to the sea, which makes it very difficult to maintain the buildings because of the decaying effect of sea spray salt. So you have to look at that aspect as well, because the owners cant spend money on maintaining the house unless they generate enough income to do so. The project restoring 55 historic houses in Galle Fort was very successful as today you can find many of them looking out for their historical plaques. One of the most serious architectural changes which have been done to the Dutch period houses was that the open verandas had been bricked up over the last century, because the majority of the people of the Fort are Muslims today. Some foreign sociologists came and asked Galle Heritage Foundation why we told them to open up those facades, as if its wrong to tell them to change that which is against their culture. However they left happy on discovering that it was vital for cross ventilation purposes, and so in 2007 and 2008 verandas were again opened up and many things were found in the walls including original columns as nothing was ever knocked down or thrown away in the past. The blocking up of them probably originated from desert living where it is sensible to stop the sand blowing into the buildings. When the facades were opened they found many interesting things bricked up inside. If you look at the original countries of many that have moved to the Fort through trade, there may be practical reasons why certain things were done to buildings but these might not be appropriate when they come to a place like tropical Sri Lanka.
For those visiting this fascinating living Sea Fort it is important to keep it neat and tidy so it is a pleasant experience for the next lot of visitors and people living here. It is important with tourist numbers growing that you take away all your rubbish so that you can help protect the amazing marine life around the Fort. Please note it is worth bringing your swim costumes and a sarong to cover up as you can snorkel at the beach near the British built 1938 lighthouse.
There is a dream that one day a period boat, a model of Avondster or something like that is built to take the tourists around the Galle harbour area opposite the Lighthouse to get a better idea of how challenging merchant sea life really was and to make better links with it being a trading port and bring to life the real life experiences they faced trading in gems, spices and wild animals.

The Supreme Courts five-judge-bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep yesterday concluded preliminary arguments put forward in support and against the appeal filed by Galle district parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe over her dual citizenship issue.

Two children had worms removed from their bodies on September 26, said Consultant Surgeon Dr. Ajith Arthanayake. He said the worms, which have a white hue, are about 3 to 5 inches long.
Most of the affected are children. Domestic pets maybe the source of these worms entering the human body. Mosquito bites too may introduce eggs into the human body which later develop into worms after gestation.

Sri Lanka great Sangakkara says farewell to first-class cricket
LONDON: Ex-Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara says he will miss cricket terribly but believes he is retiring from the first-class game at the right time.
Sangakkara, 39, made 35 not out in his final first-class innings for Surrey against Lancashire on Wednesday.
He is fifth on the list of all-time run scorers in Test cricket, with 12,400 runs in 134 appearances.
Sometimes you hold on a bit too long and I always think its better to let go a bit sooner than later, he said.
Left-handed batsman Sangakkara, who will turn 40 on 27 October, ended his first-class career with 20,911 runs.
Almost 1,500 of those runs came for Surrey in the County Championship this season at an average of 106.50.
He told BBC Sport: Ill miss it terribly, without a doubt, but thats a good thing. A lot of players walk away bitter and upset and regretting a lot of the things that might have been.
I walk away with a few regrets, like anyone would, but Im absolutely happy with the way I played the game and what Ive achieved.
The game goes on and thats the beauty of any sport. It doesnt matter who retires or who comes into play - the sport will be bigger than all of us.
He will continue playing in overseas T20 leagues in 2018.
Sangakkara has revealed that, as a youngster, he did not think he would be good enough to play international cricket for Sri Lanka.
However, a first-class career spanning almost two decades has cemented his legacy as one of the legends of the game.
Only Indias Sachin Tendulkar (34,357) has scored more runs in all formats of international cricket than Sangakkara (28,016), while he is also the leading Test run-scorer for his country.
Mahela Jayawardene (11,814) is the only other batsman to pass 10,000 Test runs for Sri Lanka.
Sangakkara played for three English counties - Durham, Warwickshire and Surrey - during his career and has produced some of his best ever form during his final season as a first-class cricketer.  BBC
Some of his highlights in 2017 include:
l Eight centuries and 1,491 runs in 16 County Championship innings, making him the leading run-scorer in either division this season.
l A century in each innings of Surreys draw against Middlesex at Lords in May.
l His 100th hundred in all formats of cricket in Surreys One-Day Cup quarter-final win over Yorkshire in June.

Tourism growing rapidly: Amaratunga
Tourism in Sri Lanka is economically important and is growing rapidly, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
The minister was addressing the gathering at the official ceremony of the World Tourism Day celebrations held at Arcade Independence Square, Colombo.
Sri Lanka has the ability to become one of the best tourism countries in the world. We have already identified many priority projects to boost and sustain tourism growth over the coming years, he said.
The minister said countries and regions with tourism-driven economies have become increasingly concerned with the environmental as well as social-cultural problems associated with unsustainable tourism. As a result, there is now increasing agreement on the need to promote sustainable tourism development to minimize environmental impact and maximize socio-economic and overall benefits at tourist destinations.
Out of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations, SDG8, SDG12 and SDG14 apply directly to the tourism sector.
The effective monitoring and implementation of these SDGs would promote a sustainable tourism industry that creates employment, promotes local culture and products, and nurtures sustainable production and consumption patterns across all major and upcoming tourism hubs in the island.
He said the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) declared 2017 as the International Year of Sustainable Tourism for Development. This is fitting for Sri Lanka as we embark on a journey of transforming our tourism sector for the betterment of the planet and its people.
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) Chairman Kavan D. Ratnayaka said tourism is Sri Lankas third highest export industry with foreign exchange earnings and employment numbers increasing annually. We hope to attract 2.5 million tourists this year and many international tourism promotions campaigns are in the process of achieving this target. Moreover, tourism has created opportunities for a multitude of small and medium entrepreneurs and businesses around the country. Sri Lanka has launched a Tourism Vision and a four-year Strategic Plan that strongly endorses the principles of sustainable tourism, he said.
The SLTDA has organized a two-day special programme that includes an exhibition on Sustainable Tourism, Photographic Exhibition, the launching of three books on lesser known attractions in Western, Southern and Central Provinces, and awarding certificates to winners of an essay competition conducted at school level.

Speaking at the World Tourism Day celebrations held at the Arcade Colombo he said that it is also estimated that around 300,000 Sri Lankans have jobs associated with the industry. It is estimated that this year more than 2.5 million people will travel to Sri Lanka to follow their dream of visiting an interesting and exciting destination, he said. The target by both Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Tourism Minister John Amaratunga is to double tourism revenue and employment by 2020.
But, they want us to achieve this target not at any cost, but with responsibility. They want sustainable employment with higher skills and better salaries for our people. They want us to bring back our people who work in other countries by paying them competitive salaries. We believe that with disciplined execution of this plan that we can achieve the target of five million visitors and USD 7 billion revenue by 2020, and ensure a total of 600,000 jobs in the industry, an addition of 300,000. To execute this plan we need support and commitment from many people and institutions. Its a really large project and one that cuts across so many areas of responsibility. At least 20 different government agencies will have to work collaboratively to deliver the plan.
The theme for World Tourism Day this year is Sustainable Tourism  A Tool for Development. This is fitting for Sri Lanka as we embark on a journey to transform our tourism sector towards a sustainable and inclusive future, he added.

Wanted: Popular dialogue on new Constitution
The Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly is now made public. However, in the wake of anxieties aroused on account of constant postponement of Local Government and Provincial Council elections no serious debate or dialogue has taken place. In its place we see only the continuation of former rhetorical outbursts of communal minded forces against it. Even the media does not seem to give it sufficient prominence.
Public agitation against the existing Constitution started immediately after its promulgation. Countless number of protest campaigns was held by civil organisations and almost all parties except the United National Party, which introduced it. Finally, even the UNP decided to change it.
Two issues dominated the protests. One was the need for a solution to the national question. Other was the need to end the authoritarian Executive Presidency. So no Constitutional reform would be meaningful if these two issues could not be satisfactorily resolved by it.
The proposed but yet not finalized reforms gives the public another chance at reviving the dialogue on these two subjects. Though the Interim Report dwells upon more issues of equal significance it is our attempt hereto analyze the behavior of principal political parties on the above two issues. As the United National Party has not made any reservations on the Report we conclude that it is in agreement with it.
National question
The other party in the Government  the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has expressed its reservations. More importantly it has in the beginning of its submission the following sentence: The first paragraph of page one of the draft interim report of the Steering Committee shall be amended as follows. Agreed principles/ formulae shall be substituted by negotiated principles/formulae. This means that it has not given any definitive approval. It may change its stand in the course of the debate, especially with regard to devolution of power and the abolition of the Executive Presidency. This is by a party which ruled the country for 14 years under the existing Constitution. One could also recall that each time it came to power in the interim period it pledged to remove the Executive Presidency and arrive at a negotiated solution to the national question.
It has particularly opposed to any change of Articles 1-9 of the existing Constitution. These refer to the nature of the state, place of Buddhism and the executive presidency. Incidentally the Joint Opposition also objects to any change in the same articles. While the JO totally rejects the Interim Report, the SLFP provisionary does not agree with it, allowing it room to join the JO, if conditions suit them. One may be excused for presuming that the fifth column of the JO in the SLFP wants to remain the Government and enjoy the privileges of office as long as possible before joining the JO at a decisive point of time. It is clear that there is no policy difference between them. They are like twin brothers.
The SLFPs stand is not only intransigent but also confrontational as seen by its following comment with reference to Article 9 which deals with the place of Buddhism and other articles on the nature of State etc.: The Sri Lanka Freedom party is not in agreement to any other alternative proposal in the draft drafted by the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly. This means it is not ready to negotiate and other parties should agree to their diktat. This is despite all formulations keeping the essence of the present formulations intact. It is regarding matters that are in essence not changed by the Interim Report.
Executive Presidency
The SLFP in a volte-face now wants to retain the Executive Presidency as it is. Yet its President who has repeatedly promised to abolish it keeps silent with no comment. People are entitled to know whether he too shares the new view. Should he keep his pledge to the entire people or obey the party It is a matter of conscience.
In contrast, the attitude of the Tamil National Alliance is more flexible. It helps national reconciliation. While it has presented its proposals, it nevertheless says that In the interest of reaching an acceptable consensus, the TNA will be willing to consider agreement with the main principles articulated in the Interim Report, if the same are agreeable to the two main parties. According to the Liam Fox Agreement they are also obliged to do so. The TNA position is most welcome.
The JOs strategy is to defeat the new Constitution when a vote is taken in it in Parliament. It is also to use its twin brother the SLFP to torpedo it before that. In any case the final act of the JO campaign is likely to be the vote in Parliament in which it hopes to prevent the Government receiving a two-thirds majority. As the struggle for a new Constitution hots up there are other minor parties and groups that will join the ethno-religious extremists against it.
It is up to the other parties, especially the Left and civil society to campaign for the safe passage of the draft Constitution in Parliament. The intellectuals, trade unions and mass organizations have a special responsibility to consider it their duty to do s. The present slide to past practices and reneging on election pledges could also be halted or reversed only by such a renewed enhancement of mass action.
It would be a catastrophe if this chance for national reconciliation and unity is defeated again as it happened throughout the last 65 years. It would be the greatest betrayal of the future generations. If it happens history will not absolve us.

Warner ton helps Australia break India winning streak
Bangalore: Opener David Warner hit a sparkling century in his 100th one-day international to help Australia down India by 21 runs and pull off a consolation win on Thursday.
Warners blazing 124 and his 231-run opening stand with Aaron Finch, who made 94, guided the visitors to 334-5 in the fourth game of the five-match series in Bangalore.
The hosts, who lead the series 3-1, faltered in their chase to end on 313-8 despite three half-centuries including a gritty 67 off 69 balls from Kedar Jadhav. Fast bowlers Kane Richardson and Nathan Coulter-Nile shared five wickets between them to snap Indias winning streak of nine ODI games. Virat Kohlis India began its reply on a positive note as openers Rohit Sharma, who hit 65, and Ajinkya Rahane, who made 53, put together a 106-run stand.
Rahane registered a hat-trick of half-centuries and in the next over Sharma hit two big sixes off leg-spinner Adam Zampa to bring up his fifty in style. Richardson broke the century stand after sending Rahane trudging back to the pavilion.
Sharma tried to keep the momentum going with Kohli for company but a big mix-up between the two batsmen got him run out. Kohli was soon bowled by Coulter-Nile for 21.
Hardik Pandya, who scored 41, put on a determined 78-run partnership with Jadhav to keep the chase afloat but it became difficult to keep pace with the mounting run-rate. Jadhav, smashing 7 fours and a six, also got going with Manish Pandey, who scored 33, to put on 61 runs for the fifth wicket, but his wicket took the wheels off the chase.
Earlier electing to bat, the left-right batting pair of Warner and Finch pulverised the Indian bowlers attack in the first 35 overs. Warner hit 12 fours and four sixes. It was his 14th ODI century since making his debut at Hobart in 2009.
The batsman got to his milestone with a boundary off part-time spinner Jadhav, jumping for joy as the runs were marked up. He later fell to Jadhavs off-spin and walked off to a standing ovation.
Finch, who missed out on his second successive century, soon followed his partner after getting caught at mid-on off paceman Umesh Yadav.
Yadav, who returned figures of 4-71, got the prized scalp of skipper Steve Smith to bag his 100th ODI wicket. The visitors lost three wickets in just 15 deliveries.
But Travis Head and Peter Handscomb forged a 63-run fourth-wicket partnership to halt the Indian fightback with some intelligent batting.
Handscomb made a 30-ball 43, laced with three fours and a six, before being bowled by Yadav.
Head made an effective 29. The final match is scheduled for Sunday in Nagpur before the action shifts to the three-match twenty20 series starting October 7. AFP

A welcome move
The decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to implement urgent measures to bring down the prices of essential items, no doubt, will be received with great relief by the general public, who, it has to be conceded, are being weighed down by the escalating cost of living. The prices of several essential food items had soared in recent times, placing a heavy strain on the purse of the fixed income earner. It was only two days ago that the price of LP gas rose by Rs. 110, a cylinder. All hotels and eateries lost no time in announcing the increase in the prices of hoppers, string hoppers and even a cup of plain tea, even before the price increase took effect. Needless to say, these price increases are disproportionate to the actual loss that they may incur as a result of the Gas price hike. Even the price of the buth packet was raised by between 10 and 20 rupees, although it is difficult to comprehend the arithmetic, where a gas cylinder will only cost Rs110 more. The Consumer Protection Authority should move in on the matter and take action against the hotels and eateries trying to make a killing, hiding under the cloak of the Gas price increase.
Television showed how a spokesman for the Lunch Providers Association forcefully declaring their intention to raise the price of a buth packet and in the process making a not so subtle attack on the government, introducing a political element into the whole affair. The Joint Opposition, too, is having a field day, enacting dramas, with their members bringing with them coconuts and samples of essential consumer items to demonstrate what they term as the callousness of an uncaring government. This is all the more reason why the government should take drastic measures to contain the rising prices.
In this connection, the decision taken by the President to instruct the Coconut Development Board to evolve a system to bring down the price of coconuts, which today is hitting the Rs. 100 mark per nut, is to be welcome. He (President) has ordered that the CDB deploy its lorries to deliver coconuts to the doorstep of the consumers, thus eliminating the middleman from the equation, which has been attributed to the steep rise in coconuts. However attention should also be paid towards increasing production. One of the reasons for the failure of the crop, no doubt, is the prolonged drought. It is common to see withered coconut palms along the country's coconut belt in the North Western Province today. There is also the parceling of coconut land by the owners to dispose them off to property developers, for massive gains. Laws should be enacted to halt this practice, or heavy levies imposed on the owners of coconut plantations to dissuade them from selling their lands. On the other hand, every encouragement should be given to increase production, including incentives.
The President's injunction to bureaucrats not to be bound by ARs and FRs when the need arises for urgent import of essential items is also a good move. There are times when a scarcity in the local market demands the urgent import of essential items. The officials, however, are stymied by the restrictions ingrained in the system, particularly in the present times, following the fate that befell two public officials, for carrying out instructions that were contrary to the rule book.
The President has made it known that on no account should the prices of essential items be allowed to escalate and decisions taken in this respect should be implemented, directly and in their entirety. His full focus on tackling the rising cost of living, it is hoped, will bring dividends to the masses.
The COL has been the deciding factor in the make or break of governments in the past and the President no doubt, is cognizant with this reality. It was the COL, and the scarcity of essential items, that brought down the Sirima Bandaranaike government in 1977. Depleted kitchens, or the hiss kussiya, are a sure sign of the diminishing popularity of governments. This holds true for the future as well.
Police, as by-standers
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has taken issue with the police for not dealing firmly with the mob responsible for attacking the Rohingya refugees, installed in a safe house, in Mt. Lavinia, the other day. The minister has asked the IGP to deal with the policemen, at the scene, for making little, or, no attempt, to halt the mob. He charged that the police had failed to do their duty in allowing the mob free rein to run amok. This is not the first time that the police have been passive by-standers while mobs went on the rampage. We have seen this kid glove treatment at other times too, particularly in the outstations, where demonstrators sometimes even overpower the police and burn tyres, with the law looking on. This state of affairs should end, lest a dangerous situation arise, where the police would not count anymore, for the lawbreakers to have their own way.

Yingluck still in Dubai, says Thai PM
THAILAND: Thailands Prime Minister and junta leader on Thursday said fugitive ex-Premier Yingluck Shinawatra is in Dubai, a day after she was handed a five-year jail term in absentia for negligence.
Prayut Chan-O-Chas first clear comments on Yinglucks whereabouts came a month after she ghosted out off Thailand, ducking a court ruling over charges she failed to stop graft and losses in a costly rice subsidy policy by her government.
On Wednesday Thailands top court sentenced her in absentia to five years jail, pulling the plug on her political career. She maintained her innocence throughout the case, which she said was a political fit-up sculpted by her familys enemies among the arch-royalist army and elite.
I learned from the foreign ministry that now she is in Dubai, said Prayut, who toppled Yinglucks government from office in a 2014 coup.
Once a fresh arrest warrant is issued, Thai authorities may proceed with extradition efforts, he told reporters.
Yinglucks older brother Thaksin, also a former premier, has a home in Dubai. The 2001 rise of Thaksin, a billionaire former cop with a magic touch at the polls, rattled Thailands establishment and the country has since see-sawed between elected governments and coups.
He fled Thailand in 2008 to avoid jail on a graft conviction he says was politically motivated.
Defence Minister Prawit Wongsuwan, a key architect of the coup that took down Yinglucks government, said its good she is in Dubai. Although dont have extradition treaty... Dubai officials informed our foreign ministry that they will not allow Yingluck to make any political move. The 50-year-old, who still has the right to appeal, has not appeared in public since pulling the vanishing act on August 25, her initial ruling date.
The Shinawatra siblings lie at the centre of a political battle that has chewed at Thailand for more than a decade.
Shinawatra-backed parties have dominated electoral politics since 2001, enraging Bangkoks military-allied elite.
Unable to beat the Shinawatras at the polls, their rivals have turned to court rulings and coups to repeatedly knock their governments from power. - AFP
