Rangoon is not entirely about the Burmese people
Director Rajkumar Periasamy's Rangoon, starring Gautham Karthik, is set to hit the screens next week. Talking about the film, the director says, "This film is the survival story of 24-year-old Venkat, whose family has been repatriated from Burma. The story is set against the backdrop of north Madras. The youngster, Venkat, faces a lot of challenges and how he comes out of it forms the crux of the film. The film is not entirely about the Burmese people in the city, the repatriots are just a part of the film. This will be a complete entertainer as well." On the title and about casting Gautham, he says, "The film has been titled Rangoon because that place plays a key role in the plot. As soon as I finished the script, Gautham came to mind considering his age, which will be apt for the role." The film has been extensively shot in and around the city. Says Rajkumar, "We were very clear from the beginning that we would never erect a set for the shoot. We wanted only live locations to give that realistic touch to the film."
Music has been composed by debutant Vikram and background score is by Vishal Chandrashekar. Talking about the songs, Rajkumar says, "Yaathriga is one of my favourite songs. Na Muthukumar had written this song based on the theme of Yaadhum Oore Yaavarum Kelir. This song has positive lines about how one has to approach the future. This is the title song of the film."
Ask him about going with two music directors, he says,"This culture is very popular in Bollywood and I wanted to try it out here. Moreover, both have their strengths and have done an equally great job."

Reinventing HRM as paradox navigation
Following is the text of the Prof. Sudatta Ranasinghe memorial oration on May 25 delivered by Prof. Ajantha S. Dharmasiri, Director, Postgraduate Institute of Management (PIM), at the PIM Auditorium.
Prof Sudatta Ranasinghe wrote in HR Challenge: In contemporary organizations HR currently plays the role of a business partner only to a limited extent due to reasons such as lack of capacity and authority of HR to influence strategic level business decisions.  This was one factor that was repeatedly highlighted in many HR researches done in Sri Lanka. On one side, the CEOs lament that my HR person knows HR and not business. On the other side, the HR person laments that I am not given enough exposure in business decisions. I named these two aspects as competency deficit and opportunity deficit in my doctoral studies. The time is opportune to reinvent HRM. One key element in such an endavour is to have clarity of what really HRM is all about.
We can see hundreds of different ways of describing HRM. Some are over simplistic whilst some others are highly scholastic. What could be the best way to approach HRM in defining it related to local needs A think tank from the Institute of Personnel Management (IPM) took the initiative of developing a suitable definition of HRM for Sri Lanka. This move was very significant as IPM being the pioneering and premier HR institute in Sri Lanka, is moving towards a Charter status. Of course, we missed the would have been wonderful contribution of late Prof. Ranasinghe.
Our approach was specific and straightforward. We looked at what is available in terms of HRM definitions, identified key salient points in those and listed them and brainstormed of their relevance to Sri Lanka. That was one aspect. On the other hand, we also brainstormed how to accommodate the socio-cultural and religio-political dimensions influencing management practices in Sri Lanka. Our aim was to find the best fit.
Based on the brainstorming we had as a team and feedback obtained from professionals and professors, the following definition emerged. A strategic and integrated approach in acquisition, development and engagement of talent, using relevant tools, with proper policies, practices and processes in creating a conducive climate towards achieving organizational excellence and societal well-being.
Goals and specific objectives
What we meant by strategic is working towards achieving overall goals and specific objectives of the organization. It is essentially aligning with the broad organizational priorities. It highlights the strategic significance of HRM and the holistic role it should play.
Talent refers to three Cs going in line with Prof. Dave Ulrich, a prolific researcher of HRM from the Michigan University. They are competence, commitment and contribution. He in fact arranges them as an equation.
Talent = Competence X Commitment X Contribution
The multiplication sign in the above equation symbolizes the collaborative and combine nature of the three vital aspects. Competence essentially refers to the knowledge (head), commitment refers to action (hands) and contribution is related to values (heart).
Reinventing...
What we do with talent occupy a significant segment of our definition. Acquisition refers to hiring (recruitment, selection and placement). Engagement means a range of aspects such as involvement, attachment and extra effort.
There is a reference to the term, relevant tools in our definition. What we meant was to incorporate testing methods, assessment techniques etc. which should be linked to the organizational requirements.
We consciously included the term Conducive Climate in our HRM definition. This means a supportive environment within organization. HR has a critical role to play in creating such a climate. Climate refers to those aspects of the environment that are consciously perceived by organizational members. Perception is essentially an understanding based on the information obtained by senses such as eyes and ears. Hence, climate is something people see, hear and feel. That is why we see a difference when we enter a hospital, police station or a restaurant. In summary, climate is what we see and feel when we enter an organization, whereas, culture is something much deeper as bedrock.
The end result of all HR endavours, the way we see, is having twin aspects, Organizational Excellence and Societal Well-being. What we mean by organizational excellence is its overall performance with continuous improvement. It, obviously, include financial results, customer satisfaction, process efficiency and people development, the four perspectives of a typical balanced scorecard.
HR professionals cannot function in isolation ignoring the social realities. This is more relevant to a developing country like ours, where issues such as poverty, unemployment and ethnic tensions cannot be ignored. Thats why we included Societal Well-being as a key outcome of HRM. It highlights the need to support people outside the organization and protecting the environment as well.
Defining HRM clearly was one step towards delivering sustained results. Now we need to put the acts together, in ensuring the awareness, appreciation and application among Sri Lankan HR Professionals. Great vision without great people is irrelevant, so said Jim Collins of Good to Great fame.
HR professionals
Human Resource has always been an evolving function. It not only focuses on the most precious resource in any organization but also engage in actions to ensure the presence of competencies for competitive advantage. As much as it had in the past, and having in the present, the function of HR will have many challenges in the future. It reminds me of seven Gs of HRM in relation to talent, the framework I used in my textbook, HRM for Managers: A Learning Guide. They refer to goal, get, give, grow, glue, glow and guard, each representing a specific function of HR.
The world of HR is full of jargons. My attempt is not to complicate it by adding more terms. As Shakespeare vividly wrote in Romeo and Juliet, What's in a name That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet." Whether we call critical competencies or core capabilities or by any other name, the reality is the need to deliver promptly. That is where HR professionals have to act as thinking performers, in taking the profession forward.
There had been numerous discussions on why HR professionals are at the tap and not at the top. Prof. Dave Ulrich and his team of researchers have been working on an evolving model on the cutting-edge competencies required by the HR professionals. They started identifying the need to play the roles of strategic partner, employee champion, administrative expert and change agent. The seventh revision that came last year which was termed as HR Competency Model of 2016 is revolving around paradox navigation.
The typical dictionary meaning of paradox is that it is a seemingly absurd or contradictory statement or proposition which when investigated may prove to be well founded or true. Navigation on the other hand means the process or activity of accurately ascertaining one's position and planning and following a route. This is the acute need in front of HR professionals.
As Prof. Ulrich explains, navigating paradox means accepting, exploring, and dealing with the inevitable tensions in a business. They have to help the business to be both short and long term, top/down and bottom/up, global and local, divergent and convergent, strategic and operational, etc. By navigating these paradoxes, organizations are more able to respond to the demands of change in todays business context.
In essence, paradox navigation is the ability to steer amidst the many embedded tensions in complex organizational operations. We can raise a few vital questions here. Does the HR professional effectively manage the tensions between high-level strategic issues and operational details Does he/she effectively manage the tensions between internal focus on employees and external focus on customers and investors Does he/she effectively manage the tension between taking time to gather information and making timely decisions Does he/she effectively manage the tensions between global and local business demands Does he/she effectively manage the tensions between the need for change (flexibility, adaptability) and stability (standardization)
The reality is that the HR professionals are constantly wrestling with embedded tensions that must be resolved in some circumstances and cultivated in other circumstances in order to help the business move forward. Wisely navigating through these surrounded strains becomes one of the central challenges for modern HR professionals.
What could be some of these key challenges I would call them the challenge to be lean, seen and green. Lets explore them further.
There is a wave of becoming faster, cheaper and better in an increasingly competitive global scene. HR cannot avoid its influence. Stemming from the Japanese concept of creating value by eliminating waste, lean management has spread its wings to cover both manufacturing and service sectors.
Gone are the days that HR was humanly rich as a department with all sorts of people, mostly dumped by the seniors. Efficiency with regard to optimizing cadre, in clearly identifying the needs and the specific roles associated is of utmost importance. One key thing to remember is that HR has to work hand in hand with other functional departments in being lean. There is no room for silo mentality.
Be Seen is the second challenge. There are a variety of virtual teams that are technologically connected but geographically separated. A global virtual team might have members based in New York, New Delhi and New South Wales. Telecommuting is an arrangement where a person can work from home by connecting through technology without physically coming to work. What could be the possible HR challenges Lets discuss.
Major challenges
Based on my research with two US-based colleagues, it was evident that one major challenge in a virtual team arrangement is to trust each other. If you have worked with someone physically in the same office at least for some time, they found it easier to work as a virtual team. The challenge was to interact with relatively unfamiliar members of the team in a distant location.
It is an interesting HR scenario in this context. Each member of the virtual team based in a different location has to be governed by their local labour laws and other local HR practices. At the same time, there is a global HR strategy. Hence, it is a case of thinking globally and acting locally with regard to HR practices pertaining to virtual team arrangements.
Why the seen factor is so important to HR The answer lies in the nature of virtual teams and telecommuting workforce. They are the new net-centric nomads. Nomads, in the sense that their work desk can be a seat in an airplane with laptop or palmtop connected to the internet. For them, what matters is the connectivity more than the location. Their daily HR functions are carried by a supervisor, also in a remote location. Some of the virtual team members have not seen the central HR colleagues, after their initial hiring discussion. On one hand, it is good to delegate and to make every manager a people manager. However, on the other hand, the vibrant presence of the HR as a guiding and facilitating function is also essential.
Such a scenario leads to a visibility issue. How can HR show its availability for coaching, training, performance advice and other matters Is it practically possible to meet all employees scattered all over What should be the best cost-effective arrangement These are some of the questions that HR professionals have to find answers.
Lets move to the third challenge, which is to be green. We are living in world where nature has begun to strike back. Chaotic weather patterns across the globe are a grim reminder that eco-friendly practices of work need a lot more attention. What matters is not only profit but people and planet as well. Obviously, it impacts HR in collectively ensuring the triple bottom line.
Some common green human resource initiatives in the west include, using Web or teleconferencing to reduce travel, promoting the reduction of paper use and implementing wellness programmes to foster employees proper nutrition, fitness, and healthy living.
The important point here is the need to integrate green initiatives with lean and seen initiatives. In other words, they are not three isolated sets of actions but one holistic path. Take paper reduction for an example. Instead of having piles of personnel files in a store room, a well-designed HR information system (HRIS) will do the needful in a much more effective manner. It is a case of being lean and green at the same time.
By being green, HR has to foster SHE. SHE stands for safety, health and environment. A healthy workforce who perform their duties with safety in mind, without polluting the environment is the growing need of our workplaces.
In essence, HR professionals have to be paradox navigators by being diligent in a digital workplace. As Prof. Ulrichs team has coined, the paradox navigation encompasses eight other key roles an HR professional has to play. He/ she has to be a strategic positioner, a credible activist, a culture and change champion, a human capital curator, a total rewards steward, a technology and media integrator, an analytics designer & interpreter and a compliance manager. It is very clear that when HR professionals play such comprehensive roles committedly, they contribute immensely to their respective organizations. That is when HRM as a profession experiences a rewarding renewal.
In digging deeper, I see a parallel between paradox navigation by western HR researchers and the Yin-Yang concept of eastern wisdom. In simple terms, yin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, femininity and night-time. Yang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and aggressive; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, masculinity and daytime.
To put even more precisely, yin yang are complementary opposites that interact within a greater whole, as part of a dynamic system. Everything has both yin and yang aspects, but either of these aspects may manifest more strongly in particular objects, and may ebb or flow over time. This is the nature of HRM in reality, where managing employee concerns as well as employer concerns need to take place with synergy and harmony.
In other words, showcasing paradox navigation is one way of accepting the eastern duality. This is very much pertinent in the context of change where we are increasingly moving into a Volatile, Uncertain, Chaotic and Ambiguous (VUCA) World.
Paradox navigation can in fact move beyond HR. In practical sense, every manager has to do so in some way or the other. In other words, it is challenge of balancing the harmony between yin and yang.
Leader, manager and administrator
I recall Prof. Sudatta Ranasinghe delivering a thought-provoking speech on indigenous management at a research conference organized by the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. The more we identify ways of harmonize management concepts with indigenous aspects of a culture, better will be its impact. HR professionals in becoming paradox navigators have to fulfill this need.
Thomas J. Watson Junior, the founder of IBM, in his book, A Business and its Beliefs says: "I believe the real difference between success and failure in a corporation can be very often traced to the question of how well the organization brings out the great energies and talents of its people." This is relevant to Sri Lankan organizations and their managers as well. As every manager has a people management role to play, they have to work hand in hand with their HR colleagues. It reminds me what our ancient Subhashitha poet said.
Famous people with wisdom will not get unhappy even when they are much tired. Fragrant Sandalwood will still emanate its fragrance, even if it is crushed or squeezed.
Obviously, this has been very true for Prof. Sudatta Ranasinghe. I am sure this should be true for any HR professional. Also, it is for any leader, manager and administrator.
Life is not only to live but to leave a legacy. Prof. Ranasinghe has aptly done that in his knowledge creating and knowledge sharing life. In order to succeed, people need a sense of self-efficacy, to struggle together with resilience to meet the inevitable obstacles and inequities of life, so said Albert Bandura, the most admired living psychologist of our times. This was evident in the way Prof. Sudatta conducted himself in difficult times.
He had a purpose to live and it was indeed a purpose driven life. His thoughts will spark our minds for a long time. I am proud to be one of his learning partners, a term we prefer to use at the PIM signifying the valued intellectual interaction.
As I firmly believe, the best tribute we can pay for late Prof. Ranasinghe is to have a serving mindset towards deserving humanity. One sure fire way of doing that is to become a paradox navigator in facing the reality and moving ahead with confidence and competence. It will be pertinent to ponder on a serene Sanskrit Shloka that I came across.
Asato Maa Sad-GamayaTamaso Maa Jyotir-GamayaMrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya
Lead us from Unreality to the RealityLead us from the Darkness to the LightLead us from the Fear of Death to the Knowledge of Immortality.
My humble invitation to all you in concluding my first ever memorial oration, is to reflect, refresh and relate in the relished realms of management. As a continuous learner in management, l would express from the bottom of my heart: Good bye my beloved teacher, Prof. Sudatta Wishwamithra Ranasinghe.
Thank you very much for your pleasant and patient participation.

Seventy seven families living in Keeragala group plantation division 2 in Kuruwita have been evacuated from their homes due to a possible landslide threat in the area.
They are accommodated at the Udawatta Community Centre and several homes in the neighbourhood. Cracks have appeared over an area of about 2 acres in the threatened area.
Water spouts had appeared on some of the fissures in the land area concerned.
A resident named R. A. Nalin Sampath said some up rooted boulders had rolled over and seen hanging above the Kataragama Kovil. A stream had also erupted and this had prompted them to move to a safer area. A. Vijayakumara another resident said when they informed the police about the danger they were advised to evacuate the area.
Grama Sevaka of Keeragale Asela Priyantha Gunatillake said two overhanging massive granite rocks in Habaralahena and Agalawatta had posed a landslide threat affecting 77 families.
The National Building Research organisation which examined the region had submitted its report recommending measures to get rid of the rocks.
They had said the two rocks should be safely splintered using chemicals without blasting which would adversely affect the area lying below. Kuruwita Divisional Secretary Dilini Dharmadasa said displaced people are housed in safer locations and they are provided with cooked meals. Volunteer organisations too had come to the assistance of the displaced.

SLs growth to pick up to 4.7%, accelerate to 5.1% -WB
Sri Lankas growth is expected to pick up to about 4.7% in 2017 and accelerate to 5.1% by 2019, as the IMF-supported program helps improve macroeconomic resilience according to a new World Bank report
Reforms initiated by the World Bank Development Policy Operation in 2016 are expected to reduce obstacles to private sector competitiveness in the medium-term and help in attracting FDIs. Resumption of the Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) trading arrangement with the European Union will boost its export sector.
In Sri Lanka, a resumption of Chinese-funded investment and infrastructure projects such as the Colombo International Financial Centre has lifted private investment and FDI inflows; in addition, fiscal consolidation under an IMF program has helped improve investor sentiment.
Regional growth is forecast to increase to 6.8% in 2017 and to strengthen to an average of 7.2% in 2018-19, reflecting a solid expansion of domestic demand and exports Excluding India, regional growth will remain broadly stable at an average of 5.8% in 2017-19, as easing growth in Bangladesh and Nepal offset gains in Bhutan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.
Robust domestic demand, an uptick in exports, and strong foreign direct investment inflows underpin this forecast. Domestic risks to the outlook include policy uncertainty related to upcoming elections and possible setbacks to reform progress. External risks include an increase in global financial volatility, a slowdown in remittances inflows, and rising geopolitical tensions.
The regional forecast assumes that monetary policy across South Asia countries remains broadly accommodative, encouraging credit to the private sector; that fiscal policy tightens slightly to curb the increase in public debt; and that political tensions and insecurity abate.
Indias growth is forecast to increase to 7.2% in FY2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and accelerate to 7.7% by the end of the forecast horizon-slightly below previous projections.
Pakistans growth is expected to increase to 5.2% in FY2017 (July 1, 2016 - June 30, 2017) and remain strong over the forecast horizon, reflecting an upturn in private investment, increased energy supply, and improved security.
Growth in Bangladesh is forecast to remain robust, averaging 6.6% during FY2018-FY2020.

Speaker condoles with House on lives lost due to floods and landslides


Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at the outset of Parliament sessions today expressed the condolences of the House on the lives lost at the recent landslide and flood disasters.
Making a special announcement, the Speaker drew the attention of the House to the need of a well-organized disaster management mechanism in the country to minimize the loss of lives and property damages in any future natural calamity.
The Speaker also recalled with respect the sacrifice made by the air force officer who died during a lifesaving mission.
On behalf of Parliament I extend sincere thanks to tri-force personnel, public servants, local and international organizations, voluntary groups and the media for their selfless support to help the people at the time of the tragedy. It is timely we come up with a suitable disaster management mechanism after a carefully study to face this type of natural calamities. Such effort may cost a large sum of money, but given the international recognition the country has received at present, I am confident we will be able to find foreign funds for the purpose. I call on all the Parliamentarians to join hands in this effort irrespective of party divisions, he said.

Sri Lanka vs Australia- 8th March, 2015
Australia was in a spot of bother as they lost openers David Warner 9 and Aaron Finch17 by the 9th over to be at 41 for 2. Lasith Malingas slower ball did the trick to get Warner out, who played too early and scooped a simple catch to the cover fielder, the marauding Warner walked back to the pavilion and the Sri Lankans were cock a hoop. Seekkuge Prasanna who was playing Division 1 cricket back in Sri Lanka, at that time was summoned to Sydney as a replacement to an injured player, he was selected to play in this match, as Sydney was the only ground in Australia which favored spinners. Mathews brought him to the attack with his leg spin and googly and Prasanna bowled two flighted deliveries to Finch who defensively pushed out, the next ball was a googly pitched on the leg stump and Finch was beaten all ends up down the leg side and Sangakkara did the rest behind the stumps. Smith and Clarke started to repair the damage, Smith as usual took his time to settle playing in the V, Clarke was more adventurous and they put on a 134 run partnership for the third wicket, by now the Australians had got the measure of the Lankan bowlers, Sachitra Senanayake with his remodeled action was a shadow of his former self, he was slower through the air and Clarke with his quick silver footwork was severe on him.
A solid foundation was laid by Smith (72) and Clarke (68) and Australia was 175 for 2 in the 31st over.From then on it was sheer mayhem and the Sydney cricket ground was set a light by Maxwell and Watson who was out of form and favour, but was back in his grove quickly.
Glenn Maxwell at that time was the most ferocious hitter of a cricket ball, and he showed his mettle to the Sydney crowd. He brought up his hundred in fifty balls, it was sad that the Sri Lankan bowlers were at the receiving end. It was significant to note that he was spotting the gaps at will and manufacturing the strokes accordingly to yield the maximum results, his strokes were innovative, cheeky and daring to say the least and had the hall mark of Maxwell at his maximum; his forearms, wrists, shoulders and ankles were rotating in unision to give the ball a thumping whack which catapulted the ball to all corners of the Sydney cricket ground. His balance was akin to a ballet dancer. Watson although over shadowed by Maxwell hammered 67 off 41 deliveries.His innings was studded with 7 fours and 3 sixes. The pair went, hell for leather in the death overs to smash a 160 run fifth wicket partnership to boost the run rate.The carnage was completed by the evergreen Haddin who struck 25 from 9 balls. The Australians clocked 369 for 7 in their 50 overs.
Sri Lanka had the humongous task of scoring that total.
They started their innings as it was a T20 match, Thirimanne was an early casualty, caught behind fending a rising delivery from Johnson. Sri Lanka of course was the masters of that format, they being the current T20 champions then. Dilshan laid into Johnson from the outset, hammering him for four consecutive fours, two past the bowler and two pulled through mid-wicket, the huge contingent of Sri Lankan fans were jubilant. Dilshan was calling the shots and going at a rapid gallop, making the Australian fielders anxious and nervous, there were some misfields around the circle but their boundary riders were outstanding, saving the run bleed by stopping the boundaries.
All of a sudden Sangakkara joined the party, gathered momentum and was thudding the mid-wicket boundary, picking the boundaries with audacious strokeplay and was outpacing Dilshan who was pegged down by Faulkners change of pace, ultimately Dilshan was lbw trying to break the shackles and hitting across the line.
He got 62 sparkling runs. Sangakkara the master batsman that he is showed scant respect to the bowlers by stroking the ball to all corners of the park, to reach his hundred judiciously.
That was his third hundred one after the other however fatigue got the better of him and gave a catch to Finch off the bowling of persevering Faulkner. Mahela Jayawardene did not last long trying to rotate the strike too often went for a suicidal run and paid the price.
Mathews was joined by Dinesh Chandimal who was given the green light at long last by the selectors, after getting some shabby treatment from them, by relieving him of his T20 captaincy for no reason at all.
Chandimal let the bat do the talking by getting a quick fire 50 in a mere 22 balls, his innings was studded with well-placed and well-timed boundaries. Doherty was at the receiving end of Chandimal, an exquisite drive of him was a peach of a shot which whistled to the boundary like the whispering wind. However he was hampered by a hamstring injury, and an eager run chase was cut short, it was the 42nd over. When Chandimal and Mathews who was muscling his shots were going great guns, the light at the end of the tunnel was not far away, but it faded away when Tissara Perera could not keep up the momentum getting out caught by Johnson bowled Doherty for 8.
Mathews was left with the tail and knew it was too tall an order and threw the towel, when he was 35. Sri Lanka ended up at 312 for 9 in the 46th over which was a pity.
There was no point in sending Upul Tharanga at the death because he did not have the big shots, finishing and playing the full quota of overs should have been a good lesson for the Sri Lankan late order batsmen.
Sri Lanka in the final analysis gave as good as they got and thrilled the huge Sri Lankan contingent who were witnessing the proceedings with glee.
The Man of the match was that man Glen Maxwell.

With the stalker within
Stalker is a forbidding word. So is racist, which is even creepier. And Panther is no exception, of course. One writer is nevertheless in a buoyant mood with these three: stalker, racist and panther.
That is none other than Chhimi Tendu-La - half English, half Tibetan - who grew up in Hong Kong, London, Delhi and finally Colombo, where he now lives with his wife, Samantha, and daughter, Tara. The Amazing Racist, his first novel, was released in January 2015 by Hachette India. His second novel, Panther, was released by HarperCollins India early in 2015. And his latest, Loyal Stalkers is now available in the leading bookshops.
Whatever it is, Chhimi Tenduf-La is yet to bear the brunt of any such criticism.
How can a racist be amazing How can a stalker be loyal How can a panther roam alone without instilling fear in the surrounding They are but a creepy species, best let alone to their own devices.
But Tenduf-La has to bank on them to enter Sri Lankas literary hedgerow. Although much feeble in strength to exist, the literature industry of this country makes a commendable attempt to reach some destination. Not without debates and conflicts though.
The local writers share a conflict of interest with the expatriate writers. The latter have no firm footing to write about the country, the local critiques point out. First, most such writers, though born in the country, had stayed away from the country for so long and their idea about the landscape is far from reality. Second, they do not belong to the roots of the cultural landscape.
All the same both groups struggle for a placement in the world book market.
First time I tried to write I had no idea what I had to do and what the techniques were. I bought a number of books about writing (which I can look up and add the piece if need be). Still, I found it hard to judge my own writing so I looked online for a literary consultancy,
That was a costly enterprise, though Tenduf-La chose to see the sunny side. He will receive feedback for his novel.
The feedback was positive but ultimately I could not bring that particular book together. But learning so much from doing it and in fact have stolen characters and scenes from it for my subsequent novels and short stories.
Following his experience in authoring Amazing Racist and Panther, Tenduf-La decided to write to an Indian agent. The Google results directed him to Kanishka Gupta who turned out to be the best in India.
He said he liked my writing but that my book needed further work. He has a team of editors and assigned one to me who made me draw out the book up to 65k words with more character development.
When he was happy with it, Kanishka sent it out to many publishers. Three of them made offers as well as counter offers.
While we waited for Amazing Racist to come out, Kanishka asked me if I had anything else and I sent him Panther, a Young Adult novel which again required extra work after which he sent it out and I got a few offers.
When Tenduf-La sent Loyal Stalkers, he secured a few more offers, much better than for his first two books. Pan Macmillan India made him work hard on the edits. Two different expert editors worked through drafts. After releasing in South Asia they will try to sell the rights on to publishing houses in the West.
Indian publishers are actively looking for Sri Lankan writers. It is a tough market to crack, but I am learning the ropes. You need to engage with bloggers and try to get storefront prominence. It is a superb learning experience working with such massive publishers and I now feel I am in a position to help people get published. However, I am personally reluctant to read or comment on peoples unpublished work as there is always a chance that similarities in future books can garner plagiarism accusations.
But people really do have to get others to read their work and point them in the right direction. Tenduf-La also entered a site called YouWriteOn which was superb for that. You put up between 5000-7000 words of your writing and other aspiring writers critique it in return for your views on their books. They have a chart and if you get into the top five, then a publisher gives feedback too which happened with me.
The best thing about Loyal Stalkers is its library of people. Wonderfully crafted characters that walk in singularly with their stories and then reappear perhaps as a face in the crowd gathered around a road accident, a person working out on the next treadmill or a guy who walks in with his son to buy a swanky birthday treat he can hardly afford, writes Jhinuk Sen to www.catchnews.com.
In some cases, I just Googled true stories in other countries and then mashed up a few of these things into a Sri Lankan setting. Mostly though, I started with a character, like a gym instructor, based on someone I know and then I built a story around him. I also always wanted to write about a stalker from his point of view  which has been done before. Where this is different is the victim never knows she is being stalked.
Like other Asian countries, there is a lot that happens here that is not spoken about. This is what the first story that you explore in Loyal Stalkers.
Avoiding shame to a generation of Sri Lankans is more important than anything else. Right now people in some areas have been devastated by floods and the outpouring of generosity is immense. Supermarket shelves are empty because people have gone out and spent all their money on rations for the people affected. Yet it has not escaped peoples notice that it takes.
Setting off with a racist, continuing on with a panther and stalkers what will be Tenduf-Las next destination
I started a crime thriller which was so creepy I started getting scared of my own reflection. I have put that on hold because I am quite busy annoying people into buying Loyal Stalkers. Its not a bad time to take stock and see how things go so I can decide whether to flesh this story into a novel or do another collection of linked short stories.
For the time being, be sternly advised: the protagonist of Loyal Stalkers is scary  yes, pretty much, albeit with an adorable characteristic or two. That was simply because such characterisation is Tenduf-Las home turf.
We all make mistakes; we all have reasons for the bad things we may have done and in this book, I hope one story may explain the characters mistakes in another. Sure, none of us has broken into a house and slept under someones bed without them knowing, but the guy is also incredibly loyal, loving and protective, Tenduf-La remarks.
In a private room sheltered from the Colombo riots, a seventeen-year-old girl gives birth to a hatechild. At a modern city gym, an introverted fitness instructor obsesses over his unattainable client. Inside an untended guest-house room, an adolescent cricket champ is caught unawares by his coachs violent fury. By a rain-drenched gravesite, a special-needs teacher confides in a stranger.
Edgy yet tender, racy yet warm, these interlinked stories take us into the unfamiliar everyday of Sri Lankan living, where smugglers, waiters, single moms and cheaters cross paths as they attempt to negotiate a web of shock, subterfuge and irony. A collection of infinite brio and charm, this is Chhimi Tenduf-La at his inventive best.

Stigmata : A force to metal with
With the advent of Stigmata two important things happened. It gave hope to the band members and more importantly it gave hope to Sri Lanka's music fans. Stigmata became a rallying point due to the incredible vision of its founders; Suresh De Silva and Tennyson Napoleon. It gathered a group of followers that believed in the bands music as much as the band members believed in the music they made. Daily News speaks to Band Leader of Stigmata Suresh De Silva and under his leadership Stigmata has touched lives through the power of its music.
What we do is called Pure Sri Lankan Metal, that is the brand name for the music that we make. But if you break down the blue print of what we do, it's fundamentally Heavy Metal and Hard Rock music, although we incorporate multifarious elements of Jazz, Baila, Fusion, Funk, Progressive Rock, Delta Blues, Power, Thrash & Death Metal, Folk and even Classical music. We have a very heavy eastern sound and we are the only Heavy Metal Band across the spectrum to utilize Baila, although we do incorporate Eastern rhythms and 'Wannam' and 'Pappara based stuff. So it is a very holistic formula. Some of the parts that make it a whole are different genres of music. But essentially we are a proud and loud Heavy Metal band, but it is Pure Sri Lankan Metal because the style and genre of what we do, our own formula cannot be found in any part of the world, said Suresh.
The band was formed initially by Suresh and Tennyson, then Andrew Obeysekere (but he recently left) joined to form the nucleus of the ensemble.
As the founders, we kept the band rolling for a long period of time. But we have had a lot of serious issues during the last couple of years, from mismanagement from my part to the unit as a collective lacking the drive and motivation to steer the vessel out of stormy seas as it were, a Band is a family and a team, if everyone lacks the same vision and spirit of motivation then it cannot progress and evolve further. The last couple of years have been a very tough time for us as we got played out by a tour promoter in New Zealand and there were problems where certain corporate conglomerates locally acted unprofessionally pertaining to sponsorship agreements which affected our last album launch and the cycle that followed. Tenny and I ended up in a situation where the two of us were left on our own to tackle all of the issues and to resolve the aforesaid problems a day at a time. 2017 has been a true period that has tested our endurance and faith in what we do, but thanks to the stringent support we received from our fans, families and a handful of our friends, we were able to literally rise from the ashes.
When certain members of the band began to not find fulfillment playing our kind of music, when music becomes a monetary endeavor as opposed to an artistic one - then it becomes difficult to share a common vision.
Being in a band in this time & age is not an easy role, it is really hard. Stigmata is not our bread and butter, it is our lifes passion. We all have professional vocations and we established early on that the music we create in Stigmata is not a commercial venture to seek fame and fortune. It is not something we do for mass appeal or to make money. I know it sounds clich saying we dont do music for money but with us it is the truth. We do it for artistic value, stated Suresh, stated Suresh.
This year is their 17th year of creating music.
In terms of playing original music, we are the first Heavy Metal and Rock band in Sri Lanka to have persevered and endured like we have. We have four albums out. A number of EPs and even 1 DVD. We have released a myriad of singles and have been blessed to tour around the world at many festivals in Australia, Dubai, India, Malaysia, Maldives, New Zealand and Bangladesh. We have had our albums picked as year end favorites with our last one "The Ascetic Paradox" receiving global acclaim in the US, France, UK, Italy, Middle East and over Asia.
If everybody does not share the same collective vision, it can be very difficult. This is not me casting stones at anyone who is not in the band anymore, but there were a lot of issues that made us disintegrate as individuals and who and what we were to each other. I realized that the state of the Band and the divisions forming plunged me into a very dark and perturbing place. I believe I hit an all- time low and a level of depression that made me very volatile and abrasive during the last few performances. You must understand that for Tenny and myself Stigmata is more than a therapeutic sanctuary.
Tenny and I never lost focus. We never lost the focal point of what Stigmata means to us and what we wanted to achieve. Tenny and I, as the chief songwriters of the band have been chiseling and churning out some amazing new music that we hope to share with our fans soon. As the foundation/pillars of the band we need to ensure that we have the right people involved. Not just talented players, but reliable, honest and down to earth people that are committed and psyched like we are to create new music," explained Suresh.
Suresh feels that we are living in very difficult and tough times in the music industry.
The entire infrastructure has changed with technology. Artists are finding it very difficult to survive in order to make this a commercially lucrative endeavor. There are artists in the world out there that have made it really big, like Metallica, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and Guns & Roses - but they made their mark in a different time, a different era entirely. But you have to understand that Stigmata is not a mainstream band. We have never conceived music for mass appeal. We would rather be a Picasso on someones wall, than be a Coca Cola in everyones fridge, explained Suresh.
Suresh emphasizes and stresses that for them their music, message, the lyrics and evolutionary standpoint and artistic integrity means much more than making money.
What's important is that Tenny and I have not lost that spark and fire. We are still as excited as we were 17 years ago to create new crushing music. We have carved a legacy of Stigmata that we believe in. For better or for worse we have become a part of the fabric of Sri Lankan Arts and Culture. We were featured on the BBC on the Daily Arts Show last year which has 56 million listeners. We were not given any publicity here locally because we are not a mainstream act. I dont think there are too many artists in Sri Lanka that can say they have been featured on the BBC and we are also the only Asian based band to be featured on the Discovery Channel twice. We have performed for a full house at the prestigious Forum Theater at the Melbourne Arts Festival and played for 300 people at Clubs and Pubs overseas while performing for close to 40,000 at the famous Dhaka Army Stadium in Bangladesh. We take great stock in getting our nation recognized for powerful and evocative music and we will spread our unique brand of organized chaos wherever they welcome us.
Suresh works as the English Creative Writer at Q & E Advertising while Tenny who is married and has a beautiful baby boy is the Art Director at JGSW.
Despite all our responsibilities and everything we have to be accountable for, all our priorities and obligations we still find time for Stigmata. This is more than our therapy and sanctuary. The moment music or art becomes a cash cow endeavor sometimes it can lose its magic. With all our hard work we believe Stigmata can preserve its dignity and integrity, and we ensured that, without having to compromise our art, music, image and our musical direction, informed Suresh.
Music means different things to different people. Look at the world today, look at the Manchester bombing. Absolutely senseless. Mostly children affected. Look at the floods and landslides in this country. You'd think after a year necessary precautions would have been taken to anticipate another catastrophic episode. Look at the indirect racism that is springing up. Pitting one set of people against the other. We are really living in hard and dark times. Music is something that can make people laugh, cry or smile. Music can be sensual. Music can make people angry and make them think of issues.
Regardless of race, religion, creed, personality or so called heritage, all those things cease to matter, when it comes to music. Music should bring people together. So my message is forget about being Burgher, Muslim, Sinhala or Tamil, think about being Sri Lankans. Think about being human and being united -that is the power of music. We have so many evocative themes. We have dealt with everything from war and social degradation to economic strife, personal and emotional loss, psychological paralysis, spiritual pain to the human condition. We have dealt with life and death, and apathy and indifference. Whatever it is we like to offer a platform for people, not just to be at peace but to feel liberated. And also so they can really get something out of it. People are really passionate about the message and the music while others appreciate just one or the other. At the end of the day as long as it is therapeutic and it touches people and triggers a reaction that is fine, summed up Suresh.
Stigmata will give an exclusive performance at this years Comicon on August 26 at the S.L.E.C.C

Warner says no contracts, cant play in CA dig
Sydney: Vice-captain David Warner has attacked Cricket Australia's handling of a pay dispute and once again raised the spectre of an Ashes series boycott by players later this year.
The feisty opener has not backed away from claims he made last month of a potential players' strike during the showpiece home series against England, starting in November.
CA has threatened not to pay contracted players beyond the June 30 expiry of their current financial deal if they do not accept a new offer.
But Warner has gone on the front foot, claiming the governing body had prosecuted its argument primarily through media briefings.
"If we are unemployed, we have no contracts, we can't play," he told Fairfax Media Monday in England at the Champions Trophy.
"We are pretty sure that they will come to an agreement. But, as you know, we are going to be unemployed come July 1. So we have to wait and see."
Warner said beyond "a couple of emails" CA management had not engaged with its contracted players.
"It is only what we hear in the media and that's how CA have been driving it the whole way," he said.
"They have been using the media as a voice and we get the message from there."
Warner again pledged his "full support" to fellow players and affirmed he is "100 percent" behind the Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA).
"They are doing a great job for us," he said of the players' union's efforts in the dispute.
"From a players' point of view, we are pretty vocal and upbeat."
Warner added that he remains hopeful a new Memorandum of Understanding can be struck between now and June 30.
"It is a big thing that we could be unemployed, but from us, our job is to play cricket, focus on winning the (Champions Trophy) tournament and not let our country down," he said. AFP

Wonder Woman : of Amazonian princesses
W onder Woman the much awaited Superhero Hollywood movie commenced screening at the fully refurbished Liberty cinema from June 2 parallel to its worldwide premier in the United States.
The enthralling movie based on the 1941 DC Comics character brings to fore the divine and compassionate demigoddess called Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman who has brains, sensuality and who is destined to fight against evil.
The movie is directed by Patty Jenkins and Wonder Womanis played by Gal Gadot.
Wonder Woman is the first summer tent pole superhero film directed by a woman, and Jenkins is the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist.
Wonder Woman is also the first full-length feature film based on the character, following her first appearance in 2016s Batman v Superman.
Wonder Woman's origin story in DC comics relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother and given life by Aphrodite along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek Gods.
However, in recent years artists updated her profile and Diana, the princess of Amazons has been depicted as the daughter of Zeus, and jointly raised by her mother Hippolyta and her aunts Antiope and Menalippe, on the sheltered island paradise called Themyscira. There she was groomed to be an unconquerable warrior.
Movie synopsis
In this 2017 movie Diana meets an American pilot Steve Trevor who comes out of the blues and tells her about the massive conflict that's raging in the outside world. Convinced that she can stop the threat, Diana leaves her home for the first time.
The war brings her face-to-face with Ares, the evil son of Zeus who happens to be her brother. Fighting alongside men in a war to end all wars, she finally discovers her full powers and true destiny. With her weapon The lasso of Truth and superhuman strength to perform hand-to-hand combat, she vanquishes enemies while experiencing sorrows of war.
Alongside Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Chris Pine of Star Trek fame plays US military pilot Steve Trevor.
Also joining the bandwagon to provide unstoppable entertainment are Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Robin Wright as General Antiope, the sister of Hippolyta and Diana's aunt, Danny Huston as General Erich Ludendorff, an ambitious and iron fisted general of the German Army during World War I, David Thewlis as Ares, the treacherous son of Zeus based on the Greek mythological god of War and Elena Anaya as Doctor Maru aka Doctor Poison, a mad female scientist who is associated with General Ludendorff and specializes in chemistry such as poisons.
True believers
Wonder Woman is not only made for true believers who read DC comics but for all cinema lovers who seek for adventurous escapism. Director of the film Patty Jenkins and the screenplay writers Allan Heinberg, Geoff Johns and Patty Jenkins have carefully associated with all attributes of the character in the comic books, evolved for decades.
Wonder Woman in DC comics is projected as having a bisexual persona. She has a passive approach towards nudity and thinks the need for men only arises in reproduction. When it comes to pleasures of the skin, men are not mandatory, once she tells her companion American pilot Steve Trevor. However with his above average skills in sexuality, Trevor entices her to dance with him in a romantic atmosphere that leads to one night stand.
Skyline Entertainment and Consultancy Pvt Ltd, a leading distributor of Hollywood films in Sri Lanka in association with Liberty by Scope Cinemas, presents the premier of Wonder Woman for the Sri Lanka market.
Skyline Entertainment and Consultancy Pvt Ltd is the market leader for English film distribution in the Sri Lanka market with an aim to revamp the film industry.

The minister instructed the authorities to restore the historic cave after he inspected the site during his tour of Kalutara.
The Pahiyangala is so named after Chinese Buddhist monk Fa Hien, who, according to historical records, travelled by foot from China to India, visiting Buddhist sites in Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka in the early fifth century (between 399-412).
He is said to have journeyed these countries to acquire Buddhist scriptures of the Vinaya Pitaka.

## Title: Arantalawa

Arantalawa
The horrendous massacre of a group of novice Bikkhus at Arantalawa by the LTTE exactly three decades ago has all but faded from the memory of the local populous in typical Sri Lankan fashion. Over 30 Samaneras were brutally hacked and butchered to death by a band of blood thirsty terrorists while travelling in a bus to partake of a dana at another temple.
Former civil servant Austin Fernando now Governor of the Eastern Province who was called upon to deal with the disturbing aftermath of the gruesome episode recounted his experience in an article in an English daily on Friday (June 2) to mark 30 years of the tragedy. In chilling detail he recounted the horror he encountered at the scene where the bodies were laid out and how he only barely succeeded in preventing the inevitable backlash on the Tamils living in the Ampara town.
This perhaps was the single incident anywhere in the world in known history where members of the clergy were singled out for massacre and in such bestial manner (some of the novice monks were as young as 8 years). There was no international outcry at the time against this mind boggling crime while human rights organisations such as Amnesty International were conspicuous by their silence. Worse, the self appointed local patriots who now make a big hue and cry about the arrest of Buddhist monks did not so much as care to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Arantalwa massacre at a time the great patriot of them all was at the helm of affairs. On the contrary, the individual whose hands were bloodied by the mass massacre of Buddhist monks was rewarded with ministerial office and made a vice president of the political party of the great patriot .What is more, this worthy was seen at the Galle Face May Day rally the other day singing the praises of his benefactor.
It is not the just the monks. Innocent villagers, who formed a buffer against the rest were mercilessly butchered with even pregnant mothers, and suckling infants not spared. Like Governor Fernando said only a very few ventured out to these vulnerable villages to provide solace to these hapless beings who were sitting ducks to terror strikes, among them Ravi Jayewardene, S.L. Gunasekera, Dr. A.T. Ariyaratne. One cannot recall any member of the National Movement Against Terrorism (NMAT) who are today holding media conferences ad nauseam on alleged unpatriotic and unBudhhist acts of the government ever going to the assistance of these villagers at their time of peril. Where were the likes of Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera when the Sri Dalada Maligawa was bombed and why was no investigation demanded into the Arantalawa massacre and the gunning down in cold blood 600 policemen in the East Was it because those responsible for these acts were in the bosom of their leader Why are people like Udaya Gammanpila and Wimal Weerawansa silent on Arantalawa They certainly could have made ample political capital out of the massacre of the Buddhist monks with the incident taking place under a UNP government. Were they embarrassed to rake up the matter for obvious reasons
True, reconciliation demands the burying of the past and starting anew. But it must also be ensured that whatever mechanism that is being contemplated in regard to transitional justice and reparation, the above atrocities committed by the LTTE too be taken into account. A Truth Commission has to be just that. Laying down things just as they happened. There cannot be one way traffic. The crimes committed by both sides should be documented and the truth arrived at if justice is to be meted out in an even handed manner.
President Sirisenas attendance at the Arantalawa Memorial to pay tribute to the slain monks at the 30th year commemoration of Arantalawa is a clear indication that although there is a will to forgive in the name of reconciliation there is no way such atrocities could be forgotten.
The best and the worst
The flood disaster and its aftermath, while no doubt bringing the best out of most Sri Lankans who rushed to the assistance of victims have also exposed the other side of the picture where elements bent on exploiting the situation are making hay. We say this because in most areas today, flood relief collecting centres have mushroomed overnight with some even erecting make shift shelters in street corners to collect flood relief. Of course one could argue that anything will be welcome at present to alleviate the condition of the victims, whatever the means adopted, given the gravity of the situation. It could also be said that not all these collecting centres are phony and that the relief collected will go to the right destinations. However the public cannot be faulted for entertaining suspicions, given the past experience where relief collected at times of national calamities found their way to the homes of the collectors which even included local politicians. Hence steps should be taken by the authorities to look into this aspect.

Bid to resist any tryst with a lift!
I hate lifts. I know they are a convenient source of mobility when you consider the ups and downs of their use in high rises. And particularly so when they save you a heck of lot of thigh ache while ascending mountainous stairways.
But I have a considerable phobia of them. I always look around before I enter one. Are there stairs I have encountered a few high-rise buildings in my time that had constrained me to take the lift because the stairs were alarmed fire exits!
You see, I am claustrophobic. And I am terrified for a number of reasons of stepping into an air-tight metal box the size of a luxury toilet cubicle, which is devoid of a loo when you become stuck and incontinent with stark fright and lose control of your bladder.
And so would any rational person when you realise you are pulled hundreds of feet from the ground by a cable, which if it snapped and the brakes failed would send you plummeting to your death, even if you jumped just as the darned contraption hit the ground.
You may imagine my fears are irrational. But ask a thousand others who share my anxiety about a lift going kaput and you will be assailed by the same petrifying expressions of dread. For any unimaginative moron calling a lift is run-of-the-mill stuff. Its easy. Simply press the button and wait. And once inside then press the button again.
But experience has taught me that all lifts are not what one would call equal. For instance, I once edited a story for a Hong Kong newspaper of a woman who stepped into an old defective lift, or rather a lift that was not, without keeping her eyes peeled. The light indicated it was on her floor, the doors opened and she stepped into fourth floor space. The poor woman was injured but fortunately survived the involuntary plunge only because the device had stopped on the floor directly below.
As in the case of many others I am always impatient while waiting for a lift. I am a firm believer that many lifts work on the pressure you exert on the call button. So punching it a 100 times will make it arrive a lot faster. Before you get into the lift, its as well to check whether it has actually arrived or going up or down. Theres nothing more embarrassing than saying confidently to a packed lift Ground floor please and then feeling the lift rocketing upwards.
In addition to my phobia I must concede that lift faux pas can also be terribly embarrassing. I once worked on the fifth floor of a 24-floor office building in Singapore for a publishing company. It was my second week at work and I was going home at the end of a long day. And instead of looking at the light to confirm that the lift was actually headed in a downward direction, I just got on as soon as the doors opened, assuming it was going down.
Naturally, I was wrong. I rode up to the sixth floor. When the doors opened, the president of the company was standing there, waiting to get on. I recognised the crusty old tyrant from his picture in a previous issue of the firms business magazine.
I was so surprised that I didnt even have the presence of mind to jump out as though I had actually intended to get off on the executive floor. I just stood there like a nitwit. And as the doors closed and we rode down, he said to me: Are you just joy riding on the lift, or what
To which I replied, inaudibly, Uh, unintentionally, yes, sounding remarkably like Butthead, when hes trying to figure something out. The president said nothing. He looked like he wondered who I was and if there was any way he could conveniently fire me. Fortunately, he never found out who I was.
I was once late for an appointment and hurried up an escalator, which we all know is a vertical transportation device in the form of a moving staircase  a conveyor which carries people between floors of a building. It consisted of a motor-driven chain of individually linked steps to reach the lift of a high rise.
I dashed up the moving steps to the annoyance of several passengers serenely riding the stairway on its uppity-uppity ascent. The planets were aligned, as long as I kept my footing I would arrive at my appointment on time. I tore up the moving stairwell uncommonly nimble given my various physical inadequacies, flung myself up the stairs two steps at a time, and reached the lift. I was the only person there. I hit the lift call button. Then I hit it again. And a third time just in case. The lift descended and the doors opened. I stepped inside, triumphant, and hit the up button. I faced the doors and watched them close slowly, the merest sliver of a chink of light showing through.
Then the doors opened again. It was a man, who had clearly been, if not hot, lukewarm on my heels. He had stopped me. I still hate him now. Never mind, I thought. I stabbed the up button again. But somebody shouted, Hang on! Another middle-aged man dashed through the closing doors and hit the open doors button. He stuck his head through and called, Its all right, Mum, Ive got it.
I knew which way this was going. By the time the fat mum of this middle-aged moron had appeared at the lifts threshold, another horde of humanity was at the door. And in they poured, dozens of people, 20 or so of them together in some sort of work outing. I assume it was a convention outing - they were all wearing name badges and it did not look like a hen party, although it sounded like one.
Finally the doors closed. And we waited. And waited. Two minutes passed and the doors did not reopen. Brilliant, I thought, Were trapped. I surveyed the throng and tried to work out who we would eat first. Any more of the chatter and I would have volunteered myself.
Has anybody pressed the open doors button I asked, from under a strangers armpit. Oooh, said somebody, who presumably pressed the button. The doors opened. We were still on the ground floor. There were twenty-eight people in that lift, and not one of them had thought to press the up button.
Scuse me, I said. This is my floor. And I pushed through the crowd back into the lobby. Sometimes you just have to be late for an appointment, I thought, as I waited for the next lift.

BOC represents SL at Belt and Road Bankers Roundtable
Bank of Ceylons Chairman, Presidents Counsel Ronald C. Perera joined the Belt and Road Initiatives - Bankers Roundtable held recently in Beijing, China.
He was the only Sri Lankan participant at this summit. The Bankers Roundtable was conducted in line with the Belt and Road Initiative forum that took place on May 15, 2017, in China.
The event was hosted by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). With the banks strong ties with many of these international banks and the importance of its role in the Sri Lankan banking industry, Bank of Ceylon was invited to represent the country at this forum and was able to further strengthen its ties and collaboration with these international banking giants such as ICBC, Asian Development Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, Citibank, Bank of China, J.P. Morgan and Chase, Habib Bank Pakistan, and many other leading foreign banks.

Presidents Counsel Perera spoke of the history of cooperation between China and Sri Lanka which spread over a 1,000 years and also the present Chinese investment in Sri Lanka setting out the importance of Sri Lanka as a maritime and economic hub in the Indian Ocean.
Stating that the Indian Ocean remains the key to Asian prosperity, he said that the Indian Ocean envisages at its core, an ocean free of conflict, despite competing economic interest, with lanes of comfort, ease and safety of passage, freedom of navigation, and secure and sustainable use of resources for economic advancement of states in an equitable manner.
He said in order to fully tap this potential the Government of Sri Lanka will engage in initiatives with China and regional players who have major economic stakes in the Indian Ocean.
Bank of Ceylon will continue to cooperate with GOSL to implement various development projects to facilitate and enhance the operation of the country as a maritime and an economic hub in the Indian Ocean and will participate in projects brought by Belt and Road Initiatives, he said.
The BOC Chairman was also interviewed by Chinese television about his thoughts on opportunities that Belt and Road Initiatives can bring to Sri Lanka and China in their joint efforts for cooperation.
The initiative looks into key areas: cultural exchanges, policy coordination, facilitating connectivity, financial integration, trade, investment and infrastructure development. The motive of the Bankers Forum was to discuss the boosting of their presence under the Belt and Road Initiatives and to seek closer partnerships for project financing.

Bogollagama wants Govt.to re-examine its ties with Qatar
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Rohitha Bogollogama yesterday told the Daily News that Sri Lanka should re-examine its diplomatic relations with Qatar after Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen cut ties with the country over its alleged backing of militant groups such as the Islamic State (ISIS) and al-Qaeda.
We should not automatically cut ties with any friendly country if other countries do, but we should examine the reasons these five countries are severing ties with Qatar.
If the government finds that the reasons for cutting ties are valid, and if it believes that this action will counter terrorism, then it is an opportunity for Sri Lanka to take up a position against the spread of terrorism in the international arena, Bogollogama said.
He added that any decision should be made objectively by analyzing the facts of the situation. Furthermore, he argued that, since Sri Lanka has so much experience fighting terrorism, it has a moral duty to fight the scourge throughout the world.
When I was Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sri Lanka was one of the key countries battling terrorism. We dealt with terrorism for 30 long years, so we should highlight our stance that terrorism must be destroyed, he said.
The former Minister also touched on the importance of Sri Lankas involvement in world affairs, as he noted that, if it is warranted, such an action would demonstrate to the European Union, United States, United Kingdom, and Canada that the island is serious about countering the threat of international terrorism.
Theres no other upcoming opportunity for Sri Lanka to play a role in global affairs. If Sri Lanka does not take a position on these issues, it will never have an opportunity to take positions on a lot of other issues as well, he said.

Cardiff braces for New Zealand-England thriller
CARDIFF: Despite having had to make do with just one point from its rain-ruined opening game against Australia, New Zealand will approach its clash against England with enhanced confidence writes former fast bowler Shane Bond. Kane Williamson and his boys will perhaps feel they were denied a point at Edgbaston by the weather, but thats done and dusted. They will, however, take a great deal of heart from the manner in which they competed against Australia, traditionally tough nuts to crack for New Zealand in neutral territory.
Before Fridays washout, New Zealand had lost 18 of its last 19 clashes, since 1999, to Australia on neutral patch. To have, therefore, held its own in its opening Group A encounter will be a huge confidence-booster for the Black Caps. I will be at the Cardiff Wales Stadium to watch the action first-hand, and I am really excited at what lies ahead.
In some respects, this is almost like a quarterfinal, the Birmingham no-result throwing a spanner in the works a little bit. Especially in the last two years, despite Englands vastly different approach to white-ball cricket, games between the two teams have been very tight, and I expect another close, well-contested encounter.
Chris Woakes being ruled out of the tournament will be a very big loss for the home side. As a cricketer, it is these events that you train and prepare so hard for, and when your tournament ends after just two overs, like it did for Woakes, it can be a bitter pill to swallow. Woakes has been a vital cog in the England wheel for the last one year in both Test cricket and the 50-over format. I feel for him, but thats how the game goes sometimes. As someone who has had his fair share of injuries, all I can tell him is to stay positive and look at this as a temporary blip, because it wont help anyone if his mindset is otherwise.
New Zealand will have taken note of a few things from Englands opening win against Bangladesh. For starters, Jason Roy has been struggling for form, and is coming off a string of low scores. If New Zealand can get stuck in early on and pick up a couple of quick wickets, then even Englands heavy-hitters can feel the pressure.
The Cardiff strip will also be of interest, and I wont be surprised if New Zealand changes things up a bit and considers someone like Jeetan Patel. The off-spinner is no stranger to conditions, having played county cricket so long and quite successfully, and if the wicket is slow, then there is the opportunity to back up Mitchell Santners left-arm spin with Jeetans off-spin.
For England, who will fill the boots of Woakes is the big question. Personally, I would go with Adil Rashid. I think playing the leggie in 50-over cricket is a great option, a leg-spinner is just a different type of bowler. Particularly in Twenty20 cricket in the recent past, leggies have had plenty of success through the middle overs, and to see Rashid back in the XI in place of Woakes wouldnt surprise me at all.
Both teams match-up in similar vein  there is a lot of power-hitting, plenty of all-rounders and good fast bowlers through the line-up. New Zealand, like weve said previously, hasnt picked a leg-spinner in its squad -- I think it should have  and with Rashid not playing in the last game, both sides have left the attacking spinner on the sidelines. England, at least, has the chance to rectify that in its next outing.
In some ways, despite its eventually comfortable win against Bangladesh, it was a pretty nervous start by England. Both the teams were feeling their way in the first game, not really knowing what to expect. Bangladesh came very hard at the top and hit out at England, and thats something New Zealand has been doing, too. They throw their bats around at the top of the innings and catch the opposition off guard. If they can get off to another cracker through Martin Guptill and Luke Ronchi, then all the pressure of the world will be on the home side.
England knows that if it gets past New Zealand, it will as good as eliminate the Kiwis and clear one obstacle on its path to the semifinal. In saying that, the deeper we get into the tournament, the higher the pressure and the expectations on the home side.
Had New Zealand lost to Australia, say, it could have come down to net run-rate, but the one point from that game has kept the group wide open. England has two big guns to come in the shape of New Zealand and then Australia, it is all about how it handles the pressure.
England will really want to win this game because its final league opponent is Australia. In a tournament like this where every game is tough and competitive, you dont want to leave your qualification hanging in the balance going into the last game. Especially if that last game is against Australia. That will be the underlying pressure for the host, and New Zealand would do well to try and make the most of that.

CB refused information on secondary bond market transactions: Harsha
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has failed to provide information on secondary bond market transactions despite several requests made by the second COPE committee that inquired into the Treasury bond issue, Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva yesterday said. Dr. de Silva said so, while testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday. When the COPE committee requested information on the secondary bond market transactions, the Central Bank told us that they did not have information regarding it, Dr. de Silva said. We wanted to follow the trail of the treasury bonds sold in the primary market. Since we did not receive this information, we were not able to proceed with the COPE committees investigation regarding secondary bond market transactions. This is the reason why we have demanded for a forensic audit done on the secondary bond market from 2008 onwards. Dr. de Silva pointed out.
Replying to a question directed by Commissioner, Supreme Court Justice P.S. Jayawardena, Dr. de Silva said the COPE committee requested for this information in late 2016. We made these requests not just once but on several occasions, he said.
Dr. de Silva also said that, as far as he recalls, the COPE committee forwarded this request to both former Governor Arjun Mahendran and the present Governor Dr. Coomaraswamy. It was pointed out at the Commission that the Central Bank in fact had these requested details in their Central Depositary System.
Dr. de Silva was again made aware by the Commission that the Central Bank indeed had this information in possession.
Justice Jayawardena asked Dr. de Silva if he is aware that the first COPE committee requested for the same information from the Central Bank, to which Dr.de Silva said he is not aware of such a case.
Meanwhile, Dr. de Silva was examined by Senior State Council Dr. Avanti Perera, regarding a telephone call he received on February 27 2015, the day on which the questioned auction took place. Dr. Perera questioned if Dr. de Silva received a telephone call from a Primary Dealer regarding the questioned auction to which Dr. de Silva said replied that he did receive an informal complain from a Primary Dealer saying that something fishy is going on at the Treasury bond auction held on that day.
Asked as to what he did following this conversation, Dr. de Silva said he contacted former Governor Arjun Mahendran and alerted him on the concerns expressed.
I met Mahendran in the evening and raised the same concerns. Mahendran told me that he also has received the information, and that he does not think there would be any issue, Dr. de Silva said.
Senior State Council Dr. Avanti Perera then read out certain portions of statements made by Dr. Harsha de Silva at the COPE committee proceedings and requested to confirm if he had made those comments. Dr. de Silva answered in affirmative when Perera read out the statements. Dr. Avanti Perera read out the following statements which were in Sinhala.
Dr. Perera: (reads out from the first statement) I quote, this person, is accused of shady transactions in the financial market even before his father-in-law became the Governor of the Central Bank. Who do you refer to as this person
Dr. Harsha de Silva: Mr. Arjun Aloysius.
Dr. Perera: of the Perpetual Treasuries Limited
Dr. Harsha de Silva: Yes.
Justice Jayawarden: Who do you refer to as the Governor of the Central Bank
Dr.Harsha de Silva: Mr. Arjun Mahendran.
Dr. Perera: (reads out from the next statement) I quote what I want to point out is that, we cannot reach a conclusion that the whole transaction was based on this father-in-law and son-in-law relationship because this person has been involved in things like these for a long time. He must have received insider information from somewhere. So who do you refer to as he
Dr. Harsha de Silva: Mr. Arjun Aloysius. Dr. Perera: (reads out the last statement) I quote there must be more people involved in this. This is a transaction running beyond the relationship of a son-in-law and a father-in-law. Can you confirm this is what you said

Even in the year 2017, the representation of women in the films screened at a platform as reputed as the Cannes Film Festival is shockingly disturbing, and Jessica Chastain, who was one of the jury members at the festival did not hesitate to point it out. JustJared.com reports that during a press conference after the closing ceremony, the Oscar-nominated actress said, This is the first time I watched 20 films in 10 days, and I love movies, and the one thing I really took away from this experience is how the world views women.
It was quite disturbing to me, to be honest. There are some exceptions. For the most part, I was surprised with the representation of female characters on screen in these films, she said and added, I do hope that when we include more female storytellers, we will have more women that I recognize in my day-to-day life. Ones who are pro-active, have their own agencies, just dont react to the men around them. They have their own point-of-view. Notably, the Best Director award went to Sofia Coppola for the film Beguiled, which has a string cast of women. Agencies

Citibank, CCC begin second phase of rural economic programme
The Rural Economic Empowerment Programme initiated by Citibank in collaboration with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) and Hatton National Bank in June 2015 assisted over 400 rural entrepreneurs in four rural villages
These villages are Beralapanathara in Matara District, Dadayamkanda in Ratnapura District, Weheragala in Anuradhapura District and Udappuwa in Puttalam District.
The project provided business management training as well as technical training and facilitated financial assistance to the needy entrepreneurs through HNB.
The assistance provided helped rural entrepreneurs who had not had any formal training on business management before to plan and conduct their businesses in a more organised manner and expand their businesses using the financial assistance extended by HNB.
Satisfied with the success of the first phase of the project, Citibank decided to continue its partnership with the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce and Hatton National Bank to uplift the livelihoods of people in rural areas by implementing a second phase of the project targetting a few more remote villages of the country.
The second phase will focus on the same objectives as the first phase with a different geographical coverage.
As in the first phase, Citibank will provide overall direction and financial resources, guidance and professional expertise for training and capacity building of prospective entrepreneurs for successful implementation of the second phase.
Citibanks active support for this initiative epitomises its commitment towards promoting the livelihood development at grassroots level globally through sustainable financial inclusion. Citibank Sri Lanka together with Citibank Foundation has engaged in many CSR projects since its inception, demonstrating its dedication towards enhancing the economic opportunities for individuals and families of Sri Lanka and this project is a continuation of their CSR efforts to improve the businesses and living conditions of rural entrepreneurs.
Under the second phase, assistance is planned for entrepreneurs in a few remote villages in Galle and Anuradhapura Districts.
The Ceylon Chamber in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture of the Southern Provincial Council and the Galle District Chamber of Commerce has identified Maththaka, Niyagama, Poddiwela, Porowagama and Thalgaswala villages with a large number of rural entrepreneurs waiting for both management and financial assistance to improve and expand their businesses.
The second phase activities in Anuradhapura District began in collaboration with the North Central Provincial Council and the Anuradhapura District Chamber of Commerce. The project conducted the awareness session and baseline data collection of prospective rural entrepreneurs in Nochchiyagama and Nachchaduwa Divisional Secretariat areas with the participation of 55 and 56 beneficiaries respectively.

Bring the miscreants to book
I thank the European Union and many other countries for their concern over the recent wave of mob attacks on mosques and Muslim business establishments in the country. It is appreciable the foreign envoys of the European Union, the Netherlands, Australia, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa and Canada have urged the Government to take swift action to halt these incidents and arrest the miscreants who are plunged to disturb the peace and sabotage the reconciliation process the Sirisena Wickremesinghe government has set in motion.
Despite several mob attacks on Muslim mosques and business establishments by the BBS, it is astonishing the Government is still on the slumbering state without taking any action on the perpetrators. It is absurd and lamentable the Government waited until the foreign countries have taken their task to urge it to take action for the chaotic rabble rousers in the country.
The good governance government is committed to protecting the fundamental and human rights of every citizen of this country. It may be a Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu or Christian. Everybody should have his freedom of living, following a religion and worshipping ones own god. Disgracing and belittling a God or place of worship is unethical and illegal of creating hatred and tension among people of different faiths. We condemn such despicable and heinous acts whoever is responsible for them.
In addition, we are committed to thanking the Bar Association of Sri Lanka for calling upon the IGP, Attorney General and the Government to take immediate action to arrest the increasing trend of attacks against the Muslim community.
However, we never forget to thank Anura Kumara Dissanayaka for his recent speech in parliament raising the issue of the racial hatred against the Muslims unleashed by the BBS.

ComBank marks World Environment Day supporting reforestation project
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon is to partner with the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) to support the latters Reforestation of a Rainforest (ROAR) project under a milestone agreement signed by the two parties on June 5, World Environment Day.
The Bank has pledged funds over a three-year period, to reforest half a hectare of land designated as Zone D on Diyakotha Kanda in the village of Dikhena on the boundary of the Sinharaja rainforest, a biosphere reserve and World Heritage Site.
The project will involve the planting and nurturing of a minimum of 3,500 trees of pioneer plant species native to Sri Lanka or naturalised, the Bank said.
Zone D which has been allocated to Commercial Bank as a model site consists of rocky terrain with poor top soil. The objective of the ROAR project, on a block of land entrusted to the WNPS by the Forest Department of Sri Lanka, is to create a sustainable model for reforestation using a mixture of early and late successional species with a strong representation of native and naturalised species with optimal rates of growth and lowest cost.
A memorandum of understanding between the Commercial Bank and the WNPS governing the Banks support to the project was formally ratified by the Banks Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam and the Vice President of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society Rahula Dassenaieke.
Durairatnam said: Our country has been blessed with an abundance of natures bounty, but sadly, our flora and fauna are being depleted at an alarming rate. Deforestation has resulted in aggravating natural disasters.As an organisation that considers social responsibility one of its principal pillars, Commercial Bank is committed to support projects of this type that help redress some of the damage.
The Sinharaja forest and its environs are especially important, and it must be borne in mind that rainforests, while easy to destroy, are very difficult to regrow.
Established a game protection society in 1894, the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka has a membership of 3,000 and has as its patron the President of the country.
Commercial Banks engagement with the Societys ROAR project will be managed and monitored by the Commercial Bank Corporate Social Responsibility Trust, which is responsible for a multifaceted portfolio of community projects.
Among the projects supported by the Bank in the environment sphere is a ground-breaking initiative by the Department of Wildlife Conservation to replant coral in the Hikkaduwa Marine National Park.
It involved replanting an extent of 1,000 sq ft in the Walduwa area of the marine park, using techniques perfected in the Philippines. The original coral in this protected area was damaged in 1998 due to the warming of the ocean due to the El Nio southern oscillation and the tsunami of 2004.

Faiths aflame
For most people, following a religion means belonging to a religious denomination and following a system of beliefs, expressing it in certain practices of worship in private and / or in public devotion, celebrating holy days and adopting certain attitudes of life and striving to relate to oneself and others in ways consistent with ones beliefs. Although we are supposed to be living in a Dharmadveepa an island of righteousness, we are not a sufficiently spiritual people as a whole.
There is so much of crime and corruption, vice, cruelty and wickedness, dishonesty, deception and thieving, bullying and ragging, unkindness, rampant harassment and unlawfulness, indifference and unconcern for the helplessness and the sufferings of the poor. Professing to be religiously devoted men and women, some have unjustly used their office to do manifest wrong while others have swindled the Country and exploited her for self-gain.
There are many who frequent temples and participate in religious observances and yet engage in superstitious practices, usurp and abuse their official positions, careless of the duty of doing an honest job and are indifferent to social obligations, evading even the payment of taxes.
Yet other people who do not regularly participate in worshipful rites and celebrations in temples nevertheless live righteously and act according to their honest convictions.
Karl Marx, looking at all reality from the tinted glass of economics and class struggle, thought of religion, of his time naturally as observed by him, as an opium that drugged especially the poor people of an unjust, wicked and merciless commercialized capitalist world order that led them into an unreal and imaginary world of hope in a heaven beyond, that may never exist.
Even though a free, fraternal, just an honest society has not come about even in the socialist world, following Marx  in fact, atrocious crimes against humanity have been perpetrated in communist countries  many have dismissed religion as of no benefit to mankind; thought of God has been interpreted as a creation of the human mind, even though some would defend the rights of man to adopt and follow a religion of ones choice. People could have various attitudes to religion.
FROM HUMAN EXPERIENCE
Religions arose among human beings. There is a constituent element in all human beings that searches and yearns to find, embrace, acquire and possess spiritual values. Some values seem beyond man yet not beyond his reach. This search is not a search for physical goods and possessions of material value that could be measured in terms of silver and gold. It is a spiritual pursuit towards possessing a value, a basic and fundamental truth about life attained and found through spiritual search, human effort and insight and living ones life according to what one has found. Of course, selfishness and love of pleasure and indifference to principles and values of life do make a human being a hard-core prodigal.
Religions originated through the experiences of human beings. Some remarkable individuals experienced an enlightenment, a revelation hidden from the ordinary mass of human beings. And devoting themselves to that quest and imparting that learning of theirs to others they brought fellow human beings to a deeper, more abundant and meaningful level of human living. They who devoted themselves to the search for deep human and spiritual values of life shared their experiences with those who were closest to them who also likewise experienced and embraced the truth of the one who experienced it first.
It is necessary for all followers of a religion to examine the veracity and the substance of that original experience. If the experience of the original encounters is valid and authentic, then the followers too could have a similar experience because it is a human experience and a human understanding of it. They could then further test the truth of that unique primordial experience and come to a similar spiritual experience themselves.
Of course before basing oneself on such a truth also means investigating the validity, the authenticity and the reliability of the unique spiritual experience of the Teacher whose life does not show evident contradictions, evils or sin. An all-embracing and life-transforming experience of deep spiritual richness is experienced by those whose spirits could comprehend and absorb it and perceive its consistency to the truths of life as they know it. Reason leads one to distinguish between deluding imagination, misjudgement, misunderstanding, and credulous devotion leading to the misinterpretation of experiences, ambiguity in the communication of experiences and a perception of the clarity of truth from falsehood evidenced in the life. Also, the authenticity of the experiences of the first followers of such a leader and the truth, the validity and faithfulness of the communications transmitted by the followers of such a leader needs to be investigated.
RELIGIOUS TRADITION RELIABLE
A problem may arise because the religious leaders themselves did not leave a testament of theirs in a script of their own. What we have are testimonies of their closest followers, put down in writing. The written scriptures came as a result of an oral tradition. The oral tradition that developed with understanding and interpretation and preaching of the message was documented after a period of time.
The investigation should focus on How close was the relationship of the followers to the author of the proclamation. How faithfully has the oral proclamation been recorded without distorting it and how capable, competent and authoritative were they to do it. How realistically have the messages been transcribed needs to be judged by objectively and critically investigating the documentation and the manner and style of the documentation by the followers who recorded them and by establishing the authenticity of what has been documented and later copied innumerable times. And how reliable are the copies that record the religious tradition that has come down to us Once this has been established, one begins to have faith in what has been recorded and handed down.
EVALUATE THE SCRIPTURES
All religious scriptures should undergo this critical examination and evaluation just as archaeological artefacts, historical documents and religious relics should undergo verification and establishment of authenticity.
What should we expect to find in the testimony of the closest followers of the Teachers We should find an authentic record of what they experienced, knew, taught and shared. We should find the Teachers life to be a living epitome, a personification of his message.
There is something that transcends our individual selves that pervade humanity. This is evident when we go beyond ourselves to gratuitously serve others, especially when they need our help. It is up to each one of us to decipher whether it is a spiritual thirst that seeks satisfaction or whether there is a religious spirit pervading humanity. Even a person without a religion could have a spirituality, an acceptable attitude to life and its challenges; there cannot exist a religious person without a spirituality.
RELIGIONS SPIRITUALLY ENRICHING
Therefore the question can be asked whether our people understand well the religions they follow and whether they live according to what they understand and believe What is the spirituality in the religions they follow Is it a spirituality that is self-centred or a spirituality that is self-donating in service to others that spiritually enriches all
Human beings are influenced for the better or worse by other human beings. Some leading persons among religious leaders and politicians depending on the quality of their lives exercise a certain influence over others. When leading persons themselves are spiritually flawed and act in contravention of religious principles, they cause great harm to society.
Politicians in power though they like to show themselves as devoted to religion and benevolent to the followers of all religions, do not, in fact, act truthfully, honestly, justly, fairly and impartially in the crucial instances where truth, justice and good social order are at stake. They show themselves spineless and practically untrue to their own religion.
While even people of no religion urge the authorities to act determinedly to uphold law and order extending equality and justice towards all, the supposed to be followers of religious teachings show themselves to be weak and vacillating, not at all strengthened and emboldened by their religious principles. They do not show themselves to be deeply convinced or rooted on their religious principles.
Among the politicians following various religions are skimmers of commissions, bribe takers, drug traffickers, dishonest men and women who abuse their offices and their positions, money launderers, manipulators of people and law breakers. This shows that religion does not touch the interior core of their person leading them to act justly, truthfully, honestly and religiously. The pretence of being religious is a convenient and conventional political cover. If religion is vibrant among the prominent people, there cannot be room for hatred for minorities and anarchism. It is necessary for all to be honest about their religious affiliation and live truthfully and honestly according to the norms of their religion.

Gender quotas and equal opportunities
Increasing female representation in the political arena whilst ensuring gender equality in elections are issues that needs to be addressed with all possible haste in Sri Lanka. While the majority would state that over the past couple of years female participation in politics has gradually increased, in reality it has hardly made a dent on actual numbers.
It is in this backdrop that many countries decided to introduce a quota system to help women enter politics. According to the United Nations, quotas have exceptionally risen in the past decade around the world with about 40 countries implementing gender quotas in their Constitutions. Political parties in 50 other countries have also voluntarily implemented quotas in their voting lists. This means that around half of the worlds countries today use one or another form of quotas in politics.
Does quota system work for gender equality in politics
Despite the wide adoption of quotas, the quota system itself has been subjected to many an interesting debate on how effective it really is. The political world also argues that gender quotas will not help women and those quotas only make women appear weak in the world of politics.
Gender equality does not mean that women and men are the same in biological terms, according to United Nations Women (UN Women -2011). Instead, it is that women and men should be treated the same regarding their rights, responsibilities and opportunities.
Womens participation in the workforce has increased from 35 percent in 1990 to 40 percent in 2015 and the seats held by women in National Parliament have increased steadily between the year 2000 and 2015, but women are still under-represented in the world Parliaments with an average of one female out of five members, state the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP, 2015).
Given these dismal figures, the issue of gender equality in elections became a central point of focus at the recently held 14th International Electoral Affairs Symposium, organised by the International Centre for Parliamentary studies in association with the Election Commission of Sri Lanka.
The current challenges and opportunities on how to ensure accessibility, proportionally and representatives in elections whilst ensuring gender equality, were widely discussed among the representatives from different countries.
Experiences abroad
CEO, Central Election Commission of Palestine Hisham Kuhail was of the opinion that there was no need to rely on government rules and regulations to ensure gender equality.
He said an electoral body can contribute in many ways towards gender equality and the quota system was just one such tool. Public awareness needs to be promoted by bringing the stake holders on board to engage with the public and empower women to engage in the political process, said Kuhail.
Recently, we concluded a project funded by Norway, in which we had to bring the relevant stakeholders, civil society organisations and women organisations to address the needs highlighted by the Palestinian community. It was pointed out that women have less self- esteem to engage in political life. Therefore, we formulated strategies for women empowerment. We have also trained 500 people on advocacy using all the stakeholders and media. That was about empowering or enabling females in the local councils to come up with their ideas and guide them in implementing their ideas. An electoral body can embark on a pro-active approach to reach a specific goal, he said.
Moderator of the panel, Naushalya Rajapaksa, Attorney at law, Official Youth Delegate of Sri Lanka to the 70th United Nations General Assembly, pointed out that Bangladesh has top-ranked in gender equity in South Asia for the second consecutive year having closed its overall gender gap, according to the Global Gender Gap Index 2016 prepared by World Economic Forum.
She said Bangladesh has become the regions top performer, recording progress on the political empowerment gender gap.
Chief Election Commissioner, Bangladesh Election Commission, K.M Nurul Huda pointed out that this was due to the fact that the Constitution of Bangladesh had clearly stated the obligations of the people, politicians and the social responsibility towards engaging more women on the political empowerment process.
He referred to two great women in Bangladeshs political history, former Prime Minister Khaledha Zia and incumbent Prime Minister Sheik Hasina, as examples of such positive reinforcement.
If you take our history since 1996, women have represented key positions in Parliament such as the Prime Minister or Leader of the Opposition, he said.
Huda further explained that in local government elections, it was compulsory by law that one part of the permanent members, directly appointed by the area should be women. This contributed immensely in the decision making process of the local government bodies. It was also mandatory for a political party to have 30 percent of women representation.
The percentage of women engaging in different fields has increased and they equally represent men in all positions. I think we are going ahead in the right direction, he added.
Responding to a question raised by an audience about women leaders in the political field not hailing from political families, Huda said in South Asia, the majority of women engaged in politics come from a political background.
But there are also women who come into politics without a political background. The system that has been developed so far in Bangladesh encourages women without a family background also to engage in the political process. People also sometimes choose their leaders considering their family background, he said.
Rajapaksa in the meantime, questioned Kuhail on Article (17) of the Palestinian law on Local Council elections which guaranteed that women hold 20 percent of seats. She asked who decided whether women should hold 10 or 20 seats in the local bodies and asserted that once again, it was the men who made such decisions.
Kuhail responded that it differed from each country and in Palestine it was 20 percent. He stressed not to rely on the implementation of law and to be proactive.
Dont always wait for the government to change to bring about a change within the community. Start nagging the political parties. It is also the commitment of the political parties to advance women in the political process. Sometimes women are used to complete a quota. When there is a precise quota, the parties always try to stick to the quota and do not go above that. That needs to be changed, he said.
Electoral Commissioner, Electoral Commissioners office Mauritius, Irfan Abdool Rahman added that the year 2012 was an important year for women in Mauritius.
It was the year when the local government implemented a law which stated that at least one third of the candidates that run for local elections need to be of a different gender. This contributed to a notable increase in the number of women nominated and elected in Local Government and thus contested the notion that politics only belonged to men, he said.
Rahman further said one step towards gender equality in politics was to modernise the electoral system to create conditions to help more women participate actively in public life and reinforce the existing tendency to produce diverse and broad representation of all.
The quota system is the first step to ensure womens active political involvement.
However, as is seen from the results of the elections, the direct effect from the legislation has increased womens representation in the Local Government from 5 percent to 25 percent in Village Councils and from 12 percent to 35 percent in Municipal Councils, he said.
Challenges for women in politics
Female participation in politics is considered an issue wrought with personal, social and economic concerns. It is a huge challenge, for men and women without a political background to enter politics and women have other obstacles added to their path to make it even more arduous.
If this problem is to be addressed in an efficient and sustainable manner, Chief of Party, International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) Sri Lanka, Beverley Hagerdon explained that not one organization can be expected to solve all the prevailing issues relevant to women and politics.
It is considered a challenge for women to engage in the political process as there is a wrong public perception about women leaders. They are perceived to be weak, not having enough financial stability, having child care responsibilities, there is wide spread character assassination against women candidates in media as well as social media and violence against women who want to enter politics, she said.
She explained that it was more effective to use targeted and evidence based approaches to integrate men and women in the process and to promote diverse and inclusive representation to make desirable progress in the field.
In Sri Lanka, there were 6,000 positions in the Local Government level. Women were allocated 2,000 seats which is a 25 percent quota. The space wasnt created for women within that 6,000 positions, rather an extra 2,000 seats were added. Now there is going to be 8,000 seats for the Local Government level, she said.
Hagerdon noted that the socio cultural issues that women have to deal are also a barrier and added that electoral leadership and finding ways to get into politics was still a great challenge for women.
It is very evident in Sri Lanka that the lack of political awareness and empowerment among women is a prominent factor behind such low representation. Creating an environment for these women to succeed will result in the society being more receptive towards female leadership, she said.

La Forteresse (Private) Limited, a fully-owned subsidiary of Dhammika Perera-controlled Fortress Resorts PLC, will go ahead with its planned five-star property in Mirissa.
An application for the necessary approvals has been filed with Sri Lanka Tourism Development Bureau and the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI) and the company has already invested Rs. 364 million during FY16/17 towards the acquisition of land for the new hotel project.
The planning work on the property has already been completed in addition to land clearing and geographic investigations, according the Fortress Resorts latest annual report.
Additionally, architectural and structural engineering plans have also been completed and necessary applications have also been filed for water and electricity facilities.
Meanwhile approvals from the BOI have already been completed while Tourist Board officials have completed their initial reviews of the proposal as well as on-site reviews. Hence an official expressed confidence that the next phase of development will commence on schedule during the coming financial year.
The new venture will comprise a 66-room luxury resort featuring five-star class facilities and amenities set on a stunning piece of land on the popular Mirissa coastal region.
In recent years in particular, Mirissa has witnessed a remarkable transformation into a bustling new tourist hot-spot and we are extremely confident of the potential that this location will have to create another unique resort featuring the same seamless brand of tropical elegance for which the Fortress Resorts and Spas have become internationally renowned, the report said.
The Fortress Resort will also be closing operations from June 12 to July 25, 2017, as part of its ongoing renovation programme, which will see the complete reconstruction of our existing lobby to feature a timber finish and we will also use this time to modify the interior to add a further 30 rooms.

Harmony knows no race
The recent incidents of violence, intimidation, hate speeches and threats by few small groups of extremists on the Muslim community and their business and worship places have caused serious concern among the peace-loving people. The Government moved swiftly to mitigate the situation and President Maithripala Sirisena ordered law enforcement agencies to take stern action against those responsible. The Government also decided to create a special unit with full powers to curb religious and racial violence.
These were unfortunate incidents that should not have occurred. It has once again proven how fragile our inter-racial and inter-religious relations can be if there is no mutual understanding and respect among people of diverse races and religions. It has also demonstrated that we must never take our inter-racial and inter-religious harmony for granted. These incidents should serve as a warning sign to all of us on the need to improve peaceful co-existence among all communities in our country.
Of course, first of all, we need to carefully study the causes that provoked the recent discord and resulting violence. It seems obvious that the Police and the local political leadership failed to tackle the issues, then and there, when it cropped up at ground level. The reasons for such a lapse also need to be investigated and corrective action taken.
What we are witnessing today is that the social fabric which keeps the nation together can be affected by occasional incidents that portray intolerance, lack of respect for one another and even acts of extremism beyond acceptable norms.
Community leaders
Patriotic Sri Lankans, regardless of race, religion or political affiliation, must build bridges and not walls which will only divide us. We need more bridge builders to connect each other, not racial and religious bigots. As a nation, we cannot have any racial or religious tension, and attempts by certain quarters to instigate such strife will only further polarise our nation.
Racial and religious issues are the biggest obstacles to social cohesion and national unity and it should be the responsibility of all Sri Lankans to continue promoting harmony among different ethnicities despite the multifaceted challenges.
Perhaps Sri Lanka would be better served if the community leaders find space to engage in their communities in a constructive discussion so as to alter the sensitive climate that surrounds the topics of race and religion.
Role of school
It is in this aspect, that the school plays a very crucial role in maintaining religious and racial harmony. Take, for example, Singapore. They have a Racial Harmony Day which is regarded as an important date in the school calendar. On this day each year, schools celebrate in a variety of ways. Students share dishes traditionally associated with their ethnic cultures, wear traditional costumes, and organise small-scale exhibitions that showcase customs and festivals of different ethnic groups.
Such activities provide the opportunity for cultural interactions and the space for building inter-religious and inter-racial friendships. Additionally, schools also systematically foster better understanding through the curriculum of subjects like Social Studies, and Civics and Moral Education, where they develop students awareness on multiculturalism and teach them how to negotiate differences.
Unfortunately, Sri Lankan schools seldom discuss race and religious issues, because they are widely regarded as sensitive topics. Although most of the teachers know discussing such issues that emerge in daily life could potentially improve social cohesion, they would, however, avoid in-depth discussions in the class. They fear that they are ill-equipped to handle difficult situations, and some are even afraid that they would get into trouble with the law.
Guiding students
It is same with the general society also. We hesitate to upset the status quo and as a result, we fail to question, converse and understand others. Should this be the ideal cohesion that we should strive for Wouldnt this complacency potentially lead to an eruption of submerged animosity should something unfortunate happen in Sri Lanka
We need to seek answers to these questions.
This writer believes that the real question at hand is not a matter of whether we should talk about race and religion. Rather, we should ponder about how we can engage in constructive discussion in a respectful and enlightened manner. After 69 years of Independence, it would perhaps serve Sri Lanka better if we are able to change the sensitive climate that surrounds race and religion to allow more space for educators and other professionals to broach related topics.
In guiding students to have deep and honest dialogues on racial and religious matters, educators can help students develop critical thinking as well as empathy and respect for others when handling related issues. With such training from schools, the young would be better equipped to exercise deep thought, responsibility and tact when expressing themselves. This would be better for racial and religious harmony in Sri Lanka in the long-term.
Platforms
The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) are another platform introduced by the Singapore Government for local-level inter-religious and inter-racial platforms in every constituency. The work of the IRCCs is instrumental in strengthening social cohesion.
The IRCCs serve as important bridges between religious, ethnic and community groups at the local level. Leaders from various religious, ethnic and other community organisations have come together to join the IRCC networks to build friendships and trust. The IRCCs also aim to deepen peoples understanding of the various faiths, beliefs and practices through interfaith and inter-ethnic themed activities such as inter-faith heritage trails, inter-faith talks and dialogues and various ethnic and religious celebrations. The IRCCs are also primed to respond quickly to incidents with racial and religious tensions and to project solidarity on the ground during crises.
Through the IRCC, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) encourages leaders and their followers from religious organisations to join in the efforts to build networks of trust during peace time. MCCY is also actively involving the other ethnic and community organisations to participate in the IRCCs. In the aftermath of a crisis, they will be the key links to disseminate information, soothe and minimise communal tension, and maintain confidence in the community.
IRCC members also keep track of grievances and complaints from the ground, thus giving them a unique understanding of local racial or religious sentiments. IRCCs also function as the main sources of information from the Government on the ground. In addition, the IRCCs also organise important sessions like Networking Sessions, Interfaith Dialogues, interfaith/interracial visits, etc.
National IRCC Workshop
At this annual strategic workshop for members, key stakeholders reflect and take stock take on the IRCC milestones and achievements. The National IRCC Workshop is a platform for members, religious and community leaders to share, discuss and feedback on inter-racial and inter-religious issues. The workshop offers excellent opportunities for the members to network and cement valuable friendship bonds. In addition, the participants are appreciated and lauded for their efforts in promoting racial and religious harmony.
In the subject of racial and religious harmony, Singapore is a success story. Three years ago, the Pew Research Center (nonpartisan American fact tank) produced estimates of the religious makeup of 232 countries and territories. Singapore has the highest score on the Religious Diversity Index.
Common points
Let us honestly realise that Sri Lanka is facing a serious challenge today. The current religious and racial landscape is not something that can continue automatically through cruise control. We must be prepared to carry the torch; we must be conscious of the fault lines in our society. We must be prepared to do our part of managing our divisions and strengthening the cohesion in our society. To do this, we can learn a great deal from the experiences of other countries.
It is important to look back our history and celebrate our achievements but we must also look forward to the future and make sure we can continue to sustain many more centuries of peace and harmony in Sri Lanka. We should focus on the things we share - common reference points and shared experiences that bring us together as a nation that will build into our heritage and identity as Sri Lankans.

Health Ministry on alert for plastic rice

Acting Director of Health Dr. J.M.W.Jayasundara Bandara said that Food and Drug Inspectors release rice from customs only after conducting three tests and issuing a certificate confirming the quality of rice.
Addressing a press conference held at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo today Director Bandara said that the three tests are soaking rice in water, crushing rice and heating rice. The samples of questionable rice are now with the Medical Research Institute.
The City Analyst R.M.G.B.Rajanayake stated that the public can test the rice at home by burning the rice. Natural rice smells like `Roti' when burnt and plastic rice smells like plastic. Natural rice turns blue when Iodine added to the crushed rice. Instead of Iodine, the medicine Betadine can be used.
Plastic rice dissolves in Thinner but natural rice does not dissolve, Rajanayake further stated.

Hilton to extend its footprint in Lanka
Hilton Hotels, one of the top four hotel chains in the world, extended its footprint further in Sri Lanka with DoubleTree by Hilton signing a management agreement with KDU Adventures (Pvt) Ltd, a subsidiary of KDU Group (Pvt) Ltd.
This is to manage the 140-room DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila. The property is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2018. KDU Adventures (Pvt) will invest US $ 18 million in the project. The latest signing brings the current Hilton pipeline hotels in Sri Lanka to seven properties. In addition Hilton also manages two hotels in Colombo. We are looking to manage more hotels in Sri Lanka as we see a bright future for tourism in Sri Lanka, said Vice President, Hilton South East Asia and India, William Costley.
With a fast-growing, global portfolio of more than 500 upscale properties, we are delighted that our award-winning DoubleTree by Hilton brand is gaining attraction in Sri Lanka. The DoubleTree by Hilton Weerawila will mark the fourth upcoming DoubleTree by Hilton property in this emerging market, he said.
As tourism in Sri Lanka continues to grow, expanding our footprint in developing towns, including Tissamaharama, supports our mission to be the worlds most hospitable company by being in destinations where our guests want to travel, Costley said. He also said that the government target of attracting 4 million arrivals by 2020 is a reality.
Costley said that the Hilton was in Sri Lanka not only in good times but during bad times (war) as well. He said that Sri Lanka was one of the few countries to have the highest density of 9 Hilton group hotels. If and when Mattala Airport is fully operational deep south tourism would really pick up.
Meanwhile Chairman, KDU Group, Saman Upasena said that they will further invest US$ 9 million to add 60 more rooms to the hotel. We also invested on luxury staff quarters including a swimming pools and large play ground area. He said that they will also invest on two other hotels in Dambulla and Colombo and would also tie up with Hilton to manage them.
The KDU Group originating from Sabaragamuwa is the worlds largest black orthodox tea manufacturing facility in the world. It owns eight factories in the Sabaragamuwa Province and produces 12 million kilograms of tea annually, contributing to four percent of Sri Lankas entire tea production.
KDU Group has also ventured into F&B, hydropower, and petroleum industries and this is their first diversification to the leisure sector. DoubleTree by Hilton is a fast-growing, global portfolio of more than 500 upscale hotels with more than 119,000 rooms in gateway cities, metropolitan areas and vacation destinations across six continents.

Many actresses all over the world are adopting children and rearing them without a father. But at some stage they realize the child needs a dad in their lives, and off they troop in search of a dad. Here I am going to place an imaginary scene where an actress goes over to the Institute of Daddys and says, Principal sir, I need a father, someone whos topped the college of fathers! Whos excelled in all the subjects fathers study and is ripe and ready for fatherhood!
The Principal looks at her, wishes he was younger and could fit the role, but hastily puts aside such unhealthy thoughts and says, You may choose! Heres the first one; a bit domineering though!
Domineering! says the actress, that means hell bring my kids up with authority! Also, says the Principal sadly, hell think hes always right! Your kids may feel crushed by his dominance, may lose interest, wait to be 18 to get away from the house! Ouch! shouts the actress and looks for the next man, Whos this He looks charming and determined!
Will make you rich quickly, says the Principal of the school of dads, will see your kids have enough and more, but is deceiving and dishonest!
And my little ones will become the same! murmurs the actress, then hears a noise in the next room where her children are, she walks over to see a man standing in front of the TV they are watching.
If you dont eat dinner you dont watch TV! shouts the tall fellow.
Whats he doing whispers the actress as she looks at her petrified children. Ah! Thats the threatening type, hes always threatening to lock them up, throw away their TV or ground them! It could be good discipline for them what
But with no communication whatsoever! says the Principal sadly, he wont explain his actions; its threats, threats and threats!
They go outside where shes in time to see a man leave, he is good looking, wishes the children goodbye and smiles at her as he hurries off, Wait! shouts the actress, You seem like a good father! The man smiles and rushes on. Too busy! says the Principal, hes a workaholic, a good man, with a good income, but who your children will never see! The actress looks at the principal and bursts into tears, Arent there men who make good fathers she cries.
Oh yes, there is! sighs the Principal, A wise father! A man who works hard, but has time for his kids, who is there to teach them to ride a bike, is there to lift them when they fall, and laughs with them when they get up on their own! And does this institute make such a man asks the actress smiling. No, smiles the Principal, a good wife moulds such a man just as a loving husband makes a good mother of his wife..! [emailprotected]

Speaking at a media briefing at the Disaster Management Ministry yesterday, he also said that a Japanese expert team including 10 members arrived in Sri Lanka to provide a report on the damages caused by the heavy rainfall.
Yapa said that river banks should be declared as buffer zones to take precautionary actions against potential disasters for the betterment of the country.

The Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday slammed the governments relief efforts in the disaster-hit areas noting that it lacked direction and transparency.
Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said the JO will launch a street campaign demanding the government to provide adequate relief to the affected without any discrimination.
Although the government promised a series of measures, including building the damaged houses at a cost of Rs.2.5 million, compensation for businesses and damaged goods, they have failed even to pay the Rs.10,000 monthly allowance promised to the victims, Nanayakkara said.
Meanwhile, Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunewardene said lack of preparations by the government to face natural disasters aggravated the suffering of the people.
He said if a mechanism had been in place in disaster preparedness, a large number of lives could have been saved.
Gunewardene said flood and landslide mitigation plans and a mechanism to face natural disasters will be implemented under a future JO government.

LankaCorps Fellows explore, experience and give back to SL
Each year, the Asia Foundation selects young leaders of Sri Lankan origin to experience, explore and enjoy the country of their heritage for a period of six months.
These millennials hailing from the USA, Canada, UK, South Africa and Australia are all high achievers, most with multiple masters and a complex plethora of extracurriculars which has heralded a deeper understanding of the opportunities as well as challenges facing this economically burgeoning nation.
The LankaCorps Fellowship has just completed its fifth cycle and in each cycle, the Fellows have either returned to their countries of residence with a renewed vigour and understanding about Sri Lanka vowing to cascade the message that Sri Lanka has moved beyond its war years to one of promoting peace, while others have opted to stay back and contribute their impressive pool of knowledge and skill to projects and programmes in the country.
As each of the Fellows have detailed at the various forums they have been speaking at, growing up in an expatriate community can be challenging. Country Representative of The Asia Foundation Dinesha de Silva says, Depending on the circumstances under which these young people or their parents left the country, ideas and views are frozen in time and memories are naturally coloured, by their own unique experiences.
We do feel that the Fellowship has piqued their curiosity, enabling them to explore their parents past and their heritage while not compromising their career aspirations and professional development. By living and working here, they are able to form their own perceptions and views about the country and have a direct connection.
Within the institutional framework of The Asia Foundation, Fellows have been placed in entities that would encourage them to contribute towards Sri Lankas development, while maximising on their education, background and skill sets.
From the Foundation of Goodness, to the Carbon Consulting Group, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, ICES, Center for Poverty Analysis, National Water Supply & Drainage Board, Emerge Lanka Foundation, Family Planning Association, Family Rehabilitation Center, the Chitrasena-Vajira Dance Foundation and some who have returned to launch their own organisations like Suneyra Lanka and Qualia Solutions, these Fellows are truly living and breathing the experience of the current day Sri Lanka.
Purely funded by the good offices of committed expatriate Sri Lankans including Los Angeles physician and ardent proponent and supporter of the LankaCorps Fellowship, Dr Naj Nagendran, De Silva urges the private sector to partner with the Asia Foundation as it is imperative that the nation as a whole takes ownership of the core vision of the programme.
While the country is looking at an aggressive development plan, the LankaCorps Fellowship allows the astute use of these millennials expertise and knowledge for the countrys advantage. Given the significant pool of talent and vast experiences collated within this cohort of young people, the country can not only maximise their resources for economic development, but also for social development in the context of post-conflict reconciliation and thereby nation building.

Measures in place for Poson festival in Anuradhapura
All infrastructural facilities such as drinking water, electricity, sanitation, transport and security have been arranged for devotees arriving in Anuradhapura during the national Poson religious festival season, said the head of the Poson celebrations Steering Committee and Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake.
He said although floods and drought was experienced in many parts in the country, around one million devotees are expected in Anuradhapura during the Poson festive season. Almost all small tanks in the Anuradhapura district have run dry. Even in the major tanks, the water levels are rapidly decreasing but we have made arrangements to provide sufficient drinking water to the devotees. The national Poson festival commenced yesterday and will culminate on June 11. During this period, all liquor shops and meat stalls will be closed. The police and Excise Department will implement a continuous raiding programme to detect liquor and narcotic dens in the sacred cities, Wanninayake said.
The traditional week long Poson Pirith chanting ceremony commenced at a special Pirith Mandapaya in Mahamewunawa yesterday after the water from Tisawewa was taken in procession from the Isurumuniya Raja MahaViharaya to the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya before commencing the traditional pirith chanting by the Maha Sangha headed by Atamasthanadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasanayaka Thera.
The Lake House Mihinthala Aloka Pooja will be held for the 55th consecutive time at Mihinthale for five days. The President and Prime Minister are expected to participate in the switching on of the illumination programme on June 8, Poson Full moon day. The Lakdanaw Institute will contribute towards the illumination of Ruwanweli Chaithya, Jethawanarama, Abayagiriya, Lankarama and Mirisawetiya Chaithyas. It is reported that additional transport services are being operated from other stations to Anuradhapura and Mihinthale by CGR, CTB and the private bus associations during the Poson week for the benefit of devotees travelling to Anuradhapura and Mihinthale from all parts of the island.
Although the water levels of the water sources in Anuradhapura and Mihinthale are low, steps have been taken to maintain lifesaving activities and disaster prevention service close to the reservoirs such as Mahakanadarawa, Nuwarawewa, Tisawewa, Basawakkulama etc, for the protection of devotees.
The theme of the 2017 national Poson festival is Lets protect the Mihindu Culture - lets line up to follow such policies. Accordingly, devotees who wish to come to Anuradhapura on Poson pilgrimages are requested to clad in white sans liquor, gambling etc,during their stay in Anuradhapura and Mihinthale sacred cities for worship.
I would like to request the government and private sector business enterprises to refrain from unwarranted advertising and launching dancing and musical items concerning and confined to business purposes during the Poson religious festive season in Anuradhapura, Mihintale and other sacred areas which would spoil the spiritual atmosphere that should prevail during Poson. Poson is a religious festival, commemorating the Mahindagamanaya and should not be a carnival session, emphasized Ruwanweli Chetiyaramadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera.

Nadal and Djokovic into quarters as champion Muguruza exits
Paris,Sunday: Nine-time champion Rafael Nadal and title-holder Novak Djokovic surged into the French Open quarter-finals for a record-equalling 11th time on Sunday, but reigning women's champion Garbine Muguruza crashed out in the last 16.
Nadal continued his ruthless form at Roland Garros by dispatching Spanish 17th seed Roberto Bautista Agut 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 to match Roger Federer's mark of last-eight appearances in Paris.
The 14-time major winner has dropped just 20 games in four matches as he strives to become the first man to win 10 titles at a single Grand Slam.

"I'm happy because Roberto is a very good player. It's very important for me to be in the quarter-finals one more time," said Nadal, who turned 31 on Saturday.
"Probably I didn't play as well as I did the other day, but I still played well."
The fourth seed will meet compatriot Pablo Carreno Busta, through to his first Slam quarter-final, for spot in the last four after the latter stunned Canada's Milos Raonic.
Carreno Busta, seeded 20th, needed seven match points to clinch a thrilling 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-7 (6/8), 6-4, 8-6 win over the fifth-seeded Raonic.
Djokovic also became an 11-time quarter-finalist as he sauntered past Spain's Albert Ramos-Vinolas 7-6 (7/5), 6-1, 6-3.
The Serb needed 75 minutes to clinch the opening set but then outclassed the 19th seed to set up a showdown with Dominic Thiem.
"There's no easy match in a Grand Slam quarter-final, it will be very difficult for both of us," said Djokovic of his upcoming challenge.
The Serb also confirmed that coach Andre Agassi had, as planned, already left Paris.
Austrian sixth seed Thiem thrashed Argentina's Horacio Zeballos 6-1, 6-3, 6-1 to reach the quarters for a second straight year.
Japan's Kei Nishikori fought off a fierce challenge from South Korea's Hyeon Chung in an all-Asian tussle held over from Saturday following rain to clinch a place in the last 16.
Chung quickly forced the contest into a fifth set as play resumed on Sunday, but the world number 67 double faulted on match point to gift Nishikori a 7-5, 6-4, 6-7 (4/7), 0-6, 6-4 victory.
"I think the rain helps me a lot, because I was really down in the fourth set and mentally I wasn't ready," admitted Nishikori, who faces Fernando Verdasco next.
Karen Khachanov will play Andy Murray in the fourth round after the giant Russian beat American 21st seed John Isner 7-6 (7/1), 6-3, 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/3). Kristina Mladenovic ensured the host nation will have two women in the quarter-finals for the first time since 1994 after dumping out fourth seed Muguruza 6-1, 3-6, 6-3.
"I'm sad. It's a very painful defeat here in the French Open," said Muguruza, who left Court Suzanne Lenglen angrily wagging her finger at the crowd. "I just think that they sometimes should be a little bit more respectful," she added, as Mladenovic thrived on the partisan support.
The French 13th seed is through to just her second Slam quarter-final -- after the 2015 US Open -- and will face Switzerland's Timea Bacsinszky for a spot in the last four. The Swiss 30th seed, a 2015 semi-finalist, defeated 2002 runner-up Venus Williams 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 to guarantee a first-time major champion will be crowned next Saturday. .AFP

No provisions in the law for by-elections: EC
Currently, there are no laws to hold by-elections when an incumbent politician dies, resigns or becomes ineligible to continue in office, Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya said.
He was addressing the National Voters Day 2017 event held at the Faculty of Law, University of Colombo yesterday. It was organized by the Election Commission in collaboration with the International Foundation for Electoral System (IFES) Sri Lanka.
There are several measures taken to strengthen the electoral system, but nowhere do I see initiatives to provide for by- elections. I have no idea whether there are any proposals to include this in the proposed new Constitution, he said.
Deshapriya further said the significance of celebrating National Voters day is to encourage more young voters to take part in the political process. He stressed the importance of youth participation in the electoral process.
Deshapriya said in India there was a request to include None Of The Above (NOTA) in the ballet papers to show their dislike for the candidates. The public didnt want to cancel their votes but to express their displeasure. The Indian supreme court agreed to include NOTA in the ballot papers.
He said the topic is being discussed and added that he neither encourages nor discourages it. One of the frequent questions from the youth is why we dont have it here in Sri Lanka. But it has to come through the public and parliament. It has to be legally accepted , he said.
He said that responsible voting should be encouraged among public especially the youth. He pointed out that there is less representation of youth in parliament and also added that youth are not much interested in getting involved in political activities.
Deshapriya pointed out that it is very important to elect the most suitable and talented candidates. IFES Chief of Party Beverly Hagerdon was also present.

NTB fosters research and education on biodiversity
Recognising the important role biodiversity and ecosystem services play towards quality of life and wellbeing of the economy, Nations Trust Bank strengthened its collaboration with Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) in fostering research and education on biodiversity, with its full sponsorship of the Loris and Warana/Waranam magazines.
The sponsorship spans a period of three years from 2017 to 2019 with the first magazine published under this agreement being the renewed Warana/Waranam magazine that has undergone a major format change to become the first bilingual magazine on nature to be published in Sri Lanka.
The e-version of Warana/Waranam magazine and the Loris magazine was to be made freely accessible on Wildlife and Nature Protection Societys webpage from June 5.
Warana magazine that is primarily enriched by the research findings of the local university undergraduates is being made available to the school library system, thereby fulfilling dual objectives of promoting research in tertiary education, whilst at the same time being a source of science based learning in secondary education.
Loris magazine that reaches wildlife enthusiasts and environmental advocates from civil society equips them with the latest research on the status of biodiversity in the country, sheds awareness on species at risk and conservation efforts underway.
Renuka Fernando, Chief Executive Officer, Nations Trust Bank said, Given the status of Sri Lanka as a biodiversity hotspot and the lack of due recognition about the value of biodiversity and ecosystem services, it is imperative that further research is undertaken and evidence-based knowledge becomes available to public at large, so we have a better understanding and appreciation of the kind of action that is required. That is why we are investing in promoting quality research and knowledge dissemination as we are doing with the Loris and Warana/Waranam magazines.
The sponsorship of the magazines is in addition to the Nations Trust Banks current endorsement of WNPSs annual ten-part lecture series, featuring leading biodiversity researchers.
Rukshan Jayewardene, President, Wildlife and Nature Protection Society, said, Within the confines of a 65,000 sq km island, Sri Lanka punches way above her weight in terms of both biodiversity (flora and fauna) as well as spectacular mega fauna. Apart from the little animals such as frogs, fresh water fish and crabs, skinks, lizards, ground snakes and insects to name a few, Sri Lanka is remarkable in that we are probably the best place in all the world to see leopard, sloth bear, Asian elephant, marsh crocodiles and blue and sperm whales.
He said the future of Sri Lanka's biodiversity rests with future leaders and decision makers of the island. In that respect, both the monthly lecture series and the two publications Loris and Warna/Waranam presented and published by WNPS and sponsored by Nations Trust Bank is of key importance to our conservation process.

Number of Arab countries sever diplomatic ties with Qatar
A number of Arab countries including Saudi Arabia and Egypt have cut diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing it of destabilising the region.
They say Qatar backs militant groups including so-called Islamic State (IS) and al-Qaeda, which Qatar denies.
The Saudi state news agency SPA said Riyadh had closed its borders, severing land, sea and air contact with the tiny peninsula of oil-rich Qatar.
Qatar called the decision unjustified and with no basis in fact.
The unprecedented move is seen as a major split between powerful Gulf countries, who are also close US allies. It comes amid heightened tensions between Gulf countries and their near-neighbour, Iran.
The Saudi statement accused Qatar of collaborating with Iranian-backed terrorist groups in its restive eastern region of Qatif and in Bahrain.
Meanwhile,an Iranian official says his country can export food to Qatar by sea, as Saudi Arabia and three other nations move to isolate the gas-rich nation after severing diplomatic ties and accusing it of supporting terrorism.
The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Reza Nourani, Chairman of the Union of Exporters of Agricultural Products, as saying Monday that food shipments sent from Iran can reach Qatar in 12 hours.

Original Amazing Grace reunion concert
In 1973, Augie Ranaweera, who was porbably the most respected Recording and PA engineers in the land, decided to put together a new band to enter the music scene in Sri Lanka. Little did he know at the time that this idea of his was going to result in the formation of one of Sri Lanka's most influential supergroups of it's time. This then brought back together three, near lifelong musician friends, who had worked together on and off over the years, Tony Silva, (Keyboards and Vocals), Benjamin Ranabahu (Bass) and Donald Pieris (Drums and vocals).
Tony at the time was the keyboard player and one of the singers with the popular Moonstones, Donald Pieries was the drummer with the Experiments and Benjy was with The Pioneers. Augie then invited Joey Lewis, who himself was also well known in the music scene as a solo Singer and guitarist to come over and meet Tony, Benjy and Donald. ,
After hearing the guys play, Joey had asked if he could have a go with them. Joey with a borrowed guitar, plugged in, and from the very first song they played together, the birth of one of Sri Lanka's all time supergroups took place. The three voices of Tony, Donald and Joey blended so well, that there was no song they could not take on and make their own.
One of the biggest problems they were facing was to get a name that suited them. This is where Joey's mother Myfanwy came to the rescue, suggesting Amazing Grace. It was she who got them their first contract to perform at The Little Hut nightcub at the Mount Lavinia Hotel too.
Having songs from the Bee Gees, Grand Funk Railroad and Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young in their repertoire, performed so brilliantly, with their powerful vocal harmonies, took these four teenagers right to the top.
We were brothers in music, says Joey. We never had a cross word between us ever. Yes, we might have disagreed sometimes but our friendship and respect for each others talent, always won the day. We, each of us, had a roll to play, he says with a smile. Tony was the electronics genius and helped us to create the sound of the band, I was the frontman, Donald was the voice we all just wanted to hear, and Benjy got the girls. Amazing Grace, over the years went through many changes with Joey, Donald and Benjy venturing out and returning from time to time. Tony, together with gifted singer/guitarist Reza Deane, kept the band at the top of the music scene, with the help of other very talented local musicians who joined them at various times, until 1978 when the group broke up.
This led to Tony approaching Joey to reform the band with himself and Reza. The new phase, as it became, of Amazing Grace, then came alive with Joey Lewis going back to his roots and playing bass, Hassan Musaffer on drums and Nihal Chanderatne joining them for a whole new era of Amazing Grace. This new line up saw Amazing Grace take a completely new direction with their approach to their music, presentation and repertoire.
An Original Amazing Grace reunion show was never going to happen for many reasons, not least because of the personal commitments of the founder members, which made their trying to be available at the same time simply impossible but Damayantha Kuruppu has proved that all things are in fact possible.
DK Promotions is proud to announce that Tony, Donald, Benjy and Joey, the four guys who started the magic of Amazing Grace, will get together, after nearly 40 years, for one last time together, at the BMICH on June 11.

Peradeniya University report on Meethotamulla complete


An expert team from the University of Peradeniya handed over their 42-page report on the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump to the police today. This was in accordance to an order from the Hulftsdorp Magistrates Court asking the team to conduct an investigation into the matter.
Vice Chancellor, Upul Dissanayake handed over the report to the police who will then submit it to courts. The Police Environmental Protection Division is expected to submit the report to courts on 12 June.
The courts had directed Vice Chancellor Dissanayake to conduct the investigation and he in turn had appointed a committee of 14 researchers from the Engineering, Agriculture and Arts faculties to conduct the study over a period of two months.
Peradeniya University, Civil Engineering Department Head, Dr Jayalath Edirisinghe led the team and they conducted field visits, in addition to studying reports from the Meteorological Department and National Building Research Organization and other organizations for their report.

Police make more arrests over London terror attack
UK: Police carried out fresh raids and arrested a number of people on Monday after the Islamic State group claimed an attack by three men who mowed down and stabbed revellers in London, killing seven people before being shot dead by officers.
Saturday nights rampage at a popular nightlife hub around London Bridge by men wearing fake suicide vests was the third deadly terror attack in Britain in less than three months and came only days before a general election.
A number of people have been detained, police said in a statement after two early morning raids in east London, as commuters returned to the scene of the attacks after some security cordons were removed.
A very high priority for us is to try to understand whether they were working with anybody else, London police chief Cressida Dick told BBC television.
Dick said police had seized a huge amount of forensic material after going through the van used in the attack very very carefully.
We will change and adapt to what appears to be a new reality for us, she said.
British Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday blamed evil Islamist ideology and vowed to crackdown on extremist content online worldwide, warning that attackers were copying one another. National campaigning for Thursdays general election resumed on Monday after a one-day suspension out of respect for the victims, who included 48 people treated in hospital for injuries. Of those, 21 are still in a critical condition.
Police said on Sunday they were holding 11 people, all arrested in raids on two addresses in Barking in suburban east London. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility.
A detachment of fighters from Islamic State carried out London attacks, said the Amaq news agency, which is affiliated with the jihadists. One Canadian national and one Frenchman were among the fatalities and seven French citizens were among the injured. No details have been released about the perpetrators, who were shot dead within eight minutes of the first call to the police.
Eight officers fired an unprecedented 50 rounds at the three attackers, according to Mark Rowley, head of national counter-terrorism policing, who said that a bystander had also suffered a gunshot wound.
The Prime Minister said the attack was driven by the same evil ideology of Islamist extremism behind the May 22 Manchester suicide bombing that left 22 people dead, and the Westminster attack in March, which killed five.
The assailants ran people over on London Bridge before lunging seemingly at random at the crowds gathered around Borough Market, which is full of restaurants and bars.
Gerard Vowls, 47, said he saw a woman repeatedly stabbed, and threw chairs, glasses and bottles at the attackers in a bid to stop them.
They kept coming to try to stab me... they were stabbing everyone. Evil, evil people, he told The Guardian newspaper.
Another witness called Eric told the BBC he had seen three men get out of the van who took out knives.
It was a rampage, he said, adding that he heard a shout of: This is for Allah. - AFP

Raabta is an original film
The makers of Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon starrer-Raabta are in trouble as the filmmakers of the 2009 SS Rajamouli's Magadheera claim there are lot of similarities between the two films.
They have reportedly sought an injunction against Raabta's release.
To this development, Dinesh Vijan and Bhushan Kumar  the producers of Raabta  have replied in an official statement.
India Today reports: "We would like to categorically reject even the remotest of suggestions that our film is a copy of Magadheera. We find it extremely unsavoury and disrespectful when people from the industry belittle someone's hard work by using words like 'copied', 'plagiarised' nonchalantly and jump to conclusions merely on the basis of a 2 minute and 14 second trailer, without verifying the facts or waiting for the film to release for the public to give its verdict."
Taran Adarsh took to Twitter on 25 May and posted the official public announcement from Raabta's producers.
A Hyderabad court will hear the case on 1 June and will decide whether Raabta should be released on its stipulated date of release 9 June.
Raabta also stars Jim Sarbh and Varun Sharma in pivotal roles.
Rajkummar Rao, who has a guest appearance in the film, is almost unrecognisable in his look.
First Post
The Hindi film Raabta will begin screening from June 9 in CEL theaters islandwide. It is subtitled in English
