Crop Circle forest
A forest in Japan is creating quite a stir with its unique shape. In the Miyazaki Prefecture of southern Japan, groups of Japanese cedar trees swell toward the sky, creating mysterious concentric circles. After a recent aerial photo spotted these crop circles, it left people wondering just how they were formed.
The picturesque natural formations arent the results of an alien invasion, but rather a well thought out plan that took place nearly 50 years ago. A document by the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries explains that whats now visible is due to a 1973 project regarding growth and tree spacing. At the time, the area was designated as experimental forestry and one experiment saw researchers planting trees in 10 degree radial increments to form 10 concentric circles.
Whats now visible - even on Google Earth - are the results after 45 years. Whats quite interesting is that the trees also grew in a convex shape, fanning out into the forest and showing that spacing does have unexpected results on growth. The original plan called for the trees to be harvested in 5 years, but given the new interest, officials are considering saving the circular forest. My Modern Met

2018: Events that shaped the world
As the year draws to a close, we take a look at some of the key events that shaped our world in 2018.
South Korea-North Korea friendship soars
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached out to South Korean President Moon-Jae to meet for talks in Pyongyang. This eventually led to talks between Un and US President Donald Trump in Singapore in June. The two Korean leaders have since met several times and just this week, work was started on physically linking the railway systems of the two countries. However, sanctions imposed on North Korea are still effective, but one cannot rule out eventual reunification in the decades to come.
New direction in China
Chinese President Xi Jinping
In March, China's Parliament decided to make certain changes that would allow President Xi Jinping to virtually rule for life. This has strengthened the hands of Xi, already one of the most powerful men in the world. This year, China also figured in a trade war with the United States, where President Trump charged that China was taking unfair advantage lax tariffs on the US side. However, the two sides have since reached a truce and compromise on many contentious trade issues.
President Putin gets stronger
US President Donald Trump greeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at Helsinki summit.
Also in March, Russian President Vladimir Putin was reelected, with the potential to rule at least until 2024. This was a mixed year for Russia, with the West implicating the country in the Salisbury nerve agent attack and various cyber attacks. Resident Putin also held a landmark summit with President Trump in Helsinki, where the latter was accused by the Western media of siding more or less with President Putin on the issue of cyber attacks despite assessments to the contrary by Western intelligence agencies. As the year draws to a close, we take a look at some of the key events that shaped our world in 2018.
Cuba  life without the Castros
Miguel Diaz-Canel became the Cuban President, after Raul Castro stepped aside. This marked the end of the Castro rule in Cuba after nearly six decades. While still firmly committed to the ideals of Fidel and Raul Castro, he has since opened up Cuba in many ways. It was only a few weeks ago that Cuba finally allowed its citizens to browse the Internet on smartphones. With direct flights from the US in full swing, tourism dollars are starting to make a difference in this island nation. A plane crash that killed over 100 people drove Cuba into mourning in May.
Royal Wedding
Royal wedding: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle
In a world mired in conflict, a Royal Wedding is always a welcome respite. On May 18, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle officially tied the knot. Markle was already a household name in the US and UK as a well-known television actress and the wedding was a fairytale set in the real world. They even drove away in a retro electric Jaguar. Worldwide, billions of people were glued to their TV sets.
A stunning comeback for Mahathir
Malaysias Grand Old Man of politics, Dr. Mahathir Mohamad made a stunning comeback at the elections held in May. At 93, he is the oldest serving prime minister or president anywhere in the world, Robert Mugabe having retired in 2017. Mahathir has promised to crack down on corruption and authorities have already charged former PM Najib Razak with over 25 accounts of corruption.
A new innings for Imran Khan
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan
Closer home, legendary cricketer Imran Khan won the elections held on July 25 in Pakistan, becoming Prime Minister. Khan, who led Pakistan to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia, faces great challenges ahead as he guides a nation driven apart by conflict, corruption and terrorism. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is facing jail time on corruption charges. Imran Khan has promised to get rid of corruption in Pakistani politics.
Better times ahead for Maldives
Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih
In November, new Maldivian President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih took the oath of office after defeating strongman Abdulla Yameen in September 23 election. Maldives has been drifting on and off democracy, but this time there is hope for more stability and prosperity. It already has the highest Per Capita Income among the SAARC nations at over US$ 10,500 and consequently, it is the only developing country in South Asia to enjoy visa-free access for its citizens to many Western nations including the UK.
Jamal Khashoggi
Slain Washington Post journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.
Washington Post journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on October 2 and was never seen alive again. Alerted by his fiance who was waiting outside for him to emerge, Turkish officials concluded that he could have been slain inside the consulate. Saudi Arabia later admitted that he had indeed been killed and arrested 15 men allegedly responsible for the murder. It was later revealed that Turkish intelligence services had a recording of Jamals last moments as he was killed. This was one of the biggest news stories of the year. The incident has also brought into focus Saudi Arabias role in the war in Yemen which has already killed about 10,000 people with 20 million at risk of starvation.
New leaders, some on way out
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May.
With nationalism and isolationism on the rise around the world, both Hungary and Italy saw such leaders emerge onto the political limelight. In Hungary, the far-right Viktor Orban has taken a strictly anti-immigrant stance. The same story holds true in Italy where New Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has expressed similar views. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel holds diametrically opposite views, her party has already chosen her successor - Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer or AKK as she is often called (mainly to get around the difficult pronunciation). In the UK, Prime Minister Theresa May barely survived a confidence vote, but her Brexit plans have been widely criticized. There is every chance that Brexit might not even happen, as people have now realized that Vote Leave was apparently based on a heap of lies. In Brazil former Army captain Jair Bolsonaro was elected as Brazils new president while in Mexico, Andrs Manuel Lus Obrador (AMLO) was elected President.
Climate Change and Natural Disasters
In a recently released report, the UN warned that the world has only 12 more years (until 2030) to mitigate the effects of climate change or face the point of no return. The US Government too released a similar report but the US itself has pulled out of the Paris Climate Accord. However, world leaders who gathered last month in Poland reiterated their commitment to the goals of the Paris Climate Pact. Freak weather events caused by climate change occurred throughout the world. Although not related to climate change per se, Indonesia was hit by two devastating tsunamis in the space of six months.
Government shutdown in US
One of President Trumps main campaign planks was a border wall to keep Mexican and Latin American migrants away from the US. This issue has led to a partial government shutdown in the US, where President Trump is seeking at least US$ 5 billion for building the wall. His Defence Secretary James Mattis resigned over plans to pull US troops out of Syria. However, all of Washington came together to mourn the passing away of the Grand Old Man of US Politics, President George H.W. Bush. In other US news, On May 8, President Trump pulled the United States out of the 2015 accord that limits Irans nuclear weapons programme in exchange for an easing of sanctions against the Islamic republic. On May 14, the United States opened its new Embassy in Jerusalem.
Good things happened too
We often hear of conflicts, but peace deals were also made. Ethiopia and Eritrea ended hostilities and established diplomatic relations.
The rescue of a 12 members of a boys football team trapped in a flooded Thai cave in July became a worldwide sensation. The #MeToo Movement against sexual harassment recorded many victories.
A worldwide campaign has begun against the use of single-use plastics including straws. It was reported that dog meat was on the way out in many countries including South Korea. And in what surely is the most inspiring story of the year, seven year old Archie Schiller, who suffers from congenital heart disease, was made honourary captain of the Australian cricket team for the Boxing Day Test against India.
Thousands of spectators watched as the little boy shook hands with the Indian captain at the coin toss, signalling the start of the match.
He was just on top of the world to be out there with the team, I've never seen him smile so much, his mother Sarah Schiller told the BBC. For the young cricket fan, he was granted his dream to captain Australia by Cricket Australia and the Make-A-Wish Foundation charity.
Archie was diagnosed with a heart condition at birth, and underwent open-heart surgery at three months and he has undergone 13 surgeries in total. If this story does not move you to tears, you are not human. Lets hope that 2019 will be a year of more good news for all the people of the world, that is facing many challenges.

Angelo Mathews ruled out of Brisbane Test
Sri Lanka batsman Angelo Matthews, who was forced to retire hurt on the fourth day of the second Test against New Zealand at Christchurch due to hamstring discomfort, has been ruled out of the limited-overs leg of the New Zealand tour.The right-hander scored 22 runs off 54 deliveries before his left hamstring troubled him in the afternoon session on Saturday, 29 December. He batted through the session after being attended to by the medical team, but did not return to the crease after tea.Later, scans revealed a grade two strain in his left hamstring and the injury ruled him out of the three one-day internationals and one-off Twenty20 International against New Zealand starting 3 January that follow the Test series, which Sri Lanka lost 1-0 after losing the Chirstchurch Test by 423 runs."Angelo had a scan last night, and it's a grade two hamstring strain," said captain Dinesh Chandimal after the Test. "The physio said he's out for four weeks."Mathews emerged as one of Sri Lanka's best batsmen in the series, scoring 258 runs across the two games including an unbeaten 120 in the first Test in Wellington that helped Sri Lanka draw the Test as he and Kusal Mendis batted out the entire fourth day.His injury has also put him in doubt for the Australia Tests that follow the New Zealand tour, starting 24 January 2019.

[APPRECIATIONS - (31-12-2018)]
Rev. Canon Gamini Seresinhe
He rejected sin, but accepted sinners
Who is wise and understanding among you Let him show it by his good life, by deeds done in humility that comes from wisdom. - James 3: 13.
I pen these words with gratitude, in memory of late Rev. Canon Gamini Seresinhe (our father who is in heaven) in order that his name be respected and his will be continued to be done on earth by all who loved and associated him. He was born on December 28, 1933, as the eldest son of Richard Wilson Seresinhe and Catherine Seresinhe.
He was nurtured by his two brothers, Nihal and Gladstone, in Baddegama, the cradle of indigenisation of the Church of Sri Lanka. His father was a landed proprietor and his mother was the Principal of Baddegama Christ Church Girls' School. She had penned more than 40 lyrics in the Christian Hymnal and was a violinist, too. Her elder brother was Chancellor Emeritus of Vidyodaya and Chief Sanga Nayaka of South Ceylon Ven. Baddegama Piyarathana Thera.
We are certain that Rev. Fr. Gamini was rooted in our culture and rich heritage, and was knowledgeable in all faiths in this country. He was never shy to say about his humble beginnings. Being a student of Christ Church Boys' School, Baddegama and Richmond College, Galle, he was well-versed with the English Language and the norms and etiquettes of the West.
He entered Theological College in 1956, completed his studies in 1961, and was ordained in 1963. During his student days at the seminary, he had loved Prison work and had visited Ven. Somarama Thera (assassin of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike) with Christine Hall. He had also visited the shanties near Golf Links and had bathed the poor. Ven. Narada Thera, who taught in the Divinity School, had been a very good friend of Rev. Fr. Gamini. Influenced by Bishop Lakdasa de Mel and loved by Bishop Harold de Soysa, he envisioned Church to be Sri Lankan in fibre and flavour.
He was an unpurchasable priest who hated sin but loved sinners. At a time when we have crooks in priests clothing, he always put his trust in the Saviour and not on silver; in God and not on gold. He served Mt. Lavinia, Egoda Uyana, Kandy, Ampara (the Bakkiella church was started by him) Bandarawela, Panadura, and the longest period, at Nugegoda.
As a person who had a wound in the heart, he knew what heartache was all about, as much as Jesus who had scars (and who knew what pain was) was the God of the stars. He reversed the churches that were class-filled and Christ-empty and wanted us also to feel the human pain, rather than the class pain.
Rev. Fr. Gamini always had the right attitudes, but his arteries gave trouble. Like Jonah, David, Elijah, Simeon Peter, John, and Mark, God gave him two chances. He was taken to England in 1968 for a bypass operation, and came back and inspired many lives, including mine, for another 31 years. He always went ahead with the task believing in the power behind. Among the retired clergyman, he had the best garden in the cathedral premises.
Rev. Fr. Seresinhe always wore the robe with sandals. He knew how to bring people to God, as well how to nurture them. He never allowed people to deceive him. His life spoke very clearly, but he never closed his lips for God. Things that were bitter, he made better. He made music out of misery, song out of sorrow, and success out of setbacks.
He never compromised on clear moral and spiritual issues, be it our liturgy, school syllabus or mode of evangelism. He always had the courage to stand up for certain things than lie down for everything. He objected to snake-charming on the high alter that demeaned the sovereignty of our God.
In so many churches, the sheep look up and are not fed. The biggest problem in the church is insubordination in the ranks after ordination. They work for desks and chairs for peace, justice, reconciliation, culture and other concepts and international non-governmental organisations, but not for the church and its people, the sheep.
Rev. Fr. Gamini called his own sheep by name, and led them.....and his sheep followed him and they knew his voice. (St. John 10: 3,4). He went in search of them and saved them. As a person who had cultivated quiet moments with God, he never wanted attention or sympathy during illness. In God he was strong. (That is why in Christ's sake I delight, in weakness, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, and in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong. - 2 Corinthians 12:10).
It was heartening to see beggar Rathnapala of Nugegoda (who had lost both his legs from the hip) coming to see Rev. Fr. Gamini (even without a wheelchair), who was on the second floor at Sri Jayawardanapura General Hospital, under treatment. It was Fr. Gamini who bathed him and cared for him when he was on the road.
Before Rev. Fr. Gamini's death, he ordered and paid for a small casket. He showed me his monument that was to be placed at the burial grounds at Baddegama, with the words, Beggar of God and a friend of the beggars. He was ready to meet the Master. I was fortunate to learn under the feet of such a pastor who followed my Master. He went to be with the Lord on September 3, 1999.
It seems that 1 Corinthians Chapter 4 Verses 14 and 15 were really written by Rev. Fr. Gamini to all of us who loves him: Even though you have 10,000 guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your father, through the Gospel. Therefore I urge you to imitate me.
Yes, Rev. Fr. Gamini, we solemnly pledge to do that on your 85th birth anniversary. May you rest in peace, arise in glory, and cheer us up on the day of the Lord.
Prabhath Gamalathge

Alec Robertson
Devout dhamma propagator
It has been 16 years since Alec Robertson; preacher, writer and broadcaster of the dhamma and one-time Member of Parliament; passed away.
Alec Robertson was born in Gampola on October 30, 1928, and died on December 31, 2002, at the age of 74. His career life was dedicated mainly to the Buddhist cause: propagating the dhamma through talks, discussions, books, and articles in Buddhist journals and newspapers.
One of his most significant contributions was the popularisation of the weekly dhamma discussions in English at Maitri Hall, Lauries Road, Bambalapitiya. He was closely associated with the Servants of the Buddha Society, which has conducted Buddhist discussions on Saturday evenings for almost half a century.
He started taking part in these meetings while he was still at school. He became the societys Assistant Secretary when he was just 21 years. Later, he became the secretary before serving as its president for an uninterrupted 30 years, from 1969.
He relinquished this office only when he realised that declining health would not permit him to discharge the duties of this office effectively. But he continued to be associated with the society as its adviser until his demise.
His voice and personality reverberated in the Maitri Hall, where he chaired the societys meetings and gave a dhamma talk every first Saturday of the month. When the scheduled speaker could not turn up, Alec Robertson would give the talk himself, often asking the audience to suggest a topic.
Robertson had a prodigious memory. His knowledge of the dhamma was extensive, based on his studies of Pali, the dhamma, the abhidhamma, and commentaries, as well as through his association with Buddhist scholars, monks, and laymen.
Robertson was also for many years associated with broadcasting, giving dhamma talks on the radio and participating in dhamma radio discussions. For several decades he participated in one of the most popular Buddhist radio programmes at that time, namely the Buddhist Forum. In this forum, a number of Buddhist scholars discuss various aspects of the dhamma and entertain subjects for discussions from listeners.
Apart from Robertson, participants in the forum at that time included former Supreme Court Judge late S.R. Wijayatilake and dedicated Buddhist worker late Austin De Silva. Robertson became the Chairman of the Buddhist Forum later and continued to perform the task, except for brief intervals, until his death, a period of two and half a decades.
As a writer, Robertson had many Buddhist publications to his credit. These include the Buddhist Attitude to Christianity, Nibbana  Happiness Supreme, The Triple Gem, and the Uposatha and Buddha  the Healer Incomparable. He also regularly contributed articles to the newspapers, Buddhist journals and the Buddhist annual Vesak Sirisara.
Although known largely as a promoter of the dhamma among English-speaking people, Alec Robertson also had a good command of the Sinhala language. As a young man, he travelled to different parts of the country giving talks, usually in Sinhala, at the invitation of Buddhist organisations in the outstations.
He strove, at all times, to share his knowledge about the latent power held within the human mind. His messages were directed at awakening people to recognise this great untapped and unseen capacity within them and to introduce the teachings of the dhamma as the path to greater self-awareness. Robertson masterfully used the dhamma to explain the most abstract concepts such as the doctrine of impermanence that has even posed challenges to Western psychologists. Robertson was well read in the discipline of Western psychology. He openly challenged eminent western scholars such as Dr. J.B. Reihn's conceptualisation of the human mind as inconclusive on the strength of the deeper understanding he had developed through the teachings of the dhamma. Continually asserting his belief that the Lord Buddha has been the greatest ever psychologist the world has ever seen. His outstanding services in the cause of the dhamma were recognised by the State when the J.R. Jayawardene administration conferred on him the title of. Later, the Premadasa government appointed him a Member of Parliament.
He served for five years as an MP, focusing largely on Buddhism, social welfare and education. The United National Party (UNP) assigned him to the Avissawella electorate, and his addresses to the constituents were mainly on the dhamma and its practice.
In recognition of the yeomen service rendered to the nation and Buddha sasana by the well-known propagator and preacher of the dhamma, Alec Robertson, a commemorative stamp was issued on October 30, 2013, under the National Heroes category. This was arranged to mark his 85th birth anniversary.
Robertson pursued his mission in life with determination, courage, and commitment. May his onward journey in Samsara be smooth and brief, and may he attain early the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.

Kenneth Perera
Beloved and sincere friend
Death is so sad and painful. It leaves the living with a loss that can never be replaced.
I pen these lines as a mark of respect to a great friend. It has been nearly four months since Kenneth passed away, putting everybody who knew him to grief and misery. The fateful day; September 4, 2018; was an extremely sad day to hear that he was no more. I have lost a genuine and sincere friend of exceptional calibre. His 71st birth anniversary falls on January 4, so let this be a tribute to him.
He was smart, always attired in a simple way and was also so cheerful and unassuming that his colleagues admired him greatly. All who knew him will forever remember the charming manners that he carried in his successful life. He has left a memory so beautiful which will not fade away with the passing of time.
He was a dearly loved husband, father and a friend. The illness took his life was a long and challenging one. His wife, Priyani, took great care of him with lots of affection and empathy in the absence of his son Milinda, who is in Australia.
She told me that, when Kenneth was at Maharagama Apeksha Hospital, Kenneth was well-looked after by the doctors and the nurses in ward No. 22, as well as the paying ward. Priyani said that Kenneth really enjoyed the friendliness and the kindness of all the staff from doctors, ward sisters, nurses and right down to the attendants.
Though I did not witness their actions, I wish to commend them for their dedication to duty on behalf of my beloved friend. I pray that you are celebrating your birthday in heaven and that heaven is all what we dreamed it to be. It has been almost four months since you left us. As your birthday approaches for the first time, I look at it with dread. I can't go and pore over birthday cards or select a gift, but so many happy memories of years gone by and the happy times we had celebrating your birthday. Its tough and I am left wishing that I had at least one more.
So, my dear friend, until we meet again and celebrate your birthday, I remain. May your soul rest in peace.
Your ever-loving friend, Lalin

Dr. Nadarajah Sivananthan
A compassionate doctor
Friends old and new were among the many who gathered at the Hendon Crematorium in London, to pay their last respects to the much-loved Dr. Nadarajah Sivananthan who passed away on November 27.
Siva was the firstborn to late Dr. Nadarajah and late Maheswary Nadarajah of Urumpirai, Jaffna.
The orations delivered at the funeral bear testimony to Sivas personality.
He was a kind doctor, affectionate husband, dedicated father, much-respected sibling and good friend to many who came across him. In fact, Dr. Siva epitomised his chosen vocation of service to mankind.
Despite the passage of time, some five decades on, I can vividly remember our first meeting at Royal College in the year 1967. A debonair teenager presenting himself immaculately dressed in the school uniform. Displaying his trademark smile, there was a charm and aura about him!
He was obsessively self-disciplined as a schoolboy; punctual, obedient and always focused with an intent to aim high with an ambition to enter the medical profession. At school, Siva was a model scholar who not only complied with the school motto of disce aut discede, but went even further, to proposita consequi.
Although we went in different directions on leaving the school we were destined to re-establish our acquaintance in the UK around the year 1984. Erudite and Intelligent he was gentle, never uttered a word of hatred even amidst the worst of adversity. I vividly recall my conversation with him in the aftermath of the 1983 civil unrest in Sri Lanka when our discussion centred around the well-being of his parents and siblings in Colombo. There was a pause when I could sense his distress but no outburst of emotions.
Instead, he appeared resigned with forgiving words towards the arsonists who set fire to his house forcing his parents and siblings to flee for their lives! That was Siva.
Many of his qualities appear to be derived from his father, the late Nadarajah whom I first met at an awards ceremony in his capacity as at the President of the Western Province Tamil Teachers Association. Nadarajah was the Head at the Vivekananda Maha Vidyalayam in Colombo. An indefatigable community worker, Nadarajah also served as a Features Editor at the popular Tamil daily Thinakaran.
Siva qualified as a doctor in 1975 and was posted to the General Hospital Ratnapura as a pre-registration trainee. On completion of this post, he was appointed as a medical officer at Ruwanwella and Colombo Hospitals.
He married Manju in 1979. On completion of his compulsory service to the Government of Sri Lanka, he travelled to the UK, where he received further specialist training upon qualifying for the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians (MRCP) examination in London.
Sivas intention was to return to his motherland Sri Lanka as a specialist physician to serve his people, but the dark hours of 1983 and the political turmoil that followed compelled him to give up his lifelong ambition but set up practice in the UK.
Lankas loss was UKs gain. He entered General Practice in Gloucester, where he served his patients with utmost professionalism and compassion.
Dr. Siva served the National Health Service for over 36 years, treating people from all walks of life with distinction. He was loved by all his patients and his caring attitude to those who sought his help was a special feature in attracting many patients towards his practice.
Below are some excerpts from a testimony from one of his patients:
A really lovely practice, receptionists friendly and very approachable, and lovely nurses. Dr. Siva was a man I trusted implicitly with my healthcare and that of my sons.
Embedded in these words are many of Sivas qualities, including his organisational skills and, more importantly, his dignified and holistic approach to his patients. Sivas services to his patients could not have been achieved without the dedication of his wife Manju who was a tower of strength to Siva not only as a life partner, but also as the administrator of his medical practice.
Siva retired in 2016, taking an interest in travelling and music while spending more time with his grandchild.
His retirement was cut short following a brief period of illness, but he faced his final days with courage and fortitude with the help of Manju and their children.
He passed away peacefully in Hospital with his wife and children by the bedside. He is survived by his wife, children Nayana and Arun, two grandchildren, and six siblings.
No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after his death. - Plato.

Create a relaxing garden
Being out in nature is a great way to rejuvenate the mind and body. According to research, nature offers mental benefits such as improved memory, restored mental energy, and stress relief. Being outside can also make you feel better as it reduces inflammation and has possible anti-cancer effects. However, you dont have to go hiking in the woods to enjoy the health benefits of naturesimply being out in your backyard or garden can improve your well-being if your outdoor space is conducive to relaxation. To improve your space and give it a serene vibe, follow these tips to design a relaxing garden.
Create sitting areas throughout the garden
You dont have to limit your sitting area to your patio or deck. Create several sitting areas throughout your garden so you can spend time in different parts of your outdoor space with family or by yourself. Place an outdoor stone or wooden bench under a tree and have a few sturdy chairs beside greenery. Dont go for steel or glass chairs as you want to keep the look as organic and natural as can be.
Add a water element
Adding a water element can create a peaceful ambiance in your garden. You can have an outdoor water fountain, a small koi pond, or even a tabletop water garden to give your garden a fresh feel. You can also place a bench near these areas so you can enjoy the sound of running water at your leisure.
Plant flowers and herbs with pleasant scents
Using all your senses as you spend time in your garden can help you relax, and that includes your sense of smell. Plant roses, honeysuckle, and jasmine, which give off pleasant and slightly perfumey scents. You can also grow an aromatic herb garden so you can enjoy the smell of licorice, basil, mint, and lavender while walking or sitting in your garden.
Choose plants with soothing shades
Its a known fact that seeing certain colors can affect our mood. For instance, a fiery red shade can increase your heart rate and increase stress levels, while shades of pale blue and green can lower blood pressure and makes you feel more tranquil. When choosing plants, stick to a soothing color palette such as white (white hyacinth), soft pinks (hydrangea or carnation), and blue (cornflower, grape hyacinth, or blue crocus).Designing your outdoor space to make it more serene can benefit your health and well-being.

Disgraced Bancroft out third ball on return from ban
Melbourne, Sunday: A nervous Cameron Bancrofts return from his nine-month ban for ball-tampering did not go to plan Sunday when he was out to the third ball he faced in the Big Bash League.
The disgraced 26-year-old was picked in the Perth Scorchers team despite only having played club cricket since he was caught trying to use sandpaper to alter the ball in Australias Test against South Africa in Cape Town in March.
He came in at number four after the Hobart Hurricanes had reduced the Scorchers to 16-3 and played the first ball off his pads to square leg for two.
Bancroft blocked another one before getting an edge off Riley Meredith to Matthew Wade behind the stumps.
Despite his quick exit, he was applauded by the crowd at Launceston in Tasmania as he trudged off.
Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting, who was commentating on the game, said he spoke to Bancroft beforehand and he was really, really nervous.
He was a little bit worried about the pace these boys might be bowling at him as hes only played club cricket for the past few months, he said.
He said to me that even going out on this wicket hes sure everything was going feel like its a Test match at the WACA, said Ponting, referring to the notoriously quick Perth ground. Along with Bancroft, then-Australian captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner were banned for a year over their part in the tampering scandal.
Their suspensions run out in late March. Bancroft re-emerged into public life with an explosive television interview last week in which he confirmed Warner asked him to rough up the ball. He claimed he went along with it to fit in and because he didnt know any better.
Bancroft also said he almost gave up cricket to become a yoga teacher in the darkest days of his exile. AFP

Ex-EDB Employees honoured
The establishment of Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB), in 1979 was a fulfillment of a national need for an institutional framework for the development and promotion of exports with the introduction of a market-oriented economy by the Government in the mid nineteen seventies.
The main goal was to develop products and services from Sri Lanka to present to the giant world market transferring from import substitution economy to an export oriented economy which was a huge challenge as it needed removal of barrier for export trade, development of new export products, adding value to existing exports, expansion of existing markets, penetration into new markets. At the 5th AGM of Ex-EDB Employees Sansadaya where all retired and left, met up with the present staff at the EDB Auditorium, the four top pillars who were also members of Sansadaya were honoured by the gesture of handing over of plaques to complement their dedicated steadfast commitments rendered towards the Sri Lankas apex organisation (EDB).
Late Lalith Athulathmudali, who honoured by entrusting the steering wheel of this immaculate ship to commence its journey to late Victor Santiapillai, appointing him as the first Chairman.
At the presentation of Export Development Board Bill in Parliament in 1979, as recorded in the Hansard replying to a question, he had said, Chairman is Victor Santiapillai, the Executive Director of UNCTAD  GATT ITC with world wide experience on the subject. I thought he was the best man to be influenced for his contribution to the benefit of the Motherland.
The plaque was taken over by representative of his son Manik Santiapillai on behalf of the demised Victor Santiapillai.
The prestigious second plaque was honoured to S. Kulatunga seasoned administrator from the SLAS who held hands on the steering wheel of the EDB ship in 1979 with late Santiapillai being the 1st Director General who drafted the Export Promotion Bill, continued until his retirement while being the Additional Secretary of the Ministry.
They made a great pair and the EDB soon became a most respected and viable organisation fulfilling the aspirations of the founder, Minister Athulathmudali. He later became a Consultant of ITC (UNCTAD/WTO). The third plaque was honoured to Dr. K.U. Kamalgoda being the third Director General from SLAS, joining the EDB in 1990 till 1994.
Some of the key events organized during his period at the EDB was Sri Lanka Expo 1994, setting up of the Sri Lanka World Trade Centre in Fort, where our Sri Lankan products were eyed easily by importers. Later he became Chairmen and Managing Director of several Govt organisations and presently he is the President and Governor of Asia Marketing Federation.
The fourth plaque was honoured to Lalith Hettiarachchi being the fourth Director General from SLAS joining the EDB in mid 1990s.
He held leading positions in several public sector organisation. He was the Ambassador for Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi-UAE, the Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board, Secretary Ministry of Fisheries and today he holds the position of Director at Nawaloka Construction Co. (Pvt) Ltd.

First Capital Research optimistic
The re-appointment of pre-October 26 Government and passing of the Vote of Account in Parliament, and with the political uncertainty that prevailed over the last 8 weeks easing off, has provided financial capability for the Government and its institutions to function beyond 2018 according to a report by First Capital Research.
Over the last 3 months (25-Sep to 24-Dec) weve maintained exposure at 50% considering earnings hit via depreciation and political unrest affecting sentiment of the market. However, during the period market gained by about 100-120 index points.
As we step into 2019, we are witnessing the global fund flow reversing towards Asia and commodity prices crashing with the dip in oil prices benefiting the BoP position of Sri Lanka and positively affecting Cost of Living.
We believe the events that have unfolded may benefit Sri Lanka and the equity market over the next few months positively impacting earnings and possibly leading to net foreign inflows.
Thereby, we upgrade our equity exposure to 60% and upgrade ASPI volatility expectations to 6,000-6,500 (from our previous 5,800 6,200), the report adds.

Five-star Liverpool thrash Arsenal, Spurs stunned by Wolves
LIVERPOOL, Saturday - Liverpool extended their Premier League lead to nine points as Roberto Firminos hat-trick hammered Arsenal 5-1 at Anfield, while Tottenhams title challenge crumbled in a 3-1 home defeat to Wolves.
Manchester City could cut Liverpools lead to seven points when they look to stop a recent slump at Southampton on Sunday, but ahead of their trip to the Etihad on January 3, Jurgen Klopps men currently look well on course to deliver a first league title since 1989/90.
For sure Tottenhams result people out there reacted, but not inside the dressing room where they were completely concentrated on the match and not allowed to have that influence on our game, said Klopp.
That is how I want the team to stay which is to be concentrated, nothing else.
Liverpool even overcame a rare deficit on home soil as for the first time this season after they trailed in the league at Anfield when Ainsley Maitland-Niles swept Arsenal into an 11th minute lead.
However, the hosts were level within three minutes and 4-1 up by half-time as Firmino struck twice in two minutes before Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salahs penalty made the points safe before the break.
Salah then passed up the chance to move out in front as the leagues top scorer after drawing level with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Harry Kane on 13 as he allowed Firmino to take Liverpools second penalty of the evening 25 minutes from time to complete the Brazilians hat-trick.
SPURS STUMBLE
Tottenham had surged ahead of City into second place after smashing 11 goals past Everton and Bournemouth in the previous six days, but ran out of steam at Wembley as Wolves scored three times in the final 18 minutes.
A wonderful moment of individual skill from Kane put Spurs on course for a sixth straight league when he cut inside onto his weaker left foot, but still produced a powerful drive from 20 yards that beat Rui Patricio midway through the first half.
However, much has been made of Tottenham coach Mauricio Pochettinos ability to extract the most from a stretched squad and Spurs finally looked like a side jaded by competing on four fronts in the final stages.
We have had a very good run in the last few weeks and to keep that level is difficult, said Pochettino. I think we started to pay for the effort in the other games. We are not machines.
The comeback began when Willy Boly rose highest to meet Joao Moutinhos corner to equalise.
As the hosts pressed for a winner, Wolves broke in numbers and Raul Jimenez put the visitors in front six minutes from time before Helder Costa raced clear to score his first Premier League goal.
I WANT TO KILL HIM
Fulham are now just a point away from safety after Aleksandar Mitrovic saved Aboubakar Kamaras blushes, but not the wrath of manager Claudio Ranieri.
The Frenchman ignored Ranieris orders to let Mitrovic take a late penalty with the scores still tied a 0-0 and saw his effort saved by Jonas Lossl.
I said to Aboubakar Kamara to leave the ball to Mitrovic, he is the man who shoots the penalties, said Ranieri. It is unbelievable, he did not respect me, the club, the team and crowd. I spoke with him, it is not right.
I want to kill him, that is normal when one man takes a ball, only because he scored the last penalty (against Manchester United). It should be Mitrovic, that is it.
A missed penalty was also the turning point at the King Power where Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge saved James Maddisons spot-kick for Leicester.
And Cardiff snatched a first away win of the season in stoppage time when Victor Camarasa unleashed a rocket to move the Welsh side four points clear of the relegation zone with a 1-0 victory.
Brighton also boosted their survival chances by beating Everton 1-0 thanks to Jurgen Locadias solitary goal.
Newcastle are also four points above the drop zone after they were denied a vital three points by Abdoulaye Doucoures late equaliser for Watford in a 1-1 draw at Vicarage Road after Salomon Rondon had opened the scoring. - AFP

Melstacorp followed suit, accounting for 22.89% of turnover (value of LKR 0.39Bn) while JKH contributed LKR 0.15Bn to account for 8.93% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 1.72Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 8.46Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.43Bn (-74.53% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 1.69Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, increased by +0.16% W-o-W (or LKR 4.50Bn) to LKR 2,822.02Bn cf. LKR 2,817.53Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms) 
The Banks, Finance & Insurance sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 54.20% (or LKR 0.93Bn) of market turnover. Sector turnover was driven primarily Ceylinco Insurance, Commercial Bank, NDB, Sampath Bank & Janashakthi Insurance which accounted for 93.42% of the sectors total turnover.
The Diversified sector meanwhile accounted for 41.07% (or LKR 0.71Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Melstacorp, JKH, Hemas Holdings & Softlogic which accounted for 98.94% of the sector turnover.

In terms of volume, Melstacorp & Softlogic led foreign purchases while JKH & Renuka Agri led foreign sales. In terms of value, Melstacorp & Softlogic led foreign purchases while JKH & Hemas Holdings led foreign sales.
Point of view 
Sri Lankan equities gained marginally ( 9.6 index points) over the holiday-shortened week, with retail investors in particular remaining largely on the sidelines during the week.
On Monday, the benchmark index gained 19 points (+ 0.3%), but lost 10 points over the remainder of the week to end at 6,015.23 (0.16% W-o-W gain). This weeks gain (albeit marginal) was the 1st week-on-week gain in two weeks and, despite the political impasse that dominated the early part of the month, the ASPI has remained staunchly above the psychological mark of 6000 points throughout Dec18.
However, activity levels remained subdued with average daily activity levels hitting an 11-week low of Rs.0.4Bn this week, and helping push the overall activity levels on the Colombo Bourse over 2018 down to Rs.0.8Bn (cf. average daily turnover levels of Rs.0.9Bn recorded in 2017).
With Retail investors opting to remain on the sidelines this week, Local institutions and HNIs accounted for 70% of total market activity, with buying interest focused mainly on Ceylinco Insurance (64% of crossings) and Melsta Corp (31% of crossings).
Foreign investors meanwhile returned to Sri Lankan equities for the 1st time since Mid-Nov18, with foreign investors remaining net buyers to the tune of Rs.264Mn (cf. net buying position of Rs. 130Mn in Nov18).
Domestic equity performance in 2018 so far has remained volatile, with the ASPI losing 5.6% over the year (cf. 2.3% gain recorded in 2017) as i) sluggish economic conditions and heightened political uncertainty domestically and, ii) volatile financial markets globally have affected equities negatively.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to look cues both from the CBSLs roadmap of Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2019 & beyond and from ongoing economic and political developments.
Policy rates held steady despite subdued growth 
At its final Monetary Policy Review for the year, Sri Lankas Central Bank held policy rates steady (SLFR 9%: SDFR-8%) noting that despite sub-par growth and subdued inflation, its decision is warranted by higher private sector credit growth and continued pressure on the countrys external reserves.
The move to maintain rates is in contrast to last month when the CBSL reduced the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) by 1.50p.p to address low rupee liquidity in the system whilst simultaneously increasing the SDFR and SLFR rates (by 75 and 50 bps respectively) to neutralise the impact of the SRR reduction.
The Monetary Authority noted that economic growth continues to remain weak (Q318 GDP growth was 2.9% Y-o-Y cf. 3.6% Y-o-Y in Q218), with Q418 growth also expected to remain subdued, highlighting the urgency of implementing broad-based structural reforms.
However, the uptick in private sector credit growth since Sept18 and pressure on external reserves prompted its decision to hold rates; despite the increased cost of funds and tight liquidity conditions, private sector credit growth rose to 16.2% Y-o-Y in Nov18 (cf. 14.9% Y-o-Y in Jun18) partially due to the private sector advancing its activities in anticipation of measures to curb excessive import growth.
The external sector meanwhile continues to face international and domestic headwinds, with the trade deficit widening further between Jan-Oct18 while workers remittances have slowed and capital markets have experienced consistent net outflows amid tight liquidity conditions globally and excessive speculation domestically.
The LKR has consequently depreciated 15.8% YTD while gross official reserves have fallen to $7Bn cf. $10Bn in Apr18, justifying the CBSLs decision to not reduce rates despite stable inflation levels and subpar GDP growth.

Former OIC in illegal affair attacked
A former OIC of the Suriyawewa Police has been attacked with a weapon on December 28 by occupants of a house in Suriyawewa when the former visited the house to meet a woman who allegedly had an illegal affair with him, Suriyawewa police said.
The injured is a resident of Udakiriella, Ratnapura and he has been interdicted from the service of the Suriyawewa Police. Earlier he had worked (2008-2009) as the OIC of the police station.
He had started the affair while he had been the OIC of the Suriyawewa Police. The husband of the woman had been shot dead by an unidentified person at the time.
The couple had stopped their affair about a year ago, but they have been in disagreement over a monetary issue thereafter. The woman has been evading him and the man was pursing her for many months to get his money back, police said.
He had visited the house recently and inquired about the woman from the occupants. When they responded negatively, the interdicted police officer had clashed with them. In the ensuing clash, the womans father and brother had attached the police officer.
Thereafter, the man had lodged a complaint in the Suriyawewa Police and admitted to the Suriyawewa Hospital. But he had fled the hospital and gone to the womans place again. Then they had attacked him with a sharp implement. Suriyawewa police, on a tip off that the former police officer had fallen near a house in the town bleeding, had arrived at the location and admitted him to the Hambantota Hospital.
The womans father, Dikowita Kakanamge Somadasa (60) and her brother Dikowita Kakanamge Ramesh (22), were arrested and produced before the Suriyawea Magistrate. They were released on Rs. 1 lakh bail each.
Two other court cases against the former OIC that he had deceived a woman promising her to marry her and taking Rs. 31,400 from her and that he had misappropriated a jeep of the police are ongoing at the Hambantota Magistrate Court, police said.
Suriyawewa police are investigating.

Gamata Tech Opens Avenues for  Youth Entrepreneurs
Gamata Technology, an accelerator platform initiated by youth-tech entrepreneurs covering every corner of Sri Lanka was officially launched recently at a ceremony held in Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre.
The event was delegated by young entrepreneurs, leading tech companies, renowned personalities and Locals covering 19 Districts over Sri Lanka.
The concept of Gamata Tech was build based on a research done on technological usage for several years, across Sri Lanka. The research exposed how a high percentage of youth misuse the technology at their hands due to lack of knowledge and empowerment.
The event was also used as an arena to introduce several innovative mobile applications to strengthen the technological revolution in rural areas introduced and innovated by I.C.A.N Advertising.
The applications included Friends Belt (A genuine social media platform suitable to Sri Lanka), Gedarata Plus (A multi-vendor shopping platform from home), Esenin (A taxi app which passengers and drivers use) and Paara.lk (A comprehensive directory). The experienced panelists included Kushil Gunasekara, Founder and the Chief Trustee, Foundation of Goodness, Achala Samaradiwakara, co-founder Good Market, Fathhi Mohamed, Co-founder of PickMe and Yoho Bed, Isura Silva, Consultant, Strategic Management of Sarvodaya Fusion and Dr. Ashan Perera, UN SDG Action Award Winner 2018, Youth Advocate, Social Entrepreneur and Founder of The Road to Rights Youth-Led Organization. The panel was moderated by Dr. Nirmal De Silva, Co founder and CEO of Paramount.
The discussion was built around subjects such as opportunities and challenges of the rural entrepreneurship in SL Responsibility of a society powered with technology; why Sri Lanka needs entrepreneurship, Social entrepreneurship and a wide range of subjects that cover the arena of rural entrepreneurship.
Dr. Ashan Perera commented on the importance of a platform such as Gamata Technology While we were conducting the initial researches, I met many young Sri Lankans who had wonderful innovative ideas; web sites to promote tourism, integrate and notify people and business places, platforms to reach the international audience of historical monuments while being at their own hometowns.
But these innovators lack the technology and the knowledge to execute these ideas. So if we all can take the right technology and right technological resources to the rural areas, we can build our country with these ideas to great heights.
This launch of Gamata technology program, we hope to take the program to the people in all 25 districts. We will be meeting the youth, government officials etc. If we can give the right technological knowledge to these groups, we can find many resources for every industry. These resources are the ones which will change Sri Lanka, strengthen the culture, traditions and the unity we hold. We should identify them. I welcome Business sector, Entrepreneurs, Policy makers to join with us in strengthening them. The people who are behind this program can change the cities, our country and win the world, he added.
Panel discussion
Achala Samaradiwakara, co-founder Good Market mentioned that it is all about using the current issues of the system, and changing the system using technology. Its not always about doing something new, but doing it differently adopting to the context and customers. Co-Founder of PickMe Fathhi Mohamed added. Environment and other social crisis are discussed at every platforms today, and the panelists provided examples on how we can prepare ourselves as a country to face such adversities in the future through social entrepreneurship, by solving the issues in the rural areas, by the youth entrepreneurs, using technology.
Isuru Silva, Consultant, Strategic Management of Sarvodaya Fusion explained how norms and attitudes of education in Sri Lanka has to change. They discussed how as opposed to the popular myth, we can elevate and promote traditions and culture of Sri Lanka through technology.
Many businesses complaint how Sri Lankas market is less competitive as we are limited with a population of 21 million. The panel conversed on how such factors does not matter, as long as a strong business model with flexibility is used. The probability of expanding Sri Lankan initiatives such as Pick Me into the global market was also discussed.

Handy Solutions for year-end resolutions
The New Year is all about new beginnings, a fresh start, the chance to hit the reset button after a season of eating, drinking, and being merry. Ahem, and then eating some more. So its not surprising that come January, many of us feel the need to set some pretty lofty goals. The thing is, only a tiny number of resolution-makers actually achieve them.
It can be daunting when your list of New Years resolutions is as long as your holiday shopping list. In addition to the post-holiday slump, not being able to keep your resolutions by February, March or even late January may increase your anxiety. When your holiday decorations are packed up and stored away, the frustration of what you failed to do or other reminders of failed resolutions can make the later months a period of seeming hopelessness.
However, it is important to remember that the New Year isnt meant to serve as a catalyst for sweeping character changes. It is a time for people to reflect on their past years behaviour and promise to make positive lifestyle changes. It's very easy to make New Year's resolutions in the heat of enthusiasm and glowing joy but most of us are more familiar with the difficulty of sticking to them.
It is possible but it does take quite some focus, planning, and a determination to stick with the resolutions for the same amount of time it takes to change a habit, so that the resolutions also turn into new habits. Actually, setting small, attainable goals throughout the year, instead of a singular, overwhelming goal on January 1 can help you reach whatever it is you are striving for. That is because it is not the extent of the change that matters, but rather the act of recognising that lifestyle change is important and working toward it, is best taken one step at a time.
By making your resolutions realistic, there is a greater chance that you will keep them throughout the year, incorporating healthy behaviour into your everyday life. People change with time, so do their aspirations. Making resolutions is a purification rite of self appraisal and penitence that demands personal honesty and ultimately, reinforces humility.
Breaking them is part of the cycle. But in the estimation of the less sardonic souls among us the New Year is a great era for everyone. It is the start of a new beginning. It can also be the start of a new life if the right resolutions are made and kept.
However, it is also a pretty funny time of year in a way. People often make resolutions they dont keep and do some pretty silly things at midnight. Some take it seriously. Some bid it farewell just after the clock strikes twelve.
Some call it a second chance to dream with eyes open. Seriously taken, New Year resolutions are an opportunity to measure our goals. For the adventurous soul, it is the opportunity to tickle a funny bone or to try something bold.
It is also a time to look where you stand. For those who have made all kinds of declarations last New Years Eve should take time to reflect how far they have stood by them. If not, it is time you did! The most practical thing to do is to get down to accomplishing the incomplete decisions. If you still feel that the resolutions you made last year and abandoned mid-way are worth a second shot, give them another chance!
And be sure they are realistic resolutions. Instead of weaving dreams in the air make a decision that would have significance that adds meaning to your life. Resolve this year to monitor how far you are holding on to your commitment, it will help you to hang on.
Many people resolve to quit an addiction. If it does you no good, why stick to it If needed, seek help of support groups or professionals. If you have the will, you shall find the way. For many of us it would be a sagacious move to go back to school, so to say. Learning has no age limit. Pick up where you left off. Fit in a fitness programme that ensures a future with fewer trips to the doctor. Select an exercise regime you can stick to. A group activity may add the element of fun to the routine. Lose some flab. But dont set any strict targets or attempt to over extend a schedule. Chances are that over enthusiasm may make the going too tough and de-motivate you to quit.
Soaking up new skills, learning something new and interesting is always fun and a value addition too. Try to stop pigging out. Eating to live and not living to eat should be the aim. Yet dont deny yourself the occasional indulgence.
Endeavour to lose the loan that keeps niggling at your mind and causing stress. Pay off any debt you may have and feel light at heart.
One element that can make you feel better and help you sleep better at night is to contribute to a charitable cause. Giving back to society is the least we can do to make the world a better place to live in.
Learn to liven up your lifestyle. Certainly, paying attention to your professional growth is fine, but your personal life requires attention too. Strike a balance. Try to be organised in everything you do and pay attention to the smallest detail. That is the key to make life easier, manage time and live stress free. Make a proper to-do list, and you will be half way there already.
Unhealthy habits develop over the course of time. As such, replacing such behaviour with better ones requires time. Dont get overwhelmed and think that you have to reassess everything in your life. Instead, work toward changing one thing at a time.
Dont strive to be a perfectionist. Perfection is unattainable in any human endeavour. Remember that minor missteps when reaching your goals are completely normal and acceptable. Dont give up completely or feel guilty if you indulged in a sinful pudding or dessert and broke your diet or skipped your exercise regime because you were busy. We all have our ups and downs. Simply resolve to recover from your lapses and get back on track.
But there are many out there who start getting real about resolutions. Instead of setting their sights on one meteoric milestone, they begin shifting their focus to the smaller things that can add up to make a major, lasting impact on overall health and happiness.

Sri Lanka crushed by 423 runs lose series 1-0
How cool is that Williamson reflects on NZs record win
CHRISTCHURCH, Sunday - New Zealand celebrate a historic victory Sunday when they needed just 14 balls on day five to demolish Sri Lanka by a colossal 423 runs in the second Test in Christchurch.
Thats quite a cool thing to achieve, skipper Kane Williamson said, reflecting on New Zealand winning a fourth consecutive series for the first time in their 88-year Test history.
Thats wasnt the focus, and if we do reflect on that a little bit, the positives of the different conditions weve experienced, the different opposition all come into the fact weve been able to get across the line and that makes it quite special.
The victory over Sri Lanka, by the biggest ever margin for New Zealand and eighth largest of all time in terms of runs, followed back-to-back series wins against the West Indies, England and Pakistan this year.
Sri Lanka, having been set an improbable 660-run target, resumed the final day at 231 for six and lost their first wicket with the third ball of the morning when Trent Boult bowled Suranga Lakmal for 18.
Neil Wagner removed Dilruwan Perera for 22 before Boult ended the innings with the wicket of Dushmantha Chameera in the third over of the morning.
Angelo Mathews, who retired hurt when on 22 on Saturday, did not resume his innings.
After a placid pitch and rain saved Sri Lanka in the first Test in Wellington, the weather and wicket in Christchurch were ideal for the decider.
Sri Lanka won the toss and had New Zealand six for 64 before a whirlwind 68 from man-of-the-match Tim Southee lifted New Zealand to 178.
Sri Lanka were cruising towards that target until a purple patch from Trent Boult whose six wickets for four runs wiped out the lower order and the tourists were all out for 104.
KEY MOMENT
Tom Lathams 176 and an unbeaten 162 by Henry Nicholls saw New Zealand declare at 585 for four in their second innings, leaving Sri Lanka more than two days to survive.
When Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal were at the crease they had a faint hope, but a stunning catch by Matt Henry broke the stubborn partnership.
That was the key moment, Williamson said of Henrys diving catch at extra cover to remove Mendis for 67 off the bowling of Neil Wagner to end a 53-over stand.
The remaining seven batsmen only lasted 50 overs in total and contributed 110 runs.
He came on and perhaps being a sub fielder youre not quite feeling the rhythm of the game and it can be disruptive, Williamson said.
Perhaps he was in the right position or the wrong position, we dont know, but it went to him and he was fresh as and it was kinda cool.
Wagner, who had struggled for wickets earlier in the series, found the Christchurch conditions to his liking and took four for 48.
Boult finished with three for 77.
Sri Lanka captain Chandimal blamed his sides disappointing efforts from his batsmen in the first innings of both Tests.
We just have to improve, he said as Sri Lanka prepare for three one-dayers and a Twenty20 against New Zealand before moving to series in Australia and then South Africa.  AFP

India mop up Australia tail to win Third Test by 137 runs
MELBOURNE, Sunday - A clinical India mopped up Australias tail to win the third Test in Melbourne on Sunday by 137 runs and take an unassailable 2-1 lead into the final clash at Sydney.
The home team resumed at 258 for eight after the morning session was wiped out by rain in their unlikely quest to hunt down a huge 399, which would have been a record fourth-innings chase at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
No team before had made more than 332 to win, and that was in 1928 by England.
But they fell well short of the target, with Jasprit Bumrah taking the key wicket of dogged Pat Cummins and Ishant Sharma snaring Nathan Lyon to secure the emphatic win.
India, the worlds top-ranked nation, are now zeroing in on a first-ever series win Down Under in Sydney later this week, where they only need a draw to smash the long-time jinx.
It is a feat that skipper Virat Kohli has so publicly coveted since his team men arrived in Australia last month.
Tailender Cummins, who is rapidly proving himself to a very capable all-rounder, some even say a future Australia captain, had kept his side in the hunt with an impressive 61 not out on Saturday.
But he only added two more to be out for a career-best 63 to follow his career-best 6-27 with the ball and be one of the few successes for Australia. Lyon added just one to his overnight total.
Paceman Jasprit Bumrah finished with 3-53, following his six-wicket first innings haul, and left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja 3-82.
Cummins aside, no other Australian passed 50 in Melbourne, exposing their lack of batting depth and reinforcing how much they are missing the banned Steve Smith and David Warner.
The pairs year-long suspensions for ball-tampering run out in late March and it is widely believed that they will be reintegrated quickly into the team.
In contrast, India were disciplined with the rock solid number three Cheteshwar Pujara scoring another century in the first innings and Kohli showing restraint and composure, while debutant Mayank Agarwal impressed at the top of the order with 76 in his first Test knock. The bedrock for Indias victory was their 443 for seven declared in the first innings, built on the back of Pujaras 106 and Kohlis 82.
Spearheaded by the young Bumrah, who reinforced his reputation as one of the worlds top bowlers, Australia were then skittled for just 151.
Kohli declared Indias second innings on 106 for eight, leaving Australia the virtual mission impossible of scoring 399 to win or surviving almost two days for a draw. Aaron Finch again flopped at the top of the order, throwing his role as a Test opener under more scrutiny with growing speculation that he will be axed.
He played a poor shot to Bumrah and was caught by Kohli for three.
Fellow opener Marcus Harris followed him back to the pavilion for 13 with Usman Khawaja the next to go after a lively 33.
When Shaun Marsh was also trapped leg before by Bumrah for a brisk 44 and his brother Mitch -- another candidate for the Sydney chop -- fell for 10, Australias faint survival hopes were fading fast.
Travis Head put up some resistance with a battling 34 before his stumps were knocked over by Ishant Sharma and when skipper Tim Paine went for 26 it appeared all but over -- until Cummins dug in to take the game into a fifth day. - AFP

CB keeps policy rates unchanged
Inflation to remain below 5%, GDP to pick up in 2019
The Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, at its last meeting decided to maintain policy interest rates at their current levels.
Accordingly, the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank will remain at 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.
The Board considered current and expected developments in the domestic economy and the domestic financial markets as well as the global economic environment, with the broad aim of stabilising inflation at mid single digit levels in the medium term to enable the economy to achieve its potential growth.
As per the provisional estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the Sri Lankan economy recorded a modest real GDP growth of 2.9 per cent, year-on-year, during the third quarter of 2018, compared to the revised growth of 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2018. As per the available economic indicators and other economic developments, real GDP growth is likely to be low in the fourth quarter of 2018 as well, before picking up gradually in 2019.
The continued low economic growth reemphasises the need for implementing broad based structural reforms without further delay.
The reduction of the Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) at the last monetary policy review in November 2018 released around Rs. 90 billion of rupee liquidity to the banking system. However, the liquidity deficit has widened thereafter, and the Central Bank continued its open market operations (OMOs) cautiously to manage liquidity on overnight, short term and long term basis as appropriate.
In spite of the increased cost of funds and tight liquidity conditions, the year-on-year growth of credit to the private sector accelerated since September 2018, partly reflecting the private sector advancing its activities in anticipation of measures by the government and the Central Bank to curb excessive import growth.
Headline inflation, based on both the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI) and the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI), and remained in low single digit levels. Core inflation also remained subdued thus far in 2018.
Recent downward adjustments to fuel prices and selected administratively determined prices, as well as the reduction of Special Commodity and telecommunication levies, along with the ongoing recovery in the agriculture sector are expected to impact favourably on inflation in the near term.
Volatile global commodity prices, possible weather related disruptions to domestic supply chains due to unpredictable weather patterns, and the possible pass-through of the effect of the rupee depreciation in recent months to domestic prices pose risks to the inflation outlook.
The current projections show that inflation, on average, will remain below 5 per cent in 2019 and stabilise in the range of 4-6 per cent thereafter with appropriate policy adjustments.
The trade deficit widened further in the first ten months of 2018 with the expansion in import expenditure outpacing the growth of export earnings. However, a moderation in import expenditure is expected, in response to the measures adopted to curb imports of motor vehicles and non-essential goods as well as the impact of the depreciation of the rupee.
While earnings from tourism continued to grow, a slowdown in workers remittances was observed. In the financial account, both the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange experienced net outflows of foreign investment, although marginal inflows have been observed in December.
The widening trade deficit, tight conditions in the global markets and excessive speculation in the domestic market exerted pressure on the exchange rate, and the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 15.9 per cent against the US dollar thus far during 2018 up to 27 December.
Meanwhile, gross official reserves amounted to US dollars 7 billion at end November 2018, providing an import cover of 3.7 months.
Although inflation remains subdued and economic growth remains below potential, the Monetary Board was of the view that it is appropriate to continue the current monetary policy stance to stabilise overall economic conditions and domestic financial markets in a context where there has been an uptick in private sector credit as well as continued pressure on external reserves.
Accordingly, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels.

Just put down your phone
Earlier this year, Apple and Google announced features in their forthcoming mobile operating systems designed to reduce interruptions and manage screen time.
Android and iOS users alike will soon be able to guard their sleep against digital temptations, easily activate Do Not Disturb mode when needed, and get prompted to stop when they have used their favorite apps beyond a personally chosen time limit.
As a psychological scientist who has been studying the effects of mobile technology on well-being for the past five years, I can only welcome these new tools.
Indeed, a great deal of research has documented how smartphones might be harming peoples sleep quality or distracting them from nondigital activities.
In my own experimental research, my collaborators and I have found consistent evidence that smartphones can also distract users from the family and friends right in front of them, such as when sharing a meal or spending time with their children.
In situations that clearly call for limiting digital distraction  like playtime with kids  Apples and Googles new tools will offer a convenient solution. Yet, my research suggests that smartphones may be making us less happy in a much wider range of social situations than we might expect.
The limitations of choice
The crux of the matter is that people, as it turns out, fail to judge what economists call opportunity costs  the value of what someone gives up when they make a choice to do one thing and not another.
For example, in a series of studies I conducted with Jason Proulx and Elizabeth Dunn at the University of British Columbia, we found that people neglect a key side effect of relying on their phones for information: They miss out on chances to boost their sense of social connectedness.
Using a mobile map app, for example, obviates the need to rely on other people, removing the opportunity to experience the kindness of a stranger who helpfully provides directions to a store or movie theater.
Speak with people
It is easy to see how completely forgoing social interaction for technological convenience can hurt someones social well-being.
But most people use their phones precisely to socialize  often while simultaneously socializing with others in person. Perhaps its having a drink with a co-worker while also Snapchatting with a friend, texting with a partner, or even setting up a new date through Tinder or Grindr.
One may think that socializing with more people simultaneously is better.
But my collaborator, Samantha Heintzelman, and I recently found that combining digital and face-to-face socializing is not as enjoyable as putting down the phone and just spending time together. In a study at the University of Virginia, we tracked the social behavior and well-being of 174 millennials over the course of a week.
At five random times each day, we sent each person a one-minute survey to complete on their mobile phone.
We asked what they had been doing in the previous 15 minutes, including whether they were socializing in person or digitally (such as by texting or using social media). We also asked how close or distant they were feeling to other people, and how good or bad they were feeling overall.
We werent particularly surprised to find that people felt better and more connected during times when they only socialized face-to-face, as compared with when they werent socializing at all. This fit with decades of existing research. We didnt find any benefits of digital socializing over not socializing at all, though our study wasnt designed to explore that distinction.
We did find, however, that when socializing face-to-face only, people felt happier and more connected to others than when they were socializing only through their phones.
This is notable because the people in our study were the generation of so-called digital natives, who had been using smartphones, tablets and computers to interact since very young ages. Even for them, the benefits gleaned from good old face-to-face talking exceeded the well-being of digitally mediated communication.
Most critically, people felt worse and less connected when they mixed face-to-face with digital socializing, compared to when they solely socialized in person. Our results suggest that digital socializing doesnt add to, but in fact subtracts from, the psychological benefits of nondigital socializing.
Giving people a fighting chance
As peoples useful digital devices start to provide more and better options for limiting screen time and staving the flow of digital interruptions, deciding when to use those powers is neither obvious nor intuitive. Behavioral science provides some promising solutions to this predicament.
Rather than having to decide activity by activity when not to be interrupted, people could make Do Not Disturb the default, only seeing notifications when they want to.
My recent research  with Nicholas Fitz and Dan Ariely at Duke Universitys Center for Advanced Hindsight  suggests, however, that never receiving notifications hurts well-being by increasing fear of missing out.
The best way is the middle way: We found that setting the phone to deliver batches of notifications three times a day optimized well-being. To set their users up for optimal psychological benefits from both their digital and nondigital activities, Google and Apple could make batching notifications easier.
Google and Apple should also expand their proactive recommendations for managing interruptions.
The iPhone, for example, already offers the option to automatically turn on Do Not Disturb while driving, and in the forthcoming features, while sleeping. The growing evidence on how smartphones are compromising well-being during social interactions suggests that social and family time also warrants protection from digital disturbance.
People spend more time in the company of their digital gadgets than with friends and even romantic partners. It is only fair that these devices should learn more about what makes people happy, and provide a chance to reclaim the happiness lost to digital activity  and from the companies that need peoples attention to thrive. -dailymail

Krakatau volcano shrinks by two-thirds
INDONESIA: The Indonesian volcano which caused a tsunami that killed more than 400 people last week lost more than two-thirds of its height following the eruption which triggered the killer waves.
A section of Anak Krakatoas crater collapsed after an eruption and slid into the ocean, generating the tsunami last Saturday night. A visual analysis by the Indonesian volcanology agency found the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height, an official said Saturday. Anak Krakatoa which used to stand 338 metres (1,109 feet) high was now just 110 metres tall.
The agency estimated the volcano lost between 150 and 180 million cubic metres of material as massive amounts of rock and ash have been slowly sliding into the sea following a series of eruptions.
Anak Krakatoa is now much shorter, usually you can see the peak from the observatory post, now you cant, Wawan Irawan, a senior official at the agency, told AFP. Before and after satellite images taken by Japans space agency showed that a two square kilometre chunk of the volcanic island had collapsed into the water. The volcano, whose name means Child of Krakatoa, was a new island that emerged around 1928 in the crater left by Krakatoa, whose massive 1883 eruption killed at least 36,000 people.
The craters status has been raised to high alert, the second-highest warning on Indonesia four-point danger scale.
The exclusion zone has been extended from two to five kilometres (1.2 to three miles).
A week after the tsunami, thousands of Indonesian Muslims attended a mass prayer on Saturday to remember the victims and pray for the safety of their tsunami-prone hometown.
Residents of Pandeglang regency, which was hit the hardest by the disaster, gathered in the early morning, some in tears as they chanted their prayers.
I prayed for the victims and I also pray for the safety of the people who live in the tsunami affected area, Dadan Suryana, a tsunami survivor, told AFP.
My prayer is for the victims to get help and be granted patience and I also pray the government will immediately help us to rebuild, to provide clothes and food, or at least to give us moral support, fellow congregant Dian Rosdiana said. Authorities said at least 426 people were killed and 23 missing in the disaster.
Some 7,202 people suffered injuries and nearly 1,300 homes were destroyed after the waves crashed into the coastlines of western Java island and south Sumatra. More than 40,000 people have been evacuated for fear of another tsunami as Anak Krakatoa continues to rumble. Indonesia, a vast Southeast Asian archipelago, is one of the most disaster-hit nations on Earth due to its position straddling the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide. - AFP

The last intellectual
A few years ago, I attended a lecture at the Sorbonne by the President of the Irish Republic, Michael D. Higgins, about Irelands historic relations with Europe. Because it would be in English, a French translation was circulated in advance. This referred frequently to the role of les intellectuels, which made me wonder, since the honorific use of the noun intellectual was unusual in English, what the Presidents phrasing was going to be. This turned out to be public intellectuals, an awkward compound signalling the scarcity of the species in an English as distinct from French or Irish context, and the consequent anomaly of the English languages discomfort with the unadorned noun.
If the usage, and perhaps the species, is unBritish, it is evidently not unAmerican. Lionel Trilling (190575) was, in the words of Adam Kirsch, the editor of Life in Culture: Selected letters, an intellectual, a thinker about society, politics, and ideas. Trilling, too, thought himself an intellectual. On December 16, 1953, he explained the term to an enquirer from Oxford. It isnt a word that charms me, but it is, in this country at least, rather forced on one. I use it with much of the sense of intelligentsia in it. He added: Maybe we should say clercs!, again suggesting the languages inhospitality to the offending noun, even in its American variety. He elaborated impishly that intellectuals are those people whom those of my students who aspire to be intellectuals call intellectuals! When, in the preface to Beyond Culture (1965), Trilling spoke of New York intellectuals, he was remembering a TLS reviewer who had said one of his books was mostly addressed to a narrow class of New York intellectuals as judged by [my] own brighter students in Columbia. In his response, Trilling instinctively turned to the differences in intellectual temperament between educated Englishmen and educated Americans. The noun intellectual occurs frequently in the letters. It suggests a broader range of interests than critic and presupposes some public activism, though in England, and in American academic circles, Trilling is mainly known as a critic, once an admired species.
Most of Trillings career was spent at Columbia University, where he had been a student, and where he was the first Jew to be taken on as an instructor by the English Department . . . with a view to possible promotion . . . as an experiment. His first books were critical studies of Matthew Arnold (1939) and E. M. Forster (1943), and a novel, The Middle of the Journey (1947). The work that established Trillings international reputation, however, was his first collection of essays, The Liberal Imagination (1950), which is still the main defining document of his work and influence.
In 1953, answering a French schoolteacher, who asked what he meant by liberal, Trilling referred to his books on Arnold and Forster, and said his novel could be described as a natural history of the intellectual liberal class as I understand it. Although most of his subsequent books were collections of critical essays, he had published stories from the age of twenty, and had always wanted to write fiction. He chafed from the start at the boredom of inconceivable departmental meetings and the circumambient stupidity of his academic entourage. He established himself as part of the New York intellectual scene, becoming associated with the Partisan Review, a journal of the anti-Stalinist Left. His letters are addressed to literary scholars, former students (Allen Ginsberg and Norman Podhoretz, among others), assorted colleagues, editors, rabbis and psychiatrists, but also to other writers, including his wife Diana (outnumbering other correspondents), Edmund Wilson, Eric Bentley, Rebecca West, Saul Bellow, Bernard Malamud and even Jacqueline Kennedy (the message to the latter, correcting an administrative confusion, was dated twelve days before the assassination of her husband, whom Trilling had met at a brilliantly memorable White House reception for Nobel laureates the previous year).
Until the 1950s, literary critics had a status in the culture which no longer exists. One has only to think of the authority wielded by F. R. Leavis among disciples and antagonists alike, and the readiness of prestigious trade publishers to publish his writings, or those of Edmund Wilson in America, to recognize the extent of the change. Whether this is due to increasing academic specialization or other intellectual distortions of the academy, the public voice of the literary critic has become marginal. In 1972, Trilling himself reported a cultural mutation, a developing insensitivity to literature in universities, of which his letters are a barometer. Although continuing to publish critical essays to the end, he felt increasingly alienated from the critical trade and the rebarbative professionalization of graduate students, as he told John Crowe Ransom in 1948, though with undergraduates my spirits do not sink. In 1951, he told Podhoretz, then studying at Cambridge, that he understood Leaviss pedagogic rage for the first time, and that his own instinct was to declare a moratorium on literature as an academic study. He told tienne Gilson in 1955 that he accepted as the highest compliment Gilsons comment that I am not a literary critic. Yet late in life he declined to be characterized as a creative artist . . . . Best refer to me as a critic of literature. This Janus-like ambivalence is a feature of his thinking on almost every subject of importance.
I remember the impact of The Liberal Imagination, received by my undergraduate contemporaries in the 1950s as a work of literary criticism, but addressing issues of political and social concern more explicitly and more wide-rangingly than anything to be found in Leaviss analyses of literary texts, for all Leaviss affirmations of interest in a sociological approach and his efforts at educational outreach. Trillings intention in criticism was to help define the proper place of literature in life, as he wrote in 1942, a more activist conception than Leaviss of the relation of literature to life. Trilling was less given to the kind of close reading Leavis practised. He disliked the EmpsonBrooksTate style of New Criticism, in solidarity with Edmund Wilson, describing himself and Wilson in 1957 as two general American critics who are not New Critics but are not Old Critics either.
The Liberal Imagination is a quietly embattled book, stirred by the live passions of the Cold War and animated by a principled anti-Stalinism. It contains essays on novelists and poets, but also, like his later essay collections, on broader social subjects like Art and Neurosis and The Kinsey Report. Louis Menand has said that The Liberal Imagination made literary criticism matter to people who were not literary critics. It sold 170,000 copies. As well as being a relief from Leavisian dogmatism, Trillings book epitomized a difference between the English critic and the New York intellectual, whom narrowly schooled English readers like myself nevertheless read in a narrower, selective way.

Leeds downed by transfer target Bowen
LONDON, Saturday - Jarrod Bowen struck twice to give Hull a 2-0 victory over the team linked with signing him as Championship leaders Leeds Uniteds seven-match winning run was brought to an end on Saturday.
The 22-year-old -- who the Yorkshire club are reportedly willing to offer 6.5million ($8.2million) to replace homesick Spaniard Samuel Saiz -- struck once in each half to give his side their fifth win in six games.
Leeds were unable to repeat their feat of the past two matches in coming from behind to win 3-2 but remain three points clear of Norwich.
Leeds Argentinian coach Marcelo Bielsa blamed the defeat on a lack of accuracy in front of goal but was satisfied enough with the overall performance.
Until now, the team has given a positive response, said the 63-year-old former Argentina and Chile national coach.
We ran enough and we dominated the game. When you dont dominate a game, you make less effort.
The performance of the team was not particularly different from the other games we played.
Norwich had looked on course to go level on points with Bielsas side when they took a 3-2 lead over Derby through Finnish international Teemu Pikkus second of the match nine minutes from time -- but then the floodlights failed at Carrow Road.
Norwichs cohesiveness also faded when the game restarted 15 minutes later as goals from Florian Jozefzoon and Jack Marriott secured the points for Frank Lampards side in a thrilling 4-3 triumph.
Lampard pumped the air in celebration as his side halted a run of three games without a win and consolidated sixth place, four points clear of Birmingham.
It was a game which had everything and I dont think I have been involved with one like that before, said Lampard.
I think the delay worked in our favour because Norwich had just scored their goal and the momentum was with them.
It was bad timing for them and good timing for us because it gave us the chance to reorganise things.
Norwich stay in second spot, two points ahead of third-placed West Bromwich Albion who showed character to draw 1-1 with Sheffield Wednesday.
West Brom looked to be down and out when Jay Rodriguez was sent off in the 63rd minute but Chris Brunt popped up to prod the ball home in the fifth minute of time added on to share the points.
West Broms manager Darren Moore said they would probably appeal Rodriguez red card -- for stamping on Marco Matias -- as they cannot afford to have such a crucial player miss three matches.
When he came off he (Rodriguez) said: gaffer, I didnt touch him, said Moore.
I believe that. It looked a nothing incident. I would like to appeal it as it is a straight red and a three-game ban.
Aitor Karankas hold on the Nottingham Forest managers job looks even less secure after they went down 1-0 to Millwall, who moved three points clear of the bottom three.
Ryan Tunnicliffes overhead kick settled the game and extended Forests run without a win to five matches with the daunting task of facing Leeds on Tuesday to come. - AFP

Loves Many Angles
Its hard to believe, but its true. We have reached the last day of Twenty-Eighteen. When the sun rises tomorrow, we will be stepping into a brand new year, and a brand new life, hopefully with a set of brand new resolutions. For some of us, that is. For me, there would not be that many changes in the list of resolutions I made last year, and on top of the list would be one resolution I have been making for the last ten years: Finish reading the Brothers Karamazov. I confess, it is the greatest book (other than the English Patient, and the Ulysses) I have taken so long to read, with the end seemingly an eternity away.
And yet, almost everyone worth knowing, from my father to Namel Weeramuni to Einstein and Vonnegut, has praised Dostoyevskys magnum opus to the skies and beyond. Vonnegut, in Slaughterhouse -Five, wrote that there is one other book, that can teach you everything you need to know about life. Its The Brothers Karamazov, by Fyodor Dostoevsky. Einstein considered The Brothers Karamazov to be the supreme summit of all literature and said that he had learned more from Dostoevsky than any other thinker. Freud called The Brothers Karamazov the most magnificent novel ever written.
The book was also hugely inspirational to a number of other influential philosophers of the 20th century, including Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and Camus, the last of whom declared that Dostoevsky, not Marx, was the great prophet for the 20th century. Hope you now have an idea as to why my New Year resolution number one in 2019 is to finish reading the Brothers. Lots of great people recommend it.
And yet, the book is much longer than the Pataranga Jataka, which, according to Martin Wickremasinghe in Kaliyugaya is the longest tale ever told. In case you are not familiar with the text, be informed that the book is divided into parts, each part being further subdivided into about four books, and each book containing usually 810 chapters. Oh, and theres a three chapter epilogue on top of that. Add to this the sheer length of the novel (my edition is 776 pages)and it is not surprising that each year I find myself reading only a handful of pages.
The fact that the book is a translation is no help at all, when at times you find yourself wondering if Dostoevsky really wrote such and such a line or if it is something the translator came up with, to keep the flow of the narrative. History has it that it was towards the end of the nineteenth century, that it became clear to readers in Europe and America that masterpieces of fiction on a huge scale had been produced during the last half century in Russia. And yet, the craze for Dostoevsky had come later. Anna Karenina had appeared first in France and was reviewed in England by Matthew Arnold, who saw what a great novel it was, though he objected that Anna behaved in a rather precipitate and un-English fashion: George Eliot would have organized her temptation and fall as perceptively but with more decorum.
It was Constance Garnett, the wife of a literary agent and man of letters, who brought out translations of all of Dostoevskys novels between 1912 and 1920, when his work was already well known on the Continent. Her knowledge of Russian was not particularly good and she was apt to leave out the bits she could not quite get the sense of, but she adored her work and her style had a natural animation and flow. She had already translated Turgenev, and her version of Dostoevsky remained the standard one until fairly recently, though there were more accurate renderings by David Magarshak and others.
Luckily, my version of the story is by Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, both of whom, according to the New Yorker are unusually well qualified for such a task. Pevear has received fellowships for translation from several august bodies including the Guggenheim Foundation, and Larissa Volokhonsky was born in Leningrad and has wide experience of putting into English the new Russian orthodox theologians. They also have a clear idea of what the problems of Englishing Dostoevsky are: how to give some idea of the extraordinarily rich polyphony of voices, accents, undertones, and suggestions in the text; how to convey the novels marvelous construction, and at the same time its wholly living air of majestic dishevelment.
Truth be told, once you do get absorbed into the story, you feel the same kind of profound otherworldliness hours of meditation would bring you. And what is amazing is that, even if you are not into that kind of spiritual lightness the yoga gurus advertise, within the vast length of the Brothers Karamazov you will find a page or two that will always suit your mood. For example, if you have been dealing with social media for way too long, so much so that instead of human faces, you just see emoticons and you find yourself momentarily nostalgic for complete words, complete sentences you will find what you want in the speeches of Dostoevskys characters: they speak passionately, and at length, about their hopes, fears, and passions. Reading the novel is like entering into the most fascinating, absorbing, juicy conversation you have ever had.
At the same time, if you wish to get away from trashy television shows (Hindi tele-dramas or Keeping up with the Kardishans) and you feel as though you are falling into an abyss of shallow art, there is plenty of hope that the Brothers Karamazov would keep you from falling right in.
Even though I have yet to finish reading the book, it is clear from what I have read so far this last story the great Russian novelist ever wrote, encompassing all the energy and passion of a mans last words is one of the best novels ever written in any language. It is amazing how, through the murder of perhaps one of the most despicable characters ever created, Fyodor Karamazov, the father of the Karamazov brothers, Dostoevsky focuses on the Really Big Questions in our lives. Do we have free will Why do human beings have to suffer Are there limits to human reason Are we bound by moral laws How do we achieve happiness Chances are you will find the answers within the pages as well as many beautiful quotes: Love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared to love in dreams, and I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why are two of my favorites.
It was in my teens that I first heard of The Brothers Karamazov from my father and in recent years from Namel Weeramuni  I owe them both for introducing me to this life changing book, though difficult to read the first time. And I believe in passing on the good word. If you havent read it yet, heres hoping you will do so, next year.

The Ministry has already taken a number of measures to prevent the spreading of Sena. Accordingly, the Ministry has introduced four insecticides and appointed a Task Force to work on this. The government has already granted a 50 percent subsidy for those insecticides.
Minister Harrison also instructed the Secretary to seek the advice of Agriculture Department officials, environmentalists and experts to prevent this menace which has already been reported from three districts, from speading.
The Ministry has also taken measures to make farmers aware about this invasive pest and also instructed them to be vigilant on the presence of these caterpillars in their crops.
Ministry sources said the female caterpillars lay eggs and multiply very rapidly.
The presence of the invasive trans-boundary pest which was discovered for the first time in Nigeria has already spread across Asia.
This invasive pest was detected in India three months ago.
Sena is regarded as a highly invasive species due to its ability to spread and reproduce quickly. A female cetepiller can lay over 1000 eggs during its lifespan. The larvae stage is responsible for damaging the crop and the adult moths get carried away by the wind.

Monsieur Bb: The Brief, Strange Life of Raymond Radiguet
In the spring of 1923, the young married artists Jean and Valentine Hugo began inviting people to sances at their Paris apartment. A new mood of occultism, influenced by Freud and the early Surrealists, was in the air. And raising the dead was in Jeans blood: while his great-grandfather, Victor Hugo, was in exile in the 1850s, he presided over frequent table-rapping sessions on the Channel Islands. As Victor Hugo recorded in four red notebooks, his talking table conducted conversations with such eager spirits as Jesus, Moses, Dante, and Shakespearethe last of whom, obligingly, concurred with Hugos assessment of himself as the greatest writer of all time. Jean and Valentines gatherings, however, elicited messages so chilling that the group, spooked, abandoned the practice after only a few tries. It wasnt an overreaction; before the years end, the omens theyd received in their sances were borne out.
In a pink velvet-lined anteroom, the Hugos and their friends, including the artistic polymath Jean Cocteau and the avant-garde composer Georges Auric, encircled a wooden pedestal with a tripod base and tilting round top, a type of table reputed to encourage spiritual communion. Placing their hands on its surface, which was lacquered black and painted with flowers, they asked questions. The table tapped out answers on the floor (one tap meaning the letter a, and so on), which Jean Hugo wrote down. Over the course of these sittings, the clearest messages were intended for the youngest guest: the nineteen-year-old Raymond Radiguet, Cocteaus protg and lover, who had just published his scandalous debut novel, Le Diable au corps (The Devil in the Flesh). Uneasiness will grow with genius, claimed the spirit. Radiguet, the spirit said, should love me for he loves nothing. It warned: Fame does not replace love even in death and I am death. The following week came deaths final declaration: I want his youth.
Radiguets publisher, Bernard Grasset, had also wanted the writers youth. Eighteen months earlier, Cocteau had taken his young friend to Grassets office in the rue des Saints-Pres. (ditions Grasset still occupies the same building, number 61.) Radiguet sat silently as Cocteau read aloud from the manuscript of his novel. Grasset, then a forty-year-old seasoned editor, thought Radiguet looked like a schoolboy at his first interview with the headmaster. Among other career triumphs, Grasset had published the first volume of Prousts  la recherche du temps perdu after a competitor rejected it. He genuinely admired Le Diable au corps, but he prized the boys precociousness as much as his talent, at least when it came to publicity. While Radiguet revised his novel and rewrote the ending, Grasset paid him a monthly salary of fifteen hundred francs (the equivalent of over three thousand dollars today) and planned the most aggressive book-marketing campaign France had ever seen.
Posters, flyers, and bookstore displayseven cinema newsreels of Radiguet signing his contract and accepting an advance check for a hundred thousand francsall emphasized the astounding youth of this new literary sensation. The media responded with exasperation at such blatant and unseemly hype. I dont care whether the author is seventeen or a hundred and seven, wrote one reviewer. It is the book we have to judge, not the birth certificate. But the tactics worked. In its first month, Le Diable au corps sold forty-six thousand copies, ushering in a new era where the no such thing as bad publicity axiom applied even to the rarefied endeavour of literature. In the words of Cocteau:
Before Radiguet, publicity was a very discreet affair, with the author pretending to be totally unaware of it. Radiguet was the first author courageous enough to take a long chance by launching a campaign that might have alienated immediate buyers, but thanks to which, within two weeks his book was in the hands of buyers who formerly might not have known about it for years.
Judged on merit rather than manufactured hoopla, Radiguets daring plot and spare, controlled prose only served to magnify the shock value of his age. He had written, argued an impressed critic, the most immoral novel since Les Liaisons dangereuses. The gay poet and painter Max Jacob, one of Radiguets friends, told him he hoped his second novel would be less cruel and more chaste. But the novelist Franois Mauriac, who reviewed Le Diable au corps on the front page of Les Nouvelles littraires, saw no point in fulminating against the tales transgressive nature. Instead he praised Radiguets restrained and original technique, which seemed to him, remarkably, to betray no literary influences whatsoever.
I am sure to incur a good deal of reproach, goes the dynamite first line of the book. But what I am to do The unnamed narrator, looking back on his years as a clever, stealthily rebellious adolescent, recounts an illicit wartime romance with Marthe, a local girl a few years his senior.
With Marthes soldier husband off fighting in the trenches, she succumbs to a passionate affair with the boy, who is only sixteen but, in Radiguets finely shaded and convincing portrayal, years ahead of her in guile. After their first kiss, Marthe weeps and tries to send him away, saying she is too old for him. For our fledgling sadist hero, this marks a pinnacle of joy. Nothing, he reflects, could be quite like the delightful feeling at seeing a nineteen-year-old girl cry because she thinks shes too old.
When Marthe gets pregnant, the narrators childish amazement that his actions might have consequences mingle with pride, horror, and resentment at the prospect of pleasure curtailed. I wanted to have as much as I could of Marthe before motherhood spoiled her. Later, he berates himself for sullying a cherished possession. When I thought how I had spoiled Marthes graceful beauty and how her belly was swelling, I regarded myself as nothing better than a vandal. Worse is yet to come. Caught in the freezing rain one night in Paris, after her nervous lover balked at getting them the hotel hed promised, Marthe catches a bad cold. She dies soon after giving birth.
The narrators reaction epitomizes the novels singular style: aphoristic and brazen, at once astute and artless.

The Mayor was addressing the monthly meeting of the Nuwara Eliya Municipal Council (MC) held on December 28. He said a multi-ethnic community lives in Nuwara Eliya and communal and religious harmony in the area should be ensured.
The Mayor said he had directed the MC Commissioner to check the litigants credentials to this land.
Karunaratne said he is not a wealthy person.
He said that if he lost the case, he would sell a property he owns to pay the compensation that the court orders him to pay because he valued respect of the Hindu Community in Nuwara Eliya more than his land and other properties.

Peoples power helped defeat pseudo Govt. - Ravi
The UNP could not provide benefits to its party supporters because it practised Yahapalana ideals within the party unlike other sections which engaged in politics.
October 26 created a black scar for democracy in the country. But the peoples power enabled them to restore the Ranil Wickremesinghe government in power defeating the pseudo government.
We hope to make use of this opportunity to bring about massive development hitherto unprecedented in the country Power and Renewable Energy and Enterprise Development Minister Ravi Karunanayake said.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held at Summitpura grounds, Mattakuliya on December 28.
Minister Karunanayake who pointed out that the rupee had rapidly depreciated added that it should not be allowed to depreciate since a strong government was back in power.
We consider it our prime duty to bring down the cost of living for the benefit of the common masses, he said.
Karunanayake said material and human development should go hand in hand in developing the country. The future generation was the countrys most valuable asset and it should be nurtured in the education and mental spheres.
The minister distributed a stock of exercise books and educational equipment among a group of 1,000 students belonging to low income families.

## Title: Reading Pathways: Eva Ibbotson

Reading Pathways: Eva Ibbotson
Eva Ibbotson is one of those authors whose style is so distinct that I could never mistake a piece of her writing for anyone elses work. Whether reading one of her charming, curious childrens stories or one of her music box-esque romances, Ibbotsons voice is wholly unique. Though she was 50 before she published her first book, in her 35-year career Ibbotson wrote some 17 childrens books, as well as six romances and a collection of short stories.
Ibbotson, who sadly passed away in 2010, was born in Vienna in 1925. When she was 8, she and her father left Vienna for Scotland when the Nazi party came to power, but its clear that her early years in Vienna had a profound effect on Ibbotsons imagination. Vienna, and the breathtaking beauty of the Austrian countryside, feature prominently in many of her novels. In particular her romances, three of which take place at least in part in Vienna, with a fourth set in the country.
Despite the adoration of those who have had the good luck to come across her work, Ibbotson doesnt get much word of mouth these days. So Ive made it my mission to introduce her to as many new readers as I possibly can. Right now many of her novels are still available either in print or ebook form, but I would hate to see a day where theyve been forgotten completely and left to go out of print.
Along with The Secret of Platform 13, Which Witch is one of Ibbotsons better known childrens books. Its also the perfect example of the whimsical yet delightfully dark style she used for her younger readers. Which Witch tells the story of Arriman the Awful, a handsome wizard who decides to hold a contest to choose his wife. His wife must be the darkest, wickedest enchantress in all the landand unfortunately for Belladonna, thats exactly what she is not. No matter how hard she tries, her magic keeps coming out light and good, and that will never win her Arrimans hand. Whats a witch to do
Which Witch is the sort of book that, though written for children, will enchant adults as well. Its witty, fantastical, and just the right amount of macabre in the way that all the best childrens books should be. If you like it make sure to check out Ibbotsons other childrens books, like The Star of Kazan!
This was my first ever Ibbotson book. I started with her romances (originally published for adults, then repackaged for young adults in the early 2000s), and then graduated backwards to her childrens books. If youre a fan of YA romance, adult romance novels, or both, you definitely need to give Ibbotsons romances a chance. Theyre lyrical and dreamy, like a fairy tale. She has a meandering style that you just have to go with, because you never know what lovely little tidbit shes going to reveal. A Countess Below Stairs is the story of Anna, a young Russian aristocrat whose family fled the revolution and came to Britain. Robbed along the way, they were left penniless and Anna finds herself a job in the house of Rupert, Earl of Westerholme. Also known as the sweetest, gentlest, most honorable of men. The beta romance hero of your dreams.
Ive been reading romance novels since I was 11 years old, but Ibbostons remain some of the most romantic Ive ever read. If you enjoy A Countess Below Stairs, make sure to check out her other romances. I particularly recommend A Company of Swans, which is about a young ballet dancer, and is a gorgeous book with a very smoldery hero. As well as The Morning Gift, which is about a young Jewish woman and the handsome professor who marries her so that he can smuggle her out of Vienna when Hitlers forces invade.
If neither Which Witch nor A Countess Below Stairs catches your fancyor if youre intrigued but not yet ready to commit to one of Ibbotsons longer booksI highly recommend her collection of short stories. Containing 18 stories in total, A Glove Shop in Vienna and Other Stories is probably the best way to get acquainted with Ibbotsons quality of storytelling. Though more in the vein of her romances than her macabre childrens stories, this collection presents a fabulous range of settings and stories.

Respect every life
To celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International day for Human Rights, the French Embassy, the French Agency for Development (AFD), Medecins du Monde (MDM) and Alliance Francaise de Kotte organized the press conference - Sexual and Reproductive Health For All.
Medecins du Monde as implemented in Sri Lanka in 2016 as a 30 month project, co -financed by AFD, aimed at improving access to qualitative SRH services and advocating for the integration of the plantation healthy sector within the public health system.
70 years ago, the General Assembly of the UN adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stating that all women and men must enjoy free and equal rights. Kofi Anan said  These rights do not belong to any government and they are not limited to any continent, because they are inherent to humanity itself.
Ambassador of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Eric Lavertu commented it is a matter of pride for him to be able to be present at this event that is convened to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and stated that this event further strengthens the ties between Sri Lanka and France.
Alliance Francaise is a symbol of the bond between Sri Lanka and France and our shared values. This Universal Declaration of Human Rights affirms that all humans enjoy the same rights and it is not limited to caste, gender or religion. This protects and respects all human beings. This event wishes to highlight the efforts taken by Medecins De Monde, an NGO that has taken vital steps to promote human rights in Sri Lanka. This project aims at addressing a fundamental aspect of Human Rights which is the Sexual and Reproductive Health for all. France respects Human Rights and regards it as a feature of a developed and civilized society. This event tries to spread the message of the importance of respecting a human beings body and the importance of fighting sexual discrimination, said Lavertu.
Lavertu stressed that we must remember that Human Rights must be respected and any violation of human rights is unpardonable. This should be a powerful reminder to the international community. Lavertu pointed out, that for this, spreading awareness is important, and the goal of the press conference is that generation after generation will never forget.
French Agency for Development in Sri Lanka, Country Director, Martin Parent stated that gender inequality and gender based violence must be addressed and the message that it is not acceptable needs to be carried to every section of society.
We must not be pessimistic and forever be vigilant when it comes to protecting womens rights. We need to focus on solutions. Communities need to take control of their future. And this is the future they wish for their children. We must be grateful for Medecins De Monde for the work they are doing in Sri Lanka, fighting for the rights of all human beings. This project is without doubt very important, said Parent
Medecins du Monde, Country Representative, Pauline Heritier Laffargue pointed out that the response Medecins De Monde has received so far is very encouraging. Such an event like this press conference is very motivating and helps a lot in the completion of their work.
This project aims at improving the quality of Sexual and Reproductive Health services and also addresses the issue of gender based violence in the estate regions. Also the issue of sexually transmitted infections is also discussed. We have faced challenges and difficulties but we are going on bravely. We wish to see positive outcomes for all our efforts. We would also like to involve men in our efforts because their participation is also important. There needs to be a discourse and these subjects must not be treated as taboo. There is still hope and we are going to break all barriers, said Laffargue.
Medecins du Monde, Sri Lanka Mission, Medical Coordinator, Dr. Norie Omamalin said that at first the start was slow and at the beginning there was hesitation. She also pointed out that these subjects are also very sensitive and that talking about it at first was difficult.
It took a lot of time for the people to trust us. The implementation was somewhat delayed because of this. So it took a lot of time getting them to talk. The people we worked with initially were very cautious and very hesitant. Getting mens engagement in the project was also challenging in the beginning. Since the men were also away in the plantations working, accessing them was a problem because we conducted our research in the day time. So we strategized when it came to getting mens engagement because that is the crucial determining factor  getting mens engagement and getting through to the boys, said Omamalin.
The general attitude at the press conference was that alcoholism and drugs are other problems and violation against women can be linked to them.
Poverty is also a problem. Because of the conditions such as lack of space in the house where people need to share rooms and no accessibility to water and electricity, all this contributes to the problem. It creates tension and we are trying to tackle this issue in the communities. This project is very gender sensitive and we must not neglect the men and the boys. We have now understood the need to get men and boys aboard with us, said Omamalin.
The statistics revealed at Alliance Francaise de Kotte recently are shocking and mortifying.
In 2012 teenage pregnancy in Sri Lanka hit 384,000 (According to the Family Health Bureau)
Every quarter 50 or more new cases of HIV are detected (According to the National STI/AIDS control program 2016  2017)
Every 90 minutes a woman is raped in Sri Lanka
Everyday 3-5 children are raped in Sri Lanka (According to UN Survey on Violence Against women 2013)
Only about 50 percent of both in School and Out of school adolescents are aware about STIs and HIV/AIDS ( According to the National Survey on emerging issues in Sri Lanka 2014)
There are an estimated 650 abortions performed daily in Sri Lanka (Family Health Bureau 2016)
Sexual Abuse and Harassment is on the rise. Sri Lanka has the highest rate of sexual harassment in South Asia. (According to Legal Aid Commission 2011)

Romantic Arches
Wrapping up our series on hard landscaping, we study the role arches and pottery play in home gardens. We must not ignore the value of the arch and the elegance of pottery in the home garden. Green Thumbs speaks to Deputy Provincial Director of Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor K. N. K. Jayathilake on the instantaneous effect arches and pottery has on a visitor.
An arch welcomes the visitor into the Garden. Imagine walking through an Arch adorned with splendid colourful and fragrant flowers in clusters, almost like a crown. You feel welcome and even before you enter the garden you feel exuberant and you feel so positive. You feel an energy because the arch is alive! The flowers are alive! There is that naturalness because you feel refreshed, you feel welcomed by something alive! That is the power of an arch. It gives one the feeling that he or she is valued and wanted. There may be many arches in addition to the one that greets you before you enter the garden.
An Arch welcomes the person into your home. It is the portal not only to your home but to your heart as well. However it needs to be in proportion to the pathways. The height and width of the Arch is important. The Arch can be rounded or square. They can be concrete arches, iron or wooden, said Jayathilake.
We know that nighttime has a certain effect on the garden that is not there in the day time. The moonlight falling on the Arch covered in blossoms is just magical. If you plan on having a couple of arches in your garden, these creepers with their flowers will make the garden look stunning - making it look like gemstones on a crown fit for a king. Bathed in moonlight, it looks like Cinderellas ball.
Creepers with flowers look very beautiful on the Arch. The creepers must be carefully selected as the colours of the flowers need to be in sync with the surroundings. They need to be perennial creepers lasting for more than two years. The flowers should blossom for a long period of time, stated Jayathilake.
The creepers can also be vegetable creepers. Here they serve a dual purpose. They add to the beauty of the surroundings and also provide food for the household. It too has an effect on the guest entering the garden because it is pleasing to the eye and appealing to the palate. Here we can use three or four flower and vegetable creepers as different varieties reach maturity at different stages.
Here pruning these creepers is very important. Maintenance is important and we need to use good fertilizer. Some examples for vegetable creepers are Snake Gourd, Bitter Gourd and Spinach. The Arches can have different patterns making them even more attractive with the blossoms, said Jayathilake.
Pottery in the Garden is another feature of elegance and refinement. Pottery is one of the oldest human inventions, originating before the Neolithic period and has been used in gardens in many societies. The pottery is decorated in many ways, and painting itself has been used since early prehistoric times. The potters wheel was invented in Mesopotamia sometime between 6,000 and 4,000 BC.
Ancient Egyptian Art was depicted in their pottery such as the Eye of Horus Ceramic Vase Gold and Blue. Art and spirituality were deeply entwined in ancient Egypt and is depicted in their pottery.
Of course when it comes to pots in your garden some pots are there for attractiveness with various designs on them (as mentioned above) while other pots in the garden are there to grow flowers and vegetables.
Garden Pots enhance the beauty of the Home Garden. Pots can come in different shapes and placing it in the right place in the home garden is important. Its height and width needs to be suitable to the place it is placed in. These pots can be made in clay and concrete. Some pots are used as empty pots (for the appearance) and some are used for growing plants. When it comes to growing flowers, fruits and vegetables these can be done in pots. Fruits would be Orange, Lime and Cherry, while Capsicum, Brinjals and Cabbage can be used as vegetables, added Jayathilake.
According to reliable sources there are an amazing selection of garden pots available these days. Everything from classical terracotta, through to modern glazed urns in different shapes, sizes and colors. These pots placed in places of sunshine and shade contribute to the attractiveness of the garden with their various designs. They can add that level of sophistication to the garden. In the night time why not place the pots near a lantern or near an archway or perhaps along a pathway. The effect is very enchanting and more so if there are patterns on the pots which conveys that feeling of ghostliness! Pots can really do wonders for your garden.
We know that rain and passing of time can diminish the appearance of your pots. Terracotta pots are durable, inexpensive and available in a range of sizes. Painting turns plain pots into eye-catching containers, add colour to your home and garden. Very well maintained pots with flower plants with vibrant colours make your garden a pleasure to be in, said Jayathilake.
Outdoor furniture can also be placed near an archway. What a pleasure to sit down and read a book under an archway with beautiful flowers The fragrance of the flowers permeating the air! The blossoms adding a soothing effect, sometimes falling to the ground creating a very beautiful scene.
Arches are especially important for weddings with the bride and bridegroom exchanging their wedding vows under the arch if the wedding is in a house or private residence. The special day is even more special because of the flowers that represent the beauty of the occasion. Indeed it would be correct to say that these arches can melt hearts.

## Title: School fears project for its social ills

Point Pedro Fisheries Harbour
School fears project for its social ills
Point Pedro, the northernmost town in Sri Lanka, is not a big place. One hour on a bicycle is sufficient to cover almost all parts of it. So any change, big or small, has an impact. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)funded Point Pedro Fisheries Harbour will thus have a tremendous impact on this small town, forever transforming it for better or worse. But for now, there is one stakeholder it has failed to convince  the Methodist Girls School, a mere 15m away from the project.
An imposing building facing the Indian Ocean, thousands of girls for 195 years have trodden the beaches of Point Pedro to get to Methodist Girls School. It kept its doors open during the war and tsunami and has been a high security zone for many years, but now it faces the question of whether it can run next to the biggest fisheries harbour in the region. Students parents especially have voiced strong concerns against the project being directly in front of the school, and they have asked that the school principal request that the harbour be moved a few metres from the school.
Close to 1,234 students attend Methodist Girls School and when the parents first got to know of the project, over 100 parents had signed a petition against the project being located directly in front of the school.
A harbour comes with all sorts of social ills from drugs to all sorts of men. Our girls go to this school. It will misguide our children and is an affront to our culture, said Karthalingam Annamalai (56) whose daughter studies in Grade 10 at the school. Annamalai too is a fisherman by profession and whilst he recognised the benefit the harbour could bring to the region, he has been vociferous in his opposition to it being so close to the school.
Parents have pointed out that the harbour which would take five years to complete would bring the noise of construction and pollution and also be a security threat to the girls having to travel to and from school. Further, once it is built, the noise, security and smell from the fishing activities would continue to make it difficult for the children to study.
We do not want the government to lose this ADB project. We need development, we are not against it. All we are saying is, do not build it at the cost of the school, said S. Sivanesan (51), whose daughter studies in Grade 9 at the school and who is also Secretary of the School Development Committee.
A teacher from the school speaking anonymously said they were first informed of the project by the Fisheries Ministry in November 2017.
They showed us an animation of the project and said it would be one of the biggest in Sri Lanka. And since it is ADB funded, they had to start the project this year or they would lose the low-interest loan, she said.
For five years, our children will have to bear with the noise and construction. The A/L classes especially would be affected. Also, how can we run a school so close to the harbour she asked.
A parent in the meantime pointed out that they should have designed the project having first consulted with all stakeholders and not after. Now that the officials have designed it, they dont want to change it.
ADB Sri Lanka Unit Head of Portfolio Management, Manjula Amerasinghe refuted claims of there being a deadline for the loan and said (via an email query), This project is currently under processing and is not yet approved by the ADB Board. The government and ADB are working with all stakeholders (including the Methodist School) to address their concerns in the finalisation of the project design.
The project
Point Pedro consists of 14,057 families in 35 Grama Niladhari divisions out of which 2,900 families are fisher families, organised into 16 cooperative societies and one federation. For over 30 years of war, the fisheries industry in the area stood at a standstill and today revival seems like an uphill task with the rest of the world and country having moved on to bigger boats and better technology.
In the 1980s, the Northern Province contributed to 40 percent of the catch; after the war it stood at four percent. We have managed to increase it to 17 percent in the last few years, but this is the maximum we can go with the current facilities, said Prabath Ranaweera, the Project Officer assigned by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry for the modernisation of the old Point Pedro Fisheries Harbour.
Ranaweera who has been an active proponent of the project explained that the governments intension was to motivate more fishermen to get into deep sea fishing in the area as fish catches in the coastal belt were expected to dramatically fall in the next 10 years. This harbour will be able to accommodate 150 27ft boats. The South has 20 fisheries harbours; the North also needs them if they are to develop the fishing industry. At present, they cant dock a large multi-day boat even if they get one.
According to the Initial Environmental Examination (IEE) Report performed in July 2018 for the project, the new harbour is set to be an all-weather fisheries harbour consisting of two breakwater structures (880m and 425m), a 18.4 ha harbour basin, two jetties (120m and 115m), 6.4 ha area of reclaimed land (the inshore intertidal reef complex will be reclaimed), two quay walls for parking of boats and slip way able to handle vessels up to 75m. Apart from the harbour construction, the area will also have a net mending hall, community hall and canteen, bachelor quarters, harbour manager quarters, surveillance building, auction hall, parking areas, public toilets, wastewater treatment facility, security facilities, weigh bridge and control room, fuel facility, off-loading building, transformer and generator facilities.
A massive undertaking, Ranaweera explained that they had done a feasibility studies prior to the designing of the project and identified that the main social impacts were likely to be caused to two important set of stakeholders: 13 fisher families on one side and three schools on the other side; Methodist Girls High School located 15m away, Hartley Boys College located 100m away and the Point Pedro Sithivinayagar Vidyalayam located 275m. Thus the worst affected would be the Girls School. We try to avoid issues, but when that is not possible, the only possible solution is to try and minimise it, he said.
Ranaweera insisted that the project was sensitive to all the issues raised by the school which according to him were noise, smell, traffic and the obstruction of the sea view, So we proposed that no building be built in the immediate vicinity of the school, to leave a green eco belt in front of the school and allow them to use it to teach students about fisheries, to locate the auction hall which will create the noise and smell, 200m away from the school and finally, to require that all vehicles be parked within the harbour to avoid traffic congestion outside.
In a bid to convince the community of the project, the Ministry also arranged a tour of the Beruwela, Galle and Dikkowita fisheries harbours for 34 members including members of the Point Pedro Urban Council, parents from the schools, staff of the Hartley Boys College, and members of the fisheries cooperative society. They think this is a traditional harbour which is dirty and smelly. In Dikkowita too there are girls schools near the harbour and they dont have any issues. We wanted them to see what a modern harbour looked like. But the Methodist Girls School principal refused to come on the trip.
The schools close to the Dikkowita harbour however are located 110m200m away unlike the Methodist Girls School and given that difference, a parent at the school said they saw no point in the comparison or the tour of the harbour and its vicinity.
The government has also offered the school the land in front of the school to take up and manage to assure them that the space would be left empty. We are prepared to sign a MoU between the Fisheries Cooperation and the school and we will give them this land. A harbour also brings with it Customs and other security which will cut back on the illegal smuggling in the area, making it safe for the girls. In addition, the breakwater will protect it from tsunamis. I dont understand why they are against it.
Government officials who designed the project perceive the objections from the Methodist Girls School as being unfair, especially having, in their view, gone out of their way to accommodate their demands. But the school feels that the issue could be easily resolved if the officials had simply listened to them prior to finalising its design.
When asked if Ranaweera and his team considered the suggestions put forward by the parents and school to redesign some sections related to them or even to downsize it a bit, he said, If we changed it, it wont be as economical. We build these things to last another 20 years and growth in the fisheries industry also has to be taken into account.
Another official working on the project who wished to remain anonymous insisted, We are doing all these adjustments for the school. And since they dont believe us and have asked for a guarantee over the land immediately in front of the school, we asked them to take it over. We are prepared to keep 3,000sq metres of valuable land free for them.
He explained that they had met the school authorities five times, including with the Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran and Provincial education authorities. The project, he said, has also offered to build a parapet wall for the school in order to satisfy them. We have now agreed to give them a net wall, in order to not block their view of the sea.
Overall, however, the officials have taken the view that it was now time the school compromised as the project would be going ahead anyway.
Grievance committee
But the issues could have been resolved if stakeholder consultations were conducted in a transparent and open manner. The IEE in its report had proposed to set up a Grievance Committee at the Vadamarachchi North Divisional Secretariat to be able to better listen to the community. The school, it is learnt, has not been invited to any of its meetings, since it was set up in October 2018. A local government official revealed that in the meeting in November, nine fisher families who were to lose their lands to the project raised their concerns and were duly compensated for the land.
In the meantime, pressure from the Provincial Education Ministry has been building against the principal and teachers who support the parents opposing the project.
In early December, Dr Muttukrishna Sarvananthan, a resident of Point Pedro, had written a letter to the Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission asking that they intervene against the harbour being built directly before the school and also to stop the premature transfer of the Methodist Girls School principal. He alleged that given the Principals support towards the parents objections, the Northern Provincial Council Chief Secretary Pathinathan and the Provincial Education Ministry Secretary were planning to prematurely transfer the principal out of the school.
S. Sathiyaseelan, speaking to the Daily News, however assured that they were no such moves to transfer the principal. At a meeting held between all stakeholders including the ADB, Fisheries Ministry, the school and the fishing community on December 15, Sathiyaseelan said a committee had been appointed to come up with suggestions for the Fisheries Ministry on how to move forward. We are fine with the school taking over the land in front of them and utilising it. This is not a big problem  this harbour is something that the community really needs. We have to implement this anyway, he said.
How vibrant is the Northern fishing community
For Annamalai, his fight for the school is about not being able to see a future for himself in the fishing industry. Despite government schemes promising to help fishermen in the area upgrade their boats, he said the banks asked for heavy collateral before granting any loans.
Only outsiders with money will benefit from the new harbour. They will bring their boats and coolers and take the fish and leave. We would only have to sell diesel and ice to them, he remarked.
Poaching of fish by Indian trawlers and fishermen from other areas has further depleted their stocks, he added. In a few years, fish stocks will be depleted. It is then that we would need the schools for our children.
Kanthavanam Suriyakumaran, a member of the Fishermens Cooperative Society in the area, has two of his daughters attending Methodists Girls School, but he was of the view that the school needed to compromise for his profession to progress. The school does not understand what this fisheries harbour can do for us here. We need multi-day boats to be profitable, but today even if I were to buy a larger boat, I have no place to dock it.
He was also of the opinion that the school which had many parents involved in the government services or white collar jobs were blind to the needs of the fishing community.
Vadamarachchi East Fishermens Cooperative Secretary S. Natkunam too echoed Suriyakumarans views and insisted that they would not be able to survive without a modern fisheries harbour in the future. We know that the school should not be impacted either. Our children go there, but having seen the other harbours, it should not be an issue.
A compromise
The World Bank has found that public participation in an Environmental Impact Assessment tended to improve project design, environmental soundness and social acceptability, but more often than not, the manner in which it is done can spell more trouble or a smooth transition for a project. On December 15, when all stakeholders were brought to the table, tensions were running high, despite all parties agreeing that a fisheries harbour at Point Pedro was a positive development; lack of transparency, miscommunication, intimidation and closed door meetings had made the group split into two camps.
According to a parent who attended the meeting, a committee comprising all stakeholders came together to discuss two possible options. One option was to take ownership of the land in front of the school as proposed by the authorities, and the second was to ask the authorities to expand the land area into the north (towards the sea), instead of coming towards the school. The second option had been rejected by the authorities for some time as it would require redesign, but the technical officers who attended the meeting on December 15, informed them that this could be done, said the parent.
The School Development Committee thereafter met again on December 17 and they are expected to advocate the second option.
We could have solved this matter long time ago, only if government officials actually listened to us, he said.
It however remains to be seen whether the government and the ADB would eventually take steps to save the school at the tip of this island nation.

Housing Construction and Cultural Affairs Minister Sajith Premadasa has commended the public for remaining calm and acting in an exemplary manner in the face of the organised vandalism caused to certain places of Buddhist worship in Mawanella by some disruptive elements.
The Minister in a statement issued on December 28 said Buddha statues erected at Randiwela junction, Miriskudu junction, Pahala Kadugannawa and Indula junction had been destroyed by this group of vandals and he has deployed a team of officers from the Cultural Affairs and Archaeology Department to investigate the damage so that the statues could be restored within a week, as the necessary funds had been estimated for allocations towards the job.
He said the team of officials included Kegalle Archaeology assistant Director H.B.A.K. Nilmalgoda, Mrs. E.M.R.K. Menike, T.K.M.K. Dissanayake, Mrs. Niluka Dharmadasa and National Heritage Deputy Director Prasad Ranasignhe.

The year 2018 will be remembered by many for re-defining cinema and movie watching experience of the viewers. Probably for the first time in the last few decades the focus of the filmmaking has been shifted to content rather than making star vehicles. Another interesting thing about the year is that great movies have been made across genres. From Hollywoods musicals like A Star is Born and Bohemian Rhapsody to animated movies like Incredibles 2 and Marvel productions like Black Panther and Venom and Bollywood big budget magnum opuses like Padmaavat to comedes like Badhaai Ho, biopics like Manto, and an intimate slice of life like October, we got a mix bag of stories put through the lens of cinema this year as well. As the year comes to an end, we take a trip back to the glorious year that 2018 was.

The year that was
October 26, 2018 dawned just like any other day. People went about their normal business. But as the evening approached, rumours began circulating that former President and MP Mahinda Rajapaksa has been appointed as the Prime Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena. Everyone was naturally baffled  there was no election or budget vote. Was there any other provision or loophole in the Constitution that could make this happen That was the question on everyones lips. All the rumours were confirmed when Rupavahini interrupted their evening news bulletin to announce that Rajapaksa has indeed been appointed as the PM after the sacking of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Thus began 51 days of controversy, uncertainty, instability, chaos and political theatrics unprecedented in the history of Sri Lanka, even surpassing the abortive military coup of 1962. Sri Lanka, which was not in the news at all globally, was suddenly thrust into the global spotlight. Wickremesinghe, who claimed that he was ousted illegally, violating the Constitution, did not vacate Temple Trees while Rajapaksa occupied the Prime Ministers office. For all intents and purposes, Sri Lanka had two Prime Ministers, a situation which most other countries found rather baffling and even hilarious. No country recognized the new Prime Minister and the Government, though one ambassador met Rajapaksa.
There was a frantic attempt to get MPs over to the Rajapaksa camp and MP Palitha Range Bandara released the now-infamous recording of a telephone conversation where a former minister offered him various inducements for crossing over. However, Parliament had in the meantime passed several confidence votes in Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. When it became clear that the Rajapaksa camp could not muster the required numbers, Parliament was dissolved. This was immediately challenged in Courts. Although it was not very clear at the time, this was the key that resolved the whole imbroglio.
On December 7, 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the dissolution violated the Constitution. This left no option other than to recognize Ranil Wickremesinghe as the legitimate Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, ending 51 days of political turbulence that left the country in tatters. He was sworn in again on December 16, ending the Constitutional crisis and in the process, becoming the only person to have taken oaths five times as the Prime Minister. It also resulted in the formation of an all-UNF Government with the scrapping of the National Unity Government formed in 2015. Now the challenge is to keep the number of Cabinet portfolios to around 30.
Economists and political analysts are still calculating the damage suffered by the country as a result of the crisis, but it has been tentatively estimated at over Rs.220 billion inclusive of losses to the tourism sector. In fact, just two days before the illegal appointment of Rajapaksa, the respected travel publishing group Lonely Planet had named Sri Lanka as the Number One Destination for 2019. But after the unfortunate events of October 26, a large number of tourists cancelled their trips. Now that the status quo has been restored, things are returning to normal and several new airlines are flying into Colombo.
Indeed, other news stories of 2018 faded into insignificance compared to this but there were a few notable ones. In February, the local elections brought victory for the newly formed Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna or Pohottuwa Party led de facto Mahinda Rajapaksa, which was a wake-up call for both the UNP and SLFP/UPFA.
May saw the departure from our midst of the greatest Sri Lankan film director of all time Dr. Lester James Peries (99), acclaimed for changing the course of Sinhala cinema with his landmark creation Rekhawa (Line of Destiny) in 1956. Another significant event in May was the launch of a new map of Sri Lanka updated with the Colombo Port City, which will be completed by 2040.
In July, President Sirisena announced that he was in favour of reinstating the death penalty for convicted drug traffickers who were still dealing in crime from their prison cells. This raised a hornets nest as many international organisations called on the Government to rescind the decision. However, at a UN session held this month, Sri Lanka voted in favour of a moratorium on the death penalty. In this light, it seems unlikely that Sri Lanka will resume executions soon.
There were a few dark spots too as fake news and rumours resulted in ethnic riots in Ampara, Digana and Ginthota. The Government managed to quell these rather quickly. However, several recent incidents in Mawanella and elsewhere indicate that some organised groups could be trying to incite racial violence again to gain political mileage. Racism is the only oxygen they can thrive on and the Government must cut off that supply. These incidents must be nipped in the bud. During its earlier incarnation as the National Unity Government, most figures associated with this Government campaigned on a platform of peace and reconciliation. They must not lose sight of this avowed goal. Our main resolution for 2019 should be building a Sri Lankan nation that has unity at its core.
