'Justifiable increase of MP allowance reasonable'
We are against a 'thundering' increase of MPs' allowances but it is reasonable to increase them by a justifiable amount to match with the salary increase given to public servants, Health Services Trade Union Alliance President Saman Rathnapriya said.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday he said however that the proposed increments had not even been presented to Parliament yet, and so there was nothing to worry about immediately. "At the moment the country is suffering from various burning issues - economic issues, farmers' issues, debt issues caused due to the conduct of the previous regime etc.," he said.
"It is unacceptable to increase MPs' allowance at this time," he said. "We request the Speaker to throw the proposal away."

Afghanistan fancying their chances
KOLKATA: Afghanistan cricket has come a long way since being given ODI and T20I status and are now threatening to take on full member teams without any fear. Their ranking as ninth in the ICC T20I championships behind eight ranked Sri Lanka has given them enough confidence that they can beat the current defending champions in their World T20 clash at Eden Gardens today.
Afghanistan failed to qualify for the Asia CupT20 but made a strong comeback to qualify for the World T20 and now look a definite threat to any team.
"We came through a tough qualifying round and this time we are not here to participate but looking forward to beating some good teams," said Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai with determination.
"In the Asia Cup unfortunately we dropped 6 or 7 catches against UAE that was the main reason we lost that game. We won the next two games but it was too late for us. After that we worked hard in all three departments and we are ready," he said.
The form book shows that Afghanistan has won nine of their last 10 T20 internationals whereas Sri Lanka has won only two of their last 10.
Their cricket has been boosted further by the appointment of former Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq as head coach last October.
Afghanistan will also take a lot of confidence from their last meeting with Sri Lanka where they nearly upset the form book by coming close to pulling off an unlikely win.
"The last time we came near to beating Sri Lanka in the World Cup 2015 but their experienced batsmen (Kumar) Sangakkara and (Mahela) Jayawardene who played an outstanding innings managed to beat us," said Stanikzai.
"But this time they don't have those names and most of their players are new so we have a good chance to beat them."

Pre-match: Lost in transition, defending champions Sri Lanka will look to come out of the rut and start well against a spirited Afghanistan in their World Twenty20 Super 10 opener at Eden Gardens.

The defending champions, who were also runners-up in 2009 and 2012, have managed to win only four of their 14 matches since they beat India to win the 2014 edition in Mirpur. They are in the middle of a transition phase after Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene's exit. (CricketNext)

Afridi powers Pakistan to big opening win
Kolkata, Wednesday: Skipper Shahid Afridi starred with bat and ball as he powered Pakistan to a comprehensive 55-run victory against Bangladesh in his team's opening match of the World Twenty20 in Kolkata on Wednesday. Afridi's blistering 19-ball 49 helped Pakistan post a commanding total of 201 for five and his two-wicket haul was instrumental in restricting Bangladesh to 146 for six from their 20 overs.
"Boom Boom" Afridi, whose batting form had fallen away in recent months, rose to the occasion after promoting himself to number four in the order.
The skipper smacked four boundaries and four sixes to help Pakistan register their second highest score in T20 internationals. Their highest total is 203 against the same opposition in 2009.
Opting to bat after winning the toss, Pakistani top-order batsmen Ahmed Shehzad (52) and Mohammad Hafeez (64) hit entertaining fifties to stitch a 95-run second wicket partnership and lay a solid foundation for others to build on.
The duo combined the right dose of caution and aggression to blunt the Bangladesh bowling attack, with the Tigers' captain Mashrafe Mortaza unable to stem the tide in the absence of injured bowler Mustafizur Rahman.
Shehzad, who was recalled after missing the recent Asia Cup, reached his fifth T20 international half-century in 35 deliveries. Hafeez was not far behind as the former skipper, who posted his ninth T20I fifty, struck seven fours and two sixes in his 42-ball stay.
The only bright spot for Bangladesh was a moment of brilliance in the field when Soumya Sarkar took a breathtaking catch on the boundary rope to bring an end to Hafeez's innings.
Bangladesh were never really in the hunt and their innings got off to a dreadful start when opener Soumya Sarkar was bowled by Mohammad Amir with only the third ball.
The in-form Tamim Iqbal and Sabbir Rahman put on 43 for the second wicket, but they both fell victim to Afridi and Bangladesh's chase fell away.

All measures to form UPFA govt. by 2020 - UPFA Gen. Sec.
UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said he would take all possible measures to form a UPFA government by 2020.
He said he would initially build a cordial rapport with all parties under the UPFA banner aiming to create a broader alliance that would go to form a UPFA government by 2020.
Minister Amaraweera made these remarks after assuming duties as the UPFA General Secretary at the Sri Lanka Freedom Party headquarters yesterday.
"My initial aim is to strengthen the UPFA by bringing many parties under its banner. Discussions will be held with parties which are in the UPFA to create a cordial rapport with each party. Initially, discussions will be held with 12 parties in the near future," he said.
Attention will be drawn towards attracting other parties which are currently not with the UPFA, but work closely with the UPFA during elections. As the final outcome, a broader alliance will be created under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena," he said. "Any party can join the UPFA aiming to achieve a common goal, if they accept the policies of the UPFA," he said.
Questioned whether disciplinary action will be taken against SLFP members those who participate in the protest launched by the joint opposition today, he said that decision will be taken by the SLFP Central Committee. Amaraweera noted that he was confident and certain that they can prevent a probable split in the UPFA. He said SLFP members will never work towards splitting the UPFA as they put the party first.
"Besides, they have very clearly understood that the UNP will benefit if the party splits," he said.
He added that the good governance government is neither a SLFP nor UNP government. Therefore, it is unethical to describe this is an UNP government. However, there should be discipline in the SLFP and the UPFA.
Speaking on development projects which are at a standstill, he said many of the proposed development and infrastructure development projects will commence by next month. It has been planned to start all key projects by next month.
Amaraweera requested people to be vigilant as certain politicians with vested interests are trying to arouse the people for their petty political gains.
"As a result of this situation, farmers have been protesting asking for a fertilizer subsidy. Being a son of a farmer, the President would never allow the curtailment of the fertiliser subsidy or any other benefits enjoyed by farmers," he said.
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said the UPFA will be driven towards victory by forming much broader alliance.
Former UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said he has undergone immense hardships as the UPFA General Secretary.
He and Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa are the only persons who know much about the UPFA.

## Title: Amendment to MP allowances soon : Karu

Amendment to MP allowances soon : Karu
The House Committee recently met with the participation of all parties representing Parliament to discuss the proposed amendment to the allowances currently paid to the MPs, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker said he hoped to thwart any false information likely to be generated as a result of the proposed amendments by addressing the media squarely on the issue.
In a statement to the media he said that although the need to increase the allowances of MPs exists, especially after the salary was increased for public servants, the matter had not been taken up owing to the elections. He said it was only after the Parliamentary election that everybody expected to take this matter into consideration.
For several years now, the statement read, MPs had pointed out that their transport allowance, document allowance, office allowance and other allowances were not timely or adequate in formulation. They proposed amendment to the allowances, noting that it was in 2007 - 9 years ago - that the allowances were last amended.
The statement added with the implementation of the 19th amendment, the duties and responsibilities of the Parliament and its members have become extensive: In addition to the days of Parliamentary Sittings, the participation of the MPs has become compulsory for the Sectoral Committees, which is the most recent formation initiated with the representation of MPs.
Salaries and allowances made to MPs in Sri Lanka is relatively low compared to the salaries and allowances paid to South Asia and other countries, the statement read. Taking into consideration all of these factors, the House Committee has proposed that:
(1) Rs. 50,000 allowance is paid only to the MPs who are unable to get a house from the Madiwela quarters. In order to participate in Parliament sittings, they have to spend money out of their own pockets and stay at hotels or in private houses. Therefore the aforementioned allowance is to be paid to only seven MPs who applied for lodgings from the Madiwela quarters but were not provided it.
(2) Although telephone bills up to Rs. 40,000 are reimbursed at present, wi-fi and internet facilities have not been given to the MPs. It was proposed to pay an allowance of Rs. 10,000 in place of all these services. It is the responsibility of Parliament to provide modern technological services to MPs. Attention of the House Committee was drawn to the fact that it would enable an improved service and make affairs of Parliament administration more convenient.
(3) It is essential to maintain an office to provide services to the public. This proposal was made because it is absolutely impossible to do so with the salary that is paid at present. A sum of Rs.75,000 has been proposed as the allowance for maintaining an office after taking the maintenance cost of the building, office equipment and other things into consideration.
4). Members will receive the allowance for the meetings of the Constitutional Assembly and meetings of Sectoral Committees only if they participate in such meetings on non-sitting days. As members have to incur additional expenses to travel to the Parliament complex in order to attend such meetings on non-sitting days, it has been proposed that each participating member be paid an allowance of Rs. 4,000/-, while a Chairperson will be paid an allowance of Rs. 5,000/- per meeting.
(5). It was proposed that each member be paid an allowance of Rs. 2,500/- for participating in sittings of the Parliament as a Constitutional Assembly on non-sitting days for the purpose of acting as a legislative assembly. Payment of this allowance will be terminated after the task of preparing a new Constitution has been completed.
(6) Although there have been reports regarding provision of special meals, the recommendation of the Committee was to provide a tasty, low-cost meal instead of providing a variety of food items and curries.
The meetings of the House Committee and Committee on Parliamentary Business during which these decisions were made was attended by representatives from all political parties who were in agreement regarding these decisions. The Speaker said in his statement to the media however, that the government has not yet reached a definite conclusion regarding the aforesaid proposals.

Gayle-force blows away England at World T20
Mumbai, Wednesday: Chris Gayle blasted a scintillating century to propel the West Indies to a stunning six-wicket win against England in their World Twenty20 opener in Mumbai on Wednesday.
The powerful left-hander smashed 11 sixes and five fours as the Windies successfully chased down England's score of 182 for six at the Wankhede Stadium.
Destructive opener Gayle was largely off-strike in the opening stages of the Super 10 Group One clash but lit up the tournament when the opportunity came his way. He hit two consecutive sixes off spinner Adil Rashid in the ninth over as the West Indies sat at 85 for two at the half-way stage of their innings.
Gayle, 36, then repeated the feat against Ben Stokes in the 11th as he single-handedly took control of the Windies' assault on England's total.
Opener Johnson Charles had gone for nought in the first over while Marlon Samuels had made a speedy 37 before being caught deep by David Willey off Rashid.
Denesh Ramdin went for 12 while Dwayne Bravo could manage only two, but Gayle remained destructive as partners fell around him.
The Jamaican, who was accused of sexism after he asked an Australian TV presenter for a date live on air in January during the Big Bash League, hit one monstrous six after another.
He clinched his century in the 18th over with a quick single as he finished on 100 not out from 48 balls. Andre Russell hit the winning run as the West Indies beat the target set them in 18.1 overs.
England's stand came after West Indies captain Darren Sammy won the toss and elected to field. AFP

KOLKATA: Sri Lanka's champion fast bowler Lasith Malinga looked a doubtful starter for today's (Thursday) opening World T20 match against Afghanistan at Eden Gardens here.
"We are yet to get a 'yes' or a 'no' from the team physio. Malinga will have a net session tomorrow to test his bowling out and we will get to know his condition. He bowled a couple of overs today with his short run up. He will bowl with his full run up tomorrow then the physio will assess his fitness and let us know," said Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.

Under-performing Sri Lanka wary of unpredictable Afghans
KOLKATA: Sri Lanka a far cry from the team that won the World T20 title two years ago will open their defence to retain it when they take on Afghanistan at Eden Gardens under lights today.
Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lanka Test and ODI captain now saddled with the burden of leading the team in all three formats including the T20 comparing the two sides (2014 and present) said, "We had a very settled team in the last World Cup T20 with Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) and Mahela (Mahela Jayawardene) but now we can't talk about them all the time, we have to take up the challenge. It's just that we need the team to settle down a bit. It has not settled down in the last few months, the more it settles down, the less worries we'll have. "As defending champions we are not under any pressure because I don't think anyone will give us a chance to win this World Cup. We go as underdogs and it takes the pressure off us. We just have to go and play with a lot of freedom which we did in the last two warm-up games. We can't have the fear of losing because in a T20 you have to keep going. We just have to take that fear of failure off. We have nothing to lose just go out there and play with a lot of freedom and be positive."
Mathews assessed Afghanistan as an unpredictable side and he clearly remembers how close they came to beat Sri Lanka in the Cricket World Cup game in Dunedin in February last year. It was Mahela Jayawardene's century that saw Sri Lanka sneak through to win by four wickets after being reduced to 18-3 chasing 233.
"You can't really predict how they play. They are a very forceful team when it comes to cricket, they have a very good bowling attack and we have to be on top of our game to win against them. We can't treat them lightly at all we will take Afghanistan very seriously and try to beat them," said Mathews.
"The first game is always important when you are going into a series or a big tournament like this in a World Cup. If you can win and get the momentum on your side it will give a lot of confidence to our team and then we can take anyone on. We have to really focus on the first game and try to get that win under our belt."
One of the core issues during the Asia Cup was the constant changing of the batting order which affected the batting unit.
"We don't want to change our batting order a lot that has been our worry. We learnt a lesson in the Asia Cup by doing that. We will go for a settled batting order but at times we may have to tactically move someone up and down it all depends on the opposition as well. We will use them according to the conditions and opponents," said Mathews.
"As of now Lahiru (Thirimanne) will bat at number three. Of the batters he has batted the best. He gives that stability to the batting order which we needed. I am really glad that he has taken up the task and performed really well for us," he said.
In the two warm-up games Thirimanne top scored for Sri Lanka with 41 off 29 balls against New Zealand and 45 off 37 balls against Pakistan. His exclusion from the Asia Cup was criticized by ex-Sri Lankan stars Aravinda de Silva and Kumar Sangakkara who are currently members of the new selection panel.
