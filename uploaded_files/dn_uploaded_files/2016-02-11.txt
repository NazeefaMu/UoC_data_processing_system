India should have shown more respect to Sri Lanka - Gavaskar
PUNE: The defeat to a depleted Sri Lanka in the first T20 international was a good wake-up call for the Indians, according to former captain Sunil Gavaskar, who said the batsmen should have shown more respect given that the Lankan pace trio was an unknown proposition.
Put into bat, India were off to a disastrous start losing two wickets in the first over itself, eventually getting bowled out for 101.
"If you see India had lost two wickets in the first over and then Shikhar Dhawan got out trying to play a hoick for a six when in the same over we have had Suresh Raina hitting a six and a boundary, so there were enough runs scored in that over.
"And what India really need to think was the fact that this new attack of Sri Lanka they haven't really seen it. You might see videos but when you are playing them for the first time it's just that little bit difficult," he said.
"These guys were bowling well, pitching the ball on a good length, getting the ball to move around. So, maybe a little bit of caution was called for particularly after India lost their first two wickets in the first over and maybe given the bowlers just that little bit more respect, then they could have got 30-40 runs which could have made the difference," Gavaskar said.
On a lively track, which had fair amount of bounce and seam movement, India were skittled out for a paltry total in 18.5 overs with the rookie pace trio of Kasun Rajitha (3/29), Dashun Shanaka (3/16) and Dushmantha Chameera (2/14) doing bulk of the damage.
With the five-wicket defeat India's winning sequence in T20 internationals came to an embarrassing end.
"My honest advice now is that it's a very, very good wake-up call for the Indians having seen what the Sri Lankans can do. They should be better prepared for the remaining two matches," Gavsakar said.
India came into the series on the back of a 3-0 sweep of Australia in a T20 series Down Under. Even as they scored tons of runs in Australia, back home the Indian batsmen struggled.
"I think there was a bit of a hangover of playing in Australia where you play a little bit on the up and don't really lean into the drive which is what was needed on a surface like this.
It was an impossible pitch to bat on, I think there was just a little bit of movement which is what you would get even on a grass-less pitch, particularly when you play at 7.30 in the evening the dew will make the ball move around just that little bit," Gavaskar said.
"But I think instead of playing upright leaning closer to ball would have helped. And then there were a couple of shots which were really not necessary for the stage the Indian team was in, there was no partnership, so really everything went wrong for the Indian team."

Karisma Kapoor - Real reason why she is not doing films
Actress Karisma Kapoor on Saturday avoided questions related to the controversy surrounding her divorce and also said that she wasn't ready for films now. Present at the Nykaa.com Femina Beauty Awards, Karisma was asked about the ongoing reports related to her divorce, but before the question could be completed, she said: "No comments, thank you," and walked away.
According to reports, the divorce petition filed by her husband Sunjay Kapur claimed that she had married him for his money and that she had failed not only as a wife and daughter-in-law but also as a mother. He also claimed that she didn't allow their kids, whose custody battle is going on, to meet him.
Karisma's lawyer had said that they'll tell the court he was causing great harm to the children by spreading false stories and by talking about the issue in public. Karisma was last seen in 'Dangerous Ishqa', a film which was hyped as her comeback.
About hardly being spotted nowadays, she said: "I selectively leave the house. I think family is most important and my kids are most important. So I'm very happy being at home, so now you'll ask me if I'm going to do a film, but I'm not ready to do a movie, and whenever I feel like doing it, I will do it."

Monkey rescues puppy, adopts it
INDIA: A monkey in the busy Muthuvelen street of Erode district in Tamil Nadu has adopted an abandoned pup after rescuing it from ferocious dogs.
Passers-by are not only curious, but also overcome by emotion as the protective simian does not allow anyone to come near the young one.
The monkey immediately undertook the role of a mother by protecting the helpless pup from bigger stray dogs and also feeding what ever food it gets from the passers-by.
The "unofficial adoption" took place just couple of weeks back when a newborn puppy was abandoned by his mother. "When there was an unusual barking noise, we came out of our house and saw that a homeless puppy was almost about to be killed by mongrels. However, suddenly a monkey came from a tree nearby and chased away the strays and took the puppy away before rescuing it", K Srinivasan, an eye-witness of the rare story, said.
"Touched by the emotional bond of this mismatched family, we started to feed them biscuits and milk", he added.
The macaque not only made sure to carry her "newly-adopted son" wherever she goes, but also ensures to play with the dog whenever it required. "It (monkey) takes the puppy even to the tree top to play. It is amazing to see the monkey keeping a tight hold on the dog even when she climbs the tree", K Saradha, a resident and house wife, said.
According to Saradha, what ever the monkey gets, it made sure that her "son" eats first and then takes the leftovers.

Priyankara Rathnayake's Premawantha Kumarayo on stage tomorrow
All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.
As the worlds greatest dramatist William Shakespeare once said, this outstanding personality had played many roles in his theater of life. Priyankara Rathnayake extended his dominance on stage, television and cinema in the Sinhala and English artistic fields since 80s.
Rathnayake,a Senior Lecturer at the Department of Fine Arts,at Kelaniya University, teaches theatre; the only place which offers it as a separate subject, and leads Academic Players of Drama and Theatre and Image Arts unit, University of Kelaniya which had won several awards over the years.
He, who is credited for introducing Sophocles to the local theatre, took a different route directing Aristophanes' Lysistrata on 2012.
Ratnayakes effort to explain ancient western classics in the local theatre takes a new dimension as he stages Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream Premawantha Kumarayo along with the award winning Academic Players.
On a Midsummers night, four young lovers find themselves wrapped in the dream-like arms of an enchanted forest where sprites lurk and fairies rule. While a feuding Fairy King and Queen are at war, their paths are crossed by Bottom, Quince and their friends presenting a play within a play. Chief mischief-maker Puck is on-hand to ensure that the course of true love is anything but smooth, and games of fantasy, love and dreams ensue in Shakespeares most beguiling comedy.
Translated by Jayawathi Jayasinghe the world renowned Shakespeares comedy play will be performed as never before by the Academic Playerson the 12th and 13th of February at Lionel Wendt.
Produced by Lal Handpangoda
Directed by Priyankara Rathnayake
Music composed by Pramith Dahanayaka
Choreography created by Harshani Rathnayake and Priyankara Rathnayake.

Special school called ISIS in UK forced to change name
UK: A special school in the UK called 'The Isis Academy' has been forced to change its name after jibes about pupils being trained as 'terrorists'.
The school in Oxford, which was named three years ago, was named after part of the River Thames which flows nearby and is known as 'The Isis'.
However, the academy has now been renamed as 'The Iffley Academy' to avoid confusion with the dreaded ISIS terror group, following a series of "negative comments" online, the Daily Express reported.
Head teacher Kay Willett decided to change the name after being asked are you training the children to be terrorists and photos of pupils and terrorists appeared when she searched the school online, the report said.
"We had negative comments from the wider community such as contractors and people who were coming to do work for us. You would give the address out on the phone and when you said 'Isis' the person would pause and say 'oh'," she said.
"Anybody who did not know the nature of the school would make comments like 'are you training the children to be terrorists;" said Ms Willett.
The 132-pupil special school, whose pupils have a range of disabilities and mental health needs, was known as Iffley Mead School until it became an academy three years ago.
"Many of our students aged 10 to 18 have autism and mental health needs and they rely on us to give out positive messages about life. When we told them why the name was going to change they were happy with that," she added.

Supreme Court puts Obama carbon emissions plan on hold
US: The US Supreme Court has put on hold President Barack Obama's sweeping plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fueled power plants pending a legal challenge.
A coalition of 27 US states is suing in a lower court to halt Obama's Clean Power Plan, and petitioned the Supreme Court to suspend its implementation until the case is resolved.
Most of the states involved are run by Obama's Republican adversaries.
The White House responded by saying it was convinced the ambitious plan would prevail.
"We disagree with the Supreme Court's decision to stay the Clean Power Plan while litigation proceeds," spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement issued after the five-to-four ruling.
"We remain confident that we will prevail on the merits."
Tuesday's ruling, backed by five of the nine Supreme Court justices, deals a significant blow to Obama's efforts to rein in man-made climate change. The court's four liberal voices contested the decision to halt the emission rules, which would require the power sector's carbon dioxide emissions to be slashed by at least 32 percent compared to 2005 levels by the year 2030.
The far-reaching regulations issued last summer by the Environmental Protection Agency form a core of Obama's efforts to reduce overall US greenhouse gas emissions.
But many US conservatives deny that climate change is caused by human industry and agriculture, and have opposed emissions controls designed to slow global warming.
The federal programme was a central part of the commitments put forward by Washington ahead of the Paris climate deal struck by 195 governments in December.
Democratic White House hopeful Bernie Sanders voiced bitter disappointment, as voting wrapped up in the New Hampshire presidential primary. "The Supreme Court's decision is deeply disappointing. There's no time to spare in the fight to combat climate change," he tweeted. But the attorney general for West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, hailed it as a major victory against efforts to regulate the coal industry.
"Hope. Coal miners and their families should have more hope tonight after our unprecedented victory at the US Supreme Ct. We stayed the CPP!" tweeted Morrissey, whose state leads the group opposing the Obama plan.
The EPA rules have incensed Republicans, particularly lawmakers from coal-producing states. They argue that the economic cost of the endeavour would cripple industry and hike energy costs for millions of Americans.

Trump, Sanders win New Hampshire primary
US: Senator Bernie Sanders defeated Hillary Clinton in the New Hampshire state Democratic primary, while real estate mogul Donald Trump was projected to win in the crowded Republican field with the final finishing order yet to be settled.
With 92% of precincts reporting, Sanders was holding onto 60% of the vote with Clinton carrying 38%. Trump was capturing 35% of the Republican primary vote, better than twice the count for second-place John Kasich.
Sanders' victory in the first-in-the-nation primary, after his razor-thin loss to Clinton in the Iowa caucuses on Feb 1, means the party could be headed for a long and competitive nominating fight.
With a win in New Hampshire, Trump re-assumed his front-runner status in the Republican nominating contest after finishing second in the Iowa caucuses on Feb 1 to Texas Senator Ted Cruz, despite leading state and national polls for months.
Clinton's defeat - by a 74-year-old Democratic socialist, in a state she won in 2008 - is sure to stoke worries among her supporters about her strength in upcoming contests, even as she still is on track to win the Democratic nomination.
Sanders had led polls by double digits in New Hampshire for months, and Clinton never seriously challenged him for a win there, even after she narrowly beat Sanders in Iowa.
Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, essentially conceded the race in a statement released right as final polls closed at 8 a.m. (Thailand time) in New Hampshire.
In an attempt to assure Clinton supporters, he said splitting the first two contests was "an outcome we've long anticipated."
The campaign was focusing now on the next two contests, caucuses in Nevada and a primary in South Carolina, "and we feel very good about our prospects for success," Mook said.
"The nomination will very likely be won in March, not February, and we believe that Hillary Clinton is well positioned to build a strong - potentially insurmountable - delegate lead next month," he said.
While her campaign tried to dismiss Sanders' lead in New Hampshire as "home-field advantage" as a New England candidate, polling data showed that Clinton had lost support since 2008 among women - especially young women - as well as blue-collar workers and those earning less than $50,000 a year.
It showed why Sanders' message of a rigged economy benefiting the wealthy is resonating .

FRANCE: The world's tourism map is being redrawn at lightning speed as holidaymakers switch preferences prompted by terror attacks, epidemics and migrant crises.
Jihadist attacks on tourists in Tunisia last year and the Oct 31 crash of a Russian plane which took off from its Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh have devastated the tourism sectors in both countries.
But Muslim countries everywhere are the main losers of the shift in tastes, sector professionals say, as tourists move to destinations they consider safe -- so long as they're also sunny.

BCCI may suffer financial loss of Rs 1600 crore
NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is set to suffer a financial loss to the tune of Rs 1600 crore if Lodha Panel's recommendations on curtailing the advertisement breaks during the matches is implemented.
It is feared that in the wake of loss of revenue not only the smooth functioning of country's richest sporting body will be hit but also the development of junior cricket in the country.
According to BCCI balance sheet, the operative revenue currently is approximately Rs 2000 crore, a large chunk of which comes from broadcasting rights and advertisement revenues.
But if Lodha Panel recommendation, which wants the advertisements only during "lunch, tea or drinks break", then it would come down to Rs 400 crore.
According to a reliable source in the board, the Star Sports, which has the broadcasting rights of BCCI's matches, currently gives Rs 43 crore per match and such a rule could see BCCI earning as less as Rs 8-10 crore per match.
"Yes, it is true that we are facing a situation which could lead to a revenue loss of Rs 1600 crore. Star Sports will renegotiate their deal and may be pay us only 20-25 percent of the amount that we get currently per match. Ditto for IPL broadcasters," a source in the know of things told PTI on conditions of anonymity.
The far-reaching implication of this could mean that during India's away tours, the hosts countries such as England, New Zealand or Australia will earn more than India out of the broadcast deals. - PTI

Contract dispute threatens West Indies on eve of World T20
Protesting players of the West Indies team could be axed from the national squad for the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 in March-April if they fail to accept the financial contracts offered by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) by February 14, the board said on Tuesday.
WICB has taken the hard-hitting stand after it was revealed that the 15-man squad has rejected the offered contracts, unhappy with the huge pay cut.
Darren Sammy, West Indies captain, wrote a letter to the WICB, stating that the financial terms for the World T20, which starts on March 8, were unacceptable.
"We want to represent the West Indies but the financials on offer we can't accept," Sammy wrote in his letter to the board. "We have collectively discussed the remuneration on offer to participate in the T20 World Cup. Considering that 14 out of the 15-man squad are not part of West Indies Players' Association (WIPA) - and hence have not given authorisation to WIPA to negotiate on our behalf - and a large number do not receive any significant remuneration from WICB at all, we want the opportunity to negotiate fairly the financial terms within the contract."
WICB, however, is not ready to negotiate the terms, Michael Muirhead, the board's chief executive, told a Jamaican radio channel.
"The WICB is committed to play in the tournament, let me say that first," Muirhead said. "No one will leave the shores of the West Indies without signing a contract, and if these players in particular choose not to sign, then I guess we'll be left with no option but to substitute other players for them."
Muirhead also added that the board was not in a position to improve the remuneration package, as the terms were negotiated with the players association nine months ago.
"They have had lots of time to digest and argue and do everything," he said. "Five of the players were instrumental and were there at the onset, so at this point, I'm hoping that the players will sign and take advantage of the other benefits that are there."
Sammy has called for an emergency meeting with the officials ahead of their deadline, and has proposed that the players will participate in the ICC mega event under the same conditions as during previous tournaments. Sammy said the players, who were facing a pay cut of nearly 80 percent, would earn only $21,000 each this edition as compared to $135,000 at the last tournament.
West Indies, who won the 2012 World Twenty20 title in Sri Lanka, are currently second in the ICC T20I rankings.
The latest disagreement between WICB and its players comes around 18 months after the premature end of West Indies' tour of India because of a long-standing payment dispute.
West Indies squad for World T20: Darren Sammy (captain), Samuel Badree, Sulieman Benn, Darren Bravo, Dwayne Bravo, Andre Fletcher, Chris Gayle, Jason Holder, Sunil Narine, Kieron Pollard, Denesh Ramdin, Andre Russell, Marlon Samuels, Lendl Simmons, Jerome Taylor.

'IS deployed 60 jihadists in Europe to attack 5 cities'
US: ISIS deployed 60 jihadists in Europe as part of a plot to carry out attacks on five cities including London, Paris and Berlin before the carnage it unleashed in the French capital, according to a media report.
Intelligence obtained by Western security agencies before the November 13 Paris attacks indicated that Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, the head of ISIS' external operations efforts, was the key figure behind the ambitious plot, CNN reported citing a senior European counter-terrorism source.
As many as 60 ISIS fighters had been deployed by the group to Europe to carry out attacks on five cities and had already reached European soil, the source said.
The intelligence indicated that the target cities included Paris, London, Berlin and a major population centre in Belgium. However, there was no indication the plan was to attack the cities simultaneously. The source cautioned that the threat stream was based on intelligence which was fragmentary and difficult to verify, and it was too vague to act on.
In addition, there was no specific intelligence prior to the Paris attack on any moving parts of the plot, the report said. "In terms of ambition, it also just pointed towards something we already knew.
ISIS had hardly made it a secret it sought to target Europe," the source was quoted as saying.
In the year before the Paris attacks, Adnani had threatened the European countries supporting the anti-ISIS coalition in a series of audio messages, making specific references to France and Belgium.
And in January 2015, Belgian police broke up a major ISIS plot in Belgium coordinated by Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who later became the ringleader of the Paris attacks in which jihadists slaughtered 130 people in a series of bombings and shootings. The source said Western intelligence agencies believe Adnani is at the heart of ISIS' international attack planning.
"As far as we're concerned, he is top of our target list," the source said. The source said the lack of specific intelligence on any moving parts of the Paris plot has caused consternation, because it is rare for any plot to fly completely under the radar.
Western security agencies had picked up at least some specific chatter on planning, which they later realised related to the attack, the source said.
After the Paris attacks, new attention was focused on the fragmentary intelligence indicating 60 ISIS operatives had been deployed to Europe.
"The worry has been that if, say, 20 were involved in the Paris attacks, there might be 40 or so still out there," the source said.
