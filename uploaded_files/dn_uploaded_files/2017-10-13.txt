Cyber Security Headquarters to be established at Sri Lanka Airforce

The Ministry of Defence (MoD) will establish their Cyber Security Headquarters at the Sri Lanka Airforce (SLAF), a MoD official said.
This unit will have representations from the tri-forces and the police force and will work towards improving cyber security capabilities and intelligence for national security purposes.
The MoD official said the SLAF Commander, Air Marshall, Kapila Jayampathy, had initially volunteered to set up a cyber security system for the army and was later expanded to all forces.
The official said this as he answered questions on how prepared the forces were to deal with cyber security threats at the Colombo Air Symposium.
At present the Airforce which deals with the most advanced technologies of the tri-forces has the most comprehensive cyber security system.
Thus it was natural that the SLAF would take a leading role in setting up the system for all security forces.
National Institute of Security Studies, Researcher, Priyanka Moonasinghe who presented on The Role of Cyber Espionage as an Asymmetric Threat through Air Power at the Air Symposium speaking on the SLAF cyber security system said the Information and Technology Unit of the SLAF had direct domain control and monitoring of over 4000 computers with internal and external networks.
They operate from 25 bases centrally connected to one administrative controller.
In an effort to minimize threats from the cyber domain, the staff is not allowed to install hardware or software or use external storage devices, with the exception of few designated computers. This safeguards them against threats such as Red October, said Moonasinghe.
Red October was a cyber-attack launched on many government agencies around the world, mainly in Eastern Europe, Central Asia and former Soviet nations to steal sensitive security information.
The SLAF system which has many networks also has many layers of defence and is multipronged, making it harder for hackers, she further explained.
The SLAF also has a Cyber Command Operations Centre which is the cyber security and monitoring section that gathers intelligence on a 24 hour basis to inspect threats from the cyber domain.
The Operation Centre conducts cyber threats on its own system to identify its loopholes and fix them.

Escape attempt at Colombo Chief Magistrates' Court: Ukrainian shot at

A prison official today opened fire in the Colombo Chief Magistrates' Court premises when a Ukrainian national who had been convicted of committing the murder of eight-year-old Chinese child made an aborted attempt to escape from prison custody.
The shooting caused no harm to the foreign prisoner but a prison official ended up wounded and was taken to hospital.
Mazur Yevgen was brought before Colombo Chief Magistrates' Court over another case by prison authorities.
The Supreme Court had affirmed the conviction and the death sentence imposed against this Ukrainian national for committing the murder of an eight-year-old Chinese child and the baby sitter at Nawala on February 23, 2010.
However, the Supreme Court had acquitted the Ukrainian wife of all charges levelled against her including the murder of two individuals.
On June 16, 2014, Mazur Yevgen and his wife Yana Berezhna were found guilty of murdering an eight-year-old Chinese child and the baby sitter by the High Court Trial-at-Bar Bench.

Sathosa reduces the price of coconuts to Rs. 65

The Coconut Cultivation Board and Lanka Sathosa have jointly taken measures to provide coconuts at Rs 65.
Accordingly the consumers will receive the opportunity to purchase 5 coconuts for 65 rupees at Sathosa outlets.
Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairman Kapila Yakandawala said that the CCB has already issued one million coconuts to the market.
Measures would be taken to supply four million coconuts to the market by next month.
Then we would be able to completely normalize the price of coconuts, he said.
He said around 70,000 coconuts have been supplied to 180 urban Sathosa outlets and Kapruka societies have also been informed to supply coconuts directly to Sathosa outlets.
Yakandawala said the program to provide coconuts to the public at a concessionary price was launched by the CCB with the intention of controlling unusual price hike.
As a result of this we would be able to control the unnecessary profits earned by traders, he said.

Sumanthiran files fresh FR against Swaminathan

Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran has filed a fresh Fundamental Rights petition seeking an Interim Order preventing any steps being taken by Minister D.M. Swaminathan with regard to entering into a contract with a French construction company to construct 65,000 of prefabricated steel houses in the North and Eastern Provinces.
At a previous occasion, Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran decided to withdraw his FR petition which had been filed over the same issue amidst respondents objections that the Cabinet of Ministers who took this decision had not been named as parties in the petition.
However, in his new petition, MP Sumanthiran cited D.M. Swaminathan the Minister of Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs, Cabinet of Ministers, Arcellor Mittal Construction France and the Attorney General as respondents.
When the petition came up before Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Priyantha Jayawardena, the Court re-issued notices on the respondents. The petition was fixed for support onNovember 21.
The petitioners stated that there are irregularities in the tender process awarding the contract to construct houses for the war affected to the French company.
He further said that there is lack of durability of the said prefabricated steel houses and environmental unsuitability of the said prefabricated houses.
The petitioner further alleged that the respondents are not employing local labour in the implementation of the project to construct the said prefabricated houses.
I am further aware that the District Co-ordinating committees of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Districts of which I am a member also passed unanimous decision on or around 27th September 2016 rejecting the said prefabricated steel houses, the petitioner further said.
