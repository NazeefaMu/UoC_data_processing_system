China will support SL to be information, telecommunication hub in region
Giving a further fillip to bilateral cooperation between China and Sri Lanka, the Chinese government is planning to support Sri Lanka to be the information and telecommunication hub in the region.
To this end, the Chinese government intends to utilise a significant proportion of its donations to Sri Lanka for the development of the technology and innovation sphere in the years ahead, Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang revealed.
He was speaking at the second Broadband forum, organized by the Ministry of Telecommunication and Infrastructure in collaboration with global leader in ICT Solutions, Huawei.
Highlighting the importance of developing the ICT and telecommunication sector infrastructure in Sri Lanka, the Ambassador stressed the need for more investment in the information and telecommunications industry, considering it as a priority area in order to enable digitization and fulfill the set economic goals.
China has no hesitation to support Sri Lanka to be the information and telecommunication hub in the region, the Ambassador said.
The Ambassador, speaking on the Hambantota Port deal, emphasised that the Port will be used as a commercial port and will be open to the world.
This is a joint venture project and the Port cannot be used by one country. We do what we can; we do what we say; most importantly, business issues should not be politicized.
China Sri Lanka Co-operation is open, inclusive and transparent, he said.
While expressing satisfaction over the progress made by Sri Lanka in the field of information and telecommunication, he noted that the telecommunication sector should be the basis of all other hubs which include aviation, naval and maritime, knowledge, commercial and energy hubs.
According to the Ambassador, the Chinese government has disbursed Yuan 1.5 billion in aid to Sri Lanka to supplement various development projects and charities during the period 2014-2017.In addition, the Chinese government has pledged Yuan 2 billion in aid to Sri Lanka for the period 2018-2020.
The Ambassador also expressed hope that not only Huawei, but also other leading telco companies would come forward to invest in Sri Lankas telecommunication sector to create much needed business opportunities for the benefit of involving parties and for the progress of the Sri Lankan people.

Devastation in Florida Keys as Irma weakens
US: Millions of Florida residents were without power and extensive damage was reported in the Florida Keys but most of the Sunshine State appeared to have dodged forecasts of catastrophic damage from Hurricane Irma.
The monster storm roared ashore as a powerful Category 4 hurricane when it hit the Keys southern island chain on Sunday, ripping boats from their moorings, flattening palm trees and downing power lines, after devastating a string of Caribbean islands.
By the time it hit the peninsula the storm had been downgraded and weakened further to a tropical depression late Monday.
But while Florida may have escaped the worst, the death toll jumped to at least 40 after Cuba said 10 people had been killed there over the weekend as Irma spun northward.
Across the Caribbean, hard-hit residents struggled to get back on their feet as Britain, France, the Netherlands and the United States ramped up relief efforts for their overseas territories.
Florida residents who spent an anxious night huddled indoors were venturing out Monday to survey the damage, which did not seem to be as bad as initially feared.
If this had been a Category 4 hurricane the whole scenario would have been completely different, said Bob Lutz, a 62-year-old business owner.
More than 6.5 million customers in Florida were without power, however, and Governor Rick Scott said the Keys had suffered a lot of damage.
Its horrible what we saw, Scott said after flying over the island chain with the Coast Guard. The storm downed power lines, felled trees and left debris and vehicles strewn across the streets. But concrete homes appeared to have withstood the gusts.
Though Irma was downgraded to a tropical depression, forecasters warned of life-threatening surf and rip currents.
Floridas northeastern city of Jacksonville, population 880,000, ordered urgent evacuations amid record flooding along the St Johns River. In flood-prone Miami, the largest US city in Irmas path, cleaning crews were busy clearing branches, debris and fallen street signs from downtown.
In Bonita Springs, a city of 50,000 people on Floridas hard-hit southwest coast, large areas were flooded and the entire city was without power. Some residents were trying to reach their homes by walking through floodwater up to their waists, while others paddled canoes.
As residents began to check out their homes, authorities warned of downed power lines, raw sewage in floodwaters and -- this being Florida -- displaced wildlife like snakes and alligators.
Dont think just because this has passed you can run home, Governor Scott said. We have downed power lines all across the state.
Before reaching the United States, Irma smashed through a string of Caribbean islands from tiny Barbuda on Wednesday, to the tropical paradises of Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin, the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos Islands.
Panama said it was distributing at least 90 tonnes of humanitarian aid to Saint Martin and Cuba, while Venezuela -- itself beset by shortages amid a crippling economic crisis -- has sent 30 tonnes of food, potable water and supplies to Cuba and other Caribbean islands.
About 400 exhausted and traumatized survivors of Hurricane Irma arrived in France and the Netherlands on Monday aboard military planes.
An aircraft with 278 aboard landed in Paris, while another 100 people flew into Eindhoven in the southern Netherlands from the Guadeloupe capital Pointe-a-Pitre.
Both the French and Dutch governments have come under criticism over delays in their responses to the crisis and in particular over how they handled outbreaks of looting on Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin, an island with both French and Dutch sectors. - AFP

Anger in Singapore as first female president is elected without a vote

An establishment stalwart has been named Singapores first female president but the milestone was overshadowed by criticism that her selection was undemocratic after she was handed the job without a vote.
Halimah Yacob, a former speaker of parliament from the Muslim Malay minority, did not have to face an election for the largely ceremonial post after authorities decided her rivals did not meet strict eligibility criteria.
It was not the first time in the affluent city-state  which is tightly controlled and has been ruled by the same party for decades  that the government has disqualified candidates for the presidency, making an election unnecessary.
But there had already been criticism of the process as it was the first time the presidency had been reserved for a particular ethnic group  in this case the Malay community  and the decision to hand her the job without a vote added to anger.
Social media was abuzz with criticism as Halimah, 63, was formally announced as the president-elect, with Facebook user Pat Eng writing: Elected without an election. What a joke.
I will call her President Select from now on, said Joel Kong on the networking site, while some posts were marked with the hashtag #NotMyPresident  echoing the message used by upset Americans after the election of Donald Trump.
Halimah, a member of parliament for the ruling Peoples Action Party for nearly two decades before resigning to contest the presidency, tackled the doubts about the selection process in a speech to a cheering crowd after she was named president-elect.
Im a president for everyone. Although theres no election, my commitment to serve you remains the same, she said.
Authorities had decided to allow only candidates from the Malay community to put themselves forward for the presidency, a bid to foster harmony in the city-state of 5.5 million people, which is dominated by ethnic Chinese.
Singapores head of state has limited powers, including vetoing senior official appointments, but an establishment figure has always held the role and there are rarely tensions with the government.

My client was held at the commission until around 2.40 p.m. yesterday. By that time the banks were almost closed. We will submit the required bank statements by tomorrow. Premaratne PC assured.
Meanwhile, Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake informed the commission that W.M. Mendis & Company has not provided the commission with certain documents requested.
Premaratne PC informed the commission that the said documents will be handed over to the commission on Wednesday as well.
He also informed the commission that the telephone call recordings extracted from Aloysius mobile phone has not yet been given to him for perusal. He requested for the said data at least 24 hours before cross examining his client.

Arundika sacked
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday dismissed Arundika Fernando from the Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Deputy Ministerial portfolio.
The Presidents Media Division in a brief note said the Deputy Minister was sacked in accordance with the power vested in the President by the Constitution, under the clause 46 (3) (a).
The decision was effective from yesterday. The press statement however did not mention any official reason for the sudden move. Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala told the Daily News that the main reason for the Presidents decision to sack Fernando was the breach of collective responsibility of the Government.
Arundika Fernando overwhelmingly criticised the Government and the President. He often worked to his private agenda and went against the party decisions violating party discipline, he said.
Parliamentarian Arundika Fernando, speaking to the Daily News following his dismissal, said he will continue to be in the SLFP as well as the Government. Asked whether he would support the Government moves even in the future, the MP said he will selectively support what he thinks good for the country and its people.
Asked whether he would join in the events organized by the Joint Opposition, he said he has not yet taken such a decision. He said he was not informed of the reasons for his sacking.
However, a high ranking member of the SLFP said the main concerns against the former deputy minister would be revealed at a special press conference today.
He said Fernandos affairs with former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga are among those concerns.
Fernando publicly threatened to leave the government and refrained from voting for several important laws in Parliament. Added to these, there are many other charges against him, he said.
Fernando was appointed as the Tourism Promotion and Christian Affairs Deputy Minister on September 9, 2015.
It was barely three weeks ago, the President sacked Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his Justice and Buddha Sasana ministerial portfolios following a request from the UNP.

Aussies will have advantage in India, says Clarke
NEW DELHI Tuesday: Former skipper Michael Clarke said Tuesday the Australians would likely upstage hosts India in the upcoming one-day series thanks to their stints with the Indian Premier League.
The Steve Smith-led side, which lost the Test series 2-1 to India earlier this year, will play five ODIs, with the first in Chennai on Sunday.
Smith captained the Pune franchise in the last edition of the cash-rich IPL, arguably the worlds most popular Twenty20 tournament.
Players like David Warner, Aaron Finch, Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins have had successful IPL stints and Clarke said the team should have no excuses in the shorter format.
Its not just the wicket you are batting on or the ground you are playing, its the heat, the food you eat, the hotel your are staying at, Clarke told reporters.
(With) these players now being involved in the IPL, India is like a second home because you spend so much time here.
Yes, its a shame we dont have Mitchell Starc or Josh Hazlewood available unfortunately due to injury. Those two will be missed.
But this Australian team has no excuses. They know the conditions really well... and this is a massive series for us, he said, predicting a 3-2 win for the visitors.
Clarke saw a carrot right there for the Australians, who will topple South Africa from top spot in the ODI table if they beat India 4-1.
The cricketer turned commentator also praised Virat Kohlis fearless captaincy that has helped India dominate with their aggressive approach.
India not only regained their number one Test spot under Kohli last year but recently blanked hosts Sri Lanka 9-0 across all three formats. I think this team has certainly got that aggression in them... they are led by an aggressive captain. Seems to me that Virat is not scared to lose and thats a great advantage, said Clarke.
Indian batting great VVS Laxman, who was also present at the event, said he did not foresee any controversy in the ODI series.
In the Test series Kohli had expressed his displeasure after Smith looked up to his dressing room while deciding whether to review his lbw dismissal in the Bangalore match, and a war of words erupted between the two captains. They are not only two modern-day captains but two modern-day greats. In such a short span of time the impact these two players have had on international cricket is just amazing, said Laxman, who made a match-winning 281 against Australia in the epic 2001 Kolkata Test. And I think when you are playing international cricket its not necessary to be friendly on field... I am sure both will go all out and be aggressive and win the matches for their team... They are both trendsetters according to me, he said.
Laxman picked India to win with a 4-1 scoreline. AFP

AVIC powers Investor Forum 2017 as Gold Sponsor
AVIC International Holding Corporation, a subsidiary of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and a Global 500 Company was proudly acknowledged as part of an influential initiative, Investor Forum 2017, which took place on August 30, at The Kingsbury Hotel, Colombo.

AVIC representatives took part in the proceedings which included the distinguished attendance of over 300 potential local and foreign investors, high net worth individuals or HNWIs, high end developers, property and real estate exhibitors and major shareholders from CSE listed companies to name a few.
The event proved itself as an ideal platform for the right audience to interact and network among themselves.
The concept for an event of this calibre was mainly envisioned when there was clear demand from investors in seeking dialogue and information about the local market as well as interest from exhibitors who had taken part at previous events such as the Lanka Property Show which took place earlier this year.
The core of the event was to emphasize on the volume of investment opportunities in the real estate market in Sri Lanka, create awareness amongst the attendees and provide them with an opportunity to capitalize on the networks that would be formed here.
The Forums agenda included speeches, presentations and panel discussions which assimilated with cocktails and fellowship.
Not only this but the Forum also proved vital as the ideal hub in which to create network opportunities with local and international media, brand promotions, brand equity enhancement and client base expansion.
The Forum also paved way for a number of distinguished speakers and panelists such as CSE Chairman Ray Abeywardena, former Union Bank Chairman Alex Lovell, JLL Head of Transactions Sunil Subramanian and Access Engineering MD Christopher Joshua to meet under one roof and exchange knowhow.
During the course of the event, many of the speakers emphasized on relative subjects that were relevant to the progress of the real estate market in Sri Lanka. Many of the topics also leveraged on matters such as investment opportunities in Sri Lanka as well as focus on vacation investments and a panel discussion which forayed into strategies ideal for bringing investment into the country.
AVIC Astoria Project Director Zhang Bo was also amongst the speakers on this evening and his presentation turned into an ideal opportunity to propel AVIC Astorias status as an investment opportunity for those who were looking for prospects in the real estate and luxury living angle.
The Forum culminated with a vote of thanks presented by RB Realtors CEO Richard Buultjens which was then followed by cocktails and networking.
In Sri Lanka, for the past several years, AVIC has covered hundreds of kilometres worth of road construction projects spread over the country and amongst these include the construction of the A9 road and a number of other influential projects such as the runway overlay and associated works at BIA.
AVIC is a Chinese state-owned company managed by the Government of China. The company not only specializes in the construction of high-rise buildings but has also been instrumental in the implementation of various high-profile projects related to urban infrastructure in China and around the world.

Broadband usage very high among Sri Lankan medium, large enterprises
The use of broadband among the Sri Lankan medium and large enterprise segment is very high, said Therica Miyannadeniya, Director of Emerging Vertical and Qualitative Research, Nielsen Sri Lanka.
This was disclosed with the presentation of the Sri Lanka Broadband Survey Report at the Broadband Forum held yesterday in Colombo.
Online purchasing in Sri Lanka was very low which mainly focused on personal accessories and electronic accessories across age groups. However, older age group was engaged with more touch points such as channeling, groceries, airline ticking and household products.
The usage of broadband services among employees of larger enterprises has been equally high on for both primary and secondary business functions it further revealed. This high usage runs across different types of broadband connections such as 4G/LTE, leased line, mobile data, dongle, fiber line and ADSL.
Here the report recommended that more opportunities made available for customized packages and bundled offerings to cater to the high demand for different types of connections and devices. There was also a opportunity to create awareness and drive cloud based services.
Miyannadeniya said although most of the small enterprises use broadband services, the percentage of employees using broadband within the organization was not high. The majority use broadband for their primary business functions such as sales and marketing, logistics and operations with 4G/LTE connections and ADSL being the main type of broadband connection used. It was revealed that about a fifth of small enterprises consider using a different type of connection mainly 4 G/LTE connections in the next one year.
It was thus recommended that small enterprises should consider upgrading to more advanced connectivity offerings like lease lines and fiber connections.
The survey further revealed that broadband usage was high for data through smart phone, which consisted of 86 percent especially among the younger generation while ADSL and 4G, LTE connection were aligned with the older age group.
The report recommended that affordable smart phones should be made available for the younger age group and increases the scope for 4 G/LTE connections among the older age group.
Miyannadeniya said the main data usage has been for browsing the internet and social networking apps. This is relatively higher among the younger age group while the need to connect internationally is higher among older age groups.
* Over 95% access internet in Sri Lanka using smart phones, 23% with laptops and 11 from desktops
* Majority of users say they have no issues with broadband and about 30% complained about low speed
* Nearly 16% Lankans are constantly connected to internet
* Only 13% Lankans make purchase through internet

Colombo Engineering installs anchor whilst ship afloat
The MSC FILOMENA operated by Peter Dohle Schiffahrts KG of Germany had lost one of its anchors in the high seas and a replacement was urgently needed.
The Principals of the Vessel immediately contacted Kiran Atapattu at Colombo Engineering and thereafter the replacement anchor was shipped out from Singapore.
On arrival of the Vessel to the Colombo Port, professional ship repair teams of Colombo Engineering lost no time but swept into action taking the new anchor in a floating craft alongside, lowering the anchor chain to the floating craft and connecting up the new anchor and heaving it up in place.
"Speedy response backed up by professional afloat ship repair technology promotes a very large image to the International Shipping Markets that Sri Lanka has the facilities and infrastructure to keep in par with any International port in the world," said the Flamboyant Kiran Atapattu.
MSC is represented in Sri Lanka by MSC Lanka (Pvt) Limited and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority also gave its fullest support for this operation.

Colombo Fraud Investigation Bureau questions Bandula
MP Bandula Gunawardena has been questioned by the Colombo Fraud Investigation Bureau over his comments regarding the sale of fake lottery tickets.
The officers of the Bureau had visited the MPs home in Colombo yesterday to record a statement.
According to the Police, the National Lotteries Board had complained to the IGP to investigate into the statements made by the MP over the lottery tickets.
The Police had informed Gunawardena to report to their offices in Borella, but as the MP had failed to show up, the Bureau had paid a visit to his house.
In early July, the Bureau had filed a B report in the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court against the Colombo District MP for claiming at a press conference that there are fake lottery tickets in circulation being sold by agents of the National Lotteries Board.
The Fort Magistrate issued an order directing several television channels that unedited video footage pertaining to the concerned press conference be handed over to the CFIB in order to conduct further investigations.

Committee demands justice for prisoners
The committee for protecting rights of prisoners staged a demonstration yesterday in front of Welikada Prison to stress the government on protecting the rights of the prisoners and to immediately enforce the law against those involved in the Welikada prison shooting in 2012.
They said that the government has failed to implement the law for five years since the shooting at the prison which killed 27 inmates.
Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Minister D.M. Swaminathan said action has already been taken to address prisoners issues.
Swaminathan said that he intends to seek a solution to all these problems in two months time.
The issues pointed out by the committee cannot be solved in one night. This involves decisions and measures taken by former prison affairs ministers therefore measures have been already taken to address them, he said.
Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake who was present at the demonstration emphasized that the government should immediately address the issues pointed out by the Committee for protecting rights of prisoners. He said that not all prisoners are treated equally under the law.
The doctors in the prison hospital are corrupt. Only politicians and political supporters who get arrested are diagnosed with different types diseases and that does not happen to the other prisoners who get arrested for petty reasons. When the government is taking measures to send all the people involved in fraud and corruption under the former and present government to the prison, the doctors at the prison are saving them, he said.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake said that the government also should bring the murderers involved in the Welikada shooting before courts and they should be punished.
Samson Alwis from Borella a demonstrators whos son was killed in the shooting at the prison in 2012, requested the government to take immediate action against the people involved in the shooting.
My son was falsely arrested and the police said that he was selling drugs which he never did. Today everyone knows who carried out the shooting. I request the government to punish the murderers as soon as possible and ensure justice, he said.
Alwis further said that the government is trying to cover up the whole issue by giving compensation to the parents.

Constitution clearly interprets public servant: Herath
Former President must read 19th Amendment The 19th amendment to the Constitution clearly interprets the term public servant. We request former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to read the 19th Amendment. It says the Secretary to the President is a public servant, JVP Publicity Secretary, Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath said.
Herath was addressing a press conference held at the JVP Headquarters in Battaramulla yestreday.
Even prior to passing the 19th Amendment, the Secretary to the President had no power to infringe the Constitution. The Secretary to the President cannot infringe international law either. He should act according to written law. As such, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his followers cannot escape from the wrongdoing of bribery by hanging on to the Constitution, he said.
Herath said the bone of contention was not whether Lalith Weeratunga was a rogue according to the Constitution. If they said Lalith Weeratunga was not a public servant, can he withdraw Rs. 600 million from the TRC and distribute Sil Redi as a normal citizen. If this exercise was a government policy as claimed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, it should have been included in the budget. But its proposals did not include such a thing.
If not, this project should have been included in the action plan tabled by the TRC for the relevant years. But it was proved in court that the Sil Redi distribution project was not included as a proposal in any of these documents. This was a clear misappropriation of public funds. After the court verdict was given, Mahinda Rajapaksa said he would take responsibility to it. But he never took responsibility while the judicial process was underway. Therefore, it was clearly evident that Mahinda Rajapaksa and Lalith Weeratunga implemented this exercise according to a plan.

Dengue dare
Lately, in the Sri Lanka media appeared a sundry of articles and reports about the menace of dengue and the fight against it. In the article War against dengue in the Daily News edition of July 24, it was reported that from the beginning of this month thousands of soldiers, airmen and sailors (maybe marines) have supported the Public Health Inspectors in a house-to-house campaign to identify mosquito breeding areas and take corrective measures. Mostly it happens in Colombo and some Western Province areas, where the inhabitants, due to a dense population, are exposed to a dengue danger.
I live in Kochchikade (Negombo) and, alas, I have never seen a single attempt to identify mosquito breeding places in my location- no officials of local authorities, supported by police and armed forces, have visited my or neighboring premises, although there were many people in the area affected by the dengue malady. Somebody spread the rumours that all households would be inspected on Wednesday, (July 12) and in case a mosquito breeding place would be found, the owners of the premises would be liable to pay SLR 50.000,000.
Apparently, it was a ruse or fake news, as no official turned up but, anyway, it had a positive effect, as everybody tried to clean their surroundings by making incriminate massive fires and burning all accumulated rubbish, plastic items included. In this endeavour, the house owners erroneously hoped to drive away mosquitoes away but it was a futile attempt, as the buzzing creatures after a while descended in numerous numbers upon them again.
Fogging device
A couple of days later, I was intrigued by a loud noise and plume of smoke that emanated from the road nearby. The cats and dogs, frightened by the noise, scurried to find a safe hiding place, the people hastened to close their doors and windows. I went outside the gate to see what was happening. The thundering sound grew louder and from the cloud of smoke, like in one of those Doomsday films (Apocalypse now), appeared a ghastly figure with a mask and a menacing looking fogging device.
The fumigator-exterminator (my own coinage) told me to go inside my house and close the door. I obeyed but later on I wanted to find out whether that fogging had any effect on the mosquito population and opened the door. After a half an hour or so, (around six oclock p.m.) the first mosquitoes flew into the house and I managed to kill them with an electric mosquito swatter. Next morning, as I usually sleep with an open window under a mosquito net, I found and killed some 30 more of them.
I became curious about fogging and its effects on mosquitoes, human beings and fauna. I started my research on the Internet and found some interesting and relevant articles, features. Daily Mail in its article of September 22, 2016, wrote about fogging and its effects in India. It reported that fogging machines used by the municipal corporations in Delhi spray 95 litres of diesel mixed with insecticides in an hour.
The chemical used for fumigation is mostly malathion which can be hazardous for humans- especially for the vulnerable, young and elderly. It can cause short term breathing problems, headaches in healthy people and can have chronic long term effects. Dr. S.P. Byotra, senior consultant and chairman of medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said: It has an adverse effect on those, who are asthmatic and allergic. Fumigation is no more effective but has a negative impact on human health. World Health Organization (WHO) warns against needless fumigation.
It reiterates that anti-mosquito fogging is 95% diesel mixed with only 5% of chemicals, like pyrethrum, malathion and alphacypher.
Diesel is a Class-I cancer causing element. Fumigation is not a preventive measure but only a containment measure. It is a high-risk formula with only psychological effects- it makes people feel safer. There is data which suggests that mosquitoes have become resistant to the chemicals used in fumigation and may not die. Furthermore, fogging kills other insects that feed on mosquitoes.
Seek foreign help
Dengue has to be controlled at the larval stage. Former South Delhi mayor, Subhash Arya, said that fogging is mostly done outside the houses, which can be effective only for some 5-10 minutes and then it gets mixed in the air and, hence, there will be no impact on the mosquitoes. The doctors also warn about the serious health implications to humans in the pesticide drive.
It is commendable that Sri Lankan government decided to seek foreign help in fight against dengue and is ready to introduce a new method to reign in dengue menace by spreading bacteria which are harmful to mosquitoes. Many Sri Lankans, especially uneducated ones, entertain a belief that burning rubbish, including plastics, can deter mosquitoes.
This is an illusion and therefore, the media, governmental bodies, schools and other public institutions should educate the populace about the menace of burning plastic items in their gardens. This education should start at the school level so that the children could warn their parents about this danger and be able to tell- mummy, please, do not burn these plastic cups and bags, as they poison us. It is indisputably proven that burning plastics emits carcinogenic, toxic smoke and causes Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and cancer.
There are over a million people in Sri Lanka, who suffer from asthma. From my own experience, in the early morning hours I can hear the people after awakening sneezing and coughing, as they try to cleanse their lungs and sinuses, affected by smoke from their hearths and fires outside. The toxic elements after the rain penetrate into the ground-water and cause a great health hazard in long term, as many people use water from the tube and open wells. It seems that now, in the face of dengue menace, nearly everybody thinks that he/she has a right to burn toxic garbage, disregarding hazards to their own and other peoples health. Is it a license to kill anything and anybody

Ensuring stability
UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, apparently, has had enough. He has virtually read the riot act on the dissidents within the SLFP in the Unity Government. Many SLFP ministers, deputies and state ministers have, in recent times, threatened to quit the government. Minister Amaraweera has now broken his silence vis-a-vis the dissidents and has chosen to call their bluff.
All along, it has been the UNP MPs who had been griping against their SLFP counterparts in the government for speaking out of turn. They even went to the extent of summoning media conferences to demand that the garrulous MPs of the SLFP who criticized the UNP, and its leader, should leave the Unity Government. They (SLFP MPs), they contended, cannot have the best of the both worlds, meaning, remaining in the government and criticizing it's main constituent and thus making overtures to the Joint Opposition. Matters came to head that, both, the President and Prime Minister, had to intervene to settle things.
However, things have now taken a turn for the worse, with senior SLFPers holding top ministerial office, not stopping at criticizing the UNP, but also taking issue with the government, as a whole. In other words, they have also started being critical of the SLFP component of the Unity Government and by extension, the President, who is the Chairman of the party. What is more, they do so while still enjoying the perks of office.
Hence, it is only natural that the day of reckoning must arrive, sooner or later. Minister Amaraweera has requested these fence sitters in no uncertain terms, that they should leave the government, instead of criticizing it, while remaining in it's fold. He has also reminded them as to what would have become of their fate had the UNP gone for an election soon after the President's victory on January 8. Would they have had the opportunity to become ministers On the other hand, the UNP held the majority in parliament and it would have been a simple matter for the PM to engineer a few crossovers and form a UNP government. Where would they have been in such an eventuality
The minister was incensed that the SLFP ministers were criticizing government policy and the efforts taken to overcome the massive debt inherited by the regime. You cannot have it both ways. Toe the line or quit, the minister seems to be telling the rebels. He said: Not only President Sirisena, but many SLFP ministers have admitted that if the UNP went for an immediate general election, they would have secured a majority in parliament, easily. Therefore, it is high time that all those who criticize and insult government policies must either put a stop to them or resign immediately from the SLFP and their portfolios and join the JO, because their behaviour is extremely unethical, shameless and treacherous.
The SLFP rebels in the government fold have for a long time openly expressed their unease at remaining in the government, apparently for the consumption of their support base. It must not be forgotten that these ministers and MPs rode on the back of the Mahinda wave, to enter parliament and are obviously making noises to avoid incurring the wrath of their supporters. Not just these rebels, but it is true of all SLFP MPs in the present parliament. The hostile reception received by some SLFP MPs who dared criticize Rajapaksa, at public events, in recent times, certainly had influenced these rebels to buy insurance for their future survival, by expressing sentiments that are in accord with Mahida Rajapaksa and the JO. Their open criticism of the Hambantota port agreement and the Trincomalee oil tank issue are based on this thinking.
At the same time, they are also aware that they will be cast adrift, rudderless, if they leave the government, and with it, their portfolios. For, they will be out in the cold for another three years (when the next election is due) sans ministerial perks, privileges and the trappings of power. Hence, their procrastination, instead of taking the plunge. Some of these ministers and MPs say they are planning to quit, after the budget. Is it their case that they will not leave the government if the budget is a people friendly one
Be that as it may, these SLFP elements in the Unity Government cannot be allowed to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. Disciplinary action is called for against them, rather than a mere demand to quit. Stability is vital for the smooth functioning of a government, and, attempts to throw a spanner in the works should be dealt with firmly. Investors may shy away when they spot a regime that is shaky. Besides, a Cabinet that is at variance on government policy can only lead to destability, with ministers working at cross purposes.
Those making dissenting noises, therefore, should be shown where to get off. If certain SLFP ministers are uncomfortable with remaining in the government, they should be told, in no uncertain terms, that they are welcome to quit.

First-ever Lankan drone takes flight
Over the past decade, the development of drones has been on the rise worldwide. Hailed as the technology of the future, drones, or UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), are being used for a wide array of purposes  military operations, delivery of goods, surveillance of lands below. Rather than waiting for this technology to arrive in Sri Lanka, and at a marked up price, a group of students of the University of Moratuwas Drone Development Program have created their own drones that are 100% locally designed, manufactured, and driven in Sri Lanka.
Prof. Rohan Munasinghe
At the first-ever drone symposium in Sri Lanka, held at SLIDA in late August, the details of this venture were expounded upon. The symposium was hosted jointly by the Universitys Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering and Future Drones (PVT) Ltd, which is the first spin-off company to result from the Universitys own startup incubator. It will be responsible for further production and distribution of the drones. On display at the event were three of the companys drone models.
Speaking at the symposium, Professor Rohan Munasinghe of the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, who is called the backbone of UAV development in the entire country, spoke about the progression of the development of local drone technology.
He called its advent within the country disruptive, and said that, contrary to popular belief, such technology is coming our way and, in a way, is already here.
We as the scientific and engineering community of this country have to welcome this technology, and use it to make our lives easier, to make the things that we do on a daily basis, in technical fields and in engineering fields more efficient, more accurate, Munasinghe said.
History of local drone development
Using a slideshow presentation, Munasinghe went through a brief history of Sri Lankan drone technology, proclaiming that though it has come a long way, it can go further.
The first attempt at bringing drone technology to Sri Lanka was in 2004 or 2005, said Munasinghe. But the developments were unsuccessful, due to a variety of factors including inadequate performance of the drones electronic components, lack of programming support, and inaccessibility of electronic and communication devices, sensors, and actuators. By 2007, the first drone at Moratuwa was built, but despite testing it didnt take off the ground.
The year 2011 marked the first successful quadrotor (four-rotored) drone project; this one took off the ground with some basic controlsthe beginning of a new era in drone innovation in Sri Lanka. The next big progression was the incorporation of autopilot setting, giving the drone a brain of sorts rather than forcing it to rely solely on human control at every step. Deployed on a drone plane flight here for the first time in 2012, the autopilot development was a crucial one that marked the Moratuwa drones entry into a far more sophisticated class of UAVs. But as Munasinghe explained, not everyone understood the significance of this flight.
At that time when we were doing this, a lot of people sent us appreciations. But sometimes people asked us, Why do you want to do this Its a $30 thing on ebay. But they were just looking at the physical plane, the rigifoam piece. They didnt know what was going on inside. So we did not respond to any of these people, other than to tell them to sit down and wait. Because if you have the autopilot technology down, you can put it on any drone.
In the years since, this autopilot technology has been used on almost all of the University of Moratuwas drones, which have been increasingly progressing in their levels of sophistication and in their capabilities. The success of the drone technology led to the creation of Future Drones (PVT) Ltd. out of the Universitys very own start-up incubator, or project accelerator, called Vibhava. The company is now working to mass produce, market, and distribute the drones with multiple different organizations and corporations who will use such technology for an array of purposes.
Drones lead the way
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka, an engineer by training himself, was the symposiums Chief Guest. Ranawaka said that the developments in drone technology represent highly encouraging efforts by the engineering and technology community of the country to get onto the bandwagon of high-tech innovation, which the government believes is the way forward toward achieving various economic development goals.
This represents the adaption of Sri Lanka, at least for the first time at the University of Moratuwa, of a new breed of enterprises that have been tried, tested, and proven in a technologically advanced nation as a vital element of the technological development ecosystem, Ranawake said. It is also significant that this innovative step has been taken in an exciting area of technology: drones.
He emphasized that these drones will help the country not just militarily, but also in the future for non-military applications such as disaster management. Had this advanced technology been in wider use in the past, he explained, tragic outcomes could have been lessened or avoided.
When the Meethotamulla disaster occurred, Dr. Manju Gunawardana used the same technology to map out the entire Meethotamulla garbage dump. If we could have done this earlier, I think we would have been able to save many lives.
What comes next
Ongoing drone projects currently in development include ones to enhance large scale mapping of the country and its regions, a precision agriculture drone to help rural farmers in the country, and even a dengue prevention drone that will be able to fly above elevated, hard-to-access areas and determine whether still water exists there and can act as a breeding ground for mosquito larvae. Future drone projects include Ceybeetle, in collaboration with Dialog, a drone that would be able to monitor telephone towers; Ceyhex, a drone that would deliver blood samples to hospitals, since the aerial route from the National Blood Bank to the hospitals is much faster than the ground route; a Telepresence Drone for disaster management, that would be able to both aid in search-and-rescue efforts as well as deliver necessary goods such as clean water; and a surveillance drone for security purposes.
A lot of people say that this type of development mainly happens in developed countries, and not in countries like ours, said a student at the University of Moratuwa and member of the Drone Development Program. But Im really proud to say as a Sri Lankan, that we are taking on the technology of drones and building things that can compete with the entire world.

Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa can be taken to courts: Rajitha Senaratne

Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Rajitha Senaratne said today that the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa can be taken to courts over his admission to having given the order to distribute Sil Cloth to voters during the previous Presidential election campaign.
The former President and current Kurunegala MP who visited his former Secretary, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita in Welikada Prison, said the two were punished for having followed his orders.
Weeratunga and the former Director General of the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC), Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 650 million of state funds during the re-election campaign of Rajapaksa.
They were each sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
Minister Senaratne however pointed out that Rajapaksas statement came in a little too late.
He should have made the statement earlier when the case was taken up in the past 24 days, not after visiting Welikada, he said, addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing held today.
But this statement comes at a time when the 19thAmendment to the Constitution removed the Executives immunity under the law which states that all former and incumbent Presidents are liable for prosecution in a court of law.
He can even face contempt of court charges for questioning the verdict, added Senaratne.

Gathered in One Place
The Worlds Most Beautiful Bookstores:
The first thing I noticed upon entering Livraria Lello in Porto, Portugal was its famed staircase. Curvy and red, it rises from the floor as if by magic. Word has it that J.K. Rowling herself was inspired by it when creating the world of Harry Potter and the magical library at Hogwarts. Its no wonder Livraria Lello has made countless lists of the most beautiful bookstores in the world. I realized that at that moment, I was the person I often dreada bookstore tourist. The bookstore I run in downtown Los Angeles, the Last Bookstore, is also a tourist destination and photo opportunity, as well as a neighborhood bookstore.
But I was here to learn.
Many months before, I received an email from the staff at Livraria Lello asking about my interest in forming a group of the worlds most beautiful bookstores. As a reader and lover of bookstores, I find every bookstore beautiful in its own way, from neatly organized displays to dusty towers of books leaning precipitously in used bookstores, but a handful of us around the world keep ending up on press lists of beautiful bookstores. I said yes, curious about what the bookstores who appear on those lists could have to say to each other. Then, in the early spring, I was invited to attend a gathering in Porto.
Even though Livraria Lello extended the invitation to bookstores around the world, only those in North America and Europe agreed to attend. The other bookstores rounding out the list of attendees were Barts Books in Ojai, California, Daunt Books in London, Shakespeare & Co. in Paris, Cook and Book in Brussels, Boekhandel Dominicanen in Maastrict, Netherlands, Libreria Acqua Alta in Venice, and Atlantis Books in Oia, Santoriniand of course, our hosts Livraria Lello.
I love gatherings of booksellers and eagerly attend my regional trade conference and the larger conferences when Im able. The chance to attend an international gathering was especially exciting. It seemed to me those invited would have similar experiences about how to balance being a neighborhood bookstore as well as a place for photographs, so I looked forward to talking about how other stores had handled their beautiful status. Livraria Lello, I learned, has a creative solution to that problem. They charge admission to their store, and the ticket price is applied toward the purchase of any merchandise a visitor buys. Other bookstores, like Shakespeare and Co., dont allow photography at all. The ability to discuss those decisions with the bookstores who had implemented them was one of the great opportunities of the gathering.
As soon as the booksellers gathered together the first night, we began discussing our bookstores with their unique challenges and rewards. All of us in attendance love selling books, as became abundantly clear. We also faced challenges that arose not only from having heavily tourist-based sales, but from the changing trends in bookselling.
The next morning, we gathered at Livraria Lello to kick off their World Book Day festivities. The Portuguese ministers of Culture and Education joined us to talk about literature and Livraria Lello. It was a thrill to have our gathering deemed so important not only by the people of Livraria Lello, but also to have the role of a bookstore esteemed so much by the leadership of Portugal.
Each bookstore, I learned, shelves its books and uses its space in different ways. The variety of ways in which each store functions opened my eyes to the ways in which readers relate to their neighborhood stores.
Daunt Books, for example, arranges books by country, which makes a wonderful kind of logic. Fiction and nonfiction both are arranged by locale. As someone who loves literary tourism, it seems like the perfect way to lay out a store for those who want to read about the places they intend to visit.
Cook and Book in Brussels takes the idea of a bookstore caf one better by having their entire store function as both restaurant and bookstore. Each room of the shop features a genre of books as well as dining space. I could picture diners accidentally bumping into shoppers as they slide out from the tables, but they manage in such a way that allows them to rely, and profit, on revenue from both sources.

Gender equality pivotal to achieving sustainable development: UN ESCAP report
The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) recently released the first report to comprehensively map out the intersections between gender and environment at the levels of household, work, community and policy in Asia-Pacific.
Launched by United Nations Under-Secretary General and Executive Secretary of ESCAP Dr. Shamshad Akhtar during the first Asia-Pacific Ministerial Summit on the Environment in Bangkok, the report identifies key policy interventions by examining gender concerns in the spheres of food security, agriculture, energy, water, fisheries and forestry.
The momentum set forth by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development provides a historic opportunity for reducing inequality and closing gender gaps, said Dr. Akhtar.
"In Asia and the Pacific, the lives of a sizeable proportion of women are inextricably tied to the use of environment for daily support and livelihood.
For sustainable development to become a reality in the region, it is incumbent on policymakers to address the pivotal linkages between gender and the environment.
In line with the Regional Road Map for Implementing the 2030 Agenda, adopted earlier this year, the report entitled Gender, the Environment and Sustainable Development in Asia and the Pacific, provides a body of analysis for member states to ensure the integration of gender equality and womens empowerment as central issues in their environmental and sustainable development policy agenda.
Key findings show that most economically active women are in the agriculture sector, yet less than 20 per cent of women hold secure tenure to the lands they farm.
Furthermore, structural factors have restricted their access to credit, mechanical equipment, irrigation facilities and extension services, which in turn has a negative effect on agricultural productivity.
If women had access to and control of the same resources as men, their contributions would increase food production by 2.5 to 4 per cent, which would be enough to move 150 million people out of hunger and poverty across the developing world.
The report also shows that 66 per cent of workers in large-scale marine fisheries are women but their work, more often than not, remains formally unrecognized as official data tends to focus on male bastions such as open-ocean and river fishing, ignoring activities such as post-harvest processing and net-making. ESCAP highlights the need for policymakers to track the entire fishing cycle from start to finish, to make this 'invisible work' done by women visible.
The Asia-Pacific region today has at least 455 million people who lack access to electricity and more than 2 billion people still relying on biomass, or solid fuel, for cooking.
The report underlines that clean energy has transformative potential to enhance productivity, relieve the burden of housework, and improve womens health, as household air pollution is the second-biggest health risk factor for women and children globally.
Key policy recommendations include adopting gender mainstreaming as a mechanism to enact gender-sensitive policies and interventions, conducting systems mapping within and across sectors to address gender concerns and adopting gender budgeting to establish gender-sensitive financing goals, processes and mechanisms.
Country-specific evidence in this report reinforces fostering womens effective participation and leadership in the management of environmental resources will positively influence conservation and resource efficiency.

GMOAs token strike in six districts
The token strike launched by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday in protest of not offering a people friendly solution to the SAITM issue, will continue today in six districts, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing the media at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the token strike will take place in state hospitals in Vavuniya, Matale, Anuradhapura, Badulla, Monaragala and Matara districts today.
The token strike will hit five more districts tomorrow, he said.
GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said the government is not declaring the solution for the SAITM issue.
Public servants should be careful when following orders of politicians because they will be imprisoned if they break law and support them. It is questionable how one politician got so much of power to pump millions of rupees to the Dr. Nevil Fernando Hospital, Ananda said.

## Supertitle:

Hurricane Jose's strange path may bring it back toward the Bahamas and US

First Harvey, then Irma and now ... Jose
Hurricane Jose was 700 miles east of Floridaat midday Tuesday, with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, making it a Category 1 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.
The storm is expected to remain at hurricane intensity in the Western Atlantic, and it could strengthen as it takes an odd, looping path that may bring it near the Bahamas and the United States this weekend.
However, most computer models indicate Jose will stay out to sea and complete a tight enough loop to avoid moving onshore.
Jose's impact is sure to be felt along the Southeast coast, bringing rough seas.
Such a path is concerning in the wake of Hurricane Irma, which has altered the beach landscape and made it more vulnerable to coastal erosion and flooding.
The track for Hurricane Jose is a strange one.
In a pocket of weak steering winds in the open Atlantic, Jose is expected to make a clockwise loop. It will initially move farther away from the United States before coming closer to the Bahamas and East Coast.
A westward motion is the result of a ridge of high pressure to the north and then east of the storm. The strength and location of this ridge will determine how far Jose moves westward before eventually turning north and then east again.
Two of the most robust computer models meteorologists use to determine the odds of landfall GFS, the American forecast model, and theECMWF, the European onekeep Jose over the ocean.
But models can have trouble forecasting unusual tracks such as Jose's expected path. There is generally not a dominant weather feature that is steering the storm, so model forecasts can vary widely between each other and from run to run.
The National Hurricane Center recognizes this uncertainty in its Tuesday morning forecasts for Jose, saying "after (three days), the confidence in the forecast decreases as the guidance diverges significantly."
The center's official forecast finds Jose just over 400 miles from Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday morning. Still, the cone of uncertainty comes uncomfortably close, within 200 miles of Florida and 50 miles from the Bahamas.
The storm may bring a high risk of rip currents, too.
Jose already has threatened other hurricane-weary countries. As a much stronger Category 4 storm,the hurricane passed only 85 milesfrom the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda last weekend.
Tropical storm-force winds from Jose spread over the islands on Saturday. Only three days earlier, Antigua and Barbuda had been devastated by a peak-strength Category 5 Irma, packing 185-mph winds.
Hurricane season still ongoing
Before this hurricane season, the United States had gone arecord 12 years without a major hurricane landfall. But with Harvey and Irma, it has now experienced two Category 4 landfalls in 16 days.
In May, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said that unseasonably warm ocean temperatures and a no-show from El Nio would contribute to apotentially "extremely active" hurricane season.
There have already been six named hurricanes this season:Franklin, Gert, Harvey, Irma, Jose and Katia. If history is a guide, more will be on the way.
The full hurricane season lasts until November 30, although the peak season generally stretches from about mid-August to mid-October. But hurricanes into November and even December are not unheard of. Last year, Hurricane Otto formed on November 20 andmade landfall in Nicaraguaas a Category 2 storm.

Increase in number of students for Law College proposed
The Policy Development Office of the Prime Ministers Office has put forward a set of proposals to increase the number of students accessing legal education.
The proposals come in the light of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) requesting that the Office look into ways to increase the number of qualified lawyers in the country.
A study into the subject conducted by the Office had shown that high cut off marks for the internal LLB degree at State universities have limited the opportunities available for legal education at the Sri Lanka Law College .
In 2016, 8,432 students have missed the opportunity to enter state universities to get their LL.B degrees due to high cut off marks. In the same year, of 5135 students applied to the Sri Lanka Law College, only 239 were selected.
The Office has proposed that strong District Bar Associations open up opportunities for practitioners to be teachers at a Law College in the district with universities nearby providing the necessary academic support. In addition they also suggested:
Conducting of entrance examinations under the supervision of Commissioner General of Examination and Council of Legal Education, as of now, and other internal exams conducted by the Council of Legal Education, as of now, have been identified as a sensible method of quality control.
Successful students can indicate their choice of the Colombo or a district law college and will be selected on a competitive merit plus residential basis. The Law College of the Council Legal Education is a fee charging institute, and this expansion will not be a strain on the state coffers.
Admission to the Bar would remain a matter for the Supreme Court. The Office believed that the proposals would open up opportunities for youth to access legal education.

Inland Revenue Act to equally net professionals
The Sri Lankan tax structure would be simplified under the new Inland Revenue Act said Thanuja Perera consultant to Sri Lankas Finance Ministry.
She was speaking at a seminar organized by National Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka yesterday. Perera said that under the new act professionals too would be taxed equally.
Sri Lanka will tax foreign currency deposits in the future in the same manner as rupee deposits through a new income tax law that will come into effect next year, she added.
Perera said under the new law, a withholding tax of 5 percent will be deducted by banks as a final tax, up from 2.5 percent. Companies will be liable at 5 percent, but it will not be the final tax and will form part of the taxable income.
Ivan Dissanayake Director General Inland Revenue said with online and RAMIS to be implemented the new tax structure would be also user friendly. It would come in to effect from April 1, 2018.
Sri Lankas primary dealers in government securities will be taxed at 28% under a new income tax law that will come into effect, said Sulaiman Nishtar, Partner at Ernst and Young.
Primary dealers in government securities borrow short term money and invest in longer term bonds at higher rates earning. Under a new Inland Revenue law capital gains are taxed at 10 percent and interest income at 28 percent for companies.
Non-resident foreign currency accounts were exempted from tax as an incentive not to keep dollars earned abroad in foreign banks.
Foreign currency earnings from services provided by individuals or partnerships up to 15 million rupees will be exempt, protecting most guest workers. Currently, all such income is exempted said Partner, Ernst and Young. Duminda Hulangamuwa
Income from dollar-denominated Sri Lanka Development Bonds will also be taxed. He said it was necessary to bring in a new Inland Revenue act to broaden the tax net.

JAIL BIRD
Mahesh came home in a hurry, put on his rain coat, took a small bag and went away. He kick- started his motor bike and soon was out of the village. His accomplice was on the ready at the Horagampita junction and jumped onto the pillion. Very soon, the duo was out of sight and Wimala, his beloved wife was waiting impatiently for her husband and their children Suba, Maya, Rita and the three sons Vibhutha, Vidhusha and Kalingu were fast asleep.
The time was sharp one at night; Wimala fell asleep on the rickety couch in the small living room. It was dead at night. Wimala was in slumber when she heard some men or animals encircling their house. Their house was at the edge of the jungle and so she ignored the sounds for a while. She woke up with trembling limbs.
A knock on the door; she took the knife to her hand and slowly approached the rear door. It was quite palpable to her that police had surrounded their house. Mahesh had strictly told her not to open the door to any one in his absence. She kept silent. She kept vigil for some time and the frightful sounds stopped. She went back to sleep and on her waking up she found a huge sack full of chicken meat. It was hidden in the back yard by Mahesh and their children were herded to their schools on two rides on his bicycle.
Mahesh was waiting for about half an hour and a white van came. He put on his immaculately white long sleeved shirt and drove away with the last night theft in the boot. A new couple had tied their nuptial knots on the altar of purity and their guests appeased their taste buds on the sacrifice of the poor chickens for the education of Maheshs children. Irony is dramatic.
Mahesh and Wimala left no stone unturned to make their lost hopes realized in childrens education. Mahesh was only two marks short of university admission. His father was a municipal worker and mother; a basket woman who carried vegetables on her head from door to door in the city of Galle. Wimala hails from a well to do family, but her insistence to marry Mahesh made her a family outcast. She inherited nothing from her parents and they turned a blind eye to her on the city streets.
Her numerous requests to her parents to help them fell on deaf ears and they took to their hearts to make their six children shine on the horizon of education one day by hook or crook. Mahesh and Wimala were in the same class when they bid adieu to their alma mater.
The third of the family, Kalingu was a prodigal son and all the others played no second fiddle to anyone in studies. Mahesh and Wimala underwent many a hardship to educate their children and as a dutiful wife Wimala, under any circumstance didnt let their children know how money was earned for their education. They were provided with the best of education, uniforms, tuition and additional reading materials all the time because they were bound by a firm determination to live a contented life one day.
Their homestead was ideal for home gardening and Wimala spent most of her time in it to keep the home fires burning. Their children make it a habit to burn mid night oil to come off with flying colours at their examinations. The garden became very greenish with Wimalas sweat and home expenses were no more a big burden to them. They had rented out the house and the plot from the village money lender and he increased the monthly rent.
The only motivational factor for them was Wimalas parents Cinderella treatment to them as her sisters and brothers were well treated by them. Childrens potentials were high and their gumption to achieve their target knew no bounds. Both Wimala and Mahesh applied for government jobs and desperately failed at their attempts. They genuinely wanted to give up stealing, yet they could not find any way.
During the election time, they filled a bundle of applications to be given jobs immediately after the election, but when they met the winning candidate they were told that they were not in the priority list. Many a night he spent climbing trees to hang cut-outs, but the real job applications had been given to the kith and kin.
One day their eldest son asked from his mother about the way of income of their father. Mother told him their father was a supplier of fresh plantains and meat to the city hotels, wholesale, with the help of a friend who was one of his classmates. She slowly, yet steadily put into the ears of the other children the same notion with common sense.
Mahesh was caught red handed by police while he was transporting fifty kilos of fork, wild boar flesh.
The police prosecuted Mahesh and his accomplice who provided the white van and both were found guilty. Mahesh was sentenced to a prison term of three months, it was rigorous imprisonment while his friend was fined ten thousand rupees or in default of the fine three weeks imprisonment at an open prison camp. His parents paid the fine and took him to their custody.
One day Wimala visited the open prison camp in Hambanthota and to her dismay Mahesh was wearing the prisoners jumper. Tears came down her cheeks, yet she managed to discuss what to do till he returns to support the family. Adding insult to injury, her father had unexpectedly visited Wimala and told her that it was poetic justice. Their eldest son Vibhutha had come of age by that time and asked her mother about fathers long stay.
They were in a common agreement not to divulge the happening to the children. She never breached the promise and the news went round the village that Mahesh was in prison. Wimala thought of the dignity of the growing children and left the area. A distant relation had come to give them a helping hand and Wimala started another minor business. That was making string hoppers and hoppers for the nearby canteens of the large industrial area of Koggala.
She could manage both home and childrens education independently. In the meanwhile, Mahesh was given presidential pardon on good behavior and came home. The eldest son Vibhutha was selected to the medical faculty and the others were doing their studies well.
Their family income was not enough for their growing demands and Mahesh embarked on a very precarious path. It was going with the way of life of the area and he was frequently travelling in luminous cars in good clothes with a tie. Children were very happy as his father was thought to be an executive. Within a very short spell of time he had to appear before the court several time. When he appeared for the fifth time in two years the judge took up the matters seriously.
You have a very notorious history of criminal behavior. You have committed a number of thefts and caught red handed in drug trafficking. Do you have anything to declare to the court The judge inquired perusing through the penalty code.
O your majesty, it is the society that made me a thief. Mahesh quipped without any hesitation as the court had become like his own compound to him now. His eldest son, now a promising medical student fainted in the court precincts as it was very palpable to him how his expenses had been made by his parents. His wife was summoned to the dock as the main accomplice of the case and she said to the court, My husband is a jailbird. All these time I managed to look after our children as a dutiful mother under trying conditions as all the attempts we made to live a righteous life failed. O my majesty we are innocent. It is the society that made us criminals.

Kershaw steers Australia to victory, Sri Lanka claim third win
Though they had lost their opening match, University of Sydney made a resounding surge through the back end of the Red Bull Campus Cricket World Final group stages, and have now locked down the last spot in the semi-final. This was thanks in no small part to the all-round talents of Joseph Kershaw, who hit 27 runs and took 3 for 16 in their victory against Marathwada Mitra Mandal College of Commerce (MMMC College), Pune.
Three teams were in contention for the knockouts berth when the match began, with MMMC College and Jinnah Government College Nazimabad (JGCN), Karachi capable of progressing based on run rates. Sydney, however only needed to win the match to secure their position in the knockouts, and an impressive bowling attack led by Joseph Kershaw delivered them a 22-run win, even though their batsmen had only mustered a total of 136 for 8. Kershaw himself had been the only batsman to clear the boundary in Sydneys innings.
India were faced with having to reach the target of 137 inside 10.4 overs if they were to achieve a sufficient run-rate to qualify for the semis, but quickly lost their entire top order to Sydneys quicks. Their hopes were essentially dashed inside the first three overs, in which they had slipped to 5 for 28.
Meanwhile, at Colts Cricket Club, University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh (ULAB) quicks had sewed up the other semi-final berth, in a crushing win over Herriott Watt University, UAE. Morsalin Mortaza, who had claimed a five-wicket haul on day two, continued his good bowling form, claiming 3 for 11, while Shariful Islam  another right-arm quick  took 3 for 7. Their efforts saw ULAB dismiss Herriott Watt for 82 inside 17 overs. That target would barely stretch the ULAB batting order, which sauntered home with six wickets and 62 balls to spare.
The days biggest wins, however, went to the two strongest teams of the group stages: North West University (NWU), South Africa, and Business Management School, Sri Lanka (BMS). NWU had made a commanding 192 for 7 against JGCN, thanks in part to the rapid 70-run stand produced by their openers, Wihan Lubbe and Janneman Malan. That total always looked steep, but when NWU fast bowler Jean-Piere Le Roux sparked a top order collapse, the match slipped very quickly from JGCNs grasp. They were reduced to 7 for 74 in the 13 th over  Le Roux taking 4 for 12, and JGCN eventually lost by 76 runs.
BMS margin of victory was six wickets, as they brushed aside World Final first-timers National University of Science and Technology (NUST), ZImbabwe. Having dismissed Nust for 108 thanks largely to the work of BMS offspinners Koshan Jayawickrama and Geshan Wimaladharma. With the bat, Thilaksha Sumanasiri blasted two sixes and four fours in an 11-ball innings that yielded 30, while opener Dinuk Wikramanayake produced a more measured innings to finish with 31. They top their group and will now face Australia in the semi-final.

Locally produced anti-venom vaccines by year-end

Locally produced anti-venom (vaccines) for snake bites for five varieties of snakes will be available by the end of this year, Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. J.M.W. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo he said that at the moment anti-venom vaccines for snake bites are imported to Sri Lanka from foreign countries such as India.
"Those vaccines are produced for venom found in snakes that are endemic to their countries. Therefore they are not ideal to treat patients bitten by snakes endemic to Sri Lanka," the doctor said.
According to Dr. Bandara, the locally produced anti venom vaccines will match venom found in local snakes one hundred percent.
Five vaccines will be produced locally for cobra, russells' viper, saw-scaled viper, hump nosed viper and common krait viper bites. The venom of snakes endemic to Sri Lanka will be used to produce the vaccines.
"We will locally produce around 50 varieties of drugs required by next year in order to save money spend to import those costly drugs," he added.

Malay muse
The revised and enlarged edition of Persaudaraan  Malay Life in Sri Lanka by Tuan Zameer Careem (Godage Publishers) was launched at the auditorium of the Sri Lanka College of Surgeons recently. Professor Maithree Wickremesinghe, Tissa Devendra, Prof Karunasena Dias Parnavitana, Venerable Professor Ittademaliya Indasara Nayaka Thera, Netharlands Ambassador Joanne Doorneward, Zahiere Careem and Sabrina Jayah delivered speeches at the occasion.
Tuan M Zameer Careems revised edition is certainly a labour of love and a work of meticuluous details, which is both historical and ethnographical. Specifically focusing on the different life aspects of the diasporic Malays in Sri Lanka, the book will undoubtedly provide many windows to the study of Malays in a comparative context. As an anthropologist researching into Malays in Peninsular Malaysia in the context of their changing cultural values and socio-economic transformation, one can be excited about the possibilities of Zameer Careems book in providing comparative answers to some of the critical questions arising from this particular Malaysian discourse.
For instance, how could we utilize the Malay Sri Lankan ethnographic and historical data base to engage in the counter-narrations against colonial knowledge or the colonial/post- colonial discourse on orientalising the Malays , as has been elegantly argued in S. Hussein Alatass The Myth of the Lazy Native (1977).
Are there concrete markers of high achievement orientations amongst Malay subjects in Sri Lanka as a result of their diasporic environment How relevant is the nature of the debate pertaining to Malay development and underdevelopment in the Sri Lankan context These above questions pertaining to the many facets of being Malay remain critical research issues among scholars of contemporary Malay society in Malaysia.

Milk fish to replace Chinese-imported bait fish
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to promote milk fish (Chanos Chanos), known in Sinhala as Wekkaya, as an alternative for bait fish imported from China.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has directed relevant officials to provide relief for those who are willing to breed this local fish variety as an alternative for the Chinese bait fish variety.
The Minister said that the price of Chinese-imported cuttlefish used as bait has increased rapidly during the past few months.
Though fishermen made a request to reduce the price, the ministry cannot do that as no tax has been imposed on this Chinese bait fish variety, said the minister.
According to that, theministry has decided to provide a financial assistance of Rs. 500,000 and lands for them. Measures have also been taken to provide loans at concessionary rates through a State bank. The Minister said that a land from Balapitiya close to Madu Ganga and another land from Chilaw have already been identified as suitable lands for breeding this bait fish.
The Ministry has also decided to give priority to the fisher community when they select beneficiaries with the intention of enhancing their living standards. said the Minister.

No LG elections this year: Deshapriya
Local Government(LG) Elections will not be held this year according to Chairman of the Elections Commission, Mahinda Deshapriya.
The earliest possible date to hold the Local Government elections is most likely to fall on either January 6,20 or27, 2018, said the Commissioner.
Deshapriya speaking to the Daily News explained that they were still in the process of finalising the Elections Register and that process could go on until October 10 or 15.
The Elections Commissions need a minimum of 75 days to prepare for an election and even if they are to start in October, it would be in December until a possible date would be available. Given the customary election procedure, this date should also fall on a Saturday.
Deshapriya however pointed out that they had issues holding elections in December due to the earliest available date of December 9 was the date on which O/L exams started and thus they would clash with the Department of Examinations if they were to hold elections at such a time.
In addition, the Elections Department is yet to receive the amendments passed on the Municipal Council Amendments, Urban Council Ordinance, and the Pradeshiya Sabha Acts.
The Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils had also published the gazette on amendments to the acts wrong and that gazette needs to be corrected, the Elections Commission Chairman said.
The older Gazette had the Colombo Municipal with 66 members in wards, 47 under PR (including seats reserved for women). Now we have 66 wards and 44 under PR. So earlier we had 113 and now we only have 110. Therefore, this has to be changed, Deshapriya said.

United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein on Monday urged the Sri Lankan Government to swiftly operationalise the Office of Missing Persons (OMP).
Hussein, making the opening statement at the 36th session of UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, gave an update of human rights issues in 40 countries.
Referring to Sri Lanka in the course of his speech, Hussein reiterated his request to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) with a new law in line with international human rights standards.
He also emphasised the need to fast track the release of land occupied by the military and resolving of long-pending cases registered under the PTA.
In the North, protests by victims indicate their growing frustration over the slow pace of reforms. I encourage the Government to act on its commitment in Resolution 30/1 to establish transitional justice mechanisms, and to establish a clear timeline and benchmarks for the implementation of these and other commitments, he stated.
This should not be viewed by the Government as a box-ticking exercise to placate the Council, but as an essential undertaking to address the rights of all its people. The absence of credible action in Sri Lanka to ensure accountability for alleged violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law makes the exercise of universal jurisdiction even more necessary, he added.
Sri Lanka at the UNHRC 34th session held in March this year received a two-year extended timeline to fulfill its commitments undertaken in the 2015 resolution. Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution in this regard and it was adopted without a vote.
Sri Lankas Permanent Mission to the UN in Geneva led by Ambassador Ravinath Aryasinha represents Sri Lanka at the 36th session of the Council from September 11 to 29.
Hussein in his opening remarks gave priority concern to deteriorating human right situation in Rakhine State in Myanmar, adding that over 270,000 people have fled to Bangladesh in less than three weeks according to the reports reaching the UNHRC.
Many more people reportedly remain trapped between Myanmar and Bangladesh. We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians he stated.
Turning to the subject of migration, Hussein expressed his concerns over the US Governments decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programme in six months time.
I am disturbed by the increase in detentions and deportations of well-established and law-abiding immigrants.Some migrants, including longstanding residents, are now so frightened of expedited deportation they refrain from accessing police protection and courtrooms, he stated referring to latest developments under the Trump administration.
The High Commissioner in his speech also discussed key concerns in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Cambodia, Yemen, Syria, Egypt, Bahrain, Venezuela, the United States, Turkey, Central African Republic, South Sudan, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Mali among others.
The High Commissioner, recalling that he had entered the final year of his current mandate, stated that he would discharge with vigour and determination in the remaining year.

Painted reunion
Reconciliation is a complicated, popular, mythical, repulsive, opportunistic, tragic, absurd and critical indication. At the same time it is the dream of the suppressed, the political armor and on which the scholars survive and the livelihood of the opportunists.
War is the most reckless and the ruthlessly plainest process pursued in order to reconcile or repress an ethnic, extremist, racial or a terrorist conflict. Yet, the repercussion of such reconciliation process too would be complex and conflict-ridden. The resulted social environment of a post-war condition is an arena, dark and still. It is again a cold and silent war; an invisible performance gazed at by many, thoughtlessly. The actors act but nothing is performed. The plot thickens once the war simply ends and then it is not either tragic or comic but obscurely tragicomic.
Its now nearly a decade since the ethnic conflict was put to an end in Sri Lanka but its ghostly shadow still lingers. Apart from the ethnicity, all the Sri Lankans are culprits as well as complainants of war and the government constantly attends to reconcile their conflicts. Through many social institutions such as education, politics, law and economy, this reconciliation process is activated, theoretically as well as practically.
The military personnel, general public, religious leadership and the political leadership were at focus of the ethnic conflict scenario than the other social institutions for the past three decades in Sri Lanka and at present, the post-war condition is absolutely portrayed through the reconciled conflict between them, I observe. The social structure, cultural environment, values and prospects, expectations, and the issues related to power give birth to conflict in the reconciliation process, among them.
This situation equals to the dialect of Hegal which reconciliation again create conflict with time and space.
Art is an exclusively humane creation which nourishes from the social institutions and vanishes in the same. Once a conflict resolving tool and then a device of destruction, art is an amazing expression of aesthetical potential.
In the contemporary practice, the visual form is prominent among the sturdy genres of art, strongly engaging in conflict reconciliation process, generating lexis and narratives at different spaces. Painting has gone far beyond the work of a wall decoration and it is the wording of social and personal expression, by now. The formal definitions of day to day objects have been concealed by the underlined aesthetical qualities, expanding the margins of visual art expression. The trend today is to provide multiple interpretations to visual expressions which built upon the structures of rationality.
We experience the displacement and the isolation of social reconciliation in the conflict between Capitalistic Marxism and Marxist Capitalism by now.
The individuals are in a constant struggle with and against their mentality which resulted by being subjected to the conflict between religion, law, education, politics, ethics and the reconciliation process, being unable either to accept the consequences or to refuse participation. Reconciliation is an expression of the above mentioned struggle, in the visual form of art.
The focus of this artwork collection is the contract and the functions of the different narratives of such contract between art and the other social institutions.

Paving the way for BIG DATA Analytics in SL
Sri Lanka is a land which is well acquainted with the concept of precognition, and a persistent desire to predict the future. Even the most rational among us cannot help but be tempted by the idea.
If you knew what was coming tomorrow, would you act differently What would you do How would things change Naturally, many have tried to step in and fulfill this latent demand for a more certain future. We see it in horoscopes, and in the confident proclamations of astrologers. Yet time and again, these intermediaries fall woefully short of providing any real insight to what lays ahead.
Tools change with the times, and todays technological innovations are rapidly enabling a brave and exciting new world of possibilities, one in which data becomes a catalyst for an economy, a society, and a nation that is free to unleash its true potential.
Across the globe, we see numerous examples of predictive analytics enabled by rapid advances in the ability of a given organization to collate and analyze massive quantities of data  essentially enabling a given macro-situation to be analyzed simultaneously at face value, down the most minute, granular level. This approach is capable of driving entirely unprecedented paradigms of development in nearly every facet of life.
From the way we grow our food, to the way we run our businesses; from the treatment of disease, to the development of breakthrough products and services in the banking and financial sector; from predicting natural disasters to developing smarter financial models, change is coming, and big-data is the key. Our emerging digital economy will ultimately operate according to a drastically different set of rules, and success in this new environment boils down to how we frame an issue, and how intelligently we respond to the insights we are given.
The devil is in the details.
While the general approach of how big-data works is fairly consistent, its application and integration into different industries can be a bit more complex. Consequently, specific approaches must be tailored for each sector. Generally speaking, big-data is simply a catch-all term used to describe a process by which predictive mathematical algorithms are applied to very large, complex, rapidly-changing datasets in order to extract precise, reliable insights into what is most likely to happen next, based on a complete analysis of every such situation in the past.
As is often the case, it is the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) that is often the first adopter of cutting-edge technologies and Though many BFSI organizations are beginning to disrupt their analytics landscapes by gathering immense volumes of data assets, these companies are at varying levels of Big Data maturity. As customer volume increases, it dramatically affects the level of services offered by the organization. Existing data analytics practices have simplified the process of monitoring and evaluation of banks and other financial services organizations, including vast amounts of client data such as personal and security information. But with the help of Big Data, banks can now use this information to continually track client behavior in real time, providing the exact type of resources needed at any given moment. This real-time evaluation will in turn boost overall performance and profitability, thus thrusting the organization further into the growth cycle.
In agriculture too, big-data is taking a figurative sledgehammer to centuries old inefficiencies. Globally, it is estimated that US$ 940 billion every year as a result of inefficiencies in planting, harvesting, water use and trucking, as well as uncertainty about weather, pests, consumer demand, all of which contribute to greater uncertainty, which further compromises the ability of the sector to be responsive to change.
Once again, it appears that big-data will play an increasingly vital role in resolving these challenges. Through the deployment of purpose designed sensors, farmers are gaining granular visibility into oil conditions, as well as detailed info on wind, fertilizer requirements, water availability and pest infestations. GPS units on tractors, combines and trucks can help determine optimal usage of heavy equipment. Data analytics can help prevent spoilage by moving products faster and more efficiently. Unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, can patrol fields and alert farmers to crop ripeness or potential problems.
One common thread that runs through all of greatest success stories in big-data is found in the structured approach taken to adoption. It is simply not enough to implement these solutions simply because the competition is doing the same. Rather, each step into the world of big-data must be calculated, precise, and based on the fundamental question: what will this information do for my organization
The potential for big-data in Sri Lanka
Currently, the Sri Lankan market is already playing host to several important experiments into the field of big data, however the reason for their importance is more to do with the fact that these are historic first steps, rather than the fact that they are revolutionary steps forward. Nevertheless, we must learn to crawl before we can learn to walk, and in Sri Lanka, we see some extremely encouraging signs with regard to the uptake of big-data.
Often times, Sri Lankan companies are unaware of the wealth of data that they possess or have easy access to based on procedural records generated by the business over time. Simply by being a little more precise about what how they analyze their data, companies can gain unprecedented insights into employee performance, operational efficiency, product popularity, and customer preferences. Equipped with this knowledge, organisations can categorize their customers into distinct segments defined by their demographics, regular transactions, and any other fields relevant to a given business. Such businesses can tailor their service offering, products portfolio and marketing campaigns to have the most impact on customers including through the use of personalized marketing.
As with most international cases, in Sri Lanka too, we anticipate the banking and finance sector to lead country into the field of big data, and already the first tentative steps in this direction have been taken by leading financial institutions in the country, however, the true potential of big data in this sector remains largely untapped. This potential can be directed towards internal improvements to processes such as in areas of fraud detection to ensuring compliance with regulatory and statutory requirements, but can also be utilized towards driving a deeper understanding of the customer, a factor essential to success in any service industry.
My analyzing social media, transaction histories and comparing such behavior with customers in similar categories, Sri Lankan banks will be able to deploy predictive analytics to determine with unprecedented accuracy what a given customer will do, and what type of services they will require, even before the customer realizes their own need.
Such techniques can be similarly utilized in the retail sector, or the leisure sector to deliver targeted promotions based on criteria such as customer preferences and stock availability in order to ensure optimized sales.
A single bill might not reveal much, but the entirety of an organisations billing records can be mined for invaluable data. In retail, it could be deployed to determine at what times of the day, week, month or year a particular product reaches peak popularity.
In the public sector, these technologies can be utilized to save lives, predicting future natural disasters and helping to mitigate them both through the ability to provide longer warning periods for evacuation and in terms of assisting in the coordination of relief efforts. Most importantly, while the functionality of big-data is growing at an exponential rate, the costs associated with them are not. Indeed the big data analytics tools of today are available at a fraction of the cost and ultimately, we are confident that it is not necessarily the size of the investment, but the intelligence behind it that will determine who emerges as the next generation of business and corporate leaders. In the age of information, knowledge is power.

Petition against cruelty against dogs, cats fixed for support
A public interest litigation seeking an interim order, directing the Inspector General of Police and relevant authorities to take immediate and effective measures to prevent the killing, murder, maiming, abusing or any other cruelty against dogs and cats was yesterday fixed for support by Supreme Court.
Twenty nine individuals including 25 monks had filed this fundamental rights petition through Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena with counsel Charitha Rupasinghe and counsel Sandamali Chandrasekara.
The petitioners cited the Inspector General of Police, Vice Chancellor of the Jayawardenapura University and 36 other parties as respondents.
A three-judge-bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Priyantha Jayawardena and Justice Nalin Perera fixed the matter for support on October 13.
The petitioners stated that there has been an exponential, proliferation of the killing of dogs, within state institutions, public property, streets and other public places, under the control, supervision and over-arching administration of state and executive functionaries, which has reached alarming and chilling proportions, and which has resulted in a massive, concerted public outcry and public outburst against such unmitigated brutality, and inhumaneness.
The Petitioners stated that according to Buddhism, every living being has the right to life and the right to live without suffering, at the hands of another. The first precept in Buddhism is I shall not Kill. Lord Buddha, during his life time and through many of the JAHAKA KATHA, has postulated the reverence and sanctity and the premium that has to be placed on life itself, be it the life of a human or the life of an animal.
The Petitioners further state that the close link between man and the dog, being mans best friend, is not only a bond that has been recognized by Buddhism (with several of the JATHAKA KATHA using a dog as an example), but is a bond that has been in existence from prehistoric times and is celebrated throughout the world (which is evident from animal welfare laws of Europe, India).
There are various documented and undocumented incidents and accounts of such phenomena, which are being highlighted and fortunately coming to light, as a result of a well mobilised public opinion, being galvanized against these utterly condemnable, and unlawful actions on the part of these state and executive functionaries.

PTL earned massive profits by selling TB to State institutions: DSG
Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Milinda Gunatilake yesterday led evidence before the Treasury Bond Commission suggesting that Perpetual Treasuries Limited(PTL) has recorded phenomenal profits by selling Treasury Bonds to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and other State institutions at low yield rates in November 2015, April and March 2016.
DSG Gunatilake said in the periods, there are no sales of Treasury Bonds recorded where PTL has sold bonds higher than at 10.01 yield rate. Drawing evidence from a document submitted to the Central Bank, including details of the outright sales of PTL in the period, DSG Gunatilake pointed out to the commission that PTL has not done any outright sales below the yield rate of 10.01 other than the EPF.
Gunatilake said PTL has given higher yield rates such as 10.91, 10.95, 10.85 to all other market counter parties where as it has sold to EPF at low rates, the highest among them being a 9.31 yield rate in November 2015. According to Gunatilake, no other party in the bond market has bought from PTL lower than 10.50 yield rate other than EPF.
Answering to Gunatilake, Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena said the suggestion may be correct. But the market could have changed within the buying and selling dates. A market can change in hours or even minutes, Palisena said.
Gunatilake taking on an outright sale on June 11, 2015, pointed out to the commission that the capital gain made by PTL from selling to EPF, was Rs. 19, 378, 200. In the same sale, PTL has recorded a gain of Rs. 87, 469, 500 by initially selling the bonds to W.M. Mendis and Company. When PTL bought back the same bonds from W.M. Mendis and company, the said party has recorded a capital gain of Rs. 2,005,200. The details were extracted from the capital gain report given to the Central Bank by PTL in 2016.
Palisena in reply to the above suggestion said he might have to check the transaction process. Gunatilake said: If you are denying the process or the gains, I suggest that the documents you provided to the Central Bank is wrong.
Taking upon another outright sale by PTL, Gunatilake pointed out how PTL has sold a bond with same ICIN at different rates to EPF and other market parties. Accordingly, on June 11, 2015, PTL sells at a 10.50 yield rate to EPF whereas selling the same to other market parties at 11.50.
Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena questioned the witness on the same matter. Pointing out to an outright sale of 50 million worth bonds on November 6, 2015 by PTL, Justice Jayawardena asked if the transaction was a sell and buy back. According to Palisena, the transaction most probably would have been a sell and buy back.
Justice Jayawardena: all along you have been happily identifying most of these deals as sell and buy backs. This transaction has the same deal number and the same date
Palisena: Yes.
JJ: So, accordingly, you will buy back the bonds you sold on sell and buy back agreements
P: Yes. But some were rolled over as well.
JJ: So, look at this deal, you will buy back the bonds you sold, on November 13, 2015
P: This deal was rolled over.
JJ: So, it means on this agreed transaction on November 13, 2015, there was no such buy back
P: Yes.
DSG Gunatilake: That bridges the gap where we could identify some cancellations of buy back agreements.
Meanwhile, on Monday, evidence was led suggesting that PTL has incurred losses in inter-company transactions where it transferred its profits during the period from February 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016. The loss incurred by the profit transfer, DSG Gunatilake suggested, was amounting to Rs. 700 million.

Rebel Wilson wins record 2.7m payout in Australian libel case

Australian actress Rebel Wilson has won record-breaking damages from a global magazine publisher found to have portrayed her as a serial liar.
The Pitch Perfect star was awarded a total of $4.6m (2.7m) in damages from Bauer Media in Australia over articles that claimed she had lied about her age and real name, and fabricated childhood events.
The payout is thought to be the highest ever awarded for defamation in an Australian court.
It was largely based on roles and earnings lost by the actress, who testified in frequently emotional court appearances that she had been sacked from the Dream Works productions Trolls and Kung Fu Panda 3 as a result of the articles.
It comes after a jury of six returned unanimous verdicts in favour of Wilson in June.
Justice John Dixon said the payout was necessary to "vindicate" Wilson after her reputation as an "actress of integrity was wrongly damaged".
Bauer Media said it was considering the judgment. It had previously branded the damages claim "extraordinarily large" and on the "most tenuous of basis".
The stories appeared in Women's Day Australia, Australian Women's Weekly, NW and OK Magazine in 2015.
Wilson has previously said she will donate the money won in the case to charity, a scholarship or the Australian film industry
Following the case, she tweeted from the UK that she would be reviewing the ruling with her lawyers before making a statement.
The actress rose to prominence with her roles in comedies including Bridesmaids.

A number of residents of the Kurunegala Division have complained that they have not been paid due compensations for the lands that were acquired by the Government for the proposed expressway to be built via Kurunegala.
The construction of the expressway is now in process disregarding the objections of the residents of Malpitiya, Boyagane, Henamulla, Amunaatta and Gettuwana areas.
Herbot Gunathilake of the Pubudu Farmers Organisation, Nailiya, told that their lands were acquired by the Government by force and government authorities didnt express clearly as to how compensations will be paid to the residents who lose their land and properties in this regard.
"The Government has not paid even a cent as compensation on this issue so far. We are utterly helpless and we have nowhere to go," D. A. K. Ranasinghe, a resident of Nailiya village, told the Daily News.
However, Kurunegala UNP Parliamentarian and Deputy Minister of Transport Ashok Abeysinghe said, all steps would be taken soon to pay the land owners with due compensations, but that process would take a considerable length of time.

Rohingya Genocide links to corporatism, geopolitics and wahhabism
The humanitarian crisis in Myanmar is harrowing, with more than 150,000 Muslims having to flee the country in the recent months. The stories of persecution and ethnic cleansing are very troubling, although sporadic conflicts between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar have existed for many decades. While the mainstream media is focusing exclusively on the religious context of this story, they are completely missing  or deliberately avoiding  the potential roles of oil/gas pipelines, geopolitical U.S.-China tug of war, and Saudi Arabias subversive influence in that region.
Lets start with the obvious  the western media is not going to shed crocodile tears for some people in a faraway place such as Myanmar, unless there is some hidden agenda related to billions of dollars and the Deep State.
Some basic facts about Myanmar:
* Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is the largest country in South East Asia.
* Although a poor country that hasnt been in the radar of globalists for many decades, it has become a very strategic piece of land in Chinas new Silk Road (a.k.a One Belt, One Road). Of course, any country thats important to China becomes an object of exceptional interest to the elites in Washington D.C.
* Myanmar was under military rule for many decades, and then slowly started opening up its economy in the 1990s. The reforms accelerated in 2006, after which foreign investments skyrocketed.
* Dubbing Myanmar the last Asian frontier, mining corporations and oil/gas companies from all over the world rushed into Myanmar and discovered plenty of untapped natural resources. Myanmars GDP quadrupled in the last ten years, thanks to revenues from natural gas, tin, forestry, rubber, gold, precious metals (jade) and more. Unfortunately, all these operations also result in ruthless exploitation of labourers, destruction of environment, and mass eviction of people from their lands.
* Rohingya Muslims are primarily concentrated in a state on the west coast in Myanmar. Its not a coincidence that the state is adjacent to Bangladesh, an Islamic country. Rohingya people are basically Muslims who came to Myanmar from Bangladesh (roughly speaking, since theres a lot of history here, going back to the British colonies in the 19thcentury).
Geopolitics
China has two goals vis-a-vis the Myanmar pipelines and deep sea ports. The first is obvious: import natural gas from Myanmar.
The second goal is a little more complex. Its about.
1. Creating a shorter route for oil tankers and cargo ships from the Middle East and beyond, which can drop off the merchandise in Myanmar rather than having to go all the way around South East Asia. This saves 2000 miles or two weeks of travel.
2. The second reason is that China wants to lessen its dependence on the sea lanes in South China Sea and especially the path through the narrow Strait of Malacca, which can be quickly blocked if theres a conflict or a war. And, yes, that hypothetical conflict would involve the U.S.
Wherever Chinas Silk Road goes, the U.S. is going to follow it, and Myanmar is no exception. For example, WikiLeaks emails exposed how the CIA funded grassroots organisation in Myanmar to disrupt a Chinese plan. Naughty as usual. Edward Snowden also revealed how the NSA uses the U.S. embassy in Myanmar as a spy central to snoop on all the countries in that region.
The fundamental goal of the U.S. is to pull Myanmar away from Chinas sphere of influence. And if that cant be accomplished, then chaos will be manufactured.
What else is in the CIAs tool bag to destabilize a country Islamic extremism and various avatars of the Mujahideen project. We have seen that in Syria and also recently in the Philippines. Which brings us to the puppet master, Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Wahhabism
Saudi Arabias biggest exports are oil and Wahhabism. One of the Asian victims of Saudi Wahhabism is Bangladesh, which has turned extremist in the recent years. Many progressive and secular bloggers and writers have been murdered in the last few years; ISIS and other Islamic terrorist groups (ABT, JMB) have targeted foreigners  for example, three Americans were hacked to death last year; and extremists have demolished many churches and Buddhist temples. As Bangladesh gets radicalized, so do Rohingya Muslims who live just across the border.
Rohingya separatist/militant/terrorist groups demand an Islamic state and have killed Myanmar soldiers, burned down Buddhist temples, murdered Buddhists etc. The leader of a powerful Rohingya terrorist group is a guy named Ata Ullah, and he is based out of Saudi Arabia. Other Rohingya leaders and insurgents are being trained by prominent terrorist groups in Pakistan and Bangladesh.
Its also possible that poor and illiterate people are being used as weapons of mass immigration. 30-40 million people in Bangladesh earn less than $2/day. Are some of them being deliberately sent into the areas in Myanmar where Chinese infrastructure projects are happening
Fake news corporate media uses atrocity propaganda to sell sensational stories, and politicians use faux outrage to bully Myanmars leaders. What we need instead is serious investigative journalism that exposes the multitude of players and their clandestine actions that are creating needless crisis in Myanmar and colossal suffering for the Rohingya people. - Nation of Change

The rot: from where it all began
Sri Lanka Cricket today finds itself in a messy state of affairs today because of the events that took place on March 8, 2016 when the current administration wielded its powers to throw out the selection committee headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Kapila Wijegunawardene and replace it with an adhoc committee to meet its own ends. The manner in which it was carried out was to say the least bordered on dictatorial lines and it took place on the eve of an important event as the ICC World Twenty20 tournament where Sri Lanka was to defend their title.
The changes done to the selection committee that was performing a wonderful task in rebuilding the side following a poor 2015 Cricket World Cup exit in Australia and New Zealand had long term and disastrous effects on the countrys cricket. It has led to two unprecedented defeats at the hands of two nations ranked lower than Sri Lanka  Bangladesh (in Tests) and Zimbabwe (in ODIs) that hurt the cricket loving nations pride, and to rub salt on the festering wound - a right royal drubbing from India where Sri Lanka was further humiliated by a 5-0 whitewash in an ODI series at home for the first time notwithstanding the crushing 3-0 defeat suffered in the Tests.
Today Sri Lanka Cricket finds itself struggling to put together a team of competent people to form a selection committee after the existing one headed by former captain Sanath Jayasuriya had resigned at the end of the Indian series on September 7.
The first signs of alleged meddling with team selections and direct influence over cricket matters the present SLC administration headed by Thilanga Sumathipala stands accused of today began with the dismissal of the Wijegunawardene selection committee that also comprised former Sri Lanka cricketers Amal Silva, Brendon Kuruppu and Hemantha Wickremaratne. They had already selected the squads for the T20 Asia Cup and the World T20 to meet with the ICC deadline.
What transpired thereafter is a clear breach of meddling with team selections. Following the Asia Cup the SLC hierarchy surprisingly obtained an extension from the ICC to extend the deadline to declare the final World T20 squad and having done so tried to bring pressure on the Wijegunawardene selection committee to re-select the squad with Angelo Mathews as captain. In the original squad Lasith Malinga was named the captain but he surprisingly tended his resignation after the Asia Cup when he suspected sinister moves were being made behind the scenes without his knowledge. The selection committee stood firm with their decision and informed the Minister of Sports with copies to the Secretary Ministry of Sports and all top officials of SLC notifying him that there are moves afoot to interfere with the T20 World Cup team officially ratified by the Minister. The selection committee further stated that they would only even consider such an undertaking if written instructions are received from the Sports Minister.
The selection committee however met again and made changes to the World T20 squad to replace the injured players, but the changes made are ignored by the SLC hierarchy. On the same day (March 8) the national selection committee is informed by the Director-General that they are sacked by the Sports Minister and a new selection committee comprising Aravinda de Silva, Kumar Sangakkara, Romesh Kaluwitharana and Lalith Kaluperuma is appointed for a period of one month. Last minute changes are made and two youngsters picked on merit are unceremoniously and unfairly hauled out of the squad and replaced with two other players one of whom wasnt even declared in the provisional squad of 25 players. These two talented youngsters turn up all dressed up to travel to India but told they are not boarding the aircraft.
The sacked selection committee is told that the official letters of removal shall be sent across the following day. These letters allegedly never arrived. The appointment and removal of National Selection Committees are expedited through a Gazette notification conforming to the Sports Law. In that aspect some pertinent questions that beg answers for are; was the National Selection Committee officially removed through a Gazette notification as warranted under the laws of the land Was the new National Selection Committee officially appointed through a Gazette notification If affirmative, were these functions carried out on a Poya day (March 9, 2016) If they were not, then these changes were in breach of the law Perhaps the newly enacted Right to Information Act (RIA) can provide answers to these important questions.
The consequences of such an act carried out by the SLC hierarchy is what we witness today and the question that needs to be asked is arent the four ex-cricketers who volunteered to carry out the dirty deeds of the present administration need to take complete responsibility for the depths to which cricket in this country has sadly plummeted

SAARC Arbitration Council to conduct seminar on Arbitration
Sinhaputhra Finance PLC, in collaboration with the SAARC Arbitration Council is organizing a seminar mainly to discuss how to adopt arbitration as a litigation process for a speedier recovery method specially in debt recovery, be it in the Banking and Finance sector or in any other sector which has debt recovery issues.
The Seminar will be held on September 23, 2017 in Kandy at Sinhaputhra Finance PLC Auditorium. It will be organized by Thusantha Wijemanna, the Director General of SARCO, who has been a much sought after speaker at Banking and Finance company seminars since the early 1990s.
The Chief guest will be K. Kanag Isvaran P.C. who may be known as "The father of Arbitration in Sri Lanka" a distinguished senior lawyer who has written widely on the subject, including publishing the only available book on this procedure in Sri Lanka.
Speakers at this seminar will be an Judge of the High Court Judge, K. Kanag Isvaran PC, Mohan Weerakoon PC, Kaushalya Nawaratne, Attorney-at-Law, Thusantha Wijemanna Director General SARCO, Ravana Wijeyeratne, Managing Director Sinhaputhra Finance PLC, Faazaan Mirza, SARCO.
This seminar is suited for CEOs, Heads of Legal and Heads of recoveries of Banks, Finance Companies, and other large companies saddled with debt recovery as a central concern.
Many companies over the years have used arbitration as a speedier method of debt recovery. Since by and large Arbitration takes care of the trial stage at the locations and frequency of sittings desired by the parties, this otherwise long drawn out process can be reduced to less than three months.
In finality as it also ends up as an enforcement of the arbitral award from the High Court, it is deemed more powerful than a district court judgement. Some institutions have had more success than others in using arbitration.
However, it is generally not the preferred choice of the legal fraternity. Yet even within lawyers there is much debate that the method could be beneficial to their profession in the long run and certainly to instill confidence in the legal system that is currently regarded as a very time consuming process. Regardless of this debate, it is undoubtedly an area that one can all learn more about.

Sri Lanka's export problem: not concentration, but composition
The Economics Research Team of Verit Research compiled this study. The report was written by Subhashini Abeysinghe, with support from Hasna Munas. Malathy Knight and Azra Jafferjee contributed with overall research and editorial guidance.
Verit Research aims to be a leader in the provision of information and analysis for negotiations and policy making in Asia, while also promoting dialogue and education for social development in the region. The firm contributes actively to research and dialogue in the areas of economics, sociology, politics, law, and media, and provides services in data collection, information verification, strategy development, and decision analysis.
Sri Lanka's Export Problem: Not Concentration, but Composition
Reviving exports has been a key policy priority of the government since it came into power in 2015. The government aims to increase Sri Lanka's exports from USD 10.5 billion in 2016 to USD 18 billion by 2020.1 The country's exports were stagnant in dollar terms from 2011-2016. Exports stood at 12.7% of GDP in 2016 - a significant drop from 33.3% of GDP in 2000.
Sri Lanka's exports are heavily concentrated on a few markets and a few products. The government's recognition of export diversification as an important policy strategy to revive exports, indicates that both market and product concentration are seen as critical bottlenecks in this regard.
This report compares and contrasts Sri Lanka's export product and market concentration and its export composition against that of the world and selected Asian economies. The objective of this brief analysis is to understand where Sri Lanka stands in the world and in comparison to its neighbours that have performed well in terms of export concentration and composition.
The countries selected for comparison in this report are all Asian economies that were among the top 25 exporters in the world in 2016. Three of the selected markets - South Korea, Singapore and Japan - are high-income countries, while the other three are middle-income countries. Among these middle-income economies, Thailand and Malaysia are upper middle-income, and Vietnam is lower middle-income, like Sri Lanka. The size of these countries in terms of GDP, land and population varies significantly. Yet, as set out in this report, trade statistics reveal common features among these countries in terms of market concentration and composition.
Export concentration refers to the dependence of export earnings on specific markets and products. Market concentration is expressed as a percentage of exports that depend on a given number of markets or a given number of products. For example, 44% of Sri Lanka's exports are concentrated in three markets. Export composition refers to the makeup of markets and products that a country's exports are concentrated in. For example, the three key markets that account for 44% of Sri Lanka's exports are the USA, UK and India.
This analysis reveals the following important insights about Sri Lanka's export problem:
The reliance of exports on a few products and a few markets is not unique to Sri Lanka. The exports of Asian countries selected for the analysis also depend heavily on a small number of markets and products. The export success of these selected Asian economies indicates that a high degree of export concentration does not necessarily cause sluggish export performance (see Exhibits 1 and 6).
The world market for exports is also heavily concentrated in a few markets and few product categories. The heavy concentration in both export destinations and products of the selected Asian countries corresponds to the concentration in the world market. (see Exhibits 3 & 7).
Sri Lanka's export structure differs from that of the world and the other Asian countries in its composition of markets and products, not in their concentration (see Exhibits 1 & 6).
World trade has shifted towards Asia between 2001-2016. The market composition of Asian countries has shifted in line with the world market trend. However, Sri Lanka's exports fare poorly in leading Asian markets and continue to be overly dependent on few leading Western markets (see Exhibits 4 & 5).
Sri Lanka's variance with world trends is particularly striking in terms of product composition. The country's top two exports are not even among the top ten products traded in the world. In contrast, the top two exports of the Asian countries selected for this analysis fall within the top five product categories traded in the world.
This analysis indicates that Sri Lanka's export problem may not necessarily be in the extent of it product and market concentration but rather their composition  the particular markets and product categories in which the concentration persists.
2. Export Market Concentration and Composition
2.1. Market concentration: Sri Lanka is not an outlier
(See Graph 1)
The market concentration measured in terms of the percentage of exports that goes to the leading three markets of the selected Asian countries and Sri Lanka is shown in Exhibit 1.
The Exhibit indicates that the exports of all these countries, including Sri Lanka, are highly concentrated in a few markets. Three of the selected markets have high levels of concentration of over 40% like Sri Lanka; and over 30% of the exports of the other three countries are also concentrated in just three markets. As such, Sri Lanka is not an outlier in terms of depending on a few markets to generate a large share of the country's export revenue.
2.2. Export concentration of countries reflects global trends
The world market for exports is heavily concentrated on a few countries. According to the Trade Map of the International Trade Centre, in 2016 there were 228 trading nations that imported goods to the combined value of USD 16 trillion. Five countries alone accounted for 38% of the total world imports in 2016 (see Exhibit 2), and 20 out of the 228 accounted for 72% of the world market for imports. The remaining 96% of trading nations accounted for less than one-third of the world market. Thus, the concentration of a country's exports in a few markets is in fact a reflection of the global import concentration of products in a few markets.
While the skewed nature of world trade has remained the same over the years, there have been internal shifts in its makeup since the turn of the century. The notable change in composition has been China's increasing share: China moved up four places to become the world's second largest importer with a market share of 9.9% in 2016 compared to 3.9% in 2001 (see Exhibit 3). Chinese imports grew over six-fold from USD 243 billion to USD 1,588 billion over this period.
The other notable shift has been the emergence of India as an important market for the worlds exports. India moved up 11 places from 2001 to 2016 to become the 14th largest importer in the world (see Annex 1).
India's imports grew over seven-fold during this period from USD 50 billion to USD 357 billion, and the country's world market share increased from 0.8% to 2.2%.
Both China and India were the only two economies of the top 20 trading nations to experience annual average growth rates of over 20% during 2001-2016 in comparison to a 10% average growth of world imports. Growth in world demand for exports has considerably dampened in the last decade, with an average of only 1.4% between 2007 - 2016. However, imports to China and India have remained relatively robust, growing at over 5%.
(See Graph 2)
Largely aided by these two Asian giants, the share of Asian imports within the top 20 countries has increased from 25% to 35% between 2001 and 2016. These shifts indicate that while a larger share of world trade continues to be concentrated in the West, this share has declined significantly.
2.3. Market composition: Limited success in Asia makes Sri Lanka different from the rest
While Sri Lanka's level of market concentration is similar to that of the other countries, China emerges as the notable difference between the composition of Sri Lanka's top three export markets and that of the other selected Asian economies (see Exhibit 1). China is among the top three export markets of all the selected countries except Sri Lanka. While China accounted for over 10% of exports of these selected countries, it accounted for only 2% of Sri Lanka's exports in 2016 (see Exhibit 5).
Overall, Sri Lanka demonstrates limited success in exporting to key Asian markets: Japan, China, South Korea and Hong Kong. These four countries are among the top ten markets for exports in the world, accounting for 20% of the total value of the market (i.e. USD 3 trillion) in 2016.
In contrast, these three countries accounted for only 6% of Sri Lanka's exports in 2016 (USD 619 billion). Sri Lanka's only success in Asia remains India (see Exhibit 5). While India has advanced rapidly as an important market for exports, it is currently ranked at 14, well below Japan, China, Hong Kong and South Korea (see Annex 1).
A detailed analysis of Sri Lanka's exports to key Asian markets with that of Vietnam and Thailand further confirms this trend (see Exhibits 4 and 5).
The world market value of the three key Asian markets - Japan, China and India - increased fourfold from USD 644 billon to USD 2,552 billion between 2001-2016. Sri Lanka's share of exports to these three markets in 2016 was 11%, compared to Thailand's and Vietnam's share of 23% and 28%, respectively.
In addition to China, a notable difference in the composition of Asian markets that has an impact on Thailand, Vietnam and Sri Lanka is the role of Japan. Sri Lankan exports have barely made it into the Japanese market despite the country being a leading market for exports for decades. In comparison, Japan has remained a key market for the exports of Thailand and Vietnam (see Exhibit 5).
This analysis reveals that Sri Lanka has been out of sync largely in terms of market composition rather than in terms of market concentration, in comparison to the world market and selected Asian countries. This is largely due to the limited success of Sri Lankan exports in Asian markets.
(See Graph 3)
3. Export Product Concentration and Composition
3.1. Product concentration: Sri Lanka is not an outlier
This section relies on the harmonised system of classification (HS) of products developed by the World Customs Organization to assess the product concentration and composition of exports.
The broadest categorisation of products under the HS classification (at 2-digit level) aggregates all products traded in the world into 97 categories.
Exhibit 6 shows the level of export concentration of the largest two product categories exported out of the 97 product categories for selected Asian countries, including Sri Lanka. The data reveals that a heavy reliance on a few product categories is not unique to Sri Lanka and that other countries also show similar trends. Compared to Sri Lanka, some of the other Asian economies identified as export success stories, such as Singapore and Vietnam, show even higher levels of product concentration.
(See Graph 4)
3.2. Product concentration is a global feature
The world market is heavily concentrated on a few products categories (see Exhibit 7) as it is on a few countries. The top five categories of exports in the world account for 43% of thetotal world market. Therefore, it is to be expected that a country's exports would be concentrated in these products that are mostly in demand in the world. The levels of concentration and composition of key product categories traded in the world have remained the same over the years.
(See Graph 5)
3.3. Product composition: Sri Lanka is a clear outlier
Unlike in the case of export markets, where a significant portion of Sri Lanka's exports end up in leading world markets, only a small portion of the country's exports belongs to the top five product categories traded in the world (see Exhibit 8). While the five leading product categories account for 43% of the total world market, only 7% of Sri Lanka's exports belong to the top five traded in the world. In contrast, over 40% of the exports of all the other selected Asian countries fall within these top five product categories.
(See Graph 6)
In terms of product composition, Sri Lanka's two leading exports are not among even among the top ten product categories traded in the world (see Annex 2 for product details). In contrast, the two key export product categories of all the other selected Asian countries fall within at least one of the top five product categories traded in the world.
Sri Lanka's two key export product categories (HS 61 and 62 - Apparel) that accounted for 44% of the country's exports in 2016 constituted only 2% of the world market. In contrast, the two leading exports of the other selected Asian economies belonged to product categories that accounted for over 20% of the world market (see Exhibits 6 and 7). 53%
3.4. Is product composition a factor that determines Sri Lanka's market composition
The heavy reliance of Sri Lanka's export products on Western markets such as the USA and the UK is mainly the result of the Sri Lanka's product composition.
These two markets accounted for 36.5% of Sri Lanka's total exports in 2016. Out of total exports to these two countries, 75% to the USA and 79% to the UK comprised of apparel exports (HS 61 and 62). These markets together accounted for 64% of Sri Lanka's total apparel exports in 2016.
The value of the world market for apparel in 2016 was USD 396 billion. As shown in Exhibit 9, the UK and the USA are among the five leading destinations for apparel exports, accountingfor 27.4% of the world market. The data clearly shows that the heavy reliance on the USA and the UK is driven by Sri Lanka's export composition.
Exports to Japan however, demonstrate that Sri Lankan exports have faced challenges in Asia, even when there is a large market for the country's key export products. For example, Japan is one of the top five markets in the world for apparel.
However, the country accounted for only 0.9% of Sri Lanka's total apparel exports in 2016. China accounted for 1.4% of Sri Lanka's total apparel exports in the same year and remains a relatively small market for apparel, both in terms of share and value.
Thus, while product composition explains the heavy concentration in the USA and the UK, it does not necessarily explain Sri Lanka's limited success in terms of accessing Asian markets, particularly Japan. This analysis indicates that in addition to product composition, other factors seem to have played a role in limiting the success of Sri Lankan products in Asian markets.
Although this report does not delve into identifying these factors, a solid understanding of these issues will be key to succeeding in these markets.

Travelling cat circus helps save feline lives
Its tough to imagine anything that could make The Amazing Acro-Cats - a travelling troupe of house cats that ride skateboards, play musical instruments and sometimes get bored and wander off into the audience - even more awesome.
As it turns out, there is something: The group has helped save the lives of more than 200 kittens over the past several years.
The team [of cats] themselves are all former rescues and strays, Acro-Cats founder Samantha Martin told HuffPost.
In 2009 - about four years after Martin started the group - she got inspired to take an even more active role in helping felines in need. She was hoping to adopt a kitten she could train as a new member of the Acro-Cats. Her search led her to a crowded, high-kill shelter in .
A worker there told Martin that several kittens desperately needed foster homes, and that whichever ones werent housed immediately would likely end up on that nights euthanasia list.
I took all 12, Martin said, which she called a life-changing moment.
Fostering a shelter pet means taking in the animal until it finds a permanent adoptive home. Kittens are usually highly adoptable, but animal shelters are often not well-equipped to care for orphan kittens younger than 8 weeks old, as they need bottle feeding and overnight care. Plus, animals typically find foster homes less stressful than a shelter environment.
Martin didnt end up making any of those kittens part of her, er, purrr-manent cast, she did help find good homes for all of them. And those first dozen kittens started a lasting legacy for Martin and the Acro-Cats.
These days, Martin, her human assistants and 17 cats  16 performers plus Captain Patch, a one-eyed, non-performing feline who belongs to an assistant  tend to travel the country with a few foster kittens in tow.
The kittens reside in a deluxe three-level space inside a specially outfitted cat bus.
The foster kittens never have problems adapting to life on the tour bus, Martin said. Since they are kittens, theyre much more adaptable to new places and experiences.
Over the years, Martin and human Acro-Cats team members have fostered an estimated 209 kittens. Most have found new homes, although a few especially promising ones have wound up sticking around to become performers.
Because Acro-Cats tour the , their kittens come from all over.
We try to partner with a local rescue and donate a portion of the [shows] proceeds, she said. Sometimes people just contact us. It can be very random.
The Acro-Cats are also improving feline lives in another way  by proving that yes, cats can be trained.
A lot of cats are relinquished because of behavioral problems, Martin said. And the reason they have behavioral problems is because theyre bored.
Of course, not all behavioral issues are due to boredom; owners should check with a vet if their cat is acting in an alarming way. But boredom can often lead to destructive behavior, aggression and even health problems.
They need interaction, Martin said. They need a way to use their brain. Some cats more than others.
Thats where training can help. Martin stressed the importance of using only positive reinforcement that means no punishments when working with your cats. She uses clicker training, which involves getting cats to associate a clicking sound with a desired behavior and subsequent reward. (You can learn more about clicker training, and training your cat, here.)
Your cats may never be ready for primetime, but Martin said teaching your pets some basic tricks is a great way to keep them mentally stimulated and strengthen your bond. She recommended starting with short sessions of around 10 minutes a day.
After all, you dont want to overdo it. Even Martins professional troupe has plenty of off-time. The cats are my pets, Martin said, explaining that they roam her home like normal house cats when they arent on tour. People always ask, are they ever allowed to just be cats Theyre always just cats.

Uday Shankar who sired Indian fusion dances
A dedicated artistes life is full of struggles and hardships. Normally after a lifelong battle only the artistes sacrifices and their contributions which get some sort of social recognition. But even after their period, their great contribution and sacrifices are many often forgotten by the society.
Uday Shaker was born in the village of Udaipur in Rajasthan, in a rich Zamindahri Brahmin family on December 8, 1900. When he was young he travelled all over India. His father was in the state service, due to it, he got an opportunity to travel from one place to another place in different states. Finally, his family settled down in Jhalawar. When he was young he got numerous opportunities to watch a variety of dances, especially during the Holi festival time.
Numerous opportunities
These dances fascinated and influenced the young mind of Uday Shankar. During his childhood, he got an opportunity to live in different states of India including Rajasthan, Utter Pradesh and West Bengal. His father used to visit abroad, for numerous lecture tours. During his fathers absence, he went and stayed at his paternal grandfathers house, where he got numerous opportunities to watch a variety of social, religious and cultural celebrations and festivals. All these functions and festivals influenced the young Uday Shankars mind.
During his younger days, with his friends, he led a carefree life by swimming in the river Ganga and viewing numerous street dances like Nautanki and Baiji. Anyhow his mother couldnt control her son much, due to the restricted female freedom in those days. His mother had no daughters, so she adorned her elder son Uday as a female. Once he dressed as a woman and danced as a Rajasthan female dancer, but nobody realized that he was a male dancer.
All the ideas, which he gathered from the Indian celebrations, festivals and shows were deeply influenced in his subconscious mind. All these factors molded his own creativity in his artistic field. With the passage of time all the ideas which he gathered from his childhood, helped him to develop his own creativity dances in his later stage of his life.
Inborn talents
Many orthodox Hindu families didnt accept his child hood pranks. Yet one of his art masters realized his inborn talents and helped him to cherish to develop his own talents. At the end of First World War, his father returned to India from London. And their family shifted to Jhalawar. His father noticed his sons potential talents in painting and Indian instrumental music.
In 1918, he was sent to the J.J school of arts in Bombay. The principle of the J.J school of arts asked him to go and study magnificent drawing and painting at the British Museum. In 1920, Uday sailed to London to learn art at Royal art school, where his exceptional talent gained more recognition among the staff of the school. With the influence of certain Indians, he realized and understood the depth of the Indian culture. His studies and discoveries at the British museum further thrilled him.
During that time only he was deeply involved with Indian painting, Indian music, Indian musical instruments and Indian folk and Indian classical dances. He was the first Indian who won two prizes for his two portraits. Moreover, he got a scholarship to Rome where he got an opportunity to meet a Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. Unexpectedly the fate brought them together. She requested Uday Shankar to choreograph a dance show; he also agreed to choreograph two dances. He danced with her and he became a dance partner for her dance shows.
Starting point
By his hard work, he finally choreographed two items, namely Radha- Krishna, and Hindu wedding. Both of these items were produced in London and gained the international fame. This was his starting point for his self-styled fusion dance career. Further, Anna Pavlova invited him to join with her, for her American tour. But unfortunately, less opportunity was given to him by Anna Pavlova during that tour.
Due to his disappointment with her, he left Anna Pavlovas troupe as soon as he returned back. Then he returned to Paris and worked hard and practiced and rehearsed his own imaginative creativity dance based on rich Indian cultural and traditional links. During that period he was deeply influenced by Ananda K. Coomaraswamys Mirror of Gesture (English translation of Abiynayadarpana of Nandikeswara ). It further induced him to create his own dance with meaningful sense and essence.
Meanwhile, he got an opportunity to meet one French pianist, named Simon Barbiere who joined his troupe to help him in his orchestra and his dance troupe. In 1925, he performed at an International festival in Paris. This opportunity provided him to see further more dance forms of different other countries. All these dance forms influenced his creative mind. Meanwhile, his graceful creative dances also attracted the local audience of Paris, which provided him to display more dance shows in different parts of France.
Folk musical instruments
Later he returned back to India and studied the depth of Indian art and watched the performances of court dances and music recitals. He also collected beautiful Indian dance Jewellery, Indian research books and variety of Indian traditional and folk musical instruments. In 1938 he founded his own dance school, named Uday Shankar Indian Cultural Centre at Aloma in Uttar Pradesh. But during the Second World War period, this school was closed down and reopened in 1965.
He was very much taken up by the numerous folk dances and attracted by their aesthetic essence. He was very much attracted by Kathakali. He also saw the majestic magnified sculptures of Gods and temple decorative sculptural poses in temples and cultural chambers. He also visited Shantiniketan where he met Rabindranath Tagore.
After the Second World War Uday Shakar involved in the film industry and faced numerous financial crisis. With the passage of time in the 1960s, he moved to Calcutta, where he operated his own dance troupe. Later slowly and slowly his health condition started deteriorating. Once he was performing in Assam, he got a heart Attack and after one of his dance performances in the USA, on 26th of September 1977, at Calcutta, he passed away.

UK inflation rate rises to 2.9%
The UK's inflation rate climbed to its joint highest level in more than five years in August as the price of petrol and clothing rose.
UK inflation measured by the Consumer Prices Index rose to 2.9% in August, up from 2.6% in July, figures show.
The fall in the value of sterling since the EU referendum continued to be the main impetus for rising prices, the Office for National Statistics said.
But a rebound in the price of oil also had an impact, pushing up fuel prices.
The bigger-than-expected rise in inflation comes ahead of the Bank of England's next announcement on interest rates on Thursday.
However, economists said the Bank was still highly unlikely to raise rates at the meeting.
According to the ONS, clothing and footwear prices had the biggest impact on the headline inflation rate in August.
They climbed 4.6% year-on-year, their highest level since records began, partly because of rising import costs for retailers.
Petrol also pushed the overall cost of living higher, increasing 1.8p a litre to 115.7p during the month, while diesel gained 2p to 117.6p. The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said the "cost of living squeeze" was continuing, with rising inflation outpacing wages.
"The government needs to get a grip and get pay rising across the economy," she said. BBC News

US lawmakers oppose 92 percent cut in aid to Sri Lanka
Citing the geographical and strategic location of Sri Lanka, a US Senate committee has opposed Trump Administrations proposal of a drastic 92 percent cut in American aid to the country.
Given the geostrategic importance of the country, the Committee does not support the Presidents budget request for Sri Lanka, which proposed a 92 percent reduction in assistance from the prior fiscal year, the Senate Appropriations Committee said in a report passing the annual State appropriations bill for the fiscal year 2018, beginning October 1. The appropriations bill, which landed on the Senate floor yesterday for consideration, seeks USD 43 million for Sri Lanka. This includes USD 35 million as economic support fund, USD 6.8 million for non-proliferation and anti-terrorism and USD 500,000 in foreign military financing and an equal amount for training of military personnel. The Committee recognises and supports the efforts of the Sri Lankan government to advance democracy and the rule of law, and encourages further steps to address the causes of the armed conflict by promoting justice and reconciliation, the Senate Committee said in its report.
The Senate committee said that Sri Lanka is strategically positioned along key shipping lanes and emerging from decades of conflict.
The House Appropriations Committee has also passed its Foreign Appropriations Bill, but defers from that of its Senate Bill on Sri Lanka. Last week, during a Congressional hearing, lawmakers had expressed concern over massive cut in US aid to Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, US foreign assistance will be cut by 92 percent, mostly from accounts that have supported programmes to promote the rule of law, democratic reforms, post-war reconciliation and related efforts, rued Congressman Ted Yoho, Chairman of House Foreign Affairs Sub Committee on Asia and the Pacific.
These programmes are cost-effective ways to contribute to Sri Lankas transformation, while pursuing a partnership and strategic lead critical locations, he said.
Even at their height in 2016, US assistance commitments to Sri Lanka were about 42.5 million. PTI

US Major General calls for cooperation in India Ocean region for peace, prosperity
The Indian Ocean region occupies a position of immense strategic importance, said Major General James S Hartsell, Mobilization Assistant to Commander, U.S. Pacific Command.
Today, half the worlds container traffic, one-third of bulk cargo transport and nearly two-thirds of global maritime oil trade transits the waters of the Indian Ocean region.
The security implications attached to that level of commerce, therefore, are enormous, he said.
Major General Hartsell was speaking at the recent Indian Ocean Conference 2017 in Colombo, organized by the India Foundation.
He said that sitting astride major sea lines of communication, the Indian Ocean region necessarily attracts geostrategic interest both from states within and without; two of the three largest economies in the world, China and Japan, along with many other nations have vested interest in resources and trade that transit these waters, a condition which has potential for competition and cooperation between states.
Economies throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific continue to flourish because the collective respect for  and adherence to  international rules and standards, the Major General said.
These principles, which include freedom of navigation for military and civilian ships and aircraft, the peaceful resolution of disputes and unimpeded lawful commerce, provide the foundation of the rules-based international order that has lifted more than a billion people out of poverty and benefitted so many nations for the last seven decades. Many countries in this region, including India, have demonstrated a commitment to longstanding, customary international law. Importantly, the example is being set here in the Indian Ocean by actions as well as words, he said.
In 2014, the Permanent Court of Arbitration resolved a long-standing maritime border dispute between India and Bangladesh. At issue was the maritime border on Bangladeshs western border. In the Courts decision, Bangladesh was awarded eighty percent of its claimed exclusive economic zone. India chose to abide by the ruling, despite being the much larger and more powerful claimant. India is using its role as a regional leader to increase regional security and stability and to lay the foundation for cooperation on other issues.
Major General Hartsell said he wished to emphasize the value of cooperative, inclusive approaches to all affected nations in addressing some of the most pressing regional challenges.
Joint patrols, inclusive military exercises and sustained engagement enhances our ability to work together to combat maritime piracy, protect trade and shipping routes, deter terrorists, and provide humanitarian assistance during natural disasters. The United States will continue to look for ways that we can cooperate in these areas.
That is a message that resonates to all of us tasked with providing the security upon which continued stability and expanding prosperity depend, he said.

A Tale of Two Cities is a one-year long project that was conceptualised as a discursive, research-based art-making context that engaged eleven artists from India and Sri Lanka to respond to two sacred sites  Anuradhapura and Varanasi. The exhibition was both a reflection and record of a creative process that involved crossing borders and boundaries, questioning practice and approach and shape-shifting in order to absorb the journey through the living sacred.

Virginias mission and vision
Most of us who are readers of creative works, are familiar with the name Virginia Woolf (1888  1941) not so much as a trendsetter in English writing, but as the wife of the colonial administrator cum writer of the well known novel titled as A Village in the Jungle namely Leonard Woolf. But as I observe the name of Virginia is more known as a writer of fiction that changed the conventional patterns with special reference to the narrative technique of the stream of consciousness.
As far back as early sixties, I had the chance of reading a book titled as Virginia Woolf: Her art as a novelist written by Joan Bennett. A Cambrian scholar. There was a time when I read over and over again, the work with much interest. The work deals on almost all the works of Virginia, with a special emphasis on her narrative works like The Voyage Out (1915), Night and Day (1919), Jacobs Room (1922), Mrs Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), The Waves (1931), The Years (1937) and Between the Acts (1941).
Published posthumously
Followed by interpretations on these works, Joan Bennett goes on to other works that include various articles of interest written to periodicals and newspapers from time to time. Then the reader gets the chance to read the diary entries of Virginia titled as A Writers Diary written in 1953, which deals mainly on the creative process and personal glimpses. These works are published posthumously. In all, there are eight chapters.
In the introductory Chapter, Virginia Woolf is said to have stated in her collection of literary essays, The Common Reader, a statement that remains as her creative wisdom.
Our first task and it is often formidable enough is to master his (the writers) perspective. Until we know how the novelist orders his world, the ornaments of his world, which the critics press upon us, the adventures of the writer, to which biographers draw attention, are superfluous possessions of which we can make no use.
As the researcher Joan Bennett points out the terms such as formidable and perspective carry a multi-faceted panorama of meanings. As the researcher further points out, this is clearly depicted in her novels as she takes the basic principles of the novel as she finds them and adapts them to her own vision. Characters are described and tehn gradually made better known to us by their sayings and doings. They are related to one another by a series of events leading to a climax. Examples are drawn from her well known novels such as The Voyage Out, Night and Day, The Waves and Between the Acts.
Conventional forms
As Joan Bennett states, the basic task of Virginia Woolf had been to rediscover a new form of narrative as deviating from the more conventional forms of writings of either Arnold Bennett or John Galsworthy. As such, there are two courses. Firstly to understand the limitations of the conventional forms and secondly two introduce her own way of expression when she knew the best form is to utilise the sensitivity of expression via a psychological narrative form.
She preferred the forms of expressions as used by writers such as James Joyce and Marcel Proust. As a conclusive measure, Joan Bennett says that her novels are penetrated through and through with a sense of the strangeness of human life as though there were some other life guessed at, more ordered and significant of which men catch an occasional glimpse.
She needed to express her own peculiar feeling about things, events, people and places. In her own way, she had been nostalgic as far as abstractions permit. To express all this, she was impelled to invent for the creative force a form akin to poetic form Joan Bennetts work goes a step ahead in this analysis on characters and human beings in Chapter two. In this direction, the researcher takes three narratives: To the Lighthouse, The Waves and The Years.
Fullest expression
Virginia Woolf as a creative writer is shown as perceiving the variety of impressions made by one person upon the people round him and his own ever changing consciousness of the surrounding world. Re-reading Virginias works may be of use today to rediscover how characters portrayed have depth rather than width. This is observable in the particularly in the novel The Waves. Through the narrative which bears the fullest expression of the subjective aspect of her creative genius.
In it, the attention is wholly concentrated upon six people and the human experience is revealed from within their minds. In this novel, minor characters are very nearly non-existent. Joan Bennett too discusses some of the minor drawbacks of the creative flow of Virginia Woolf. As she states like most other novelists Woolf can only fully communicate the experience of a limited number of human types. Further Woolf also creates a limited range of intellectual and moral types.

Virginity for sale
Sex, is important, undoubtedly, as we had already mentioned in one of our earlier articles. But, it seems, that the desperation for sex has reached a whole new level in this case, where an 18-year-old Ukrainian student offered to sell her virginity.
The student said she will sell her virginity to a real man in a local newspaper, because she is in desperate need for 1,500.
According to a news published in The Daily Mail, Yulia, the teenager, told a paper in south east Ukraines Melitopol, 'Sooner or later I will have to say goodbye to it. So it is better to do it this way than at some drunken party.
Interestingly her advertisement named Virginity for Sale appears alongside those seeking buyers for alarm clocks, antiques and businesses.
The advert reads, Lovely girl, 18 years old, a student. Will give my virginity to a serious man who offers me financial assistance of 50,000 hryvnia (1,500). The meeting will take place in Melitopol only at a place of my choice.
The teenager went on to add that she needed the money for a good cause and not for entertainment or to waste. Candidates were told to call her on Skype.
According to the girl, she had boyfriends but kept her virginity.
The newspaper Torbinka said it was the first time they had carried an advertisement selling virginity.

West Indies look to recalled Gayle for ODI inspiration
Belfast: The recall of Chris Gayle to the West Indies ODI squad, for the first time since the 2015 World Cup, has dominated the countdown to the upcoming five-match series against England.
But Gayle -- one of the biggest draws in the game -- is likely to make his first appearance against Ireland on Wednesday.
Gayle arrived with the 15-man squad in Northern Ireland on Monday after the West Indies board announced an amnesty which has also seen the return of Marlon Samuels and Jerome Taylor.
Previously players had to be available for the corresponding domestic tournament before being selected for limited-overs internationals or Test cricket.
Samuels last played in October 2016, but was dropped for the tri-series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe the following month, but while Gayle played in the one-off T20 game against India in July, his next ODI will be his first since the 2015 World Cup.
Taylors last ODI was in July 2016.
The panel welcomes back Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, who will both add value to our batting and help with the nurturing of the young batsmen in the team, said chairman of selectors Courtney Browne. The selectors will also hope the experienced pair -- Samuels is 36 and Gayle celebrates his 38th birthday on the day of the second ODI against England next week -- can help West Indies qualify for the next World Cup.
But unless they beat Ireland and then win four of the five games against England they will find themselves in the qualifying tournament next March, along with Ireland, Afghanistan and hosts Zimbabwe.
Only two qualifiers will join the top eight in the rankings at the end of this month at the 2019 finals in England. After his selection, Gayle confirmed he wanted to play in the finals.
The fans were happy to see me back on the field representing West Indies, said Gayle.
Hopefully, things can get better. Hopefully I can play a few more games.
I definitely want to play the 2019 World Cup.
Things are beginning to open up a little more now between players and the board. Its looking good, and weve to try and build from this to get the best players out on the field.
Only six of the Test squad that has just completed the three-match series in England are staying on for the white-ball action - which also includes a one-off T20 against England on Saturday - but Roston Chase is the only player dropped from the squad that lost 3-1 to India in the home series in July.
If the weather allows -- and the West Indies arrived in Belfast in rain and more is forecast for the next 48 hours -- they should gain a morale-boosting win against the newest Full Member, who have failed to win any of their last nine games.
It is also the beginning of the end of John Bracewells two-year reign as Ireland coach. AFP

Why Eliya and Gota are wrong about post war reforms
The new kid on the block of the Rajapaksa return project is the supremely ill named Eliya meaning light organisation headed by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, whose stated intent is to oppose the proposed post war reforms of the Unity Government. At its recent launch with all the usual suspects of the Joint Opposition and their sundry cheer leaders in attendance, the arguments put forward were essentially the same old tired and hackneyed, fear mongering and paranoia which had been conclusively rejected by the people at two elections in January and August 2015. Essentially there is no new argument, no new shrill screams of paranoia which were not made in 2015, that are being made now.
After all, then candidate Sirisena was called a foreign agent, an NGO puppet, a Diaspora lackey and every other conceivable insult that self-induced paranoia could produce, but prevailed at the polls, despite actually spending a lot less, facing totally adverse state media coverage and arguably being the less flamboyant of the two candidates.
The voters did not forget and ignore, the gross mismanagement and rampant corruption which were the hallmarks of the Rajapaksa national security state.
Now clearly the JO, the Eliya and its fraternal SLPP all hope that come 2020, fear and thinly disguised racism are potent enough that with the passage of time, swing and new younger voters will forget or at least forgive, the worlds most expensive highways, Telecom regulatory funds spend on electioneering, empty ports and unused airports resulting in unsustainable commercial debts, the white van abductions, the killing of editors and journalists, sacking a chief justice and jailing the opposition presidential candidate, who is a war hero, to name a few of the features of Rajapaksa misrule, lest we forget.
However, the arguments made by Eliya are weak and require to be countered.
Firstly, the argument is made, that constitutional reforms will negate the war victory and provide through reforms what the LTTE were unable to win on the battlefield. The LTTE were not fighting for reforms. In fact, the LTTE opposed every attempt at reform, including the 13th Amendment to the constitution and the devolution of power to the provincial council.
Constitutional reforms
The LTTE was fighting for a mono ethnic separate state, which was neither democratic nor respected basic human rights. Which is why the LTTE killed Tamil political opponents and conscripted young Tamil children. The proposed constitutional reforms are not going to reduce democracy, human rights or enable the creation of a separate state. On the contrary, it will do the opposite. It will strengthen democracy and human rights, strengthen the social compact between the state and the governed while reducing the alienation of marginalized communities and especially ethnic minorities from the Sri Lankan state.
Secondly, a retired general and published author in attendance at the Eliya launch, according to media reports has stated that because he spent three decades fighting in the North, he rather than the communitys democratically elected leaders knew what the people wanted. One wondered if he fought the Tigers or dialogued with them. We presume the former. His comments move from the sublime to the ridiculous.
The Sri Lankan Army knew very well the alienation of the Tamil people from the Sri Lanka State.
That is why during the entire duration of the war, Tamil people from the North were not allowed to come out of the Jaffna peninsula and indeed the Vanni, without a special military pass. We never fought the JVP in 1989/90 confining people to their homes, but the only way to contain the war to the North and East and prevent it spreading to the rest of the country was to confine the people of the North and East, to their own areas. The fighting was ended but the causes of the conflict remain to be addressed.
Even a fairly cursory study of either history or political science would teach us, that the best way to have social cohesion and fidelity to a constitutional order is to ensure that there is no systematic alienation of people or groups of people from a State.
In that context, we need reforms of the Sri Lanka state, which ensures that the State accommodates the full diversity of her peoples. Reforms which address, what LTTE suicide bomb victim late MP, Dr. Neelan Tiruchelvam defined as the anomaly of having imposed a mono ethnic state on a multi-ethnic polity.
National anthem
No better example of the mono ethnic nature of the Sri Lankan State is needed than in the issue of the singing of the national anthem in both Sinhala and Tamil at the National Day celebrations and indeed the near hysteria of the Eliya mentality type persons who predicted dire consequences if it happened. The anthem is sung now in both languages and we are a stronger nation for it.
Reconciliation is a long-term process and progressively pursued by the Unity Government, strengthening social cohesiveness as it progresses, though admittedly slowly.
Finally, the arguments on constitutional reform are mixed up, rather illogically with issues of post war accountability. Illogical because real politic would most likely ensure that political reforms which are the best guarantors of non-recurrence would lessen not increase the pressure on accountability issues. However, the JO and indeed the Rajapaksa clan must remember that it was President Mahinda Rajapaksa who in May 2009, in a joint declaration with the then UN Secretary General pledged Sri Lanka to a post war process of accountability, a political solution and rehabilitation.
This position though often reiterated in international fora throughout the shortened Rajapaksa second term from 2010 to 2014, was not implemented in any way and the international community was only progressively requiring Sri Lanka to be true to her own commitments and international obligations. From a foreign policy standpoint, the Rajapaksa clans great error was to belittle and ignore their own international undertakings. In hind sight, it was the foreign policy acumen and course correction of the Unity Government which once again normalized Sri Lankas relations with the world.

Witness seeks CA order to probe Welikada shootings
The Court of Appeal yesterday re-fixed for support for October 17, a writ petition which sought an order directing the Inspector General of Police (IGP) and CID Director to commence an investigation into the Welikada prison riot in 2012 resulting in the death of 27 prisoners.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, counsel who appeared on behalf of the petitioner sought a further date to support the petition.
Sudesh Nandimal Silva who was in remand custody at the time the shooting took place had filed this writ petition.
He has cited Prisons Commissioner General,CID Director, Inspector General of Police, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister and the Attorney General as respondents.
Silva said he was seeking Court attention to what he saw and was within his personal knowledge of the said tragic incidents for the purpose of obtaining relief.
On November 9, 2012 at about 1.00 pm the petitioner and other prisoners at Welikada prison received information that Army and STF personnel were about to enter the prison to conduct a search operation. The petitioner got to know that here was an argument between prison officials and a contingent from the TID, STF waiting at the prison gates on the procedure related to the search operation.
Silva said the prison was in Army control until 10 am on November 10, 2012. By that time 27 prison inmates had been killed by STF, Army, TID and Prison Intelligence. The petitioner has made a complaint to the CID on February 2, 2015. The petitioner stated that although four years has lapsed since the killings, no action has yet been taken by the police or the Attorney General to conduct an investigation and prosecute the offenders.
This petition was filed through Senior Counsel K.S. Ratnavale and counsel Senaka Perera.

Wood Group and Amec merger plans approved by CMA
Regulators have accepted proposals by Wood Group and Amec Foster Wheeler to address competition concerns over their planned 2.2bn merger.
The firms have agreed to sell a range of assets after the Competition Markets Authority (CMA) found the merger could curb competition in the supply of services to the UK oil industry.
The companies were told they could face an in-depth investigation. Following public consultation, the CMA said the plan addressed its concerns.
Amec Foster Wheeler will now sell off "almost all" assets which contribute to engineering, construction and maintenance services in its upstream offshore oil and gas business in the UK.
Kate Collyer, deputy chief economic adviser at the CMA, said: "It is crucial that competition is maintained in this major UK industry.
"We have therefore conducted a thorough investigation into this merger, and believe that the sale of Amec Foster Wheeler's assets will address our concerns and ensure that customers in the North Sea continue to be able to obtain competitive bids."
She added: "The CMA is committed to conducting merger investigations as quickly and efficiently as possible.
"In this case, the CMA worked with the companies on a 'twin-track' approach, engaging with them on shaping remedies that might mitigate competition concerns, if any were found, whilst still investigating whether such concerns arose.
"This enabled us to promptly reach a final view on the proposed remedy after competition concerns were identified, helping to reduce uncertainty about the potential impact of the merger for customers within this industry."
Robin Watson, chief executive of Wood Group said: "Since we announced the deal in March, both parties have maintained a relentless focus on keeping on schedule.
"Today's earlier than anticipated decision from the CMA allows us to move forward with pace and we are very confident of completing the acquisition of Amec Foster Wheeler in October."
Jon Lewis, chief executive of Amec Foster Wheeler said: "We welcome today's announcement from the CMA.
The deal will create a company with a combined value of about 5bn. BBC News

Young revolution: St Peters College
Head Prefect Joshua Young of St. Peters is a man of many sides. He is a leader who does not recognize the word Impossible. Nothing deters him from achieving what he wants. He is open to the opinions of his Peterites, a hallmark of a successful leader. Perfect Prefects features Joshua Young an extremely progressive and liberal leader.
Young feels that a Head Prefect should be someone who is really forward and forward thinking as well. He correctly points out that one problem we have with our current society is that there are lots of people with opinions, but dont like to give them out. It is not only about leadership qualities says Young, but you have to be a person who boldly speaks his mind and applies what he does to the Prefect-ship.
Best action
In our Prefect Body, we get the opinions of everyone. When there is a difficulty the first thing I would do is ask the opinion of everyone inside the body  my senior, juniors and my stewards. I would get their opinion first. Then I and my deputies would get together and discuss and carry out the best action that we think. That is the game plan, explains Young
When Obama contested for the presidency many people thought it could not be done. But now America has had its first Black President. Nothing deterred Obama from carrying on with his policies when he was convinced that it was the correct plan of action. It is this tenacity that Young admires about Barack Obama. Even though there was a lot of controversies, he took it into his consideration but he had his own game plan. In the end, I think he brought America to a much better place. So for me, he is actually a good role model, said Young.
Young feels that most people have misunderstood the meaning of leader. They think he is a person who does whatever he wants to do. Indeed this is the characteristics of a despot. And we have seen many examples of leaders in our world who have been ruined because of their inability to handle their positions of power. Young aspires to a more democratic way of life as a leader. His ideas are very reminiscent of Athenian ideals of democracy.
Happy working
I have a system for getting others opinions, I am involved with people more junior to me. They are happy working with me rather than hating me and not liking my methods. Even though I say it is my methods, it is their opinions that apply to it. I have been in their place before. That is how I think and do things. That is why I think it works and it is easier for a person to follow a leader like that, pointed out Young.
Young stated that emotions can affect the way you think, and being humans we are emotional, but you need to face the facts in life. You need to make decisions based on those facts. As a Head Prefect, there are a lot of activities in school that you have to attend while doing your studies. You need to give a good example of yourself and there are a lot of pressures like that. So you cant start panicking and freaking out saying you cant do this.
We work to come to a place like this, we actually wanted something like this. Given that opportunity, you have to deal with it. So when there is pressure, instead of freaking out, I calm myself down and think what the problems are and face one problem at a time. The challenges are all one at a time. Finish off what is more important firstly and then deal with the rest, said Young.
Young has many ambitions. One is to do well as a Software Engineer and go to a very high place. Currently, he is doing Math for his A/Ls and aims at getting his degree.
Regardless of the circumstances, I somehow found a way to balance my studies and became Head Prefect somehow and that is not easy in an institution like this. To be honest, I really have not planned out my future that much, but becoming a Software Engineer is the basic idea, said Young.
Defeatist mentality
When asked as to what the biggest tragedy he felt the world had faced, Young pointed out that in his opinion it would be World War II. However, he pointed out that this tragedy could have been nipped in the bud. You need to deal with these tensions at the school and family level. World War II could have been prevented.
There is a certain defeatist mentality in society. People think that effecting change is beyond them. Change cannot be prevented but society is going in a direction that is distressing. There are so many problems like Gender based problems, poverty and crime.
We all have this dream in our head where we want to do something but we also think that as a single person we cant do enough. But there is enough evidence in society today where we find there are people who are making a change  child prodigies and young billionaires and a Black President. Problem is people think they cannot be someone like that. It is important to improve yourself and be a better version of yourself and then just let things happen, pointed out Young.
Being in most of the clubs, Young holds the editing positions. Being a member of the Interact Club, what he has gained from the club is the ability to socialize with people who come from different schools and different backgrounds.
I gather valuable knowledge from what my fellow club members have gone through. So I know what I am going to face in society. As a boys school we dont have that much exposure to international schools, by being in clubs like this we gain a lot of exposure, said Young.
Never give up
A bookworm when he was in Grade 6, 7 and 8 reading about five or six books a week, Young has an attitude and message that he wants to share with others. And that message is never to give up. People can tell you all kinds of things but you need to be determined. You cant throw in the towel.
I want to tell them not to be affected by other peoples opinions too much. People will discourage you. One word I dont like is impossible. I am a person who has proved people wrong. So I would like to tell you that nothing is impossible. When you want to achieve something, disregard the negativity of others. Take into consideration what those who are closest to you think. People who matter to you. When they encourage you to pursue your dreams then go for it. Another problem in our world is challenges faced by disabled people. My message to them is to never give up. When trying to make changes in society you can start small. Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg started small while being college dropouts. They wanted to start a company and now they have come to a big place. So start small. And someday you can do something big, summed up Young.
