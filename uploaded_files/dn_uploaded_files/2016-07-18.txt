Young Lions perform creditably against South African counterparts
Sri Lanka U19 Youth team under the captaincy of Avishka Fernando, a product of St.Sebastians, Moratuwa with a great future, finished their home series against visiting South Africa U19 with a slight edge over their opponents as they were able to force a win-less draw in the three-match Youth Test series whilst winning the following one-day series 2-1. Sri Lanka U19 after their triumph in the one-day series were awarded with the Gamini Dissanayake Challenge Trophy that was on offer for the champions of this series.
3-MATCH YOUTH TEST SERIES
As South African contingent was packed with a strong batting and a fast-bowling lineup; and they were a nation generally renowned for their Excellency on the field, Avishka and his team had a tough task especially ahead of the three-match Youth Test series. However, Lankans stubborn approach in the Test series denied South Africans of any chance whatsoever to dominate as many expected at the outset. Lankans played so well that they did not allow the visitors to come closer to a victory either in any of the three Test matches.
Individual outcomes of the Test series with four South African players, J van Heerden - 344 runs, R Vasconcelos - 256, PWA Mulder - 220, R van Tonder - 191 occupying the first five positions of the batting list proved that their batting was superior to the Sri Lankans. The only Sri Lankan batsman who could capture a place in the first five was Pathum Nissanka with 195 runs to his credit. However, Sri Lankans claimed the honour of scoring more centuries as Pathum NIssanka and Ashen Bandara scored two of the three centuries recorded in the series. In the bowling, Praveen Jayawickrama with 8 wickets topped Lankans bowling list and was second overall behind leader PWA Mulder of South Africa who bagged 12 wickets. Prashan Kumara (7 wickets) and Damitha Silva (6) also bowled well for Sri Lanka occupying the 4th and 5th spots of the overall bowling list.

3-MATCH ONE-DAY SERIES
Sri Lanka U19 and visiting South Africa U19, after both teams gained equal honours in the preceding Youth Test Series all three matches of which produced no results, used the following three-match one-day series to gain the supremacy over each other as the shorter format was always results-oriented.
South Africa U19 set the tone for their early dominance in the series when they sneaked to a narrow 16-run win in the series opener with the help of their bowlers who well defending their meagre total bowled out the home team with 16 runs short of the target of 186 to take 1-0 lead in the three-match series. South Africa needing just a win to secure the series came into the second match with their tails up, but Sri Lanka came-back very strongly to win rain-affected second match by 12 runs on D/L method and level the series.
Sri Lanka skipper, Avishka Fernandos 115-ball 97 with 11 fours and two sixes helped the home team stay ahead of D/L target when play ended in the 48th over. As the two teams had one win each after the first two encounters, the third and final match became the decider. South Africans score of 195 after they elected to bat on winning the toss in the final match was made easily accessible by Sammu Ashan and Ashen Bandara who in a dramatic 100-run partnership unfinished for the fifth wicket claimed an eight-wicket win in the decisive third one-dayer, thereby sealing series 2-1.
Skippers of two sides, Avishka Fernando of Sri Lanka and Wiaan Mulder of South Africa topped the series batting list with Avishka collecting 130 runs at 43 and Mulder 107 at 36. Ashen Bandara and Sammu Ashan of Sri Lanka with 83 and 75 runs to their credit occupied the third and fourth places of the batting list whilst South African, R van Tonder came fifth with 74 runs. In the bowling, Damitha Silva had a tally of 9 wickets to lead the table whilst WD Sendin of South Africa capturing 7 wickets and Praveen Jayawickrama of Sri Lanka with 6 wickets occupied the next two spots.

A BRIEF DESCRIPION OF THE FINAL ONE-DAYER
South Africa U19 in this decisive third and final one-dayer with both teams having a win each from the first two contests decided to bat first on a good batting track at the SSC, but their slower approach at the outset did not help their cause in this crucial game.
South Africans needed more than 30 overs to put their 100 on the board though they had enough wickets in hand to do the acceleration. Despite No.2 batsman, Wandile Makwedu scored his 26 at a reasonable pace, Raynard van Tonder and skipper Wiaan Mulder used 172 balls to contribute just 96 runs between the two at less than four runs per over though the pair rebuilt their innings with a useful 70-run stand for the fourth wicket.
However, Eathan Boschs 26-ball 20 and Kennan Smiths 15-ball 20 in a late cameo carried South Africans final total closer to two hundred before they finally reached 195 for nine in their allotted 50 overs, a total looked to be reasonable compared to the sedate way they started their innings though it was not a challenging total in the conditions. Damitha Silva and Sammu Ashan shared a good seven wickets between them whilst Ayana Siriwarshana and Praveen Jayawickrama bowled their 10-over spells quite economically keeping South African batsmen at bay.
Lankans got off to a reasonable start, though they lost opener Pathum Nissanka cheaply, with the help of Shanogeeths anchor innings. Avishka Fernando and Mishen Silva both got a start but could not hang on. However, after Shanogeeth departed for a well accomplished 41, Sammu Ashan and Ashen Bandara easily combating the tricky conditions with smart batting deprived South Africans of making a comeback in order to defend their meagre total. The pair put on a century-stand for the unfinished fifth wicket to secure Lankans victory by 6 wickets with 25 balls remaining. Sammu Ashan getting back to his usual rhythm at the right time remained 70 not out from 103 balls with 4 fours and a six whilst Ashen Bandara finished with an unbeaten 37.
South Africa U19: 195-9 in 50 overs (Wiaan Mulder 59, Raynard van Tonder 37, Damitha Silva 4/48, Shammu Ashan 3/38)
Sri Lanka U19: 199-4 in 45.5 overs (Shammu Ashan 70*, S Shanogeeth 41, Ashen Bandara 37*, WD Sendin 2/33, PWA Mulder 2/32)

JVP Leader expresses concern about  university students
Instead of fostering higher education, the Minister of Higher Education today is discharging his duties in a similar manner to that of a Minister of Prisons, Janatha Vimukthui Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Dissanayake said yesterday.
H was speaking at a media briefing at the JVP head office in Pelawatta.
Expressing his reservations and concerns to the government about the recent arrests and class suspensions of university students, Dissanayake asked if the present government had taken after the previous Rajapaksa regime- it seemed that actions to suppress student demonstrations are all out.
He said, up to this date, 28 students have been taken before Court and 26 students have been suspended from the Sabaragamuwa University- 19 arrested and 24 taken before Court from the Kelaniya University, three arrested and five taken before Court from the Ruhuna University.
The classes of 25 students attached to the Moratuwa University, 29 attached to the Peradeniya University and 35 attached to the HNDA, have been suspended by the higher educations top brass, he said, Furthermore, the convener of the Inter University Students Federation has been put behind bars.
The JVP Leader also cautioned the government of the possibility that current student protests can turn into public protests.
He said the government is making education a luxury of the rich and privileged. Its policy is to make education a crop to be yielded by the rich instead of making it a privilege of the entire student population which is to be yielded on an equal footing.
The issues over the Malabe private medical school, SAITM stands as a good example.The students have opposed it and they are fighting against it. The SAITM Mudalali (entrepreneur) is in no position to sell education which is the sum total of experience of mankind throughout the ages as if it was his property, he said.
Where the government needed to change its policy regarding education, it appears that it has passed the ball to the Court, This has led to a situation of students being stranded, they have been left hopeless on the future of their education and rights, ready to spend sleepless nights opposite the Fort Railway Station, he said.
The government is responsible for their plight he added.

Amir seals Pakistans 75 run-win over  England in first Test

LONDON, SUNDAY: Mohammad Amir completed his return to Test cricket by taking the final wicket of the match as Pakistan beat England by 75 runs on the fourth day of their series opener at Lords on Sunday.
England, set 283 for victory, were bowled out for 207 after tea on the fourth day.
Leg-spinner Yasir Shah took four for 69 for a match haul of 10 for 141 in his first Test outside of Asia and the United Arab Emirates.
Left-arm quick Amir, at the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime, ended the match when he bowled last man Jake Ball.
Victory saw Pakistan go 1-0 up in the four-match series ahead of the second Test at Old Trafford starting on Friday.
At tea England were 155 for six needing a further 128 runs to reach their victory target of 283.
The most England had ever made before to win in the fourth innings of a Lords Test was 282 for three against New Zealand in 2004.
England were making steady progress at 135 for four when leg-spinner Shah, who took six for 72 in the first innings, struck Sunday.
A ball after Gary Ballance had pulled him for four, Shah bowled the recalled left-hander behind his legs for 43 with a delivery that spun out of the rough. Moeen Ali (two) then charged down the pitch in an attempt to drive Shah, only to be bowled between bat and pad by a well-flighted delivery.
Shah had taken two wickets for two runs in six balls and England were 139 for six.
Rahat treble
Earlier, Pakistans Rahat Ali removed Englands top three batsmen in a breathless pre-lunch session that saw the hosts score 90 runs in 22 overs.
England captain Alastair Cook launched the chase with a four off the very first ball of the innings when he cut a loose Mohammad Amir delivery to the boundary.
All the pre-match focus had been on Amir, making his return to Test cricket at the scene of his 2010 spot-fixing crime.
But it was fellow left-arm quick Rahat who stunned England.
His back-off-a-length ball had left-hander Cook (eight) edging through to wicket-keeper Sarfraz Ahmed.
Cooks opening partner Alex Hales made a brisk 16 before carelessly chasing a wide ball from Rahat outside off stump, with Mohammad Hafeez holding a good catch at first slip.
Joe Root, Englands new number three, struck two superb cover-driven fours off Rahat -- one of the back foot and the other the front.
But the star batsman fell into a hooking trap on nine when he paddled a Rahat short ball to Shah, set back at deep square leg.
James Vince too got off the mark with a cover-driven four off Rahat.
Vince was on nine when his edged drive off Rahat flew to Younis Khan only for the second slip to drop both the initial low catch and the rebound.
Vince struck nine fours, mainly through the offside, on his way to a Test-best 41 not out at lunch without looking assured.
It seemed he might give a catch in the slips at any moment and he did so again early in the second session.
Vince added just one run to his lunch score when, not moving his feet, he edged a booming drive of a Wahab Riaz delivery that moved away to second slip Younis, who this time clung on at the second attempt. Earlier, Pakistan added just one run to their overnight 214 for eight.
Pace bowler Woakes led England off the field after taking five for 32 for a match haul of 11 for 102. AFP

Muralitharan and  Australia bury the hatchet

Muthiah Muralitharan firmly believes that one must not carry grudges in life. How else does not explain the fact that the worlds highest Test wicket-taker, who endured a stormy relationship with Australian cricket throughout his career over chucking allegations, has now gone on to become a spin consultant Down Under The 44-year-old helped the Aussies out in 2014 before a series against Pakistan and is now offering his services in the build-up to a Test series against Sri Lanka.
I never had a problem with the Australian cricket board, players, or their people in general. It was just one or two individuals who made this accusation that I throw the ball, and I proved them wrong. Youve got to move on in life. If you carry grudges, you spoil your present and future. At the end of the day, Im a professional, Muralitharan told TOI on Saturday.
The animosity started with the legendary off-spinner being called twice by Australian umpire Darrel Hair during the Melbourne Test in 1995-96. Later, during the tri-series, Murali suffered again at the hands of another Aussie umpire, Ross Emerson. It led to the entire Sri Lankan team, then led by skipper Arjuna Ranatunga, rallying behind the spinner in a symbol of Asian crickets resistance against crickets western bloc.
A few years down the line, Australian Prime Minister John Howard openly accused Muralitharan of throwing the ball.
That the hatchet has been buried can be gauged from the fact it was Australian coach Darren Lehmann - who played in the era when Muralitharan wasnt exactly his countrys best friend -who keeps seeking the Lankan greats help.
Like most of the Australian cricketers of my era, Ive a long relationship with him too. Its also the media which makes the things difficult. As I said, past is past. If you think about it, you cant go into the future, chuckled the retired tweaker. TNN
