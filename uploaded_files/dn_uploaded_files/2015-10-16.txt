ACHC requests President to release Tamil political prisoners
The All Ceylon Hindu Congress (ACHC) in a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday requested to release Tamil political prisoners languishing in jails.
The Congress appealed to the President to do justice to these prisoners by releasing them during the Navaraththri period.
"All Hindus will appreciate if Your Excellency's government can arrange for the release of all prisoners before Deepavali," the letter stated.
The Congress said that it made a similar appeal to the President in January this year.
"We urge that the Hindu Priests be shown clemency together with other prisoners who are also entitled to justice and fair treatment"
Excerpts from the letter: " A Hindu Priest has been sentenced to jail, despite his plea that he was forced to make a confession under duress. In that connection, we annex hereto a copy of the report given by the J.M.O dated June 10, 2002 which details how he was allegedly assaulted and humiliated while in custody.
"Another Hindu Priest is to face trial and he too claims that he was forced to make a confession under duress".
"We urge that the Hindu Priests should be shown clemency while the other prisoners are also entitled to justice and fair treatment". "During this holy period of Navaraththri we appeal to Your Excellency to do justice by these prisoners," the letter adds.

Professor A. V. Suraweera:
A great scholar
Prof. A. V. Suraweera was one of the greatest scholars who rendered an immense service in Sri Lanka in the 20th century. Among the great literary scholars, Professor Suraweera's name shines brilliantly in the field of Sinhala literature.
He was born to a middle class family in a small village known as Korase near Udugampola in the Gampaha district. He was the eldest in a family of five brothers and two sisters. He received his secondary education at Gampaha Government English school. He had shown his scholarly talents even in his young age.
I remember my father speaking proudly of him when he got double promotions every other year. After passing the Senior School Certificate (SSC), he was lucky to gain admission to Royal College. During that period, most Royalists were from affluent families. It was rarely that a child from a remote village entered Royal College.
My parents were not very rich. We had financial difficulties. But my father, being an educated and intelligent person, realizing the value of education, left aside all prospective avenues of money making and spent everything he had on the children's education.
My mother always encouraged this great endeavour. Not only that, he encouraged other parents also to provide their children a sound education. As a result, the poor village named Korase, was lucky to produce doctors, engineers, government servants and teachers in a short period.
Suraweera passed his university entrance examination in 1950 and entered the University of Ceylon, Colombo. In 1952, he shifted to Peradeniya University with the first batch of students. Close association of great scholars in Sri Lankan history such as Prof. D. E. Hettiarachchi, Prof. Gunapala Malalasekera, Dr. Saratchandra and Prof Paranavitana must have helped him in his literary success in later life.
He obtained his BA (Hons) and MA Degrees from Peradeniya University. After five years of teaching at Sri Rahula Vidyalaya, Katugastota, St Joseph's College, Colombo and Ananda College Colombo, he joined Sri Jayawardenepura University in 1961 as a lecturer.
During his university career he spent his first sabbatical year of leave on an Asia Foundation grant at the University of Iowa, USA.
The second at the University of Canterbury, UK on a Full-bright scholarship and finally as a guest professor of Sinhala and Cultural Studies at the SOAS London University.
In 1964, he passed his PhD examination. At the university, he served as Head of Department of Sinhala for 20 years and as Dean of the Faculty of Arts in addition to other responsibilities. He founded the prestigious program, 'Writership and Communication' and served as the first director.
Being a versatile writer both in Sinhala and English he contributed over 60 books on Literature, Culture, History and critical editions of classical texts. He wrote a number of novels, translations, short stories, children's books and numerous scholarly articles.
In 1994, he resigned from the Jayawardenepura University as the Senior Professor of Sinhala after 35 years of service to contest the general elections. He was elected to Parliament and he held the post of Deputy Minister of Cultural Affairs for six years, successfully. In recognition of his exceptional literary and cultural achievements, he was awarded the Degree of Dlit (Honours Causa) title of Emeritus Professor by the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, the Presidential National Honour 'Kalakeerthi' and the state literary award 'Sahitya Ratna'.
He served as Director General of the Central Cultural Fund for two years and as Chairman of the National Education Commission for seven years.
He was the Chancellor of the Rajarata University until his demise.
He was 'Lokuputa' to his parents, 'Loku Ayya' to his brothers and sisters, 'Loku Mama' and 'Loku Thatta' to his sons and daughters, 'Loku Seeya' to his grand children and 'Mahacharya' to the whole world.
He was an honest, ardent and true Buddhist who lived according to the teachings of the Buddha. He was kind, loving, simple and honest.
Hatred, ill will and jealously were not in his thoughtful mind.
His demise is an irreparable loss not only to family members but also to the educated society. But even with uncontrollable grief and sorrow, we should admit that life is uncertain and death is certain. He lived peacefully and passed away peacefully.
May he attain the eternal bliss of Nirvana.

Lionel Mendis:
Unforgettable 'sir'
It is with profound sadness I pay tribute to this fine gentleman, coach and inspirational guru to his students, Lionel Mendis.
I recall the fond memories at our Alma Mater - Ananda College and a few individuals who went the extra mile beyond books and studies to instill qualities and moral values in us and molding us to be good human beings.
Our late Principal were Col. G. W. Rajapakse, Lionel Mendis, Eddison Silva, Bandula Galappatti, Tilak Wijesuriya, Ven. Habarakada Indraratne Thera, Ven. Kahatuduwe Hemasiri Thera, Ven. Divyagaha Yasassi Thera to name a few. To date, I firmly believe they had a tremendous influence in our lives and that period was the golden era of our Alma Mater.
I was only an average member of the cricket pool in the different age groups but what Mendis taught and instilled in us was not only cricket. It went leaps and bounds beyond. To be honest and fair, how to dress smartly and walk straight with the chest forward, to share and care for others, to have pride and self respect were some of the things he taught.
I still remember how Mendis used to stand in front of the Shrine Room during daily assembly, immaculately dressed either in white or off white, swede shoes and sporting a copper bangle. He paid attention to minute detail so much so to have the maroon caps with the Ananda crest in the identical colour and boots with special emphasis on crape souls, sweaters etc. He was very particular as to how the team would go out to the field in rows: Captain followed by the Vice Captain, then the players in rows and the keeper. He believed in class and uniformity in everything.
During net practices in 'galoya' (far end of Ananda), he would take the bat to demonstrate the correct way of playing a stroke and get a good bowler to bowl at him and would instruct where to pitch the ball too. For whatever reason if the bowler is able to take his wicket, he would insist that the ball was pitched at the wrong spot creating amusement and laughter in silence among ourselves.
This highly respected coach sacrificed his whole life to cricket and produced some of the finest cricketers Sri Lanka had ever seen in the likes of the stylish and technically perfect opener Charith Senanayake, 1996 World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunge and Brendon Kuruppu to name just a few of the never ending list.
He had been felicitated a few days before his demise and I am more than certain it would have given him a great sense of satisfaction, knowing his commitment and effort was recognized and appreciated.
On behalf of all his students, I sincerely thank the organizers for this noble and timely deed.
I personally know that Anandians scattered the world over are mourning his demise in silence and I for one decided to pen my thoughts of our beloved sir, as the guilt of not keeping in touch with him and not even being able to pay him my last respects, would not have left me for the rest of my life.
We cannot repay you sir for the yeomen service rendered towards Ananda Cricket and for inculcating true values in your students.
You will be fondly remembered by all of us always.
May you attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana, our beloved sir.

Rice off the menu
Asia's hunger for bread and pastries boosts wheat demand
SOUTH KOREA: Asia is losing some of its appetite for rice in favour of wheat, a trend that is nowhere more pronounced than South Korea where bread and pastries have become a new staple.
From working mothers, who find toast more convenient to prepare for breakfast, to city dwellers flocking to new eateries for baguettes, South Koreans are at the forefront of an Asia-wide trend that has seen wheat demand climb at nearly twice the rate of rice consumption since 2008.
And while Asia is largely self sufficient in rice, demand for bread and noodles from Mumbai to Manila has made Asia the largest and fastest growing market for wheat imports, shipping in more than 40 million tonnes annually for the past five years or 25 percent of world imports.
"I eat bread with coffee almost every morning," said Lee Seung-Hee, a 47-year-old working mother of two, who often gives her children bread as a snack between meals.
"My husband likes to have rice meals, so I try to cook rice for him. But when I'm too busy, I just give him bread."
South Koreans spent an estimated 6.36 trillion won ($5.37 billion) last year on bread, sandwiches, bagels and pastries, according to SPC Group, owner of the Paris Croissant and Paris Baguette chains, which has even opened two stores in Paris as part of global expansion.
Meanwhile, South Korea's rice consumption hit a record low of 65.1 kg per person last year, while flour consumption was the highest since 2006 at 33.6 kg, according to industry and official data.
"Housewives are increasingly having bread and coffee for brunch late morning instead of rice and kimchi," said Kang Byung-Oh, a business professor at Chung-Ang University, referring to the spicy local side dish.
SPC Group, which runs Asia's biggest bread making plant and has about 5,000 bakeries in South Korea, said the local bread market has grown at an average of 15 per cent per year since 2005.
"You can find this trend across Asia, as Asian countries become westernised...Food products from wheat flour are quick, convenient," said Koh Hee-Jong, an agriculture and life science professor at Seoul National University.
Rising wheat consumption has been focused on large cities where an emerging middle class is exposed to a proliferation of convenience foods from pizzas to sandwiches. In Indonesia, noodle consumption has helped increase wheat demand in the world's second-biggest importer by more than 60 per cent since 2005 to nearly 8 million tonnes annually.
Even in India, the world's second-largest wheat grower, consumption is projected to surpass output by more than 5 million tonnes this year, sparking the largest imports in eight years. Wheat demand is especially strong in the North India, but is rising in the south where naan bread and chapattis vie with traditional rice consumption. Bangladesh is expected to import around 3 million tonnes of wheat a year to help meet 4 million tonnes of local demand.
"We used to take rice three times a day. Now we are taking rice only once a day," said Humayra Ahmed, a bank employee and mother of two children in Dhaka.
China has also seen wheat demand soar and consumed a record 118 million tonnes in 2014.
Along with record pizza sales and noodle consumption, demand for cakes and pastries is also increasing.
"It's a symbol of lifestyle, consumers pair them (cakes and pastries) with coffee and chatting, and hanging out with friends," said Linda Li, senior research analyst at Mintel China. With wheat production relatively low in some Asian countries - South Korea only produces about 1-2 per cent of its consumption - there is little alternative but to import more.
Australia, Russia, Ukraine, Canada, the United States and Europe have been the chief beneficiaries of Asian wheat demand, seeing collective exports swell by over 40 per cent since 2005.
But the relentless climb in wheat consumption does place a strain on exporters in places such as Australia to keep up.
"When you look at wheat consumption, it is to a very large degree driven by general increase in consumption as well as swap out of rice and other staples," said Ole Houe, an analyst at brokerage IKON Commodities in Sydney.

Djokovic ticks on as Tomic bombs
Novak Djokovic eased into the Shanghai Masters semi-finals on Friday after a brilliant start by Bernard Tomic fizzled into one of the Australian's trademark damp squibs.
Top-ranked Djokovic was pushed all the way in a thrilling opener but after he edged the tiebreak 8/6, it was plain sailing as Tomic capitulated 7-6 (8/6), 6-1.
The two swapped breaks early in the first set and with 20th-ranked Tomic standing up to Djokovic in the rallies, they were inseparable heading into the tiebreak.
But Tomic's head dropped after he limply netted on his opponent's third set point and he was broken three times in a car-crash of a second set before double-faulting on match point.
The 23-year-old has a reputation for quick losses which once saw him dubbed Tomic the tank engine. Last year he set an unwanted record for the fastest recorded defeat in men's tennis, losing 6-0, 6-1 to Jarkko Nieminen in 28 minutes 20 seconds in Miami.
Earlier, Rafael Nadal's renaissance took a big step forward as he whipped a flagging Stan Wawrinka for the loss of just three games to reach the semi-finals.
Nadal beat the world number four 6-2, 6-1 to bring up his first win over a top-five player in more than a year and extend a hot streak after he also reached last week's China Open final.
- Not 100 percent - SUB HEAD
Spain's Nadal was on court for just 64 minutes against Wawrinka, who said he was feeling the effects of his marathon three-setter against Marin Cilic late the previous night.
The French Open champion from Switzerland, who won last week in Tokyo, made 34 unforced errors and was on target with just 45 percent of his first serves as he folded meekly.
For sure physically I feel the effect of last night, but also the past 10 days. I've been playing a lot, winning Tokyo, Wawrinka said.
Today I was just struggling a little bit. It's that simple. Against Nadal you cannot do anything if you're not 100 percent.
Nadal will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the last four as he bids to keep up his record of winning at least one Masters title every season since 2005. More importantly, hours of extra work on the practice court look to be paying off as after a tough year, Nadal looks to recapture the form that brought him 14 Grand Slam titles.
Being in the semi-finals is a great result for me. I didn't play any semi-finals on hard court this year, now I am playing (them) two weeks in a row, he said.
That's a big improvement for me. In terms of confidence, in terms of the level of tennis, I am playing better. Very happy for that because I am working so hard.
Earlier Tsonga laboured to a three-set win over big-serving South African Kevin Anderson, 7-6 (8/6), 5-7, 6-4 to go into the semi-final with Nadal. Djokovic, seeking his ninth title of the year, will face either second-ranked Andy Murray or Tomas Berdych who were playing each other in the late match. AFP

Dozens of major websites crash all at once
US: Dozens of major websites including Netflix, Uber and the BBC went down simultaneously on Thursday in some areas of the United States, but were soon up again in most cases.
The cause of the crashes remained unclear, but some appeared connected to trouble at a cloud service relied on by companies, although that did not stop the social media rumor and conspiracy mill from going into overdrive.
"We're aware that members are experiencing issues streaming on all devices," streaming television service Netflix said in a tweet at its customer service Twitter account.
"We're working to resolve the problem."
Netflix spokesman Joris Evers told AFP that the outage was the result of "technical issues" at an UltraDNS cloud service provided by Neustar and affected mostly US subscribers.
"UltraDNS is working to address the issue," Evers said. "We apologize for the inconvenience."
Neustar confirmed in a tweet that there was an issue with its UltraDNS.
Internet trouble tracker CurrentlyDown.com displayed a list of two dozen websites that were or had been out of service during the day.
The list also included Ameritrade -- an online broker -- and The Economist.
It was unclear whether all those affected relied on UltraDNS, but ride-sharing service Uber blamed its problems on that.
The outages sparked chatter at Twitter and other social networks.
"Netflix, HBOGo, Chase Bank, Uber, ETrade... all websites down at the same time," tweeted Joseph Colarusso from the Twitter account @jcolarusso.
"Coincidence or Cyber Attack"
The UltraDNS service was hit by an outage affecting customers in the eastern United States late afternoon local time, according to Neustar spokeswoman Lara Wyss.
"We can confirm this is not a DDoS attack," Wyss told AFP, referring to a style of cyber attack in which websites are intentionally overloaded with requests for service and crash under the stress.
Most of the websites that stumbled or fell were back up and running by mid-evening East Coast time, according to CurrentlyDown.
"Some of our clients experienced sporadic difficulty accessing some of our websites," Ameritrade told AFP.
"Once clients were able to log in there were no issues."
Netflix also noted that the UltraDNS did not hurt the entire service, just some people trying to tune in.
Cloud-based DNS services essentially route traffic to websites.
"It's kind of a road map," said Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group.
"The roads are still in place, but if the map goes away nobody knows where to go."
The economics of running large-scale online services, such as streaming television shows or summoning car rides using smartphone applications, has given rise to companies that work in the background to handle traffic, storage and other needs.
Such cloud service providers often compete on price, meaning compromises might be made when it comes to quality of hardware or even levels of security, according to Enderle.
Since datacenters or servers handle demands from multiple clients, a hardware failure or software glitch can knock out seemingly unrelated Internet operations.
"The problem with a cloud service is you can't be certain a failure will be isolated," Enderle said.
"You've got this potential for cascading catastrophe."

Elections Commissioner has violated provisions of PC Ordinance
The Elections Commissioner has violated the provisions of the Provincial Council Ordinance by putting off Provincial Council Elections, said Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Secretary General and Parliamentarian Udaya Prabath Gammanpila.
He stated that public representation has been placed under an official by the act of placing Provincial Councils under Commissioners.
He made these observations yesterday at a press conference held at the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya head office.
MP Gammanpila further stated that the present government is attempting to postpone provincial council elections. He added that according to the provisions of the Provincial Council Ordinance, the Provincial Council election had to be held six months before the completion of the members' terms. He said that the term of Provincial Councils ended on October 16, adding that nominations have to be called immediately after the term ended, but there had been no such arrangements initiated by the government. He also said that by such delay, the Elections Commissioner had neglected his duties.
Gammanpila further stated that a commissioner is not allowed to use the powers of a mayor except for three reasons. He said by using the powers of mayors, commissioners could be brought before Court.
He also said that the the President as well as the Chief Opposition Whip in Parliament are "Swans."
He added the Chief Opposition Whip had no other topic other than the issue concerning Indian fishermen.
He said that the Opposition Leader had so far not raised any issue other than that of the North and East.
He further said that even the late UNP President J. R. Jayewardene did not attempt to take over the powers of the Opposition. He said the UNP is at present attempting to do so.

The evidence given before the COPE Subcommittee to look into the controversy surrounding the Central Bank Treasury bond issue was treated as confidential, Parliament Assistant Secretary General Kushani Rohanadeera said.
Speaking to the Daily News, she said the information revealed during the COPE Subcommittee Sittings and the people who gave evidence before it were not divulged to any outside party as its report did not come out officially.
"There was no official report, but only a draft. The content of it remains secret until it is tabled before the House. According to the Parliamentary Privileges Act, all documents and oral witnesses given before a Committee can not be revealed unless an official report comes out," she said.
However, she did not rule out the chance of certain information pertaining to it leaking out, stating that it was all beyond their control.
Meanwhile, it was reported that Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake had informed the Government that no information pertaining to the sittings of the Subcommittee was given to any external party.
He had made this observation following an inquiry by the Government. The Government has initiated the inquiry following the charge levelled by UPFA Opposition MPs that the Central Bank Officers, who had given evidence before the COPE Subcommittee, had been transferred.

A Fundamental Rights violation petition filed by Former Parliamentarian Somaweera Chandrasiri challenging the UPFA National List appointments to Parliament, was yesterday re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court. The petition is to be taken up again on October 23.
When the petition came up before Supreme Court Justices Eva Wanasundara, Upali Abeyratne and Anil Gunaratne, the Deputy Solicitor General who appeared for the Attotney General, moved for a further date.

The petitioner stated that the UPFA is an alliance of five political parties namely the MEP, DVJP, SLMP, SLFP and EPDP and that at its inception said the Alliance was functioning in a transparent and democratic manner, while all decisions were taken and all appointments were made with the consensus of all constituent parties.
The petitioner stated that Susil Premajayantha in his capacity as Secretary of the said Alliance, submitted a list of names, including the Petitioners' for the National List. He alleged that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala was subsequently appointed as General Secretary of the UPFA by the incumbent President, without consulting the other parties of the UPFA.
He stated that Prof. Vishwa Warnapala later submitted another set of names for the National List with names of some persons who were defeated at the elections and thereby constitutionally rejected and refused by the people as unqualified to be Members of Parliament. The petitioner said he was seeking the assistance of Court for a declaration that he was entitled to be nominated as qualified to be elected as a member of Parliament, submitted according to the 1st list.
He is also seeking the assistance of Court to cancel and/or quash the declaration made by the Elections Commissioner to the effect that persons in the second list are qualified to be elected as Members of Parliament.

IGP told to cooperate with AG
Court of Appeal Justice (President) Vijith K. Malalgoda yesterday directed IGP N.K. Ilangakoon to cooperate with the Attorney General whenever police officers were noticed to appear before Court.
Justice Malalgoda made this directive when the four Habeas Corpus petitions filed by wives of four Army intelligence officers arrested and detained in connection with the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda were taken up for hearing before the Court of Appeal yesterday.
The Court also ordered the respondents to file objection on November 19.
At a previous occasion too, court re-issued notices on four respondents including the IGP to appear before Court to show cause as to why they did not appear before court.
Meanwhile, Counsel Chishmal Warnasuriya appearing on behalf of the family members of Ekneligoda requested that Sandya Ekaneligoda be permitted to intervene into the petitions. The Court observed that this application would be considered to support on the next date. In the petitions, four wives of the detained Army intelligence officers - N. Sudharshi, P.N. Samanthi, L.D. Jayasekara and M. Karunaratne sought an order directing the respondents to produce their detained husbands in court and release them.
The petitioners stated the respondents had made arrangements and had obtained a Detention Order to detain Corporal Anura Jayalath, Staff Sergeant R.M. Priyantha, Lt. Colonel S.A. Kumararatne and Lt. T.T. Prabodha under section 9(1) of the Prevention of Terrorism Act No. 48 of 1979.
The petitioners stated that Ekneligoda had gone missing since 2010. They stated that in 2010, a Habeas Corpus application had been filed in the Court of Appeal and directed the Homagama magistrate to expedite an inquiry in this regard.
The petitioner stated that a copy of the detention order has not been furnished up to now.
They further stated that the initial detention order issued on August 27, 2015 lapsed on September 10 2015 and the petitioner stated that they learnt that a further detention order has been issued by the Defence Ministry Secretary detaining the Army personnel for a further period of 14 days.
They stated that the arrest of their husbands allegedly for purported involvement regarding the incident pertaining to Eknaligoda is illegal, unlawful, contrary to law, wrong, erroneous and bad in law in as much the evidence in MC Homagama does not reflect any incriminatory material against the detainees.
They alleged that the arrest of the army personnel is contrary to law and that in arresting them for an offence under the PTA, the first and second respondents have violated and infringed the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to them under Article 13(1) of the constitution.
They stated that the Army personnel were not produced within 24 hours of their arrest before a Magistrate and they continue to be in detention up to date.
They pleaded that in view of the fact that the allegations contained in this application clearly demonstrate a prima facia infringement of articles 12(1), 12(2), 13(1), 13(2) of the constitution relating to the detainees and refer this application for determination by the Supreme Court.

## Title: India's 'Look West' Maritime Diplomacy
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, October 16, 2015 - 19:30
India's 'Look West' Maritime Diplomacy
India's maritime diplomacy is most often associated with its naval outreach to East Asia. With an increase in naval ship visits to South East Asia in recent years, and attendant media speculation over New Delhi's supposed Pacific ambitions, the impression has been created that East Asia remains the ultimate destination of the Indian Navy's diplomatic endeavours.
By contrast, New Delhi's nautical diplomacy in the Indian Ocean has seemed relatively modest. Despite its considerable contribution to sea-lanes security and counter-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia, in the popular imagination, the Indian Navy's security efforts in the Indian Ocean region have remained confined to the level of constabulary and benign presence.
Developments in the past few months, however, have shown that India's attention remains squarely focused on the Indian Ocean. Since February this year, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Sri Lanka, Seychelles and Mauritius, making it clear the Indian Ocean littorals remained India's top priority, New Delhi has actively nurtured relationships with its maritime neighbours. Having improved the texture of its diplomatic ties, India has also sought to undertake joint developmental projects and strengthen a maritime security trilateral with Sri Lanka and Maldives through the inclusion of Seychelles.
New Delhi's maritime diplomatic efforts haven't remained limited to the cultivation of political relationships. In April this year, the Indian Navy scored one of its biggest diplomatic successes when it evacuated over 4000 Indians and 900 foreign nationals from war-torn Yemen. Operation Rahat was seen as a credible illustration of the India's maritime peacekeeping and benign potential, more so because it was conducted amid an active conflict, amidst an unfolding humanitarian catastrophe.
The most significant dimension of India's Indian Ocean diplomacy, however, has been the outreach to Arab Gulf states, where the Indian Navy has embarked on programme of sustained capacity building and security collaboration. Earlier this month, four Indian Naval ships - Trishul, Tabar, Deepak and Delhi - departed on a month-long deployment to the Arabian Gulf. After a three-day stopover at Dubai (UAE) the ships branched out into two groups. INS Delhi and INS Trishul proceeded to Al-Jubail (Saudi Arabia) and Doha (Qatar) where they engaged in coordinated drills with host navies. Meanwhile, INS Tabar and INS Deepak reached Doha after a brief visit to Kuwait, whereupon the combined contingent of four ships proceeded to Muscat for a final stop-over before returning to Mumbai.
Stronger maritime ties (sub head)
It is a little known fact that the Indian Navy's Western outreach predates its diplomatic turn to the East. Since 2008, the Indian Navy has been partnering regional maritime forces in anti-piracy duties, providing critical support and training to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) navies. Through defence cooperation memorandums and joint committees on defence cooperation, it has substantially enhanced its operational synergy with Arab Gulf navies - many of them members of the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS), an initiative pioneered by the Indian Navy.
The naval engagement with Oman has been most notable. While India and Oman entered into a "strategic partnership" in 2008, naval cooperation has been on since 1993 in the form of a biennial exercise, Naseem Al-Bahr. India has provided naval training and hydrographic support to Oman, while Omani ships have been regular visitors at Indian ports. More significantly, Oman has played a key role in sustaining India's security efforts in the Gulf of Aden by offering berthing and replenishment facilities to Indian naval ships, and hosting a crucial Indian listening post in the Western Indian Ocean. With a new super-port project at Duqm nearing completion, Oman is poised to transform the maritime geopolitics of the Arabian Sea. An appreciation of its strategic potential has led New Delhi to cultivate stronger maritime ties with Muscat.
Importantly for India, the ongoing engagement with Arab navies hasn't been to the exclusion of a maritime relationship with Iran. A week prior to the ongoing tour of GCC countries, two Indian naval ships, Betwa and Beas, visited Bandar-e-Abbas. The Iranian Navy, which has long suffered from a "siege" mindset in the Arabian Gulf, is in the throes of a radical psychological transformation. Having acquired critical war-fighting capabilities, it has been gaining the confidence of a regional maritime power. Emboldened by their county's recent nuclear deal with the West, the Iranian naval leadership has also been on the look-out for new partners to support its naval agenda of establishing control over the Western approaches to the Arabian Gulf. India offers the most potential for such a partnership.
For maritime watchers, India's Arabian Gulf maritime strategy seems driven by two essential considerations. The waterways of the Northern Indian Ocean are among the most important in the world, facilitating the export of large volumes of goods, oil and natural gas. India is a principal beneficiary of the trade and energy flows through the West Asian littorals. The Middle East is also home to nearly seven million Indians, whose remittances contribute significantly to India's economy. The sheer weight of market interaction and commercial exchanges with the Arab Gulf region amplifies its political significant, creating an urgent need for a greater Indian naval presence in the region.
Influence in the IOR
The more determinative factor is the preservation of India's strategic stakes in the Indian Ocean. With China continuing to make military inroads, the past few years have witnessed a shrinking of Indian geopolitical influence in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). Reports of a new Chinese naval base in Djibouti, growing submarine visits, and a spurt in Beijing's maritime military activities in the Western Indian Ocean have created concern among India's security establishment. The nature of the recent submarine forays by the People's Liberation Army Navy suggests an aspiration for a standing security presence in the IOR. For the Indian Navy, therefore, interaction with Gulf navies is a strategic measure aimed at retaining Indian influence in the IOR.
India's "Look West" diplomacy, however, is not all about Indian interests. The tour by Indian naval ships to the region came only a few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Abu Dhabi, the first by an Indian premier in 30 years. As India and the UAE announced a strategic partnership, many of the themes reflected upon in their joint statement were an expression of India's solidarity with the UAE (and more broadly Arab Gulf states). Prominent among these were human security, counter-terrorism, and regional defence. But the GCC's central concern still remains the security of energy shipments through regional chokepoints. With political tensions heightening the vulnerability of the Gulf's vital waterways, the joint statement affirmed India's commitment to strengthening maritime security in the Northern Indian Ocean.
The Indian Navy's burgeoning ties with Arab Gulf navies demonstrate the utility of maritime power as a foreign policy tool. New Delhi's Indian Ocean diplomacy has shown that the political role of sea power remains as important as its wartime uses. While "hard-power" projection remains effective, the modern exercise of "soft power" through "hardware" has no credible substitute. Through its Arabian Gulf initiatives, the Indian Navy has positioned itself as a reliable and supportive partner, forged lasting relationships, and helped shape the Indian Ocean's strategic environment.
More importantly, the Indian Navy has successfully created a durable template of maritime relations in the Western Indian Ocean. Its reassuring presence has validated India's capacity to protect Indian and regional interests, and provided evidence of a productive and dynamic maritime vision. In many ways, India's "Look-West" maritime diplomacy has been critical in rebalancing the Indian Ocean's emerging strategic narrative from "political contestation" to "collaborative development."

Jaden takes his first step towards MotoGP career
Joins Red Bull Rookies Cup
The amazing achievements by the two young brothers, Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena at the Asia Cup of Road Racing in Japan not only put Sri Lanka on the map of racing but also opened the doors for a Sri Lankan to work their way up to a MotoGP. Although Jaden managed to get an opportunity, twelve year old Aaron would have to wait another year before having a go at the Rookies cup as he does not meet the minimum age.
The 2016 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup season will be the tenth season of the Red Bulls MotoGP Rookies Cup. After the selection event which is now in progress at Circuito Guadix in Spain the pre-season testing will be held in April 2016 in Aragon. Teenagers from around the world know that the best way of getting a start in Grand Prix motorcycle racing is by entering the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup. Since its inception in 2007 it has grown into one of the most thrilling 2 wheel spectacles in the world.
JadenGunawardena
The Rookies Cup has released new stars into the world of Grand Prix racing, GP winners and a new generation who will compete through the Moto3, Moto2 and MotoGP classes. Every year the level of competition has climbed and this year's intake are set to raise the bar yet again for the 10th running of the Cup.
If the selection goes as planned Jaden would be starting his International racing career at the Spanish Grand Prix at Jerez in April 2016. The series takes a broad sweep around the classic Grand Prix circuits of Europe including the usual run through the Netherlands, Germany, the Czech Republic, Great Britain and San Marino before ending the year back in Spain again with the Grand Prix of Aragon on September 24 and 25, 2016.

Modern humans out of Africa sooner than thought
FRANCE: Human teeth discovered in southern China provide evidence that our species left the African continent up to 70,000 years earlier than prevailing theories suggest, a study published on Wednesday said.
Homo sapiens reached present-day China 80,000-120,000 years ago, according to the study, which could redraw the migration map for modern humans.
"The model that is generally accepted is that modern humans left Africa only 50,000 years ago," said Maria Martinon-Torres, a researcher at University College London and a co-author of the study.
"In this case, we are saying the H. sapiens is out of Africa much earlier," she told the peer-reviewed journal Nature, which published the study.
While the route they travelled remains unknown, previous research suggests the most likely path out of East Africa to east Asia was across the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East.
The findings also mean that the first truly modern humans -- thought to have emerged in east Africa some 200,000 years ago -- landed in China well before they went to Europe.
There is no evidence to suggest that H. sapiens entered the European continent earlier than 45,000 years ago, at least 40,000 years after they showed up in present-day China.
The 47 teeth exhumed from a knee-deep layer of grey, sandy clay inside the Fuyan Cave near the town of Daoxian closely resemble the dental gear of "contemporary humans," according to the study.
They could only have come from a population that migrated from Africa, rather than one that evolved from an another species of early man such as the extinct Homo erectus, the authors said.
The scientists also unearthed the remains of some 38 mammals, including specimens of five extinct species, one of them a giant panda larger than those in existence today. No tools were found.
"Judging by the cave environment, it may not have been a living place for humans," lead author Wu Liu from the Chinese Academy of Science in Beijing told AFP.
The study, published in the journal Nature, also rewrites the timeline of early man in China.
Up to now, the earliest proof of H. sapiens east of the Arabian Peninsula came from the Tianyuan Cave near Beijing, and dated from no more than 40,000 years ago.

MR's objections overruled
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into mass scale frauds and corruption yesterday rejected the preliminary objections raised by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa's counsel and decided to go ahead with its mandate.
Defence Counsel Gamini Marapone appearing for the former President before the Commission raised objections that serving judges of the High Court cannot be appointed to function as members of the Commission.
Former President Rajapaksa yesterday arrived at the commission for the second day, as its sittings were suspended for yesterday pending a ruling on objections raised by the former President's counsel Gamini Marapone.
Defence Counsel Gamini Marapone while expressing agreement to give evidence said that he will never discard their objections. Counsel Marapone appearing for former President Rajapaksa will take immediate legal action against the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into mass scale fraud and corruption.
The former President was summoned before the Commission to obtain a statement from him over five allegations including the financial loses caused to Independent Television Network for telecasting advertisements in support of him at the last Presidential election.
The Commission also questioned former United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Minister Susil Premajayanth on the unpaid bills to ITN at the last Presidential election.
Minister Susil Pramayantha when cross examined by commissioners said that former President Rajapaksa is not responsible for these charges as he was a mere a candidate fielded by the SLFP for the 2015 Presidential election.
The minister insisted that the SLFP had not given any advertisement to the ITN and all of them were given by two advertising firms.
"We have not even signed agreements with any advertising firm and the issues with regard to non payment of bills to ITN should be taken up with the advertising firm concerned," he said.
He said that the advertising firm in question should take the whole responsibility with regard to losses incurred to the ITN.
Sittings of the Commission was fixed for October 19.

New Zealand go for power against France
Ma'a Nonu won a battle with Sonny Bill Williams for a midfield start in New Zealand's quarter final against France as coach Steve Hansen called out his big guns for Saturday's crunch match.
France coach Philippe Saint-Andre caused his own upset by dropping midfield powerhouse Mathieu Bastareaud for the game at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.
The match has reignited historical rivalries as France beat New Zealand in the 2007 quarter final at the same stadium.
New Zealand in turn beat France just 8-7 in the final four years ago.
"The big boys have to step up to the plate and the team that does this the best will move through to the next round. It's as simple as that," All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said when naming his side on Thursday.
Captain Richie McCaw returns, having recovered from the leg injury that kept him out of the All Blacks final pool game against Tonga.
He is one of four world players of the year, along with Kieran Read, Dan Carter and Brodie Retallick in a side which boasts an impressive 1,295 Test caps in total.

Obama troop plan just enough to prop up Afghan army
US: The decision to keep thousands of US troops in Afghanistan drives home the hard truth that despite billions of dollars and years of training, Afghan security forces are far from ready to go it alone.
But experts are divided on whether the troop levels outlined on Thursday by President Barack Obama are sufficient to prop up the weakling Afghan army.
Obama said 9,800 US troops would stay in Afghanistan until the end of next year, scrubbing plans to pull all but 1,000 from the country after 14 years of US involvement.
James Dobbins, a former US special envoy to Afghanistan and a veteran diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Rand Corporation, said the plan was sufficient to maintain the status quo.
"Retaining the force at the current level will prevent the kind of collapse of order and disintegration of the country into a Syrian-type civil war," he said.
"It's adequate to do that. We have to anticipate the conflict's going to continue at more or less the current level for a while."
The US-led coalition officially ended its combat mission last year and the remaining troops are there to train and advise Afghan counterparts to police their own nation and to carry out counterterrorism operations.
Anthony Cordesman, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said 9,800 troops was a low number given the task involved.
By early 2017 when Obama steps down, their numbers are expected to drop to about 5,500.
"Can you cut well below 10,000 The answer is no you can't, not without crippling any real effort to do much more than hope to hold on to most of the major cities and urban population centres, and then gradually lose the countryside," Cordesman said.
"If you go down to 5,500 you are going to be way under a minimum level, and you have no real slack for forward combat advisers," he added.
The United States has spent more than $60 billion to train Afghan government troops and build their capacity since 2001. But their first year leading security efforts has been brutally hard.
Thousands have died, the Taliban has dealt them a string of blows and desertion rates are high. Plus the Islamic State group has emerged as a new threat in Afghanistan.
The Taliban launched a successful offensive in Helmand province this summer and went on to briefly capture the city of Kunduz. In both instances, Afghan security forces needed support from US-led trainers and aircraft to tilt the balance back in their favour.
"They cannot handle the fight alone in this stage of their development," General John Campbell, who heads the US-led NATO mission in Afghanistan, told US lawmakers last week.

Over 13,000 dual citizenship applications received
The Department of Immigration and Emigration (DIE) has already received about 13,300 dual citizenship applications since it was reintroduced by the present government, DIE Citizenship Division Deputy Controller Chamika Gamage told the Daily News.
With the Amendment of Act No. 45 of 1987, the granting of Dual Citizenship provisions which had been suspended by the previous regime since September 2011 was reintroduced. The provision of dual citizenship was restored on March 28, 2015.
"Normally, we provide dual citizenship for the applicants of nine countries,namely, the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, UK, France, Sweden, Switzerland and Italy. But, rarely do we receive applications from citizens of other European countries and if only those countries certified that they will not cancel their citizenship and have no objection, we would be prepared to grant dual citizenship for them as well. But, not for the citizens of SAARC or Middle East countries," he said. He also said of the 13,300 applications for dual citizenship, only 5,000 applications have been taken in to the consideration and dual citizenship granted to around 700-800 applicants.
A person whose citizenship of Sri Lanka has ceased under Sections 19, 20 and 21 of Citizenship Act No. 18 of 1948 or a person whose citizenship in Sri Lanka is likely to cease, can apply for dual citizenship.
The status will be issued under two categories as resumption and retention. The Section 19 (2) of the Act makes provisions in respect of a person whose citizenship of Sri Lanka has ceased due to obtaining of citizenship in another country and who there after desires to resume the status of a citizen of Sri Lanla and Section 19 (3) of the Act makes provisions in respect of a person who is having a desire to obtain citizenship in another country, while intends to retain the citizenship of Sri Lanka.

Pistorius to be freed from jail
Oscar Pistorius will be released on parole next week after serving one year of a five-year term for killing his girlfriend, officials said Thursday, with the Paralympian star likely to be put under strict house arrest.
Lawyers for Pistorius had argued he should have been allowed out in August after serving a sixth of his sentence for killing model and law graduate Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013.
Steenkamp's parents say Pistorius killed their daughter on purpose and have contested any parole.
"They are not surprised at all -- it was expected," Tania Koen, a lawyer acting on behalf of Steenkamp family, told AFP after speaking to June and Barry Steenkamp on Thursday.
"But it doesn't change anything in their lives. Their daughter is still not coming back.
"Whether Pistorius is incarcerated or released on parole, their daughter is still gone."
After meeting last week, the parole board said it wanted to consult with Steenkamp's family over Pistorius's possible release.
An official statement from the department of correctional services said the parole board "approved the placement of offender Oscar Pistorius under correctional supervision" from Tuesday. - AFP

Rangana rips through Windies batting line up
Rangana Herath with his twenty third five wicket haul ( 6 for 68) and the eighth at Galle proved the West Indies bogey man as he has done on previous occasions against other teams made the visitors plunge headlong towards disaster at the end of the third day's play in the first Test at Galle yesterday.
The Windies in reply to the Sri Lankan first innings score of 484 , were all out for 251 and were made to follow on trailing by 233 runs. At stumps they were 67 for 2 with Herath and debutant Milinda Siriwardena taking the wickets of openers Kraigg Breathwaite and Shai Hope respectively. The West Indies still need 166 runs to escape from an innings defeat. Darren Bravo the top scorer in the first innings with 50 is unbeaten on 20 and with him is left hander Devendran Bishoo.
Sri Lankas hero Rangana Herath who took 6 for 68 in action at Galle yesterday.
West Indies in their first innings with 285 runs adrift to make Sri Lanka bat for the second time started off tentatively with Herath who took two wickets on the previous day starting with a maiden to Marlon Samuels. Nuwan Pradeep bowling from the Rampart end also bowled a maiden over. Darren Bravo looked edgy facing Pradeep and got one past through the slip cordon for 4. But in Herath's second over Marlon Samuels whom the Windies depended on stepped out and drove Herath straight for 4, but two deliveries later Samuels going for a pull shot off a short delivery which kept low played on off his pads which was sufficient enough to dislodge the bail.
Jermaine Blakwood the talented right hander playing in his tenth Test match joined Darren Bravo and brought some order to the West Indian batting. Tharindu Kaushal who replaced Herath was treated harshly by left-hander Bravo , Tharindu Kaushal after being barred of bowling the 'doosra' doesn't look the same bowler which he was , his tendency to bowl quicker at times has made him lose control and Bravo despatched him to the midwicket boundary for a four and a six consecutively to take the Windies past the century mark. The rattled off spinner now had to be aware of his front foot in addition to his arm as he over stepped thrice in the over.
Blackwood and Bravo added 41 runs for the fourth wicket, Dammika Prasad struck when Blackwood edged one into the slips to give Milinda Siriwardena his first Test catch.
Mathews kept his pace-spin going with Prasad and Pradeep from one end Herath and Kaushal from the other end. Kashal was replaced by Milind Siriwardena giving the left armer his first bowl in a Test match. Siriwardene after bowling four overs without much success for ten runs was replaced by Herath once again and Herath obliged his skipper in the second ball just ten minutes before lunch, Darren Bravo going for a big drive on the off ended up with a thick inside edge and Dinesh Chandimal took a spectacular catch at mid-wicket. Bravo had faced 107 deliveries and had eight fours and a six in his 50.
Jason Holder no rabbit with the bat with a Test hundred and a couple of fifties the skipper and his former captain Ramdin had to perform something extra ordinary to restore the innings. Holder after striking four boundaries in his 19 adding 33 runs with Ramdin was caught by Perera, Jerome Taylor added a further 46 with Kemmar Roache for the eighth wicket when Taylor snicked one to Mathews in the slips off Tharindu Kaushal. When Taylor was dismissed the Windies still needed 68 runs to avert the follow-on. Mathews opted for the second new ball at 245 for 8 with Roache and Devendra Bishoo trying desperately to avert the follow. But Herath sharing the new ball with Prasad took the two wickets. Roach who faced eighty deliveries for his 22 fighting doggedly was stumped by Kusal Janith and Shanon Gabriel both fell to Herath who completed another five wicket haul 6 for 68.

A 17-year-old school girl whose birthday fell on October 15 died the same day after falling into an unprotected drain at Nittawela Junction on the Kandy-Katugastota road and was swept away to the Mahaweli Ganga.
She was identified as Sahebdeen Mohamed Asra of Madawela Road, Katugastota, a GCE Advanced Level student of Kandy Badi-ud-Din Mohamed Vidyalaya.
The tragedy occurred while she was returning home with two other girls after attending a tuition class in the pouring rain. She had fallen into the drain in trying to avoid water splashed by a speeding vehicle.
Attempts made by policemen on duty at the spot and pedestrians to pull her out had proved futile.
Although a group of people engaged in sand mining along the river had seen her being swept away and pulled her out from the river by using some ropes but she was found dead by that time.
Her janaza was held at the Katugastota Muslim Burial grounds yesterday morning. Katugastota Police is investigating into the incident.
Meanwhile, Kandy's Municipal Commissioner Chandana Tennakoon said he had notified the Urban Development Authority about the unprotected storm water drainage system in the city and requested it to take immediate steps to cover it with cement bricks.

Siddle to play in PM's XI game against New Zealand
Test paceman Peter Siddle will gain valuable match practice ahead of next month's series against New Zealand from his selection in the Prime Minister's XI, Cricket Australia said Friday.
Siddle, who has been snubbed by Victoria for their domestic one-day campaign so far, will be given the opportunity to play against New Zealand in two games in Canberra next week.
Siddle, 30, who has played 57 Tests for Australia, has been named along with former Test batsmen Mike Hussey in the PM's squad.
The full squads for the PM's XI and CA XI matches at Manuka will be announced early next week.
"We believe it is important to field a strong squad against what we know will be a very competitive New Zealand side in these tour matches," chief selector Rod Marsh said Friday.
"Peter performed well at The Oval in the final Ashes Test (against England) and as part of his preparation for the summer we want to give him some high-standard match practice.
"These tour matches and the first round of the Sheffield Shield give Peter important opportunities to impress ahead of the Test series."
Siddle said he looked forward to playing in both matches next week.
"It's truly an honour to be selected in the Prime Minister's side," he said.
"I haven't played in that match before and I'm really looking forward to it and the following two-day tour match.
"This will give me a good opportunity to experience the pink ball as well as face-off against New Zealand.

Tales of (Non) Magnificent Seven
The Seven Samurai have entered the politics of Lanka. It is more likely that Opposition MPs Dinesh, Wimal, Udaya, Vasudeva, Dew, Tissa, and Gamini play the role of non-Magnificent Seven in the coming period. Of course they have made a heroic demand and urged the government to hold a referendum, to implement the UNHRC recommendations. They insist that the recommendations include a Hybrid Court to investigate war crimes allegations in Lanka. Apparently this strange Hybrid is hidden in the resolution without actually using the word hybrid. These people talk like pavement hawkers of Panchikawatta who insist what they are selling is the original; they will insist so, even before the company head that produces the item!
Vasudeva Nanayakkara
Wimal Weerawansa
Dinesh Gunawardena
Udaya Gammanpila
Gamini Lokuge
DEW Gunasekera
Prof. Tissa Vitarana
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MP Wimal Weerawansa has said if the UNHRC approves the resolution, Sri Lankans should have the liberty to decide if they want any foreign involvement in solving internal issues. Of course Lankans have a choice and that could be a majority decision in Parliament. If the people feel they are fine with the UNHRC recommendations and if necessary a court with foreign judges and investigators can be included to probe alleged war crimes in Sri Lanka, then the government can go ahead with the proposals. However there is a warning that the "Magnificent Seven" may request the people to urge their MPs to vote against the Act to be tabled in parliament asking for the approval for the UN recommendations. They hope to win. If such sabotage is possible, then the state may go into crisis. We must thank them for revealing their sabotage strategy in time, for the progressive masses to take precautions!
US backed resolution on Lanka
Meanwhile, MP Udaya Gammanpila has said they were considering seeking legal advice on challenging the UN report in the Supreme Court. That is fantastic, because HR Commissioner has overlooked the fact that a democratic revolution had taken place in Lanka in the last period. Good to teach a lesson. MP Dinesh Gunawardena has urged the government to pull back from co-sponsoring the US backed resolution on Lanka and said if not the sovereignty and integrity of the country would be severely damaged. "Co-sponsoring a resolution is similar to writing one's own death certificate and is a bad precedent to other countries. This move has also put our allies in a difficult situation," he has said.
We have a funny combination in this cow boy group. Two ex Sama Samajists, one ex-Communist, other four are chauvinist of various kinds. So, the ideological pot of this group of cow boys is filled with a concoction that could be typical fascistic poison. Vasudeva Nanayakkara says the government decision to back the US-led resolution was a betrayal similar to the 1815 agreement signed with the British. "We all know the nature of the US. They just want to get closer to their prey," he has said. Yes, there is a similarity between 1815 and 2015. In 1815, people suffered under a violent Wadiga Raja and Kandyan people signed an agreement to get rid of royal violence. To day the Lankan people want to get rid of barbarism created by Mahinda raja. Hence Lankans signed an agreement with the UN. However there is a difference. Then the Kandyan lords trusted the vicious agents of British imperialism. Today, the UN represents the world community including the trusted friends of the cow boy group, China, Russia etc.
Finding war criminals
Still, UPFA Member of Parliament Dinesh Gunawardena slammed the proposed accountability of UN stating it will be a "witch-hunt against war heroes." We all know how the "war heroes" were treated by the Mahinda regime. General Fonseka could explain in great detail that treachery of the worst kind. However we are interested in finding the war criminals who acted with a fascistic vision of genocide and inhuman mentality. Mr. Gunawardena has said that the UN resolution on Lanka was a "clear violation of our constitution." Which Constitution may I ask Dinesh still believes that the Mahinda Constitution is proper and valid. "Those who have been agitating for a separate state and supporting terrorism, are again at work," he warned. If people follow the direction given by this Magnificent Seven, then of course we may have to face a Tiger movement equipped with mini nuclear weapons in the future. Fortunately for Lanka, this Magnificent Seven is a non-starter.
