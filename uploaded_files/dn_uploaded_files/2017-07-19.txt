Dickwella, Gunaratne fashion out a famous win
Fifth successful run chase in history and highest in Asia :
Niroshan Dickwella and Asela Gunaratne fashioned out a well deserving four-wicket win for Sri Lanka in the one-off Test against Zimbabwe as they chased down 388 in the fourth innings of Test on the fifth and final day at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka who resumed the final day at 170-3 and needing a further 218 to win finished on 391-6 with Gunaratne playing the role of sheet anchor despite being handicapped by a left hamstring injury (that prevented him from bowling in the Zimbabwe second innings) to remain not out on 80 scored off 151 balls with six fours.
Gunaratne figured in two crucial stands that took the game away from Zimbabwe after the visitors had reduced Sri Lanka to 203-5 within the first hours play by sending back the two overnight batsmen Kusal Mendis for 66 and former skipper Angelo Mathews for 25  both falling to the leg-spin of Graeme Cremer.
At that stage Zimbabwe would have fancied their chances of running through the rest of the Lankan batting with Cremer getting the odd ball to spite and turn viciously whenever it hit the bowlers rough.
However Gunaratne joined Niroshan Dickwella in a partnership of match winning proportions adding 121 runs for the sixth wicket and after Dickwellas departure for a well constructed 81 off 118 balls (6 fours), Dilruwan Perera (29 not out) made certain that Sri Lanka did not lose any more wickets by figuring in an unbroken stand of 67 with Gunaratne to seal the match in Sri Lankas favour.
It was the fifth highest successful run chase in Test history and the highest in Asia. In Sri Lanka it was the highest successful run chase after 377 by Pakistan at Pallekele in 2015 and 352 by Sri Lanka against South Africa at the P Sara Oval in 2006.
It was not an easy chase by any standards although Sri Lanka was playing the lowest ranked Test team in the world. Zimbabwe had till the final day kept their options open of pulling off a maiden Test win against Sri Lanka having shown great resolve and fight to take the game right into the final day - something that Zimbabwe sides had not done in the recent past.
Zimbabwe could consider themselves somewhat unlucky when a stumping chance against Dickwella when he was on 37 went against them. There will always be a debate on that decision. Chakabva, the wicket-keeper whipped the bails off when Dickwella missed a ball from Sikandar Raza.
The field umpires went upstairs and referred it to the third umpire Chettihody Shamshuddin of India who ruled it as not out after going through several replays. Dickwellas foot to all appearances looked to be planted on the line and not behind it, in which instance he should have been given out.
To add to that disappointment Chikabva also spilt edges from Dickwella at 63 and from Perera at 13 both off the unfortunate Sean Williams who along with his captain Cremer send down a marathon 154.2 of the 217.2 overs bowled by Zimbabwe bowlers in the match.
One had to question the over reliance on the spinners by Cremer when he had two other specialist fast bowlers in the line-up. Donald Tiripano was never given a bowl in the second innings and Chris Mpofu sent down just six overs. Zimbabwe clearly showed their inexperience at this level not having the opportunity to play consistently and some of Cremers field placing was questionable.
Credit should be given to the curator of the R Premadasa Stadium Asanga Herath and his team for preparing a splendid pitch that produced some remarkable and challenging cricket throughout the five days. The pitch here is renowned for being a batsmans paradise but on this occasion although each of the four innings produced totals of 300 plus it also gave a fair chance to the spinners with Rangana Herath bagging 11 wickets and Cremer nine. The R Premadasa Stadium is not renowned to host Test matches but in the nine they have it has produced the highest Test score of all time  952-6 as well as the highest successful run chase in Asia  388.
Gunaratne was named Man of the Match and surprisingly a Man of the Series was also presented when only a one-off Test was played. It was given to Rangana Herath.

e-log books for all multi-day fishing vessels
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to provide e-log books for all multi-day fishing vessels to enter fish harvesting information.
Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the Ministry would provide e-log books for 2,328 multi-day fishing vessels at the total cost of Rs. 78 million.
According to international laws, it was compulsory to maintain records of fish catch information by the multi-day fishing vessels engaged in fishing activities in international waters and to provide it to the European Union (EU) to avoid the mismanagement of fisheries resources, said the Minister.
"Having a good recognition among the international community as a country which follows international rules and regulations related to the fisheries industry is very important to avoid future issues related to the industry such as ban on fishing imports that we experienced recently," he said. 
The software used in e-log books has been developed by the University of Colombo and the e-log books would be handed over to the owners of multi-day fishing vessels free of charge and<U+2008>the vessel owners would be trained to use the e-log book, he added.

Eyes Fixed on the goal
Spartan Maleesha Navaratne, Head Prefect of Hillwood College Kandy is surrounded by a belt of responsibilities. Perfect Prefects features Head Girl Maleesha Navaratne who values courage and hard work when it comes to fulfilling her obligations.
When you take the role of Head Prefect, I think the Head Prefect should have a passion for this role. That is one of the main things when it comes to qualities a Head Prefect should possess. Because if you dont want to be a leader, there is no point in being the Head Prefect. And with this position comes great responsibility. I think a Head Prefect needs to be responsible, punctual and should be dedicated and committed. She has to be able to balance her studies as well as school work and extra-curricular activities, said Navaratne
Fire melts butter but hardens steel.
Other than that, a head girl should be able to face challenges. There are different ways of facing challenging situations. Sometimes you have to be sentimental, sometimes you have to be hard on a situation. But whatever it is you have to have the courage to face it. As long as you have courage any challenge can be overcome, explained Navaratne
Navaratne is responsible for her guild. It consists of 40 prefects. Nine seniors and 31 juniors.
I am responsible for each one of their behaviours- how they lead the school and lead students. A head prefect should be responsible for her own character  how she behaves at school and as well as outside school and in other situations, pointed out Navaratne
When every school function comes up, she has to be responsible for almost every aspect.
The Hillwood Week which is due in May is one of the biggest events in our school. For a whole week, we have an event every day from Monday to Sunday. That is the busiest week in our school calendar, and every event I am doing that week is handled by me and my guild of prefects.
Everything is under my responsibility and I have to make sure everything is done well. Hillwood was founded on May 15, 1890. This year is the 127th anniversary. It is a tradition in our school that the week the 15th falls on May is considered as Hillwood week. Every year, each day we have allocated some events which should happen.
On Monday we have Alms Giving and inter-religious day, Tuesday we have the Prefects Induction, Wednesday we have a combined Aesthetic program, Thursday we have Shramadana and on Friday we have the Prize Giving (which is one of the biggest events in the school), Saturday is Founders Day and Sunday is Hillwood Sunday, elucidated Navaratne
Other than that, the school have their days. Each club has their days. e.g Commerce Day, English Day and she has to oversee them as well with the president of each club.
When I look at the world I am concerned about those who are cornered in society. When I say cornered, I mean people who are cornered because they are drug addicts, homosexuals, transgenders. I feel concerned about people who are cornered because of their disabilities and because they were born in different ways. That is what catches my attention, added Navaratne
Character and commitment would have been why she was elected Head Prefect.
I was chosen as Head Prefect for many reasons. When I was going for the interview, I think they chose me basically because of my character and my personality and how I would handle situations. I am a Christian and this is a Christian school. A higher attention is given to Christians. But we also give opportunities for other religions as well. Because in the prefects guild there is always at least one Muslim prefect, with Buddhists and Christians Prefects as well, explained Navaratne
Her ambition was to be a Marine Engineer because she wanted to travel.
But they told me that if I was to become a Marine Engineer I would have to do Science & Math for my A/Ls. They said it might be a bit competitive. The school advised me to do Commerce or Arts and I chose Arts. But I still plan on pursuing my ambition. I also have a plan on joining the UN Embassy in some way. So either way I will get to travel a lot, stated Navaratne
Support from above and from school has taken her a long way.
The first thing that strengthens me is my God. In any situation which I face which is hard, I just look up to God and in some way, I find a solution how to get through it. My Principal has always been a great support to me. My teachers and my guild of prefects have always been a source of strength to me, in whatever situation. If something goes wrong, they have always been there to help me and show me areas that I would not see, to solve any situation or problem, informed Navaratne
There is also a uniqueness to the Prefects attire. They wear the Kandyan Osariya with the blazer. The prefects are privileged to wear that.
I was born in 1999, and I lived in Colombo till 2009. But my mother wanted to bring me up in a society like Kandy. So we had to move to Kandy. My dads original hometown was in Kandy. But my Dad stayed on in Colombo because he works there. He comes every weekend. They have been supportive in every way. They have never let me down in anything. In any situation they have always been there for me, said Navaratne.

Reading books and watching movies are her outside interests.
I read most of Jeffrey Archer and Nora Roberts, which I find very interesting. Recently I read Jeffrey Archers Prisoner of Birth. The way Jeffrey Archer expresses himself makes his books very interesting to read. He has the readers attention by the way he writes something. When it comes to movies lately I watched Collateral Damage and I have watched movies like Suicide Squad and Pirates of the Caribbean and Lucy, said Navaratne
Navaratne consider passion the most important requirement to lead.
If you have a passion to be a leader, then that is all you need. The sky is the limit. All you need is to have your goal and just aim for it. Pursue your passion and goals whatever the obstacles or challenges might be, keep your eye on the goal and reach for it, victory is yours as long as you aim for a goal, summed up Navaratne.

Fitch revises Outlook on Sri Lanka to stable
Fitch Ratings has taken rating actions across the Asia in February, and the Outlooks on Sri Lanka (B+) and Vietnam (BB-) were revised to stable from Negative in February and June, respectively.
While it is difficult to generalize across such a diverse set of economies, a common theme is that real GDP growth has mostly remained strong across Asia frontier sovereigns.
At the top of the pack is Bangladesh, which recorded 7.1% growth in 2016, facilitated by wage increases and accommodative monetary policy that offset headwinds from infrastructure bottlenecks and security concerns.
Vietnam has also been a strong performer, with growth of 6.2% in 2016, led by manufacturing and services, accompanied by continued FDI inflows and a policy focus on macro stability.
At the other end of the growth spectrum, Mongolia slowed sharply in 2016 to 1.1% due to weaker commodity prices and a halt in FDI on the back of a major mining project delay.
Weak public finances weigh on most Asia frontier sovereigns, with the exception of Bangladesh. Mongolias fiscal deficit was near 17% of GDP due to large pre-election spending and lower commodity prices. The deficit, alongside substantial currency depreciation, pushed up government debt to 92% of GDP.
High government debt and a narrow revenue base also weigh on Sri Lankas finances. IMF supported programmes in Sri Lanka and, more recently Mongolia, have lifted market sentiment and stabilised credit profiles.
The programmes should facilitate sound polices and fiscal sustainability.
Structural Challenges Structural factors are also among the key rating constraints for Asia frontier sovereigns. Per capita incomes remain lower than in other regions, with only the Maldives surpassing USD 4,000.
A reliance on a narrow economic base can also render some countries more vulnerable to external shocks and pose a constraint to their rating profiles.
The Maldives relies heavily on the tourism sector, which represents 84% of current external receipts.
Ultimately, rating trajectories for frontier Asia will depend on the ability of policy-makers to sustain their emerging track records of macroeconomic stability and implement structural reforms to enhance medium term growth prospects. In countries with IMF-supported programmes, successful implementation of policies to achieve fiscal consolidation will be key.
Credit developments in frontier markets can change quickly, as evident from growing external pressures in Pakistan.

GSP+ new opportunity for Sri Lanka to expand export basket - Dr Mohammed
The regaining of GSP Plus concession has given a new opportunity for Sri Lanka to expand its export basket, said Senior Trade Felicitation Advisor International Trade Centre, Dr. Mohammed Saeed.
Speaking at the MoU signing ceremony of the National Institute of Exports (NIOE) and International Trade Centre (ITC), a UN agency based in Geneva, he said that Sri Lanka should be able to enjoy this facility at least for the next five years and the country should exploit this situation.
I have observed that though this concession is extended for over 7,000 products, Sri Lanka have not exported some products at all and these untapped areas should be focused on soon. More education to exporters too should be given and we are working with the Export Development Board and some universities in this regard as well,he said.
Saeed said that it was also important that the NIOE also came on board to educate the exports in these areas and other export related issues by singing a MoU with them to launch educational programs in this direction.
Chairman NIOE, Dr. Jagath Peiris said that they conduct professional training courses related to exports currently for the certificate and diploma levels.
He said it is an honour for the NOIE to be recognized by ITC in recognition of the work carried out by the NCE through the NIOE for the benefit of exporters to raise awareness on the benefits of the Trade Facilitation Agreement and to be better acquainted with the export procedural tasks associated with successful trade.
The courses enable those who are employed in various capacities in export enterprises, as well as school leavers who wish to engage in the field of exports to advance their careers.
The MoU is a part of the implementation of an EU-funded project in Sri Lanka aimed at strengthening trade competitiveness of Sri Lankan SMEs in regional,SAARC and ITC, said, National Chamber of Exporters, President, Ramal Jasinghe.
This would also help expand exports, said Secretary General, CEO, NCE, M. Shiham Marikar

Hacking of Presidents official website: Schoolboy discharged from case

The Colombo Chief Magistrate today ordered to discharge two suspects including a 17-year-old schoolboy from the case against them for allegedly securing an unauthorized access into the President's official website.
Filing a report before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the CID informed Court that the Attorney General has given instructions to release the suspects from the case citing that he is not expecting to proceed legal action against two suspects.
Meanwhile, the Court also issued and order directing the CID that several production items which were seized from the suspects' possession be returned to the suspects forthwith.
The schoolboy and other suspect Dulan Amarasinghe, 27, had been released on bail at a previous occasion.
The CID had alleged that the schoolboy residing in Kadugannawa area had intruded into the Presidents official website www.president.gov.lkon August 25, 2006 after altering its original data.
A group calling itself the "Sri Lankan Youth" posted a statement in Sinhalese on the web page. The concerned statement says; We are extremely displeased about the decision to hold GCE A\L in April since the Sinhala/Hindu New Year falls in between the exam dates. Therefore, reconsider that decision. Furthermore, take care of the security of Sri Lankan websites. Or else, we will have to face a cyber war. If you cannot control the situation hold a Presidential Election. Stop the Prime Minister's irresponsible work. Look more into the problems of the university students.

How do you decide your next book
For years now, Ive been trying to understand the method behind my madness when it comes to answering that never-ending question bookworms all over ask themselves: what do I read next
Once upon a time, I, too, had my TBR pile, stretching ever-high towards the sky. Making a dent in that pile, though, was another story entirely. Some days Id pull out that book that had been resting right at the top of the pile, waiting patiently for me to grab it. But other days, Id pull out the story that had been sitting hopelessly close to the bottom, the one Id said Id read ages ago, but had been all but forgotten. And then, sometimes (okaya lot of the time) I ignored my TBR pile altogether, and simply landed on a book by randomly searching, and/or picking it up on a whim at the local bookstore or library.
Believe me, Ive tried sticking to my TBR pile like glue to a thumb. I mean, that list was there for a reason, right I actually did want to pick up the books that were there, after all! But more often than Id like to admit, I found myself gently putting the book back on the shelf.
At first I thought it was content related  that if I read a romance before, then Id want to pick up a romance next. And yes, sometimes that was the case! But not often. In fact, there have been lots of times where I also go the opposite direction instead. For example, if I read a romance before, then my next book might be a chilling dystopia or a hard-boiled thriller. And then, too, sometimes Ill pick up a book thats kind of related, content-wise, to what I read last, but is just different enough to not feel like the same book, or worse, an imitation of a book. Thats the beauty of books, yknow Just like people, they dont always fit into one category.
I know there are people out there who, despite whatever book they read before, will pick up the book at the top of their TBR pile. These readers can tell us days, even weeks in advance what book theyll be reading next, and when. Its kind of amazing, actually  I can only imagine what kind of organizational skills those bookworms have, too!
Theres also an abbreviated version of this decision-making process, which sounded promising. There are readers I know who look at their whole TBR stack, and pick out the four or five theyll read that month. No particular order or more specific timeline necessary, just a shorter method of lining up books so that youre not wandering aimlessly through your local library, trying to find something thatll catch your eye. I tried this method myself, last April. I wondered if maybe I minimized the amount of books in my TBR, but still gave myself room to move around, it would be easier to predict where Id want to go next. Unfortunately, that list, too, was completely ignored.
So these days, when somebody asks to look at my TBR List, Ive started showing them a blank page or an empty screen. Because, honestly, sometimes it feels like a book is more likely to be read when its not in my so-called List. Ive realized Im what you might call a mood reader.
That is, I think Im someone who picks up a book more often than not simply according to what theyre feeling in the moment. It might come out of that TBR list, it might not. I used to feel guilty about this, about leaving my TBR List to collect dust. But now, Im learning to embrace the unpredictability of it  after all, some of my most beloved, life-changing books were found after wandering aimlessly through the shelves of my favorite bookstore or library.
Sure, I still have a virtual place where I put books that snag my interest, authors I like, sequels I plan to get to, and the recommendations of others. I call it my Cloud  a name I chose because its not an orderly list, or a neat stack. Theres no definitive bottom or top to a cloud that we can see, which is precisely what often happens with the books I put in my virtual version. I pick out whatever title, author, or recommendation stands out to me in that moment, and that works for me.
As I reflected on and came to terms with my process (or lack thereof, as it were), though, I began to wonder. Everybody must have their method of finding their next read. Are there other ways of choosing a book I havent thought of How do you, fellow reader, decide what to read next

IMF approves US$ 167.2 mn for SL
On July 17, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed the second review of Sri Lankas economic performance under the program supported by a three-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement.
Completion of the review enables the disbursement of the equivalent of SDR 119.894 million (about US$ 167.2 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of SDR 359.682 million (about US$ 501.5 million).In completing the review, the Executive Board granted a waiver of nonobservance of the continuous performance criterion on accumulation of external arrears which was missed due to continued difficulties of establishing a payment platform and waivers of applicability of the performance criteria for end-June 2017 on floor of the central government primary balance and the program net official international reserves of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, given the unavailability of the information necessary to assess observance.
Sri Lankas three-year extended arrangement was approved on June 3, 2016 in the amount of about SDR 1.1 billion (US$1.45 billion, or 185 percent of quota in the IMF at that time of approval of the arrangement.
The governments reform program, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macroeconomic stability and promote inclusive growth.
Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Acting Chair and Deputy Managing Director, said: Sri Lankas performance under the Fund-supported program has been broadly satisfactory. Macroeconomic and financial conditions have been stable, despite severe weather events and global market volatility.
 The authorities launched fundamental income tax reform, undertook meaningful corrective actions to achieve program targets on international reserves, and remain committed to the reform program. Going forward, the reform momentum should strengthen further with greater ownership, building on the progress made so far.
Fiscal performance has been strong. Targets for the fiscal balance and tax revenue have been met.
The new Inland Revenue Act, which has been submitted to parliament, will support fiscal consolidation, make the tax system more efficient and equitable, and generate resources for social and development programs. Nevertheless, Sri Lankas high debt burden and gross financing needs require further revenue-based consolidation. Timely progress in structural reforms, including tax administration and energy pricing, will strengthen the platform for durable consolidation.
Inflation and credit growth remain on the high side. While monetary policy was tightened in March, further tightening is desirable until clear signs emerge that inflation pressures and credit expansion have subsided.
While financial soundness indicators remain stable, banks capital adequacy ratio has declined due to rapid credit growth. Financial sector supervision should be strengthened, and macro-prudential measures could be deployed to rein in credit growth if needed.
Continued international reserves accumulation and enhanced exchange rate flexibility, to which the authorities are committed, would reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerabilities.

Inefficient SLFP electoral organizers will be replaced by educated youths: Amaraweera
All inefficient and ineffective SLFP electoral organizers will be removed and replaced with a group of educated and intelligent youths with unblemished character. The party is fully geared to make this change, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera.
Addressing an SLFP district seminar held at Embilipitiya, Amaraweera said it was common knowledge that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called a Presidential election two years ahead of schedule. At that election, they supported Mahinda Rajapaksa as he was chairman of the SLFP. Amaraweera said he secured the biggest number of preferential votes for Rajapaksa from his electorate.
Thereafter, victorious President Maithripala Sirisena took over the SLFP mantle and requested him to join his government. They did so in keeping with a decision taken by the party central committee, he said.
He added that at the General Elections which followed, the UNP gained the majority number of 106 to the SLFPs 92. When President Sirisena requested them to join a national government with the UNP, they did so in response to his request, the minister said. His supporters in his electorate too endorsed this move as the UNP had already begun to harass SLFPers as in 1978. Another motive behind their decision to join a national government was to protect SLFP supporters from harassment, Minister Amaraweera said. If they did not join the national government, the UNP would have formed a government with the support of the TNA or some of the members of the Joint Opposition, he said.
Some of those in the joint opposition now lambasting the government had already started hush-hush talks with UNP delegates to join the government by meeting them at night, he added.
He said apart from protecting party supporters, their decision to join the National Government had helped to achieve many victories for the people. At that time there was immense pressure exerted on Sri Lanka by the UNHRC on the human rights front. There was also the threat of sending some people to the electric chair and then the question of appointing a tribunal with foreign judges, the European ban on fish exports from Sri Lanka, threat of international sanctions and loss of GSP plus facility. All this was successfully thwarted as a result of the SLFP decision to join a national government with the UNP, the minister said.
There was unbridled freedom in the country today to even criticize the government. There was freedom to level unfounded and frivolous charges against government politicians by using the social media. But no one spoke of the immense benefits granted to the people by the government, he added.
Despite all such criticism no one would even be able to topple this government till 2020, the minister said.

Internet tax reduction soon
Govt. was criticised for increasing tax on data:
Active online participation of youth encouraged :
social media can be a double edged sword :
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva yesterday implied relaxing of the telecommunication levy on internet services shortly.
The Deputy Minister was addressing an event at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute to mark the launch of www.iVoice.lk, an online platform for youth to discuss social issues and drive innovative solutions.
The Government came under heavy criticism in the recent past over increasing tax on internet data. However, you will hear good news with regard to data tax in the next couple of days from the higher political authorities of the Government. It will be a positive step taken by the Government to encourage active online participation of youth, de Silva said.
The Deputy Minister, pointing out that the social media is a double edged sword, invited the youth to use it responsibly to participate in development and have meaningful engagements.
The social media played a vital role in bringing this Government into power, and in the same way they could send this Government home.
"We must understand this reality. Rather than licencing, closing or blocking them, the Government must rectify its own faults and move forward. Politicians must have a backbone do so, he opined. The Deputy Minister however stressed that the social media should not be used to insult anybody with doctored pictures, mudslinging posts or videos. Such posts reflect your level of discipline, he added. De Silva also highlighted the importance of youth voting at elections, adding that criticism in social media platforms alone would not help to see the changes they want. Sri Lanka Development Journalist Forum Chairperson Prof Padmasiri Wanigasundera and United Nations Population Fund Country Representative Ritsu Nacken addressed the gathering.
Social media activists Nadie Wasalamudaliarachchi, Gopiharan Perinpam and Himal Kothalawala conducted the panel discussion on How can social media help us build a better Sri Lanka attended by over 100 young social media users across the country.

Lammermoor Bride's chamber
Sir Walter Scott was a Scottish writer who published his first romantic novel Waverley in 1814.. In five years he produced nine novels. His novels have been romantic novels with Scottist historic events and Scottish characters. In many novels pretty heroines are involved and the problems of love and marriage are highlighted.
In Scott's The Heart of Midlotian the herione Jeanie is a poor Scottish lower class unmarried girl,. She refuses to tell a lie to save her sister from a charge of infanticide. She goes to London to appear before the king to seek a pardon for her sister.
However Jeanie was not a girl with a sexual drive, her promise has been disrespected. But, despite numerous obstacles a happy marriage takes place. There is no sexual plot in this novel. Scott deviated from his Scottish events and Scottish characters in Ivanhoe (1819).
historic romance
However pretty women (Saxon Rowena) and Rebecca (a Jewess) as well as fighting knights, grim scenes of war, brutal lust and romantic love are expressed in a historic romance in England during the reign of Richard 1. Richard I. Richard I was in the Holy Land in 1194 engaged in the Third Crusade and on his return journey he was kept a captive in Austria. During this period his brother Prince John was ruling over England.
Richard I was in disguise as Black Knight taking part in the most gallantly contested tournaments of the age. Ivanhoe was a brave youth, the son of Cedric, one of Saxon nbility. Ivanhoe too has been with Richard I in the Holy Land and returned to England, working in disguise. Ivanhoe took part in the tournament at Ashby where he became the glorious winner.
He had to remove his helmet when he received the chaplet of honour from the Queen of the Tourney, the Lady Rowena. She recognised him with a faint shriek.
When he knelt down to kiss her hand he collapsed at her feet as he was bleeding because of severe injuries sustained during the combat. He was rushed into the house of a beautiful Jewess, Rebecca who nursed and treated him with great devotion and love. But there was a military ruffian of the Order of Knights Templers called Brain d
eBois-Guilbert who snatched off Rebecca to the castle of Torquilstone where he tried to insult and mollest her. But she vehimently protested his unlawful advances declaring that he was a Christian and she was a Jewess. But the ruffian just laughed over her protests. She prepared to fling herself out of the window into the moat.
However the ruffian could not rape her as he was called back immediately to defend the castle, as a group of outlaws from the greenwood led by Robin Hood and the Black Knight, saved Rebecca. But the powerful ruffian charged Rebecca as a witch and she was to be burnt alive. But in the end there was a dual fight between Ivanhoe and the ruffian.
The Bride of Lammermoor was a masterpiece of romantic fiction by Sir Walter Scott.
The story was set in Scotland. William Dalrymple, first Viscount of Stair, was one of Scotland's ablest lawyers. He was an important figure in the political reconciling of Scotland during the turbulent times. He was well recognized and respected as a noble statesman.
None the less, Lady Stair was heavily influenced by power, status and wealth. She was often referred to as a shrew or a witch.
Their pretty daughter was Jenet Dalrymple whe was in love with Lord Rutheford and was engaged to him.
However as rutherford was not rich and powerful the Stairs pressured Jenet to break up the engagement. The Stairs identified and selected David Lumbar, Lord of Baldoon as her ideal partner. She was forced to marry Baldoon against her wish and choice.
Wedding night screams
The marriage took place on August 12,1668 and the bridal party stayed in Stair's place for a few says before proceeding to Baldoon's residence.
During the wedding night screams were heard from the bridal chamber of the household. Jenet was found to be insane and Dumbar was lying in a pool of blood in his bed.
It was believed that Jenet stabbed Dunbar. But he did not die. Jenet never recovered from her insanity and she died shortly after this unfortunate incident.
Pathetic love
It was said that Dunbar declined to reveal the events that resulted in his injury.
Sir Walter Scott's romantic novel The Bride of Lammamoor was based on the above historical mishap in Scotland. Scott changed the names and created events but retained the essential substance and the theme in his creation. The novel was an immediate success substance and the theme in his creation. The novel was an immediate success and became very popular. Critics rated it with Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as a story of pathetic love. Scott created Lucy Ashton out of Jenet Dalrymple.
Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor, is said that its effect and popularity were surprising in Western Europe. The first dramatisation of it took place in London in 1819, less than two weeks after the publication of the novel. In 1827 a one act opera based on this novel was performed in Paris. In 1828, a drama was also performed in Paris. In 1829 Michele Carafa's opera'Le Nozze di Lammermoor was performed in Paris.
Marriage promise
The most famous Italian libereto Lucia di Lammermoor by Gaetano Donizetti and Cammarano had it premiere in Naples in September 1835. In the Italian libreto there were shifts and changes in the plot and the characters. It was an opera in three acts with music by Gaetano Donizstti and libretoo by Salvatore Cammarano. The key characters were Lucia Ashton, sister of Lord Enrico, Edgardo, Lucia's lover, Lord Enrico Ashton, holder of Ravenswood castle and beother of Lucia, Lord Artufo Bucklaw-the enforced husband of Lucia and Alisa, the servant companion of Lucia. Two new characters have been introduced. They were Normanno, the chief huntsman and captain of the guard at Rawenwoods castle and Raimondo, the chaplain to the Ashtons. The two scenes in act one idicate a fruitless search for Lucia's lover and a secret meeting between Lucia and her lover (Edgardo).
They exchange rings and Edgardo leaves for France. In act two Normano and Enrico intercept and forge letters sent to Lucia by Edgardo. Lucia is misled saying that Edgardo has broken his marriage promise.
They have found her Lord Arturo Bucklow to be her husband, despite her protests and misgivings. Scene two in act two is the wedding ceremony when Edgardo burst in to blame, Lucia for breaking the marriage contract. He throws the exchanged ring and crushes it under his shoes. Edgardo was forcibly expelled from the ceremony. In act three often the first scene the encounter between Enrico and Engardo in a stormy night at the Tower is not performed. Scene two is Lucia's wedding night.
Raimando announces with horror to the wedding guets what he had seen  a scene of murder in the bridal chamber. Lucia appears before them quite pale and insane. Enrico rushes in and moves towards her. But Lucia faints into the arms of Alisa. In scene three in the burial ground of the Ravenswood Edgardo broods among the tombs. He realises that Lucia is dead. He stabs homself.
One of the most intriguing questions about Lucia di Lammermoore is: How did it really happen Did half crazed Lucia murder her bride groomBucklaw on their wedding night The assumption was that either that she has stabbed Dunbar (Aeturo) or that Rutherford (Edgardo) had somehow entered the bridal chamber and done the deed.

Lankan cleared of charges in 19-year-old rape case
A Sri Lankan national charged with raping a young South Korean woman nearly two decades ago was acquitted by the top court on Tuesday, in the final twist of a long-drawn-out investigation into the cold case.
The Supreme Court upheld the not-guilty rulings by the lower courts on the 51-year-old foreigner, whose identity has been withheld, citing a lack of evidence.
"It is difficult to believe the veracity of their testimonies in light of objectivity and details of the statements," the top court said in the ruling. The defendant was indicted in 2013 on charges of robbing and raping an 18-year-old college student, only identified by her last name Chung, in 1998. The belated indictment came as the DNA of the defendant, who was arrested for soliciting prostitution to a minor, was found to match that left on Chung's underwear.
Chung was found dead on Oct. 17, 1998, after being hit by a 25-ton dump truck on a highway in Daegu, some 302 kilometres south-east of Seoul. The police had suspected rape as they found her lingerie 30 meters away from the site of the accident, but concluded it was an accidental death.
In the fresh investigation, the prosecutors found that Chung jumped into the road as she ran away from her attackers in fear and had lost sense of direction in the dark.
The prosecutors indicted the Sri Lankan and two other accomplices of the same nationality on counts of special robbery and rape in 2013.

Magistrate gives evidence in Court of Appeal
Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera:
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake gave evidence regarding a contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25 last year, yesterday.
When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, the first witness former Homagama Magistrate Ranaga Dissanayake informed that on January 25, 2016,
Ven. Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
He began to address Court without obtaining any permission in a manner of obstructing court proceedings. He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept White Mans Law (suddage neethiya) and requested to release remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner of obstructing Court proceedings, but he continued to do so, the Magistrate said.
Gnanasara Thera began to intimidate Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, he said.
Meanwhile, Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate identified Gnasara Thera in the open court as the person who involved in the alleged offence at the Homagama Magistrates Court yesterday.
The evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnasara Thera. The Court of Appeal proceeding has listed eight persons, including Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses. Further inquiry into the matter fixed for today.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution. At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
On January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.

MHD launches first high rise apartment project The Heights at Edmonton
Millennium Housing Developers (MHD) diversified into high rise projects last year, launching its first high rise apartment project The Heights at Edmonton at Edmonton Road, Kirulapone, followed by The Heights at Nawala Road, Colombo 05.
Its latest at Rajagiriya Road, Rajagiriya reflect the same concept of providing high standards of luxury and style to corporate sector executives and entrepreneurs as residences or as investments.
Attractively priced to offer affordable luxury, Green Heights at Rajagiriya is particularly noteworthy for its design, which matches the needs of corporate sector managers and entrepreneurs for a higher standard of style and elegance, practical convenience, recreational and sports facilities and low maintenance costs.
Millennium Housing Developers has shown steady growth through this initiative. Chairman's Review of 2013/14 predicted such a scenario. Despite this industrial set back experienced in 2013, the potential demand for affordable middle income housing continue to surge due to rapid urbanization, high price on renting or lease housing and decline in housing loan interest rates. Looking ahead, the government is focused on achieving a per capita of US$4,000 by 2016; highly encouraging for housing sector it said
We learned a lot about the needs of our target consumer before we launched our first city high rise project The Heights at Edmonton Road Colombo 05. We gained more knowledge with The Heights @ Nawala Road.
We can now say this project is more keenly attuned to our customers genuine needs than ever before said Mr. Harshith Dharmadasa Chairman of MHD.
A luxury apartment in the outskirts can give you better value in terms of living style and standards, simply because the developers outlay for land is lower here than in Colombo; customers get the convenience of Colombo, with a much shorter commute plus higher standard of luxury at a lower price, he said.

Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital takeover:
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) alleged that the Health Minister has misled the President on the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital takeover.
GMOA Secretary Dr.Haritha Aluthge said the Health Minister staged a drama misleading the President.He said Senaratne has pretended that the Dr. Neville Fernando Hospital was taken over by the Government and the SAITM issue is solved now.
The GMOA will inform both the President and the Prime Minister about the issue in writing, he said.
It is questionable of the net profit earned by Dr. Fernando in the past and whether he had given required service to the students for the money they paid for. Now he has received a chance to get patients to his hospital and make more profits. The Ministers have arranged it for him, he said in the statement.
The Health Ministers utterances have raised several questions. Has the Government taken over the hospital or was it just leasing the hospital What is the connection between the Bank of Ceylon and the hospital What is the legal right of Dr. Fernando, what is the proposed administration and the role of Dr. Fernando in it and whether patients get free services are some of the questions raised by us, Aluthge said said in the statement.

National Govt., come to stay
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has expounded on the merits of a national government, adding that both the UNP and SLFP stands to benefit under a market economy with social justice. Addressing a foundation laying ceremony in Pannipitiya, Premier Wickremesinghe stressed that the benefits of the market economy cannot be restricted to a few industrialists and business persons only. These benefits should filter down to the employees too since the market economy and social justice should go hand in hand as the two sides of the same coin.
It is appropriate that the market economy, its pros and cons, should be revisited by the Prime Minister at a time the UNP is set to mark 40 years since its 1977 avalanche which ushered in the market economy. The revolutionary move, no doubt, unshackled the country from a moribund system taking it forward by leaps and bounds in trade, commerce and many spheres in the economy. The hitherto indigenous and inward looking economy of the socialist governments led by Sirima Bandaranaike was turned topsy-turvy by JRJ, opening the country's doors wide open to the outside world and the hustle and bustle of international trade. With the five sixth majority at his command, President Jayewardene was not restrained in his ambition to make Sri Lanka a regional economic hub. The facade of the country, its landscape, virtually changed overnight with giant projects and skyscrapers coming up in next to no time. Job opportunities were created through Free Trade Zones and other employment avenues opened its doors to the youth of the country through the heightened economic activity all round. In fact Sri Lanka was the first South Asian country to take the plunge vis-a-vis a market economy ahead of even giant India who later went onto adopt the system and is today a firm disciple of the open market economy.
The system, no doubt, had its critics and detractors, especially from the socialist school of thought, who were firmly of the view that it only succeeded in making the rich richer and the poor poorer through the exploitative mechanisms inherent in the system. Even the more moderate and middle of the road SLFP too viewed the open economy with a jaundiced eye, with the party advocating the total dismantling of the system in the event of returning to power. However CBK took a completely different view and was in favour of retaining the market economy albeit with a human face. However, upon taking the reins of power, Chandrika even surpassed the UNP in its unbridled consumerism and went onto private state ventures at a rate, even recalling back the Shell company to whom her mother showed the door when the latter was Prime Minister in the early sixties.
This iconoclastic daring by CBK prompted government MP Dullas Alahapperuma to remark that aanduwa vamata signal dala dakunata harawanawa (the government had signaled to Left and turning to the Right). But there was no turning back. The die had been cast. Even the more socialist oriented, national minded, Mahinda Rajapaksa too had no choice but to adopt the system against which he went on paada yatras and organsied jana goshas.
Be that as it may, the SLFP or SLFP led governments, thereafter, did not look back and stuck to the status quo, retaining the open economy- human face or not- which augurs well for the continuation of the national government as propounded by the Prime Minister. The views expressed by the PM of the need to make the market economy an all inclusive affair, not leaving out the poor and the marginalized from the system, no doubt, will also find resonance with the more socialist oriented elements within the Unity Government. True, there are glaring social disparities within the system and its exploitative nature came in for heavy flak even at the time the market economy was introduced by JRJ. The system also gave way to massive corruption, the creation of a corrupt society, and a drastic change in our social and cultural values, which have been accepted even by the ardent proponents of the market economy.
But the baby cannot to thrown with the bathwater. The world has moved at a frenetic pace since those halcyon days of socialism, with all national boundaries and barriers almost extinct. Russia and China had long ago come around to adopting the market economy even while dyed in the wool socialists, such as Vasudeva Nanayakkara, were railing against the system here in Sri Lanka. Hence it is difficult to attribute the alleged rumblings within the national government to ideological differences.
Therefore, the continuation of the national government, as the Premier has advocated, with the different schools of thought, and inputs, within the coalition, is the ideal way to move forward. Jettisoning the arrangement at this stage would indeed be counterproductive, when the government is only half way into its tenure and development programmes and other positive facets are just beginning to take shape, after fording through troubled waters.

Netflix now has 104 million subscribers worldwide
Netflix shares surged on Monday after the video streaming firm said it had about 104 million subscribers.
The US company said the better-than-expected number was a sign that investment in new shows and movies was paying off.
Netflix has produced shows such as 13 Reasons Why, about teen suicide, political drama House of Cards and The Crown.
Boss Reed Hastings said it was the rewards of doing great content.
Netflix shares rose more than 10% in after-hours trading in New York after announcing its second-quarter results.
The firm said it added about 5.2 million members during the quarter, mostly from overseas. International members now account for about half of its subscriber total.
Netflix has cultivated those audiences with movies such as Okja, a film made by one of South Koreas top directors about a young girls quest to recover a giant companion from a multi-national corporation.
The company also said it expected international members to help boost profits for the year - a first for that part of the business.
The growth helped Netflix to report a 32% rise in second quarter revenues to $2.8bn, and it expects revenues to reach nearly $3bn in the third quarter. BBC News

Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, the Director of Indo-Lanka Initiatives at the Pathfinder Foundation, delivered a special lecture titled 'Geo-Strategic Competition and Dynamics in the India Ocean: A south Asian Perspective' at a conference titled 'Security Challenges in Asia and Europe in 2017', jointly organized by Konrad Adenauer Stiftungs Japan office and the Japan Campus of the Temple University, held in Tokyo, Japan recently.
Admiral Colombages paper covered areas such as the geostrategic and geo-economic importance of the Indian Ocean, strategic significance of South Asia in the Indian Ocean, major maritime users and their dependence and focus on the Indian Ocean and arguments and counterarguments for a 21st century maritime silk route.
He also spoke on an Asia-Africa growth corridor, arms race and nuclearization of the Indian Ocean, spillover effects from Western Pacific Ocean, strategic convergence of India, USA and Japan and status of an unofficial maritime cold war in the Indian Ocean, threats posed by non-state actors and the strategic dilemma of smaller less powerful states such as Sri Lanka due to the strategic competition and influence of major players.
Admiral Colombage emphasized the importance of maintaining a rule-based maritime order to facilitate freedom of maritime commerce and freedom of over-fly in this ocean.
He also spoke about the need to maintain effective 'commercial diplomacy' by Sri Lanka and the possible role which can be played by Sri Lanka in coordinating maritime domain awareness (MDA) and developing a code of conduct for major maritime users in the Indian Ocean.
The potential and the desire of Sri Lanka to be the financial and maritime hub between Singapore and Dubai by leveraging the geostrategic location, without neglecting the geo-political and geo-economic realities and concerns was also highlighted during this lecture. This conference was conducted under the Social and Economic Governance Program of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung Japan Office and scholars and subject matter experts representing universities, research centres, think tanks and media organization from NATO, Canada, Italy, USA, UK, Germany, Japan, and Philippines presented papers based on three main themes.
These were 'German-Japanese security policy', 'Maritime security: a multi-dimensional global outlook' and 'Challenges in security cooperation: overcoming isolationism and unilateralism'.
On completion of the conference there was a discussion with journalists from the Yomiuri Shimbun, which is the largest circulated newspaper in Japan and another roundtable discussion at the Research Institute for Peace and Security (RIPS).
The main objectives of the conference and the follow up events were to examine recent trends in international security cooperation between global players in Europe and Asia, as well as changing security dynamics in the Asia-Pacific.
For the first time, the organizers wanted to focus specially on the Indian Ocean security as a connector to the Western Pacific.

Pepper cultivation faces loss due to immature pepper harvesting
The Export Agriculture Department has shown its grave concern over the pepper cultivation in the country. Export Agriculture Department Director General Dr. M. A. P. K. Seneviratne told the Daily News that a great loss of pepper harvest was being observed mainly due to the harvesting of immature pepper on large scale. He said, if the pepper pods get crushed or squashed when pressed hard with fingertips, such peppers are considered immature and not suitable to be plucked. Traders buy this immature pepper in bulk at cheap prices and sell them, mixed with half-ripe pepper and gaining exorbitant profits, Seneviratne added.
"This episode has resulted in the deprivation of 40 percent of the real pepper harvest in the country. It is reported that harvesting of immature pepper is practiced in many pepper-growing districts. This wrong harvesting practice shall be discouraged and we are on vigilance. During the first four months of 2017 alone, we have exported 1,242 MT pepper and earned a foreign exchange valued at 1,674.5 million," he said.
He said that the department has sought the assistance at all government agencies, Divisional Secretaries, Grama Niladharis and other field officers, to educate the pepper cultivators about the proper harvesting procedures and their benefits.

## Title: Plastics of future
## Supertitle:

Plastics of future
Why do we need oxo-biodegradable plastic
Because thousands of tons of plastic waste are entering the worlds environment every day, and will remain there for hundreds of years, unless collected for incineration.
How does it work
A very small amount of pro-degradant additive is put into the manufacturing process. This breaks the molecular chains in the polymer, and at the end of its useful life the product falls apart. The plastic does not just fragment, but will be consumed by bacteria and fungi after the additive has reduced the molecular weight to a level which permits micro-organisms access to the carbon and hydrogen.
Does it really biodegrade, or does it just fragment
When the material has reached the fragmentation stage it is no longer a plastic, and is biodegradable in the same way as natures wastes such as straw and twigs. The process continues until the material has biodegraded to nothing more than CO2, water, and humus, and it does not leave fragments of petro-polymers in the soil.
What does it cost
Very little, because the additive represents less than 3% of the product, and because the products can be made with the same machines and workforce as ordinary plastic.
Wont it put existing factories out of business, with loss of jobs
No, because customers can still use the factories which supply them with ordinary plastic products.
What types of biodegradable plastics exist
The two main types are oxo-biodegradable and hydro-biodegradable. In both cases degradation begins with a chemical process (oxidation or hydrolysis), followed by a biological process. Both types emit CO2 as they degrade, but hydro-biodegradables (usually starch-based) can also emit methane. Both types are compostable, but only oxo-biodegradable can be economically recycled.
Surely education is the way to solve the litter problem
Hopefully education will reduce the litter problem over several generations, but there is a lot of litter today and there will always be some litter. Action needs to be taken today to switch to oxo-biodegradable before millions more tons of plastic waste accumulate in the environment.
Isnt it better to recycle than to let it biodegrade
Yes, and one of the benefits of oxo-biodegradable plastic is that it can be recycled as part of a normal plastic waste stream However, if the plastic is not collected it cannot be recycled, so it needs to biodegrade instead of accumulating in the environment.
What about energy recovery
In some countries incineration is popular, and modern equipment is in place. Oxo-biodegradable plastic can be incinerated with energy recovery in the same way as conventional plastic, and has a higher calorific value than the hydro-biodegradable alternative.
Can it be composted
Oxo-biodegradable plastic does not degrade quickly in low temperature windrow composting, but it is suitable for in-vessel composting at the higher temperatures required by the new EU animal by-products regulations. Indeed it is likely that windrow composting will soon have to be phased out.
What happens to it in a landfill
Oxo-biodegradable plastics fragment and partially biodegrade to CO2 and water in the parts of the landfill where oxygen is present, but the residues are completely inert deeper in the landfill in the absence of oxygen. They do not emit any significant amounts of methane.
By contrast, hydro-biodegradable (starch-based) plastics will degrade and emit CO2 in a landfill if there is enough microbial activity. However, in the depths of a landfill, in the absence of air, hydro-biodegradable plastics generate copious quantities of methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas.
Does it contain heavy metals
No. It contains transition metal ions of Cobalt or Iron or Manganese, which are trace elements required in the human diet. They should not be confused with toxic heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, Cadmium and Chromium, which are never used in oxo-biodegradable plastics.
Isnt it made from oil
Yes. Oxo-biodegradable plastics are currently made from a by-product of oil or natural gas. These are of course finite resources, but the by-product arises because the world needs fuels, and would arise whether or not the by-product were used to make plastic goods.
Until other fuels and lubricants have been developed for engines, it makes good environmental sense to use the by-product, instead of wasting it by flare-off at the refinery and using scarce agricultural resources to make plastics. In fact plastics could reduce the amount of oil and gas imported because after their useful life they can be incinerated to release the stored energy, which can be used to generate electricity or to heat buildings.
Recently, interest has been shown in manufacturing sugar-derived polyethylenes. These, like oil-derived PE, are not biodegradable, but they can be made oxo-biodegradable in the same way as the latter, by the addition of a pro-degradant additive.
Does it leave any harmful residues
No. Oxo-biodegradable plastic passes all the usual ecotoxicity tests, including seed germination, plant growth and organism survival (daphnia, earthworms) tests carried out in accordance with international standards.

Poems
Enemy Within
The enemy within is to blame for your pain-To be sure, you must keep it at bay always and again!Patience keeps you free, yet even mine has limits,Be ever vigilant shall I- as love is within!Think now as a rational trier of facts, outwardly-Not must you hide behind your fear so cowardly!With great power comes great responsibility-To strengthen the human heart- fraught with fragility!Why would you allow your own self-destructionWhen diametrically opposed was such to our loves constructionOnly ever if you allow your mind to falterWould you remove we two from our loves altar! Think now of the decision you must make,As it is this that decides the road you must take!
Amarasena Ranasinghe

If
If ones life was dull and drearyEngulfed with drudgery every day,With no peace of mind,A little wish for happiness is wanting.If the environment you live inWas literally disturbed with sounds and music every day,Then there is a longing for silence and tranquility.If the world had no flora and fauna,With scorching sunshine everydayThe sweltering heat would be unbearable, andThe strain would be felt immensely,One hopes for coolness and plenty of rain.

SEARCHING
Searching through the crowds, You are not thereWatching at the clouds, I cant find you thereWalking in the midst of the cold breezeNot even the shadow or the embraceStanding under the rain dropsI dont feel you next to meWandering through, that little rose gardenEnlightening of every glorious momentLoads of memories reckon in my heartSearching all over without a single signPushing that pain into deep downI lie down, touching my heart so tenderlyu murmur darling dont look everywhere I am only here in your heart forever and ever

HARD TIMES
Hard times we all encounterAt some time in this voyage of life.Sunshine bright and warm,Rainbows beautiful and alluring,Storms reckless and glaring,Are usual while going through.Many phases, including hard timesWe have to encounter while voyaging through.It is a must to face them allFor never can we bypass a single.What cannot be cured, has to be enduredKeep this in mind when facing hard times.Cursing the Gods, lamenting or weepingIs no remedy to wipe away the troubles.Being positive, alert, and not getting disgustedWould make it better to slip through hard times.

While in school he visualised the fantasy of higher education. He entered the University of Sri Jayewardenapura then called Vidyodaya then that encouraged and motivated the resolute Sunil Ariyaratne, to prolong his artistic vocation. He received a First Class Honours degree specialising in Sinhala. He wrote a novel Jeewithaya geethayak wewa along with skilful Buddhadasa Galappaththi and Jayalath Monoratne published a poetry book Dolosmahe Pahana..

He had confided that though Sri Lanka is rich in Literature only fewer researches had been made. Some of his research topics were so unique and timely which won him a number of national and state awards.
He extensively researched and wrote a book on Baila and Kapirigngna for which he won a State literary award. For his publication on Grammar phone Era, Kerol pasam kantharu, Mahinda prabanda, Manawasinghe geetha prabanda, Purana sinhala nadagam Copy editing, Gandarwa apadana, Sinhala Chithrapati geethawali are also some of professors triumphant researches accomplished since year 1985.

He has also written a book on 10 acclaimed musicians in our country to pay homage to them. The book was titled Gandharwa Apadhana featuring Maestro musicians in the likes of R. Muththusamy, M.K. Rocksamy Mohammed Ghouse and Mohammed Sally.
Infrequent exploit
His exertions were vastly acclaimed in national and international media; The University of Visual and Performing Arts of Sri Jayewardenapura conferred Professor Sunil Ariyaratne his second Doctor of Literature honorary Degree in 2015, an infrequent exploit for any scholar.

It is learnt that the two Indian stars selected had been enormously precise.
Speaking about his selection of Indian stars to play the roles Siddharatha and Yashodhara( Lady of the Lotus), he had quipped that the Indian stars suit the roles better.
Professor had triumphed in the area for his lyrics for many songs where all our popular singers had done justice by singing gorgeously. Early in his career when he wrote a song for Pandit Amaradeva Bambara Petikke for the music of Victor Ratnayake, Master had inquired who is this hadaya who wrote the lyrics. Anyhow Professor continued to donate lyrics in the same vein had written hundreds of songs most of which had become trendy.

President, PM keen to continue Yahapalanaya
Lanka to rely more on trade and FTAs:
NFTH handed over to Government:
IMF, Oxford Business Group laud Sri Lanka:
High-profile arrests testimony to HR commitment:
The formation of the National Unity/Good Governance (Yahapalana) Government in January 2015 or to be more precise, August 2015, was a watershed moment in local political history. Except for a brief period of cohabitation almost 15 years ago (President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was in power when the UNP won the election in 2001), the two parties have not formally ruled the country together. The catalyst for this transformation was the defection of the then Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena to become the Common Presidential candidate in January 2015 against UPFAs Mahinda Rajapaksa, the then incumbent President. The election ended in a victory for Sirisena, who became President.
Both the President and UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe were under no illusion that a marriage between the UNP and the SLFP would be easy. The two parties hold disparate views on many issues, but the two leaders were firm in their conviction that the coalition should work to ensure the uplift of the nation. One problem was that while some of the SLFP immediately expressed their allegiance to President Sirisena, another group remained in the Mahinda Rajapaksa camp. They eventually morphed into what they called the Joint Opposition, though they were not officially recognised in Parliament. The Rajapaksa camp also formed a separate political party named Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna under the Flower Bud symbol. The former President, though officially not the leader of this party, is the prime mover behind it. Moreover, he has made no secret of the fact that he wants to regain power in some form since the 19th Amendment has again restricted Presidential term limits to two.
While some SLFPers in the National Unity Government were actually happy to see the back of the Rajapaksas, there were others who were always on the fence, with a foot in the JO camp. The differences between the UNP and SLFP camps have gradually widened, partly due to the machinations of the JO but also due to inherent differences between the two parties on certain issues, mainly economic ones.
A senior SLFP minister told this columnist on the condition of anonymity that most ministers and MPs in the President Maithripala Sirisena camp were not pleased about the UNPs handling of the economy, among other things. However, he noted that there was no immediate danger of a mass exodus to the JO side, though he did not rule out some defections. There is speculation that 18 SLFP MPs in the Government plan to cross over to the Opposition.
Consensual governance
The President has requested the SLFP group in the Government to hold on until December 31, which would be close to the third anniversary of his Presidential Election victory, with the idea that outstanding issues could be resolved within that period. Just like the President, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too is a passionate advocate of the national unity/ Yahapalana Government. Maintaining a national government in power is a difficult endeavour, but every effort should be taken to keep it going for the sake of the immense benefits which will accrue to the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a gathering in Pannipitiya. At a private function held later, the PM told his confidantes that the Good Governance Government must go on to realise the aspirations of the masses who voted them into power, despite consensual governance being a totally new experience. Many backbenchers in the UNP and several from other parties have assured fullest support to maintain the Government.
Both the SLFP and the UNP are gearing up for the Local Government polls which are now likely to be held towards the end of the year or in the first quarter of 2018. The Bill on the Local Government (LG) Elections would be presented in Parliament next week since all the affairs of the government with regard to the election have been completed, President Maithripala Sirisena said last week. He also said that although various politicians and sections of the media level allegations that the government is not holding the elections, what really has happened is that the Bill which was drafted on the election of members to the Local Government institutions previously had many flaws.
Despite the reservations of certain Government and Opposition MPs on the current state of the economy, Sri Lanka has earned a vote of confidence from the International Monetary Fund and the prestigious Oxford Business Group. The IMF Executive Board recently completed the second review of Sri Lankas Extended Fund Facility (EFF) arrangement, which enables the disbursement of about US$ 167.2 million. This will bring total disbursements under the arrangement to the equivalent of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) 359.682 million (about US$ 501.5 million). Sri Lankas three-year extended arrangement was approved on June 3, 2016, to the amount of SDR 1.1 billion (US$1.45 billion, or 185 percent of quota in the IMF at that time of approval of the arrangement. The governments reform programme, supported by the IMF, aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, rebuild foreign exchange reserves, and introduce a simpler, more equitable tax system to restore macro-economic stability and promote inclusive growth, the IMF added. Continued international reserves accumulation and enhanced exchange rate flexibility, to which the authorities are committed, would reduce Sri Lankas external vulnerabilities, it noted.
Economic potential
Earlier in the week, Sri Lanka and the World Bank signed a S$100 million credit agreement to support its higher education sector. The objective of this initiative is to increase enrollment in priority disciplines, improve the quality of degree programmes, and promote research and innovation in the higher education sector. The Accelerating Higher Education Expansion and Development (AHEAD) operation is the first in Sri Lanka to use the World Bank Programme for Results lending instrument.
The Oxford Business Group in its 2017 Report on Sri Lanka noted that a raft of new trade deals is set to unlock the islands economic potential. Structural and political issues have held back foreign investment in Sri Lanka in the past, but with new FTAs in the pipeline and a Government committed to attracting global investors to drive economic growth, the outlook is improving, the report said. The report gives a few key highlights, such as industrial exports increasing by 8.1'% year-on-year in October 2016 to US$ 655 million. Exports to India alone grew by 877% in just 13 years.
There is renewed momentum behind Sri Lanka's efforts to achieve its potential as a regional trading centre and an attractive place for investors from around the world. A strong emphasis on sectors in which it is particularly well-placed to grow such as logistics, garment manufacturing and tourism  are now starting to bear fruit, the Report said.
As the Oxford Group Report mentioned, Sri Lanka plans to sign several FTAs this year. The latest country to join this club is Bangladesh. (India was the first). This was announced during President Maithripala Sirisenas successful state visit to Bangladesh. (The President was accompanied by a business delegation). Although the Bangladesh economy is bigger than that of Sri Lanka, the balance of trade is currently in favour of Sri Lanka. The FTA will create a more level playing field and benefit both countries to raise their bilateral trade from the current US$ 100 million. More than 10 other agreements were signed by the two countries during the Presidents landmark visit.
However, a recent expose by the Daily News highlighted the pitfalls of falling for grandiose investment projects proposed by unknown and dubious companies. Headlined Tall Tale, it detailed a murky deal on a US$ 2 billion agreement signed with the Board of Investment (BoI) to build a 101-storey building complex in Colombo. (http://dailynews.lk/2017/07/11/local/121588/tall-tale). Our sister newspaper The Sunday Observer exposed another such project called the Horton Square, a purported 75-storey complex in Colombo.
Planning permission granted to Horton Square, branded as another mega estate project, launched with much fanfare in April this year, was rescinded last week by the Government, the newspaper disclosed. The decision to cancel the permission for the purported 75-storey project, in the former Asha Central land at Horton Place, Colombo 7, came in the wake of the World Commercial Centre fiasco where the Board of Investments (BOI) entered into an agreement with an entity whose credentials were not checked before the agreement was signed and no proper due diligence was carried out. BoI Chairman Upul Jayasuriya has resigned, citing personal reasons.
Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH)
One of the biggest local investment projects ever undertaken in the country is now in Government hands after Dr Neville Fernando agreed to hand over the hospital named after him to the Government. President Maithripala Sirisena witnessed the signing of the historic agreement in Malabe. This will now become a Government owned teaching hospital, with completely free care for the patients. A Government takeover of the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital (NFTH) was one of the demands of the anti-SAITM lobby, though the Government has stressed that the core structure of SAITM itself will see no major change. The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) has apparently given up the idea of striking willy-nilly after discussions with the Prime Minister and the Health Minister and also an open appeal by Prof. Carlo Fonseka not to make him a scapegoat for strikes. The Government has mostly kept its word, now the GMOA must be sporty enough to let the status quo prevail.
Many criticised the GMOA for striking during the dengue outbreak, which shows no sign of abating with nearly 90,000 patients reported. This week, our sister newspaper The Sunday Observer reported that the health authorities are planning to trial Rupatadine as a new drug to combat the deadly disease. Meanwhile, it was reported that Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop, slated to visit Sri Lanka this week, will announce Australian assistance to combat dengue fever in Sri Lanka. President Sirisena and I will announce Australian assistance to combat dengue fever in Sri Lanka and discuss progress on the implementation of Sri Lankas reconciliation process, which is critical to its long-term security and prosperity, Bishop said in a statement published by the Australian Foreign Ministry website, without elaborating on the kind of assistance that Australia plans to provide.
Garbage has often been mentioned in connection with dengue and the dogs that forage on the garbage have also been mentioned. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka sometime back stressed the importance of controlling the Citys stray dog population, but some individuals seem to have interpreted this as a carte blanche to kill dogs and even feral cats. One such incident was reported from the University of Moratuwa, where an unknown party (the university authorities have blamed a private contractor) had poisoned the dogs and cats who called the university their home. The students, who took care of the dogs and cats were heartbroken and posted pictures of the innocent animals on Facebook. An investigation is underway on the incident.
A similar incident occurred sometime back at the University of Sri Jayawardhanapura. The President has made it clear local authorities or any other establishment should not kill stray dogs and cats, but alternative methods should be found to control their numbers in view of rabies fears.
Amidst all the hullabaloo of politics and even the grim news concerning dengue, Sri Lankans love to turn to their one passion  cricket. The sport is on a sticky wicket in Sri Lanka after the one-day series loss to Zimbabwe. Although Sri Lanka managed to win the one-off Test by four wickets after a flip-flop performance, the one-day series loss was rather rattling, because it had the potential to rob the team of automatic qualification to the 2019 ten-team World Cup. Many sport and political commentators have lamented the politicisation of cricket especially during the previous regime for the start of the rot. Although many politicians have headed Sri Lanka Cricket in previous decades, there was no interference as such. It was during the late Minister Gamini Dissanayakes tenure that Sri Lanka gained Test status in 1981. Meanwhile, Minister and 1996 World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatungas comments on the 2011 World Cup Final (which India won) have stirred a hornets nest in both India and Sri Lanka, not to mention the controversies over Cricket Manager Charlie Austin.
High-profile arrests
Two recent high-profile arrests have reaffirmed the Governments commitment towards protecting human rights. Former Navy Spokesman D.K.P. Dassanayake was arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) in connection with the disappearance of 11 youths who had been abducted in Colombo and surrounding areas in 2008 and 2009. It had been revealed that the former Navy Commander Admiral Wasantha Karannagoda has wanted him investigated over the same issue. In the other case, Senior Deputy Inspector General Lalith Jayasinghe (last attached to the Central Province) has been arrested for allegedly helping a suspect (Mahalingham Sasikumar alias Swiss Kumar) in the rape and murder of schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vithya evade arrest in Jaffna. Jayasinghe was SSP Jaffna when the incident took place. Jayasinghe is the highest ranking serving police officer to be arrested, even though retired DIGs have been arrested previously, most notably Anura Senanayake.
Three experienced Tamil-speaking judges have been chosen by the Chief Justice to preside over a special trial-at-bar for the rape and murder of Pungudutivu student Sivaloganathan Vithya. The trial is being held at the Jaffna High Court, with Vavuniya High Court Judge Balasingam Sasi Mahenthiran leading alongside Jaffna High Court Judge Manikkavasagam Ilancheliyan and Trincomalee High Court Judge Annalingam Premashankar. This is the first such Trial-at-Bar in Jaffna, which witnessed civil unrest following the fleeing of Swiss Kumar. The Jaffna residents also protested against alleged moves to transfer the hearing of the case to Colombo.
Another case, this time heard in Colombo, is also making legal history. The Colombo High Court has re-summoned President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to appear in court on December 4, 2017, to give evidence in a case filed against Tissa Attanayake on charges of forgery. This is the first time that both the President and the Prime Minister have been so notified by a Court. This is the case where Attanayake is charged with displaying and reading from a fraudulent document at a propaganda meeting during last years presidential election in support of the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Attanayake, the then UNP General Secretary crossed over to the Rajapaksa camp at the last minute, citing the said document as one of the reasons for his decision to leave the UNP. His decision turned out to be tragically wrong for his political career and ambitions since Rajapaksa lost the election.

Programme to free workplaces from garbage
The programme, a workplace free of garbage, under the concept of Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha was initiated at the Ministry premises on July 14.
The aim of the programme is to maintain workplaces with favourable environments to overcome the garbage crisis and to eliminate the prevailing dengue epidemic. All the members of the ministry engaged in this programme. They cleaned the premises and disposed waste properly after segregating them.
According to the information received from the National Task Force Unit established by the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, many workplaces in urban areas have been found with dengue mosquito breeding places. Therefore, Minister Faiszer Musthapha initiated this programme to make all government and non-government work places dengue free.
This was initiated as a pilot project and will be implemented as a national programme immediately.

Promising ayurvedic remedies for kidney patients
The North Central Ayurveda Department has embarked on a healthcare programme for curing kidney patients using native drugs and treatment methodology.
Referring to the venture, North Central Ayurveda Commissioner Dr. Kumara Alwis told the Daily News that based on around six ancient indigenous prescriptions possessed by the late Gonagaldeniya Chittharamadipathi Ven. Waharaka Abayarathanalankara Nayaka Thera, the manufacturing of prescribed native drug packages is being commenced at the provincial ayurveda drugs manufacturing plant at Thelhiriyawa, Thambuttegama.
These indigenous prescriptions were donated by Dr. Nishanta Kumarasinghe, a senior lecturer at the Kothelawala Defence University and he himself is native of Kahatagasdigiliya in Rajarata to whom the prescriptions had been handed over in good faith by the prelate, for saving kidney patients.
It has been proven that these native drug packages are able to cure kidney diseases, after being tested at the kidney diseases treatment integrated clinic run by a team of western and ayurvedic doctors together. Results are most positive and encouraging.
The North Central Ayurveda Department has entrusted the manufacturing task of the said range of native drug packages to the provincial ayurveda drug manufacturing plant located at Thelhiriyawa in Thambuttegama, Dr. Alwis said.
"I appeal to the public to supply us raw herbs such as 'wal del' (wild breadfruit) roots, 'midella barks,' 'karamba leaves,' 'na' dalu (tender leaves), 'kalanduru ala' and 'pokuru wada,' as a meritorious deed to enable us to carry on with the kidney patients programme," Dr. Alwis added.
Herbal ingredients could be handed over to Anuradhapura Provincial Ayurveda Commissioner's office (TP: 025 2229357/58) or Thelhiriyawa drugs manufacturing plant (TP: 025 2056789).

K.G.G. Menike winning 65-70 age category 100m event with a NMR timing of 16.1 seconds
The veteran athlete couple from Kuruwita in Ratnapura district, K.G.G. Menike and R. A. Chandradasa once again created history by setting up two new meet records during the recently concluded fourth Masters' Athletics Championship at the Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Diyagama.
The Sri Lanka Masters' Athletic Association conducted the event as a selection trial for the forthcoming 20th Asian Masters' Athletics Championship in China.
Menike won a triple crown in all three participated events with a new meet record of 16.1 seconds in 65-70 age category 100metres, erasing her own previous record of 16.8 seconds set up in last year. She also won the same age category 200m gold and clinched her third gold in 5km race walk. Menike has an illustrious Master's athletic career and was named as the 'Golden Lady of the Meet' by Hindu news paper when she became the only women athlete to win six gold medals (100m, 200m, 80m hurdles, 300m hurdles, 4x100 relay and 4x 400 relay) at the 2006 Asian Masters' Athletics Championship in India.
Her husband, Chandradasa competing in the 75-80 age category toppled a seven-year-old meet record in 80m hurdles event with a timing of 19.1 seconds. The previous record of 19.3 seconds was established by R. A. Gunasekara in 2010. Chandradasa also won the silver medal of 200m and went on to grab the bronze medal in 100m event.
As an appreciation and encouragement for Menike's sporting excellence, Sabaragamuwa Province
Social Welfare, Probation and Child Protection, Rural Development and Rural Industries Minister Ranjith Bandara presented a spikes shoes pair to her during a felicitation ceremony at his office recently.
The sad part of the story is that even though the veteran husband and wife qualified for the Asian event in China with their record braking performances, both will not included in the national squad for China due to financial constrains.
"We are sure of bringing glory to motherland if compete in China, but we couldn't find sponsors to cover the tour expenses and missed the July 10 deadline to submit entries for Asian event. We have missed many international events due to the same reason over the years and quiet used to it now. Both of us shown a constant career progress, but as we are from a rural area with no connections to wealthy sponsors, we rarely get a chance to shine in international scene, " the couple explained. Chandradas and Menike are the oldest active Lankan athlete couple and has a sports museum, named 'Javana' at their residence showcasing trophies, cups and memorabilia of their long sporting careers.
Chandradasa said that the Sabaragamuwa Province Sports Ministry has allocated a land to construct a new building for the 'Javana' museum, but the construction work has stranded after laying of the foundation stone.
"Our house is very small and congested, so can be harmful to valuable memorabilia. We do not want to spend money on foreign tours, but will be very grateful if some one help to build the museum. Our only dream is to see the 'Javana' museum in a new proper premises, before one of us die," he revealed.

Relegation of powers would reduce conflict: Shan Wijeyalal
State Minister and Deputy Ministers in the consensus government have not been given any powers. As such they have been somewhat disappointed. This has created a false impression that certain problems have cropped up within the government, said Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva. He was addressing a meeting held in Galle on July 16. The Chief Minister said a majority of ministers in this government belonging to both parties had failed to assign part of their powers to the state and Deputy Ministers under their wing. This had created disappointment and problems. If all Ministers realise the fact that they belong to a consensus government and take steps to relegate some powers to their deputies, such problems and issues could be easily averted.
Chief Ministers Wijeyalal de Silva said SLFP Parliamentarians joined the government according to a division of the party's Central Committee. If they were to resign from the government, it too should be done as a group and not individually."They should not try to work according to private agendas outside any collective decision," he said. He said as rulers, they should not steer clear of people in a roughshod manner. They should heed criticism and be prepared to even take a step back without being hasty in their decisions. If this was done, the opposition would lose slogans and run out of steam automatically, he said.

Residents willing to settle LOUDSPEAKER case against Dhammaloka thera
The complainants who filed a private plaint against Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka of Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda for allegedly using loudspeakers in a manner of causing nuisance yesterday informed Court that they are ready for a settlement if Dhammaloka thera takes measures to minimise public nuisance.

The Court had made this order taking into consideration a private plaint filed by six parties including former Minister Milinda Moragoda and Centre for Environmental Justice alleging that loudspeakers used by Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka at Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Polhengoda was causing an annoyance and disturbance to the residents.
Through this private plaint, the six complainants sought the Courts jurisdiction to avert noise pollution taking place in the area in terms of the section 98 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The six complainants Gavinda Jayasinghe, Dr. Kalinga Kaluperuma, Diren R. Hallok, Milinda Moragoda, Kamalesh Johnpillai and Centre for Environmental Justice informed Court that they were compelled against their will to listen to the amplified sounds which emanate from the loudspeakers at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple. They said the authorities have turned a blind eye to their complaints made on several occasions.

Running out of space on your smartphone
Smartphones store so much data that it can be difficult finding somewhere to save it all! Gone are the days of storing your contacts and some low-resolution photos - now we have apps, games and large files to download, and storage space is running out.
If you find yourself running out of available storage on your phone, here are a few ways of freeing up some valuable megabytes. Click on the link below that matches your smartphone.
Expand your memory
Most Android handsets have a memory card slot to expand your storage with a MicroSD card. Likewise, many Windows handsets also take a memory card. Unfortunately, if you're an iPhone user this is one area where you'll miss out  your iPhone memory can't be expanded with any type of memory card.
If your phone does have a MicroSD slot, you could add as much as a whopping 256 gigabytes of extra space, depending on the specifications of your smartphone.
It's important to note that, for the most part, older Android smartphones can only use the microSD card for photos, videos and other media files. Some apps can be installed to a microSD card, but most will still install to your phone's memory. This means that if you need more space for apps, then a memory card may not provide a solution  but it could indirectly fix the problem by giving you somewhere else to store all your media files. Newer versions of Android (Marshmallow and Nougat), have a software feature called Adoptable Storage which fixes the problem, but whether your phone has it depends on the manufacturer - for example, the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge don't support the Adoptable Storage feature by default.
Things are a bit simpler with Windows Phones, which treat the microSD card as an extension of the internal memory - letting you install apps and games to your memory card without a hitch.
iPhone users are unlikely to get microSD support for their smartphones in the future  but you could consider items like the Leef iBridge external memory device. As Apple don't officially support expandable memory, gadgets like this do have their limitations and it's not as seamless as using a memory card would be  but depending on what you need, it may provide a way to move photos and videos away from your iPhone's storage, freeing up space for more apps and games.
Delete your unused apps
With literally hundreds of thousands of apps available across different handsets, you may quickly end up filling your phone with a huge selection of games, apps and widgets you never use! Browsing through your phone every so often and removing the apps you haven't used for a while is a great way of freeing additional space on your smartphone.
If youve purchased some of these apps, fear not. All purchases are managed by the account linked to your handset, whether that's an Apple ID, Gmail account or Windows account. If you want to install a particular app again at a later date, as long as you're signed in with your original account, you can simply download it again without being charged.
Back up your camerapictures
If you use your smartphone to take a lot of pictures, it's a good idea to back them up to your computer every now and again. Not only will this prevent you from losing any photographs if anything happens to your phone, but it also gives you the opportunity to delete them from your phone and free up some space.
Nowadays, most phones will have some kind of cloud service that allows you to back up your photos to online storage. From there, it's usually fairly easy to transfer them across to your hard drive  and even if you don't use whatever service your manufacturer provides, there are plenty of third-party options like Dropbox.
There's also the old-school way of connecting your phone up to your computer with a cable: most computers will automatically detect the phone as a camera and give you the option to sync your pictures. Your manufacturer may also have a dedicated software suite that you can install on your computer  however, these aren't always essential. - Geek Squad

Spore- SL FTA on the cards
Visiting Singaporean Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan will meet Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today after expressing the confidence of the Singaporean government to enter into a Free Trade Agreement with Sri Lanka before the end of the year.
Briefing the press after bilateral discussions held yesterday with his Sri Lankan counterpart Ravi Karunanayaka at the Foreign Affairs Ministry in Colombo, Singaporean Foreign Affairs Minister Balakrishnan said, one component of the conclusion of our negotiations for the Free Trade Agreement between Sri Lanka and Singapore is that we try to complete before the end of the year.
He said Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement will be a modern comprehensive high-quality and ambitious Agreement that will demonstrate to the world that both two countries are open for business and that we welcome foreign investments.
We believe should the envisioned FTA should enter into force, Singapore can serve as Sri Lankas gateway in South East Asia, and Sri Lanka, our gateway in the Indian Ocean, he pointed out and added This will be an example of a win-win outcome for both sides.
During our discussions Minister Ravi Karunanayaka suggested that Sri Lanka should pursue a hub diplomacy,which will be open to the rest of the world.
I comfortably agree with Minister Karunanayaka on the subject because Sri Lanka indeed is a hub of transshipment and economic ties across the Indian Ocean, he said. .
Singapore is a hub in South East Asia. We are complementary, but not competitive.
He said, bigger the pipeline we build to connect these two hubs, Sri Lanka and Singapore, greater the opportunities we will have created for us in the region, he said.
I am encouraged to see the rapid developments in Colombo and to see how the government is capitalizing this by pushing reforms and economic engagements with the rest of the world, he said.
Because of this there is a there is a surge of interest on the part of Singapore companies in Sri Lanka because they can see for themselves the growth potential in this place. In fact there are more than 350 Singaporean companies currently in Sri Lanka engaged in activities in wide range of sectors including food and beverage, manufacturing, IT, cyber security and power, he said. We hope to see more of these business to business collaborations,Minister Karunanayaka added.
He said, Incumbent on both governments is the need to create conducive climate for businesses. The businesses look forward towards stability, predictability and reliability. We have reached a conclusion to enter into a Singapore - Sri Lanka FTA before the end of the year.
Singapore is happy to play a modest role in supporting the Sri Lankan governments development and reform agenda.
Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayaka said, he and his Singaporean counterpart Balakrishnan discussed on various areas of mutual interest to both countries including economic and development corporation between the two countries, tourism, people to people contact ,cultural corporation, defense and maritime corporation, reconciliation as well as corporation in the region.
We discussed particularly on the proposed Sri Lanka Singapore FTA to be signed before the latter part of 2017. The Singaporean government has conveyed their confidence and the commitment to enter into it.
I expressed my deeper appreciation for the trading opportunities offered to Sri Lanka by Singapore, the minister said.
We conveyed the investment opportunities available for Singapore in the ongoing mega projects in the country, such as the Colombo International Financial City Project, Western Province Megapolis Development Project and Trincomalee District Development Project, said Karunanayaka.

For just political solution to national question:
Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan yesterday called for the two main parties to set aside their differences and come together to work out a just political solution for the national question.
Addressing the media after a closed door meeting with the Singaporean Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr.Vivian Balakrishnan at the Office of the Opposition Leader, Sampanthan stressed, A just political solution must come, and it is only through that there will be real change in the lives of the people and trust will be rebuilt to live in this country.
As long as they fight with each other, this problem will not be solved,said Sampanthan who discussed the current political climate with the Foreign Minister and asked that the international community support them in this process.
The Opposition Leader had also taken the opportunity to discuss issues related to land, political prisoners, missing persons, livelihoods and employment issues in the North.
Bring about some development in our region and we will work with you. Our youth especially need to be trained for employment and if you can think of any programme, you can provide them with the acquisition of skills, it would be most useful,said Sampanthan to Dr. Balakrishnan as the latter presented him with a book titled An Encyclopaedia of the Sri Lankan Diaspora.

SHORT STORY: moving Horror!
It was a rainy day in the usual sunny and humid city of Colombo. The rain usually brings in more chaos at after office time making the tired and the stressful to almost lose their minds. Admits the vast traffic in Rajagiriya, in a new Honda Vessel jeep, Kanishka was waiting anxiously to get home. It was Thursday, the penultimate day of the week where people are tired but also has hopes for a fast Friday and to a relaxing weekend.
Kanishka worked in the banking sector and was in the middle management. He recently got married to Navenka and it was an arranged marriage. Navenka was a newly passed out doctor and was attached to the Colombo general hospital. She too drove to work and was faced with the same situation with traffic and rain. They lived in Malabe down Welivita road passing a controversial private education institute.
The area has a unique pleasantness as it is a little further away from the busy activity of Malabe town. The newly married had just moved in to this area and it has been just a week. They were able to find a good looking house with three bed rooms and two bathrooms and had a small lawn as well. This was ideal as Navenka always had an idea of getting a pet dog.
Kanishka came home at about seven in the evening after battling it out on Colombos streets with ill-disciplined tuk tuks and bus drivers and exhaustion was very much evident on his face. To his surprise, Navenka had already come home. He found out that Navenka had left a little early today and had come home by five and also had prepared dinner. This made Kanishka feel a little joyful and he went off to have a well-earned wash after giving a kiss on the forehead of his wife. After dinner they wanted to watch a little TV but due to rain and lighting they couldnt do that as well. Suddenly the lights went off startling the couple for a bit and then Kanishka cautiously walked from the dining table to find a torch. Just when he found it the lights came back on. Nevertheless he kept it close to him as there might be another power outage. The couple decided to turn in early today and they went to brush their teeth.
The master bed room was on the second floor and has an attached bathroom. Both of them, especially Navenka was a neat freak and kept the house in an immaculate condition.
They were brushing their teeth when the lights went off for the second time. But this time Kanishka had the torch with him and turned it on.
The light was unintentionally focused by him on the toilet mirror which reflected from it and beamed behind Navenka who at that time was about to reach for the sink. Suddenly she saw something dark moving in a blink of an eye from behind them. Navenka screamed and panicked which startled Kanishka as well. Whats the matter questioned Kanishka in a loud concerned voice. I... I saw something moving behind us replied Navenka in a shaky voice. Kanishka focused the torch to the back of them and didnt see anything. At this point the lights came back on. Theres nothing here dear replied Kanishka while thoroughly examining the bathroom. Its probably my imagination replied the wife while washing her face off. Kanishka took a peek outside the toilet and made his way towards their bedroom and grabbed a cricket bat. Whats that for asked Navenka. Just to be safe Ill take a look and come. I locked all the doors as usual and we have iron grills on the windows and cctv cameras responded Kanishka while gripping the bat with both his hands. Dont leave me here. Im coming with you said Navenka and both of them took a brief look at the house just to double check. To their relief there was absolutely nothing and they decided that it was a long day for the both of them and rest will make things right and went off to bed.
Next day the couple was getting ready to go to work and Navenka was packing two lunches for the both of them. Kanishka was putting on his tie when he witnessed through the reflection on the dressing table mirror a blackish green smudge on the wall behind. He stared into the mirror to comprehend what it was and then realized that it was on the wall behind him. He quickly turned back but to his amazement there was nothing there but only the white wall. With a confused look he turned back to the mirror which didnt show nothing of the previous. Kani  Navenkas pet name for Kanishka are you readyWe are getting late yelled the wife while getting in to the car. Today Kanishka will be dropping his wife at work.
The weather had subsided and left very thing wet and muddy. Kanishaka after combing his hair came out side to the car poach and realized that he had left his wallet and ran back inside to his house to fetch it. Navenka who had already gotten in to the car figured that her husband had probably forgotten something and took her eyeliner out to do some last minute touch ups in the car. She turned the rear view mirror towards her and started on the eyeliner and just as she was done she saw a faint outlining of a man standing behind the car. She abruptly looked back and it was Jayasinghe, the old beggar who wonders on their road constantly babbling. He was just standing their staring at the house.

Singapore praises Presidents reconciliation efforts
Singaporean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan said the efforts made by President Maithripala Sirisena to strengthen reconciliation in Sri Lanka are laudable. Stating this when he called on President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday, he said that he would visit Jaffna to donate books to the Jaffna Library and to sign an agreement to provide training facilities to the library staff. Singapore will also provide training facilities and set up a professorship at the Orthopedics Department of Jaffna Hospital.
The President thanked Singapore for providing such assistance to the Jaffna Library and Jaffna Hospital.
The President also recalled that Singapore and Sri Lanka have maintained excellent bilateral ties since ancient time. He also thanked Singapore for assisting Sri Lanka at the international forums during the conflict in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Balakrishnan immediately quipped that whatever Singapore was providing to Sri Lanka was only a repayment of intellectual endowment received from high standard Sri Lankan professionals who augmented Singapores progress over the years.
Dr. Balakrishnan said there is immense potential to increase Singaporean investments in Sri Lanka. He said this in reply to President Sirisenas comment to him about the investment opportunities available in tourism and hospitality sectors for investors from Singapore. The Singaporean Minister said that Singaporean investors could also look at other sectors like energy, water, education and technology. Already there are over 300 Singaporean investments in Sri Lanka.
Expressing his appreciation of Sri Lankas international relations, the Minister said, as a small nation living among powerful big neighbours, countries such as Singapore and Sri Lanka have to always maintain extra vigilance on power balance and external relations.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Secretary to the President, Austin Fernando, Foreign Secretary, Esala Weerakoon and Singaporean High Commissioner S Chandra Das were also present.- Presidents Media Division

Small miracle
A smile is a facial expression where the corners of the mouth are turned upward. A smile could be a gesture of recognition, or an expression of friendly acceptance be it be a person one meets, or any animate or inanimate object that gives a feeling of joy. An indication of ones inner feelings.
A smile is universal. In any language, race or creed it carries the same message. One can listen to atrocious gossip, slander with a smile and a nod while subtly judging the nature of the narrator. It could be sign of genuine gratitude end humanness.
Some display permanent smiles. Beautiful! Many who meet such persons forget their inner turmoils for some time.
The eyes show the essence of a smile. Come to think of it even eyes of our faithful canines show their smile by wagging their tail, whines with eyes of love. It is the same with meow and the affectionate caress. A smile originating from a donor is always accepted by the recipient with a smile.
At times make persons to smile, in order to make fear or anxiety to disappear. This is graphically shown in the smile of a passenger when he or she misses the holding strap in a bus, or holds on to a shoulder of a seated passenger.
Cartoons in the media, on the mega and mini-screens, pictures in childrens books show humour and friendship with the corners of the mouth turned upward. Yes! a smiling happening. Of course we cannot restrain a smile when listening to our politicians. Even the moon and the blazing sun is depicted with a smile, with their mouths turned upward. They show anger and sadness when their mouths are turned downwards.
Then there is the diplomatic smile. At times a very disarming smile while his country is arming.
Nat King Coles That Certain Smile takes us back to the enigmatic smile of Leonardo deVincis Mona Lisa. That smile in the painting  makes it the most expensive smile in the world.
Then come the songs of yesteryear, that make the smile the hero. Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and smile, smile. Theres a smile on your face Brother John. And when Irish eyes are smiling. Incidentally, they had not known about the Sri Lankan smile when the last song was written.
Devotees sing, pray, cry and dance before the smiling faces of their Celestial Teachers. The faces of our teachers in pictures and statues are shown with a smile. So forgiving and compassionate.
A smile is not a laugh. A guffaw is also a smile. A bawdy joke, antics of humans and animals that we encounter and many films, and cartoons make people to laugh. Yes! even the Hyena could laugh. It is only a genuine smile laced with love, sympathy, empathy and feeling that can bring the best in a human being.
At the funeral of a middle class gentleman, mourners were amazed to see all seeking alms by the sidewalks of a very famous temple queuing to pay their respects by the bier. A very few carried. Some in wheel chairs. They had brought tears and smiles from the others when they had said we are here today not because of his benevolence. He smiled at us with a bow. How we loved that smile. It was worth more than all the alms we receive. Now we will not be able to see that smile. They wept.
Then again, at the state funeral of a head of a State Department members of all the political parties mentioned about the genuine, contagion smile of the departed person in their eulogies. Of the same person, the sanitary orderly or sweeper had said when Sir gets down from the car and wishes me with a smile, all my trouble are forgotten.
A smile has no boundaries. No wonder that smiles is the longest word in the English language. There is a mile between the two ss. Smile S. it has no distance. It was a gracious Secretary General of the UN. Late U. Thank who said when you are born, everyone around you is happy and is in smiles. Let your life be such, that when you die, all around you cry and you are serene in death with a Smile on your face.
A beautiful saying for all time.

The growth of the indices in 2017 reflects a reversal of the declining trend from a 9.66% and 5.54% decline in the Benchmark ASPI index in 2016 and 2015 respectively.
Overall trading activity has also improved in 2017, with the Daily Average Turnover recorded for 2017 (year-to-date) marking an improvement to Rs. 911 million from Rs.737 million in 2016.
The market in 2017 has garnered a keen interest among foreign investors, with net foreign inflows for 24 consecutive weeks recorded from the first week of February onwards.
In another remarkable development, the foreign purchases figure recorded for the first half of 2016 (January  June) amounting to Rs. 31.5 billion has doubled during the first half of 2017 to Rs. 62.6 billion - an all-time high for foreign purchases in the first half of a calendar year.

An attractive market valuation (P/E) compared to regional peers, growing corporate earnings among listed entities and a strong performance of the ASPI compared to leading indices are defining factors in attracting foreign investments to the Sri Lankan capital market.
Commenting on the development, CSE CEO Rajeeva Bandaranaike stated Growth in foreign activity is certainly encouraging and goes on to indicate that foreign investors have identified an opportunity in the Sri Lankan stock market.
Such interest is an expression of confidence in the future potential and growth of our listed entities, the market and the Sri Lankan economy at-large.

Sri Lankas first international junior golf Cship at RCGC
Big boost for grassroot level golf:
Sri Lanka Golf Union in collaboration with HSBC will conduct the first ever international junior golf championship in Sri Lanka on August 10 at the Royal Colombo Golf Club (RCGC) with the participation of teams from Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and host Sri Lanka. The international junior tournament is the final event of a triangular junior golf promotion campaign foster by HSBC, including the first ever HSBC Future Lions programme and HSBC Junior Golf Championship. This was revealed to the media during a press briefing at the RCGC recently.
The Sri Lanka International Junior Golf Championship is a team championship where a team will comprise six under-18 golfers, including four boys and two girls. HSBC, the global banking giant and a golf promoter who sponsor some of the top annual golf events across the globe has joined hands with SLGU as the sponsor for this milestone event. HSBC has a long rooted history with Sri Lanka golf, being sponsors for HSBC 5 Club and HSBC Premier golf championships.
SLGU president Priath Fernando thanked HSBC to help in this endevour and went on to say that SLGU will invest a lot in grassroot level golf development, as it will be the future of countrys golf. We had only one annual junior event five years ago, but with the introduction of two Regional Junior events including a Match Play event, junior golf in Sri Lanka is experiencing a big boost. We also introduced junior rankings and lifted the junior segment to international standard. This magnitude of events will surely enhance Sri Lankas golfing profile in the international scene. We also hope our juniors will reap the maximum from the two tournaments and regional training programmes, he concluded.
Niloo Jayatilake, the chair person of SLGU Junior SubCommittee explaining tournament format said that they have introduced a hybrid version, going on par with international standard for the team contest where the morning session will be worked off to select the two best teams on Gross score. The afternoon session will line up the best two teams for the final match play contest to determine the winners.  We have arranged an individual contest, the HSBC Junior Golf Championship on August 9 with the aim to provide more competition opportunity for junior golfers across the country. There will be four age category divisions, namely, 15-18+years (Gold Division), 12-14+years (Silver division), 10-11+years (Bronze Division) and 9 years and under (Copper Division). As we have seen youngsters perform impressively at open events locally and internationally in recent times, organizers took the decision to accept juniors in senior divisions despite their age, allowing potential juniors to sharpen their talent at a higher level, she said.
Speaking about the HSBC Future Lions programme, SLGU Schools Golf Development Committee chairman Dirk Flamer Caldera said that they will conduct this programme between August 1 to 5 at four distant locations in the island, namely Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Anuradhapura and Welisara (Navy Aqua Range) as one-day basic training sessions, aiming grassroot level (8 to 15 years) freshers who would like to take up to golf.
The sessions will be conducted by a top notched junior coach, Anil Perera who is a US PGA qualified trainer. This is a very important programme as it will help popularize golf and pick talented golfers who will be the future golfing stars of Sri Lanka. We have invited government and international schools in close proximity to these regional venues and hopefully large number of students will participate in this introduction programme, he explained.
The HSBC Head of Marketing and Communication, Tharanga Gunasekera revealed that they are very happy to be a part of this historic event as the bank plays a leading global role in promoting golf.
Golf is a fast growing sport around the world and we are committed in taking golf to masses. We like to see golf becoming everybodys sport, he said.
Cinnamon Life (Hospitality partner), MAS Kreeda (Apparel partner), Imorich by Elephant House, Olu tropical water and Callaway Golf (golf gear partner) support the event as co-sponsors.
Schools and parents can gather information about the events through tel. no. 0714327343 (Duminda) while the HSBC Premier clients can register through their respective relationship managers for events.

Sri Lanka crickets faithful servant
Rangana Herath has been the national cricket teams faithful servant for the past seven years notably following the retirement of Muthiah Muralitharan after which he managed to secure a permanent place in the side. As long as Muralitharan was around and bowling his team to victory after victory Herath remained on the sidelines forced to bide his time.
But the long wait has been rewarding for once the great man quit the scene Sri Lanka didnt have to look any further than the left-arm spin of Herath to plug that gap.
The big question here is who will Sri Lanka turn to after Herath retires Have they groomed someone to fill his big shoes The answer is no. There have been several spinners in the fray but none have been tried out at Test level.
One cricket fan commented: Sometimes I shudder when I think what will happen after Herath retires.
He is spot on with that comment.
Another fan commented: I dont care how strong or weak your FC system is, it is unthinkable that someone with 500 FC wickets has not played for his country. He was referring to another left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara who has 558 wickets in 99 first-class matches but still has no place in the team.
Sri Lanka has the right-arm leg-spin of Jeffrey Vandersay who has been tried out in one-day matches and the left-arm chinaman of Lakshan Sandakan who has played five Tests and a handful of one-day games. They have also tried out the left-arm spin Milinda Siriwardana and the off-breaks of Tharindu Kaushal over the past three years but none have been given a consistent run to consolidate their positions.
Selection for Test sides has not gone beyond Herath and Dilruwan Perera and the latter who is 34 might also go out of the game the same time as Herath which could be a double blow. Herath and Perera have complimented each other whenever they have played together especially at home and the pair has proved to be quite a successful combination.
Now after seven years as the main spearhead and having bowled his country to several memorable victories Herath is nearing the end of his career and at 39 although he is fit and spritely on the field and can reel off 70-80 overs in a Test how long he can continue to play at the highest level is a matter of conjecture. In order to extend his Test career Herath quit playing in the one-day format (ODIs and T20Is) shortly after the World T20 in April 2016.
In the recently concluded one-off Test against Zimbabwe in addition to carrying a heavy load in bowling, Herath was seen manning the offside boundary all day long and the way he moved about in the field put to shame some of the players younger than him.
When Herath quit one-day cricket he said, I have not set any goals for myself. Whenever I have played for my country, I have always wanted to see how best I could contribute to win. That has been my approach all the time. It would be a big achievement if I can get to 300 Test wickets, but after that, I dont see any goals that I can pursue.
Despite his surgically repaired knees Herath has kept going and in his own way has entered his name in the record books as the most successful left-arm spinner in Test history having gone past New Zealands Daniel Vettoris tally of 362 wickets in 34 lesser Tests (79 Tests to Vettoris 113).
Herath is now nearing 400 Test wickets  something which he wouldnt have dreamt of when he got to 300. His recent haul of 11 wickets for 249 runs against Zimbabwe has taken his overall tally to 384 wickets from 81 Tests. Among all left-arm bowlers only Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram is ahead of Herath with 414 scalps.
At the moment Sri Lanka cricket is struggling to come to terms with losing some of their legendary stars like Jayawardene, Sangakkara and Dilshan. With fast bowler Lasith Malinga also on the wane in the one-day format Herath remains Sri Lankas only hope of salvaging something out of the wreckage the countrys cricket has fallen into. But his efforts alone cannot resurrect the fortunes of a fallen team unless others also pull up their socks and contribute.

The event titled Strong Legislatures as a Bulwark Against Autocracy was co-hosted by HDPs Chairman Congressman Peter Roskam and Ranking Congress member David Price.
Ambassador Prasad Kariyawasam was invited to share Sri Lankas experiences of how strong legislatures create stable governments and the critical role of the Parliament in the evolution of Sri Lankas democratic practice and reforms.
The Ambassador briefed on the developments since the 2015 Presidential and Parliamentary elections and as to how the democratic political transformation set in motion in the country has contributed to strengthening Sri Lankas relations with the international community, including the United States. Links with United States have in turn been reinforced through collaboration between the legislatures of Sri Lanka and the United States, facilitated by the HDP.
The opening remarks at the event were delivered by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who is at present the Chairperson of the National Democratic Institute. Other speakers included former Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte, Vice President of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Thomas Carothers, former Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations Jim Kolbe, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Acting Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development Wade Warren.
The House Democracy Partnership is a bipartisan, twenty-member, commission of the U.S. House of Representatives that works directly with 21 partner countries to support the development of effective, independent, and responsive legislative institutions.
The Partnership is assisted by the U.S. Agency for International Development, the International Republican Institute, and the National Democratic Institute.
The Sri Lanka Parliament and the House Democracy Partnership launched a Collaboration Agreement to strengthen partnership between the two legislatures in September during Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas visit to Washington D.C. Several exchange programmes have taken place since, including a HDP congressional delegation led by Chairman Roskam visiting Sri Lanka in February.

Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that had the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) not assisted the United National Party (UNP) to form the unity government, minor parties including the TNA, which would have assisted to form this Government, may ask for a lions share.
The Minister made these remarks while addressing the SLFP weekly media briefing at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
Minister Samarasinghe said the unity government obstructed the bargaining power of the minority parties.
There is political stability in the country owing to forming this unity government. The political stability helps attract foreign investments, he added.
The Minister added that the decision whether to quit from the Government will be taken by the Central Committee or the Executive Committee of the SLFP but not individually.
The decision to form a unity government was also taken by the Central Committee of the party and the decision for the departure should also be taken by the Central Committee considering the consequences by December this year, he said.
He noted that moves are underway to form an SLFP led Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena by 2020.
We will contest at next elections including the 2020 General Election under the SLFP or UPFA banner. We dont contest with the UNP as each party has their own journey and identity he said.
He said that under the leadership of President Sirisena, the SLFP is in progress. SLFP supporters have understood that they should be with the party rather than be with certain persons.
There should not be two leaders at a party. Mahinda Rajapaksa, who offered the party leadership to President Sirisena, should not pull the leg of the present leader of the party.
Mahinda Rajapaksa has failed at two elections and it indicated that majority of people are not with him. Then he should not obstruct the present leader. Rajapaksa should let the party leader to bring the party forward. If Rajapaksa forms any new party while splitting the SLFP, other parties especially the UNP will get the advantage of it, he said.
Minister Samarasinghe added that they are with the party unlike the parliamentarians of the Joint Opposition.
We ask the persons in the joint opposition to come to the party as they are outside the party now, he said. Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said she will not quit the Government even if certain media reported that she is going to quit the Government with 18 others.
Housing and Construction Deputy Minister Indika Bandaranayake refuting media reports also said that he will not leave the Government alone but the final decision is to be taken at the CC of the party. He said that he is satisfied with the ministerial activities as the Government has allocated a huge amount of money for his ministry.
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Deputy Minister Tharanath Basnayake said that after the two year period, the CC of the SLFP will take the decision to stay or leave the Government. But he has no idea to leave the Government at this juncture.

Success story of bone marrow transplants
All 10 bone marrow transplants by the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit of the Maharagama Apeksha Hospital in the last six months have been successful, Unit Specialist Dr Prasad Abeysinghe said.
Patients needed to go abroad to get a transplant done earlier. It would cost Rs. 4-5 million, he said. The Health Ministry provides antibiotics needed by the patients.
Dr. Abeysinghe said the operations were done according to the international standards. He had a team of 16 including four specialist doctors trained in Australia, five nurses, another four doctors and laboratory technicians.
The operations were started in December 2016.
The Presidents Fund provides Rs. 300,000 for all tests to be made before the operation to the needy.

A Tenacious Explorer of Abstract Surfaces
As a child growing up in Tehran, Mirzakhani had no intention of becoming a mathematician. Her chief goal was simply to read every book she could find:
As an 8-year-old, Maryam Mirzakhani used to tell herself stories about the exploits of a remarkable girl. Every night at bedtime, her heroine would become mayor, travel the world or fulfill some other grand destiny.
Today, Mirzakhani a 37-year-old mathematics professor at Stanford University, still writes elaborate stories in her mind. The high ambitions havent changed, but the protagonists have: They are hyperbolic surfaces, moduli spaces and dynamical systems. In a way, she said, mathematics research feels like writing a novel. There are different characters, and you are getting to know them better, she said. Things evolve, and then you look back at a character, and its completely different from your first impression.
The Iranian mathematician follows her characters wherever they take her, along story lines that often take years to unfold. Petite but indomitable, Mirzakhani has a reputation among mathematicians for tackling the most difficult questions in her field with dogged persistence. She has a fearless ambition when it comes to mathematics, said Curtis McMullen of Harvard University, who was Mirzakhanis doctoral adviser.
With her low voice and steady, gray-blue eyes, Mirzakhani projects an unwavering self-confidence. She has an equal tendency, however, toward humility. Asked to describe her contribution to a particular research problem, she laughed, hesitated and finally said: To be honest, I dont think Ive had a very huge contribution. And when an email arrived in February saying that she would receive what is widely regarded as the highest honor in mathematics  the Fields Medal, which will be awarded today at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul, South Korea, she assumed that the account from which the email was sent had been hacked.
Other mathematicians, however, describe Mirzakhanis work in glowing terms. Her doctoral dissertation about counting loops on surfaces that have hyperbolic geometry, was truly spectacular, said Alex Eskin, a mathematician at the University of Chicago who has collaborated with Mirzakhani. Its the kind of mathematics you immediately recognize belongs in a textbook.
And one of Mirzakhanis more recent contributions, a monumental collaboration with Eskin about the dynamics of abstract surfaces connected to billiard tables is probably the theorem of the decade in Mirzakhanis highly competitive field, said Benson Farb, also a University of Chicago mathematician.
Tehran
As a child growing up in Tehran, Mirzakhani had no intention of becoming a mathematician. Her chief goal was simply to read every book she could find. She also watched television biographies of famous women such as Marie Curie and Helen Keller, and later read Lust for Life, a novel about Vincent van Gogh. These stories instilled in her an undefined ambition to do something great with her life, become a writer, perhaps.
Mirzakhani finished elementary school just as the Iran-Iraq war was drawing to a close and opportunities were opening up for motivated students. She took a placement test that secured her a spot at the Farzanegan middle school for girls in Tehran, which is administered by Irans National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents. I think I was the lucky generation, she said. I was a teenager when things got more stable.
In her first week at the new school, she made a lifelong friend, Roya Beheshti, who is now a mathematics professor at Washington University in St. Louis. As children, the two explored the book stores that lined the crowded commercial street near their school. Browsing was discouraged, so they randomly chose books to buy. Now, it sounds very strange, Mirzakhani said. But books were very cheap, so we would just buy them.
To her dismay, Mirzakhani did poorly in her mathematics class that year. Her math teacher didnt think she was particularly talented, which undermined her confidence. At that age, its so important what others see in you, Mirzakhani said. I lost my interest in math.
The following year, Mirzakhani had a more encouraging teacher, however, and her performance improved enormously. Starting from the second year, she was a star, Beheshti said.
Mirzakhani went on to the Farzanegan high school for girls. There, she and Beheshti got hold of the questions from that years national competition to determine which high school students would go to the International Olympiad in Informatics, an annual programming competition for high school students. Mirzakhani and Beheshti worked on the problems for several days and managed to solve three out of six. Even though students at the competition must complete the exam in three hours, Mirzakhani was excited to be able to do any problems at all.
Eager to discover what they were capable of in similar competitions, Mirzakhani and Beheshti went to the principal of their school and demanded that she arrange for math problem-solving classes like the ones being taught at the comparable high school for boys. The principal of the school was a very strong character, Mirzakhani recalled. If we really wanted something, she would make it happen.
The principal was undeterred by the fact that Irans International Mathematical Olympiad team had never fielded a girl, Mirzakhani said. Her mindset was very positive and upbeat that you can do it, even though youll be the first one,  Mirzakhani said. I think that has influenced my life quite a lot.
In 1994, when Mirzakhani was 17, she and Beheshti made the Iranian math Olympiad team. Mirzakhanis score on the Olympiad test earned her a gold medal. The following year, she returned and achieved a perfect score. Having entered the competitions to discover what she could do, Mirzakhani emerged with a deep love of mathematics. You have to spend some energy and effort to see the beauty of math, she said.
Even today, said Anton Zorich of the Universit Paris Diderot-Paris 7 in France, Mirzakhani gives the impression of a 17-year-old girl who is absolutely excited by all the mathematics that happens around her. Harvard
Gold medals at the mathematical Olympiad dont always translate into success in mathematics research, McMullen observed. In these contests, someone has carefully crafted a problem with a clever solution, but in research, maybe the problem doesnt have a solution at all. Unlike many Olympiad high-scorers, he said, Mirzakhani has the ability to generate her own vision.
After completing an undergraduate degree in mathematics at Sharif University in Tehran in 1999, Mirzakhani went to graduate school at Harvard University, where she started attending McMullens seminar. At first, she didnt understand much of what he was talking about but was captivated by the beauty of the subject, hyperbolic geometry. She started going to McMullens office and peppering him with questions, scribbling down notes in Farsi.
She had a sort of daring imagination, recalled McMullen, a 1998 Fields medallist. She would formulate in her mind an imaginary picture of what must be going on, then come to my office and describe it. At the end, she would turn to me and say, Is it right I was always very flattered that she thought I would know.
Mirzakhani likes to describe herself as slow. Unlike some mathematicians who solve problems with quicksilver brilliance, she gravitates toward deep problems that she can chew on for years. Months or years later, you see very different aspects of a problem, she said. There are problems she has been thinking about for more than a decade. And still theres not much I can do about them, she said.
Mirzakhani doesnt feel intimidated by mathematicians who knock down one problem after another. I dont get easily disappointed, she said. Im quite confident, in some sense.
Her slow and steady approach also applies to other areas of her life. One day while she was a graduate student at Harvard, her future husband, then a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, learned this lesson about Mirzakhani when the two went for a run. Shes very petite, and I was in good shape, so I thought Id do well, and at first, I was ahead, recalled Jan Vondrak, who is now a theoretical computer scientist at IBM Almaden Research Centre in San Jose, Califonia. But she never slows down. After half an hour, I was done, but she was still running at the same pace.
As she thinks about mathematics, Mirzakhani constantly doodles, drawing surfaces and other images related to her research. She has these huge pieces of paper on the floor and spends hours and hours drawing what look to me like the same picture over and over, Vondrak said, adding that papers and books are scattered haphazardly about her home office. I have no idea how she can work like this, but it works out in the end, he said. Perhaps, he speculates, that is because the problems she is working on are so abstract and complicated, she cant afford to make logical steps one by one but has to make big jumps.
Doodling helps her focus, Mirzakhani said. When thinking about a difficult math problem, you dont want to write down all the details, she said. But the process of drawing something helps you somehow to stay connected. Mirzakhani said that her 3-year-old daughter, Anahita, often exclaims, Oh, Mommy is painting again! when she sees the mathematician drawing. Maybe she thinks Im a painter, Mirzakhani said.
Next Chapter
Mirzakhani is the first woman to win a Fields Medal. The gender imbalance in mathematics is long-standing and pervasive, and the Fields Medal, in particular, is ill-suited to the career arcs of many female mathematicians. It is restricted to mathematicians younger than 40, focusing on the very years during which many women dial back their careers to raise children.
Mirzakhani feels certain, however, that there will be many more female Fields medallists in the future. There are really many great female mathematicians doing great things, she said.
In the meantime, while she feels greatly honoured to have been awarded a Fields Medal, she has no desire to be the face of women in mathematics, she said. Her ambitious teenage self would have been overjoyed by the award, she said, but today, she is eager to deflect attention from her achievements so she can focus on research.
Mirzakhani has big plans for the next chapters of her mathematical story. She has started working with Wright to try to develop a complete list of the kinds of sets that translation surface orbits can fill up. Such a classification would be a magic wand for understanding billiards and translation surfaces, Zorich has written.
Its no small task, but Mirzakhani has learned over the years to think big. You have to ignore low-hanging fruit, which is a little tricky, she said. Im not sure if its the best way of doing things, actually, youre torturing yourself along the way. But she enjoys it, she said. Life isnt supposed to be easy. Quanta Magazine

Tense situation at Hikkaduwa Sri Sumnagala Madya Vidyalaya
A tense situation arose at the Hikkaduwa Sri Sumangala Madya Vidyalaya on July 17 when a group of its past pupils opposed a national coexistence festival arranged at the school for the day.
Nearly 200 students from four surrounding schools had arrived for the festival. Sumangla Vidyalaya Principal GH. Mohotti had invited teachers and students of the Gintota Zahira Vidyalaya as well for the festival.
Sumangla past pupils said it was improper to hold co-existence festival at the school founded by Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera. They said even a Vesak festival or a New Year festival were not held at the school to date.
The principal saidt the festival was held following a co-existence lesson found in the year 8 class text book as instructed by the Education Ministry. But the old boys and parents said a festival of this nature should be held in a Muslim school but not in the historic Sumangala Vidyalaya.
They said students of Gintota Zahira Vidyalaya were to attend the event but if they come, they have to worship the Schools Buddha statute offering flowers. The principal said they held the coexistence festival sans Zahira Vidyalaya students.

Tobacco, areca nut based products banned from today

Centre for Research in Oral Cancer Director Professor W.M. Tilakaratne said that all products containing tobacco and areca nut are banned from today in Sri Lanka.
He said this addressing a press briefing at the Government Information Centre in Colombo yesterday.
The amended Tobacco Products Regulations Act, Gazetted on September 1, 2016 bans the manufacture, import, and sale of smokeless tobacco products, e-cigarettes containing tobacco, and flavoured, coloured, or sweetened cigarettes.
With this, the sale, manufacture, promotion and importation of products including tobacco and areca nut will be banned, Prof W.M. Tilakaratne said.
Furthermore he said that selling betel with smokeless tobacco and areca nut is banned and strict action will be taken against tobacco products such as Babul, Pampara and Bita.
He said that these decisions were made with the rise of death relating to oral cancer in Sri Lanka.
Around four people die in Sri Lanka per day, of diseases related to chewing tobacco, he said.
He also said that oral cancer is the most common type of cancer in Sri Lanka.

Treasury Dy. Sec. not aware of meetings held for cash shortfall
Treasury Bond Commission:
The Deputy Secretary to the Treasury S.R. Attygalle yesterday said that he was unaware of any meeting held regarding an additional cash requirement that the government encountered in the first quarter of 2015.
Attygalle made these observations while being questioned by Arjun Mahendrans lawyer Chanaka de Silva on a series of meetings which were held with regard to a borrowing requirement to fund road development contracts given by the previous regime without having made any allocations.
The questions were posed after Attygalle on July 17 gave evidence to the Treasury Bond Commission stating that there was no additional borrowing requirement for the month of February 2015.
De Silva asked Attygalle whether he was aware that the Economic Subcommittee of the Cabinet met on February 24, 2015 to discuss the shortage of money to fund road development projects which were at the time on hold. Attygalle said he did not know about such a requirement nor did he know about such a meeting.
De Silva then asked if Attygalle was aware of another meeting held on February 26, 2015 at the Central Bank to which several ministers including the then Finance Minister and the Highways Minister participated in. De Silva told Attygalle that the discussion in the meeting was the same fund requirement for the road development projects which were on hold.
Attygalle said he was unaware of such a meeting as well.
The Deputy Secretary to the Treasury was testifying for the second day at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, yesterday. Representative of former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran, lawyer Chanaka de Silva led evidence for the day.
De Silva then asked if Attygalle was aware of another meeting which was held on March 3, 2015, between the then Former Finance Minister and the contractors of the said RDA projects, Attygalle denied knowledge of such meeting.
De Silva also asked if Attygalle knew of a committee headed by Daya Liyanage, which was appointed to look into the Fiscal Responsibility Management Act and submit a report, the witness said he does not know of such a committee. De Silva then referred the witness to a letter produced by his client on May 16, 2017 which was signed by then Finance Minister. Attygalle said he has not seen the letter before.
After Attygalle confirmed that the signature in the letter was of former Finance Minister, De Silva asked whether he has a reason to doubt the content of the letter sent by the former Finance Minister. Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera then rose to object the question. De Livera pointed out that Chanaka de Silva cannot ask a question of this nature.
Chairman of the Commission, Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri said that Attygalle cant answer that question and overruled the question.
De Livera told De Silva that he should ask relevant questions, to which the latter was quick to say that I am asking the relevant question but not the relevant question you want me to ask.
De Silva also requested De Livera to sit who had not yet taken his seat after he rose to object De Silvas question.
De Livera then promptly replied I will sit when I want to sit while De Silva squeezed in a Thank you into the squabble.
De Livera then retorted, You cant dictate me. De Silva not to be outdone shot back You cannot dictate to me either.
De Livera then said I can to which De Silva replies with a You cant.
After the two lawyers threw several more I-cans and you-cants to the squabble, Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena intervened in the argument.
Justice Jayawardena asked What kind of an argument is this between two senior counsels and requested both to stop the argument.
Chairman of the Commission, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri requested De Silva to rephrase the question and De Silva complied. During the re-examination by the Attorney Generals panel Attygalle said if the Central Bank failed to fulfill the monthly borrowing requirement of the government, the General Treasury will look into other options to realise the short-fall. He explained that generally when such a short-fall occurs the General Treasury will utilize its overdraft financial service or postpone possible transactions for the next month. Pan Asia Banking Corporation Deputy General ManagerRichard Aruna Dias will testify before the Treasury Bond Commission today (18).

Trump and Putin had 'secret' second chat at G20

Donald Trump had a second, previously undisclosed, conversation with Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit earlier this month.
The White House said Trump and Putin had attended a dinner with G20 leaders at the recent Hamburg summit.
After the meal, Trump had walked over to the Russian leader for a conversation not previously disclosed.
But Ian Bremmer, President of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, said Trump had left his seat during the meal and spent about an hour talking "privately and animatedly" with Putin.
Bremmer was the first to report what he described as a meeting in a note to clients.
The White House, however, disputed this, saying: "There was no 'second meeting' between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner."
Trump wrote on Twitter: "Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is sick. All G20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!"
Bremmer replied to him: "Press didn't know you spent an hour during dinner in 1-1 discussion with Putin (and his translator). Other G20 leaders found it...unusual."
Putin's translator was the only other person present during the conversation between the pair but there was no translator for Trump, something Bremmer described as a "breach of national security protocol".
An unnamed White House official said that both men used the Russian translator as Trump's translator did not speak Russian.
The G20 leaders had only been allowed to have one translator attend the dinner with them, the official said, adding that, because Trump had been sitting next to the wife of Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at dinner, his translator was for Japanese.
The US and Russian Presidents met for the first time on 7 July and, during their two-hour meeting, Putin reportedly denied allegations that he had been behind efforts to meddle in last year's presidential election.
The news comes amid a number of investigations into the possible Russian interference and also whether the Trump campaign team were linked to the activity. Trump has denied this.
Meanwhile, the White House has announced that Trump will nominate Jon Huntsman as US ambassador to Russia.
Huntsman has served under five US presidents and was also a candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, dropping out of the race following a third place in the New Hampshire primary.
He was an envoy to China between 2009 and 2011 under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.
The news will come as little surprise, as the former governor of Utah had long been tipped as Trump's favourite for the role.

Way forward for Sri Lankan diplomacy
Higher education promotes a common language and understanding that other forms of diplomacy cant. Higher education typically influences people at a critical time of their life  intellectually and socially. Governments have been using higher education to advance their own international strategies for decades. Most of these strategies involve the exporting of higher education to other nations. However, in recent years, developing nations have also seen the advantage of importing education from well-regarded institutions and higher education sectors. How successful these endeavours have been, however, remains in question.
Considering the global landscape of higher education for more than a century, many governments and government-affiliated organisations in the developed world have invested in programmes that use higher education as a tool for public diplomacy. These programmes served a variety of purposes from facilitating student and faculty exchanges, fostering multi institutional academic partnerships, and expanding understanding (and possibly acceptance) of one culture into others.
Many of the endeavours were identified globally in this context. The United States, United Kingdom and France both allocated funds to bring students from former colonies to study at their colleges and universities. Creation of Alliance Francaise, which was organised in 1883 in France and now operates in many parts of the world helps to achieve their mission of spreading the French culture and language, the British Council, the Fulbright programme of United States are some of the initiatives recognised globally. On the other side of the globe, the Colombo Plan, created in 1950, initiated international cooperation between countries in Southeast Asia and resulted in a rapid build-up of foreign students studying in Australia and New Zealand. The efforts spurred by the Colombo Plan resulted, in 1969, in the creation of IDP Education Australia, charged with providing educational assistance to other nations in the Asia-Pacific region.
Student exchange programmes
The most well-known use of higher education in international relations is through student exchange programmes. In the United States, the Fulbright programme, founded in 1946, funds the exchange of students, scholars, and teachers in multiple nations. The US is not the only nation to fund such initiatives. The German DAAD and British Council, for example, also administer similar student exchange programmes. In addition, some nations have specific scholarship programmes that target high achieving international students.
The Australian Development Scholarships programme, which works in cooperation with foreign governments, provides international students with funding to study in an Australian institution. Other programs such as the Chinese Government Scholarships Programme, the United Kingdoms Chevening Programme, the U.S. Edmund S. Muskie Graduate Fellowship Programme, and Germany Study Scholarships and Research Grants provide merit -based funding for foreign students to pursue their studies in the respective nations.
Marketing campaigns
Many of the countries at present have embarked on a relatively new endeavour on formal marketing of their higher education sector similar to how Private sector create brands, these nations are pursuing strategies to highlight their educational offerings programmes such as Study in Germany, Study in Australia, and Education UK seek to inform prospective foreign students about the strength of and opportunities within their higher education system. These initiatives also help lower the barriers to access by providing students with the information they need to identify an institution, gain admission (if merited), and negotiate the student visa process. Many of the states take higher education as a states responsibility. In the United States, there are multiple marketing campaigns in many of the states such as Study New York, Study Oregon, and Study Maine to attract international students to study within their state.
Sri Lankan cultural centres in foreign missions and in universities
Another public diplomacy strategy used by governments is to sponsor cultural centres in foreign lands, many of which are located at foreign colleges and universities. For example, the Russkiy Mir Foundation, founded in 2007 by the Russian government, is charged with promoting the Russian language, as Russia's national heritage and a significant aspect of Russian and world culture, and supporting Russian language teaching programmes abroad. The Foundation funds Russian centres located at foreign educational institutions and provides support for the teaching and learning of the Russian language and culture outside of the Russian borders.
The German Goethe Institute operates cultural centres in 25 countries to support the acquisition of the German language and promote international cultural exchange. In addition, China, starting in 2004, began expending significant resources to support the teaching of Chinese language and culture in other countries through their Confucius Institutes. Further, Indian council for cultural relations plays a vital role in attracting foreign students being a South Asian Country and extending a helping hand to many of the students to realise their higher education dreams with a mingle of cultural exchange in their lands which is an excellent initiative.
There are attempts of exporting higher education offerings either by bringing foreign students to study at their institutions or to send their own cultural centres to other nations. Further, governments in recent decade adopted another phenomenon on importing higher education institutions from other nations such as in the Middle East and East Asia, South Asia.
Universities in Canada through its diverse programmes in Canada aim to activate a dynamic community of global leaders across Canada and the world and create lasting impacts through cross-cultural exchanges encompassing international education, discovery and inquiry, and professional experiences. Through their networks, they aim to strengthen university linkages with industry, community and international partners, explore new opportunities, and better position Canadian universities to engage in solutions to complex global development challenges. They identify scholars who show leadership potential and supporting them in acquiring world-ready research experience through a university, in collaboration with a non-profit organisation or industry.
Sri Lanka waste many of its precious time of its public and future generation on strikes, fulfilling unions political agendas which do not cater the student outcome at all.
The higher education could contribute a lot to the service sector. Sri Lanka could position well in higher education in the global landscape if a collective effort is taken with academics and administrators in a harmonious relationship in every endeavour. With the collaborative efforts with Ministry of foreign affairs and Ministry of Higher Education through public private partnership these strategies in higher education could be well developed in introducing student exchange programmes, the establishment of Sri Lankan cultural centres attached to foreign missions and Sri Lankan universities. It is a high time to raise policy dialogues with the stake holders to position Sri Lankans higher education and its rich heritage globally.
There are internationally demanding programmes in Sri Lankan universities such as quantity surveying of university of Moratuwa where the Sri Lankan potential has been identified in the Middle East due to the efforts made by the Sri Lankan Academia. These rich potentials need recognition and sustainability in the global higher education landscape. Sri Lankan visual and performing arts, indigenous medicine as well as architectural capabilities need to have exchange and need to open up avenues for foreign nations. Renewed commitment from government, smart resource allocation is vital in this regard.

Wildlife Department warns against setting fire to forests
The Wildlife Department has warned those who purposely set fire to government forest reserves, forests, jungles and thickets these days will be arrested and produced before Courts as both human beings and wild animals have severely become helpless due to the existing dry weather patterns in the country.
These days, fires would spread fast due to the environment being dry. Setting fire to forests and forest reserves would destroy wild animals as their habitats too would be ruined.
The nearest Forest Officer or Police station should be informed of such moves, as it is a national responsibility. About 150 wildlife assistants have been deployed countrywide to be on the alert to setting fire to forests purposely, said W. E. Jayathilake, Kurunegala District Divisional Secretary speaking to the Daily News.

POLAND: There is much to celebrate about the warmth of our relationship today ... Polish is now the second most spoken language in the United Kingdom, with a generation of young people growing up who feel both British and Polish, William added at the reception.
Such links  diplomatic, military, cultural  offer much promise and opportunity for the future.
After landing in the Polish capital with their children Charlotte and George in tow, William and Kate walked through the old part of town shaking hands and posing for photos with fans carrying Polish and British flags.

But William and Kate have also got a chance to experience modern-day Poland, as they met with young entrepreneurs at the top of a Warsaw skyscraper on Monday.
They will also tour the new Gdansk Shakespeare Theatre, where a meet-and-greet with actors dressed in Elizabethan costumes is planned.

Zimbabwe rue on Dickwella decision
Zimbabwe were left ruing on a third umpires decision that may have cost them the one-off Test against Sri Lanka which they lost by four wickets at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Niroshan Dickwella was on 37 when he missed a ball from spinner Sikandar Raza and wicket-keeper Regis Chakabva brought off a stumping in the 73rd over. Zimbabwe fielders appealed confidently. The onfield umpires went upstairs to the third umpire for a decision and after several replays he ruled Dickwella not out. Sri Lanka at that point were 253-5.
From what I saw I honestly didnt see any doubt why he (Dickwella) should be not out. But its just one of those things. If youve got technology and it clearly shows then, it happens to us quite a lot. We feel it is tough when those things go against you, especially when you are trying to win a Test match on a last day, said Zimbabwe skipper Graeme Cremer at the post-match press conference.
Despite the disappointment of coming so close to recording their maiden Test win against Sri Lanka, Cremer said he was proud of his team and the way they played.
I am very proud of the way the guys played to win an ODI series here and then to push them in the Test match and almost beat them and take it to all five days into the fifth afternoon. Its a good effort from our boys, said Cremer.
I dont think it was so much of inexperience we knew Sri Lanka had to play well to get 388 especially batting on the last day and I thought our bowlers tried hard. We may have missed a few opportunities we thought the stumping of Dickwella could have gone our way and it didnt. But its just one of those things. Sri Lanka played well to bat on the last day like that.
We thought 388 was going to be tough especially on the last day. We had picked up three wickets yesterday so we needed to pick up seven today. It has been a sort of a rollercoaster to the motions but I am still proud the way the guys played and the way they fought. Overall I am happy the way the tour went, he said.
Cremer said the mood in the dressing room after the match was one of disappointment. We got together and said we should be proud of the way we pushed Sri Lanka having won the ODI series and pushed them in the Test match. It is disappointing because it could have gone either way. It would have been great to win a Test match here but it wasnt to be.
Cremer said that on this performance in Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe would push to get more international matches now with Afghanistan and Ireland becoming full ICC members.
Even before this Test match our MD said he wanted to push for more Test cricket and more cricket in general. We have shown that we can push big teams even away from home, said Cremer.
We have West Indies coming to us for two Tests in October. We got a longish break without international cricket again. Well hopefully get something in between if we can but we are still comfortable because we are playing in Zimbabwe and we are confident of pushing them.
We are hoping that we get more matches against Afghanistan and Ireland and that well get to play more and that they will be competitive teams. - ST

Media has important role to play in building national integration
The media has an important and strategic role to play in building national integration and peace building, National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary V. Sivagnanasothy said.
He was addressing a workshop for journalists organised by the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena recently.
Three sensitization workshops were organised in the Colombo, Kandy, and Kurunegala Districts to advocate reconciliation friendly media to journalists by the Ministry and over 150 journalists discussed the Role of Media in conflict transformation, reconciliation, and peace building at the workshops. The Ministry under the direction of President Maithiripala Sirisena has developed a Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) and reconciliation friendly media has been identified as an important initiative.
The discussions by the journalists highlighted that based on the international experiences in Kenya the media spread hate messages which created atrocities and led to genocides in early 1990s. Subsequently, the Kenyan government established a team to monitor hate-speeches on social media. Such conflict Barometers with number of high-intensity conflicts helped track the progress on peace building which helps journalists to report on the peace status of the country.
The media influences on shaping perceptions, condition behaviour and impacts the minds, attitudes, emotions of readers and community at large. The journalists at the discussion pointed out that the cultural, ethnic and religious diversity be respected while fair and non-discriminatory reporting is a prime responsibility of them. Journalists are truth tellers but the media has a moral responsibility to promote reconciliation. Discipline in reporting on conflict related issues were considered as important by many professionals. The workshop discussed that conflict sensitive journalism focuses on democratic, pluralistic and just society. The peace journalism is where editors and reporters make choices about what to report and how to report - to create opportunities to value non-violent responses to conflict. The discussions highlighted that Peace Journalism is seen as a special mode of socially responsible journalism which contributes to peaceful settlement of conflicts. Journalists can be part of the solution rather than part of the problem. The role of Journalists as a neutral disseminator be objective, impartial, integrity, ensure fairness, and balance in reporting. Journalists openly discussed that their professionalism gets eroded due to personal emotions, interest, prejudices, audience preference, lack of ethics, concern for being overly market oriented or economic oriented, influenced by negativism or influenced by elite groups or one-sidedness or socially irresponsiveness and failure to look at diverse perspective. The Journalists concluded the careful presentation of facts, reliable and varied sources, experts opinions, supporting documents, accurate quotations and fair representation of major view points are vital for a balanced journalism. The media helps to create political setting, policy setting and public opinion which help to bridge gap between perpetrators of conflict and victims.
The sensitization workshop concluded that the journalist's professional responsibility of independence, objectivity, impartiality and truth telling and fairness are fundamental while the social responsibility and public interest demands peace journalism and reconciliation friendly media that focuses on journalists being a part of the solution to the problem and help build sustainable peace, harmony and national integration and reconciliation, V. Sivagnanasothy, said.
National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M. Fowzie, Bakeer Markar Centre for National Unity Chairman Imtiaz Bakeer Markar and Senior Government Officials, several journalists and academics participated.

30th Death Anniversary of H R Jothipala: Jothipala's journey
On July 7, 1987, the entire nation was shocked to hear unbelievably the sad news on the sudden loss of Singer/Actor H.R.Jothipala, the Legend of the era. It was a sad end of a golden voice that had captured the hearts of young and old both locally and overseas. His indomitable melodious voice opened a new era of music with everlasting songs still popular in the country and abroad.
His name is so popular that even after 30 years, his songs are still sung by other singers and amateur singers at reality shows, musical evenings, commercial records etc. The miraculous fact is that the name of this innate talented singer with an unsurpassed singing excellence and incredible humility still shines at the zenith of its glory even after thirty years of his demise.
This is a tribute to Jothipala on his 30th Death Anniversary which has been commemorated on July 7, 2017, covering significant stories of his singing life.
Playback singer
Born on 12th February 1936 in Ketawalamulla, Dematagoda, Colombo to a middle-class family, this future giant play-back singer Hettiarachchige Reginald Jothipala or H.R. Jothipala displayed his innate talents of vocals since his boyhood. His mother was H K Podinona Perera and fatherHettiarachchige Reginald Jamis was a tailor by profession. He studied at St. Lawrence College, Maradana and St. Johns College, Dematagoda. As the family did not own a radio, he was tempted to visit a Tea Kiosk in his area very frequently to listen to music. Since his salad days, he was fondly called by abbreviated name Jothi which later became incredibly popular.
There are many stories spread on the first step of Jothi s entry into Music Field or Kala Lokaya. According to the information gathered from a soulful facebook page called Supembara Jothi created by a certain group of his fans led by Harindra Lakmal, first, the formal attempt was participating the completions conducted by Ceylon Broadcasting ( Now Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation ).A book named The Dignitary of Malays has quoted that the famous musician late Stanley Omar was in the same room with Jothipala in Maligakannda, Maradana and Jothipala was introduced to Ariyadasa Pieris by Omar for an opportunity to sing in Adhunika Peya.
Adhunika Peya conducted by Ceylon Broadcasting (Now SLBC) and sponsored by Regina Losingers Company in 1952 was his first step in his endeavour which became incredibly a success. One of the hot favourite Hindi film songs Sukriya sung by Talat Mahamood was the song sung by Jothi at this competition for which he was awarded the first place with a parcel of sweets from the sponsors. Subsequently, in presenting his innate indisputable singing skills at Jayagrahaka Pelapaliya, he was crowned the Best Singer for which he was awarded a Parker 51 pen by the organisers.
His first song thotiyo thotiyo was mainly sung by Wasantha Sandanayake in the latter part of 1954. It was only three words thotiyo thotiyo thotiyo sung by him. However Lebeiee Sithalada Ale Kale is considered as his first full song sung with G.S.B.Rani Perera in 1954. Again in 1955, he sang a duet Ada Ada Eyiee Maruwa with Wasantha Sandanayake in 1955. Jothis first solo was  Mage Ran Rajaniee with the music of Stanley Omar in 1955.
There is a very interesting story on Jothis entry to Music world (Kala Lokaya). This story was told by Darshani Chandrasena, the daughter of R.A. Chandrasena, a legendary maestro Music Director who introduced a number of singers who later rose to the apex of popularity. The significant factor is that this story was told by Darshani with the historical documents including a letter written by Jothi in his own handwriting as proof of evidence to a true story.
Opportunity
A get-together of a musical evening ( Peduru Sajje ) was organised by famous journalist Sisira Kumara Manikkaarchchi at his residence Nugegoda on 13th February 1953 on the occasion of the popular female playback singer G.S.B.Rani Pereras marriage with Anton Perera. Music was directed by the great musician R.A.Chandrasena. At this friendly event, an invitee who was a famous personality from Maradana introduced a young amateur singer to Anton Perera and requested to give him an opportunity at this evening. It was a magnificent opportunity for this amateur to impress not only the audience but also R.A.Chandrasena by his masterly performance of singing with his mellifluous voice. He was none other than H.R.Jothipala who later became the indomitable playback singer in Sri Lanka.
Since then Jothipala became closely attached to Chandrasena and Sriyani Chandrasena who treated him as their own son. The letter written by Jothipala in 1954 to Chandrasena who was in India for Mathabhedaya recordings addressed as My friend and Teacher is a case in point. He in early days always respected both Chandrasena and Mrs Chandrasena at his best.
Chandrasena in recognition of Jothis talents continued to help sing at his fully packed musical events like Chathurangani and Panchangani and also selected him to sing in his films.
Chandrasena selected Jothipala to sing in the Film Mathabhedaya directed by B.A.W. Jayamanne. It was his first experience of Chandrasena as a Music Director of a film directed by himself. B.A.W. Jayamanna mostly preferred to use Mohideen Baig as the male voice in his films. One day Chandrasena visited B.A. W.s residence with Jothi to discuss music on film Mathabedhaya with a hidden objective to make a path to young Jothipala to enter play back singing of films.
Chandrasena was so nice to influence B.A.W. Jayamanne for young singer Jothipala to sing in Mathabhedaya directed by B.A.W. Jayamanna in 1955. Chandrsena took much interest in having rehearsals with Jothi for the song Ginnaki Hada Mage  at his own home. Chandrasena requested Jothi to get prepared to fly to India for recordings. As advised by Chandrasena Jothi reached Ratmalana Airport on a specific date with his bag and baggage but he did not have his passport. His ignorance, unfortunately, missed a golden opportunity that would have changed his singing career in becoming the playback singer for Mathabhedaya.
Adverse comment
His determination to traverse against numerous challenges with strength and courage helped him achieve his potential. These stories begin with film Perakadoru Bena. He was then later selected by the Music Director B.S.Perera to sing in Perakadoru Bena, a chance he again missed by an adverse comment made by film director A.B.Raj who dismissed his voice as unsuitable for recording.
Failing to sing in Mathabhedaya and Perakadoru Bena, Jothi was introduced by musician T.F. Lathif to Film Director Sirisena Wimalaweera . Jothi was invited by Sirisena Wimalaweera to sing a duet with G.S.B.Rani Perera in the film Podi Putha. He missed this opportunity too as his voice was decided unsuitable after audition by the Sound Engineer and Sirisena Wimalaweera. On release of the film, he went to watch the film proudly with his friends. He was surprised to notice that Haroon Lanthra and Rani Perera had later recorded the song  Oh Kiri Muhuda Kalamba for the film.
Jothis dream to be a playback singer became a reality with the release of Surathalee in 1956, a triumphant achievement of a long experienced struggle through hurdle after hurdle. Once when Jothi approached the Giant Film Producer Jabir A.Cader with the support of Jothis influenced friends, Carder had asked Jothi to see him back with a recorded song before he decides the suitability of the voice. Reputed Musician Stanley Omar was so generous to encourage Jothi with Rs.35/ which was high in value at the time. Jothi was able to do a recording accordingly. In recognition of his talented skills in vocals after listen to the song, Cader generously opened the avenue of opportunity to sing in Surathalee, a film produced by Carder.

Altairs structural engineer explains high-rise design principles at Colombo forum
The complex correlation between reinforced concrete shear walls, steel frames and outriggers in modern skyscrapers was demystified by one of the worlds leading structural engineers at a professional forum in Colombo recently.
Using case studies of some of most remarkable high rises under construction around the world, Predrag Eror, Principal of Derby Design Engineering and the Structural Engineer of Altair, explained how structural design principles enable tall buildings to sway with no compromise to their integrity.Eror was an invited speaker at Vision for High Rise Buildings  3 organised by the Society of Structural Engineers Sri Lanka (SSESL).
His presentation on Structural Systems for High-rise Buildings was attended by 240 engineering professionals and students and included an hour devoted to questions and answers.
I was impressed with the depth of interest in the subject and the enthusiastic engagement of the audience, Eror said. Naturally, there was extra interest in the design elements of the Altair building, which is one of a kind, and one of the most interesting constructions I have been involved with in my 30 years as a structural engineer.
The six buildings presented as case studies in complex design principles were 2020 Tower in Dubai (300 metres; 63 floors), Tiara United Towers also in Dubai (225 metres; 62 floors), Crescent City Tower in Baku, Azerbaijan (210 metres; 43 floors), Vida Dubai Creek Harbour building (210 metres; 52 floors), Mina Seyahi Le Meridien Hotel extension (127 metres; 31 floors) and Altair in Colombo (230.1 metres; 68 floors).
Eror is the structural engineer for all of these edifices. While explaining the design principles and laws of physics that apply to the commonest types of structural systems followed in the construction of high-rise buildings, Eror said that the structural engineers responsibility is not only to design the structure for permanent loading conditions, but to provide the initial idea on how the building is to be constructed, develop methods of construction, check all stages of construction, and actively work and assist the builder during the construction process.
With Altair for example, Derby Design Engineering was involved even before the architect was appointed, and has been engaged in testing and monitoring every stage and element of the construction, including piling, floor slabs, staircases and bridges, Eror said, disclosing that in-depth research was conducted into high-grade concrete, as a result of which Altair was built with a concrete conforming to the highest British standard, a grade previously unused in Sri Lanka.
Altair consists of two structures, one a 230.1 meter vertical tower and the other a tower that is inclined from level 5 to level 39 and goes vertical up to roof level at a height of 209.1 metres.
The inclined or stepping tower has an angle of 13.8 degrees from the vertical and leans towards the vertical tower.
The towers are connected by steel outriggers at four points at levels 39 and 41.
Each tower is supported by external walls and internal core walls forming a three dimensional structured frame. These walls are in the range of 350-500 mm thick. Above the podium level, the external walls are transferred via transfer beams which are also supported by reinforced concrete columns and reinforced concrete walls at podium level.
The external frame of the vertical tower comprises of reinforced concrete spandrel beams and reinforced concrete columns supported by transfer beams at Level 5 of the podium. The external frame of the inclined tower is composed of diagrid members made of steel columns which are supported by transfer beams also at Level 5.
There was a lot of interest in the diagrid structure of the inclined tower, in how the two towers are connected together, how they work together and how they work independently, Eror said.
He said the interest shown by structural engineers in Sri Lanka mirrors the reaction the Altair building generates among those who see images of it around the world.
Every modern technique and idea seen in high rise buildings around the world has been applied here, he said, revealing that he has spent 50 per cent more time on Altair than on the most complicated building he has worked on to date.
In Dubai, I was told that if this building had been located in the Marina, it would have sold out in two days, Eror added.
His company Derby Design was established in 1977 in the United Kingdom, opened its Abu Dhabi office in 1980 and its office in Dubai in 2008.
It is an international consultancy providing multidisciplinary design and project management services to the property and construction sectors in the United Kingdom, Middle East and Asia.

Born original
She being an engineer, teacher, mathematician, violinist and above all a singer has chosen to remain a housewife attending to her daily chores at home as a mother of four. But 2016 is a special year for this busy housewife, as Charulatha Abeysekara Thewarathanthri emerged as the Gratiaen winner for her work, Stories. Beloved wife of Bingu, mother of Dinindu, Amandi, Nethmi and Adithya, daughter of the late artiste Dr Tissa Abeysekara and Pushpa Meewella, Charulatha was educated at Visakha Vidyalaya and the University of Moratuwa.
Q: Why do you confine yourself to home
A: I had two of my four children while I was still at the University. I didnt have the heart to leave them to a nanny to pursue a career.
Q: What inspired you to be a writer
A: I have always written poetry since childhood, inspired by my author parents. But I began fiction to deal with the shock of my father passing away. I was used to having long conversations with him about everything. I badly miss those talks with him. I began to put my thoughts on paper. That was the start of a book.
Q: What is your employment record
A: After my A/Ls, we had a two-year wait until University entry, and I was employed for about a year at a fledgling bank (that sadly never opened) called National Enterprise Bank. That was my first job. After obtaining my degree, I became a mathematics/physics teacher, first at British School in Colombo and then S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia. Now Im at home doing the most fulfilling job of all  being a mom and wife!
Q: The award cannot be an overnight achievement. What do you think moulded your creativity
A: During my school days, I wrote poetry and short stories, which my friends and parents enjoyed. These were never published anywhere, and Ive lost nearly all of them. The little verses I wrote to my boyfriend (my husband now) are all safely filed away in a box-file by him. Now when I read them, I feel really embarrassed!
Q: And the birth of Stories
A: I am thankful to Lalitha Somathilaka and Siri Almeida for insisting that I submit my first book for the Gratiaen award. I was encouraged as a writer when that book got shortlisted.
My first book Autumn Leaves was shortlisted for the Gratiaen Award in 2011.
Q: How did you fare at the school
A: I was a member of the school choir and we won the All Island Singing Competition three years in a row  1987, 1988 and 1989. Other than that, I used to get the Applied Mathematics prize every time, and for my A/L results in 1994, I got the prize for Best results  Mathematics section and also co-won the Clara Motwani Shield for Applied Mathematics with a classmate.
Q: How did you come across the theme of your book
A: This book was written in Mauritius, which is as beautiful as Sri Lanka, but in a different way. It made me think of the environment of my childhood, of the times I spent in my aunts walauwa in Pattiyagodella, Amithirigala, Ruwanwella. Nearly all school holidays were spent in that estate, watching the birds, wandering in the woods amidst sounds of animals. The setting for the story comes from those memories.
I was assisted by my friends and husband in many ways. Their comments and criticism as well as praise were invaluable in developing the plot.
After the book won the award, the panel, consisting of Prof Sasanka Perera, Chandana Disanayaka and Ruhanie Perera, made a valid point. A book written in English should not be limited to this island. And their insightful remarks about fleshing out the story for the benefit of the international reader were invaluable in polishing and perfecting the manuscript.
Q: What are the preparations underway for that mission
A: It was quite a lot of work. To make a foreign reader grasp the depth and flow of the story, certain background information (relevant, of course) had to be provided, within the context. This is the sort of information we take for granted when writing for local readership.
For instance I mention Ratnapura in the story. A foreigner will not know what sort of a place it is or its significance to the storyline. So I had to say Ratnapura, the City of Gems, is, in many ways, a meeting place, a gateway or a link between worlds. It lies at the foot of the sacred mountain Adams Peak, bordering the virgin rainforest Sinharaja, some hundred kilometres from Colombo. It is the rendezvous point of the central hills and the southern plains. Adams Peak, also called Sri Paada kanda sacred footprint mountain - carries a footprint sunk into rock; a footprint believed, in turn, to be that of Buddha, god Shiv, Adam and St. Thomas by the four major religions. The peak, believed to be the point where Heaven is most easily accessible from Earth, is called Svargarohanam the stairway to Heaven - in Sanskrit.
I had to explain why a local boy would have a certain way of speaking his funny mixed-English speech when he was excited. Being born to educated and cultured parents, growing up in Colombo suburbs with shows like Knight Rider and MacGyver on TV, and associating with friends from different ethnic backgrounds, his speech was a rich mixture of British, American and Ceylonese English.
Im very grateful to my family for creating the space for me to do this and have the manuscript ready for publishing. My daughter did a painting for the cover. H D Premasiri and everyone at Sarasavi Publications has been very kind and helpful to me. The book will be published in August.

FOR A BREATHING SPACE
It is quite evident that Sri Lanka in particular and the rest of the world in general is passing through a supreme period of enjoying human rights in the annals of the recent history. We have good reasons to be proud of our human rights index because during the last bleak years we experienced bizarre violations of human safety due to many an intractable problems in the system fathered by ourselves using our own franchise under the misgivings of the so called intellectuals and political bogeymens coming.
Currently, it seems that the situation is ripe for us to discuss the status quo without fear or favour on behalf of the underprivileged lot or the underdog most frequently referred to by our red brigade leaders of the proletariat.
In discussing such matters, my mind spontaneously reverses to my own experience in 1971 in which year for the first time our paradise island raised war against the Queen in faraway England. The rest is history. It is said that history does not repeat in the same way. Lets be optimistic.
Intelligentsia
The insurgency in 1971 created a very chaotic situation in the country and stirred the deep slumber of the politicians and the intelligentsia who had taken the people for a ride since gaining the nominal independence to realize their lofty dreams. My concern here is to say that I was embroiled in this saga and was finally greatly benefited. The maiden socialist revolution of the country started on April 5 and the whole country came to a virtual standstill. I was fortunate to survive to tell the tall tale to you because of my common sense.
Even keeping the map of the country for school work was a punishable offence to be meted out with shooting. History is history even though many a leader tempted to define the situation for their own advantage. This was the year in which the writer had to sit for his G.C.E.[ADVANCED LEVEL] examination. All of us of the year had to be glued to the wireless to know about our fate regarding the examination and very poignantly some of our colleagues had to embrace death without any excuse for listening to the wireless, the only means of communication of the period.
During that time the G.C.E [A/L] examination was held in April. Under prevalent situation, the examination was put off to be held in August.
I had a ghost of a chance, I took up the cudgels with renewed interest to pass the exam to secure my seat at the university. I left no stone unturned to come off with flying colours and I did succeed. Not only that when I was selected to the university I had the good fortune to enjoy another luck by chance.
The university aspirants were given an opportunity to enter the university for their academic year after five years. In any academic year one could seek admission. As I was a poor young man I had to shoulder some responsibility to help my parents to keep the home fires burning.
This little prodigy exploited all the benefits to the fullest and saw the light at the end of the tunnel. Ever since my poor parents didnt want to sing for their supper and family happiness gathered momentum. I thanked the relevant authorities for giving me the breathing space to achieve my target in life.
Forgive me for digressing your attention to some of the past events in my life, yet I believe it would be useful to someone like me, and based on these authentic experiences I earnestly plead mercy for a breathing space for the innocent children of the flood stricken ares who are undergoing a similar ordeal that I faced during that juncture.
Flood stricken
The then relevant authorities were sympathetic enough to take the matters in the real spirit and did the needful. In this more awakened period of our history, I hope that the present leaders would be more empathetic , not sympathetic towards the children who are burning their midnight oil with a view to seek upward mobility through education. My plea would surely not stir the peace of the parents and the children of the areas where they were not affected by the flood havoc. So, they would feel it. Yet, the situation of the children whose houses were submerged to the rooftops and had to sleep on the tiles and the asbestos, some on the bare macadamized roads and even spending night after night on treetops with the fear of snakes coming to them is a tall tale to tell and talk. The whole country is looking forward to a reasonable remedy, not that of a cabinet reshuffle.
Time and tide wait for no man. This is the time to act. The rulers of a country could go an extra mile in these matters, yet some bureaucrats would not heed such reasonable solutions thinking that their offspring in comfortable schools would stir their mind and fail the examination. The whole red tape would prevent taking timely decisions and we should not repent later for not doing the needful in the nick of time.
Even at the time of this article is being written, the great lady in England is trying to buy breathing space to form a hung parliament.
The newly appointed ministers may be enjoying a breathing space to convert themselves to unfamiliar portfolios to begin work after the assumption of duties. A breathing space is commonly offered to the needy in other countries depending on the prevalent situations. Even in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY by JANE AUSTEN Elinor allowed a breathing space to her sister Marrianse after WILLOUBY affair. If our authorities are full of sense and their hearts become a bit more sensible , I hope the students in the flood stricken areas would be able to sigh a sense of relief in due course. Let them be sanguine.
HOPE FOR THE BEST, PREPARE FOR THE BEST
Thus reads the brief note written in my autograph by the emeritus professor Dr Tennyson Perera on the swans song of my four year university student career.

The Britexit will see more multinational companies based in Britain moving away to other EU countries and Germany will be the biggest beneficiary, said Senior Trade Felicitation Advisor International Trade Centre based in Geneva, Dr. Mohammed Saeed.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said most of the global based multinational companies headquarters and administrative officers are based in London as they considered is a central point to reach out to all European Union countries.
However with Britain moving out of the EU these companies feel that they could achieve better results if they shift to a country within the EU.
Asked why France neighboring Britain is not their first choice he said it was because of the tough language other policies of France.
In contrast Germany is very flexible and this will result in many multinational companies administration moving out of London to Germany.

Building the case for aggressive investment in SLs real estate sector
Having gathered extensive expertise designing and executing internationally renowned real estate projects across Asia and the Middle East, we have learned through experience that the truth on the ground can often get distorted when viewed through the kaleidoscopic lenses of political, economic and social commentary that often surrounds a market in transition.
In order to stay grounded and objective about any investment opportunity, it is therefore vital to first get the rubber to the road and take in firsthand developments past and ongoing, in order to understand the potential of what is to come.
Particularly to the well-travelled eye, a drive around the city reveals much about its character, its people, and its ability to drive progress.
Colombo is a truly one of South Asias most unique cites and we remain confident that this vibrant metropolis will continue to thrive and prosper, particularly over the medium to long term.
All across the city and its bustling suburbs, the signs of growth are abundant for all to see and while there are some considerable challenges to growth particularly when analyzed on a month-on-month, quarter-on-quarter or even on an annual basis. However, if we expand our frame of reference, there is an underlying momentum to Sri Lankas development that can no longer be denied and any prudent investor would do well to consider the fundamental strengths and attractions that Sri Lanka holds as a place to visit and explore, to transact, invest and do business, and as a beautiful and safe place to call home.
On the global stage, Sri Lankas international profile is one the rise. The unprecedented boom in the tourist sector is in many ways a short-term indicator of the countrys long term potential.
At present, Sri Lanka is ranked number 110 on the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Rankings. However, in several crucial areas the country had made or maintained progress most notably, in terms of how easy it is to start up a business.
Such improvements are timely when considering that Sri Lanka is increasingly being perceived as an island of opportunity, with an increasingly large footprint of multinational companies that rose from 275 to 301 between 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, Colombo office markets, which comprises nearly 1 million square feet of Grade A stock are in increasingly higher demand with average occupancy rates as high as 95%.
Such density of occupation only highlights the massive pent up demand that is building in Sri Lanka and this is due in no small part to the fact that new business opportunities are opening up and many of them will open up unprecedented new paradigms of social and economic development.
Already, we see notable upward trends in GDP growth, which stood at 4.4% at the end of 2016, but is projected to edge up to 5% in 2017 while per capita income stands at US$ 3,900, another clear indicator of rising prosperity.
As more opportunities open up for better jobs in Colombo, conditions in the city will become more congested. With the average commute for an office goer in Colombo already rising to over 1.5 hours during peak hours, it is clear that a change is required.
Across large cities in India, like Mumbai, a significant percentage of the population that works in the city does not live inside it.
Colombo has the opportunity to mitigate that situation by actively seeking to develop housing options for professionals and working people.
By minimizing the distance that they have to travel, Colombo can facilitate a more optimized configuration for further development, in line with the extensive plans of the Government to develop a Colombo Megapolis Project, Port City Project, and Colombo International Financial City. All of these developments will necessitate a transition towards affordable, high-quality vertical living.
However, at present there is already a serious shortage of good quality housing the city, particularly within the Rs. 20-35 million range.
Colombo has one of the lowest urban densities and most difficult commuting challenges of any major south Asian city. Thus, Colombo has no option but to go vertical in order to address these and catch up with the rest of South Asia.
In that context, housing also remains the best and safest investment for surplus wealth within Sri Lanka, with maximum potential for growth in suburbs like Rajagiriya.
Particularly as a result of revisions to Government policy over the past year, including the removal of tax concessions for real estate development, newer entrants into the apartment development industry will find it difficult to compete with established players who were able to open properties in the recent past.
In that regard, we anticipate an impending contraction in supply and an increase in demand, meaning that the markets best window for investment into the real estate sector would be over the next three-year horizon.

The Cabinet yesterday approved to amend the Judicature Act to accept the administrative district as the judicial area of a Justice of Peace whose appointments have been made to a judicial division, Justice and Buddhasasana Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said.
The Minister explained that some of the Justices of Peace have been appointed to a Judicial division, which is generally smaller than an administrative district. He said issues were created when new judicial divisions were formed by dividing the existing ones.
He was speaking at a function yesterday to award appointments of Justice of Peace (JP) to 350 persons at the Buddhasasana Ministry. He said he presented a Cabinet paper yesterday for amending the Judicature Act and the same was approved by the Cabinet. "Those who had been appointed already as JPs for a Judicial Division would automatically be appointed as JPs in the administrative district they are living in after the Act is amended in Parliament in near future," he said. The Minister's Coordinating Secretary and National Youth Council Director Dasun Nagashena addressing the gathering said that the persons rendering a commendable service to society were appointed as the Justices of Peace. He said they could play a pivotal role in society as mediators to bring about peace and harmony in society.

Can international litigation solve the India-Sri Lanka fishing dispute
This week, Sri Lanka adopted an amendment to its Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Act banning bottom-trawling fishing in its waters. Those in violation of the new law will face a significant fine and the possibility of two years in prison. It is an important move for Sri Lanka in addressing Indian fishing in the Palk Strait.
The Palk Strait lies between the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and the Northern Province of Sri Lanka.
It was recently estimated that 1,000 Indian fishing trawlers are taking 200,000 kilograms of fish in a day from the Sri Lankan side of the boundary. Both the ongoing depletion of fish stocks as well as Indian fishers continued use of bottom trawler fishing vessels in Sri Lankan waters have been a source of high tension between India and Sri Lanka.
The adoption of this amendment is an important step forward for Sri Lanka, as it ensures that the island state has the proper legal framework in place to take action to protect its resources and its marine environment. It also sends a strong signal to its own fishers and to India that it wants this practice stopped now.
The critical questions that follow are whether Indian fishers will heed the ban and how zealous Sri Lanka will be in the enforcement of its new law.
India has thus far urged restraint by Sri Lanka. Such a policy would make sense as the central Indian government seeks to ensure good relationships with state governments. This approach is critical in relation to Tamil Nadu where many of the fishers are also involved in state politics.
But how restrained does Sri Lanka need to be Acting sooner rather than later may be preferable to ensure the long-term sustainability of the fish stocks and the preservation of the marine environment. Continued progress on this issue is essential to respond to the needs of the impoverished Tamils living in northern Sri Lanka.
Depending on how law enforcement efforts proceed, one further option for Sri Lanka to consider is litigation under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. Both India and Sri Lanka are parties to this treaty. As parties, each has consented to the possibility of disputes concerning the interpretation and application of the UN Convention being referred to international arbitration.
Sri Lanka could readily claim that India has failed to act with sufficient diligence in preventing illegal fishing in Sri Lankas waters. It will be a question of fact as to whether India can demonstrate that it has done enough. Indias response to Sri Lankas bottom-trawling ban will become a vital part of this assessment.
Dispute settlement under the UN Convention has already addressed these sorts of questions. In an Advisory Opinion for the Sub-Regional Fisheries Commission, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea noted that states are to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance with fishing laws.
States are also to take measures to prevent illegal fishing by those vessels flying its flag. In the South China Sea arbitration, a tribunal found that China was aware of, tolerated, and failed to exercise due diligence over Chinese flagged vessels in violation of the Philippines fishing rights.
Sri Lanka could also argue that allowing the continued practice of bottom trawling is a violation of Indias obligations to protect and preserve the marine environment. It is well recognized under the UN Convention that the conservation of marine living resources is an element in the protection and preservation of the marine environment. In the South China Sea arbitration, Chinas failure to prevent its fishers from engaging in harvesting in a manner that was severely destructive of the ecosystem, in this context the use of dynamite and propeller chopping, violated the UN Convention.
In instituting proceedings, Sri Lanka would also have the possibility of seeking provisional measures pending the resolution of the dispute. Provisional measures might allow for an order that India take all steps immediately to prevent bottom trawling by its nationals in the Palk Strait so as to prevent on an urgent basis serious harm to the marine environment.
While this legal option is clearly open to Sri Lanka, is it politically feasible One of the notable features about litigation under the UN Convention of late is that smaller states have been taking on larger states as a way of asserting their rights in a way that has not proven successful in other forums.
Such was the situation for the Philippines against China, Mauritius against the United Kingdom, and even the Netherlands against Russia. Sri Lanka can note that Bangladesh has previously pursued this option against India.
Sri Lanka would of course be sensitive to the political relationship between the central government in India and the state government in Tamil Nadu. Yet one advantage of international litigation is that the judgment may provide a government with a new basis to act.
The central government might find itself with more leverage over the state government if it has to take prompt action because it must show its commitment to the rule of international law in complying with a possible award against it.
Such a show of commitment for India would be appropriate following the recent election of Neeru Chadha to the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Moreover, India has previously shown its support of the rules-based system established under the UN Convention in resolving other maritime disputes.
For example, India could have blocked Bangladesh in its efforts to resolve their maritime boundary dispute through litigation under the UN Convention. However, India was prepared to settle this long-standing dispute with its less-powerful neighbour through arbitration under the UN Convention.
India also has experience as a respondent to a case under the UN Convention with Italys challenges to Indias exercise of jurisdiction over two of its marines on the MV Enrica Lexie.
In light of this experience, a Sri Lankan effort to utilize international litigation may not be an excessive diplomatic affront to India. As a smaller state forging a new foreign policy post-civil war, Sri Lanka can and should show its commitment to the rules-based international system.
While international litigation may be perceived as a hostile move between countries, it actually takes a major bilateral issue off the table and allows discussion on other important topics between the parties while the case runs its course. This was an important advantage for Australian diplomats in their dealings with Japan once litigation over Japans whaling activities began.
Taking on this fight against its neighbour may prove too daunting for Sri Lanka. For the moment, the enforcement of its new trawler ban will be a priority. However, going forward its negotiating position with India should at least be strengthened in the knowledge that there is an international legal system at its disposal to support Sri Lanka in stopping damaging fishing practices in its part of the Palk Strait.

Chandimal inspires team on debut as captain
Sri Lankas new Test captain Dinesh Chandimal said that his team badly needed the win against Zimbabwe ahead of the tough series against India that starts later this month.
What we wanted was this win. Today we got that. The players mental state is in a good place. The Indian series is a big challenge. But we have plans, and well keep making plans, as to how to play against India, said Chandimal after leading his team to a four wicket win in his first Test as captain.
My biggest goal is the mentality to win every match. We need to have a good attitude to go from match to match. I gave responsibilities to all the players  whether they were juniors or seniors. Everyone can have good ideas. Even at team meetings, we gave them the room to talk.
We have a good start now. We saw the character of the team  how they picked themselves up. We have that mentality to achieve victory even when things look grim. My main goal is to win every game, he said.
Before the start of the run chase in the fourth innings Chandimal said the team got together and had a chat.
Most of what we talked about was playing your own game as batsmen. We knew that it was tough for us to bat out the time and draw the match. If we tried that, it was likely wed lose. So we said: play your own game, said Chandimal.
As a captain I told them that Id take the responsibility for any mistakes, so dont be afraid to make mistakes. Kusal Mendis, Dimuth (Karunaratne) and Upul (Tharanga) played well then at the end, Asela and Dickwella were excellent, he said.
On the morning of the final day Chandimal said that he had spoken to Asela Gunaratne who was handicapped by a hamstring injury and told him that he was going to get a hundred yesterday.
But very confidently, Asela said to me: No Chandi, there wont be a reason for me to get a 100. Ill get 70 and win the game. Thats the kind of faith I expect from my players. Theres a chance he might not have been able to do that today, but the way he spoke, even I became confident as a captain that we could win this match. Those are good things. Im really happy I have players like that, said Chandimal.
Chandimal gave credit to Zimbabwe the way they stretched his team in the Test.
Zimbabwes cricket has improved. Their batting is in a really good place. Also they had come with a good plan for this tour  that was really clear, said Chandimal. Even a bowler like Rangana Herath, who was bowling well at the time, they were not afraid to sweep and reverse sweep him. When that happens, it becomes very difficult for a bowler to put the ball in one spot. That is the biggest issue. But we also know who Rangana Herath is  hes our hero. He took the wickets for us  as did Dilruwan. Even though Zimbabwe was being aggressive, they still got the wickets, even without Asela. Im thankful to them both.
Man of the match Gunaratne commenting on his injury stated that it was not a big one.
I felt that my hamstring was tight. The physio also said it hasnt torn. But I was ready to bat. I had it plastered, and didnt bowl any overs or field. My inability to bowl was a big loss. My one goal was to rest and somehow take the team to victory, said Gunaratne who put on a century stand with Dickwella to swing the Test Sri Lankas way after they had lost the two overnight batsmen early in the morning.
Since he came to the crease, what Dickwella said was: Talk to me all the time, and make me score runs. I think what he meant was that he hasnt scored a big Test innings, whereas I have. He just wanted me to tell him how to handle situations. Sometimes when the game was going a certain way, he wanted me to keep advising him. Occasionally Id tell him not to go for certain shots. In the end, he stuck around and scored, said Gunaratne.

Chavakachcheri Magistrate commended for unbiased verdict
Founder of the Shanthi Foundation, Ven. Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera said yesterday, that the verdict given by the Chavakachcheri Magistrate S. Chandraratnam in connection with the building of a Stupa at the Navatkuliya Sri Samiddhi Sumana Viharaya in Jaffna is a boost for
religious freedom, religious unity and also the protection of the Constitution.
Ven. Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday said this verdict will lead to coexistence and communal harmony between Sinhala and Tamil people.
"We have great respect for her verdict which will further preserve the foremost place for Buddhism, according to the Constitution, The Thera said. "Even though, she is not a Buddhist, the way she respected Buddhism is a great example to everyone. These exemplary acts should be followed by many extremist politicians such as C. V. Vigneswaran, Vijayakala Maheswaran and TNA members in the North. Then, there will be no conflicts and misunderstandings among communities."
National Intellectual Sangha Council, Convenor Ven. Sooriyawewa Sumedha Thera said there are over 57 Buddhist families living in the Navatkuliya village and the temple was constructed as a place of worship for the residents. There was a request from the residents for the constriction of the new stupa for the temple and the construction work began.
However, the Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha impeded the construction work on the stupa by rejecting to grant permission for further work. The Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha filed the case against the construction of the Chaithya which was taken up for hearing at the Chavakachcheri Magistrate's Court. The Chavakachcheri Magistrate S. Chandrasekeran ordered the Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha to permit the construction of the temple's stupa without any hindrance. The Magistrate has said that she respects Buddhism even though she is a Hindu devotee. The North is the stronghold of separatist Tamil extremists and they are spreading extremism to win the Tamil people.
Hence, this verdict given by a Tamil Magistrate would defiantly a big drawback to the violent Tamil extremism prevailing in the North.

Importance of the new Taxation Bill
A new Taxation Bill will be presented to the Parliament within next two months. State Minister Eran Wickremaratne mentioned that action would be taken to reduce and completely abolish several taxes gradually over a period of time. Everybody will remember that in 1977 also the same undertaking was given, but no action took place in this regard in the past 40 years.
Whether the New Taxation Bill would be passed before end of September 2017 is not certain.
In the meantime the next Budget Proposals will be announced in November 2017 which may contain certain changes which may not be implemented in proper time frame, as experienced in the past two years.
Investment Planning and Tax Planning which are very important for development cannot be successfully made unless taxation policy is maintained in a uniform manner. Uncertainty and frequent changes would result, in frustration and investor resistance.
Hope the Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Professionals, Trade Chambers would advise Government on proper and timely implementation of the laws.

## Title: To come across Eliot
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

To come across Eliot
As far back as the first decade of the sixties, our English lecturer requested to know what T S Eliot (1888  1965) declared about the status of literature, culture and criticism. All of us had to purchase a book full of his ideas titled as Selected Prose as edited by a scholar named John Hayward.
The edition that is left with me at the moment is moth-eaten, but still the material comes closer to me as it happened in the past. As an undergraduate I came to know more about Thomas Stearns Eliot via the book full of short essays, both illuminating and resourceful. The most significant statement of Eliot went as follows:
From time to time, every hundred years or so, it is desirable that some critic shall appear to review the past of our literature and set the poets and the poems in a new order
Distant perspective
Then the critic Eliot goes on to expand the ideas further stating that this task is not one of the revolutions but of a readjustment. What we observe partly is the same scene but in a different and more distant perspective. There are new and strange objects in the foreground to be drawn accurately in proportion to the more familiar ones which now approach the horizon, where all but the most eminent become invisible to the naked eye.
These statements appear in the essay of Eliot titled as The Function of Criticism, which, if I remember right, became one of the most profound and lasting visions. For us it was a matter of reading several times in order to grasp the inner meanings of Eliot. His brevity in the use of language happened to be the hallmark in his approach to literary views. In the essay titled Criticism, he laid down that criticism must always profess an end in view, which roughly speaking, appears to be the elucidation of works of art and the correction of taste.
What then is the function of the critic
Eliot declares that the Critics task appears to be quite clearly cut out for him, and it ought to be comparatively easy to decide whether he performs it satisfactorily, and, in general what kinds of criticism are useful and what are unwanted and erroneous. Is literary criticism an aesthetic judgement It happened to be one of the foremost questions raised by Eliot. He was positive about it in many of his writings.
Habitual actions
For instance, he declared that comparison and analysis are the chief tools of the critic  why did he say, happened to be the question raised by most of us. Eliot responds to the question as it is obvious indeed that they are tools to be handled with care, and not employed in an imagery into the number of times, giraffes mentioned in the English novel.
On reading the essay titled Tradition, for a moment I felt as if I am reading the Buddhas Kalama Sutta. For Eliot states that tradition is not solely or even primarily the maintenance of certain dogmatic beliefs. These beliefs have come to take their living form in the course of a tradition. What Eliot means by tradition involves all those habitual actions, habits and customs from the most significant religious rite to our conventional way of greeting a stranger, which represent the blood kinship of the same people living in the same place.
T S Eliot is said to have studied most of the religious doctrines in the orient as well as in order to compose his poems like The Wasteland, where he makes the reader feel the emergence of a new world with the utterances of the man in the Rig Veda which goes as Ohm Shanti Shanti Shanti. One of the most sensitive questions raised by Eliot happened to be the need to transmit the validity of spiritualism to the modern world for the betterment of living conditions.
Eliots ideas on Religion, Culture and Society were initially laid down in the essay titled as The Idea of Christian Society and Notes towards the definition of culture.
Literary stream
Perhaps a reader of the essay may find that Eliot was more of a futurist or a prophet. The poetic plays of Eliot such as Murder in the Cathedral have placed him as the most spiritual and most influential poet of the century. He was born at St Louis, Missouri in the US and came to England to settle down and was engaged initially as a bank clerk. Staying for eight years in London, he entered the main literary stream as the editor of a literary journal Criterion.
This enabled him to joining the publishing firm Faber and Faber while working in the publishing firm, he had the grand opportunity of bringing out some of the best literary works such as Four Quartets, The Cocktail Party, The Confidential Clerk to name a few. In 1948, he was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature. Most of his poems, essays and plays have been translated and adopted to many languages.
The World Service of BBC, where I worked for a few years, once paid him a tribute by a series of discussions in the form of a live and creative dialogue with him, excerpting passages from his works. I feel that it is the function of the English teacher to reassess and or rediscover the great writer of the century.
Though Eliot became a British citizen in 1927 and has spent the greater part of his life in England. Some social critics believed that Eliot was an exponent of conservatism and tradition in literature, politics, and religion and his experience with the use of language and form in poetry. Some others believe that though the frame of his thought was conservative, the picture within the frame can be said to come closer to painters like Picasso and Dali.

Commercial Credit powers Future Minds 2017 
Commercial Credit continues to empower the Future Minds 2017 exhibition organised by the Nalanda College Junior Old Boys Association for the 12th consecutive year.
Aptly themed No One Left Behind, this national higher education and career exhibition is held annually in three main cities targeting a number of students who wish to pursue the global trend in achieving a higher education.
Future Minds had a hugely successful run at the BMICH Colombo from June 16 to 18 with the stalls and information centres being patronised by thousands of visitors.
Subsequently, the event drew large crowds, as it always does, to the Kandy KCC on June 24th and 25th.
Thereafter, it will be held at the Galle Town Hall from September 9th and 10th.
As the official sponsor we are proud to be associated with this national educational initiative for the past twelve years.
This mammoth venture is the portal to a secure tomorrow for our youth which is considered the backbone of our country. Future Minds has continued to guide the youngsters by providing numerous options to choose from.
Through Commercial Credit the many underprivileged students are further facilitated by a loan scheme which provides financial assistance to further their educational aspirations, said Commercial Credits Chief Operating Officer Rajiv Casie Chitty.
With this exhibition our aim is to provide a platform for students to achieve a world class education, with the intention of achieving their dream careers. These exhibitions are an invaluable platform for all those who are involved in the educational sector to communicate among each other. This further enables students to plan their future effectively. Higher education is a pre-requisite to securing a lucrative job in a competitive world and students are often mislead by the numerous advertising campaigns that lead to a cul-de-sac.
Future Minds, sets the benchmark for prospective students to ensure the validity and authenticity of the institutions and programmes available, said President of the Nalanda Junior OBA Chathura Lakindhu.The career counselling driven forum is channeled to pave the way for better understanding through extensive career counseling sessions and targeting students who have completed the AL and OL examinations. The students are initially subject to a psychometric test. Thereafter a number of industry experts, career and personal counsellors will be available for the students to get help in any aspect of career or personal guidance.
The exhibition is informative to families as a whole as it provides awareness of financing options and costs and provides more space for committing to a decision on the most effective higher education options for the student concerned.
Moreover, Future Minds grants youth the impetus to proceed in choosing a stream which would be beneficial for a future career on par with global trends while creating the most synergetic platform on higher education in 2017, which is the main aim of this exhibition.

Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera: Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake gives evidence in CA
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake gave evidence regarding a contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25 last year, yesterday.
When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, the first witness former Homagama Magistrate Ranaga Dissanayake informed that on January 25, 2016, Ven. Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
He began to address Court without obtaining any permission in a manner of obstructing court proceedings. He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept White Mans Law (suddage neethiya) and requested to release remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner of obstructing Court proceedings, but he continued to do so, the Magistrate said.
Gnanasara Thera began to intimidate Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, he said.
Meanwhile, Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate identified Gnasara Thera in the open court as the person who involved in the alleged offence at the Homagama Magistrates Court yesterday.
The evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnasara Thera.
The Court of Appeal proceeding has listed eight persons, including Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses.
Further inquiry into the matter fixed for today.
At a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution.
At a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
On January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. The Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
The Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

Scores are tabulated and cutoff points are established by the Head of Jury. Entries are shortlisted based on this score. A similar process is followed in round two. However, each juror may bring in pertinent observations to the table before scoring.
According to Fonseka, the jury goes through a very stringent procedure when picking a winning entry.

Court calls for comprehensive report
Misappropriating Rs. 12 million public funds:
The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered the CID to file a comprehensive investigation report in Courts on October 31 regarding former Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne and five others for allegedly misappropriating Rs.12 million of public funds allocated for the Negombo Lagoon Development Project.The Chief Magistrate made this order following a complaint by defence counsel alleging that the CID had failed to initiate a comprehensive investigation into the incident.
Six suspects including former Fisheries Deputy Minister Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, his son-in-law Upul Chaminda Kumarasinghe and four other officials at Ceylon Fisheries Harbour Corporation (CFHC) had been arrested by the CID for the alleged misappropriation of Rs. 12 million belonging to CFHC during the last Presidential election. They are currently out on bail.

Curious sensation
Dropping any story or narrative in your head about whats happening right now  what are the sensations youre feeling at this moment
What are you smelling, tasting, feeling, hearing, seeing What colors, textures, qualities of light can you perceive What does it feel like where your body makes contact with your clothing, with your chair, with the earth
This is your pure sensory experience, and it is rare that most of us let ourselves just stay in this place.
Usually, were caught up in a narrative about ourselves, our lives, our current situation, other people. We might notice the pure experience, but almost immediately we start judging it, wishing it were different, getting upset at it, or wishing it didnt have to change.
Now, theres nothing wrong with having thoughts about our experience  its natural. But it can be the cause of anxiety, fear, unhappiness, frustration.
Dropping into the mindfulness of pure experience is a way we can deal with those problems, in any moment.
Actually this is what meditation is, for the most part  dropping into pure experience. Many people misunderstand, and think, I shouldnt be thinking! Im screwing this up, because I keep having thoughts. This is not a problem. When you meditate, thoughts will come up. You will get lost in a train of thought.
What you want to do, in meditation, is get better at noticing when youre lost in a train of thought. Then, after noticing, simply return the the immediate sensations of your breath and the rest of your current experience. Its like waking up from a dream. Meditation is training to wake up more often, and stay awake longer.
Lets talk about dropping out of thought and into pure experience.
So what do I mean by pure experience Isnt everything part of our experience, including thoughts Yes, thats technically correct (the best kind of correct), but its useful to distinguish between our train of thoughts (what I like to call our story or narrative about our experience) and the actual sensations of whats happening right now.
A couple examples of the difference between the two: You feel coldness on your skin (sensation). You immediately think, This sucks, I dont like the cold, I need to get warmer. This is your narrative about the situation, your interpretation, your judgment. It makes you unhappy.
The pure experience of cold, without judgment or narrative, is just a sensation.Youre in an airport, and there are noises from people talking all around you, smells from the pretzel shop, light and colors and shapes and visual textures, and more. These are your sensory experience. Your story about how irritating the people are, or how you need to get a cinnamon pretzel in your belly right now, are your thoughts, judgments, narrative. The story can cause you to be unhappy with the situation, but the sensations are just sensations.
So right now, you can notice your sensory experience: What can you hear Take a moment to pay attention to all auditory sensations you are receiving.What light can you see What is its qualityWhat colors and shapes can you see Soak in the visual sensory information youre receiving.What touch sensations can you notice in your body right now Can you feel your feet, your butt on a chair, your jaw, your chest
What do you notice Can you be curious about these sensations, and stay with them

Despacito breaks global streaming record

Luis Fonsi's Despacito has become the most-streamed song of all time, just six months after it was released.
Thehit singlehas been played 4.6 billion times across all streaming services, overtaking Justin Bieber's Sorry, which previously held the title.
"What's happened with this song is just insane," said Fonsi, who hails from Puerto Rico and sings in Spanish.
"I don't want to use the word accident because I was trying to write a hit, but I didn't plan for it to cross over.
"I just wanted to make people dance."
The 39-year-old said the global success of his song - which has reached number one in 35 countries, including the UK - gave him hope in the current political climate.
"I come from Puerto Rico and I live in Miami. We're living in an interesting time right now when people want to divide us. They want to build walls.
"And for a song to bring people and cultures together, that's what makes me proud."
Despacito is a sun-bleached slice of sensual reggaeton. The title translates as "slowly", referring to the speed of Fonsi's seduction technique.
It hit number one around Latin America when it was released in January, but only caught fire in the English-speaking world after Justin Bieber heard the song in a nightclub and asked to add a verse.
His version of the song - known asDespacito (Remix)- has become a phenomenon on streaming services, most notably Spotify and Apple Music. It is already the fourth most-played video of all time on YouTube, where it is rapidly closing in on the top three, all of which are years old.
The head of Universal Music Group, Sir Lucian Grainge, said the success of Despacito showed how streaming was democratising the music market.
"Streaming has allowed a song with a different beat, from a different culture, in a different language, to become this juggernaut of success and pleasure," he told the BBC.
"The industry has predominantly been English-speaking artists for the last 50 years [but] streaming will continue to open up music from Latin America artists globally.
"Anything and everywhere is up for grabs."
Of course, records will continue to be broken alongside the growth of streaming services - which give users access to a vast library of on-demand music for a monthly fee.
In March, Spotify announced it had attracted 50 million subscribers. Apple Music, which is yet to reach its second birthday, has already attracted 27 million paying customers; while Google Play, Amazon Unlimited, Deezer and YouTube and dozens of others have contributed to Despacito's success.
Critics might point out that the song would never have achieved such visibility without Bieber's contribution, but Sir Lucian was candid about how Universal had harnessed the star's brand power.
"Bringing in Justin Bieber meant that we could take something that was well on its way, and really take it to heights that would have been perceived as unimaginable when the song was written," he told the BBC.
"We were at one level, and he helped us get to the next."
Fonsi also paid tribute to Bieber's contribution, and reflected on his breathtaking success in a phone interview from Lisbon.

Devapriya stresses need for womens cricket second string
Sri Lanka womens cricket coach Hemantha Devapriya stressed the need of forming a second string to feed the national womens squad and said that the recently concluded ICC Womens World Cup provided a good opportunity to weigh our teams ups and downs, so we can lay a strong foundation to produce a much better team in the future. He said so during a press briefing at the R. Premadasa Stadium attended by national womens team members and SLC officials.
Sri Lanka women captained by Inoka Ranaweera won a solitary match against Pakistan while losing the rest of six matches at the recently concluded ICC Womens World Cup to be ranked at seventh.
The team was selected for ICC Womens World Cup just after six months I assumed duty. The victory of the last match against Pakistan will be a great encouragement for teams future. We were unfortunate to concede victories to India and West Indies, otherwise would have ended at fifth place, he pointed out.
Devapriya also said that most of international womens cricketers maintained a higher strike rate, compared to Lankan women during the ICC Womens World Cup. Only Chamari Athapattu and Shashikala Siriwardena had a over 50% strike rate.
