Irreversible step of the First Council
Immediately after the Buddhas death a monk named Subaddha cried out that they dont need to worry about discipline any more. This Subaddha should not be misunderstood with the other monk who was ordained at the old age.
This was clear indication that there was some unrest in the monk order. The monk order had the royal patronage, and received warm welcome whenever they went on alms. Like today some people must have entered the monkhood for the sake of benefits and perks. The monks in the urbanity lived a luxurious life.
This luxurious life was much criticized among other sects of religion. Emperor Asokas brother Veethashoka was an ardent follower of Jainism, and did not have a good opinion about the Buddhas disciples. He always cited that the Buddhist monks had all royal luxuries.
Princely disinterest
This fell on emperors ears too. Asoka had a plan for his brother. While Veethasoka was dallying with his mates, the minister approached him and said that its time he should practice the kingship. Veethasoka was not interested. But the minister insisted that as the brother of the emperor he should be ready to take over in any case of emergency.
Veethasoka was forced to sit on the throne. Thats when the emperor approached and saw his brother on the throne. This led him to rage and ordered execution immediately. Veethasoka was helpless, and within a few moments the emperor said he would lessen the punishment.
He will be given seven days of kingship before the execution. During the period, he will be getting every benefit an emperor is entitled to. Veethasoka, though he had every power and things, was not happy even for a single moment within his seven days. Upon the completion, Asoka asked his brother if he enjoyed the royal perks. Veethasoka said he didnt enjoy it even a single moment, for the fear of death. Asoka then said there was no plan to behead him, but that was carried out to show that though monks live in royal luxuries they constantly have the fear of death. Thats no comfort then, the emperor said.
The discipline of Buddhism has been such. The Buddha always encouraged the middle path, though this itself is difficult to understand.
This kind of discipline did not appeal to some monks who ordained for benefits. The Buddha instructed that his teachings will be the teacher following his death.
Teachings assembled
The only way to preserve the Buddhism was to protect the teacher - the teachings, in this case. But teachings were not arranged into one place. The Buddha had taught on many occasions. That teaching had to be assembled. This is how first Dhamma convention starts.
Monk Ananda was only Sotapanna when the Buddha passed away. That became an issue when the first Dhamma convocation was to be held; it comprised only of arahants. When the scripts state monk Ananda became an arahant just the night before the convocation, it seems a little unbelievable. But it can be so, since the monk has already entered the path.
Even before the lapse of three months, the Buddhas teachings faced the threat of being shattered. Many attempted to infiltrate and misinterpret the teachings. The first Dhamma convocation had to come to pass on Nikini Poya, thought Arahant Maha Kassapa.
Subaddhas remark was the immediate thing that signaled a disaster  something really to mourn over. Many non-arahants including Ananda genuinely lamented.
The need for a convocation was bad, because the teachings were facing threats even during the Buddhas life. His cousin Devadatta caused ripples by trying to introduce new amendments. Arahant Maha Kassapa spent most of his life in the forest, mainly because he did not want to be mistaken as the Buddha: they had similar physical features except that the Buddha was four inches taller. Apparently as an arahant, he did not mourn the passing away, but was concerned about arrangements. He had to shoulder many responsibilities as he was the third chief disciple of the Buddha: the two chief disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana, had passed away before the Buddha. The convocation was his brainchild.
He must have been sure about monk Anandas capacity of achieving the arahantship, when he handpicked only 499 arahants for the convocation. The event occurred at the city of Rajagaha in Magadha state.
Monk Ananda
Monk Anandas role was significant not merely because he was the Buddhas chief attendant, but he had a powerful memory of the teachings. In addition, he enjoyed good intelligence and common sense.
The Buddha praised him when he delivered a sermon to King Mahanama eloquently. As the chief attendant, his service was unsurpassable. He nearly sacrificed his life to elephant Nalagiri, who came to attack the Buddha under the Dutch courage. This must have been sole reason  that he led an extremely busy life - monk Ananda could not concentrate on further mental developments.
He was struck by emotions, when he heard the Buddha was about to pass away.
He leaned against a column and wept silently. Consoling his chief attendant, the Buddha prophesied Ananda had done enough merits to become an arahant.
The convocation was in swing for three months. The Dhamma was classified into Sutta and Vinaya. The Sutta section contains Nikayas: Digha (lengthy), Majjhima (middle), Samyuktha (compact), Anguttara (sections) and Khuddaka (small).
Monks learnt them by heart, and they were known as bhanaka. Monks were divided according to the relevant section of the Dhamma.
Arahant Ananda and followers  Digha Nikaya
Arahant Sariputtas followers  Majjhima Nikaya
Arahant Ananda and his followers were entrusted with the responsibility for Digha Nikaya. The followers of Arahant Sariputta were entrusted with Majjhima Nikaya. Samyutta Nikaya was entrusted to Arahant Maha Kassapa and his followers.
Anguttara Nikaya was the responsibility of Arahant Anuruddha and his followers. All the arahants in general were made responsible for the Khuddaka Nikaya. Vinaya Pitaka was entrusted to Arahant Upali Thera.
This convocation was known as Pancha Sathika Sangikthi as it was held with the participation of 500 monks who had attained arahantship.

Kandy Esala Perahera as seen by Knox and Fa-Hien
As a predominantly Buddhist country, Sri Lanka is home to a number of colourful festivals and celebrations that mark the life and teachings of the great Buddha. Perhaps none are as spectacular as the Kandy Esala Perahera, a religious pageant that ranks as one of the best in Asia.
It is an annual event usually held in July or August on days fixed by the DiyawadanaNilame of the Dalada Maligawa.
Origin
Its origin, according to Mahavamsa, dates back to the 4th century AD. King KirthisiriMeghawanna was ruling the country based at Anuradhapura from 303 - 331 A.D. It was during his reign that the Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha was brought to Sri Lanka. The King placed the relic in a casket made of Phalika (Soapstone) and deposited in an edifice called the Dharma-Chakra built by King Devanampiyatissa in the third century B.C.
The Mahavamsa states that a great sum of money was spent in celebrating the festival in honour of the Sacred Tooth Relic. The King decreed that the Relic should be taken around the city of Anuradhapura once a year. There is evidence to show that his decree was faithfully carried out by those Kings who followed him.
Fa-Hien
Fa-Hien, one of the famous Chinese monks who arrived in Sri Lanka on a pilgrimage in the fifth century A.D. also gives a full description about the Perahera.
"By the side of the King's Palace is the Vihara of the Buddha's Tooth, several hundred feet high, brilliant with jewellers and ornamented with rare gems. Above the Vihara is placed an upright pole on which is fixed a great Padmaraja (ruby). The Tooth of the Buddha was always brought forth in the middle of the third month.
"Ten days beforehand, the King magnificently caparisons a great elephant, and commissions a man of eloquence and ability to clothe himself in royal apparel, and riding on the elephant, to sound a drum and proclaim as follows : Bodhisattva during three asankhyeyakalpas underwent every type of austerity; he spared himself no personal sufferings; he left his country, wife, and child; moreover he tore out his eyes to bestow them on another; he mangled his flesh to deliver a dove (from the hawk) ; he sacrificed his head in alms, he gave his body to a famishing tiger; he grudged not his marrow or brain.
Thus, he endured every sort of agony for the sake of all flesh. Moreover, when he became Buddha, he lived in the world forty years preaching and teaching and converting men. He gave rest to the wretched, he saved the lost. Having passed through countless births, he then entered Nirvana. After ten days the tooth of (this same) Buddha will be brought forth and taken to the Abhayagiri Vihara.
Let all ecclesiastical and lay persons within the kingdom, who wish to lay up a store of merit, prepare and smooth the roads; adorn the street, and highways; let them scatter every king of flower, and offer incense in religious reverence to the Relic.
Devale Perahera
It is doubtful whether the procession as described by Fa Hien continued to be held annually after Anuradhapura ceased to be the capital. However, it is clear that the Devale Peraheras that we have today in the Esala Perahera in Kandy did not form part of the Procession referred to by Fa Hein.
It is the belief of the historians that the Esala Perahera as we know it today, with the Hindu Devale Peraheras participating in it, had its origin in the mid-18th century during the reign of King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe. During the initial period of his reign, the Perahera was confined to the four Hindu Devales.
Robert Knox reports that even in the 17th century, the Perahera consisted only of the DevalePeraharas. He says, After all these comes an elephant with two Priests on his back: one whereof is the Priest carrying a painted stick on his shoulder, who represents neurDio (Aluth Nuwara Deiyo), that is the God and maker of Heaven and Earth. The other sits behind him, holding a round thing, like an umbrella, over his head, to keep off sun or rain.
UpaliMaha Thera
On 20th of July 1753 on the full moon day of UpaliMaha Thera and his retinue from Siam arrived in Kandy, to confer on the Sinhala monks the gift of the Upasampada, which had long disappeared from the island.
UpaliMaha Thera who witnessed the Perahera was quite disturbed that in the heart of a Buddhist country, the deities should be honoured in all pageantry and the Buddha ignored. It is said that as a result of the representation made by UpaliMaha Thera, the King ordered that henceforth "Gods and men should follow the Buddha", in the procession. This is how the sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha became the focus of the EsalaMaha Perahera.
The Kings decree had been faithfully carried out ever since.
Dalada Maligawa
The sacred Tooth Relic has been in various parts of the country. Ultimately King Vimaladharmasuriya the Second (1687 -1707 A.D.) brought the Relic from Labugama and deposited it in the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic (Dalada Maligawa) built by him in Kandy.
In later years King Sri WickremaRajasinha (1798 - 1815 A. D.) the last King of Kandy added the Octagon to the Dalada Maligawa. He was also the builder of the Kandy Lake.

Kohli ready to emulate Bradman in great India comeback
LONDON, Thursday - Only one team in the history of test cricket has won a five-match series from 2-0 down but India have an opportunity to emulate Don Bradmans Australians of 1936-37 after fighting back against England.
Just dont mention the outlandish idea to Indias coach Ravi Shastri. 1936-37 I wasnt even born, man! Why are you reminding me of 36-37, boomed Shastri in Nottingham on Wednesday after his sides emphatic victory had reduced their series deficit to 2-1 and prompted excitable questioning.
One match at a time, we live in the present, okay One game at a time. We move to Southampton and start afresh. Take a fresh guard. 2018, added the coach, in his finest dead bat mode of old.
The man who could bore for India with the bat has another cavalier side to him, though.
A guy who also once belted six sixes in an over  and in an era long before Twenty20 bashes  can keep the lid on the hype but Shastri knows his men must attack this once-in-a-lifetime chance with gusto.
His players were on a roll as Englands batsmen just rolled over at Trent Bridge. He purred at watching what he felt was by far the best Indian pace attack hed seen. And, above all, he trusted in his captain marvel Virat Kohli.
When the matchless Bradman, in his first series as Australias captain, went two down in those 1936-37 Ashes, he responded with a monumental 270 at Melbourne that set up their third test win.
Kohlis 200 runs at Trent Bridge  the second time in the series he had compiled a double century of runs in the match, following his defiant effort in a losing cause at Edgbaston  provided the same impetus for his side, continuing a series in which he has underlined his own greatness as a batsman.
So what happens next In Bradmans case, further epic captains innings  212 at Adelaide and 169 back in Melbourne  laid the foundations of the 3-2 comeback win. Yet while The Don was always in a world of his own, Kohli has his own Bradmanesque air at the moment.
His work ethic is second to none. I havent seen any cricketer  Ill put Tendulkar in that bracket  when it comes to preparation, in the way he visualises situations, the way he goes about planning what he plans to do, Shastri said.
I promise you, Virat will forget these two innings now and take guard
again as if he hadnt scored a run in the series.
GREAT TENDULKAR
Being ranked alongside the great Sachin Tendulkar would not so long ago have been considered almost unthinkable in India - now, though, it is accepted as a matter of routine.
Some good judges even believe Kohli is actually surpassing Indias little masters, Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar, now that he has conquered what they considered his last hurdle of thriving in English conditions. In one area, there can be no argument. Kohli paid tribute to Tendulkar after Indias 2011 World Cup win, saying: He has carried the burden of our nation on his shoulders for the past 21 years. So it is time that we carried him.
Now it is Kohli carrying the same burden and doing so beautifully. The Trent Bridge 200 took his tally for the series to 440, including two centuries, and returned him to the top of the ICC test rankings for batsmen.. With two tests left  the next starts at Southampton on Aug. 30  Kohli, who has scored more test runs (726) than anyone in 2018, needs six more to top 6,000 in tests and if he does so in the first innings, he will have reached the landmark in his 119th knock. Tendulkar took 120.
He could also go on to overhaul Rahul Dravids tally of 602 runs, the most by an Indian in a series in England.
Yet it is a measure of the way the 29-year-old has matured from tyro batsman into inspirational leader that the collective feat of India completing a cricket comeback for the ages would mean far more to him than more individual laurels.
We definitely believe we can if we play cricket like this, said the man who looks as if he could achieve anything if he keeps batting like this.

Nasser Hussain calls Virat Kohli the greatest player on the planet
The world is at a loss of adjectives to describe Indian batting legend Virat Kohli now. The Indian captain hit his second hundred in the third Test of the series against England on Day 3 at Trent Bridge that paved the way for Indias crushing 203 runs win. His 103 off 197 balls was also his 23rd in the format and he is now joint fourth with Virender Sehwag in the list of highest century-makers for India in the whites.
Kohli was showered with praise not just by fans and Indian former cricketers but also by former English captains as well. After Michael Vaughan asserted that he is the best player in the world, another former Three Lions captain Nasser Hussain called him as the greatest player on the planet.
Kohli might not feel he had a point to prove in England after his 2014 tour but world cricket was waiting to see if he could get runs here to cement himself as a great and be up there with Sachin Tendulkar and Sunil Gavaskar for India, Hussain wrote in his column for Sky Sports.
HE IS FAR FROM A FLAT-TRACK BULLY
Hussain was also of the opinion that Virat Kohli is not a flat-track bully and the way he has batted in the tough conditions in England has proved it. He has put any doubts well and truly to bed, with 400 runs in conditions that have been very bowler-friendly. He is far from a flat-track bully. Its been an outstanding performance from a great, great player.
I believe he is the greatest player on the planet right now. I like the balance he has between intensity and having a relaxed nature  he will talk to the umpires, talk to Anderson, Stokes and Jos Buttler but the moment he is on strike, boy, does he switch on, he further wrote.  ct

New motion to increase Auditor Generals salary
The Government will present a new motion to increase the salary and allowances of Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella told Parliament yesterday.
He made this clarification with reference to the Governments move on Thursday to withdraw a Determination under the Constitution pending in the Order Paper to raise the salary and allowances of Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe.
The minister said the new motion would raise the AGs salary and allowances to a level higher than what was proposed in the withdrawn motion.
Our effort is to give him more recognition by further increasing his salary, and the claims that we try to take revenge on him were not true, he explained.
He said the Government would revise the determination and present it again to Parliament in the near future. JVP MPs demanded a clarification from the Government on Thursday as to why it decided to withdraw the proposal relating to the salary and allowances of the AG. They pointed out the said proposal to raise the AGs salary has already been delayed for three years.

No show by Squash Federation a blow to the sport
The Sri Lankan Squash Federation has unilaterally decided not to send a team to Chennai for the Asian junior individual squash championship 2018 citing security concerns in the city.
Despite appeals by the parents of the children and giving indemnification of responsibilities the SLSF has stood negatively citing that the Indian Squash Federation were not providing the security and a letter by DGM sports not sanctioning the tour due to security concerns as the primary reasons for not touring Chennai. The parents are quoting the recent successful tour by the newly formed Sri Lanka Windsurfing Association that went to Chennai with Sport Ministry approval and had no issue and returned successfully. Sri Lanka has participated in all squash tournaments at Iran, Jordan and Malaysia and this will be the first no show in its history in the Asian junior individual squash championship 2018. It is learnt that the secretary of the Squash Federation is opposed to sending the kids to Chennai.
Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha has intervened on behalf of the parents and directed the SLF to send the team if the parents are willing to take the responsibility.
The parents are of the view that SLSF has strained relations with India and are in a non-communicating mode. On the Sports Ministers inquiry the Sri Lankan High Commission in India has cleared the team to visit citing there is no intelligence report of any planned disruptions and has promised assistance.
The deadline for the entry is 24 August which is today.
The SLSF has time till midnight tonight to enter the entries. But they have so far not had any trials or preparation notice giving indication that this is a planned moved not to send the team to India.
The selection of players for the Asian Games was also marred by controversy with initially only two players being nominated and another two being nominated in the eleventh hour.

Delimitation Committee Report on PC polls rejected
The Report of the Delimitation Committee for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils was rejected in Parliament yesterday with 139 votes against.
Accordingly, the Speakers Office announced that the five-member Review Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, would be appointed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya within the next few days with the agreement of all other parties. It stated that the other members of the committee would be experts in the field who are not politicians. The review committee is tasked to present its report within two months.
At the end of a full-day debate, the vote on the delimitation committee report was taken at 6 pm. A total of 85 members were absent, including the six JVP members. Notably, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and Opposition Leader R Sampanthan too were absent. Out of the 23 SLFP members in the Government ranks, only 3 Ministers namely Faiszer Musthapha, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Nimal Siripala de Silva were present when the vote was taken. They voted against.
The UNF, TNA and JO members voted against. Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, a minority party leader in the UNF, was absent. The Speaker at the end of the vote, announced that the report had failed to obtain the needed two thirds majority.
However, the House even at the end of a full-day debate, failed to come to an agreement as to whether the Provincial Council elections be held under the old system or the new system. The SLFP and the JVP advocated for having elections under the new system, while the UNF, TNA and JO were pushing for reverting to the old system.A new mixed electoral system with a 50:50 ratio for the First-Past-the-Post system and Proportional Representation system was introduced for the PCs last year. Objections to the new system grew following the Local Government Elections in February.
However, the two thirds majority was needed even if the House wishes to repeal the new electoral system in order to go back to the previous system.
The Delimitation Committee comprised of Kanagaratnam Thavalingam (Chairman), retired Surveyor General Dr. Anila Dias Bandaranaike, retired Assistant Governor of the Central Bank Professor S.H. Hisbullah, Prof. Sangara Wijeyasandiran and retired Assistant Election Commissioner Premathilaka Siriwardena presented the report to the Minister on February 19.
The Delimitation report was submitted to the House by Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha on March 6.
Elections for the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PCs are already due, while the term of another three PCs namely the Central, Northern and North Western PCs is due to end by September.
Party Leaders on July 20 agreed to schedule the PC elections on January 5, 2019, if Parliament could arrive at an agreement on matters relating to the elections before the end of October.
Hot air between Kiriella and Arjuna over SL-Singapore Free Trade agreement
Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and Arjuna Ranatunga contradicted each other in Parliament yesterday, when they spoke about obtaining Cabinet approval for Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga in response to a supplementary question by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena, said that he had not seen the FTA with Singapore yet. MP Gunawardena requested the minister to object to the liberalization of the petroleum sector under the agreement and protect the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation from privatization.
The minister replied that he was not aware of the agreements impact on the petroleum sector, but added that he would not let the CPC be privatized while he was the subject minister. He said so far there had been no proposal to privatize the CPC.
NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa at this point, queried as to why Minister Ranatunga did not study the FTA prior to approving it at the Cabinet. Does the ministers response mean that the agreement was signed keeping the other Cabinet members in the dark he asked.
At this point Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella stressed that the FTA with Singapore was presented, discussed and approved at the Cabinet.
Former Minister and SLFP Group of 16 MP S B Dissanayake said the Agreement did not receive Cabinet approval and what was agreed at the Cabinet was to re-present it after a thorough discussion with experts and other relevant groups.
Minister Rauf Hakeem intervening at this point, said it was wrong to claim the FTA was signed secretly, keeping the Cabinet and the House in the dark as discussions on it had been going on for years. The FTAs are not signed overnight. It is a long process, he noted.
Meanwhile, another argument erupted in the House as to whether the FTA needed to be approved with a two thirds majority in Parliament to give it legality. MPs Bandula Gunawardena and Dinesh Gunawardena argued that the Constitution required the FTA to be passed with a two thirds majority in Parliament.
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said that he sought the Attorney Generals legal opinion prior to signing the agreement and that he acted as per his advice. He asked the JO MPs to go before the Supreme Court if they had any doubt over the legality of the procedure taken.
UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri observed that the former Government did not present the Pakistan-Sri Lanka FTA in Parliament prior to signing.
Minister Faiszer Musthapha, quoting the relevant section of the Constitution, said what the Constitution says was that if an agreement obtained the sanction of two thirds, no written law could be published in contravention of the treaty, except in the interests of national security.
This is distinct from the position taken by MP Dinesh Gunawardena that every international law should be tabled in Parliament.
SLFP votes against Delimitation Committee Report:Minister Musthapha
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha told Parliament yesterday, that the SLFP had decided to vote against the Delimitation Committee report.
The announcement made towards the end of the debate came as a surprise to many in the chamber. The minister said the SLFP decided to vote against it, due to the loopholes in the report.
As the subject minister, I appointed an independent delimitation committee and I did not interfere in its affairs. My responsibility was to present its report to Parliament and Parliament has to either accept or reject it. I too have the right to either accept or reject the report, as I was not involved in its the making. I object due to the loopholes in the report, he noted.
The minister said the loopholes in the report could be amended during the appeal process once the Delimitation Appeals Review Committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is appointed.
The minister, opening the debate earlier on the day, pointed out that those who are against the new electoral system do so due selfish reasons. Such types of people and parties want to protect their bargaining power in national level politics. They want to join the main parties of the country by highlighting their ethnic communities, so they could make deals with such parties, he noted.
The minister still batting for the new electoral system said, Sri Lanka would not go forward if we continue to oppose progressive proposals such as the new electoral system. The minister expressed his strong opposition for reverting to the old electoral system.
Musthapha said that the preferential vote system had barred less affluent citizens from being elected to Parliament. So many lives were lost and properties damaged as a result of the nature of that system. It is a threat to democracy. We should change that situation for the betterment of this country, he added.
Sri Lankan politics should be converted to Public Service:JVP Leader
Politics in Sri Lanka which had presently turned into an extremely profitable business, should be re-positioned as a public service, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday said. He pointed out that an electoral system alone could not change this destructive political culture. Dissanayake pointed out that many who had an average lifestyles before being elected to Parliament, have later turned into wealthy businessmen.
Dissanayake further said that in the present political culture, politicians have become goods that are being sold for money. There is no point in having a good electoral system, if politics is corrupt in every possible manner, he said.
Dissanayake made these observations, joining the debate on the Delimitation report concerning the Provincial Council election held yesterday.
Dissanayake was extremely critical of the Government, the Joint Opposition and the ethnic based political parties for working together against the new electoral system. According to Dissanayake, all these parties main objective was to defeat the Delimitation report, so that they could postpone the Provincial Council election and a just electoral system. The government is unable to face the public. So they wish to skip this election. Minority parties want a change in the electoral system as the new system would not support their ethnicity based politics. These political leaders who represent the ethnic minorities, wish to do away with this mixed electoral system, as it does not support racism, he observed.
Do not ignite racial disharmony: Ganesan
National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan yesterday, requested Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa not to ignite racial disharmony using a recent conflict that occurred between two fishing communities. Ganesan requested the JO MP to let the government solve the matter without trying to make things worse.
Minister Ganesan also said that they would not permit anybody to create racial conflicts in the country once again.
President Maithripla Sirisena had already looked into the matter, while discussions are afoot to resolve the issue. So allow this problem to be solved properly, Minister Ganesan said.
Minister Ganesan made these observations when JO MP Wimal Weerawansa told the House that some Tamil fishermen at Mullaitive had attacked a group of Sinhalese fishermen from Chilaw, who do migrant fishing.
In reply to MP Weerawansas allegation, Minister Mano Ganesan said that he inquired about the matter from the District Secretary of the area. According to the DS, the two fishing communities had clashed when the migrant group has attacked the local community and burnt down some shelters built by them.
We have no problem in sharing the ocean. There is no Sinhala sea or Tamil sea. We have no problem with migrant fishermen either. But if some of them act in an illegal manner, it is not correct, Ganesan said. Minister Ganesan also said that they are completely against the Indian fishermen invading Sri Lankan waters and stealing Sri Lankas resources.
Multi-member constituencies must be formed: Hakeem
SLMC leader and City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauff Hakeem yesterday, said the minorities have suffered due to the delimitation report and urged the government to consider forming multi-member constituencies for the benefit of minor and minority parties for the forthcoming Provincial Council elections.
Minister Hakeem criticized the Delimitation Committee for taking decisions being limited to within statistical straight jackets which had no flexibility.
Participating in the debate on the Report of the Delimitation Committee for the Delimitation of Electorates in Provincial Councils, Minister Hakeem said the delimitation committee had done a great injustice to the Muslim community and other minority communities.
The delimitation committee have set themselves at some internal criteria, which in my opinion, is wrong and discriminatory for minorities. It does not reflect the necessary diversity in selection of members to Provincial Councils. When there is a particular minority community living in substantial numbers within a geographical space, they have to bring in a criterion to form constituencies benefitting the particular community, Minister Hakeem said. He observed that such an important postulate had been overlooked.
If the government fails to rectify the shortcomings of the report, we perhaps would be compelled to leave the government, the Minister further said. When the Joint Opposition members started commenting on the Ministers claim, Hakeem said, you dont need to prompt me to take political decisions. We are intelligent people. We know how opportunistic you could be. I am used to resigning. I have done it twice before. I might be the only minister in this government who has left his ministerial post due to disagreements and demands, he further said.
The Minister pointed out that there are issues relating to the creation of constituents in many areas where there is a Muslim representation, such as Udunuwara, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Mawanella and Gampaha.
I am sure the government would take up the amendments we have proposed or go for the old law to hold the elections soon. We must look for an alternative if we are to hold Provincial Elections in a timely fashion, he added.
Train fares lower than bus fares even after 40% hike: Transport Minister
Even after Railway fare revisions, train fares are 40% low-priced than bus fares, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday, pointed out.
He also pointed out that the last revision to train fares was in 2008.
Minister de Silva also said that as soon as Indian power sets are brought to the country, the ministry would facilitate a new night mail train to the North.
The Minister pointed out that Sri Lanka Transportation Board had recorded the highest income in the Northern Province.He made these observations in reply to EPDP leader Douglas Devanandas question in relation to the train fare revisions applied to fares from Palai and Kankesanthurai to other parts of the country and vice versa. Devananda pointed out that there was a 15% fare revision to the said train lines and questioned if the new 15% revision would also be applied to the same.
Minister de Silva pointed out that the said fare disparity would be addressed accordingly.
Draft amendment to hold PC polls under old system
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella presented a draft amendment to repeal the Provincial Councils Elections (Amendment) Act, No. 17 of 2017 and to hold the PC elections under the old electoral system.
The minister pointed out that if all parties agree with the draft amendment, the Government would be able to hold the PC elections soon. He was of the view that the PC elections would be delayed for about another year if the elections are to be held under the new system.
The minister in his draft amendment proposed to conduct the PC elections under the Provincial Councils Elections Act, No.2 of 1988.
The UNP has already discussed with the JO on bringing an amendment to the current law. I will pass this draft document to you. If we can agree on it we can make arrangements to hold the elections soon, he told MP Dinesh Gunawardena.
He pointed out that the UNP is for holding the Provincial Councils Elections under the old electoral system. It is the UNP which introduced the PC system in 1987. The UNP is of the view that our country needs power devolution as a solution to the national question and PCs are closely associated with power devolution mechanism. We too wants PC elections to be held soon, he said.

The President pointed out to the adverse effects experienced by us as a result of climate and environmental changes that the country faced during the past few years.
According to recent reports, Sri Lanka has reached the fourth place among the worlds worst affected countries,due to advesrse weather and climate changes, the President said.

Protection of the Pirith ensemble
A mental states are mind made. The mind is their chief. If, with a pure mind one speaks or acts, happiness follows him like the shadow that never leaves the owner (Dhammapada).
Paritta is a Pali term meaning protection that refers to various formulae which are recited for protection or blessing. This term also denotes the collection of such texts as well as the ritual at which the collection of these texts or parts of these are recited. This ritual performed by the followers of Theravada Buddhism, is a complex religious rite with individual formulae appropriate for specific circumstances such as ill health, natural calamity, or the blessing of a new house.
Monks chant the texts while holding a ritual string on their hands. This string is usually tied to various ritual implements, including a pot of water, before finally reaching the assembled people to whom the blessings of the chanting are transmitted. At the end of the ceremony, the ritually pure water is sprinkled and pieces of the thread are tied either around the neck or wrist for protection.
The chanting of pirith, so popular today is used to exorcise evil spirits and to protect a person or society from evil influences and pestilences. This practice is a pre-Buddhist practice adapted to Buddhism. It is a magical rite taken into Buddhist ritual. The mandapa or the canopy, the water-pot, the sacred thread and incense are paraphernalia of magical rites (Sinha, 1953). In Sri Lanka, Protective recitals are chanted by Buddhist monks and sometimes by lay people. Often their recitation is the most important script involved in an all-night religious ceremony.
Harmful influences
Protective recitals were promulgated by the Buddha. The Ratna Sutta was delivered by the Buddha to dispel a plague in the city of Vesali. The Khanda Paritta was taught as a protection against snakes. The Mora Paritta is a protection against enemies. The Dhajagga Paritta is an antidote to fear and terror. The Atanatiya Paritta that praises the virtues of the seven past Buddhas, is a protection against harmful influences. The Angulimala Paritta is a protection for pregnant mothers to ensure safe delivery.
In The Questions of King Milinda, there is an important dialogue between King Milinda and revered Nagasena about the value and the significance of protective recitals.
King Milinda asked, If one cannot escape death either in the sky or in the mid-ocean or in a mountain cleft or anywhere in the whole wide world, then protective recitals are useless.
Revered Nagasena responded The protective recitals are helpful for those who are of full age and who are free from an obstruction due to karma. No protective recital can prolong the life of one whose span of existence is coming to an end. Even if a thousand jars of water were poured to a dead and dried up a tree, it would not grow. A farmer guards the grain when it is ripe and ready for harvesting by preventing water from entering among the corn, but makes it grow by giving it water when the corn is young and full of life.
Enraged elephant
Revered Nagasena compares protective recitals to medicines that cure diseases. He further says that when a protective recital has been said, a snake ready to bite will not bite the club which robbers hold aloft to strike would never strike an enraged elephant rushing up would suddenly stop a great blazing fire would die outa deadly poison one had eaten would become an antidote or serves as food assassins would turn into slaves and a trap set to hold one would not hold him. However protective recitals would not be effective and protection due to karma because of an obstruction due to the defilements and due to lack of faith. Revered Nagasena stated that a naughty child would harm himself despite the mother's loving care.
Generally, a pirith ceremony is followed by an alms giving ceremony to the monks. It is believed that giving food, endows long life, beauty, happiness, and strength to the giver as well as to those who receive it. This merit has been explained by the Buddha to the Kolian lady, Suppavasa who served the Buddha with various kinds of delicious food. Suppavasa was said to have been foremost among those female lay disciples who used to offer choice alms-food to monks. She was the mother of the arahant Sivali.
Donations made to monks for example by providing food, clothes (robes) etc are believed to produce great merit. During the days of the Buddha there lived a wealthy financier called Anatha Pindika who constructed a monastery named Jetavanaramaya and donated to the Buddha. He was noted for giving alms on a lavish scale. It is said that he was reborn as a god after his death and later returned as the god to Jeetavanaramaya to praise arahant Sariuth in the presence of the Buddha (Ratnasiri, 2010). In Sri Lanka, pirith and almsgiving are traditional and conventional events organised on a very large scale during the Poya days such as the Vesak, Poson and Esala full moon days.
Chanting Pirith and Alms Giving are meritorious actions (punna kriya) performed with good intention (punya cetana). The good intention continues to exist during the preparatory stage (pubba cetana), during the performance stage (mundane cetana) and after the performance whenever thinking of it with joy (apart cetana). The merit increase whenever the performer remembers the meritorious act. So, some individuals make use of electronic technology (audio-visual recordings and digital photograph albums) for assisting memory retrieval. The Buddhists believe that meritorious deeds yield happiness in the present life and the life to come.
Decorative material
A pirith ceremony was planned, organised and implemented to bless a sick individual who was taking medical treatment for a kidney disease. A pirith canopy (mandapa) was erected by the local people using local young coconut leaves as decorative material. A new pot of pure water containing tender arecanut flowers was placed in it with a woven thread. On the first whole night a group of ten lay people chanted pirith and on the following morning pieces of the pirith thread were tied on the wrists of the gathering.
The pirith chanters were served breakfast, well looked after and given cash incentives in the end. On the following day, ten Buddhist monks arrived in a procession accompanied by the drum beaters. The Buddha's Relics Casket (Karaduva) was brought on the lead with great respect over the head of the sick person's son. The Buddhist monks were invited into the house of the sick person after their feet have been washed and cleaned. Then followed the usual practice of observing the precepts by the participants and repeating the Buddhist precepts after a monk. First of all the Buddha statue was offered alms in a symbolic manner (Buddha Puja). At half past eleven, the monks were served with lunch. The serving of lunch was an elaborate procedure starting with king coconut water followed by oil cakes, kokis, ripe plantains etc and the main meal of rice and curry.
Each monk was given an apple. Later salads were given followed again with king coconut water. Finally, betel was offered. After the meals, one senior monk read the agenda of the proceedings that followed. Then two very senior monks delivered two sermons blessing the sick person, the family members and the dead parents of the sick person. The merits of pirith and the alms offering were foregrounded in the sermons. Finally, the monks chanted pirith while the family members and the sick person poured water from a kettle to a cup that began to overflow amidst the pirith chanting. Ata Pirikara (robe, feeding bowl plus other utensils) was offered to the chief prelate, while other gifts were given to the other monks. Envelopes each enclosing a thousand rupee note was offered to each monk. The monk departed after the ceremony.
Digital photographs
They had to be provided transport and when they left they carried off the remaining food and sweets too. After their departure, the friends and the relations of the sick person enjoyed the lunch provided by the sick person's beloved wife. Later the digital photographs on various aspects of the pirith and the dane event showed to the gathering. The gathering comprised over fifty adults, excluding the children.
Someone was saying that it was very costly and cumbersome to organise and conduct a pirith and dance ritual, that a poor person could not afford to do. On the whole, this was a successful cultural event. With adequate community participation. Whoever came to participate in this even brought some donation in kind (Curd and treacle, fruits, milk foods and locally made sweet eatables etc).
Some participated in the activities pertaining to the event. In particular, the womenfolk who wore white clothes took part in the cooking and serving activities. However, it came to be known that there were two contractors who have to be paid for organising this activity. It transpired that the sick person had to pocket out around Rupees 200,000).

Railway unions to strike from Wednesday
Sri Lanka Railways trade unions have decided to launch an indefinite train strike from Wednesday August 29 midnight since discussions with relevant authorities failed to provide a viable solution to their grievances. Railway Trade Union Collective Co-Convenor Lal Ariyaratne said discussions held last Wednesday with President Maithripala Sirisena and government officials by trade union representatives including engine drivers, controllers, guards and station masters were unsuccessful.
Even though, we had earlier planned to launch the strike from Wednesday midnight, we did not do so as it would affect rail commuters visiting Kandy for the Dalada Perahera and students facing the Advanced level examination.
We decided to resume our trade union action from next Wednesday (29) midnight.

Root, Buttler sign up to Big Bash with Sydney Thunder
LONDON, Thursday - England's Test captain Joe Root and vice-captain Jos Buttler have agreed a deal to play for Sydney Thunder in the first half of the 2018-19 Big Bash League.
Both players will be available for seven games that fall between England's winter tours to Sri Lanka and the West Indies. Root went unsold in the lucrative Indian Premier League auction in January and has played just 12 T20 matches since England's defeat by West Indies in
the World T20 final in April 2016 due to a combination of his Test commitments and poor form.
By contrast, Buttler is one of most in demand players in the world in the short form of the game and is fresh from hitting his first Test century in England's third test defeat to India.
Buttler starred for the Rajasthan Royals in the IPL this year and returns to Sydney Thunder after scoring 202 runs in six innings during last year's Big Bash.  AFP

Sam Curran: the costliest drop by England
England team has dropped many catches during the series, the number is well past a dozen and we are just halfway through the series. But, their costliest drop has been Sam Curran. He was dropped from the third Test which proved to be a blunder.
He was instrumental in helping England win the first Test. His second innings half-century eventually proved to be the difference between the two sides. His partnerships with tail-enders gave England the sniff, which was turned into a golden opportunity by their pacers, which included Curran himself. His maturity really stood out as he was playing just the second test of his career. His contribution with bat over-shadowed his brilliant bowling performance. It was Curran who broke the first innings opening partnership between Vijay and Dhawan, which was looking ominous for England. In fact, Curran chipped in with a wicket, whenever a partnership was blossoming. He was the go-to man for Joe Root whenever he needed a wicket.
Also, Curran brought in much-needed variety in English attack with his left arm medium pace. Lack of variety in English attack has been on the forefront during the third Test, with their attack struggling for wickets. His inswinging deliveries would have been a real threat for the Indian side which is loaded with right-handed batsmen. Moreover, he seems to be a gritty and fiery character who loves to dig deep and put up a fight.
It is obvious that England made a mistake by dropping Curran. The eagerness to accommodate Stokes into the eleven could be the reason for this logic defying step. England who lost the third Test to have their lead cut down to 2-1 in the five-match series would need to get their selection right for the last two Tests, which would mean bringing Sam Curran into the eleven. But, who is dropped to fit him in the playing eleven, remains to be seen.  sk

Academy coaches should not be entertained Parents who do a lot for their children are worried because it is learnt that most of the school junior coaches are running rugby academies and only
their students are included in the school teams. Those who dont go to their academy are not considered. In the recent under 14 competition, an injured player from the schools was included in the squad because he was from the coachs academy. What schools should do is they must not employ coaches who run academies.

Shane Warne autobiography No Spin to be released in October
Spin legend Shane Warne will talk about his extraordinary cricketing career and his life off the pitch besides unveiling several unknown facts in his autobiography which will be published this October.
Ebury Press announced that Warnes memoir No Spin will have a global release on October 4.
No Spin is the true story behind the headlines, in Warnes own voice, and challenges some of the enduring myths and untruths that surround him.
Uncompromising and compelling, it is destined to rank alongside some of the greatest sports autobiographies ever, the publisher said.
Andrew Goodfellow, deputy publisher at Ebury, said, Despite all the pain hes inflicted on us over the years Shane Warne is still one of the most admired and celebrated cricketers to a British audience.
You simply cant imagine the game without his unique contributions. I think his insight, no-nonsense honesty and strength of voice will make this the most read cricketing autobiography in years. At Ebury we are all very excited and honoured to be publishing such a legend.
The memoir is written with cricketer and TV presenter Mark Nicholas.
Warnes mesmerising bowling prowess coupled with his personal life (which has long been fodder for the tabloid press) has made him one of the worlds most illustrious sportsmen. Born on September 13, 1969, Warne is widely regarded as one of the finest bowlers in the history of the game. He played his first Test match in 1992, and took over 1,000 international wickets (in Tests and One-Day Internationals).A useful lower-order batsman, Warne also scored over 3000 Test runs. He played domestic cricket for his home state of Victoria, and English domestic cricket for Hampshire. He also captained the Rajasthan Royals to victory in the IPL in 2008.
He officially retired from all formats in 2013 and currently commentates for Foxtel.  Scroll.in

Shedding crocodile tears for democracy
As explained by Lal Wijenaike, the 10 experts nominated by the Steering Committee and drawn from various professions like engineering, legal, political and academia, with different backgrounds worked on an initial draft, based on interim report and 6 subcommittee reports. This initial draft; can also be called as a Zero Document or Non Paper to facilitate further discussion has been handed over to the steering committee.
According to Lal after discussions in the steering committee a draft proposal for the new constitution will be ready for the constitution assembly.
At the same time Dr. Jayampathi Wickramarathne said I must categorically say that Mr. Sumanthiran or myself, are not involved in the expert committee work as they work independently, though the joint opposition tries to show a different picture. Jayampathi added The Steering Committee has decided to prepare a final report and we have no involvement in that process either and we have explained this in Parliament last week. The ball is in their court now. Inspite of these clarifications, Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) Chairman G. L. Peiris said that they had managed to obtain a draft copy of the new constitution which had been hatched in secrecy! He said it had been drafted with hatred towards the Rajapaksas and contained provisions that threatened national security and interests.
Prof. Peiris told the news conference that the motive behind new Constitution was the hatred towards the Rajapaksas. This is not the way to draft a new Constitution by targeting a particular group of people. No Constitution drafted in that manner is going to stand the test of time, he said and added that the draft had a provision for the abolition of the executive presidency and the post replaced by a ceremonial president. Prof. Peiris said a person who had served as executive president for two terms was barred from occupying even the ceremonial presidency. What a shame!
It means Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot be even a ceremonial president, he said and added that on the question of dual citizenship, anyone who had relinquished his foreign citizenship even 12 months previously was disqualified from contesting.
Executive power
Such a constitution is not going to serve national interests, Prof. Peiris said and pointed out that the proposed constitution would pose a serious threat to national security.
It is hilarious to say these things without participating in any discussions. They avoid discussions in the Steering committee or the constituent assembly or even open public debate. When they were in power they did not allow any democratic discussion, in particular when they brought the 18th Amendment. Any checks and balances that could have penetrated the amendment, were purposely blocked and therefore, depriving the country of the safeguards that should have been activated in a democracy.
The two-term limit was vital to Sri Lankas democratic governance as it acted as a check on the concentration of executive power and avoided promoting an authoritarian type rule, instead of democracy, which Mahinda was threatening to follow. The removal of this check meant that the president could continue for an unlimited number of terms and essentially granting the president a form of enduring immunity in office, in addition to the immunity from criminal and civil proceedings, if they continue getting re-elected for life.
At that point in time, Mahinda was seeking a third term in office. Unlimited term limits provide unfettered power to the executive and simultaneously, weaken the branches of the judiciary and the legislature to control and prevent abuse of power. Conceptions such as the separation of powers are made redundant, when one branch has overriding power and diminishes the capacity of the other branches to function.
Constitutional amendment
Furthermore, the demolition of this Constitutional Council meant that the President had unfettered power to appoint key public officers, including the Attorney General and the judges of the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. This is particularly alarming, as it gives the executive supreme control over the entire legal system, and undermines a citizens ability to seek redress through these legal mechanisms. It also enables the president to directly appoint members of commissions such as the Public Services commission, Human Rights Commission and the Commissions in charge of Investigating Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC).
Hand in hand not only do the two parts of the amendment dilute checks on the executives power, it gives virtually unchecked power to the executive. The constitutional amendment was a clear tool to help Rajapaksa construct a more authoritarian, significantly less democratic order. On one hand, people have a strong President who is trying to latch onto power indefinitely. And on the other, a President who has erased mechanisms of accountability so institutions like the courts, and the Attorney General, rather than serving as independent checks on his power, are now actively working on behalf of him. Additionally, the Supreme Courts reasoning for upholding this amendment endorsed it as being inherently democratic. It was argued that it widened the peoples choice to vote and that they were no longer restricted by the law as to who they wanted to lead the country.
Thus, we have a regime that seems democratic, where formal procedure is followed and Courts are given an opportunity to oversee amendments, where people can still vote, and elections are held. But at the same time, its underlying system is not democratic.
This makes it difficult for people to discern that the law is no longer being ordinarily operated by the government but rather, is used as a weapon to invert democracy and remove key organs that serve as defense mechanism for democracy.
It is amusing to hear cries for democracy from such a tyrant.

Striving for the Right Effort
There is no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at all. The idea that things must have a beginning is really due to the poverty of our thoughts. - Bertrand Russell
The most significant event on Nikini Poya was the holding of the First Dhamma Council or Sangayanava which was a landmark in the history of Sasana. The next being commencement of Vassana.
The First Dhamma Council was conducted under the auspicious of Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera, and patronized by King Ajasatta, at Rajagaha. The Buddha entered Parinibbana in his eightieth year. The pratagjana monks [those who have not attained any spiritual status] were grieving and crying, while some other Bhikkhus, especially who joined the order with ulterior motives requested the mourners not to weep. Subaddha, who joined the sasana in his old age, led this group and he addressed the grieving bhikkhus, he said they should be happy that they are now free from strict Vinaya rules imposed on them.
The Master is no more and that they can act the way they desired. Subaddha further expounded that the Master had been a hindrance to their freedom and liberty. Arhant Kassapa Thera on hearing the unhealthy saga decided to courageously step in to conduct the Sangha Council. The Arahant Thera just 21 days after the parinibbana of Buddha, decided that a Dhamma Sangayana must be held with the commencement of the rains retreat for putting things back in order. It was held three months after the demise of the Buddha, at Sattapanni Rock Cave in Rajagaha.
Matters discussed
Ananda, Upali and Anuruddha Theras assisted him as coordinators. Venerable Upali and Anuruddha Theros were Arhants and Ananda Thera achieved the status only the previous night, just a day before the council. Ananda Theras commanding retentive memory was tremendously useful in matters discussed before the council. Disciplining the Buddhist monk Order, was the top priority in the agenda of the first Sangayana held for the purpose of arresting the further decline of the Sasana and the Order. This is undoubtedly the top priority today as well.
Religious leaders lose divine charm when religion is politicized. Today Buddhist institutions have become adherents to competing political parties; this is the sad but true story of Buddhism and Maha Sangha in Sri Lanka. The Sangha has been drawn into the political field by leaders of both the political divide since SWRD Bandaranaike opened it up in 1956.
Once they are encouraged into the arena the political leaders become enslaved to their demands. When Bandaranaike attempted to resist their pressure he had to pay with his life. The successive governments continued the practice of politicising the religion and using the Buddhist monks to accomplish and help them in holding on to power. Regrettably, today the Maha Sangha has become a permanent team member in party politics. The fear of losing popular support at electoral contests prevents the politicians from questioning a violation of Vinaya by monks. Unfortunately, the Nikayas and Mahanayaka Theras are turning a blind eye to anti-Buddhist activities of some political bhikkhus. The task of cleansing the Sasana has to come from within the Sasana itself.
The Buddhist ascetic community is silent on introducing any necessary reforms allowing the staining of Sangha reputation to continue. It is actually a few of the monks who behave in an unacceptable way. The leaders of Buddhist societies like All Ceylon Buddhist Congress, the YMBA and learned bhikkhus who are leading university campuses can enforce pressure upon the Maha Nayake Theras to come forward and embark on such reforms before it further deteriorates.
The rainy retreat or Pasu Vas and Pera Vas
Anujanami Bhikkave Vassane Vassan Udaganja - I advise oh monks! To observe the rainy retreat during the Rainy Season, under one roof.
Actually, the rainy season commences with Esala full moon, when Monks are assigned to stay indoors and the Nikini Pasalosvaka is the beginning of Rainy Retreatthe Vas Season. Peravas is when the monks start their retreat  the day after the Esala poya. Pasuvas is observed by bhikkhus a month later on Nikini poya. The retreat is practised according to rules laid down for the monks by the Buddhathese are the two days for observing the Rainy Retreat Vassana. The Buddha advised the monks not to live outdoors, - in the open air, under trees, cemeteries and forests. They were instructed to live in the temples during the Rainy Season or Vassanasamaya.
Rainy retreat or Vas has two diverging views on how it originated. There is a school of thought which believes that the Awakened One imposed the regulation after detecting the suffering of a group of monks who called on him after walking an enormous distance on foot during extreme weather.
The monks had to experience untold misery due to adverse and excessive rainy weather on their way to Rajagaha. The other school of thought views it differently, that Bikkhus participation in spiritual activities and missionary jobs during the rainy period being regarded with contempt and denounced by Jain sects.
As Bikkhus exposing themselves to unfavourable weather came for severe criticism, and that the Buddha who always respected constructive criticism appreciated the Jains point of view on the matter and decided to recommend to the monks to confine themselves to the temple during the entire period of Vassana. Thus began the ritual vas or rainy retreat.
Concluding the first Council, Elder Maha Kassapa assigned the responsibility of conserving through memorizing and passing down to posterity, entire code of discipline to the chief in charge of discipline, Arahant Upali Maha Thera, and his retinue of students. Similarly, the responsibility of learning by heart and preserving, and passing down to posterity all of the long discourses; thirty-four in all, grouped as Digha Nikaya to Arahant Ananda Thero and his group of pupils. The Majjima Nikaya, [Middle Length Discourses] to Elder Sariputta Maha Thera and his students. The Samyuktha Nikaya, he kept to himself and his pupils, while the Anguttra Nikaya to Arahant Anuruddha Thera.
Many things can be achieved by appointing the right person at the right place. Capable persons should be appointed irrespective of religious differences, If true Dhamma is practised, this will eventually lead the way to good governance in our country. - Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera
Secularism and Dhamma
The Dhamma, as taught by the Buddha, leads to the cessation of suffering through an effort to gain insight into central truths about the human order. These truths are exclusively codified in the Dhamma as the four-fold truth, the eight-fold path and the twelve-fold dependent origination. The objective and result of the hard work and discoveries made by people who practice the path are released from suffering.
The Dhamma in actuality catalyzes our personal experiences that everything we are, see, smell, taste, think and feel is changing, impersonal and impermanent. Nibbana, is not part of any material universe, self, god, and which go beyond any fear, hate, delusion, ism or viewpoint, and is realised and can be entered by practising Dhamma.
As the Buddha unveils it, Dhammas empirical nature is one of its important features. The Dhamma is not a religion or philosophy, or the Buddhas viewpoint or belief. The Buddha only discovered Dhamma in the same way that Newton discovered gravity. The Dhamma exists, and the one who discovers and give further details about it is known as Buddha.
The notion of secularism makes a nation officially impartial and unbiased on matters of religion, it does not support a particular faith or religions.
A secular state takes care of all its citizens in the same way in spite of their spiritual affiliations, and stay away from preferential treatment for a citizen from a given religion over others. The secular country does not have a recognized religion.
Ego and craving
Since birth men are trained to see themselves as exceptional, they are certain to believe superior to those who do not fit into the same setting, culture, language, religion, and country. As long as they see themselves dissimilar from one another, the longing of the ego become bigger even more.
But that is all pretence, a daydream generating a separation between human races to make them think of an imaginary enemy.

TNA turns down Wiggies request to boycott Task Force meeting
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on Thursday turned down Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswarans request to boycott the meeting of the Presidential Special Task Force on Northern Development which is scheduled to be held on August 27.
TNA Parliamentarians at a meeting held at the Opposition Leaders office under the patronage of TNA leader R. Sampanthan on Thursday insisted that they should participate in this meeting to ensure development of the Northern Province.
They were of the view that development activities should continue in the North which was badly battered by the 30-year protracted war.
These Parliamentarians stressed the importance of participating in this Task Force meeting to find solutions to the burning issues of the Tamil people, that included releasing their lands occupied by the Security Forces.
Northern Province Chief Minister Wigneswaran in a letter to TNA leader R. Sampanthan had requested that the TNA should not support any development activity conducted by the government until a political solution is given to the ethnic issue.
Wigneswaran added that Tamil political representatives in the Northern Province had arrived at an unanimous decision not to join any committee or organization of the government until a solution is given to the Tamil peoples issue.
He added that Several Ministers and Security Forces officials have been included in this Speical Task Force and questioned as to why military officials have been appointed to the Special Task Force on Northern Development, which is solely aimed at bringing economic development to the Northern region.
The TNA should decide whether it needs economic development or a political solution first, Wigneswaran had stated in his letter to Sampanthan.

## Title: University  Industry Collaboration for Value Addition

University  Industry Collaboration for Value Addition
Excerpts from the Uva Wellassa University Convocation address 2018 delivered by Prof. Ananda Jayawardane, Director General, National Science Foundation, Senior Professor in Civil Engineering, University of Moratuwa and Former Vice-Chancellor, University of Moratuwa.
I have noted that over a relatively short history of 13 years, UWU has earned great reputation as an enterprising university in Sri Lanka with its vision to become the centre of excellence for value addition to the national resource base in Sri Lanka. I was really fascinated to see some of the core values of the university - entrepreneurship among all, interdisciplinary degree programmes and goal orientation. The key focus of the university is to carry out project based research with the theme of Value Addition, rather than conducting arbitrary research, and the modern entrepreneurial university concept with a strong science and technology focus offering flexible and interdisciplinary courses in order to meet the social, scientific and technological needs for national development indeed inspired me.
In this backdrop, at a time when the university is striving to be a modern entrepreneurial university with Value Addition as a focus, moving away from silos of knowledge and embracing an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary culture without friction or segregation, and at a time when the graduates turn a new chapter in their lives with the newly acquired qualification, moving from a learning environment to a more practicing and enterprising environment, I thought that it is appropriate to choose the topic University-Industry collaboration for value addition for my convocation address.
I will address this under 5 subtopics
1. Value addition status of our economy;
2. The need for university-industry collaboration;
3. The university preparedness and good practices;
4. The need for alignment of players and facilitation; and
5. Our collective role
1. Value addition status of our economy
In order to generate wealth for our country, we need to sell our products and provide our services outside our country and earn forex, and reduce importing products or services in an open economy not adopting any protectionist measures or enjoying subsidies, thereby saving our forex. This means that our products and services must be globally competitive. Selling them even within our country is a great challenge if they cannot be provided competitively, in other words if they can be obtained more economically through imports under the open economic policies.
Are we competitive globally Yes, in some but not in many. We have some success stories. For example, our electronic sensors are used by the worlds best car brands, our apparels are worn by the worlds top athletes in Olympics, our surgical gloves are used by the worlds top surgeons, our tyres are used in the worlds best aircrafts, our software and algorithms are used in the worlds leading stock exchanges, in doing over one billion eBay transactions per day, and several other similar stories. But the point is that this is not enough. Our trade deficit increases.
We cannot be happy about the Value Addition that we provide to our goods and services. It is through value addition to products and services that we can generate more wealth. Value addition takes place with knowledge and technology. For example, look at your smart phone. We are paying for value addition through the knowledge built in.
We are striving but not making significant headway in this value addition game. We have not been improving in our value added high tech products over decades and according to World Bank statistics in 2016, in Sri Lanka it stands at 1% of all exports. In India it is 7%, Thailand 22%, Malaysia 43% and Singapore 49%.
Despite our ambitious plans and strategies already set, such as Cabinet approved Science, Technology & Innovation Strategy for Sri Lanka in 2010 outlining many areas to be addressed, our governments have failed to meaningfully address the issues, invest finances and make a conducive environment. For example, according to the National Science Foundation published Sri Lanka Science, Technology and Innovation Statistics 2015, our R&D investment is 0.106% of GDP, the lowest in the region; it is 0.63% in India, 1.3% in Malaysia, and 2.2% in Singapore. Sri Lanka has only 6117 scientists in all fields and only 944 PhDs. It is 106 full time equivalent for a million population. In China, it is 1036, in Malaysia 2261 and in South Korea 7087. If we consider our patents which is an indicator of knowledge creation, in 2015 we obtained only 262 patents, while Malaysia obtained 7700.
Even for our long standing agriculture field we have not done a significant value addition or application of modern technology. We have plucked and processed Tea more or less the same way for many decades and have only marginal value addition in the product range, losing our competitiveness to countries like Kenya. We produce the best natural rubber in the world but are losing competitiveness due to low technology used in tapping and processing, due to substitution by synthetic rubber and due to diminishing production. There is no significant value addition in products except in the solid tyre industry; instead, we export raw rubber and import erasers. We produce the best Cinnamon in the world but import many value added products including medicines and perfumes. In this backdrop, the firm resolve of UWU on Value addition to our natural resources base and carrying out research targeting industry issues, and producing enterprising graduates must be truly commended. I earnestly believe that the UWU and its graduates will play a leading role in overcoming these challenges.
2. The need for university-industry collaboration
Today, the universities cannot be considered as halls of knowledge and learning if they are producing graduates and postgraduates and carrying out research and knowledge creation in an ad hoc way. Despite the academic freedom enjoyed in the universities for academics to work and carry out research in their own areas of academic pursuits, there is increasing global pressure for the universities to have stronger partnerships with the industry, to produce graduates targeted for industry needs, to carry out research to solve industry problems and to develop and transfer cutting edge technologies for industry competitiveness. In fact, research and development investment in the universities are now increasingly targeted for outputs and soon there will be no funds allocated for ad hoc research where research benefits are not targeted for social and economic prosperity.
There are many examples of very fruitful university industry partnerships and university driven industry clusters. For example, Silicon Valley where over 2,000 tech companies are doing their innovations is a Stanford University initiative. Most pharmaceutical corporations world over work very closely with universities for drugs development and testing. Many developed countries and increasingly developing countries get the services of university experts to do their research and development with many mutual benefits. In Japan, such collaborations are identified as Need-Seed, where industry needs are addressed by the university academics identified as Seeds. In Sri Lanka too such fruitful collaborations are evolving with many spill over benefits. For example, University of Moratuwa (UOM) collaborates with the industry in many ways and similar initiatives are already existing or evolving in other universities too including UWU.
3. The university preparedness and good practices
The most influential factors for effective universityindustry collaboration is the University Vision, incorporation of that vision in the Strategic Management Plan and the successive top management commitment for its realisation. For example, the UOM vision is to be the most globally recognised knowledge enterprise in South Asia. We need to inculcate in the minds of the university community and other stakeholders including the industry that we would like to be a knowledge enterprise, meaning that the university focus is not only teaching and research but also many enterprising activities with outward orientation, taking risks without breaking regulations, leveraging generated funding, proactive development and implementation of policies and projects with positive influence.
The biggest strength of the UOM is the use of many different mechanisms for effective university-industry collaboration as briefly explained below.
A forum for university-industry dialogue
This is where every academic department is supposed to meet the industry once every 6 months to discuss many aspects for mutual benefit. At UOM we call it Department Industry Consultative Boards (DICBs). The composition of the DICB is 50% department academic staff including industrial training and 50% industry partners representing key employers and strategic organisations.
An external commercial arm
The UOM has an external commercial arm - UNI Consultancy Services (UNIC). This is an entity registered under the Company Registrar as an Association Limited by Guarantee with voluntary membership limited to academic staff of the University.
Accounts are audited by an independent audit firm and the university maintains an arms length relationship with this entity. One important advantage of UNIC is that it can bid for projects using resources in and out of the university. When the university human resources are used an agreed percentage of any payment made to university academics should be given to the university as a donation.
Industry funded R&D laboratories
This is a mechanism where the industry invests for research by providing funds to the university to establish research facilities, pay for staff and meet other expenses to carry out research and development which has immediate commercial potential. The university provides expertise, space and research students where relevant. The UOM has been very successful with such collaborations in a range of technological developments. From the point of view of the industry, such collaborations provide solutions to problems that the industry is not equipped to answer by itself without the help of the multidisciplinary expertise available at the university.
They expose industry researchers to new research trends, advanced technical and analytical approaches and novel experimental techniques. They can identify improvements in processes and develop new products driven by new technologies and help to meet the challenges of the price competitive, and quality conscious global market.
From the point of view of the university, such collaborations provide increased recognition to the University, opportunities for academics to disseminate knowledge gained through research programmes, capacity building for academics on handling real industrial problems and additional income to the technical staff. Furthermore, they facilitate more effective utilization of laboratory equipment, upgrading of laboratory facilities, opportunities for undergraduates and postgraduates to conduct strategic research, obtaining research grants under public-private partnership and opportunities to attract high quality research students to pursue research leading to PhDs.
Industry funded endowed chairs
Our universities have strategic areas which need a real push and a champion to lead. Such champions are difficult to draw from academic staff specifically in new areas. This is where the industry support can be obtained to establish endowed positions with high remuneration to attract external champions for limited tenure. UOM has benefitted significantly by two such endowments initially to establish a chair for entrepreneurship and subsequently to broad base it to cover both innovation and entrepreneurship.
These initiatives have led to change the university culture to embrace innovation and entrepreneurship as key areas with enhanced efforts by staff and students, rapid increase of university start-ups and spin-offs, establishment of The Enterprise  the universities innovation and entrepreneurship incubator and several other initiatives towards realising the university vision.
4. The need for alignment of players and facilitation
Productive and fruitful university-industry collaboration takes place in a positive and conducive environment. Otherwise, spurts of individual initiatives will soon die due to frustration, constraints and lack of support from the system. Creation of such a conducive environment is broadly referred to as the creation of an eco-system. Such as eco-system needs alignment of players, avoidance of bottlenecks, put in place facilitating incentives, lubricating available mechanisms and many others. Do we have such an eco-system In my view we still do not. Instead we have many barriers and bottle necks, some of which of course can be overcome leveraging provisions and with innovative thinking. However, we might need to respond to lot of audit queries and COPE inquiries when the system does not have clear provisions.
We are aware that in a competitive world people work for rewards and recognition except for a few who will still work with their conscience for a cause and not expect rewards. What are the incentives for university academics to have effective university-industry collaboration Do they contribute to their promotion Do they contribute to the academic work load Do they affect your university salary No they do not. However, there are several other benefits in different ways such as reputation building of involving academics, additional remuneration, new case studies for your teaching, ideas and facilities for your research, more research students etc. They are indirect and not all academics are motivated to take such initiatives outside their normal duties.
It is however, heartening to note that several actions are being taken by the UGC to establish more effective university-industry collaborations through the establishment of university business cells. The latest World Bank project AHEAD is also addressing this aspect by providing funds and incentives for such collaboration while the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) project is facilitating enabling an intellectual environment coordinated by the Coordinating Secretariat of Science and Technology (COSTI), National Intellectual Property Office (NIPO), NSF and universities. Despite these efforts, if we look at international practices, a very important function of a university is technology transfer and in order to facilitate this, every university has a fully-fledged technology transfer office. These tech transfer professionals have formed the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM) comprising more than 3,200 members who work in more than 800 institutions around the globe with the mission to support and advance academic technology transfer globally (www.autm.net).
The university system needs flexibility and autonomy in some aspects. Creation of new strategic entities, new types of cadre to manage university business cells or entities, their flexible ways of recruitment, flexible accountability as research and development cannot always be successful leading to commercialisation, risk tolerance in inventing and in innovation and so forth. Are we ready to meet an industry need in a timely manner among the other in house duties of academics Are we prepared to address issues in an inter-disciplinary and multi-disciplinary perspective for more realistic solutions
This is where, the alignment of all players are needed if we are serious about effective university-industry collaboration.
5. Our collective role
The most important way for effective university-industry collaboration is the facilitation of the eco-system. This is where different payers  individual universities, University Grants Commission, Ministry of Higher Education and other relevant ministries, the Treasury, Department of Management Services, National Procurement Agency and instruments such as national policies, institutional priorities facilitate a common goal with appropriate incentives and compulsion. We also need to be open to interdisciplinary collaboration. Today, due to the complex nature of issues and solutions we need in an advanced society and industry, it is not possible to identify solutions in our own silos of expertise. We need to collaborate with individuals and teams having multidisciplinary capabilities, first to understand the true nature of the areas to be addressed and then to develop realistic solutions looking from all angles and all perspectives.
For example, when we do research and develop solutions for Value Added agriculture, the experts in UWU should collaborate with the Department of Agriculture, say Moratuwa University where modern technological inputs can be developed such as drone technology and precision agriculture, microbiologists, genetic experts, farmers, technology developers, industry and end users. How many projects can we count with such interdisciplinary collaboration
These efforts should also be facilitated by institutions like National Science Foundation, where I currently work in ensuring such interdisciplinary team work targeting specific outcomes leading to commercialisation and practical application. It is heartening to see the dedication of the UWU in correctly identifying the vision, goals and strategies to produce entrepreneurs, carry out outcome based research and focus on value addition. It is clearly a challenge for us to realise this vision and I am sure the top management, the Vice-Chancellor with his vision guided by the University Council, Senate and the Faculties, and the industry supported by the alumni of the university will do their utmost to ensure the realisation of its vision and goals.
Our success can be judged not only by the number of graduates we produce and the number of academic publications our academics contribute, but also the true Value Addition we can talk about which has made our industries truly competitive. While the university will strive to do the best for you the key message for the graduates passing out today is that it is your performance mainly that will demonstrate the extent of Value Addition that we realise and the impact on the competitiveness that you make in the global market.

Weightlifter aljumaili bags iraq's first gold
Safaa Aljumaili stole the weightlifting show Friday, ripping off his shirt and screaming in wild celebration after a dramatic last-gasp lift secured Iraq's first gold of the Asian Games.
It was Iraq's first medal of any colour at the 18th Asiad and was greeted with jubilant scenes at the Jakarta International Expo arena. As Aljumaili roared in delight he was joined by an Iraqi team official who kissed the platform several times in thanks.
Aljumaili had already failed with the 202kg he needed for gold but somehow managed to lock out his arms on the final lift of the 85kg competition to pip South Korea's brave Jang Yeon-hak by just 1kg. Jang was left with silver after collapsing on his final 197kg attempt and
being stretchered away wearing an oxygen mask. North Korea's Jon Myong Song took the bronze, after watching his team-mates sweep to a national-record fifth weightlifting gold in the women's 63kg,
along with a first ever Asian Games women's one-two. Little-known Kim Hyo Sim pulled off a shock win, trouncing her namesake compatriot and Rio Olympic silver medallist Choe Hyo Sim by the huge margin of 12kg.
Wamalun Rattanawan was delighted to take bronze on 225kg, the fifth medal for the consistent Thailand weightlifting team (one silver, four bronze).
JAPAN SWIM QUEEN IKEE WINS RECORD SIXTH GOLD
Japan's golden girl Rikako Ikee stormed to a record sixth Asian Games swimming title on Friday, marking a handful of other firsts for good measure.
Competing for elbow room on the final evening, China's colossus Sun Yang crushed the men's 1,500m to finish with a fab four individual freestyle titles in Jakarta.
But Ikee stole the show by edging the 50m freestyle sprint by a fingertip from China's Liu Xiang, clocking 24.53 seconds to become the first woman in any sport to scoop six gold medals at a single Games.
The 18-year-old allowed herself a rare display of emotion, raising a fist as she soaked up the applause of her besotted Japanese fans before shedding a few tears as the enormity of her achievement sank in. Ikee, who is poised to be the face of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in her home city, finished with eight medals in total -- also a joint record.
North Korea shooter So Gin Man pocketed seven gold medals and eight overall in 1982.
Japan's Yasuhiro Koseki completed an Asian Games breaststroke treble in the 50m final and perhaps ushered title-holder Dmitriy Balandin into retirement.. Koseki clocked 27.07 with Kazakhstan's Balandin, an Olympic gold medallist in Rio two years ago, taking bronze in 27.46 behind China's Yan Zibei (27.25).
China's 16-year-old sensation Wang Jianjiahe smashed the 400m free final, winning in a Games-best 4:03.18 to secure a hat-trick of individual titles. South Korean Kim Seo-yeong upset Japan's Yui Ohashi to capture gold in the women's 200m individual medley in 2:08.34.
TURKMEN DOPING CASE PUTS WRESTLING UNDER PRESSURE
A wrestler from Turkmenistan became the first doping case at the Asian Games and has been disqualified, the Olympic Council of Asia said Friday, days after it threatened to expel the worst-offending sports from future tournaments.
Rustem Nazarov tested positive for the banned substance furosemide, a masking agent, in a pre-tournament urine test last week, the OCA said. Nazarov has been disqualified from the 18th Jakarta-Palembang Asian Games 2018... and his results during the competition held on the 19th August annulled, said a statement.
The athlete, 24, had competed in the men's 57kg freestyle event and was defeated in his first match. His compatriot Shyhazberdi Ovelekov won bronze in the men's Greco-Roman 87kg category on Wednesday. - AFP

Worlds oldest active cricket ground under threat
Mitcham Cricket Green, Surrey often features in quiz questions, for being universally accepted as the oldest cricket ground still in use. The first documented cricket match on the ground dates back to 1685. To provide perspective, this was the year when James II succeeded Charles II to the throne; William Dampier had not yet spotted Australia; the city of Calcutta had not yet been founded; and the Massachusetts Witch Trials were still some years away.
According to a report in The Guardian, Mitcham Cricket Green is now under threat of being sold to developers. A site recently acquired by Phoenix Group Investments includes their 115-year-old pavilion, the Burn Bullock (a pub named after Surrey batsman and Mitcham stalwart Burnett Bullock), and a car park. Phoenix has apparently planned to build a 70-room hotel on the car park, which will involve demolition of the equipment shed.
Mitcham Secretary and womens team captain, Julia Gault, revealed that Phoenix has revealed little details regarding the future of the site: Theyd leave us with a set of plans we never wanted. Wed end up homeless, we couldnt continue playing cricket on that ground, which would be the end of over 300 years of history but also the end of cricket for this community. It would be a terrible, terrible shame.
Most of the young people who play for us are at state schools. The subs are very low, 42 a year. Most clubs are two, three, four times that. We know a lot of people who come to us cant afford more than that. We are incredibly multicultural, with children from every cricket-playing nation and quite a few others. We have joked that the first Afghan to play for England might come from the club. Weve got Sri Lankans, Pakistanis, Indians, Caribbean, African heritage, Europeans, even a Lithuanian.
Because we dont have a confirmed tenancy with the current name of the leaseholder on it, we cant do things like apply for grants. Every pound we have to raise ourselves. Most grant-giving organisations want to see youve got rights to be in the building youre in.
Eventually well get to the point where we need something really major done, like the roof repairs on a building that as far as anyone else is concerned we dont have any rights to occupy, which is very bizarre seeing as it was built for us.
However, there has been support for Mitcham from various corners, from the public, local councillors and cricketers. Alec Stewart has requested people to show your support for a fine cricket club with a proud history and we hope a bright future too.

Crowning a Rajapaksa only a dream
None of the Rajapaksa family members as a prospective Presidential candidate would be a challenge to a common Presidential candidate as he would contest with the approval and patronage of a number of main parties in the current ruling alliance, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva said.
He was addressing the media at Dakshina Paya in Labuduwa, Galle, recently. Under any circumstances, the United National Party would support a Common Candidate for the third consecutive time, as the countrys contemporary political reality commands so. Hence, the Common Candidate, who secures the blessings of the majority of leading political parties and movements in the country, has the capacity to face any of the prospective candidates of the Rajapaksa family, he added.
Under even favourable conditions at the previous Local Government Election, the Podu Jana Perumuna could not secure even 50 percent of the total aggregate of voters. By now, the situation has changed.
Chances are more for a common nominee brought forward by a number of parties led by the SLFP and UNP to win the next Presidential election, the Chief Minister said. In such a unified effort, many of the groups and fractions loyal to the Joint Opposition would also join hands with a Common Candidate.
Hence, the dream of crowning a Rajapaksa will never come true, the Chief Minister added.

Mahinda Rajapaksa sold prime land to Chinese
It is none other than former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who sold valuable lands in the High Security Zone to the Chinese, said Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim.
Mahinda Rajapaksas policies were detrimental to the country, he added.
The minister was addressing a public gathering presided by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to hand over land deeds to 1,560 persons who live in crown lands in Kegalle.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, without showing any concern for the country or its interests, sold 50 acres of precious land of the Army Headquarters in the heart of Colombo, and the Fort to build a hotel and Port City, he said.
However, the country was fortunate that those deeds were converted into leases by the present government, with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes efforts, the minister said.
The minister added that the previous government did not settle the payments due to those whose lands were acquired by the government.
When we took over power in 2015, we also took over a legacy of monumental debts piled up by the earlier regime. In 2015, a debt of a staggering Rs. 7,400,000 million had to be settled.
Yet, we did not curtail the welfare of the people nor did we halt our development projects. All these continued smoothly. Yet, the cocktail society of Colombo is critical of the government, he said. It is the fervent objective of the Premier that every citizen should have a house, land, job and an income. This was the first time in Sri Lankas history that the two major parties were united to solve the countrys problems, which could not be solved by the previous government despite its tenure of 20 years, the minister said.
Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe, Land and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatileke and State Minister Champika Premadasa also spoke.

Ashwin was foolish to reveal his tricks to Ian Ward: Gavaskar
Ravichandran Ashwin has had a couple of dry test matches after starting with a 7-wicket haul in the first one against England.
The first test  which India lost narrowly by 31 runs  was marked by two identical (read magical) deliveries from Ashwin which removed English opener Alastair Cook in both the innings of the match in similar fashion.
But since that tremendous start, Ashwin after toiling mercilessly for a combined 41 overs in the next two test matches, has been able to bag just one wicket.
Yes you heard that right.
Indias spin-cordon head, Ravichandran Ashwins form after his 7-wicket opener has dipped to a dismal wicket-less second test at Lords and then a one wicket stint at Trent Bridge.
So, why such a performance you ask
Apparently, it could be due to an interview given by Ashwin to former cricketer and journalist Ian Ward.
In his interview with Ward after the first test match, when asked about how should youngsters go about their techniques, Ashwin not only demonstrated his grips but also revealed his actions for particular deliveries.
This recording will no doubt be used by the England think tank and especially their batsmen when they sit down before every Test to plan how to counter the Indian bowlers and particularly Ashwin, wrote Gavaskar in his column with the Sportstar Live.
It was understandable why Gavaskar was not amused by the whole incident.
Ashwin went onto tell Ian Ward about the deliveries that he had developed over the past 24 months and further gave out a step by step breakdown of his multiple variations.
Sunil Gavaskar said it was like a magician revealing his bag of tricks to the audience. Perhaps it wont make a difference and Ashwin will go on to bag heaps of wickets in the rest of the series too, but if he doesnt then he has only himself to blame.
While, of course, the theory clicked with quite a few people, some were of the opinion that he had done it deliberately.
But the fact of the matter remains that Ashwin has only picked up one wicket in the last two test matches against England.
In times when technology is used day in and day out to gain tactical advantages over the opponent and players are constantly trying to develop new variations and hide their secrets, Ashwins casual chat has been seen by Indian cricket pundits as a case of over-confidence which could eventually end up hurting him and the Indian team during their tour of England.

During Sri Lanka-South Africa cricket series
Coca-Cola gives back life to pet bottles
Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) launched its Give Back Life partnership with Sri Lanka Cricket during the South Africa- Sri Lanka cricket series held from 12 July to 14 August across Galle, Colombo, Dambulla, and Kandy. Committed to making strides in achieving high volumes of PET collection and recycling in Sri Lanka, the Company launched its custom PET plastic collection bins at the respective venues during the series.
The Give Back Life campaign educates every person to recycle your PET bottle to give it new life thereby maximising the use of PET plastic bottles as a recyclable material. Coca-Cola staff on the ground at each of the stadiums wore Give Back Life t-shirts overseeing the collection and spreading the message to all the gathered spectators to make sure they responsibly dispose and recycle their PET plastic bottles.
This is yet another initiative by Coca-Cola to ensure any PET plastic bottle is recovered and recycled, supporting waste management schemes and preventing it unnecessarily journeying to landfills.
Jerome Jayaratne - Chief Operating Officer, Sri Lanka Cricket noted, The Sri Lanka-South Africa tournament was a keenly contested one and attracted large crowds to the stadiums. We are pleased to have Coca-Cola support and encourage the sport of cricket in Sri Lanka. Furthermore, Sri Lanka Cricket is pleased to be associated with CCBSLs Give Back to Life PET recycling campaign, which was launched during the cricket tournament. We believe this campaign is getting the attention it deserves and it was heartening to see the cricket fans at the Pallekelle stadium choosing to stay back and clean-up, disposing of their waste in a responsible manner. This is a great message for all cricket fans and we hope more take up the cause.
Commenting on engaging with Sri Lanka Cricket on this far-reaching campaign of PET collection and recycling, Mayank Arora - Managing Director, CCBSL, said, Partnerships like this with Sri Lanka Cricket, showcase the many opportunities to be maximised in providing local solutions to waste management and recycling. CCBSL is committed to PET collection and recycling. We aim with this initiative to create awareness, that if disposed responsibly, PET plastic is valuable and can be recycled benefitting peoples livelihoods. We strive towards an effective, impactful, waste management solution for PET plastic.

The convenience of political amnesia
Forgetfulness is emerging as a tool of convenient politics. The Presidential Commission inquiry into the Central Bank Bond Scam saw then important Minister Ravi Karunanayake forget millions worth of payments for a Penthouse rent. The payment of millions by Perpetual Treasuries or its associated companies have made two ministers forgetful of how such monies came their way. We now have former President Mahinda Rajapaksa forgetful of an important telephone call from then Cabinet Minister Karu Jayasuriya, relating to the Keith Noyahr abduction.
That was ten years ago  May 2008. Such absence of memory is understandable due to all the politics he has gone through since then, including his defeat in the last presidential election and return to parliamentary politics.
However, there is also the strong possibility of such forgetfulness extending to so many other matters of his presidency, the cause of his defeat in the last presidential poll. Such memory blocks could help him escape thoughts about the extent of corruption during the near decade of his presidency. Yet, the current Presidential Commission probe into the activities of SriLankan Airways and Mihin Lanka, must certainly remind him of the appointment of his brother-in-law Nishantha Wickramasinghe as the Chairman of SriLankan, who clearly brought huge corruption to the National Carrier. Would he have also forgotten the funds of Siriliya Saviya, largely directed by his wife, and all the corrupt practices of his son Namal, which are now before the courts
Although Mahinda Rajapaksa may have forgotten the threat of near death faced by journalist Keith Noyahr, it is good for him to refresh his mind about it. Such memory refreshment (if needed) is also good about the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunga, the so-called fatal accident of rugby captain Wasim Thajudeen, and the abduction of Prageeth Eknaligoda. These are all matters of crime under the Rajapaksa regime, now before the courts. The public have certainly not forgotten these attacks on democracy and the right to life of the people. In addition, these matters would also involve memories of other members of the Rajapaksa family, who held high office and wielded power in MRs years of presidency.
Political amnesia is certainly helpful to those seeking to avoid the reprisals from crooked politics. However, it cannot erase from the mind of the public contempt for those who directed such crimes and were closely involved in them. There is an overall delay in bringing these criminals to justice. The FCID, all investigative bodies, and the judiciary, should speedily bring all perpetrators of these crimes to deserving justice, with a revival of memories. Inform the public of all valid information about these crimes, and obstruction to the probes by the lingering forces of corruption.
Presidential poll
The move by the Joint Opposition (JO) to make Mahinda Rajapaksa a candidate in the next Presidential Poll, despite the restriction on the number of terms a person could be President of Sri Lanka, under the 19th Amendment, shows the divisions within the JO on the choice of its candidate.
The main legal opinion on this has come from the JOs Chairman, Prof. G. L. Peiris, a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo, with his career in the academic field of law. The proposal is an attack on the 19th Amendment, which removed more than two-term period for the presidency, brought about by Mahinda Rajapaksa himself, through the 18th Amendment. What MR introduced with 18A was similar to what prevails in many African democracies, where the presidents serve for several terms going on for nearly three decades. It was MRs move to be in office until his son Namal could take over, and continue the Rajapaksa Raja Vaasala. The 19A removed this. The argument now is that the restoration of the two-term limit for the presidency is a prospective move related to the future, and has no retrospective application  thereby enabling MR to contest again.
The Supreme Court must decide on the matter. GL Peiris expects to take this before the District Court, which will refer it to the Supreme Court, due to restrictions on seeking the advice of the SC on such a matter. Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama, a learned academic in law who has been teaching abroad for many years, is supportive of this view. However, there are other legal opinions that strongly differ, such as Dr. Jayampathy Wickremaratne, whose speciality is Constitutional Law, and was engaged in drafting the 19A, and many other leading academics and practitioners of law.
The 19A is the subject of considerable opposition by the JO, and political parties and groups opposed to changing the JR Jayewardene Constitution of 1978, which Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa, have been strongly opposed to in manifestos and other policy statements. GL Peiris has all these years, while in Chandrikas and MRs Cabinets opposed the JR Constitution. However, the present political move, including by sections of the Sangha, is to retain it, especially with regard to the Executive Presidency. Although MR has so far not expressed much support for the GL Peiris thinking, he is not likely to oppose it, if the Supreme Court decides the 19A term limit is not relevant, and the provisions in the 18A, of more than two terms is accepted. A path to the return of the Maha Rajaneni.
This is certainly a major legal worry to the public  more than 6 million (51.28%) who voted to defeat MR in January 2015, with the reduction of the terms of the presidency being a key slogan of the campaign.
The JO will certainly have to seek proper legal opinion or a SC ruling with speed, because delays that could lead to a loss of its goal, will adversely affect its campaign for the coming presidential poll. It will resume the infighting within the Rajapaksa Family on the candidacy of Gotabhaya or Basil, with MRs related concerns for the future of Namal.
The Supreme Court had to decide recently on the opinion sought by President Maithripala Sirisena, on his ability to remain President for six years, and not five years as said in the 19A. He thought that being elected before the 19A was adopted in May 2015; his term of office would be six years as earlier. The SC held that his term was limited to five years, under 19A. A possible thinking on the retrospective possibilities suggested for MRs continued candidacy.
Public sector size and reality
A government clearly divided over many issues affecting the public has recently overcome two major issues  the threatened strikes by the Railway employees, and bus drivers and operators. The public reaction to the very badly timed Railway strike, and the lack of support within the bus services to the threatened bus strike, would have contributed to this. The government should look into the possibilities of closer association with the public, to bring about better understanding on issues manipulated by anti-government forces, leading to strikes.
The Commission to Review Public sector Salaries, to recommend optimal salary structures for the State Sector, devoid of salary anomalies, is a major step forward to bring about a more efficient and functional public service. The recent statement by Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera calling for a total halt to recruitment in the public sector is an important proposal that requires proper follow up. It is certainly not a politically successful proposal. However, it is the responsibility of a government to think beyond immediate popularity, and the wider and future interests of society.
For the past several decades, every government, Green, Blue or of combined colours, have been packing the public sector  departments, corporations and other organisations, with political supporters, with no concern for the success of the institutions. As the Daily News editorial in Thursday (23) quoted Minister Samaraweera, there are 3,000 workers in a government office when the requirement is only for 1,000; there indeed is something badly wrong somewhere, which calls for immediate remedial action. No doubt, this situation is brought about by the fact that both major parties are today sharing power. If, prior to this, only the winning party stuffed state bodies with their supporters, we now have public sector institutions having to take the combined weight of unproductive labour at the cost of the tax payer, although UNP MPs bemoan that they are yet unable to get jobs for their supporters even though it was the Greens who were at the levers of power.
This is certainly an expose of the harsh reality of the public sector. Even in the final year of the Coalition of Unity, with its known differences, this calls for action to have a functional and efficient public sector in this country, which is manageable with its economy. It also calls for serious study of educational patterns in the country, which will help trained and trainable youth, to a society and economy that will soon face the realities of the Digital Revolution. This is a challenge that is both political and overly national, calling for strong commitment by government and the private sector.

The proposal on banning those under 35 years from driving three wheelers for hire was always a controversial one, with multiple implications and angles. It would have applied only to new applications, and not to existing operators. There are nearly 1.2 million three wheelers in circulation around the country, at least one million of which accept passengers on hire. The rest are used as company and private vehicles that do not accept fare-paying passengers.
Proponents of the ban were of the view that easy access to three wheelers (it is still the cheapest vehicle, barring motorcycles) has veered the youth away from other possible vocations and even higher educational opportunities. Three wheelers are used mostly as a last-mile transport option (say, from the bus station to ones home). If a three wheeler is parked near such a high-traffic place, the driver can easily earn more than Rs.2,000 per day from the up and down runs. Rainy days usually bring an additional windfall.
There were other concerns too. With cash in hand by 2-3 p.m. the drivers, mostly youth, tend to get addicted to other vices such as drugs and alcohol. In the exhilaration of youth, road rules seem like a distraction. Three wheelers, especially those driven by youth, are notorious for breaking all road rules and especially for making abrupt U-turns while in traffic. In fact, three wheelers and maniacally driven private buses are responsible for the majority of road accidents. After 35, most people have a better outlook on life and tend to literally take things slowly. There is some reluctance to take risks as one gets older.
In the opposing camp were those who maintained that barring youth from the three wheeler business would be a violation of their rights, apart from the fact that it would cut off a considerable number of youth from a self-employment or revenue generation avenue. Once a youth begins to operate a three-wheeler his income levels go up and the society also gets a new transport option. In some remote villages, a three wheeler could literally be a matter of life and death  patients are often transported by three wheeler to the nearest hospital, which could be 15-20 Km away. Besides, on-hire three wheelers often double up as a family vehicle for the owner and/or the driver, lessening their dependence on erratic public transport.
Considering all these aspects, the Cabinet has revoked the Gazette Notification barring those below 35 years from obtaining three-wheeler driving licenses. The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry had earlier issued the gazette which permitted only those above 35 years of age to apply for the driving licence for three-wheelers. The Cabinet of Ministers has now insisted there should be no bar on any age group from 18 onwards to operate three wheelers.
But this still calls for addressing the concerns expressed by both camps. Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera, a strong opponent of the age bar, has said that a special agency would be established to regulate the three wheeler service by providing proper training and guidance to those involved in the industry. This is a very timely proposal. Half the accidents involving three wheelers can be reduced if they are driven properly, respecting road rules. The Government has already made taxi meters compulsory and it should also be made compulsory to display an information sheet on the operator that includes name, age, address, ID number, police division and normal operational area (ex: Colombo Fort).
The Government must intervene pro-actively in this regard. One recent example is the training given to three wheeler operators in tourist hotspots under the Tuk Tuk initiative. The three wheelers are clearly labeled, which means that tourists can hop into them without any trepidation. This scheme should be extended islandwide. Likewise, the entry of both local and foreign ride hailing companies to the three wheeler arena bodes well for the industry (and other road users) as these companies provide additional training and also scrutinize potential drivers before recruitment. The police must conduct regular on-the-spot checks to nab errant three wheeler drivers, including those who operate without a driving licence and insurance. The Government must also create other income avenues for the youth, which can make three wheelers a less attractive proposition. For a start, construction and farming should be made more attractive to youth.
But at the end of the day, we do need a viable alternative to the three wheeler, which is a fundamentally unsafe vehicle. There is a need for a proper taxi service that uses vehicles with four wheels and four doors. Many experts have called for a gradual phasing out of three wheelers at least in the Western Province by 2030-2035, given that they do not sync with the concept of a highly developed megapolis. Besides, the advent of driverless vehicles in a couple of decades will render taxi drivers useless, with unmanned autonomous cars at our beck and call any time of the day. We must plan for the future now without necessarily making this a political issue.

Court officer charged for defrauding state money
Galle Elpitiya Magistrate Gayan Meegahage remanded a female government Management Assistant of the Elpitiya Magistrates Court until August 27. She was produced before him for allegedly defrauding money paid for cash bails imposed by the Magistrate in respect of corresponding suspects.

Elliott retires from all forms of cricket
Auckland FRIDAY: Allrounder Grant Elliott, who starred in New Zealand's historic win in the 2015 World Cup semi-final, has quit all forms of cricket after finishing his stint as the captain of Birmingham Bears in the Vitality Blast in England.
After finishing sixth in the North Group in the T20 tournament and not being able to qualify for the quarter-finals, Elliott announced his retirement on his Instagram account on Tuesday evening.
Elliott, 39, played five Tests, 83 ODIs and 17 T20Is. His six off Dale Steyn in the dying moments of the rain-curtailed 2015 World Cup semi-final will probably be the highlight of his career. He top-scored with 83 in the final too, against Australia, but New Zealand finished runners-up.

This emotional letter written to TMS proves cricket is more than a game
A letter read out by cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew detailing the life and death of a readers father has had people reaching for the tissues.
Listener Patrick Taylor emailed Test Match Special (TMS) telling them about his dad John who, unlike the current England batting line-up, dug in and battled doggedly to reach 83 when he then left the field of play.
What followed was a letter like no other, smartly chronicling Johns life and its struggles as he grew older and with TMS an important thread through the years. It prompted the TMS team to share the clip online, with commentary box footage, and captions Its more than just a game and Sometimes we get messages that are more important than anything that happens out in the middle.
Patricks letter bowled fans over with cricketing analogies about his fathers life, explaining how his dad had built gradually to his 50s before there was some unexpected cloud cover just as he was about to enter retirement.
John, a pharmacist and father of two, had been dealt a beamer in the form of leukaemia, the yorker of muscular dystrophy, the googly of Parkinsons, the reverse swing of diabetes, and latterly was struck down by the vicious bouncer of dementia.
Despite the bad hand, the Yorkshireman squeezed every last drop out of life, his son wrote.
And it was TMS which gave Patrick one final moment with his dad.
Although doctors said John might not regain consciousness after a bad chest infection had seen him rushed to hospital on August 9, when Patrick turned on TMS he woke up.
It afforded Patrick the opportunity to tell his dad he was loved and a wonderful father and share a proper goodbye.
After some 15 minutes, the instruction was to listen to the cricket with Chris Woakes making his maiden Test century at Lords. John Taylor died just after England secured victory at the home of cricket.
The considered letter generated a mass of praise for Patrick and the wider TMS family, with others sharing how the show has been a source of comfort for them too.
The reading, during Englands Test against India at Trent Bridge, had other listeners reaching for the tissues and praising Aggers for keeping his cool with the delivery.
Agnew later posted on Twitter that he delivered it blind, meaning he hadnt read the whole thing before he read it out.

Five greatest tennis players of all time
Tennis is one of the most popular games in the world and has been graced by many great players over the decades. The sport can be very demanding at the highest level as it tests both the physical stamina and the mental focus of a player. Whether one is trying to return a 200 kmph serve, attempting to get to a ball at the baseline, or surging towards the net, one needs to be supremely fit and agile.
At the same time, it is a surface-oriented game and the playing conditions can vary a lot. A tennis match can be played on a slow clay court, a much faster grass court or a more neutral hard court, and the requisite skill-sets also keep changing according to the playing surface.
Over the decades, Tennis has been graced by some great champions who have enthralled us with their performances. The game has undergone a lot of evolution too as the wooden racquets have been replaced by the graphite ones and players have got fitter and stronger.
Therefore, it is not easy to select top 5 players in the history of tennis. However, we have finalized an all-time list on the basis of their overall career records, performances at Grand Slams and completeness of their game.
5. BJORN BORG (SWEDEN)
The Swedish champion remains the only player to have shown unrivaled supremacy in both the French Open and the Wimbledon. Borg had won 6 consecutive French Open titles and 5 consecutive Wimbledon titles before retiring at the age of only 27.
He had made it to a 6th consecutive Wimbledon final in 1981 but lost to John McEnroe. He retired soon after that, maybe because he had already achieved everything by then.
Besides McEnroe, Borg enjoyed great rivalries against the likes of Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl and Ilie Nastase but remained the pick of the lot by some distance.
He was a baseliner who used to commit very few errors and wear his opponents down with his clinical efficiency. Borg won 11 Grand Slams and 64 career singles titles. He was known as the Iceman because of his ice-cool and seemingly unaffected demeanor.
4. PETE SAMPRAS (USA)
Pete Sampras is unquestionably the greatest grass-court player of all time. He won 7 Wimbledon titles in his career, a record that has only been bettered by Federer. He also won 14 majors before retiring at the age of 33. If he had continued playing for a few more years, he could easily have increased his tally. Overall, Sampras won 64 singles titles in his career including 11 ATP Masters titles and dominated an era comprising of fellow greats like Agassi, Becker, Edberg and Courier. The only blot in Sampras superb career was the inability to win a French Open title. Sampras also spent a total of 286 weeks as the worlds no.1 tennis player and only Roger Federer has eclipsed that feat.
Sampras, however, proved the completeness of his game by winning 5 US Open and 2 Australian Open titles. He also had the greatest serve of all time. Sampras was a brilliant volleyer too and was the last true great exponent of the serve-and-volley game. His cross-court passing shots were a treat to watch and so were his backhand slices.
He also had a single-minded and unflinching focus on the court and always raised his game in the big matches. He remained a fierce competitor throughout his career and was a champion to the core.
3. NOVAK DJOKOVIC (SERBIA)
Djokovic is quite possibly the greatest hard-court player of all time. He has won 10 majors on hard-courts, a feat bettered only by Roger Federer. However, one has to keep in mind that Djokovics career started well after Federers and therefore, the former has a better winning ratio. He has also managed to win nearly 85% of his career matches and even Federer has an inferior overall winning ratio. In all, Djokovic has won 13 Grand Slams till date and this number could easily go up further. He also has the unique record of holding all the Grand Slam titles at once.
Djokovics game is built upon solid baseline play and he also has the best groundstrokes of all time. His court coverage is absolutely superb too and he almost always manages to reach the ball with his magnificent slides. Djokovic, however, does not boast of a great serve and it explains his relatively inferior record on grass.
The fact that he has still managed to win 2 Wimbledon titles speaks volumes of the other facets of his game. Overall, Djokovic has won 70 career singles titles including 31 ATP Masters titles.
2. RAFAEL NADAL (SPAIN)
The King of Clay holds an unsurpassable record of 11 French Open titles. His dominance at Roland Garros is almost ridiculously evident. However, the fact that he has managed to win 6 more majors on other surfaces goes on to show the completeness of his game.
Nadal has won 5 majors on hard-courts and two Wimbledon titles on grass, his least favored surface. He has managed to win 80 career singles titles including 33 ATP Masters titles and is still among the best in the world at the age of 32. He also won the Olympic singles gold medal in 2008.
Nadals court-coverage and incredible passing shots are among the primary reasons behind his success. He also has one of the greatest forehands of all time and his forehands almost always contain vicious top-spin.
He has a great return of serve too. Nadals rivalry with Federer is the greatest in the history of tennis and he actually enjoys a superior head-to-head record against his great rival.
Nadal still might increase his amazing tally of 17 majors as he is still going strong.
1. ROGER FEDERER (SWITZERLAND)
Federer is quite possibly one of the greatest sportspersons of all time. His record of winning 20 Grand Slams is unlikely to be bettered ever.
The fact that he has won the last 3 of those titles after attaining the age of 35 further underlines his greatness. He is on the verge of completing 2 decades in the circuit and still remains one of the best players in the world at the age of 37.
Federer has won 8 Wimbledon, 6 Australian Open, 5 US Open and a single French Open title in his incomparable career. He spent a staggering 237 consecutive weeks as the no. 1 player in the world, another feat unlikely to be bettered. He has also won 98 overall career singles titles including 27 ATP Masters titles.
Federer has a superb serve, the greatest forehand of all time, a magnificent one-handed backhand and great volleys.
He is primarily a baseliner but has brilliant net-skills too. Nadal enjoys a better overall head-to-head record against him but Federer has had his great rivals number in the biggest of the matches.
Federers silken touch, amiable behavior and winning mentality have made him an unrivaled champion and he comfortably remains the greatest player to have wielded a tennis racquet.  sk

Fonseka takes STF Commandant to task
Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka railed against Police Special Task Force (STF) Commandant Senior DIG M.R.Latheef making a controversial statement in Parliament yesterday.
The minister used the time allocated to him in the Parliamentary debate to speak on the recent arrests of his political supporters, trying hard to convince that those arrests were made based on fabricated and false evidence.
The irate minister heaped a series of accusations on Latheef as well as several other STF officers even naming them.
He allegedly linked Latheefs brother-in-law to the Cocaine consignment discovered from the Orugodawatte Container yard in 2016.
The Field Marshal also requested a special investigation on the incident where an underworld figure known as D. Manju was killed during a shootout with the STF in Wattala in February.
He referred to him as a Bull in the China Shop.
The minister said the Police Commission has given too much freedom to Police and that freedom is being misused by some Police officers. He also said corruption is still rampant in the public sector.
At the end of Fonsekas speech, MP Wimal Weerawansa observed that the information revealed by Fonseka, if found to be true, are serious in nature, and if those are untrue those officials named by Fonseka will be heavy inconvenienced.
The minister in reply said that he had already presented those details to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and that the PM requested a report from him over those matters. I am now preparing that report and the PM agreed to refer it to the CID for an investigation, he said.
Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara agreeing that Fonsekas statement was controversial, said Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and himself had already paid attention to it. He said those matters would be referred to the State Intelligence Unit (SIU) for an independent investigation. He however said the STF has been rendering a commendable service, but added that there could be a few who behaved in an unacceptable manner.
He observed that he was not in a position to comment as to who is correct and who is wrong as he is yet to receive official information.

Horse racing - Johnston breaks all-time British training record
LONDON, Thursday - Mark Johnston became the most prolific winning trainer in the history of British horse racing on Thursday when he saddled his 4,194th victorious runner at York.
Poets Society, a 20-1 outsider ridden by one of Britains most celebrated jockeys Frankie Dettori, won a handicap chase to push the 58-year-old Scotsman Johnston past the mark of 4,193 set by Richard Hannon Snr. The Yorkshire-based Johnston, who trained his first winner 31 years ago and has earned more than 53 million pounds ($67.6 million) prize money, has not been one of the most garlanded trainers, nor overseen the most expensive thoroughbreds.
Yet he has earned untold respect for his production line of regular winners, which have featured British and Irish classic triumphs and numerous victories at the sports top meeting, Royal Ascot.
Its a relief. Its been a hard few days, said Johnston, who equalled the record on Saturday. I cant say I expected to do it with a 20-1 shot, but Frankie stepped up again here.
Johnston, a trained veterinarian who came into racing from the unlikely background of a Scottish council estate, started with three-and-a-half horses in his initial operation but has built a substantial stable in the English village of Middleham.
He has trained more than 100 British winners for 25 consecutive seasons and has saddled winners at every flat racing course in Britain. The British trainers title is based on most prize money but if it was decided on number of winners, Johnston would have won it 11 times.
