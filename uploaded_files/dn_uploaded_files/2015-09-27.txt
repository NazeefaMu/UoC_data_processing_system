Darling tweet!
A Young Queen Elizabeth, Prince Philip and Prince Charles (in a Scottish Kilt!) Get Cozy on a Blanket at Balmoral!:
Buckingham Palace threw it back to 1960 on Thursday  with a dash of plaid for good measure. The palace gave a rare glimpse of the royal family in complete casual mode at Balmoral Castle in a tweet last Thursday. In the sweet photo from 1960, Prince Charles, then 11, Princess Anne, then 10, and a baby Prince Andrew cuddle up on a plaid blanket on the yard of Balmoral Castle with their mom Queen Elizabeth, then 34, and dad Prince Philip, then 39.
The young royals look picture perfect in the darling photo  complete with the family pup! Queen Elizabeth is pictured doting on young Andrew, while a proud Prince Philip looks on. And siblings Charles and Anne fit right in with their Scottish surroundings in matching kilts.

The Queen retreats to her Scottish estate every summer for her annual two-month holiday in Aberdeenshire. She has been spending summers in the Scottish highlands ever since she was a young princess visiting the grand estate with her parents King George VI and Queen Elizabeth I. She and Prince Philip continued to make memories there with their own four children (and of course, the Queen's beloved corgis!).
The picturesque castle, which sits on 50,000 acres, has been in the royal family since 1852, when the estate was purchased by Prince Albert for his wife, Queen Victoria. The royal Scottish retreat is also special to Prince William and Princess Kate. During college, Will would whisk Kate away for romantic weekends to Tam-na-Ghar, the three-bedroom cottage on the castle grounds given to him by his grandmother.

A.B.A.C. Jiffrey :
He was ready to help others
Even today after 13 years since A.B.A.C. Jiffrey's demise, his existence is felt for many things he did.
At a time like this, a person of his calibre is highly needed to society.
Jiffrey improved his writing skills when he was a student at Zahira College, Colombo where he contributed many articles to the college magazine. He used to proudly mention that he was a student of the Dr. T.B. Jayah era.
Jiffrey was a prominent writer who had unique writing skills. He contributed to many leading newspapers, locally and internationally.
He was inspired by his maternal uncle A.I.L. Marikar who wrote several books. A.I.L Marikar's ancestry can be traced to Prince Jalaludeen of Armania. His father was A.B.L.I.L Marikar, the first reputed Ceylon Moor English book seller in Sri Lanka.
Jiffrey served as a member of the Board of Trustees of the Maradana Mosque, Colombo and was its Managing trustee till his demise. He was a very active member of the Moors Islamic Cultural Home since school days and was later appointed a Board member and held the position of several departmental committees as the chairman.
He was a long standing member of the All Ceylon Moors' Association and was also the Vice President. He also functioned as the Honorary Secretary of the International Islamic Institute.
Jiffrey was a simple and humble man who was always eager to help others through words of encouragement and advice. He is still remembered well for his kind heart and good deeds he did silently.

Hewa Nancy Fernando:
A gentle person with great sense of humour
September 25 marked the first death anniversary of Hewa Nancy Fernando of Wattala, former Vice Principal of Presbyterian Girls School, Colombo 8.
She was a practicing Buddhist and I remember her as a teacher who had a deep understanding of her religion. She was a vegetarian who despite a busy domestic schedule did not fail to meditate at least an hour everyday.
Nancy hailed from a reputed family. Retired Post Master H.E. Weeraratne was her father. She was the fourth in a family of six, three older brothers and two younger sisters.
She was educated at Ananda Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo 10 and passed the Senior School Certificate Examination in 1933. She started life as a teacher in 1935 at St. Mathew's College Dematagoda.
In 1945 she married Sonny Fernando, who was employed at the Cooperative Wholesale Establishment. They were blessed with three children Kamanitha, Kokilanee and Ananda who received the best of education, are now happily married and well placed in life.
Nancy was a very kind and gentle person of very high integrity with a great sense of humour. She was eloquent in both Sinhala and English. She was equally at ease with the rich as well as the poor. As a friend she reached out to help anybody who was in need.
She retired from the teaching profession in 1977 after serving for 42 years. The last post she held was that of Vice Principal of Presbyterian Girls School, Colombo 8.
Sri Dharmawickramaramaya, Meegahawatte, Peliyagoda was her second home. The temple lacked facilities as a result of which the resident monks faced hardships. She planned to develop the Viharaya and Dharmashalawa with fans, and a fully equipped washroom with pipe borne water. These improvements were carried out utilising her pension, without donations from others.
Her children have planned to erect a belfry in the temple premises in memory of their mother. It will be offered to the Sangha in due course.
May her sojourn in Samsara be brief and may she reach the supreme bliss of Nirvana!

Celebrating the achievements of the Oppressed
At the end of the report on Lanka in the section named Conclusions and Recommendations UNHR Commissioner states OHCHR investigation contained in this report was born out of the past failure of the Government of Sri Lanka to address accountability for the most serious human rights violations and crimes. Ending the impunity enjoyed by the security forces and associated paramilitary groups, as well as holding to account surviving members of the LTTE, will require political will and concerted efforts to ensure the non-recurrence of these violations and crimes.
Clearly he is speaking about the past of Lanka when country was submerged within a fascistic matrix where rule of law was violated. Certainly it was a period where all democratic forces were repressed with white vans and state terror in general.
Those who stood for a solution based on equality, autonomy and the right of self-determination, were mercilessly hunted down.
Media was suppressed and many media people were killed; some in broad day light. Military power handled by fascistic elements was ruling many areas. All that happened in the past. That we could agree, but then Prince Hussein says, The new Governments commitments in this respect are welcome, but it needs to convince a very skeptical audience  Sri Lankan and international  that it is determined to show results. Prosecuting a few emblematic cases will not be sufficient; Sri Lanka needs to address the patterns of serious human rights violations and other international crimes that have caused such suffering for all communities over decades if it is to prevent them haunting its future. We certainly agree to that observation while reminding that the new government came into power only a week ago.
January 8 victory
January 8 victory only started the change; that was just the beginning. There was a dual power situation with the Parliament dominated by fascistic elements. Though there was a semblance of majority with Maithri taking over the leadership of the SLFP, Mahinda group was able to arrest the programme of the interim government. Even the budget proposals were not implemented; hindrance appeared every where. The truth was Mahinda had an underground government through a network, with the support of loyal Buddhist temples and other centres. This latent fascistic power claimed to represent the wishes of 5.8 million voters and intimidated officials, professionals and other influential citizens. Only after the parliamentary elections their power network collapsed and new government could asset itself. Therefore the High Commissioner cannot look for results now; because the government is only two weeks old!
Anti-racist democratic revolution
The report then says The High Commissioner remains convinced that for accountability to be achieved in Sri Lanka, it will require more than a domestic mechanism. Sri Lanka should draw on the lessons learnt and good practices of other countries that have succeeded with hybrid special courts, integrating international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators. Such a mechanism will be essential to give confidence to all Sri Lankans, in particular the victims, in the independence and impartiality of the process, particularly given the politicization and highly polarized environment in Sri Lanka. OHCHR stands ready to continue providing its advice and technical assistance in the design of such a mechanism. Clearly this suggestion is premature.
People in Lanka were locked in a battle with a fascistic organization that had genocidal aims and cruel racist attitudes. Struggle came into open in January 8. Though substantial victory is achieved by august 17 struggle is continuing. Commissioner has failed to recognize the anti-racist democratic revolution that is taking place. Also he has missed the steps taken to go beyond prosecuting a few emblematic cases and preparations to address the patterns of serious human rights violations. Furthermore, he has missed the solutions in preparation to the Tamil national problem. Latter led to international crimes that have caused such suffering for all communities over decades.
The masses that came out to defeat and overthrow the fascistic regime accused of genocidal mania and inhuman repression, are still active. All over the country, including Tamil speaking areas, people are prepared to come out and show their opposition to such actions.
Provincial Councils are functioning that includes such councils in Tamil speaking areas. Recently leader of the Tamil National Alliance and the Federal party R. Sampanthan became the Leader of Opposition defeating the conspiracy hatched by the fascistic elements.
International community must recognize these achievements of the poor oppressed people of Lanka.

Chinese Communist Party praises govts anti-corruption drive
The Chinese Communist Party praised Sri Lankas new governments drive against corruption and expressed its willingness to help in this process.
Chinese Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China, Chen Fengxiang made these remarks when he met with a Sri Lankan delegation headed by Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti.
On the request of Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti, Chinese authorities agreed to provide specialized training to Lankan officials engaged in anti corruption investigations.
The Sri Lankan delegation expressed their satisfaction over the anti corruption drive initiated by Chinese President Xi Jinping and both were engaged in a lengthy conversation about this programme.
Chinese Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China, Chen Feng Xiang paid his gratitude to UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for maintaining a close and cordial relationship with the Chinese Communist Party for a long time and stressed the importance of further enhancing the ties.
The fact that Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang was among the first to congratulate Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe after he became Prime Minister by winning the General election, shows the respect and friendship that the Chinese government accords to the Prime Minister. He said that China considers the UNP as one of the leading forces in Sri Lankan politics.
During talks, Additional Secretary Athaudahetti said China and Sri Lanka entered in to their first bilateral agreement, the Sino- Lanka Agreement on Rubber-Rice exports in 1952 during the UNP regime, while formal diplomatic relations between the two countries were established in 1957 during the SLFP regime. The UNP and SLFP have had close links with China despite external influences and pressures. Hence, a situation will be created for an even better relationship with China through a combined UNP, SLFP Government.

Did ordinary Sri Lankan voter get an uncooked deal
The Parliament of Singapore sometime back passed a bill to abolish the Parliamentary Pensions Act after a review of ministerial salaries which recommended that the pension scheme be scrapped for office holders such as Ministers, Deputy Ministers and Members of Parliament since it had become necessary to fall in line with the principle of having a transparent, open wage system, where there are no hidden perks for politicians and politicians alone.
Unlike Parliamentarians in Sri Lanka, the politicians who supported this bill had said that they being politicians  they are not employees or holding employment as a career. MP Christopher de Souza in Parliament said: I believe most, if not all, of us present at todays debate would agree with me that political office is both a calling (and a passion). He added Those who want to serve must have the sense of duty and beyond that passion to the nation, as well as a desire to contribute to the public good of Singapore. It is even more surprising, unlike in Sri Lanka, he had elaborated  For MPs, we are in this because we believe in the ethos of sacrifice that public service entails, listening to them, caring for them, offering encouragement in times of difficulty and mapping out real ways of progress for them and their children  that is fulfilling, that is politics. Let me also quote how he had ended the debate  Those who want to serve must have that sense of duty and, beyond that, passion to the Nation, as well as a desire to contribute to the public good of Singapore. Do you think whether we could now develop politicians of this calibre in the present Parliament
Singaporean Parliament
Now that the approval to abolish the Parliamentary Pensions Act has been granted by the Singaporean Parliament, those elected after the 21st May, 2011 will not receive any pension. Those who had been elected prior to May 21st will have their pensions frozen and be eligible only for pensions accrued upto 20 May 2011.
In another move separately, the Parliament had also passed an alternative amendment to pave the way for the pensions scheme to be scrapped for former Presidents as well. It is even more surprising to learn that none of the Presidents so far have enjoyed this facility though there had been approved provisions legally to draw a pension after they relinquish office as the President. Could this ever happen in Sri Lanka  a banana republic
I also wish to quote what the then Minister of Finance had stated in Parliament when the Parliamentary Pensions Bill was taken up on 11th June, 1969: [to provide] for pensions who render public service such as Members of Parliament in their latter years [when] they have devoted a considerable portion of their working lives to such service.  We cannot expect to get future leaders of the calibre on the cheap..Singaporeans.. Must not believe they continue to expect men of ability in future to suffer severe financial sacrifices in pursuit of a hazardous political career..
JRJ government large-heartedly enacted the Parliamentary Pensions Act No. 1 of 1977 to pay a pension to ex-parliamentarians and thereby provided to include allowances currently paid to public officers on their pensions, after a period of five years, which in fact is eight years (after two terms) in Singapore. It must also be pointed out that this a non-contributory unique pension scheme. The average public servant contributes monthly for many decades and becomes eligible to draw a monthly pension at retirement only. The law has also provided the former MPs drawing parliamentary pensions to automatically get their increase when the sitting MPs get a salary increase. This is a serious injustice and such discriminatory laws are not found elsewhere, except in Sri Lanka.
There have also been peculiar instances where a lump sum had been paid to those who do not qualify for the parliamentary pensions when the law does not provide particularly for such payments. I must point out when a dispute arose in regard to the payment of pension of the late Anuruddha Ratwatte, the former Cabinet of Ministers approved a similar lump sum, since there was a question who becomes entitled for the pension under the law.
Spending tax payers money
Nevertheless, British Parliament too, have now introduced new laws for the greater benefit of the countrymen and to save public money, with a view to more actively inform their constituents of how they are spending tax payers money on parliamentary and constituency work. British Parliament has taken a giant leap forward and introduced  The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority  IPSA, in 2009, in the aftermath of what has come to be known as the EXPENSES SCANDAL and one of the duties of IPSA is to set MPs pay. This no doubt was a total deviation from the past practice. For the first time in UK, an independent body considered and determined how MPs should be paid in future. Accordingly, the newly introduced pay structure was to take effect from the start of the new Parliament with effect from May 2015. It must also be mentioned that MPs no longer will be responsible for setting their own pay in the UK  serving themselves with a larger spoon.
These crucial changes have been made despite the fact that MPs controlled their own pay for centuries. It has also been reported that MPs had held their pay at a lower level and continued to draw allowances and expenses that were less visible to the general public. This had, however, culminated in the EXPENSES SCANDAL of 2009 which did so much damage to the Parliament and to the confidence in MPs.
After the establishment of IPSA in 2010, it is now slowly but steadily helping to re-establish the respect, the recognition and confidence of the parliamentarians in the citizens particularly because IPSA carries out its duties when it takes up issues of MPs pay independently and transparently.
IPSA also introduced a proposal that MPs should more actively inform their constituents of how they are spending taxpayers money on parliamentary and constituency work. Based on a research done in England, it has also been found that, as public understanding of the role of an MP increases, it is more likely that the public too will believe and approve that MPs deserve a professional level of salary. IPSAs scheme has become an international standard for how politicians be supported fairly transparently and independently from the public purse. IPSA has taken steps also to remove MPs ability claim for expenses that may appear to have an element of personal benefit. MPs now cannot claim for hospitality, evening meals, taxis home when working late (unless the House sits after 11.00 p.m.), home contents insurance, and a variety of other expenses.
Let me keep the general public informed, if we are to clean up our system, we may also have to do drastic changes including stopping decentralized budget allocations given to MPs, which is claimed to be wasteful and utterly corrupt. We need to follow the steps taken by British and Singaporean Parliament to restore the good name of our legislators.
British Parliamentarians were first paid a salary in 1911 and in Sri Lanka until 1970s our parliamentarians were paid a meagre allowance only. They were given railway warrants and CTB passes and this whole system was changed stating security reasons after the country was dragged in to a war with the LTTE. The question of providing security men and back up vehicles costing billions to the government became an unbearable burden to our depleting resources and the stagnant economy. In addition, issue of tax free vehicle permits etc. have caused irreversible issues to the country, and the economy which needs to be carefully evaluated and re-designed. IPSA in their latest report has stated: We found no evidence that the level of pay had a direct impact on candidates putting themselves forward for election to Parliament, or on MPs continuing to serve. Nonetheless we must not set a level of pay that is either so high that it encourages people to stand for Parliament for the money, or so low that people may from many professions are unduly deterred from standing.
Social security benefits
In Singapore, they pay MPs extremely well as in the case of other public servants. The Sub Committee on Members Remuneration and Operation Expenses had directed the Research and Library Services Division in Singaporean Parliament to conduct a research into overseas practice regarding pension arrangement for legislators and they had finally scrapped their pension.
Another significant feature in Singapore is that after the scrapping of the pension scheme all MPs contribute to the Central Provident Fund (CPF), as in the case of all other citizens which had been established in Singapore in 1955 by an Act of Parliament. The MPs too accordingly become entitled to enjoy equivalent social security benefits, financial security benefits as in the case of all other citizens without any discrimination, whether you are a MP or an ordinary citizen. The CPF Act also provides a special interest rate to its CPF members at their retirement when they are no longer able to work to maintain a decent living standard.
We must also tell the rulers to adopt similar methods to treat all citizens (including MPs) alike without discrimination. In Singapore the Minimum Sum will provide MPs with a regular income after retirement. At present, the minimum sum is S$65,000/= [HK$ 292,000/=]. MPs have three options to invest their minimum sum: (a) buy a life annuity from an approved insurance company (b) keep it with an approved bank; or (c) leave it with the CPF Board.
If a MP buys life annuity, he will get a monthly income for life. If he leaves the money with an approved bank or the CPF Board, he will get a monthly income until his minimum sum is exhausted. Monthly income from the minimum sum is tax free.
Let us now commit ourselves to strive together for a more inclusive, truly democratic republic with equal rights and opportunities to secure a safe and peaceful future for us all.
Our rulers must remember I quote: Democracy is an objective. Democratization is a process. Democratization serves the cause of peace because it offers the possibility of justice, equality and of progressive change without force  Boutros Boutros Ghali

Don Ladylike Dresses to Meet Pope Francis
What do you wear to meet the Pope If youre one of the Obama ladies, ladylike perfection, of course!
Clad in pastel hued and A-line silhouettes, Michelle Obama and her daughters, Malia and Sasha, stood on the tarmac when Pope Francis landed in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday September 22, for the first stop on his US tour.
Always one to gravitate towards color (and wear it beautifully), the FLOTUS, 51, modeled a mint-hued Carolina Herrera cowl-neck dress, cinched at the waist with a matching skinny belt. Pointed-toe heels in a metallic hue completed her ensemble.
And her little ladies looked no less chic! Malia, 17, who recently completed an internship on the set of HBOs Girls, worked a black and white dress with a floral skirt, teamed with sky-blue Mary Janes.
Her younger sister, Sasha, 14, chose a black top with pleated cap sleeves, paired with a color-blocked Kate Spade skirt and ballerina flats. Of course, the Obama ladies were joined by the president, Barack Obama, who looked dapper in a navy-blue suit, a white button-up, a cornflower-blue tie, and lace-up shoes. The next day, the President and the First Lady joined Pope Francis on the balcony of the White House, during an arrival ceremony honoring the Pope. For that occasion, Michelle slipped into a navy Monique Lhuillier dress with a floral lace bodice.
Saluting the Popes commitment to environmental preservation, President Obama said at the ceremony, Holy Father, you remind us that we have a sacred obligation to protect our planetGods magnificent gift to us. We support your call to all world leaders to support the communities most vulnerable to a changing climate and to come together to preserve our precious world for future generations. Washington, D.C. is just the first stop on Pope Francis tour of the US. His Holiness will also visit NYC from Thursday to Saturday, at which time hell meet with the UN, lead a procession through Central Park, and hold a mass at Madison Square Garden.
Hell then depart for Philadelphia, where hell see Independence Mall and hold a prayer vigil during the Festival of Families, to name just a few of the activities on his busy schedule.

It is the new face of the 21st century and will continue to be a domineering presence in this world for years to come. Young people can easily access Facebook anywhere. In fact most children look forward to using Facebook more than looking forward to the second coming of Christ. Well we may not know that but what we do know is that it is a very popular form of social media. Daily News spoke to a cross section of the public to find what they think of Facebook.
It is just face value!
Rozanne Diasz Leanage, Beauty Queen, Trainer and Career Guidance Consultant and Model shared her views on Facebook with the Daily News saying that most of the posts on Facebook are contagious and addictive.
"All the advice given does not seem realistic. It is just face value. That's why it's called Facebook. It will not show what is inside of you but the outer look. Anything to do with gaining knowledge interests me. It could be about any subject. Funny stuff also amuse me also a bit of gossip which I miss out in real life and the newspapers.
There are also positive and negative features. But I do enjoy the privacy of those days too. Also there is the fact that if you don't reply people, they know you have read the message so it will look too rude if you ignore it. I use it a lot for work purpose. I do deactivate for some times and take a breather. It is influential and productive as long as you know your limits. It has a huge impact. Yes it can change the image or an idea or a perspective of some things. It has a voice! But comments and statuses should not be taken too seriously in my opinion."
No time for Facebook!
Ramani Fernando Hairstylist, says she hardly has the time to 'peep' regularly into Facebook, but enjoys seeing others happy and sees no reason to be judgmental "Posts that catch my attention are anything interesting and hearing from a long lost friend or relation. But what I despise about Facebook is character assassination. I don't think Facebook has changed my life too much since I am not addicted to it but it certainly keeps one updated. I could do without Facebook in this day and age but I certainly enjoy anything interesting whether in the newspapers, magazines, television, radio and Facebook.
Facebook is no different to any other media. There is the useful stuff and the trash. The choice is yours. But Social life to me has very little to do with Facebook. Personally I have not experienced Facebook enough to comment on whether it is changing a small part of the world we live in, but I would believe that it would have an impact on those who spend a lot of time on it and being obsessed with it."
A virtual country!
Kumar de Silva, fame of Bonsoir too commented and described Facebook as a virtual country!
"Facebook is a virtual country and it is both a very amusing and equally very dangerous place to live in. It's all about networking and that's where the catch lies - networking how and to what degree - that's where it can become narcissistic and addictive and abusive.
Since FB is a virtual country with millions of people, not everything is really authentic. A lot of "tinkering" is possible thus giving the imagination free reign with flexibility. Facebook is all about a "virtual face" and that says it all doesn't it
FB to me is a "marketing tool". I make statements. I share posts. I upload images - all of which I think would be of interest to my FB friends. On the other hand the posts that primarily catch my attention are the more socially conscious ones. Having said that, I must say that it also enables me to keep in touch with school mates, university batch mates, and other friends and colleagues
But what I despise about Facebook are posts that are boastful. That's what sickens me. But then to each his own. In the past I managed brilliantly well without FB. It is just that it took a bit more time to reach a person. But like a pager, telephone, fax machine, mobile phone, FB is now a means of communication, and an instant one at that.
Advice given on Facebook depends from whom and where it comes. There is a lot of stalking in FB land so one needs to be very cautious. There are times when I actually de-activate my FB account and take a break from it. It's like leaving FB country and going away on holiday and being away from it. And then I have people phoning and texting me asking - 'what happened' - some genuinely and some others not."
Platform for social change
Vraie Balthazaar - TV personality & Compere felt that people paint the picture of how they want to be portrayed, on FB. Not all of it is necessarily real or true-but some of it is.
"FB is a platform for social change. There are lots of people who use FB not just to talk about what they ate, or wore, or who they hung out with-they also talk about things that are socially relevant. And it helps bring about change. Those are the posts I like to read. That being said, of course I like seeing friends I haven't seen in ten years, and re-connecting with family that don't live here in SL.
Everyone seems to be a hero on FB. Few people do much, besides putting up a post. I sometime wish people lived beyond their posts and did more. FB is an effective tool to bring about positive change. But it is also a scary place where people can spread hatred. There is a lot of racism and sexism on FB. It's frightening and the reason I was off it for over 2 years.
I was off for more than 2 and a half years, till I got back on about a month ago. I didn't really miss it to be honest. The only people who knew what was happening in my life, were those who were the closest to me. I travelled, ate amazing food, and had great times with friends and family."
Quoting Baz Luhrmann who said "be careful whose advice you buy, but be patient with those who supply it". Vraie feels that everyone is entitled to an opinion because many people mean well and advice is dispensed freely.
"I had a fairly negative experience on FB. And at the time, I wasn't happy to talk about it. Now, two and a half years on, I think I don't see FB in the same light as I did back then. I also learnt a few lessons on how unsafe FB can be. I realized that the system in SL, is ill equipped to deal with FB related issues and threats. There is absolutely nothing done, even when the correct steps are taken, to file a report of FB abuse. The system totally fails you. It's pretty horrific.
It is a great platform for social change. I think the purpose is to open people's minds and facilitate discussions. FB is also a great way to promote businesses too-so many entrepreneurs are now making a name for themselves."
Attention seekers!
Akhry Ameer - Freelance Multi-Skilled Professional feels that endless posting indicates that they are 'attention seeking' or 'they have nothing better to do' when they keep posting endlessly of nearly every-single activity they do.
"The posts that only catch my attention are when it is different from the day-to-day activity of socializing. I also enjoy reading shares of some news or human interest stories, but then again some of them are hoax or false posts.
For me, Facebook is my electronic diary and most of my posts are private. However, it is a very important contact tool in that, people may change telephone numbers, countries, jobs but you can reach them on Facebook. I am not that much of an ardent user, so yes I can certainly picture myself without it."
Akhry concedes that though not all posts are useful but some people do post some very interesting news, thoughts and perspectives which tends to broaden your thinking.
"So it depends, we must have the proper sense of mind to determine how useful the information can be. Today most people don't have time and have succumbed to the pressures of the modern world. I don't necessarily socialize on Facebook, but I find private messaging useful as you can carry on a conversation in bits and pieces over several days according to each others availability, especially with friends overseas."

Federal judge rules Happy Birthday song in public domain
US: The music publishing company that has been collecting royalties on the song Happy Birthday To You for years does not hold a valid copyright on the lyrics to the tune that is one of the mostly widely sung in the world, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.
U.S. District Judge George H. King determined the song's original copyright, obtained by the Clayton F. Summy Co. from the song's writers, only covered specific piano arrangements of the song and not its lyrics. The basic tune of the song, derived from another popular children's song, Good Morning to All, has long been in the public domain. King's decision comes in a lawsuit filed two years ago by Good Morning To You Productions Corp., which is working on a documentary film tentatively titled Happy Birthday.
The company challenged the copyright now held by Warner/Chappell Music Inc., arguing that the song should be dedicated to public use and in the public domain.
Because Summy Co. never acquired the rights to the Happy Birthday lyrics, defendants, as Summy Co.'s purported successors-in-interest, do not own a valid copyright in the Happy Birthday lyrics, King concluded in his 43-page ruling.
The lawsuit also asked for monetary damages and restitution of more than $5 million in licensing fees it said in 2013 that Warner/Chappell had collected from thousands of people and groups who've paid to use the song over the years.
Marshall Lamm, a spokesman for one of the plaintiffs lawyers, said that issue would be determined later.
In the meantime, one of the suit's co-plaintiffs, Ruypa Marya of the music group Ruypa & The April Fishes, praised Tuesday's decision.
I hope we can start reimagining copyright law to do what it's supposed to do  protect the creations of people who make stuff so that we can continue to make more stuff, said Marya, who added she paid Warner/Chappell $455 to include Happy Birthday To You on a live album during which members of her band and audience sang the song to her the night before her birthday. Warner/Chappell has said it doesn't try to collect royalties from just anyone singing the song but those who use it in a commercial enterprise. We are looking at the court's lengthy opinion and considering our options, Warner/Chappell said in a statement following Tuesday's ruling.
In his ruling King went into great detail about the history of Happy Birthday To You and its derivation from Good Morning to All.

Garcias try gives Italy victory over Canada
Canadas fly half Nathan Hirayama (on right) is tackled by Italys lock Josh Furno during a Pool D match of the 2015 Rugby World Cup between Italy and Canada at Elland Road in Leeds, north England, on September 26, 2015. AFP
Gonzalo Garcia scored Italys 50th World Cup try to help his country secure a narrow but vital 23-18 victory over Canada in a riveting encounter on Saturday.
The result was cruel for the Canadians who lost a similarly tight duel with the same opponents 19-14 in the 2003 World Cup. They dominated for long periods and scored the try of the tournament so far through DTH van der Merwe.
Italys win after a heavy defeat to France in their opener gives them a boost eight days from an intimidating encounter with Six Nations champions Ireland.
Canadas sole consolation was a defensive bonus point. Nathan Hirayama gave Canada a deserved lead in the 15th minute with a penalty after the Canadians had threatened the Italian tryline on several occasions in the opening salvoes. A minute later Canada scored the try of the tournament so far, started and finished by van der Merwe, who broke from deep inside his own half down the left wing and passed to Ciaran Heard.
Heard sucked in his man and passed back to the onrushing van der Merwe, who had come inside and easily danced round the remaining Italian defender to touch down under the posts.

Hirayama converted for 10-0.
The jolt had the desired effect on a somnolent and indolent Italy, who struck back immediately prompted by a superb solo run from scrum-half Edoardo Gori.
He outfoxed John Moonlight and quickly put dayling between himself and the lumbering back row forward before being brought to ground. The chance was not lost as Michele Rizzo went over once the ball had been worked back.
Tommaso Allan converted for 10-7 and the former Scotland Under-20 international -- who opted for the land of his mothers birth for senior Test rugby -- levelled affairs in the 25th minute with a penalty. Allan had to go off shortly afterwards for a head injury assessment and replaced by Carlo Canna, who put Italy ahead on the stroke of half-time as he converted a penalty for a 13-10 lead.

Investors are mining for water, the next hot commodity
US: Gazing out of a turboprop high above his company's main asset - 34,000 acres in the Mojave Desert with billions of gallons of fresh water locked deep below the sagebrush-dotted land - Scott Slater paints a lush picture that has enticed a hardy band of investors for a quarter-century.
Yes, Slater admits, his company, Cadiz, has never earned a dime from water. And he freely concedes it will take at least another $200 million to dig dozens of wells, filter the water and then move it 43 miles across the desert through a new pipeline before thirsty Southern Californians can drink a drop. But tapping cash, as opposed to actual water, has never been a problem for Cadiz.
I think there's plenty of money out there, Slater said.
Real profits may be nearly as scarce as snow in the High Sierra, but Wall Street, as it is wont to do, smells profit as California endures its worst drought in decades.
Investing in the water industry is one of the great opportunities for the coming decades, said Matthew J. Diserio of Water Asset Management, a New York firm that is a major backer of Cadiz.
Water is the scarce resource that will define the 21st century, much like plentiful oil defined the last century. So far, though, this veritable Gold Rush has mostly turned up fool's gold. During the last decade, Cadiz has accrued $185 million in losses, and revenue from the lemon groves and vineyards it owns in the Mojave have added up to only a trickle: $7.1 million total since 2005.
To develop the project, the company burns through $10 million to $20 million annually, paying for a never-ending battle in courthouses and conference rooms across California to win make-or-break government permits and to cover the salaries of its 10 full-time employees. Cadiz has generated that money by borrowing and regularly issuing more shares, prompting skeptics to wonder if it will ever actually deliver any water, much less any profits.
It's a tough game, said John Dickerson, chief executive of Summit Global Management, a 20-year-old San Diego firm that invests in water infrastructure companies, local water suppliers and water rights, both in the United States and overseas. - NDTV

Lanka to pursue eco-sensitive civilization - President
Sri Lankan government fully supports the adopted Post-2015 Sustainable Development Agenda, Sustainable Development Goals and targets, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
I declare that the Government of Sri Lanka will act with the determination of a pioneer of eco-sensitive civilization emerging in the 21st century, the President said, addressing the United Nations Sustainable Development summit.
Sustainable development encapsulates the equilibrium between social and economic development and environmental protection. The Government of Sri Lanka anticipates achieving these goals fully by 2030, he added.
The President said Sri Lankas rich history, dating back beyond 2,500 years provided the country with the inspiration and strength in this endeavour.
We will also formulate a state policy on resource consumption based on the sustainable capacity of the environment, the President stressed.
The relevant policy framework would be implemented within an institutional structure based on the principles of good governance, he added.
We will strive to minimize risks of possible environmental hazards, President Sirisena said adding that the country would work towards the provision of basic needs of the people, progressive alleviation of poverty.
Sri Lanka will be fully committed to dealing with the thirteenth sustainable development goal relating to climate change. We will strive to minimize the risks of possible environmental hazards. I firmly believe that a proper study is required to ascertain how climate change aggravates Sri Lankas
contemporary development challenges such as poverty alleviation, food security, increasing ageing population and natural disasters, he added.
In conclusion, I wish to affirm that in the preparation of development policies for Sri Lanka as an aspiring upper middle income country, our special attention is focused on poverty alleviation, achieving food security, energy, education, minimising income disparity and urban development, the President further added.

Matale Thomians take Eric Hulangamuwa Shield
St. Thomas College, Matale, won the Eric Hulangamuwa Challenge shield when they beat St. Thomas College, Kount Lavinia by 2 goals to nil in their inaugural hockey big match organised jointly by the Old Thomians Hockey Union, Mount Lavinia and Matale Old Thomians Hockey Association and sponsored by Nations Trust Bank and played at Edward Park, Matale Before a large crowd on Saturday. At half time the Matale Thomians led 1-0.
Though the Matale Thomians known for their prowess in hockey held the home advantage of playing in familiar conditions they were given a fright by their counterparts from the school by the sea. They defended their territory stout heartedly compelling the Matale stickers to pull every trick from their bag to breach their defence. This was something which the Matale Thomians never bargained for.
From the beginning the game was played at a furious pace with play swinging from one end to the other though the Matale boys enjoyed a better share of possession but they could not crack the whip with ease.
It took 20 witness for the Matale Thomians to open their account when left flanker S. Wijetunga dribbled past two defenders and scooped the ball to centre forward Dinusha Madhusanka who scored with a well calculated drive.
The teams changed ends and on resumption the Mount Lavinia stickers displayed that they wee no push overs and showed the Thomian grit in style.
Eighteen minutes into the second half the Matale Thomians scored again and this time through centre forward Dinusha Madhusanka who enjoyed a good tame. If there was a Best Players award he would have been one of the top contenders for it.
Nadaraja Paraweetharan and Palitha Wasalege umpired
It was a good game of hockey played in the best spirits and the Mount Lavinia Thomians were never thrown into a whirlpool of despair as they gave back as much as they received and it was simply that their moves did not have the required finish and they did not have many opportunities to the scoring range of the semi circle. Eric Hulangamuwa Challenge Shield was handed over to the Matale Thomian Skipper by the Principal of St. Thomas College, Matale Dampiya Wanasinghe and Chaplian of St. Thomas College Mount Lavinia Rev.

Men, beware!
Prostate cancer has been detected as the ninth commonest cancer among Sri Lankan men. Worse still, the majority prostate cancer cases are diagnosed only during later stages. Consultant Oncologist of National Cancer Institute, Dr Prasad Abeysinghe explains what steps could be taken to deal with the cancer.
Q: What is Prostate cancer
A: The prostate is a gland found only in males. It sits below the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The glandular cells of prostate produce fluid that is added to the semen. The cancerous growths arising from these cells are commonly called prostate cancer. However there are other rare cancers that arise from prostate such as sarcomas. Early prostate cancer usually causes no symptoms.
The symptoms caused by prostate cancer are similar to those caused by benign enlargement of prostate. They are frequent urination, increased urination at night, difficulty of maintaining a steady stream of urine, blood in the urine and painful urination.
The examination by inserting a gloved finger into the rectum to feel the prostate gland enables a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. Ultrasound scans, CT, MRI and bone scans are used to confirm those abnormalities.
If cancer is suspected, a biopsy from the prostate via the rectum is obtained preferably with a biopsy gun. If cancer is present, the pathologist reports the grade of the tumor.
The grade suggests how fast the tumor is likely to grow. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test is also done. This value is also used to determine the risk of spread.
Q: Who are at risk and why
A: If you are above 65, and have a family history of prostate cancer, high consumption of red meat or high-fat dairy products, obesity, smoking and high exposure to toxic fumes, you are more prone to prostate cancer.
Q: What is the Sri Lankan situation of prostate cancer
A: Prostate cancer is the ninth commonest cancer among Sri Lankan men. The age adjusted rate of prostate cancer among men in Sri Lanka is 7.2/100,000.
Majority of prostate cancers in Sri Lanka are diagnosed at later stages.
Prostate cancer may be cured when localized, and it frequently responds to treatment even when it is widespread. The rate of tumor growth varies, and some patients may have a prolonged survival even after the cancer has spread to distant areas such as bone.
Q: What are the treatments available in Sri Lanka
A: The approach to treatment is influenced by age and coexisting medical problems. Side effects of various forms of treatment should be considered in selecting appropriate management.
Many patients, especially those with localized tumors, may die of other illnesses without ever having suffered disability from the cancer, even without an attempt at treatment.
Prostate cancer thrives on male androgen hormones.
For the majority of patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer towards later stages, androgen deprivation is the treatment. This can be achieved by undergoing a surgical removal of the testicles or by tri-month injections called GNRH and LHRH agonists which can be given underneath the skin for patients who wish not to have their testicles removed. However these injections are expensive in the long run.
There are other second line options such as chemotherapy injections and tablets for those who progress after androgen deprivation.
For patients who are diagnosed at early stages, there are several options. Those with low risk cancer can be closely monitored without treatment to avoid treatment-related side effects such as rectal toxicity, bladder toxicity and sexual impotence.
If there are signs of progression, they can be treated at that stage. Another approach is to wait until they give symptoms and treat at advanced stage. Those who get selected should be treated right away can either have surgical removal of the prostate or a course of radiotherapy with or without anti androgen treatment.
Most of the modern treatment modalities such as advanced external radiotherapy facilities are available in Sri Lanka at both government and private sector. These new techniques can minimize treatment-related toxicities.
Q: How could prostate cancer be prevented
A: Avoid the risk factors I have mentioned earlier. Safe sexual activity could be good for prostate health. High ejaculation frequency may possibly be associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer according to research.
Prostate cancer can often be found early by testing the amount of PSA in blood and rectal examination.
There is no question that screening can help detect many prostate cancers early. Men thinking about having prostate cancer screening should make informed decisions based on available information, discussion with their doctor, and their own views on the benefits and side effects of prostate cancer screening and treatment.

MR calls for removal of "hostile provisions" in UNHRC draft resolution
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement said that the draft resolution on Sri Lanka tabled before the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) has "hostile provisions" and called for the removal of them.
"If the government is going to accept this resolution and allow it to pass by consensus, then they should ensure that the hostile provisions are removed and the resolution is brought into line with the people's expectations', he added.
Highlighting operational paragraphs 1, 4, 6 and 8, Rajapaksa said they run contrary to the expectations that the government has generated among the people by claiming that the draft resolution has been 'watered down' in Sri Lanka's favour.
Rajapaksa said that when the resolution was under discussion, the Sri Lankan Ambassador in Geneva had formally requested the sponsors not to place primary emphasis on alleged war crimes issues and to change their approach in consideration for the new government of Sri Lanka."However, the sponsors of the resolution have not heeded that request" he added.

The myth we are trapped in
If only baby Seya Sedewmi was his daughter or even granddaughter and the boy of ten whose limbs were severed and beheaded was his son or grandson would this well meaning, now presumably Australian be preaching to us about Buddhism and Capital Punishment
Seya Sedewmi
He abhors the "willful taking of life", this is exactly what these monsters in human form have done, he goes on to say that "it has no place in civilized society and even more preposterous in a Buddhist nation that professes sanctity of all life...". What may we ask, the learned Professor, is the appropriate punishment for the willful taking of another's life which is what these monsters have done, they have willfully and cruelly taken the lives of two innocent children, (we have murders happening on almost a daily basis in our country today). Prof Ubesiri has apparently coined a new phrase "Judicial Murder"! I wonder how he would define 'civilized society' perhaps one that would allow murderers to lead happy lives at our expense in prisons even after they have taken the lives of others.
Peace and security
As for us being "a Buddhist Nation", that is no doubt an absolute myth--- for the teachings of the Buddha are not practiced; take for example the Karaneeya Metha Sutra in which the Buddha stated "JUST AS A MOTHER WOULD PROTECT HER ONLY CHILD EVEN AT THE RISK TO HER OWN LIFE, EVEN SO MAY WE HAVE BOUNDLESS LOVE AND COMPASSION FOR ALL BEINGS"; 'All beings' are described in the Suthra as follows: "long, short, thin, stout or medium, seen, unseen, born yet to be born, all beings without exception. May all beings be well and happy". The practice of these teachings of the Buddha goes by default. What a wonderful country ours would be only if we practice Buddhism.
Our Buddhism is not 'Prathipathithi Pooja' - (the practice of the teachings) but "Aamisa Pooja" ----or (the practice of rituals). There is no practice of Sila (morality) and Samadhi (Meditation, the control of the Mind) by all our people.
Today the two most important needs of our people are peace and security and it is the foremost duty of the State to ensure that for the people, so that we can build a truly civilized society, for our religions have failed us in their practice. We value the sanctity of life and we must therefore be protected from those who violate the sanctity of our lives.
Criminal justice system
As stated earlier since religions have failed to ensure their practice, and there is no love and compassion for all our fellow beings, 'Capital Punishment' is the only deterrent that would instill fear and shame and ensure peace and security for us all, but I must confess that it does raise many issues: cases drag on for years, and it is no deterrent if the punishment is carried out years after the offence was committed.
I recall a former AG stating that a case of rape of a fourteen-year-old girl had taken 20 years to be concluded and what he said was not an isolated instance --- yes our criminal justice system MUST be completely overhauled, let us in the first instance bring back the Administration of Justice Law which was introduced by the late Felix Dias Bandaranaike which was introduced to overhaul the system and cutout the delays, but had apparently been repealed at the instance of Lawyers who lived on 'Dates'!! Let us have separate courts to hear cases involving children (there is said to be over 260 cases of crimes against children) and women, let us speed up the system and make it meaningful to us all.

NATURES HOUR STRICTLY NO POLITICS!
Relieved from the honks of the polluting vehicles, congestion of the traffic and pungent smelling air replete with hazardous carbon pollutants the bus veered into the Parliament Road at Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte. As I am employed in the House that harbours the supremacy of the SriLankan political system, taking that route is a part of my quotidian journey to office.
Brushing aside the hullabaloo for which this precinct often falls on the headlines. The natural beauty cloaked around it is indeed a scrumptious delight to our senses which no one would dare to refute. Each morning is unique. Thats the ardent underpinning theory of nature. Each day is of its own with the awe striking beauty of the surrounding greenery. Each day vies for resplendence and sublimity against the previous day. Therefore each day is an inter display of colours that is afresh every morn.
The neatly asphalt laid Parliament Road is aligned on either sides with lush green Ironwood vegetation. Every tree serves a pallet of hues as that of a virtuoso artist. The withering leaves bear a buff colouration while the tender ones tinge a light green so do the newly sprouting foliage adorn with a cherry red or Apricot orange. Moreover on a wintry monsoon morn, the cold trees shroud around itself a quilt of teal blue wispy fog which bespeak of subtle chrome.
Even after 8 oclock when the sun warms up the earth energizing its inhabitants for the days chores, the wafting lethargic mist refuses to leave the sanctuary playing hide and seek against the combing rays of the apoplectic sun. The sun beams arduously penetrate every gap between the foliage and reeds in the bank of the Diyawanna to drive off the wisp. But the descending precipitation chills out the scorch of the sun by condensing the dew drops cozily perched on the cusps and trichomes of the leaves. Cool breeze flows around the sanctuary shaking off the rain.
The Blue lotuses in the reflection pond bobbles up and down as the heavy drops hit against their tender petals. A bunch of crows perched on frangipani trees drenched in the shower taking a monsoon bath. Tearing through the haze a surveillance boat catches my eyeball. It whizzes its way across the Diyawanna leaving a trail of a foamy wake. Cascading heavy rain drops drip down the decorative pair of metallic bells adorning the foyer. The drops droop around the rim of the bell lip resembling studded limpid pearls. As the wet road reflects the glowing headlights of the beetling vehicles, the sizzling droplets tickle on my face as my vehicle speedily heads to mark our attendance above the red line.
As the precipitation recedes the hibernating fauna comes to life. A giant monitor lizard with its kid waddles along the pastures of the green garden, wiggling its tail. They coyly scavenge along the place digging into the manicured garden much to the annoyance of the gardener. A skein of nidifugous lapwings scan the area for some forage. A group of stray dogs and proud cats coil themselves for warmth and emerge into deep slumber.
Along the causeway the buffeting white petalled flowers of the Ironwood tree fall on the black asphalt road forming a decorative polka dotted design, while the golden shower tree for its contribution cascades tiny yellow blossoms rolling out a plush yellow blanket. The ripples of the Diyawanna compose a water ballet of their own propagated by the scudding zephyr that blows across the water body. The grandeur of the performance is further elevated by the choppy droplets of the drizzle. Fluttering frolicsome butterflies and skittering dragonflies sing a libretto while they quench their thirsts with the nectar from the freshly bloomed blossoms.
By dusk the entire precinct adorns itself in its glittering finery. The subtle yellow gleam reflects on the brown walls of the edifice revealing a blend of illumination. Spherical lamp shades glow as gleaming buttons right around the territory. The birdies busily chatter about their days chores with all the usual hyperbole which we hardly could construe. Billowing clouds display shades of ash tinged with the golden splash of the dipping sun.
The full moon glares into its floating miniature reflection on the stark clear still water body. Yonder the snaking tarmac covered road seems busy with glimmering vehicles steering along the road like fluorescent fireflies beetling off. The national flag flaps in the breeze acknowledging the splendid beauty around. The lamp posts in front of the foyer resemble bunches of succulent golden berries glowing in the dark. It illuminates the faade of the Parliamentary building spreading a sheen of burnished copper.

As the amber lamp held high on the flag pole goes off depicting the conclusion of the days proceedings, my vehicle drives off its way fitting itself amidst in the clogged traffic. The Parliamentary building along with the national flag stands majestically alluring with arresting beauty etched against the backdrop of stupendous natural serenity.

Nearly 30,000 foreign fighters went to Syria and Iraq
US: US intelligence fears nearly 30,000 foreign fighters have traveled to Iraq and Syria since 2011, many of them to join the Islamic State group, The New York Times reported Saturday.
The number, which reportedly includes many westerners including perhaps 250 Americans, represents a doubling of last year's US assessment and will dismay US war planners.
The New York Times' report cites anonymous "intelligence and law enforcement officials."
In recent weeks, there have been allegations that the US military has been playing down the IS threat in intelligence reports, to paint a rosier picture of its efforts.
But US President Barack Obama will on Tuesday next week chair an international summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly for leaders fighting the IS group and "violent extremism." And on Tuesday, a US Congressional report into foreign fighter flows is expected to paint a bleaker picture, suggesting that a year of US-led air strikes has not slowed recruitment. - AFP

FR. JOE FERNANDO: PASSIONATE LIBERATOR OF THE POOR
Part one was published on September 14 :
The impact Fr. Joe Fernando has made in the field of socio-economic development, the integral growth of the poor and the efforts he has made for the establishment of a National Centre (SEDEC) cannot be fully understood without reference to his pioneering work in Negombo.
As an animator and enabler, he was able to achieve many good results for the uplift of the people, particularly of the socially marginalised, with the collaboration of a team of priests in the Negombo region. I had seen these priests coming to the presbytery (Mission House) at Sea Street practically every month to discuss matters relating to the lives of the people.
For 10 years (1958 -1968), the team led by Fr. Joe experimented and successfully carried pout some socio-pastoral programmes  catechetical, liturgical, youth apostolate, education, cooperatives, fisheries and community development.
It was the joint commitment of the priests led by Fr. Joe that was responsible for obtaining a Maha Vidyalaya (St. Peters Maha Vidyalaya) for Negombo. They were also able to promote youth apostolate among the rural young men and young women by establishing a Centre (Christu Nivasa) in Negombo.
The team was also able to persuade Sr. Good Counsel, the then Provincial Superior of the Good Shepherd Sisters, to start a Centre for life-education and training of the poor girls in Negombo and she responded by providing such a Centre at Hunupitiya.
It was Fr. Joes far-sighted vision that enabled him to invite the Salesians led by Fr. Henry Remery, S.D.B, by offering them about 12 acres belonging to the parish of Sea Street, Negombo at Ettukkal, with the consent of the fisher-community of the parish and the approval of Archbishop Thomas Cooray OMI, so that they could begin their service in Sri Lanka both to the Church and to the larger society, especially in the field of technical education of the youth including the ones of the parish of Sea Street.
The socio-pastoral praxis of the team of priests animated by Fr. Joe had repercussions in the other parishes of the Archdiocese. As a result the need for a Socio-pastoral Centre in Negombo became a strong felt need for better coordination and direction. But, Cardinal Thomas Cooray OMI, the then Archbishop of Colombo wanted Fr. Joes services extended to the entire Archdiocese.
However, the Catholic Bishops soon requested the Archbishop to extend the services of the Centre to their dioceses as well and make it a National Centre. It can be said that SEDEC, the social Economic development Centre, is a national organisation of the Catholic Church in Sri Lanka that had evolved from the grassroots. It is a Centre for the development of the poor.
Leader with a viable vision
Fr. Joe is a visionary, a social engineer, an educator, a strategist and a devoted priest leader of the common people. He studied current issues and discussed with others who could stimulate him for further reflection and action. He has faith in the people and in their ability to become masters of their destiny given the suitable possibilities and opportunities. He believed that every human being has intrinsic dignity and is a child of God having the capacity to love. For him, people are not mere objects but decisional beings capable of living in open-ended relationships. That is why, not willing to dish out social theories or pre-fabricated development models, he would go to the people, bring them together for exchange of ideas and experiences, motivate them and plan with them and lead in the right path. He has not been a do-gooder and a talker but one who identified himself with the neglected ones. He knew that the love and care shown to the poor was shown to Jesus Christ Himself really present in them.
In the Negombo region, he had to face fearlessly the challenges posed by fish Mudalalis (businessmen),the Marxists and vested interests and rescue the poor from oppressive forces and offer opportunities for better physical quality of life and human development.
International Recognition
When Fr. Joe retired from his directorship of SEDEC in 1980, recognizing his thinking patterns and his sensitivity to the sufferings and hopes of the poor, Vatican officials soon gave him an assignment at Caritas Internationalis in Rome.
His promotion to such an important office should be seen as a progressive step of his faithfulness to his ministry of making the poor feel loved, valued and esteemed. It was in 1979 that he was conferred an honorary doctorate by Coady International Institute of St. Francis Xavier University, Antigonish, Canada for his development work in Sri Lanka and in the previous year (1978) when he was named Vice-President of CIDSE, the International Body of Catholic Agencies, he became the first Asian and first Sri Lankan to hold that post.

Tips for a healthy indoor garden
01.Water your plants only when the potting mix feels dry to the touch - over watering is often the cause of indoor plant death. Check by pushing your finger into the soil; if it comes out without any trace of soil on it, start watering.
02. Water from the bottom
Water poured directly onto the soil may flood, or not reach the pot plants roots. Instead, water plants bottom up by standing them in a dish and filling the dish with water. Delicate plants such as fuchsias thrive on this method. For this method to work, all pots should have holes in the bottom through which the water is absorbed.
03. Keep away from drafts
If you dont want your plant to die of heat or cold, avoid placing it in draughty areas or near air-conditioning outlets.
04. Plants that need lots and lots of strong light might not flower or set fruit, but they may give you enough nice greenery and fragrance to make keeping them worthwhile.
05.Plants that send out large or abundant roots may grow into smaller specimens than they would outdoors.
06. An important warning: be careful not to use plants that later become invasive weeds. (good example is water hyacinth which was brought to our country as an ornamental plant
Looks like I need to find an aspidistra. Not simply because I am a diehard fan of George Orwell whose favourite plant was probably an aspidistra, but because a kind lady in a gardening forum on yahoo, told me to do so. She was giving me advice when I wrote about the death of Twiggy. Poor Twiggy was my snake plant who had been on my desk the past six months. A few weeks ago I noticed Twiggy looked unusually dry, so I gave her a bit of water. Then a bit more. Then one day she shriveled horribly and collapsed like a deflated balloon, onto my desk.
When I wrote about Twiggy's tragic death and wondered what to do on the net, this unknown lady wrote, saying, You probably over-watered it. Too much love - it's the houseplant owner's classic mistake. After neglecting them entirely, that is. She suggested I replace poor Twiggy with an aspidistra.
I don't know where I can find an aspidistra. When I asked Eranga Lakshith, the proprietor of The Garden, who has over twenty years experience in creating indoor gardens, he didn't know, either. (This could be because I didn't pronounce the word right and he heard it as Asterix). He had better suggestions. He said to try plants like, Livistona (fan palms), Dracaena Sanderiana (lucky bamboo), and Phalaenopsis (moth orchids).
No doubt they are godsends for the I wish I had more time! gardener, the I always forget to water the plants gardener, or simply the lazy gardener. But mostly, for those of us, who are all these things as well as being the I plant things indoors, gardener.
Surely, if we, city-dwellers, find ourselves yearning for some greenery in our surroundings, an indoor garden is the answer - either in the form of a court yard - (a mada midulak) or otherwise. Indoor gardens would take you back to nature the way Thoreau wanted every man to live, as an inhabitant, or a part and parcel of Nature, rather than a member of society. Moreover, indoor plants lavish you with unexpected advantages, like cleaning the air and helping to elevate your mood. Incredibly, according to gardening experts once you know a few simple tricks, an indoor garden is easy to care for. Don't raise your eye-brows to the sky and smile; it is true. As landscape expert Eranga says, if the right amount of sunlight is there, the soil setup cost is very low for indoor plants. So, too the amount of water a plant needs, compared to the amount its counterpart outdoors would consume.
If so, why not, invite some flowers, herbs or vegetable plants to share your living space with you Most plants have simple needs, and as roommates go, they will be relatively undemanding.
Still, there are four basic things you need to understand before you decide to invite a plant home, though: light, water, temperature and air. If you can master these four elements, from a plant's perspective, you can create an indoor garden just about anywhere in your house.
Then again, (if you do not have a mada midulak) how would your garden grow, without the right kind of vessels to keep the trees on their feet Should they be made of clay or cement Should they be as big as barrels or as small as thimbles Relax. Vessels, big or small, clay or not, are totally unnecessary for an indoor garden.
According to Lifelong organic gardner Deborah Stephenson almost anything waterproof can serve as a pot with enough creativity. Instead of paying for costly conventional pots, she suggests all you have to do is think out of the box and fill old handbags, boots, jugs and soda bottles with soil, add a plant, and presto, you have a stylish new planter you won't be ashamed to display.
Growing your own indoor plants can be handy if you are into organic food, too. With a very sunny location, or the help of a hydroponics (growing plants without soil) kit, you can grow tomatoes, chillies and brinjals, to name a few, right in your living room or kitchen. Isn't is wonderful to grow something else other than your appetite
If you still have doubts about the amount of light and water an indoor plant needs you can read all about it in blogs like The Worms Way where experts tell you these are obstacles that can be easily overcome. For instance, there is a simple way to decide if there is enough light in your home for an indoor garden. If you put your hand in front of the window and it does not cast a shadow, chances are the light is not adequate for most plants to live a happy life. You can always overcome this problem with artificial lights, but, if you have modest natural light in your home and do not want to fuss with special lighting, you can stick to plants that normally need low-light conditions, or try moving your garden to a sunny windowsill.
Knowing what water conditions a plant prefers, too, is a good first step to keeping a successful indoor garden. This is easier than you think because the plants themselves will often give you clues. Plants with thick rubbery leaves are water hoarders and can typically survive with less water than plants with thin, delicate leaves. If you don't have enough time to water your plants everyday, choose varieties that can thrive on less, to cut down on your watering chores.
Why waste more time Begin today. Find some plant roommates, who will clean your indoor air, and help discover the inner farmer within you, re-connecting you with nature, one seedling at a time.
As for the aspidistra, I don't want one. But going by what Orwell says in his book, Keep the Aspidistra Flying, you can get anything in this world if you genuinely don't want it, I guess I will end up having an aspidistra growing on my desk, one day. This time around, she will have a better life than Twiggy.
Next week lets move out of doors for a little bit of mud, little bit of digging, little bit of fuss and unlimited fun all in your backyard.

Plans to issue drugs in generic names - Minister
Arrangements will be made within the next two years to issue drugs to patients in generic names, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the gathering after launching several state hospital development projects in the Kalutara district recently, Dr. Senaratne said that he had made a request to the UN to include dengue and CKDU controlling and immunization into the 17 UN Development Goals to be launched on January 1, 2016.
We introduced the Prof. Senaka Bibile Drug Policy and I am very happy about it, because I am one of his students, he said. Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the total coverage of the National Immunization Programme in Sri Lanka is 99 percent which is on par with the US. Australia has only 92 percent of coverage. Immunization is still an issue for many other countries in South East Asia.
Unlike in the past, we have five years ahead of us to develop the countrys free health service. In the past, we had only 100 days to achieve our targets.
During the next five years, we will develop infrastructure facilities in the health sector and upgrade the free health service, he added.

## Title: Pluses and minuses of 'traditionalism'

## Date: Sunday, September 27, 2015 - 18:30
Pluses and minuses of 'traditionalism'
Despite the widely accepted yet least practiced major religions, South East Asian societies continue to be embroiled in turmoil and turbulence. The widespread loss of civility, the callous disregard for others' feelings, the cunning and manipulation that leads to selfishness and self-centredness, starting from the home with its spill over effects in school and workplace has impacted the social whole, tearing a fabric that once was. The finely woven social tapestry - a great celebration of the past with its custom bound, tradition oriented characteristics in the absence of laws, significantly contributed to social progress.
This then brings to writer's mind the utterance of a respected civilized citizen that said, "we talk of a 2,500 year old civilization of which even remnants do not remain. Buddhism that insists on self annihilation has transformed into self propagation. The much venerated old values - the customs, traditions and what not that made us a noble people have meandered. Take Britain for instance - even their system of governance is based on traditions so much so that she does not have a written constitution. Ask a shop keeper for a copy of Britain's constitution and all what you would get is a loud laugh. But here, with a written constitution and that too subject to so many amendments - surely something has gone wrong somewhere. With a historical record of 2,500 years , it is we who should teach the British of custom and tradition based rule and unwritten constitutions."
Violation of human rights
But then the coin's other side is why such a noble people traversed the world over into conquering lands which itself is a violation of human rights. The native population were victims of stress when they lost what was their own - a lifestyle accustomed to for centuries. Yet, they went through the rigours of what modern health experts call post traumatic stress disorders. What competence was available then to test these disorder levels It could be argued that we are better off today with an imposed socio, economic, political, cultural, system not to forget a corrupt, post colonial local political hierarchy that has impeded the pace of development in these Asian countries.
If not for the voyages of discovery, colonial empire building itself would have been defunct and the new system introduced into these colonies - an unrealizable task. These voyages that set the stage for an alien system worldwide following newly found geographical entities was more than a milestone in mankind's history. France, Britain, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands led in empire building and their imposed systems that uprooted the indigenous ones in conquered countries created ever widening class disparities. Social frustration was inevitable.
Pre-colonial times
The newly established socio, economic, political, cultural and legal system was not without its accompanying ailments resulting in confusion and chaos. Ironically, Leonard Woolf, himself the crown's representative over here was overwhelmingly saddened by unfolding events in the British administrative system. The rigid impositions, the laws, the statutes and what not he saw as weighing down the typical Sinhala village rustic so accustomed to a relaxed, leisurely, care free lifestyle - all of which Silindu was an embodiment - in Woolf's book 'Village in the Jungle'. Silindu hobbled along struggling to fit in to the newly established system in his native habitat with its unending hiccups. To him it was soul wrenching. What of human rights violations then
Coupled with this was the entry of ethnicity - a stranger in pre-colonial times. Communal representation for the first time in the legislative council under the British administrative system was mismanaged by the local political elite. In fact ethnicity became the offspring of communal representation and later turned springboard to power installation and extension. Ethnicity was the wellspring for corrupt ultra nationalistic political leadership to win elections in these Asian countries following self-rule that led to the present regional quagmire, needless to speak of religion and the caste based electorate.
Finding fault with the British is ingrained in the national psyche but it needs re-iteration that on the eve of their departure, much to their credit was a sound trade balance they left behind. If discretion was the better part of valour, the political elite in this region could have continued from where they left but as fate mocked, the Asian populace became a destiny driven entity while their greedy leaders began building vast empires for themselves and generations unborn instead of taking off from where the British left, some even projecting themselves as the re-incarnation of their ancient kings. Classing the British administration as being paragons of virtue should not be part of a balanced mind. The pluses and minuses remain.
A scene from the film Baddegama.
People in the lower social order would still have remained there under a caste based society if not for them. Caste then was replaced by class. There came much opportunity for upward social mobility and had caste continued, contemporary socio, political, economic, religious elite would not have found themselves where they are today yet the anti-British cry perpetually persists. As someone said sometime back to such a vociferous crier, "I say, you should be thankful to the Britisher for the trousers you are wearing. Otherwise you would still be in your loin cloth churning pots!"
But regretfully, upward social mobility saw the entry of a value free society as stiff competition for power, position, status and money gripped the social whole. With time's passage, adding fuel to fire as it were, was the effacement of Civics and Ethics from the school curriculum - subjects that moulded the growing mind into all that was elegant and full of finesse.
Financial reservoirs
The liberal market economy in later years also saw sweeping changes in the social landscape. People were further driven to competition. The one time value filled society was uprooted and money over values progressively gained ground. The essence and spirit of religion ceased to be. In every sphere of life, the shell remained while the kernel went missing. Only humans have come to stay, the human being no more. Brick and mortar remain in temple church, kovil and mosque. The congregation warrants soul searching. The politician has come to stay, the statesman no more.
The Asian politician in an ideal state who should have been perfect role model to society knows nothing beyond opulent and ostentatious lifestyles - he, a part of that massive hollow congregation praying steadfastly for election victory and not soul redemption. Anticipating a Joseph Muzica (Uruguay's former simpleton President) from them is akin to seeing feathers in a tortoise.
The bulk in that group became instinctly driven to wallet fattening and continue to remain that way even today with increased intensity at the expense of suffering masses. Foreign bank accounts have swelled into financial reservoirs. Contemporary politics is viewed as 'big business ' - service seemingly a facade. A helpless public became silent onlookers. Significantly, a maturing Asian electorate of late no doubt is a healthy sign where the demand for good governance is a clarion call.
Politicization of government has also led the Asian people into anger and frustration. The respect and regard for politicians is no more as these societies now realize they are a bunch of crooks interested only in personal well-being with exceptions - few and far between.
The only hope then is the right of franchise. But then, here too people remain disgruntled as they see in elections the mere replacement of crooks.

Pop stars, world leaders rally to end poverty
US: Some of the biggest names in music and politics from Beyonce to European Prime Ministers rallied Saturday in a concert aimed at mobilizing action to eradicate extreme poverty.
Before thousands of people in New Yorks Central Park and a far greater audience on television, the Global Citizen Festival sought to use entertainment to broaden support for new United Nations development goals.
Beyonce, playing just her second concert this year, was the top attraction for many fans who obtained tickets not by paying but by committing to activism ranging from writing letters to volunteering.
Other performers included rock veterans Pearl Jam and Coldplay, fresh English pop sensation Ed Sheeran, socially conscious rapper Common and -- in an effort to raise the profile of the festival in India -- leading Bollywood singer Sunidhi Chauhan.
Beyonce closed an energetic set by welcoming to the stage a surprise guest she hugged warmly -- Michelle Obama.
The US first lady encouraged the audience to use social media to campaign on behalf of the estimated 62 million girls worldwide who are not in school.
They deserve the same chances to get an education as my daughters and your daughters and all of our children, she said.
US First Lady Michelle Obama speaking at the 2015 Global Citizen Festival in New York City on Saturday.
And make no mistake about it -- giving them that chance is at the core of our work to end global poverty.
On Friday, the UN endorsed a goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 -- in part by focusing on opportunities for girls, an investment with sweeping consequences for families futures.
Despite wide official endorsements of the so-called Sustainable Development Goals, the UN estimates that achieving them would cost the world up to $5 trillion each year -- a huge commitment.
US Vice President Joe Biden, another unannounced guest at the festival, voiced optimism that the goal was within reach if citizens mobilized. At no time in history has so much power been available to make such a difference for so many people, Biden said.
The Prime Ministers of Luxembourg, Malta, Norway and Sweden came to the festival to offer support, with US President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron appearing by video.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway, one of the worlds top donors, said that the festival should serve as a catalyst for a massive increase in educational funding. She called for the world to ensure that all children in the world can attend school for 12 years, with nine years compulsory.
We have the power to turn the dreams of millions of children into reality, so lets start now, she said.

Pope 'moved' by Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island flight
US: Pope Francis on Saturday flew over the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, the onetime gateway to America for millions of immigrants, by helicopter before leaving New York -- and was reportedly 'very moved' by the experience.
"As we circled Ellis Island, as we circled the Statue of Liberty, I could see he was very 'commosso' - as the Italians say, very moved," CBS Radio quoted Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who was with the pope, as saying.
The impromptu tour came as the 78-year-old pontiff headed by helicopter to New York's John F. Kennedy airport for his flight to Philadelphia.
Francis, the son of Italian immigrants who moved to Argentina, specifically asked the helicopter pilot to make the slight detour over New York Harbour.
Dolan, the archbishop of New York, said Francis had noted that Buenos Aires was "a city of immigrants too."

Premier spells out domestic mechanism
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday spelt out the key features of the domestic mechanism to be implemented following the UNHRC resolution on September 30.
The Prime Minister said that Sri Lanka will co-sponsor the resolution along with the US, and Sri Lanka too will own this resolution.
He said the government did not want any divisions and hoped that all the members of the UNHRC would support it.
It will be a consensus resolution, he added.
Further elaborating on the domestic process, he said three main offices will be set up namely the Missing Persons Office, Special Counsels office and the Truth Commission.
The Truth Commission will have another segment called Compassionate Council. Though it will be headed by a layman, a panel of clergymen - that will include Mahanayakes, Bishops of the Christian and Catholic churches, high priests from the Muslim and the Hindu clergy - would be drawn to form the Compassionate Council.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Missing Persons Office would be a permanent one dealing with relevant complaints.
The Special Counsels office, according to the Prime Minister, will be Sri Lankan and it will decide on the investigations and the cases that should go directly to the judiciary or to the Truth Commission. He was optimistic that many cases will end up in the Truth Commission and the Compassionate Council.
Foreign prosecutors may join according to the situation that would arise from time to time. We have spoken to the US about the formation of the judicial mechanism and it is up to Sri Lanka to formulate new laws, he added.
The Special Counsel may, from time to time, obtain the assistance of international lawyers for the smooth functioning of the office.
In Sri Lanka we have only a few capable officers to handle this kind of work. I have already spoken to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka on this matter, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe emphasised the fact that the process of truth seeking should be short. We will have day to day sittings and only one appeal against orders. The Supreme Court will decide whether foreign defence counsel would be allowed. I told the Bar Association to formulate a mechanism for this too.
President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought in foreign counsels to assist the Paranagama Commission. They sat along with the judges of the commission, the Prime Minister said adding that new laws of will be formulated under article 13 (6) proviso 01 of the present constitution.
Raising the history of the Sri Lanka-UNHRC relationship, the Prime Minister said that everything stems from the 2009 agreement reached by the Sri Lankan government and the United Nations.
At that stage, we did not specify whether it would be an international mechanism or a domestic mechanism. But we presumed that it would be a domestic mechanism. However, we could not fulfill our obligations towards the international community. The recommendations of the LLRC had not been implemented. As a result there had been two more resolutions against Sri Lanka at the UNHRC.
The election victory on January 08, he said, was a watershed in Sri Lankas political history and the government had been able to push the UNHRC report form March to September. If not for the election victory the country would have faced a multitude of problems, including economic sanctions, the Prime Minister said.
Emphasising the need to have political stability, he said by September the government formulated a new set of proposals on accountability and reconciliation.
The Prime Minister said although former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and South African President Jacob Zuma had discussions nothing concrete came about to address the issues of reconciliation.
We have no intention of making military or other members of the security members sacrificial lambs. We have in fact saved the Rajapaksas from the electric chair, he added.
Referring to the LTTE, the Prime Minister said the organisation completely liquidated Tamil democratic leadership and the country has to give ample space to build them up and put forward their point of view. They may have their own views, he said. The damage done to the Tamil community by the LTTE was far more greater than what they did to other communities.
The Prime Minister also hinted that the Right to Information Act and the Audit Bill would be presented to Parliament shortly after Cabinet approval as part of building democratic institutions to strengthen democracy.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne said there has to be a discussion on the composition of the judiciary. The resolution specifically stresses the participation of foreign and commonwealth judges. Defining the term participation he said that the judges are likely to be observers of the process.
In the past, Politicians have ruined our prospects in resolving these matters due to their parochial political agendas. The media too is responsible for this situation, the minister said. Senaratne also criticised Prof. G.L.Pieris and Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka and said that they should come to terms with their own admissions in the past.

Red light on Green tea
What is Hepatitis
Hepatitis is a term used to describe inflammation (swelling) of the liver.
It can occur as the result of a viral infection or because the liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol.
Some types of hepatitis will pass without causing permanent damage to the liver.
Other types can persist for many years and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis).
In the most serious cases, it may lead to loss of liver function (liver failure) or liver cancer, which can both be fatal.
These types of long-lasting hepatitis are known as chronic hepatitis.
Initial symptoms of hepatitis caused by infection are similar to the fluand include: muscle and joint pain a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above feeling sick being sick headache occasionally, yellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)
In many cases hepatitis causes no noticeable symptoms, so when hepatitis is caused by a virus, many people are unaware they are infected. Similarly, many people with hepatitis caused by alcohol are unaware that their drinking is harming their liver.

Teenager who drank three cups of green tea a day develops hepatitis and turns YELLOW due to liver damage 16-year-old began feeling dizzy, sick and had joint and stomach pains Went to A&E where she had turned yellow and had hepatitis - liver swelling She had not drunk alcohol or taken drugs but had been drinking green tea
Doctors say an ingredient in the tea, bought online, caused her illness A teenager who developed severe inflammation of the liver was shocked to discover it was due to the green tea she had been drinking to lose weight.
The unidentified 16-year-old girl went to her GP with dizziness, nausea, stomach and joint pains.
There, the doctor believed it was a urinary tract infection and she was sent home with antibiotics.
But after two doses - and with her symptoms getting worse - she went to the A&E department of a Birmingham hospital.
At this point, she was suffering from jaundice, causing her skin and the whites of her eyes to turn yellow, said doctors describing her case in thejournal BMJ Case Reports.
Her condition was so serious that she was deemed to need critical attention as doctors believed she was suffering from hepatitis, a swelling or inflammation of the liver.
Hepatitis can be caused by a virus, or when the liver is exposed to harmful substances such as alcohol.
But the girl, who was originally from Yemen, denied drinking any alcohol, and said she had not taken any over-the-counter medicines such as paracetamol, or illegal drugs.
She had also not travelled abroad recently, where she could have come into contact with a virus causing hepatitis, and had never had a blood transfusion - another way it can occur.
Then, when doctors questioned her again, she admitted to ordering Chinese green tea over the internet, having been told it could aid weight loss..
She had bought two boxes, each containing 100 tea bags, and had been drinking about three cups a day for a few months.
As most of the ingredients were in Chinese, she had no idea what was in the tea.
Doctors immediately ordered her to stop drinking it, and after treatment with fluids and drugs through a drip, the swelling in her liver went down.
After an investigation, an ingredient in the tea called Camellia sinensis - a shrub whose leaves and buds are used to make drink - was found to have caused the girls illness.
Following a short stay in hospital, she was discharged, and two months later her liver function was found to be normal.
Herbal remedies, including tea and supplements with Camellia sinensis, are readily available from unregulated sources such as the internet and are increasingly used, the authors of the paper wrote.
Green tea has been linked to liver damage in the past, and there are dozens of cases in medical literature documenting people becoming ill after ingesting tea leaf powder, tea infusions and tea extracts, including in diet pills. There are cases where it has lead to patients having such severe liver failure they needed a transplant, and has even caused death, the researchers said.
However the authors did acknowledge that green tea is normally a very safe and healthy drink, with antioxidant properties.
Furthermore, it is the products that are added to the tea, rather than the freshly made leaves, that have been described as causing illness in medical journals, they said. It could be that other chemicals, particularly used in weight loss products, cause liver inflammation.
Or it may be that the pesticides used on the tea trees are to blame.
There is potential for pesticide-induced hepatitis to exist, especially from less regulated products ordered from developing countries over the internet.
They concluded: The use of herbal remedies is under-reported, the breadth of use is under-recognised by clinicians.
Our case is a good illustration of this rare but recurring theme.

Roaming among bookaholics
That mother was vigilant. She kept a sharp eye on the exhibitors, and took quick action. Did she not know that another party would naturally witness her tuck a CD in her childs parcel She not only tucked it in the parcel, but also kept that parcel in another bag.
Such incidents cannot be rare at any exhibition. So the Colombo International Book Fair (CIBF) would be no exception.
CIBF is the bookaholics Mecca  that is for sure. Metaphor aside, there is a lot of cons. These cons, sadly, have survived all the years the fair has been held. It looks like no one in the decision-making body is bothered on taking an action. Well, what can they do, when they have so many other things to be concerned about
The scattered litter is now becoming a usual sight. But you do not need to get irritated. It is part and parcel of our culture. That keep your city clean cannot be spoon-fed. Either you have to be fined as in Singapore or you have to be made aware of the consequences in an effective way. Whether either of this would actually work is still doubtful. The crowd is mostly into literature, and they are hardly bothered about litter around them. It is a tiring, yet interesting, excursion. Walking the hard terrains of BMICH looks actually tiring, when you set sights upon fellow pilgrims take a rest here and there on ubiquitous chairs and pavements.
The Book Fair is larger than life, when you see life more than books. Speaking of English books, most of the classics  apart from hackneyed everlasting Shakespeare  were missing. I heard one say publishers do this on purpose to create a market for the translations of English classics. Maybe not all publishers; I saw some publishers sell the original as well as the translation. For Sinhala readers, the book fair should be fair enough, but still most of the Sinhala classics were missing in the shelves. Old ones should leave shelves providing space for the new ones  should it
On an average stall, you would never miss the sight of readers immersed in books before making the investment. These fast readers at times read the whole book within the stall premises and move on to another book to spare their precious investment. The exhibition crew is very much familiar with this crowd, though they can hardly do anything about it.
Computerized catalogue of the books are still a privilege for the stalls. You will have to browse the books, and even then you would hardly be able to tick off a single title in your list. But let me confess: exhibitors and their helpers are really helpful. If one publisher does not have a book on offer they would direct you to another. You would witness this quite often.
Food! Oh well, the prices are a little improved this time. Except for one or two so-called posh hotels which would never listen to customer pleas, most of the small-scale outlets had good food and drink at reasonable rates. That is why probably the food stalls did not shut down even when the Book Fair officially called it a day at 9 pm and curtains drawn over the book stalls. People still thronged to munch a popcorn, sip a coke and wolf down noodles.
Thank you, Book Publishers Association, for gearing up this overly impressive annual experience; on behalf of all book lovers and bibliophiles  though I am not either.

SLMC welcomes UNHRC resolution
The Sri Lanka Muslims Congress welcomes the draft text of the UN Human Rights Council resolution on Sri Lanka tabled on September 24, at its 30th session, the party said in a statement.
The statement further said: The SLMC considers this consensus resolution, co-sponsored by the Government of Sri Lanka, as an important step in addressing the sufferings experienced by citizens from all communities over the past decades. It also offers the prospect of breaking away from Sri Lankas culture of impunity, carry out institutional and legislative reforms and genuinely entrench good governance and the rule of law.
The SLMC has consistently maintained that peace, security and prosperity require a Sri Lanka, where justice, equality and freedom prevail for all citizens. Although its focus is on the GOSL - LTTE conflict, the reconciliation process should not ignore the plight of the Muslims who suffered in the war as rightly mentioned in the report. This resolution and the formation of a national government create a rare opening for comprehensively addressing the core grievances of victims from all communities and tackling the root causes of conflict.
In particular, the institutional mechanisms outlined in this resolution, if they are genuinely independent and command the confidence of all communities, will also help lay the foundations for genuine reconciliation and a harmonious society.
The Sri Lanka Muslim Congress is committed to assisting in this process and calls upon all stakeholders, including political parties and the civil society, to leave partisan differences aside and ensure that this important process of national healing be implemented in full.
In this context, we welcome the Tamil National Alliances statement asking that the Tamil people of Sri Lanka also to use this moment as a moment of introspection into our own communitys failures and create the right culture and atmosphere in which we could live with dignity and self-respect, as equal citizens of Sri Lanka.
The principle behind this statement applies to all Sri Lankas communities and citizens, while the SLMC will not hesitate to lead our community in making a genuine contribution to justice, peace and reconciliation.
As a party that has steadfastly committed and advocated for a negotiated political settlement to the national question, the SLMC also welcomes the governments commitment to the devolution of political authority which too, ought to be pursued soonest through constitutional reforms to the satisfaction of all communities.
The previous administration had the historical window of opportunity to refashion a Sri Lankan nation at peace with itself reconciled to its pluralist composition. It ignored or failed to contend with the tide of history. We fervently hope that the reconciliation process and the political settlement would be inclusive.

Wales search for replacement contenders
Wales on Sunday considered making a complaint against England hooker Tom Woods as celebrations over their historic win over England were tempered by a rising injury toll.
At least two further replacements could be required with doubts Scott Williams (knee) and Hallam Amos (shoulder) still to be cleared to continue in the tournament after being seriously hurt in Saturday's 28-25 victory at Twickenham.
Liam Williams was stretchered from the ground after he suffered a blow to the head when he appeared to be kicked by Woods.
"There was definitely contact between part of Tom Woods body and Liam's head," assistant coach Shaun Edwards said.
"It's something we're going to look at. Obviously, as regards citing etcetera I think we'll make a comment on that later on but it's clearly obvious there was some contact with the head
"The (citing) decision will be made by our manager. We did lose one of our best players and in the position that we're in, we're quite short (on numbers), so we'll just look at that later and make a decsion."

Wales stun England
Dan Biggar kicked Wales to a stunning 28-25 comeback victory over World Cup hosts England on Saturday as South Africa got their campaign back on course with an emphatic 46-6 triumph over Samoa.
The Welsh hero and South Africa wing JP Pietersen -- scorer of three tries -- were the individual stars on the most electrifying day so far of a World Cup that is keeping the fans on the edge of their seats with upset results and thrilling rugby.
Biggar, who normally sees the kicking duties handled by the injured Leigh Halfpenny, emerged from the shadows to kick 23 points from seven penalties and a conversion -- a record points haul for a Welshman against England.
A brilliant Gareth Davies try capped a determined come-from-behind performance by the Welsh as a whole leaving Biggar embarrassed at being named man of the match.
Wales were at one stage 19-9 down before the packed 81,100 crowd at Twickenham.For us to come here, no one gave us a hope. I feel cheeky taking man of the match. It should be shared by all of the boys today, said 25-year-old Biggar.
We kept on believing. We kept sticking to our structure. It was the best days rugby of our careers.
The victory has seen Wales take a huge step towards the last eight although they still have two testing games to come against the unpredictable Fijians, who beat them in the 2007 finals, and the two-time world champion Wallabies.
England must now beat world number two side Australia in their next game with coach Stuart Lancaster saying he was gutted by the defeat after establishing a comfortable lead.
We have talked a lot about discipline and breakdown penalties and we gave some dumb ones away which allowed them to keep in the game, he said.
There was also much debate about the decison by captain Chris Robshaw to opt not for a kick at goal when England was awarded a penalty two minutes from the end which if successful would have at least drawn the sides level.
Instead of that he decided instead go for a game-winning try -- unlike the Japanese the Saturday before against the South Africans this time it didnt come off.

Wallabies crush Uruguay
Sean McMahon led Australia to the top of their World Cup group on Sunday with a comprehensive 65-3 victory over minnows Uruguay ahead of crunch matches with archrivals England and Wales.
Australia ran in 11 tries -- two each from McMahan, returning exile Drew Mitchll and Ben McCalman -- but largely appeared to do the minimum necessary for victory in the Pool A match at Villa Park.
Henry Speight got one of the tries of the tournament at the end of a 65 metre run. Joe Tomane, Dean Mumm, Matt Toomua and Tevita Kuridrani got the others.
With the starting XV boasting 14 changes from the side that laboured to an opening 28-13 victory over Fiji, Australia were by far the superior team.
Victory left the Wallabies in first place in the "pool of death" on nine points with a points difference of +77.
Wales are second, also on nine points (+48pts) and England third on six (+21). Australia play England and Wales over the next two weekends.
McMahon, who played a vintage game at openside flanker against an outpowered and outpaced opposition, opened the scoring, peeling off from a driving maul for an easy run-in.
From the restart, McMahon broke clear, the ball was played right, Quad Cooper's smart offload seeing Tomane in for a try with Uruguay looking shaky in defence.
The other side of Cooper's game was witnessed when he caught Uruguay scrum-half Agustin Ormaechea around the neck and flung him to the floor. French referee Pascal Gauzere had no option but to brandish a yellow card.
The Australian team completely dominated the set-piece, but poor handling ruined many a clean linebreak.
Felipe Berchesi kicked a 24th penalty for Uruguay, just desserts for a dogged display by a team boasting just four professional players and ranked just 19th in the world.
As Cooper came back on, a consolidated Wallaby advance ended with skipper Mumm shrugging off the lame challenge of Leandro Leivas to dot down.
The requisite bonus point came on the half-hour mark when a slick backline move resulted in Speight sprinting in with a swallow-dive to the corner.
