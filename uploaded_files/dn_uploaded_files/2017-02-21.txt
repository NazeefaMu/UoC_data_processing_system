Immortal mission
Scholars opine music could be a gift by the gods to mortals. Ravanas legend says King Ravana had associated with immortals and music is one thing they gifted him besides power to be airborne.
It is said in Buddhist history; Lord Buddha had listened to Pansilus Veena music recitals once and commended him. The divine aspect of music is shed light upon by a rare breed of musicians in the world from time to time, something laymen can only enjoy but never have the capacity to define with mere words.
Dinesh Subasinghe is a young musician who came to limelight with Rawanahatha musical instrument some years back. Inclination to music came to Dinesh from his bloodline. His father who had been a member of the Navy band in 1970s was related to B A W Jayamanna, elder brother of Eddie Jayamanna.
Dinesh had learned finer points in music from the veteran B Victor Perera. The maestro had taught his last music lesson to Dinesh prior to the day he bade adieu to mortal life.
Association with world renowned musicians like Maestro Premasiri Khemadasa and Indian musician A R Rahman added immense value to his vibrant melodious career. Dineshs innovations in music with Ravanahatha were reckoned in the international sphere too.
In the local context, composing touching music scores for Wariga Pojja and Ho Gana Pokuna cinemas positioned him as a young and resourceful musician who makes haunting music scores that exceed the limits of vocals.
Dinesh also has in his kitty a range of stage drama and tele-drama music directions done by him. His tele-drama music direction stint commenced with Chandraratna Mapitigamas Hummanaya in 2003. Dinesh has so far composed music for 75 tele-dramas which is a new record.
In his latest interview with the Daily News T&C Dinesh told music has a healing power and he intends to explore into grasping spiritual facets in music.
Excerpts of the interview
You have added more value to your awards galore lately.
Winning five awards for making music scores for Ho Gana Pokuna and the TOYP award in 2016 is significant in my music career.
The TOYP award is given annually to ten outstanding young persons of the world. In 2016 I was awarded for my contribution to Sri Lankan Arts.
After the stint with A R Rahman you move into film music scoring.
Yes. However it was not a bed of roses. I sweated a lot to entice local film directors with my work. I used to show them pieces of music I composed for Passion Plays in Duwa, Negombo.
You have made music scores for 75 tele-dramas to date. This is a record. Your comment
I happen to be the youngest amongst seniors Maestro Khemadasa, Dr Rohana Weerasinghe and Navaratna Gamage to achieve such a feat.
I have so far worked in 146 teledramas as an instrumentalist and made tunes for 75. Further I have contributed as an instrumentalist to 47 films and composed music for 12 films and 20 stage plays.
At the inception of your career you did a CD with the instrument Ravanahatha. Why were you so passionate towards this ancient musical instrument
My first solo album was Ravan Nada in which I brought to fore sounds of the Ravanahatha instrument. I made an instant liking towards this instrument given to me by a friend and developed it further to play in many forums here and abroad.
Even Indians have their version of this instrument and they too call it Ravanhatha. There exists a long history associated with this instrument. The Ravanahatha was played in Hrithik Roshans movie Mohenjo Daro in which A R Rahman did the music. I believe King Ravana was someone who stood for humanity, no matter whether he was just a myth or a real being.
You seem to possess a lot of knowledge on religions, doctrines, and philosophies. Do you read a lot
We as musicians should have a philosophy to compose music. Maestro Khemadasa was one who had such strong philosophy inclined towards communism. With Landune song he honored a prostitute and made the society to accept that. I was inspired greatly by him.
This Samsara is a rotation and people who lived in ancient times may be living in present times too. We need to read the past lives of people to do justice to present context.
Reading Devadatta, Maria Magdalena, Patachara or the like will guide a musician to make music scores in present day creations. I do that.
History, philosophy and religion provide a wealth of knowledge to any music composer apart from music itself.
Can a composer who lacks that knowledge send vibes among the society
A philosophical musician will live even after his death. Music is not meant to provide mere fun and we as musicians should bear that in mind.
Do you believe in your Rashi and written destiny of your life
The answer wont be a firm No. Yet at one crucial stage in my life I got a blessing from some unknown force that brightened my life.
I won awards at a time when the written destiny said otherwise. I believe any man can change his destiny with will power.
There is another aspect to winning awards. Awards give us courage and motivation. But after winning those one should keep them aside and get back to basics.
What are your current projects
Adara Dadayama (ITN) and Devliya (Swarnavahini) are two tele-dramas to be telecast with my music scores. I compose music for Ranjan Ramanayakes movie Doctor Navariyan.
What else is in store for us from you in future
I aspire to connect music with spirituality and technology. There is no proper university in the world to teach how to stimulate vibes of a listener. I am training myself to conduct a spiritual musical concert in five years time.
I believe music has been given to us by immortals. We take hold of only a limited frequency or range from this vast universe of music. But we humans have the capacity to grasp more. Apart from taking away stress and depression from people, music can do wonders. Healing is one such thing. Some voices are registered in the healing frequency. One such voice we have belongs to Dayaratne Ranatunga.

Marina educates consumers at CHEMEX 4 exhibition
Marina Foods, a manufacturer of coconut oil in Sri Lanka, outlined its processes of producing safe and hygienic coconut oil, using state-of-the-art technology in compliance with internationally accepted quality standards to the participants, including school children, at the CHEMEX 4 Exhibition and Trade Fair.
The three-day unique chemical educational event organized by the Institute of Chemistry was held at the Sri Lanka Exhibition and Convention Centre in Colombo recently.
Marina Foods (Pvt) Ltd is a subsidiary of NMK Group of Companies. Expressing his views, Manjula Narayana, Chairman NMK Group of Companies, said:
Certain companies which concentrate solely on making hefty profits without reaching out to help the community at large, through corporate responsibility initiatives, are propagating a myth that coconut oil contains cholesterol. It is important to bear in mind that coconut oil manufactured in a scientific manner using modern technology, which ensures high quality, goodness and hygienic standards in no way jeopardizes the health of the consumer.
Marina Foods (Pvt) Ltd actively participated in the CHEMEX 4 with the core objective of further educating the people on this subject. The good health of the masses in the long-term is more important to us than short-term commercial profits.
Members of the public and school children attending the CHEMEX 4 Exhibition were educated on the importance of having such modern technology and the pragmatic role it plays in producing edible oil absolutely safe for human consumption.
When producing coconut oil in the traditional way, active properties found in coconut oil which are beneficial to human health are destroyed. It results in the accumulation of chemicals in coconut oil, which are deleterious to human health. But in the manufacture of Marina coconut oil products, none of these reactions adverse to human health occur.

A reel treat!
China and Sri Lanka have celebrated 60 years of diplomatic relations. It would be accurate to say that relations between China and Sri Lanka are the stuff of legend. In fact legend is the correct word because our relations date back over hundreds of years.
Both countries have become popular destinations for tourists. Fa-Hien the celebrated Chinese Buddhist pilgrim traveled to Sri Lanka, visiting Anuradhapura in 413 A.D. Chinese General Cheng-Ho who visited Sri Lanka left a record in a tri-lingual stone inscription before he left. In this slab the three faiths Buddhism, Hindu and Islam are revered in a single inscription.
Since then the relationships between both countries have come a long way, with the Chinese media streaming into the island. One needs to only frequent Colombo to see Chinas hand in our industry. Daily News attended the opening ceremony of the second Chinese Film Festival which was graced by the presence of Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathilaka. The film festival began on February 16 and will end on the 21st. It will feature eight movies ranging from youth to romance to action. It is free of charge for the public.
Family reunions
Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka with NFC Chairman Deepal Chandrarathne
Last year the Chinese Film Festival attracted a monumental audience. This will be the second Chinese Film Festival in Sri Lanka. It is one of the major events held to celebrate the Chinese New Year. The Chinese New Year is also called the Spring Festival in China. All these festivals in China date back 4000 years. It is important for the Chinese people, because Spring festival means family reunions and gatherings in China. The Chinese New Year celebrations will bring joy and harmony to the Sri Lankan people, said the Political Counselor at the Embassy of China in Sri Lanka, Pang Chunxue. Chunxue also commented that the Spring Festival is one of the major programs to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Sri Lanka. It is also the 65th anniversary of the signing of our rubber and the rice pact between China and Sri Lanka. China and Sri Lanka are close neighbors enjoying centuries of friendship. 60 years ago we established diplomatic relations and because of the concerted effort of both sides, the bilateral relationships have always been based on sound understanding despite the internal conflict of both nations.
We are very proud of the tremendous achievements achieved through the bilateral relations during these six decades, explained Chunxue. Chunxue stressed that there is a certain confidence about the future of our bilateral relations.
This will be even better in the years to come. China is ready to work with Sri Lanka for the well- being of our two peoples and for the lasting friendship between our two nations. Last and not least, I would like to use this opportunity to extend my gratitude to the National Film Corporation of Sri Lanka and the public performance board for the great support for this festival. I wish all a happy and prosperous Chinese New year, summed up Chunxue Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunathilaka did not conceal his heartfelt pleasure at attending the opening ceremony. His speech was filled with warmth and passion.
Strengthening relations
As you are all aware China and Sri Lanka relations date back many centuries. Throughout the years our relations were strengthened with ever more warmth and friendship. And it will continue to be so for centuries to come. If you look at our history, centuries back, the monk Fa-Hien and admiral Cheng Ho gives us evidence of strong and bonded ties that we enjoy.
Pang Chunxue
This year marks the 60 anniversary of diplomatic relations between our two nations. If you examine history, I am honored and humbled to say that Sri Lanka has recognized the formation of Peoples Republic of China, by being one of the very first nations to do so in 1948 by our first Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake who was also the founding leader of the United National Party which I represent as a member of Parliament and Cabinet Minister today, said Karunathilaka. Karunathilaka also pointed out that it is worth mentioning that the historical rubber-rice pact which was signed in 1952, was again under the leadership of the United National Party government which brought immense benefit to Sri Lanka.
Official ties
Therefore I would be proud to say that even before we established official diplomatic ties in 1957, the Sri Lanka government had official ties with Peoples Republic of China since its formation in 1948, pointed out Karunathilaka This is the second time we are having a Chinese Film Festival during their new year season. When we Sri Lankans celebrate new year in April according to the Solar Calendar, Chinese Celebrate their new year according to the lunar calendar. Last month, January 28, Chinese people around the world welcomed the year of the Rooster according to the Chinese tradition.
Therefore my new year wish to your excellency, the Ambassador, is that during the year of the Rooster may we be able to organize a Sri Lankan Film Festival in China. As Sri Lankans we love eating Chinese foods. Or watching Chinese martial arts movies.
I believe that although we have strong political, economic and foreign relations with China, we bond with China through social and cultural ties at a personal level even more strongly, elucidated Karunathilaka Karunathilaka expressed his views that if you want to understand a countrys culture and social life you need to see their art, music, drama, food, fashion and history. But if you look at a film from that country you will see all of this entwined nicely. Therefore I appreciate the effort of the Chinese Embassy and the Chinese Cultural Center in Colombo and the National Film Corporation for organizing this film festival. I wish this film festival be a success and gift to the Chinese New Year, summed up Karunathilaka. Pictures by Sarath Peiris

Another strong year for air travel demand in 2016
Geneva - The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced full-year global passenger traffic results for 2016 showing demand (revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) rose 6.3% compared to 2015 (or 6.0% if adjusted for the leap year). This strong performance was well ahead of the ten-year average annual growth rate of 5.5%. Capacity rose 6.2% (unadjusted) compared to 2015, pushing the load factor up 0.1 percentage points to a record full-year average high of 80.5%.
A particularly strong performance was reported for December with an 8.8% rise in demand outstripping 6.6% capacity growth.
Air travel was a good news story in 2016. Connectivity increased with the establishment of more than 700 new routes. And a $44 fall in average return fares helped to make air travel even more accessible. As a result, a record 3.7 billion passengers flew safely to their destination. Demand for air travel is still expanding.
The challenge for governments is to work with the industry to meet that demand with infrastructure that can accommodate the growth, regulation that facilitates growth and taxes that dont choke growth. If we can achieve that, there is plenty of potential for a safe, secure and sustainable aviation industry to create more jobs and increase prosperity, said Alexandre de Juniac, IATAs Director General and CEO. International Passenger Markets International passenger traffic rose 6.7% in 2016 compared to 2015. Capacity rose 6.9% and load factor fell 0.2 percentage points to 79.6%. All regions recorded year-over-year increases in demand.
Asia Pacific carriers recorded a demand increase of 8.3% compared to 2015, which was the second-fastest increase among the regions. This pace is considerably ahead of the five-year growth average of 6.9%. Capacity rose 7.7%, pushing up the load factor 0.4 percentage points to 78.6%. Domestic air travel rose 5.7% in 2016. Capacity rose 5.1% and load factor was 82.2%, up 0.5 percentage points over 2015. All major markets except Brazil showed growth, but India and China, with RPK expansion of 23.3% and 11.7% respectively, were the stand-out performers. These markets have been underpinned by additional routes and increasing flight frequencies, with the latter looking set to continue in 2017.

Appreciates Govts efforts to bring perpetrators to book
The Free Meedia Movement (FMM) in a statement yesterday appreciated the efforts by the Government to take the perpetrators of the Keith Noyahr assault into custody.
Although it took some time for the arrest of Major Bulathwatte and two other Sergeants, the arrests have been hailed as a major breakthrough. The Free Media Movement further demanded the government to complete the investigations in an independent and impartial manner.
The statement further said after the abduction of Keith Noyahr who was a co-editor in The Nation newspaper, media organisations acted immediately and demanded the then government to release him drawing the attention of the international community, thus compelling the perpetrators had abandoned him.
The statement also said that it was reported that the same Major of the Army Intelligence Unit who was arrested on February 18 had been allegedly accused for the assassination of Lasantha Wickramatunge of the Sunday leader and for the assault of Upali Thennakoon of the Rivira newspaper. According to the statement, it was also revealed that the Criminal Investigation Unit is prepared to arrest a few more suspects. It said further that with the continuous lobbying by the Free Media Movement and other media organisations, a mere commencement of an investigation is not adequate; the process of delivering justice for the killed, disappeared, assaulted journalists and destroyed media institutions in the recent past should be expedited. The Free Media Movement went on to say in its statement that without suspicious and disagreeable actions among the media fraternity, such as reinstating the army personnel who were accused and then bailed out for the alleged disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda, this investigation should be completed independently.

Beauty in diversity
Insightful and experienced, Sumaiya Sinhawansa has been tested by competition and has turned into a young woman who prizes hard work and determination. Resiliency being her hall mark, Daily News speaks to Sumaiya Sinhawansa, a girl who welcomes diversity and has no illusions about the profession.
Q: Tell me the exact nature of the competition you took part in and became runners up in
A. I took part in Miss Sri Lanka in Europe 2016. It is a beauty pageant for (half) Sri Lankan girls living in Europe. All revenue went to a foundation for cancer and kidney patients in Sri Lanka.
Q: How did this competition transform your career
A. After the pageant I realized I could do modeling. This is something I have never considered before. The pageant gave me a head start and having a title definitely makes it a little easier. At the moment I am still getting things started, so I am open for new projects.
Q: You are 27 years old and you live in Germany and you do modeling What is the modeling industry like in Germany and why did you take up modeling
A. I do live in Germany and at the moment I am still in the process of understanding the modeling industry and how it works. I am just getting my foot into the business.
I came up with the idea of modeling after I won 1st runner-up in the pageant. I never thought I would do so well in the pageant. Also, I really liked walking on stage and getting my hair and make-up done and trying on different outfits.
Q: As a beauty queen what have been the challenges you have encountered in this profession
A. So far, I dont have much experience in this profession, but it is definitely tougher than I thought. It all looks nice and easy but it actually involves a lot of hard work. Competition is high. It is very difficult to land jobs, so it is important to have a good network of people and if you can, sign up with a modeling agency.
Q: How many pageants have you taken part in and can you name them How did you fare in those competitions
A. This was my first and only pageant so far. I won first runner-up and Miss Talent.
Q: What are you doing these days
A. I travel a lot and work as a freelance translator. Im trying to enjoy my time as much as I can.
Q: What is your message to the youth
A. In respect to beauty: As long as you are healthy and not overweight there is absolutely no need to strive to be skinny like most models on the cover of the magazines.
You need to realize, as well, that most photos are retouched (watch out on Instagram!) and that it is normal to have cellulite, blemishes and dark circles under the eyes. Dont let social media fool you. Use it as a source of inspiration, but dont let it make you feel bad about yourself and want to compete with others. There is only one you, focus on making yourself better, everyday. The only person you need to be better than is who you are now.
Also, in the light of current events in the world, I urge the youth to educate themselves and be open-minded. I am the product of an interracial relationship and I wouldnt want it any other way. People of all races, religions and ethnicities are welcome in our house. Be very careful what the media serves you. It is important that you filter from the flood of information that is at our fingertips nowadays and go out and make your own experiences. Diversity and integrity are topics that are near to my heart.
Q: What are your goals, dreams and ambitions
A. Personally, I always wanted to be a surgeon and that topic is not closed for me, yet. I will keep on trying, because no profession holds my interest as surgery and medicine do.
Q: Who have been your greatest influences in life
A. My greatest influence are my parents, of course. I can remember my dad instilling important values in me from a very young age. I would say he is the person that made me so ambitious. My mom is the calmer person who always cheered me on and always found a way when things got tough for us. Without the motivational talks and support of my parents, I would not have my Masters Degree or would have traveled the world the way I did. You cannot ask for better influencers and supporters in your life.
The person I look up to is not even a real person, but I always looked up to Dr. Christina Yang from Greys Anatomy! I love her drive, ambition and spirit. She is just a genius!
The people I admire in my profession are all those models that dont cater to the regular model requirements. Also, I am a huge advocate for diversity, so I love it when I see people of color in magazines.
Q: What do you cherish the most in life
A. Health, because we do not appreciate it when we have it. I once battled a Myocarditis. I had to bed rest, because my case was very severe. Until that point in my life I never appreciated the fact that I and my family were healthy. I took my health for granted. After the heart muscle infection I learned to cherish my health. Also, working at the hospital at around that same time and seeing one of my patients die from a mere nose bleed made me realize how lucky we were and that illness or death could hit any of us, any time.
Thats why I take care of my health, and make sure my family does the same. Money, love, education, success-none of those can be enjoyed fully if you are not in good health.
Q: What kind of advice would you give to a girl who wants to enter the industry you are into
A. Think about it carefully. I was considering pageantry for about a year until I decided to go ahead with it. Once you step on that stage, people will film you and take photos of you. These days a lot of manipulation is happening once your photos are online, so you need to be sure you really want this, with the possible scenario of someone stealing your photos and making fake profiles of you (yes, this has happened to me before). Also, dont expect a stellar career once you start in this industry. It takes a lot of hard work and competition is high. You will experience setbacks, too, so it is important that you are resilient. It is very important that you are confident, too. Sometimes you may be at a pageant or a casting and suddenly think that the other girls are much prettier than you  which is not true, because beauty is very subjective. Thats why I like the Miss Universe slogan so much. Just be confidently beautiful!
Q: What is the beauty pageant industry like in Germany What kind of a potential does it have
A. In Germany, pageants dont get much of attention. I told my friends I became first runner-up in a pageant and they werent really excited about it, but congratulated me. When my family in Sri Lanka heard about my pageant title, they all contacted me and were over the moon! There is a big difference in popularity of pageants in Germany and Sri Lanka. If you win a pageant in Germany it probably doesnt open as many doors as a pageant win in Sri Lanka would.

British Council celebrates UK Sri Lanka partnership dialogue
The British Council in Sri Lanka hosted media and guests at an event to celebrate UK-Sri Lanka Partnership Dialogue under the theme of Responsible Education for the 21st Century. The event was held at the Mahaweli Reach Hotel in Kandy on February 16.
This initiative is linked to British Councils Schools Programme, which aims to connect the UK and Sri Lankan school sectors to enrich education, promote global citizenship and build international trust and understanding.
The programme helps teachers bring awareness and understanding of global issues to young people by linking classrooms and schools, between the UK, Sri Lanka and other overseas countries. Since 2012 the programme has supported over 300 links, delivered courses and online training to over 1000 Sri Lankan teachers and enhanced the leadership skills of 150+ other head teachers across Sri Lanka.
The focus of the 21st century skills training is embedding 21st century learning skills into local classroom practices. This was initiated in June 2015. The training offered professional development opportunities for Sri Lankan teachers and head teachers on six 21st century skills through classroom based educational action research. These skills are; student leadership and personal development, citizenship, communication and collaboration, critical thinking and problem solving, creativity and imagination, and digital literacy.
After completing classroom action research, teachers were eligible to apply for professional partnership and with a partner school in the UK. Over an 18 month period the British Council has trained 800 teachers and 250 head teachers via this course. The Central Province in particular was a keen partner, with 5 out of 11 successful partnerships. 190 teachers and head teachers received the above training from the central province.

CMA workshop on Integrated Reporting (IR) practical aspects
The Institute of Certified Management Accountants of Sri Lanka (CMA) will hold a workshop on "Integrated Reporting- Practical Aspects" to be held on Tuesday February 28, at Taj Samudra, Colombo from 1.30 pm to 5.00 pm.
This workshop will enable companies preparing Integrated Reports (IR) to achieve excellence, improve their reports and enter the CMA Excellence in IR Awards which will be held in July this year at the inauguration of the Annual Conference. The Ten Best IR will receive awards together with the Overall Winner and Runner Up. A special award will also be made for the most concise report.
IR is enhancing the way organizations think, plan and report the value creation story of their business and will be based on the IIRC Reporting Framework.
Organizations are using IR to communicate a clear, concise, integrated story that explains how all of their resources are creating value. IR is helping businesses to think holistically about their strategy and plans, make informed decisions and manage key risks to build investor and stakeholder confidence and improve future performance. It is shaped by a diverse coalition including business leaders and investors to drive a global evolution in corporate reporting.
IR applies principles and concepts that are focused on bringing greater cohesion and efficiency to the reporting process, and adopting 'Integrated Thinking'as a way of breaking down internal silos and reducing duplication. It improves the quality of information available to providers of financial capital to enable a more efficient and productive allocation of capital. Its focus on value creation, and the 'capitals' used by the business to create value over time, contributes towards a more financially stable global economy.
The purpose of the IR Framework is to establish Guiding Principles and Content Elements that govern the overall content of an integrated report, and to explain the Fundamental Concepts that underpin them.
In order to assist companies in the preparation of Integrated Reports CMA is organizing this workshop to give participants an overview of the process and practical aspects of preparing an Integrated Report followed by a panel discussion by experts in IR to enable participants to solve their practical problems in the preparation of IR.
The welcome address and introduction to the workshop and Excellence in IR Awards will be delivered by Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala, President of CMA. Key Note address on "Understanding IR" will be delivered by Suresh Gooneratne, Chief Financial Officer at Diesel & Motor Engineering (DIMO) who has been involved with the Integrated Reporting Council and was the only Sri Lankan company engaged in the IIRC Pilot Study and has won many awards at the Integrated Reporting Awards both locally and internationally.

Colombo City Centre architects present ideas for city of tomorrow
It may be more prudent to create high density clusters of multi-function spaces and transport hubs than a continued urban sprawl architect Simon Griffiths from UK said, speaking at the 34th National Conference on Architecture on February 15.
Addressing a gathering of more than one thousand architects, public officials, general public, students and media personnel at the BMICH, Griffiths shared his ideas and experiences gathered working extensively in Asia as an Executive Principal for Aedas; a global architectural and design firm considered to be among the top 10 in the world.
The National Conference on Architecture is organised by the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects. This years conference theme was Return of the City, Megastructure redefined. Architect Thilan Koththigoda of KWA Architects chaired the session.
Aedas along with their Sri Lankan counterpart KWA Architects are the designers for Colombo City Centre, one of the largest mixed developments under construction in Colombo with over a million square feet of space spread over 48 stories including luxury apartments, city hotel & a multi-level retail mall.
As new trade corridors expand such as the focus by China on the 21st century Silk Road which is to connect Asia with Europe, the role of cities as catalysts for trade between Asia and the rest of the world needs to respond and adapt Griffiths elaborated while also highlighting the issues with current trends of urbanisation seen in Asia.
The problem with many of the cities that we have witnessed throughout Asia, is that as the cities expand ever outwards to accommodate the increased growth. The infrastructure, schooling, transport and communication with the additional demand, becomes more stretched, and the essence of what a city is, starts to break down.
Densification of existing cities with mega structures or high density buildings with integrated transport hubs, parks, work, rest and play lifestyles may become the model that all future cities need to move to Architect Simon Griffiths further elaborated concluding the session.
Aedas operates from 14 offices from Hong Kong to Los Angeles. With their extensive presence in China and South East Asia, they are at the cutting edge of the rapid development and growth of emerging markets, and use this experience and understanding, to provide design solutions that will meet the demands of the Asia of the future.

Despite the 13th Amendment, powers not divided: Kiriella
Ever since our country gained independence, the main objective of all parties was to gain political control instead of focusing on the country, Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Even though the 30 year war has ended, the issues between ethnic groups have not yet been solved. Despite the 13th Amendment, distribution of powers has not been properly divided, he said.
The Minister stated these views attending the commencement of development of the Badulla -Chenkaladi Road as the Chief Guest on Sunday. The project is being conducted under the supervision of the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways and the Road Development Authority. The road is 147km long and Rs. 21 billion is being spent on the development of this road.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa accepted that the 13th Amendment was insufficient for the country. It was he who first stated that authority beyond the 13th Amendment was necessary. If we had divided powers when we gained independence, our country wouldve been a developed country. When the Soulbury Constitution was being drafted, many party leaders made requests for the powers to be divided as India had done according to their constitution. When India gained independence their leaders divided powers, which is why India is united today, he said.
Kiriella said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have given our country a fresh start. Our country didnt get the new beginning we needed after the end of the war. A new beginning can only start with the making of a new constitution. For that, both main parties must work together, draft a new constitution and put it forth to a referendum.

Dickwella banned from playing in tomorrows T-20 match

Sri Lankas Niroshan Dickwella has been suspended for two limited-over matches after his accumulated demerit points reached five within a 24-month period following his latest breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for which he received a 30 per cent fine and two demerit points.
 During the second Twenty20 International against Australia in Geelong on Sunday, Dickwella was found guilty of breaching article 2.1.5 of theICC Code of Conduct for Player and Player Support Personnel, which relates to showing dissent at an umpires decision during an international match.
 As Dickwella had received a 50 per cent fine and three demerit points in the fourth One-Day International against South Africa in Cape Town on 8 February 2017, with the addition of these two demerit points, he has reached the minimum threshold of four demerit points, which, pursuant to article 7.6 of the Code, have now been converted into two suspension points. Two suspension points equate to a ban from one Test or two ODIs or two T20Is, whatever comes first for the player.
 As such, Dickwella has been suspended from his sides third Twenty20 International against Australia to be played in Adelaide on 22 February as well as the next limited overs match he is likely to play, which is currently scheduled to be the first One-Day International against Bangladesh on 25 March.
 The five demerit points will remain on Dickwellas disciplinary record for a period of twenty-four months from their imposition and if he reaches eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, then they will be converted into four suspension points. Four suspension points equate to a ban from two Tests or four ODIs or four T20Is, whatever comes first for the player.
 The incident in Geelong happened when Dickwella, after being given out caught behind, paused to view the replay, kicked the turf and looked at his shoulder for a prolonged period of time.
 In a related incident, Australia wicketkeeper, Tim Paine, has been fined 15 per cent of his match fee and received one demerit point for breaching Article 2.1.7 of the Code, which relates to using language, actions or gestures which disparage or which could provoke an aggressive reaction from a batsman upon his/her dismissal during an International Match.
 The incident happened when Paine used inappropriate words after Dickwella had been given caught behind.
 The charges were leveled by on-field umpires Simon Fry and Sam Nogajski, third umpire Joel Wilson and fourth official Michael Graham-Smith
 For all first offences, Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a players match fee, and one or two demerit points.

EU citizens living in the UK could face legal limbo after Brexit
The EU fears millions of its nationals living in the UK will be left stranded in a legal no mans land after the country leaves the EU because of the weaknesses of the British immigration system, a document obtained by the Observer reveals.
MEPs and senior European diplomats fear that chaos will ensue as the Home Office does not have the information or systems in place to select who canstay, once the UK restricts access to nationals from the other 27 EU member states. It is widely assumed that, at an early stage of the article 50 negotiations, Britain and the EU will agree a cut-off date after which foreigners who have settled in the country will not have an automatic right to remain.
But a leaked document, drawn up by MEPs on the European parliaments employment committee to aid the EUs Brexit negotiations, warns: The UK has no population register. In practice it would be difficult to determine which EU27 citizens were residing legally in the UK before the Brexit would have taken effect.
If all 3.3 million EU citizens were to initiate procedures aimed at proving the exercise of treaty rights the administrative system would be overburdened.
An Opinium poll for the Observer published today finds that a large majority of Britons believe EU nationals living in the UK should be given the automatic right to stay. Just 5% said they should be asked to leave, but eight months after last Junes referendum, uncertainty about the future has become a source of deep anxiety among European citizens living in the UK.
Responding to the Brussels report, one senior diplomat from an eastern European state, said: It came as a surprise to me that the UK was unable to monitor comings and goings,they will have to find a workable solution quickly.
Tony Blairs government was forced to drop plans for a national ID card and population register in 2007 because of concerns over the security of citizens data, not least from David Davis, now secretary of state for exiting the EU.
The Cabinet Office advises that EU nationals do not need to register for any documentation in order to enjoy free movement rights and responsibilities in the UK.
The government does not track EU nationals as they enter and leave the country. The databases of the Department for Work and Pensions, HM Revenue and Customs and the Home Office do not share information.
The government could use the national insurance number system to help distinguish between those who were in the country before and after Brexit, but it would not cover those who neither work nor claim benefits. Allowing the right of residence to anyone who has registered for a national insurance number before a particular date would also give a right to stay to potentially millions of people who are no longer in the country, including those who were in the UK only briefly and have little or no connection to the UK.
It would also not deal with the question of the rights of family members of those with national insurance numbers to join their relatives in the country.
Last week Theresa May stressed the importance of an early deal on EU citizens rights after Brexit during talks with the French prime minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, at Downing Street, amid growing criticism of thegovernments refusal to give early and absolute assurances. Some ministers have suggested that the issue will be a bargaining chip in the talks.
Responding to the leaked document, Keir Starmer, shadow secretary of state for exiting the EU, told the Observer that the government had not done enough. He said: This report reinforces the need for the PM to take decisive action to support EU nationals in the UK. For months Labour has
called for the PM to show a lead on this and to end unnecessary uncertainty for EU nationals. Not only has Theresa May failed to do so, but we now hear of real concern that the immigration system she presided over for six years may not be able to properly process EU nationals cases. The PM needs to act swiftly to address this  both by unilaterally granting residency rights for EU nationals already in the UK and by ensuring the Home Office has the necessary resources in place.

European Union-funded housing project commences in Kilinochchi,Mullaitivu and Batticaloa
More than 215, 000 people will benefit from a Euro 14 million multi-faceted housing project, financed by the European Union (EU), and implemented by Habitat for Humanity and World Vision Lanka.
Speaking during the opening ceremony, Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives for the Delegation of the European Union (EU), ung-La Margue said, "I am hopeful that this project will assist in providing returnee families with not just homes and livelihood alternatives but also the necessary support to rebuild a life and a future for themselves. The goal has always been to turn the cycle of impoverishment and reliance to that of self-sufficiency, and I am encouraged to see that we are moving in the right direction through this initiative".
The project, which bridges the gap between relief, rehabilitation and development, aims to build 2,315 houses and repair 140 homes in 31 divisions across Batticaloa, Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu by early 2020. It utilises alternative materials and techniques to reduce constructions costs, while ensuring decent housing, and to encourage the use and production of locally manufactured earth blocks and construction materials.
The project is aptly entitled Homes not Houses. Indeed we wish to see thriving communities that are self-sufficient, stable and strong, once our building work is done and we are long gone.
Thanks to the focus of this funding from the European Union the project aims to boost the local economy by investing in earth-based technologies which are cost-effective and sustainable, said Torre Nelson, Area Vice President for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Habitat for Humanity. Commenting, on this endeavor, National Director of World Vision Lanka, Dhanan Senathirajah, said We are proud to be associated with this project. One of the main strengths of World Vision Lanka is its community engagement and livelihood development expertise. I believe our interventions in this sphere will be key to transform houses into happy and stable homes.

Expansion of Indira Gandhi International Airport may hit passengers hard
The country's busiest airport - Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) in Delhi - is preparing for big expansion that will make it future ready. As per reports, the Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), a joint venture between GMR Group, Airports Authority of India (AAI), and others, is seeking environmental clearances to expand airport. The plan includes expanding the existing terminal used for domestic flights (terminal 1), building a new runway, and setting up of fourth terminal - terminal 4. The plan is expected to cost Rs 16,000 crore to DIAL. At present, IGIA has three runways and three terminals (out of which terminal 1 and terminal 3 are used).
The phased expansion will see the IGIA's capacity going up to 75 million by 2020, and further to 92 million by 2025, which is almost double to the total passengers - 55 million - handled by the airport last year. The plan also includes knocking down of Centaur Hotel and terminal 2 (after the expected expansion of terminal 1 in 2020).
Will the expansion of Delhi airport mean that passengers have to shell out more Experts say that passengers might have to pay extra fare to fund the DIAL's expansion plan, at least that's what the history suggests.
Soon after the Delhi airport was modernized, the government allowed the airport operator to charge passengers ADF (airport development fees) and UDF (user development fees) from both domestic and international passengers arriving and departing from the airport.
The ADF, started in 2009, was primarily meant to fund the capital expenditure incurred by DIAL to expand and modernize the airport. UDF, on the other hand, is charged for the maintenance of the airport. It includes providing ongoing facilities such as air-conditioning of terminals, staff expenses, cleaning costs, Wi-Fi services, among others.
While ADF charges were discontinued in 2015, the passengers still have to pay UDF. Currently, UDF charges at Delhi airport, ranging from Rs 250 to Rs 1500 per ticket, are one of the highest in the country. Surprisingly, UDF charges are standard for both terminals (terminal 1 and terminal 3) although the facilities available at these terminals vary widely.
The impending expansion is likely to increase the UDF charges further. That will not just translate into passengers spending more on tickets but can potentially make Delhi airport uncompetitive. Aviation consultancy CAPA says that Indian airports need to remain competitive if they wish to promote themselves as hubs. Analysis of the revenue generated by airport operators from landing charges and passenger fees reveals that some of India's metro airports are relatively expensive compared with major hubs in the region such as Singapore and Dubai.

French Army grooms eagles to down drones
FRANCE: Faced with the risk of drones being used to snoop or carry out attacks on French soil, the air force is showing its claws. At Mont-de-Marsan in southwestern France a quartet of fearsome golden eagles is being trained to take out unmanned aircraft in mid-flight.
The roar of a departing Rafale fighter jet gives way to the buzz of a drone lifting into the air on a runway at the air base, some 130 kilometres (80 miles) south of Bordeaux.
Suddenly, a loud squawk fills the air as a beady-eyed eagle bears down at breakneck speed from a control tower 200 metres away.
In about 20 seconds the raptor has the drone between its talons, then pins it to the ground and covers it with its broad brown wings.
The drone has been destroyed: Mission accomplished for D'Artagnan.
The valiant bird is one of four feathered fighters -- along with Athos, Porthos and Aramis, all characters in French novelist Alexandre Dumas's The Three Musketeers -- being put through their paces since mid-2016.
Mont-de-Marsan is one of five air bases in France to boast a falconry.
Usually, the birds of prey -- generally falcons or northern goshawks-- are kept to scare birds away from the runway to reduce the risk of accidents during takeoff or landing.
But with France on high alert after a string of jihadist assaults since January 2015, they are now sinking their beaks into national security.
The results are encouraging. The eagles are making good progress, said Commander Christophe, who heads the air safety squadron that is training the plumed predators.
Like all French military personnel, he offers only his first name and rank to journalists.
He says the birds are performing three to four months ahead of projections.
Police in The Netherlands were the first to come up with the idea of using raptors to intercept drones, inducting bald eagles into the service in late 2015.
The French army followed suit last year, but it opted for the golden eagle -- a natural-born killer with a hooked beak, amber eyes and a wingspan of up to 2.2 metres (seven feet).
Like all birds of prey, the golden eagle has excellent eyesight, capable of spotting its target from two kilometres away. At between three and five kilograms (11 pounds) it also happens to weigh about the same as most of the drones that could be used for nefarious purposes -- or that simply go astray. And an eagle is devastatingly fast, clocking 80 kilometres an hour as it swoops in for the kill.
Hatched in captivity, the four musketeers had their food served atop wrecked drones from the age of three weeks. Thanks to this technique, the birds very quickly began to seize remotely piloted aircraft for food.
So when drones buzz above, their hunting instinct kicks in, with falconer Gerald Machoukow rewarding every successful interception with a hunk of meat.
The birds begin with flights in a straight line, graduating to diving from a height. Soon they will be casting off from peaks in the nearby Pyrenees Mountains.
The buzz around the project is palpable. A first progress report is due in June, halfway through the 24-month test programme, but the initial feedback is positive. The cost is very low considering the job at hand, said Commander Laurent, listing strategic sites such as airports, or events such as summits and football tournaments, among those where the eagles could be deployed. - AFP

GMOA celebrates 90 years
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) celebrated its 90th Anniversary on February 18 with a pirith chanting ceremony at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo 7 with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The GMOA was inaugurated on October 16, 1926 in Kandy, attended by 16 medical officers. Initially, the Association was known as the Government Medical Officers Association (Central Province) and confined its activities to the province, although government medical officers of other provinces were also eligible for membership.
The association aims to safeguard the rights and privileges of its members. The first GMOA President was Dr. H. Ludovici and the Joint Secretaries were Dr. S. L. Navaratnam and Dr. I. A. Senanayake. The initial membership fee was Rs. 5 per year. Among the demands listed in the inaugural meeting are with regard to salaries, quarters and traveling allowances - the same issues that concern the membership even 75 years later.
In September 1927, the Association changed its scope renaming itself as the Government Medical Officers Association of Ceylon. Today, the GMOA is a potent force with a membership exceeding 16,000. The 90 branch unions function effectively at local level, coordinating with the centre.

Even the state media published false news items, Health Minister Dr. Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was addressing a media briefing held at the health ministry recently.
The minister said media personnel should check with Health Ministry officials before publishing such news. The person who signed the press release will be investigated. I have his details and he had taken money to publish the news item. This is shameful. Minister Senaratne said the GMOF had sent a letter to Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama requesting him to safeguard the good name of the Health Minister and conduct a comprehensive and an independent inquiry into the issue of State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC)'s current Managing Director's unethical and irregular practices<U+200B><U+200B>. This is purely aimed at disparaging the MD's character.
There is no such organisation at the given address; only a deserted house and the guard there said the owners live in the UK.
Senaratne said the persons who accused Dr. Rumie Mohamed<U+200B> are connected to a private company which lost a tender recently due to its corruption and malpractices. The company changed the name and re-registered as a new company under a new address after angaing in nifarious activities.
The owner of the company was in remand custody for six months. He had imported drugs from a place in India. There is a flower shop, not a drug company. He tried to import a drug for cancer at Rs. 170 million. `I stopped it and saved a large sum of money for the Health Ministry,' Senaratne said.

Go for glowing skin
Whether you want to look sweet and flirty or striking and romantic celebrate this month with flawless, glowing and radiant skin with these hair and make-up beauty tips to feel beautiful and confident.
These beauty tips will make you prettiest best. These simple skin care tips will turn this day into happy one.
Beauty expert Shahnaz Husain suggests toning of the skin with chilled rose water, using cotton wool pads.
Keep rose water in a bowl in the fridge with cotton wool pads soaking in them. First use them to wipe the skin. Then, stroke the skin with them. On the cheeks, use outward and upward movements, ending each stroke at the temples and applying gentle pressure. On the forehead, start from the centre and go outwards on each side, again ending at the temples. For the chin, use circular movements. Then, pat the skin briskly with the rosewater-soaked cotton wool pads, Hussain says.
She further states that a pick-me-up face mask can leave your skin clean and glowing.
Mix honey with egg white and apply it on the face. Wash off with water after 20 minutes. For those with very dry skin, mix honey with egg yolk and a little milk. Leave on for 20 minutes. Rinse off with water. After washing off the pack, give the skin a compress with the rose water soaked cotton wool pads, Husain suggests.
She advocates the use of a facial scrub as well.
It can work wonders on the skin, helping to remove dead skin cells and making the skin brighter. Make a facial scrub with walnut powder and one teaspoon each honey and curd. Apply the mixture on the face and leave on for a few minutes. Then, rub gently, with small circular movements, washing off with water, Hussain adds.
Dried and powdered curry leaves (Kari Patta) can also be added to face packs, as it is said to add a glow to the skin. It can be mixed with two teaspoon oats or wheat bran (choker), two teaspoons rose water and one teaspoon yogurt. It should be a paste that does not drip. Apply on face, avoiding the lips and area around eyes. Wash it off after 20 to 30 minutes.
Fruit packs are great for adding radiance to the skin. They can also be applied daily. Mix grated apples with ripe papaya pulp and mashed banana. Yogurt or lemon juice can be added to the mixture. Apply it on the face and leave it on for half an hour. Wash off with plain water. It not only adds a glow, but also removes tan and softens the skin, suggests Shahnaz Husain
For oily skin, she says mix Multani Mitti with rose water into a paste and apply it on the face, avoiding the lips and area around eyes. Wash it off when it is dry. For combination skin, apply the mask on oily areas of the skin.
For normal skin: Mix multani mitti with honey and yogurt into a paste. Apply on the face and wash it off after 20 to 30 minutes.
An ideal way for glowing skin on the body is to tie ingredients in a clean cloth, wet slightly and then rub the cloth bag on the skin while bathing. Mix powdered milk, ground almonds (badaam), rice powder and rose petals. The ingredients work on your skin, gently cleansing it and leaving it soft, smooth and vibrant. It also leaves the body naturally perfumed and refreshed, feeling as smooth as silk, suggests Husain. ANI

Government to make rice prices stable: Badiudeen
The government will contain rice prices, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen said yesterday.
The ministrys Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) conducted more than 3000 raids over a month and has instituted legal action against 1,200 errant traders, among them millers, stockholders and retailers who sold rice to consumers at exorbitant rates overriding prices set by the government.
The minister was speaking at a press conference at the Government Information Department.
He said: There are enough rice stocks in the market. Stockholders in Pettah are selling rice at reasonable prices. There is no need for the retailers to sell rice at exorbitant costs to consumers in violation of rice prices set by the government.
Besides, he said, the investigators of the Consumer Affairs Authority are at the ready to nab errant traders who sell rice to the public overriding prices laid down by the government.
I request the public to inform the CAA of places where they may be selling rice at exorbitant rates. Phone the Authority on 1977 and lodge your complaint with it. The line will be open from 7 am to 10 pm throughout the week, he said. People are welcome to inform us of places where stockholders or rice millers have hidden their stocks. Rice is an essential commodity, he said.
He said price displaying too is a matter of concern. All retailers must display unit prices of their rice varieties, he said.
The maximum retail price of a kilo of imported Nadu has been set at Rs. 72, a kilo of local Nadu at Rs. 80, imported Kekulu at Rs. 70, Local Kekulu at Rs. 78, imported Samba at Rs. 80 and a kilo of Local Samba rice has been set at Rs. 90, the minister said.
The public can purchase rice at these rates from Lanka Sathosa outlets and supermarkets without restrictions, he said.
Maximum retail prices for local rice varieties have been gazetted with the consent of rice millers, stockholders and farmers on Friday. The retail price caps were decided by a cabinet Sub-committee appointed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The committee comprised Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayaka, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Badiudeen, Minister Malik Samarawickrema and Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama among other ministers.
We reduced the tax on imported rice to Rs. five to give relief to the public. Rice millers and importers agreed that they can sell rice to retailers so that the latter can sell them at rates set by us, Minister Badiudeen said.

Immediate steps to revoke licenses
In the wake of the boat tragedy in Katukurunda on Sunday which claimed 11 lives, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday ordered relevant officials to take immediate steps to revoke licenses issued to fishing vessels which transport passengers while violating guidelines issued by the ministry.
Amaraweera said the ill-fated vessel was a multi-day fishing boat with a capability to carry four or five fishermen plus the fishing gear, but it had carried 30 plus passengers, far exceeding its capacity.
The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry will launch an awareness program among boat owners and boatmen regarding safety standards to be adopted and maintained in navigating boats in high seas to prevent tragedies like Sundays boat tragedy, Minister Amaraweera added.
The ministry will seek the assistance of the Navy and the National Coast Conservation Department, and other relevant institutions to organize this programme. The minister in a release added that even though this area did not come under the ministry purview, it hoped to issue a set of guidelines to institutions and persons providing boat services as a social service so that tragedies of this nature could be avoided.
The minister said it was clear that overloading was the main cause of the Katukurunda boat tragedy.

Investment in knowledge
Knowledge has become the driving force of economic performance and hence knowledge production has become a necessary condition for improving national competitiveness in a globalized world. The term higher education usually encompasses university education as well as other branches of tertiary professional and technical education. University education, which in Sri Lanka dominates higher education. Countrys higher education has to be continuously upgraded as new technology especially information technology is incorporated and at a time of immense economic changes are taking place in global landscape.
Universities perform three main functions, teaching, research and public service. The three functions are interrelated. Leadership in higher education needs proper culmination of teaching, research and public service. Therefore, the new era of higher education need to reposition in a manner where the ultimate benefits could be reaped by the student community efficiently and effectively.
Challenges in higher education
Challenges have been identified as massification, privatization, and internationalization  in higher education. Each country wishes to deploy its resources in higher education to greatest advantage  to increase national competitiveness; enhance its economic growth rates; and raise its prestige internationally, while Sri Lanka lags behind. Privatization has affected the formation and the administration of higher education institutions globally. It enhanced the competitive advantage in terms of quality and service delivery. Further, usage of digital technology and expansion of online mode to the rural sector, lack of usage of knowledge management techniques in administration of higher education, development of skills, attitudes and aptitudes of students, lack of a proper counselling and mentoring mechanism are some of the other issues we face in higher education.
The emergence of knowledge economies encouraged investment in higher education and research to promote industrial and technological competitiveness. The move towards establishing research universities, world class universities and the development of university ranking systems are instances of higher education becoming dear to the public sector and also to the corporate world. These efforts have helped revitalizing higher education in the present century.
The University Grants Commission (UGC) is mandated only to regulate, foster and monitor state universities/higher educational institutions. There is indeed a serious void in authority and procedures in formulating policy and regulatory framework and guidelines that will facilitate and expedite expansion of the higher education sector as a whole, together with monitoring operational aspects of the non-state higher education sector that includes private higher educational institutes, cross-border institutes, professional bodies awarding degrees/diplomas and branch campuses of foreign universities.
Apart from this a vast range of programmes offered by providers of many different types. The legitimacy and the technical capacity of many providers to conduct academic training and offer diplomas/degrees are not very apparent. All of them however, operate in the absence of any regulation and monitoring. Lack of such State regulation and monitoring of this non-formal sector is the major impediment to expansion of this important sector.
For this purpose it is proposed to establish an independent Quality Assurance and Accreditation Framework in Sri Lanka to ensure confidence in its awards.
Develop curricula utilizing digital technologies can aid in improving students motivation and learning. All countries now compete in a global, knowledge-based, innovation-centred economy. For Asian nations to compete in this situation, students educational outcomes should include motivation (both intrinsic interest and self-efficacy), academic achievement (content and skill acquisition), 21st century skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and character attributes such as persistence and flexibility.
The largest obstacle is preparing a sufficient supply of high quality teachers who understand their subject, how students learn, and the role of digital tools and media in aiding learning. Powerful models for online and blended teacher professional development need to be available.
However, we have not made extensive investments in educational technology infrastructure, nor have emphasized using technology as a means of moving away from teaching by telling and learning by listening. Overall, realizing the full potential of economic and social wellbeing involves not only bringing all of each countrys population up to a foundational level of skills and knowledge, but also enabling some fraction of students to compete in the global economy by mastering sophisticated knowledge and skills: cognitive, intrapersonal, and interpersonal. Modern digital technologies provide powerful strategies for learning that can accomplish both these goals.
Administration of higher education
The administration of higher education needs due recognition without any political or any form of interferences to deliver the public service efficiently and effectively. Further, enhancing knowledge management in administration of higher education institutes are of paramount importance of the hour. Management information systems need to be part of the administration. Pressing concerns of the Administration of Higher education institutes need to be addressed since the university system cannot merely function without proper administration. It should be independent and need to be well recognized.
In Singapore they built a multicultural society that would give equality to all citizens regardless of race, language or religion. It is the faith which guided their policies. How difficult it was for a small country of 640sq. km., with no natural resources to survive in the midst of larger, newly independent nations pursuing nationalistic policies.
It was hard work, planning and focused mission led to build a nation out of a desperate collection of immigrants from China, British, India and Dutch making a living to all the people. Higher education played a major role in Singapore introducing economically benefitted degree programmes to the society.
Develop skills, attitudes and aptitudes of students
Develop skills, attitude and aptitudes of students that enhance their employability is needed than just obtaining a paper qualification. One of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals for Education (UNSDG) speaks to skills specific to sustainable development in the 21st century.
Pedagogic recontextualization, the ability of critical thinking to speak to alternative possibilities and individual autonomy in higher education is essential.
New perspectives from leaders in academic affairs, student affairs and central administration to improve institutes and universities in service to students and professionals are needed. Leadership norms, values, assumptions and behaviours can often find their origins in cultural identities, and how such assumptions can affect the evolvement of universities in serving student community creating multicultural citizen in a democratic country is a challenge with the existing higher education system.
There are various challenges and barriers to be overcome to realize the vision of the higher education in Sri Lanka.
Banking and insurance industry as well as the Chambers could well look after the education and the health sector of this country rather than being a burden to the State in funding. The sector has become dearer to public policy and private investment and it enjoys favourable public support, increased investment especially from non-government sources, diversified provisions, and programmes and experienced unprecedented expansion globally.
More and more countries are showing less and less reliance on public funding support to expand higher education. Further, public - private partnerships in higher education need to be outcome oriented and the student community should be benefitted.
There is a dire need of policy formulation in higher education amidst changing social, cultural, economical global landscape and challenges.
More than anything else, building the faith among the public in the higher education in Sri Lanka is the need of the hour since there is a huge brain drain at present.

Japan border entry inspection stricter for students from 5 countries including Sri Lanka

Japan's immigration authority has told several Japanese language schools that students from China, Vietnam, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka will meet stricter incoming inspection standards to avoid illegal stays, a China daily reported today.
The policy will go into effect next month.
The students are now required to offer new financial evidence, such as detailed bank account information including copies of bankbooks.
There are many students from the five countries, and the number of illegal stays is increasing. We have heard of students illegally working in Japan, said a Justice Ministry official.
According to reports, South Korean people make up the largest group in that demographic that has been staying in Japan illegally, with the number coming in at about 13,000 in 2015.
That group is followed by those from the Chinese mainland (8700), Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam. Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka were not on the top-ten list.
Foreign students who would like to study in Japan need to study at a language school for half a year. After that, they can apply to a university, and after that they can apply for a student visa.
In Vietnam and Myanmar, it is very difficult to make students prepare new commercial certificates. The chaos in expanding", said an employee of a language school in Japan.
Japan started a G30project in 2008 to attract foreign students to study at Japan's universities, aiming to have 300,000 foreign students before 2020.
The project resulted in an increase in the numbers of language schools in Japan. For example, in Kyushu, there were 64 Japanese language schools as of September of last year, twice the number of ten years ago.

Lanka can be emerging shipping, trading centre in the region - Chinese envoy
The development of Hambantota Port and Hambantota Industrial Zone, currently carried out with the assistance of China will attract nearly five billion dollars FDI and create over 100,000 jobs for Sri Lankans within the next 3 to 5 years China's Ambassador to Sri Lanka Yi Xianliang said.
Xianliang also predicted that Sri Lanka one day will become the merging shipping and trading centre in the region which is the Sri Lankan Government's blueprinted in the economic policy statement.
He made these remarks at the Sujata Jayawardena Memorial Oration, organised by the Alumni Association of the Colombo University. The Memorial Oration was conducted under the theme One Belt One Road Initiative and China -Sri Lanka Relation under the Initiative of OBOR.
Eminent personalities in the caliber of Thilak Karunaratna, Rajeev Amarasuriya, Prof. Lakshman Dissanayake, Prof. Nayani Melegoda were present.
Ambassador Yi Xianliang said up to now China has provided more than RMB 10 billion (over Rs. 200 billion) donations to Sri Lanka and granted nearly 12,000 trainee ships and scholarships to Sri Lankan youth.
During the past 12 months of last year, we provided over 1000 scholarships and training opportunities to your youth for academic studies, language trainings and for professional training,
Talking on the basic concept and thoughts in terms of OBOR initiative, he said the Marine Time Silk Road will one day make Sri Lanka an important hub between Dubai and Singapore.
The concept of Maritime Silk Road is in line with the development strategy of Sri Lanka, proposed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Even during my visit to Indonesia in October 2013, our President Xi Jinping called for joint development of a Maritime Silk Road of the 21st Century,.
The Maritime Silk Road is part of the OBOR initiative and a major framework that China has made to deepen reform and opening-up and advance its neighbourhood diplomacy.
Nearly 2,000 years ago, people of Asia began to travel to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and coastal Asian countries through the sea lanes in the west Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. It gradually developed into a maritime trade route connecting countries across Asia, Europe and Africa,.

He said China would like to push forward bilateral cooperation with Sri Lanka under the framework of OBOR, give consideration to each other's own national development strategy, while strengthening support for each other.At present, bilateral relations are on the track and we are willing to work together with Sri Lanka in the years to come.

Lanka shines at Surajkund international crafts mela
February brings, not only the call of the north wind; but borne on its wings comes the call from the lord of the arts, executor of a thousand handicrafts, the carpenter of the gods, the fashioner of all ornaments, the most eminent of artisans, the father and generator on whose craft men subsist, a great and immortal god: Viswakarma.
It brings with it historical and creative significance; and along with it, cold weather and seasonal change in the Northern hemisphere.For February is the month of the worlds largest Crafts Exhibition and Trade Fair, held in Surajkund in Haryana, near the city of Faridabad. Each year, as spring begins to dawn, and the chill of Delhi commence to fade, this little Lake of the Sun (literal meaning of Surajkund) comes alive.
The vibrance of India when it comes to show casing its crafts is understandable. Indian mythology gave the world the great architect of the universe, Vishwakarma,the progenitor of all crafts and trade in crafts. From February 1 to 15, year on year, the cosmic world of crafts comes alive in Surakjund, a hamlet sitting in the base of the Aravalli hill ranges, in the proximity of Delhi, believed to be peopled from stone age.
This year is the 31st consecutive year of the festival since its inception in 1987. The festival gains strength by the year, nurtured with care and concern by the Government of Haryana, Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs. A set of devoted officials who spare no effort to make the event matchless in its excellence, gives the festival life. Worthy of mention amongst such officials are joint General Managers M.Malik, Bilawar Singh, Rajesh Joon, Sabarwal, Wilfred D Souza, Mukesh Rao and officers assisting.
Over a thousand crafts persons from all over India and from twenty-eight other nations of the world took part this year in a mood of fun, frolic, entertainment; offering an exclusive shopping experience to be found nowhere else in the world. The finest handlooms, handicrafts, authentic fragrances, and flavours of rich Indian cuisines, and that of other countries, are there for all to savour and shop. In an alluring and enchanting rural ambience, craftsperson, including from Sri Lanka, display and demonstrate their finest, traditional, crafts-work that is set to capture the hearts and minds of visitors.
This year was the 10th consecutive year since Sri Lanka first took part in the exhibition, thanks to the efforts of the former Chairman of the National Crafts Council, Buddhi Keerthisena. For the first time, in 2008, a small contingent from Sri Lanka took part in the craft festival at Surajkund on an invitation extended, by the SAARC division in the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India, through the office of the High Commissioner for India in Colombo, and facilitated by the National Crafts Council of Sri Lanka. Since then, the Sri Lankan contingent has grown from strength to strength.
Dr.Buddhi Keerthisena President of Hands of Sri Lanka National Crafts Foundation and National Crafts Council Chairperson Heshani Bogollagama participated at the Mela 2017.
This year, apart from a contingent from the National Crafts Council of Sri Lanka; for the first time an invitation was extended to Hands of Sri Lanka,The National Arts and Crafts Foundation of Sri Lanka to send a group of crafts persons to Surajkund by the Festival Authorities on the recommendation of the Indian High Commission in Colombo.
The vision of the National Arts and Crafts Foundation is to establish a permanent platform to project to the world the incredible heritage of the crafts of Sri Lanka.
In addition, to inspire present and future generations of crafts persons in Sri Lanka to protect, preserve, and give life to their intangible cultural traditions through a process of revitalising and uplifting their standards of living; and safeguard and fortify sustained development. In recognition of its efforts, the invitation extended to participate.
The special feature at Surajkund is that, all foreign invitees, including crafts persons, cultural troupes, officials, are hosted by the Haryana Government. The government and officials spare no effort to make the visitors comfortable and at home.
This festival at Surajkund, whilst providing a comforting sense of tradition within the context of modernity; also decisively improves the economic, technical, and social infrastructure available to artisans and speed their access to entrepreneurship and markets. Further, it preserves, educates, and acts as a source of pleasure and inspiration to the crafts persons and the people visiting the venue.

Lawyers for Democracy justifies appointment of Kannan as HC Judge
Lawyers for Democracy yesterday in a statement justified the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court Judge by President Maithripala Sirisena.
In the statement, the Lawyers for Democracy said that there had been several appointments of private practitioners to the High Court from 1974 onwards. The Lawyers for Democracy are of the
view that the due process had been followed in this instance. Following is the full statement.
We have carefully followed the public debate on the appointment of Ramanathan Kannan as a High Court Judge, particularly the exchange of communications and statements made by various groups and politicians. We are of the opinion that all parties must act with responsibility on this appointment. Having examined the facts we wish to state the following:
1. Appointments to higher courts have not been limited to career judges in democracies including in Sri Lankan. It is a healthy practice to appoint as judges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Courts from and among the career judges, and suitable individuals from the official and unofficial bar.
There have been several appointments of private practitioners to the High Court from 1974 onwards, one of the recent appointments being that of Mr. Paramarajah during Chief Justice Sarath Silvas tenure of office, one of the reasons being the lack of Tamil-speaking judges as is the case of Mr. Kannans appointment.
2. Following the traditions, upon a nomination by the President of the Bar Association, Kannans name has been proposed to President who had then referred same to the Chief Justice for the concurrence of the Judicial Service Commission. Upon the relevant recommendation from the Attorney General, the JSC had, on January 5,2017, given its concurrence. Kannan had been in the official bar for a considerable period before reverting to an active private practice.
3. During the tenure of the present President Maithripala Sirisena and the present Chief Justice, 23 individuals have been appointed to the High Court of which as much as 21 had been from and among the District Court judges. Only one appointment each has been made from official and unofficial bar.
4. In our view, when appointing a practicing lawyer to the higher judiciary, views should be obtained only from the President of the Bar Association and not from its committees such as the Bar Council or the Executive Committee. If the whole Bar Council or the Executive Committee is involved there will be canvassing and open debate, compromising the nominees independence. The practice has always been for the President of the Bar Association to make such recommendations, whenever suitable candidates are proposed.
5. It is unfortunate that insinuations are made by politicians that Mr. Kannnan had been proposed by a political party. We have made inquiries and are satisfied that there is no truth in these allegations. We also understand that, contrary to claims, Kannan has never applied to join the judiciary earlier.
6. We are disturbed by the irresponsible reaction of the Judicial Services Association by going to the extent of making public statements and boycotting their support for the Bar Association in conducting its annual elections. Such decisions will go against the healthy relationship between the Bar Association of Sri Lanka and the Judges of the minor judiciary. Such actions will also undermine the independence of the judiciary.
In view of the above, we urge the public not be mislead by false statements made by interested parties. We also urge the members of the Judges Association representing minor judiciaryto act with responsibility.
Lal Wijenayaka, K.S. Ratnavale and JC Weliamuna, the Conveners on behalf of Lawyers for Democracy.

That little blighter in a diaper is a love sniper!
Tuesday the 14 was V-Day. And the cash registers have been jingling incessantly throughout the whole of the last few weeks. For days tainted by commercialism Valentines Day gives even Christmas a run for its money - big money. It is heralded with a superfluity of marketing initiatives by cunning companies to cash in on the general emotional cupidity and stupidity on display.
That is why on V-Day you observe a great deal of people walking around feeling light-headed and full of love. Yes siree, Stupid Cupids arrows seem to be sending everyone quivering into a trance in romance.
The greeting card industry, florists, jewellers, confectioners and restaurateurs rake in over a billion bucks during V-Day every year. Now, do not get me wrong, I am not against romance. I think romance is an important part of the man-woman relationship. Yet, throughout the years I have found that there are many different types of romance, and it doesnt necessarily involve flowers, chocolates and lacy heart-shaped cards.
Often it appears in the smallest of actions and in the simple, quiet moments of everyday life. I would choose comfort, security and old-fashioned loving devotion over wildly romantic encounters any day of the week. All you florists, confectioners, perfume dealers and card vendors are welcome to send your hate-mail to me.
But before that cherubic, chubby imp starts hitching up his diapers, ruffling his wings and stringing his bow, it would be a good idea to get ready to run. That is because Cupids arrows have been known to have caused mischief and mayhem from the time his darts drove Daphne away from Apollo.
lethal weapons
Yes, Stupid Cupid often gets it wrong. It seems pretty obvious that the little blighter in a diaper has a capricious disposition and I suspect a malicious streak as well. His arrows are lethal weapons to the lovelorn and he sometimes uses them willy-nilly. In this day and age he terrorises a good many hearts.
The rascally son of Venus could bar adults - and by adults I mean parents and teachers - from making children swap Valentines. What the heck are they trying to do with these very small kids anyway Aiming to churn out whole generations of Valen-tinies,I guess.
Besides, think about some of the incurably romantic oldsters They would be spared a world of grief when they are pierced broadside and the feelings are un-mutually one-sided. Sometimes plot does not always race at a pace that suggests love is just about the only force that keeps the universe moving with ever-palpitating geriatric hearts.
But then again the arrow picked from his frivolous quiver may not be the appropriate one. To be sure the missile does not always keep to the straight and narrow. It flies awry often. To add to the confusion the arch little archer does not always hit dead centre.
All the while, many of us are ducking and dodging the arrows from the sniping scallywags bow. Personally, I think this urchin dressed only in a diaper, flying around blindfolded and shooting arrows at folks, is just plain dangerous. Oh sure, it may seem like fun and games, until somebody gets an eye or both eyes put out!
hackneyed clich
And then everybody invariably spews out the hackneyed clich that love is blind. Philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche appeared dead on target when he weighed in with this twist on the old so ugly joke with: A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.
For example, Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher and bon vivant, let it rip from the hip when he said: Love is a serious mental disease. But for true V-Day Day cynicism, you have got to go straight to the early 19th century American man of letters, H. L. Mencken who said: Love is the triumph of imagination over intelligence, adding: Love is like war, easy to begin but very hard to stop.
Satire columns
And ouch! Theres this witty love tap from British writer W. Somerset Maugham: Love is only a dirty trick played on us to achieve continuation of the species. Mencken, Maugham and Nietzsche, these are gentlemen who, history has shown, did not do particularly well on Valentines Day. But closer home there was myold friend and former schoolmate nicknamed Surchepps, who I have deservingly immortalised in many of my satire columns.
He was an inveterate punster and a darned good one at that. As an alumni of St. Bens he had a sort of paradoxical rivalry with a pretty, witty Shepherdian, in the convent next door. Her name was Mercy, although she never lived up to her name when crossing swords in any verbal battle.
Surchepps conceded that Mercy was his most worthy and versatile opponent when it came to the art of repartee. At a social gathering once we matched Surchepps with Mercy in a fun debate on love that called for insults in rhyming couplets. I was voted unanimously as moderator and set out the rules which decidedly forbade profanity of any kind. Surchepps won the coin toss and fired the first volley: Of loving beauty you float with grace. If only you would hide your face. Mercy returned fire: I want to feel your sweet embrace. But leave that paper bag on your face.
And so the battle went into a full-scale punny rhythmic war. Surchepps: Kind, intelligent, loving and hot. This describes what you are not! Mercy: I like your smile, your face, your eyes. And Im really good at telling lies. Surchepps: Violets are blue, roses are red. I hate your guts and I wish you were dead! Mercy: I see your face when I am dreaming. Thats why I always wake up screaming!
As moderator I had to step in and cry halt to the debate when I observed it was going too far. Surchepps: My feelings for you no words can tell. Except for maybe go to hell! Mercy: Violets are blue, roses are red. Shame, your backside is the size of a shed!
Happy belated Valentines Day everybody!

Lufthansa agrees pay deal with pilot union
Lufthansa has struck a deal to solve a five-year-long dispute with pilots that has cost it millions of euros. Germany's largest airline and the Cockpit union have agreed upon an arbitrator's proposal for a new wage agreement that covers about 5,400 pilots.
The firm has agreed to a four-stage 8.7% total wage increase and a one-off 30m-euro (25.5m) payment. That works out at some 5,000 euros to 6,000 euros per employee.
Cockpit union spokesman Markus Wahl said although union negotiators had agreed upon the deal, its members would have the final say on whether to accept. The dispute has seen pilots take part in 15 strikes.
The union had wanted an average annual pay rise of 3.7% for its members in Germany, backdated to 2012. Despite a record profit last year, the company said it had been forced to cut costs to compete with budget rivals such as Ryanair in Europe and the likes of Emirates on long-haul routes. (BBC)

Moves to redress Kurunegala North water woes
The foundation stone for the Deduru Oya Water Supply Project was laid by City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem, Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chang Won-sam and other dignitaries yesterday.
The project is supported by the Export-Import Bank of Korea (Korea Eximbank) to provide clean and safe drinking water to the people in Mahawa and Polpithigama divisions in the Northern part of Kurunegala district as these areas are affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
The rapid spread of CKD is a huge problem in Sri Lanka while the Kurunegala district has been identified by health authorities as a severely affected area. The main reason for the spread of CKD is the consumption of unsafe ground water due to the lack of pipe borne water in the Kurunegala district.
The government aims to take measures to address the prevalence of CKD under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
To prevent this debilitating disease, Korea Eximbank expects to provide safe drinking water for residents in Mahawa and Polpithigama Divisional Secretarys divisions in the Kurunegala North district. Through this project, pipe borne water will be provided to 18,200 households benefiting 90,800 residents.
The scope of this project includes building comprehensive water supply facilities such as intake structure, water treatment plant, transmission lines, storage reservoirs and distribution network.
Institutional capacities will be developed to ensure sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of these facilities.
Upon successful project completion in mid-2019, Korea Eximbank expects to contribute towards decreasing the incidence of CKD and water-borne diseases and improve the health environment and living conditions in the region.

## Title: MR and independence of the judiciary
## Supertitle:

MR and independence of the judiciary
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has joined the chorus of his Joint Opposition cohorts in criticising the appointment of a High Court Judge by the Yahapalanaya government in what he calls a move to appease its political allies. He goes on to state that it is essential to abide by the accepted practise in making judicial appointments to safeguard the INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY (emphasis ours).
Rajapaksa is the last person who can speak about the independence of the judiciary, after making not just the Judiciary, but also the Attorney General's Department, a malleable tool in his hands. The AG's Department was prevailed upon to close the cases of wrong doers who had switched their allegiance to the Rajapaksas after deserting the UNP. A self confessed rapist was allowed to go scott-free after switching sides while another - a former Deputy Minister from the Colombo District- charged for murder had his case summarily withdrawn at the instance of the powers that be.
Rajapaksa also should be careful when he espouses the cause of an independent judiciary because his record in this connection is bound to come under scrutiny and he will only be opening a can of worms. The whole sordid saga involving former Chief Justice Dr. Shirani Bandanayake is still fresh in the minds of the public. They are aware that, but for the adverse verdict given in connection of the Divi Neguma Bill, Dr. Bandaranayake would have continued to remain as CJ. She was subjected to impeachment only because she exercised HER judicial independence and struck down the Bill that gave unlimited powers to a Rajapaksa sibling to handle billions of rupees bypassing parliament.
When Rajapaksa talks of Independence of the Judiciary he must mean independence in the true sense of the word. But the former President appointed the husband of the self same Shirani Bandaranayke to an important government post while the latter remained the CJ. How will his present espousal of an independent judiciary juxtapose with his act of appointing the spouse of the country's Chief Justice to a high profile government post that is bound to colour judgements in the government's favour, although we are here not suggesting that Dr. Bandaranayake would have been so influenced, a fact borne out by her Divi Neguma judgement.
Rajapaksa has also taken exception to the manner in which his choice of Chief Justice Mohan Peiris was removed from office, which he contents was by Presidential fiat that was unconstitutional rather than through the legislative process. While conceding that the laid down procedure to oust Dr. Bandaranayake was followed, what actually took place was a travesty, with the former CJ being subjected to humiliation trough a mock trial with handpicked Rajapaksa acolytes forming themselves into a Parliamentary Select Committee that was in fact a Kangaroo Court. Not only that, the ousted Chief Justice was subjected to further indignities and humiliation with government sponsored mobs armed with loud speakers taking position outside the official bungalow of the CJ to hurl abuse and invective at a female judge.
President Sirisena, the other day, made a public revelation on how the former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris approached him, not once, but twice, with a pledge to enter judgements at the behest of the President and that he (President) was compelled to show the door to the supplicant in order to protect the independence of the judiciary. President Sirisena who made the same charge at the beginning of his Presidency has so far not been challenged on this score and it is only logical to assume that this unethical approach was indeed made by Peiris.
Going by this logic it is only too obvious how the self same Mohan Peiris acted at the behest of the former President in his judgements and the hypocrisy of Rajapaksa in now espousing the cause of an independent judiciary.
Last, but not the least, the whole country was agog with the news of an attempted coup by Rajapaksa to remain in power on election night while the results were trickling in to show the former President was doomed. It was also said that he was in the company of his inner coterie planning a way out of the disaster. When the then Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe went to Temple Trees the same night, who was he to behold among this inner circle, plotting and planning for Rajapaksa to stay put, but the country's Chief Justice.
It is difficult to comprehend how a Chief Justice, who was among the conspirators, finding a way to keep the then President in office, despite the results, could ever be independent. It was also well known how the former President dangled plum appointments before Supreme Court judges to obtain favourable judgements. One Supreme Court judge in fact was appointed as High Commissioner to London while another Judge- a former Chief Justice, no less, ended up as an Advisor to the former President. Not quite the conduct of Rajapaksa that would have inspired people on the independence of the judiciary, for which he has now taken up cudgels.

Natural disasters: Government proved detractors wrong - PM
When natural disasters such as the Aranayake landslide occurred amidst the economic problems faced by the country, some people though that the government is incapable of facing such situations. But, the government proved its detractors wrong by finding the necessary funds and attending to the needs of the people, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after opening the Rhino housing scheme to house people displaced in the Aranayake landslide on February 19.
Wickemesinghe said the Rhino institution had build 20 houses at Wasanthagama, Aranayake at a cost of Rs. 50 million to house people displaced in the Aranayake landslide. He thanked the Managing Director of the Rhino Institution Jayaseelam Gnanam and his staff for their munificence in gifting the housing scheme.
Apart from Rhino, several other government and non government institutions had come forward to build houses for the displaced people while the government too had provided funding to complete other requirements.
The Prime Minister recalled that when the landslide occurred, he toured the area in a helicopter accompanied by Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa to inspect the devastation first hand. He understood that the houses washed away were strong edifices and not wattle and daub houses. The new houses had been built according to the same if not better standards of the houses that were destroyed.
President Maithripala Sirisena too took great pains to provide relief to the people affected by the landslide while Minister Yapa also accomplished a great amount of work towards helping the affected families. The major contribution made in this direction by Minister Yapa was little known because he was not a publicity hunter, said the Prime Minister.
Now the government had succeeded in providing houses to a majority of affected families almost after a lapse of one year after the calamity. This disaster occurred a few days prior to Vesak Poya last year. The government would be able to bring back to normalcy the entire village before Vesak Poya this year.
The redeveloped village can be considered a world record because visually restoration of a devastated village anywhere in the world would take two to three years the least. When Hurricane Catrina devastated New Orleans in the United Stated, the houses could not be rebuilt even after a lapse of 5 years after the disaster, he said.
The Prime Minister said the two Cabinet Ministers representing the area also worked with great self sacrifice to help those affected while former Parliamentarians Lalith Dissanayake and Nimal Jayasinghe too took an active part in coming to the assistance of the affected families.
The politicians and government servants too assisted by working in unison eschewing political and other rivalries. They would not have been able to make this achievement if they were disunited.
This was clear proof that any task or accomplishment was not beyond their means if both parties worked in unity, he said.
The Prime Minister said the countrys economy too crashed during the past war period due to the disunity of the people. This led to several major crises. That was why the UNP, and the Civil society through created a change in league with several other parties, when they realised the gravity of the economic crisis.
The Prime Minister said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa went for an election two years before schedule due to his inability to resolve the looming economic crisis. The Prime Minister said at first they got a mandate to work under President Maithripala Sirisena.
The General Election which followed give an opportunity to the UNP and the SLFP to think anew. They are now trying to steer the country forward by setting up a good governance government.
The Prime Minister said finding a lasting solution to the ethnic problem was the biggest challenge before them. Meanwhile, they had to cope with cases filed in the international fora.
Their first duty had been accomplished by uniting the people. This unity had given them strength to talk to the international world with one voice.

NDBIB retains market leader position in listed debentures
NDB Investment Bank Limited (NDBIB) reaffirmed its supremacy in the capital market by successfully raising a total of LKR 31.5 Billion through listed debentures during 2016 as sole manager to the issue and jointly. From this amount LKR 19.0 Billion was raised for Commercial Banks, LKR 10.5 Billion for Finance Companies and LKR 2.0 Billion for Corporates.
As in 2015, NDBIB once again posted an unmatched market share of approximately 38% in listed debenture issues during the year 2016, maintaining its market leadership position. NDBIB has the largest cumulative market share (38%) of all the listed debenture issues to date since the introduction of tax incentives in 2013 by the Government to develop the capital markets.
Furthermore, for its superior execution of transactions in both debt, equity and corporate advisory space, NDBIB was crowned as Sri Lankas Best Investment Bank 2016for the fifth consecutive year by Euromoney, the worlds premier financial markets magazine, bearing ample testimony to NDBIBs continuous quest for excellence and innovation within the investment banking sphere in the country. NDBIB is honoured to be the only investment bank in Sri Lanka to have achieved this feat.
Commenting on market leadership of NDBIB, DarshanPerera, CEO of NDBIB stated We are extremely proud to have continued our leadership position in managing listed debenture issues from 2015 to 2016. We are steadfastly committed to strive for excellence and innovation thereby adding value to our clients and propelling the countrys capital markets to the international pedestal. The economic growth and prospects of the country will naturally call for best-in-class knowledge and practices in our capital markets in order to cater to the growing needs. He also added that in the investment banking sphere all the players thrive to win a coveted award from a prestigious institution and NDBIB has reached this pinnacle five times consecutively.
Kaushini Laksumanage, Chief Operating Officer of NDBIB mentioned, It is indeed a proud achievement for us at NDBIB to be the number one investment bank in the country in managing listed debenture issues during 2016, particularly when considering the volatility that prevailed in the capital markets during this period. Adaptability and innovation are critical success factors in the dynamic financial services spectrum and hence these achievements provide ample evidence of the success achieved by NDBIB in its quest for continuous improvement. I am confident that these achievements would motivate the NDBIB team and inspire us to achieve greater heights.
It is expected that there will be a decline in the issuance of listed debt securities going forward due to the removal of tax incentives previously offered to these products, through the Budget 2017.

New hope to control Chronic Kidney Disease
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) in Sri Lanka has been a major public health problem and receiving increased global attention because of a significant increase in the prevalence of the disease. The term unknown etiology is referred, because the disease is not associated with any known risk factors such as aging, diabetes, hypertension, and nephrotoxic drug usage but suspected to be environmental causes.
As the CKDu occurs in settlements where groundwater is the main drinking water source, several risk factors had been hypothesized. The major factors that considered for CKD causes were environmental toxins, heavy metals (e.g., Cd, Pb), Fluoride (F), Aluminum (Al), and aluminofluoride (AlFx) complexes in water. But, none of the hypothesis had been scientifically proven and hence a definite cause for CKDu is yet to be revealed.
CKDu-affected areas
While working on CKDu research, I noticed that even among high-CKDu prevalence areas, there are small areas or villages that had not been affected by the disease. In these areas, the water source and quality were distinctly different from the CKDu-affected areas. Therefore, NIFS, under the Ministry of Science, Technology and Research took an initiative to systematically examine the quality of potable water in these locations to assess possible relationships between water quality and the occurrence of CKDu.
The research team at NIFS led by me tested all potable water for common contaminants such as fluoride and metal species Al, Cd, As, Ca and Mg that had previously been considered to be the main external etiological factors of CKDu disease.
Accordingly the NIFS researchers initiated a systematic monitoring programmes of water quality from the sources which used by the CKDu patients regularly. For these investigations, areas which were already identified by WHO as high-risk CKDu regions were further divided into three sub zones according to CKDu prevalence; high-CKDu prevalence areas where the majority of the people living in the region were affected by the disease (Zone I), low-CKDu-prevalence areas where the majority of the people living in the region were not affected by the disease (Zone II); CKDu non-prevalence areas where the people were not affected by the disease (Zone III). They have selected areas where disease free as the control.
WHO recommendations
In high-CKDu prevalence areas, the main drinking water sources were dug or tube well water, while in low-CKDu-prevalence areas, it was mostly dug well water and from water treatment plants. However, in CKDu non-prevalence, (where those isolated pockets are nearby to high-CKDu prevalence areas), the residents used spring water.
As it is highly suspected that the high concentrations of cadmium (Cd), aluminum (Al) and arsenic (As) in drinking water caused for high incidence of CKDu, the trace elements present in the water were also analyzed. Interestingly research carried out by the NIFS scientists found that the Cd levels in drinking water was below the WHO standard (3.0 g/L ) in both high-CKDu and low-CKDu-prevalence areas while and in control areas, the Cd levels in drinking water was found to be low (0.570.64 g/L).
The lowest Cd concentrations were found from spring waters (in CKDu non-prevalence areas). Therefore, it was unlikely that Cd alone to be considered as a potential risk factor for high CKDu prevalence. It was noticed high fluoride and hardness in drinking water sources in zone I where CKDu prevalence is high and fluoride levels were higher in CKDu prevalence areas than in CKDu non-prevalence areas. Remarkably, in areas where the people are not affected by the disease, the average fluoride level is 0.07 (mg/L) which is much lower than the WHO recommendations.
According to previous research, the zones with high and low CKDu prevalence areas overlap with the high groundwater fluoride terrains of Sri Lanka. These data clearly indicated that people living in high-CKDu prevalence areas had consumed more fluoride than WHO recommended value, and therefore, the presence of the fluoride in drinking water for the prevalence patterns of CKDu incidence is remarkable. However, water quality analysis done by the NIFS researchers, indicates that single element is not responsible for prevalence of CKDu.
As, it was impossible to establish a single causative factor (from among F, Al, Cd, hardness) for the etiology of CKDu, the team proposed a multi-faceted nature of possible causative factor and explicitly existence of a synergistic effect of hardness, F and Cd with the incidence of CKDu based on the statistical analysis. This concept was appeared in a peer reviewed scientific journal titled Environmental Geochemistry and Health (contact NIFS for further details).
The NIFS Research team, with the assistance of researchers at Veterinary Faculty of University of Peradeniya and Veterinary Research Institute at Gannoruwa, conducted animal trials to attest their proposed hypothesis of synergistic effect of hardness, F and Cd on CKDu. The first animal trial conducted by the research team to assay the effect of Al, F and AlFx complex on CKDu revealed that the treated drinking water containing F and Al with same level of WHO recommendations or moderately above the WHO levels or AlFx in low level (0.0715 mg/L) did not lead to CKD in mice.
The second animal trail was conducted to see the synergic effect(s) of heavy metals, aluminium, arsenic, fluoride and hardness in drinking water on kidney tissues of mice.
The histopathological results clearly demonstrated that the mice fed with drinking water containing WHO recommended levels of Cd, F along with hardness, leading to early lesions similar to those of CKD. Severity of the toxicity on kidney was found to depend on the contamination levels as well as their combined effects.
The team finally concludes that a synergic effect(s) especially among Cd, F and hardness of water could lead to severe kidney damage even at WHO recommended or slightly higher (double dose) levels in chronic administrations. By considering its importance, this finding was published in Scientific Reports of Nature publishers journal in 2017.

OPPO grows 133% YoY, year-on-year
OPPO had a strong finish to a momentous 2016 that saw 133 percent year-on-year growth for the global smartphone brand, according to the latest results from independent research firm IDC. A core product range that paired premium design with excellent photography helped OPPO maintain its position as the no. 4 smartphone brand globally by market share, and earn the no. 1 spot in China for the two most recent quarters.
IDCs preliminarydata showed that OPPO accounted for 6.8 percent of the global smartphone market in 2016, and had four straight quarters of greater than 100 percent year-on-year growth.
In 2016, our strategy was to stay simple and focused  putting out premium-quality products with phenomenal cameras, said Sky Li, OPPO VP and Managing Director of International Mobile Business. The success we saw is because of our commitment to listening to our users and bringing them devices tailor-made for their lifestyles. Well redouble that commitment as we continue our global expansion this year.
OPPO focused on two main product lines last year  its Selfie Expert F series, and the stylish R series, whose industry-leading front and rear cameras embodied the OPPO Camera phone brand concept.
The F1s, sporting a 16 MP front camera, was a resounding success in South and Southeast Asia, two key regions for OPPO. It connected with a growing market of selfie-fanatic millenials, helping OPPO to hit a 10.9 percent sales unit share in Indias offline market in December, up from 1.2 percent at the same time in 2015, according to data from research firm Gfk.
2016 also saw continued expansion for OPPO around the globe, as it extended its business to 26 countries, including new markets in New Zealand, Kazakhstan and Saudi Arabia. In 2017, the company will leverage a recently established marketing center in Egypt to support accelerated expansion in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Prelates want Big Matches banned
Annual School Big Matches should be banned for the well-being of youngsters, several Chief Buddhist Prelates declared yesterday. Southern Province Chief Sangha Nayake of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Chapter Ven. Omalpe Sobhitha Thera said big matches were acting as a platform to promote alcohol and violence among schoolchildren and the government should at least consider a temporary ban until a solution is found to overcome the issues.
Speaking at a media briefing at the Government Information Department, Ven. Sobhitha Thera said the Defence Ministry should move in to halt the annual big match between Ananda College and Nalanda College if the principals take no action to stop the match, given the recent violent clashes between the students of the two schools.
He said: Big matches have to be held within a legal framework. Consumption of liquor and other drugs have to be banned within the premises where big matches are held. Members of Old Boys Associations have to be mindful to cater to the betterment of the future generations. Otherwise, they will be considered as Old Beasts who contribute to the destruction of the young generation. Principals also have to take responsibility to educate students to behave according to their school anthems.
Ven. Sobhitha Thera added that the Police should take legal action against offenders. The Yahapalanaya Government has to establish harmony and good governance, and eliminate tense situations, he added.
Siyam Chapter Chief Prelate Most Ven. Ittapana Dhammalankara Mahanayaka Thera said: Big matches provide a platform for the promotion of liquor and other drugs. Therefore, big matches contribute to the exposure of students to these harmful habits. This is destructive to the whole nation.
Ven. Vajirarama Gnanaseeha Thera said principals should implement a rigorous code of ethics to create a strong ethical framework within schools.
Ven. Kuppiyawatte Bodhananda Thera said a sport is meant to create a better individual and not to lead society towards destruction.
Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media State Minister Karunarathna Paranawithana said Mathin Thora Ratak programme would be conducted island wide to create a country free of alcohol and drugs under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.

Ragging torture chamber uncovered

Eight freshers attached to the Peradeniya Universitys Agriculture Faculty who had been subjected to torture in the name of ragging by a group of second-year students of the same faculty by taking them to a rented house in Megoda Kalugamuwa Peradeniya, stripping them naked and assaulting them with clubs were rescued by the Peradeniya police.
The police raided the house around 11.20 pm on February 19. They arrested 15 second-year students in this connection. They are alleged to have maintained this house as a torture chamber. The eight freshers subjected to this degrading ragging have been admitted to the Peradeniya hospital for treatment.
Police said investigations revealed that these second-year students had rented this house on January 2 at Rs. 10,000 per month for a period of three months by paying the money in full posing as architects attached to a form of architects.
The half-complete house belonged to a minor employee attached to the Galaha MoH office. Police believe that this house may have been used for ragging new entrants on earlier occasions too. Investigations revealed that the eight students had been taken to the house in a van from Kandy around noon that day. The raid was conducted by a police team led by Peradeniya Police OIC Chief Inspector Kamal Ariyawansa.
Agriculture Faculty Dean Prof. Gamini Pushpakumara, University Proctor Dr. Gamini Hitinayake, Deputy Proctor Dr Suranga Kodituwakku and Acting Chief Marshal Deepal Ratnayake accompanied the Police team.

Rolls-Royce reports record loss of 4.6bn
A bribery settlement and the fall in the pound have pushed engineering giant Rolls-Royce to a record loss.
The jet engine maker reported a loss before tax of 4.6bn for 2016.
However, once one-off costs have been stripped out, the company's underlying profit was better than many experts had predicted.
Rolls-Royce agreed to pay 671m to settle corruption cases with UK and US authorities and it has written off 4.4bn from currency related contracts.
Protection
Like many international businesses, Rolls-Royce usually "hedges" its bets to protect itself from fluctuating currency markets.
Most international aerospace contracts are priced in dollars, but, as a UK company, much of Rolls-Royce's costs are in pounds.
It takes out long-term currency trades. These were designed to protect the firm against what seemed the most likely risk- the fall in the dollar - and many of them were put in place before the EU referendum was even announced. (BBC)

The root cause of ethnic war
Sri Lankas Ethnic War is caused by the existence of the Dry Zone. Although the above statement sounds ridiculous, it is quite true. Darwins law states that all living things have to adapt to their environment in order to survive - the survival of the fittest theory.
The Dry Zone of Sri Lanka did not sustain the Tamils who lived there. When the British made the island into a Unitary State, they did not have the technology in the 16th century to develop it. The Tamils were therefore faced with starvation unless they went down South for employment to feed their families in the North and East. They were therefore forced to study English in order to survive.
It was either education or starvation. When my Great Grandfather, who was teaching at Central College, Jaffna left, the boys followed him and begged to be taught under the street lamps. Such was the demand for education among the Tamils to survive the Dry Zone environment.
Foreign masters
The Sinhalese living in the lush South did not have such a problem. They even resisted the learning of English because it belonged to the foreign masters. Matters changed with the arrival of a British Army Officer - Col. Henry Steele Olcott, who was an ardent Buddhist. He was able to convince the Buddhist Sangha to open up schools for Buddhist children for the teaching of English, which was even then becoming an international language. The Sinhalese did not have the strong motivation of the Tamils, so through the years the Tamils became a better educated community, taking all the jobs from the Sinhala majority - from the banana seller to the Chief Justice! This imbalance had to be urgently redressed to avoid destabilisation and unrest.
S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who was ambitious to be Prime Minister at any cost, promised the Sinhala people that if he was voted as Prime Minister he would ban Tamil and English and introduce Sinhala Only in twenty four hours. So the Sinhalese gleefully voted him in. This naturally upset the Tamils and other minorities. The Tamils were denied even federation and were eventually forced to take up arms and demand separation and the 28 year old ethnic war was the result.
Reconciliation process
Had there been no Dry Zone in the island the British would have planted tea, rubber and coconut like in the South and there would have been parity between the two communities and peace in the island. Also Bandaranaike would not have been assassinated by a Buddhist monk, because he tried to appease the Tamils.
I recently met a retired Professor of Demography in London and mentioned to him about the Dry Zone. He said this Environmental Factor never occurred to him and complemented me on my lateral thinking! He also said, appreciating the importance of factor this by the Sinhala majority, will go a long way in the reconciliation process.

Scarily bad
February, normally a lull in the film industry, includes many movies aiming to be the first success of 2017. Rings, the third film based on a book by Japanese author, Ko^ji Suzuki, titled Ringu, does not promise to be that film. Like many horror franchise reboots, it fails to live up to the original film.
Right from the beginning of the film, there are various disconnected character introductions. Rings starts with a plane crash that may have come out of the Final Destination series. The characters who die in this opening sequence are never given a story, leaving audience members to consider where this film falls related to the past two in the series. Julia, the main character (Matilda Lutz) and two other leads  Holt (Alex Roe) and Gabriel (The Big Bang Theorys Johnny Galecki)  also have no backstory, and never get past being one-dimensional offerings to some of their inevitable dooms.
After the opening sequence and character introductions, the original VHS tape that was featured in the first two films ends up with a college professor, Gabriel. After he views the tape and receives the eerie phone call that foretells his impending demise in seven days, there are interesting cinematics, like a fly appearing out of cigarette ash and the rain outside falling up towards the sky, instead of the ground. These unique cinematics fit the tone at the moment, but are not continued throughout. It seems like the screenplay was directed by another filmmaker, as the cinematic quality significantly decreased over the course of the entire film. Inquisitor

Bogged down by demonetisation and higher fuel costs, SpiceJet on Tuesday reported a 24 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 181.1 crore in three months ended December 2016 even as the second largest low-cost carrier remained in the black for the eighth straight quarter. The airline had posted a net profit of Rs 238.39 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
The company said it could remain profitable despite a softening of demand due to demonetisation and rising fuel prices.
The airline reported operating revenue of Rs 1,642.4 crore as its seat load factor remained robust at 90.7 per cent, the highest in the industry.
Over all, the company is doing well on all operating parameters be it the load factor, on time performance or flight cancellation rate. For 21 months now, the load factor has been above 90 per cent.
Despite the controversy, the OTP has been highest in last six months and the cancellation rate is also the lowest.
So airline has shaped up well, SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh said.
SpiceJet has reported its eighth successive profitable quarter despite headwinds, he said adding, Our historic aircraft order signifies the end of the turnaround phase and marks the beginning of a growth story.
Profits for the quarter were impacted by demonetisation and higher fuel prices. Things are improving, I think the effect of demonetisation is reducing. But still there was impact of demonetisation on the international travel, especially. I think it will take another 2-3 months to come out of it, Singh added.
The aircraft order would help build an even stronger and more profitable airline, he said, adding, We will be relentless in reducing our costs and identifying new avenues for revenue generation.
In the largest commercial aircraft deal for Boeing in the country, the Gurgaon-based SpiceJet had early this year announced it would purchase up to 205 aircraft from Boeing worth Rs 1.50 lakh crore.
During the December quarter, SpiceJet carried 3.48 million passengers as against 2.85 million flown by the carrier a year ago.
However, the fuel cost went up by 29 per cent to Rs 4,737 crore in Q3 FY17 as compared with Rs 3,666 crore in the December quarter of the previous fiscal.

Sri Lanka fields first Asian Winter Games snowboarder

Swimmer-turned-snowboarder Azquiya Usuph is an unlikely pioneer for winter sports in sun-kissed Sri Lanka, but following in the traditions of plucky triers such as Jamaica's bobsledders and British ski jumper Eddie 'the Eagle' Edwards, a Sri Lankan snowboarder has overcome her nerves and a glaring lack of experience to blaze a trail at the Asian Winter Games.
Despite "freaking out" -- and then falling -- at the start line, 16-year-old Azquiya Usuph took off and hurtled down a mountain at breakneck speed in the women's snowboarding in Sapporo on Sunday, crashing several times.
While most of her rivals fearlessly charged down the icy course in a desperate attempt to win a medal in the giant slalom, Usuph's modest ambition was to make it to the bottom in one piece.
And though she achieved that goal, the schoolgirl -- who saw snow for the first time in 2015, and admits she is more of a swimmer than a snowboarder -- was disqualified after missing a gate.
"When I got to the starting gate, I was so scared and I fell over straight away," Usuph told AFP, after becoming the first Sri Lankan woman to compete at the Asian Winter Games.
"I fell over like four times and although I missed one of the gates I still made it to the finish," added the unlikely pioneer.
"My main goal was to complete the race. I'm actually very happy because I'm new to snowboarding."
Sri Lanka is better known for producing cricketers than skiers, but the sun-kissed South Asian island is developing a winter sports programme.
Usuph's brave foray came as part of a drive to promote winter sports across the entire Asian region, which will host Winter Olympics at Pyeongchang and Beijing in 2018 and 2022.
Sri Lankan Olympic officials insist Usuph won't be the last woman from her country to take on similarly hair-raising challenges.
- 'Not everyone can be winners' -
"This is just the beginning," said National Olympic Committee secretary general Maxwell de Silva.
"You will see in time that we will be a force to be reckoned with because we have people with very good sporting backgrounds," he added.
"Not everyone can be winners but we're sending a message that Sri Lankans are capable of doing anything if given the right training and opportunities."
At the 1988 Calgary Winter Olympics, tropical Jamaica made headlines by entering the bobsleigh competition, inspiring the 1993 comedy "Cool Runnings".
Britain's Edwards shot to fame at the same Games with his celebrated attempt at ski jumping, a story which was immortalised in last year's "Eddie the Eagle".
Usuph, a similarly improbable contender, was selected because she is a talented swimmer, having won a national age-group title in backstroke.
The first time she saw snow was in 2015, when she was packed off to South Korea to learn how to snowboard.
"I actually learnt to snowboard really fast, in a span of 14 days, which was kind of surprising," said Usuph, who has no plans to take up the sport seriously.
Usuph also spent time at a training camp in Slovenia and regularly surfs to improve her balance and turns.
She confessed, however, that when she climbed the mountain in Sapporo and stared down the steep slope, the nerves kicked in.
"I was freaking out a bit," said Usuph. "I even thought about calling my dad to say that I couldn't do it. But this was a chance in a lifetime so I just had to go for it."
Her real ambitions lie in the pool, however.
"Swimming's really my sport," smiled Usuph. "I would love to go to the Tokyo Olympics as a swimmer and this has shown me that I can do anything if I train hard enough."

Sri Lanka sets up WTO backed export compliance mechanism

Sri Lanka is moving to set up the first national level mechanism to overcome export quarantining and other technical barriers.
The Commerce Department is ready to set up a National Committee on SPS and TBT to overcome our export compliance issues specially Sanitary and Phytosanitary and Technical Barriers to Trade, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said after inaugurating the Colombo info session with WTO experts for Lankan officials in the field.
This SPS info series launched by my Ministry with two WTO experts in September 2014 has today grown to include a bigger number of experts and SPS subject officials in Sri Lanka. As I stressed in 2014 more and more countries around the world continue to reduce their border tariffs especially through an increasing number Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs).
Since 1995 over 400 additional arrangements have been notified to WTO. In this background SPS and TBT measures have begun to create a significant impact on international trade impacting Sri Lanka negatively as it is a Small and Vulnerable Economy.
Currently FTAs are being negotiated with China and Singapore and present FTA with India too could expand for which talks are going on. Accordingly it is necessary for SPS and TBT measures to ensure the quality of Sri Lankan exports without restricting our trade and avoiding
unnecessary disruptions.
WTO Trade and Environment Counsellor Erik Wijkstrom said SPS and TBT compliance has become a great need in exports of developing countries such as Sri Lanka. Across the world, average trade tariff is at 9%. Tariff reduction is not so much important anymore as those days. What is now important for trade is overcoming non-tariff barriers such as quality compliance, SPS and TBT. Compliance in these is especially beneficial for agricultural exports of countries such as Sri Lanka.

Strangers donate 2,500 to save a dying rescue terrier dog
Caring strangers have given a dying rescue dog her life back after donating 2,500 in just hours for her to be fitted with a pacemaker.
Molly, a five-year-old terrier cross, was diagnosed with a third-degree cardiac block that caused her heart to beat too slowly  a condition that was gradually killing her.
News of her plight clearly touched peoples hearts because when the RSPCA appealed this month for donations for a life-saving operation, the cash was raised in only three hours.
Molly was fitted with the device in a two-hour operation by Chris Linney, head of cardiology at Willows Veterinary Centre in Solihull, and is recovering at the RSPCA kennels in Coventry.
Mr Linney said: Mollys story has really captured peoples imagination. Its a fairly uncommon procedure to fit a dog with a pacemaker.
The operation was challenging due to her small size, but Molly is recovering really well.
The whole team has fallen in love with her. She is a fantastic dog.
Molly, who has featured on Channel 5s The Dog Rescuers, was taken in by the RSPCA in May last year after her former owner failed to care for her properly. She has already spent several months overcoming a severe skin condition.
Danni Holder, from the RSPCA, said: The operation means Molly now has a new lease of life. We think she will get rehomed really quickly, which will be the icing on the cake for her. Daily Mail

Talk to babies and let them babble back
Even young infants can have conversations with mom or dad. Their turn just tends to involve a smile or babble instead of words. That's a key lesson from programs that are coaching parents to talk more with their babies - and recording their attempts.
Low-income children hear far fewer words by age 3 than more affluent kids, a developmental disadvantage. Trying to bridge that gap, one program in Providence, Rhode Island, straps "word pedometers" onto tots to record how many words a day they hear. Another in New York City records video of parents practicing conversation strategies with babies too young to even say "Da-da."
Researchers say early findings are promising. They were presented Friday at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston. AP

The humble balayage - hand-painted subtle highlights - has got a new twist, and a new name. Say hello to tiger eye hair, the colour you need to get this season to add warmth and dimension to your hair.
Before we go ahead with it, lets refresh our knowledge. Tiger eye is a semi-precious stone with a distinct pattern of rich bronze, gold and dark brown stripes.
Tiger eye hair means the same shade family on your strands, but instead of the clearly demarcated lines, the hues are applied with balayage technique, which results in a beautiful blend. Bengaluru-based makeup and hair stylist Kiinjal Mehta says, This technique a blend of dark and light tones, but in shades of brown and blondes. The best thing about these multi-tone is that it gives a voluminous look.

Trump names Lt. Gen H.R. McMaster as national security adviser

US President Donald Trump has named Lt. Gen H.R. McMaster as his national security adviser.
He will replace Lt. Gen Michael Flynn who was fired after just three weeks and three days in the job.
A lieutenant general with the US Army, H.R. McMaster served in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he worked on a government anti-corruption drive.
Trump's first choice, retired Vice Admiral Robert Harward,turned downthe role, citing "personal reasons".
Trump has praised Herbert Raymond McMaster as "a man of tremendous talent and tremendous experience" who is "highly respected by everybody in the military".
Gen. McMaster served in Afghanistan and Iraq, and is known as a thoughtful, if straight-talking, military strategist, the BBC's Aleem Maqbool reports from Washington.
He does not appear to have close ties to Moscow, and was recently commissioned to study the ways the US could counter some of Russia's military advances, our correspondent adds.
Gen. McMaster is no stranger to questioning authority. In a 2014 interview, he said: "The commanders that I've worked for, they want frank assessments, they want criticism and feedback."
Time magazine named him as one of its 100 most influential people in the world in 2014, saying he"might be the 21st Century Army's pre-eminent warrior-thinker".
He criticised the US military's involvement in the Vietnam War in his book Dereliction of Duty.
He has a PhD in US history from the University of North Carolina.
Gen McMaster has said it is "a privilege... to be able to continue serving our nation" and that he looks forward to joining the national security team.
What will his role as national security adviser involve
The role involves serving as an independent adviser to the president on issues of national security and foreign policy.
It is one of the most senior roles in the US government. Observers say the role's influence varies from administration to administration, but the adviser is seen as one of the president's key confidantes.
The adviser attends the National Security Council, and may act as a broker between different government departments.
The role is not subject to US Senate confirmation.
Why did his predecessor step down
Gen Flynn stepped downafter misleading Vice-President Mike Pence over his conversations with Russia's ambassador to the US.
Flynn is alleged to have discussed US sanctions with Russia's ambassador in calls before his own appointment.
It is illegal for private citizens to conduct US diplomacy.
However, Trump wrote on Twitter that the intelligence leaks about Flynn's conversations were "the real scandal".
Flynn's short tenure led critics to describe Trump's administration as chaotic.
Who else was considered for the job
Keith Kellogg, who took over as acting national security adviser after the resignation, will now serve as the National Security Council chief of staff.
The other candidates in the running were Robert Caslen, an Army lieutenant general who is the superintendent of the US Military Academy at West Point, and career diplomat John Bolton, who served as George W Bush's ambassador to the UN from August 2005 to December 2006.
Trump says Bolton will also serve his government "in another capacity".
Trump held interviews with the four men at Mar-a-Lago where he spent the third weekend in a row.
He has called Mar-a-Lago, a private property, the "Southern White House".

To Valentine with affection
They beat the roads again  for a different purpose, this time. It was a long march into the well-lighted spacious chamber of Nelum Pokuna Theatre on February 19. They had no placards on their hands. They had no slogans to shout. Attired fully in white, this massive crowd of youngsters were on a disciplined walk to celebrate the Valentines Day.
Valentines Day has amassed enough wrath from all fronts for its evil influence on the youngsters. As this Day dedicated to lovers grew up in Sri Lanka, it generated ample news.
There has been positive responses from the religious clergy. Venerable Galagodaatte Gnanasara Thera, for instance, initiated a Sil campaign called Ama Vessa at Viharamaha Devi Park years back as a spiritual response to the Valentines Day. It ceased to exist over the years.
The Nelum Pokuna silently witnessed a packed audience in all its floors with young devotees standing as well. The evening began with Buddhist rituals, followed by Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Theras Dhamma talk and Question and Answer session. The priest made direct reference to concepts such as sex before marriage and internet pornography usually considered taboo in daily conversations.
The major focus of his Dhamma talk was on how Internet  facebook in particular  takes a toll on daily life. Our ancestors did not have internet, he said, and they lived a comfortable life. They had less worries. They had lesser problems. They had less healthy complications. And finally, there were only a few cases of divorce, or not at all.
The priest however did not directly place the blame on facebook. The social media should be dealt very carefully. Internet and social media offer you the luxury of noble friendship, but it is a territory dominated by bad influence.
The bad influence, the priest reiterated, generates bad effects on daily life. The humans require sensual pleasures. But if you go behind them the wrong way, that will only lead you to suffering a miserable life. Pleasing your senses the wrong way is like borrowed money, which leaves you with no satisfaction at all ultimately.
The people are more interested in auspicious times and glamour for weddings. They pay a scant attention to the virtues. The marriages are plagued with countless problems because of obvious reasons,
The obvious reasons include wrongful pleasure in senses. Times, whether auspicious or inauspicious, can hardly affect ones life if they adhere to virtues properly. Most crises are originated because of bad company.
Venerable Gnanananda Thera cited an account of a porn addict who threw his smarthpone on a bowl of hot water.
He wanted to get rid of that habit somehow. So he decided to get rid of the smartphone. But then how can the smartphone be responsible for his addiction Even if he threw it away, over time he will need pornography again. He will be starving, and it will be a worse scenario the next time,
The Thera offered two tips to get rid of the addiction: avoiding the habit as much as possible and substitute it with another hobby. Being without a smartphone could be good if it could only be put into practice. Whether you use a smartphone or not, what matters more is your effort.
This is not going to be easy. You need to have the best of your efforts. The best effort followed by a wholesome habit will relieve you of the addiction, the Thera said.
Everyone, Ven Gnananda Thera reiterates, has a guardian angel (Ishta Devatha). The guardian angel could be the relations from previous births. If they are in good states of birth, they will take delight in all the good things you do. When a newly married couple enters a poruwa, they should have had led a pious life. If they had not led a pious life before, no amount of auspicious times will save them from impending disasters. Probably the Ishta Devatha will leave you cursed. In such occasions, only the well practised virtues can help you out.
This life is to be enjoyed, not for suffering, emphasised the Thera. He went on to narrate several accounts of youngsters who suffer without being able to settle the heavy loans taken for glamorous weddings. Have your wedding beautiful and charm, the Thera offered a tip, and then you do not need big cash for a lavish ceremony. That will help you look at life with a sense of reality without being sentimental.
Even if you have done many wrongs before, do not ever waste time thinking about them over and over again. That is the worst thing you can ever do. What happened in the past is gone. You cannot undo it. Try to do good as much as possible and aim your next birth in a heaven. If you will be reborn in a heavenly abode, then you will have a slight chance to enter at least the first sainthood before arahanthood. Then the effect of your wrongs will lessen, the Thera said.
Opt for celibacy before marriage, rather than otherwise, the Thera advised. Such a lifestyle has more benefits than one can imagine. Comfortable and satisfied lifestyle aside, the young couple will also be entitled to bear smart and intelligent kids.
The pin-drop silence that ensued throughout the four-hour long session indicated one thing: the audience was attentive to Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thera who ranged the riches of the Buddhas teachings in order. This could probably come as a bolt from the blue in this day and age of much noise on the streets.
It was no walk against Saint Valentine. It was rather an evening that capitalised on Valentines Day to enlighten the younger generation about a happy and comfortable lifestyle. If he was alive today, Saint Valentine would have been overjoyed to see the February 19 crowd.

## Title: Why Sri Lanka lags behind other Asian countries

Why Sri Lanka lags behind other Asian countries
We are far behind other Asian countries said the Most Venerable Devaludena Gnanassira Mahanayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya in his Independence Day message. This is the 69th Anniversary celebration. In retrospect, it is clear that we are far behind the other Asian countries who received Independence after our country, no matter who ruled the country within this period is an extract of his statement.
Singapore, closer to home, is a classic example. It is common knowledge that Singapore lagged far behind Sri Lanka in the early 1950s (then Ceylon) so much so that the late Singaporean leader, Lee Kwan Yew was longing to catch up with Ceylon and in fact that was one of hi s election pledges then. Subsequently, Lee, having relinquished his long stint as Prime Minister, yet remained in the Cabinet as Minister, Mentor for a few years. And, later, in his memoirs titled From 3rd to 1st world, released during his lifetime, he had occasion to remark that Sri Lanka got bogged down, having got into turbulent waters (to quote him) with conflicts which kept arising with the introduction of Sinhala as the sole official language.
On the other hand, in the case of Japan , as is well known, it was devastated by the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 in quick succession. But, the Japanese, undeterred by that monumental disaster, rose from the ashes like the Pheonix and by sheer determination and dint of hard work, rose eventually to become the second world economic power after the US. Of course, Japan has since been far outstripped by China, but that is another matter, given the vast strides made by China during the last few decades, to replace Japan.
Beginning of division
Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister, Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, in his article titled Independence in Retrospect (Daily News, 04.02.2017) adverts to the arrival of Prince Wijaya in the island with 700 of his friends; and the narrative extends right up to the 69th Anniversary of Independence. He then makes a passing reference to the non-- implementation of the Bandaraike-Chelvanayakam pact and the Dudley - Chelvanayakam pact due to various influences and interferences. He then proceeds to state as follows:-
During the last seven decades after Independence, our efforts to establish a peaceful state underpinned by sustainable development have been made inefficient and ineffective by the 30- year war and also by the insurrection we had to encounter in 1971 and 1987/88.
In the first place, the historical background or root cause of the war, the genesis of the LTTE etc. are seldom dispassionately or objectively analysed my many a political analyst or commentator from the South, and then the abject failure of successive governments to address the legitimate concerns of the Tamils constituting an integral part of the countrys sovereign people, for equality and dignity with the right to substantive power-sharing. One has to remember that there was no demand for a separate State for well over two decades even after the Tamils felt isolated and sidelined by the Sinhala Only Act, Bandaranaike having jettisoned his own founding manifesto of the SLFP , providing for Sinhala and Tamil as official languages.
It is on record that Sir John Kotelawala, the then Prime Minister, on his visit to Jaffna before the 1956 General Elections, held out a promise to make Sinhala and Tamil the countrys official languages. Thereupon, stiff opposition surfaced in the South, and the UNP changed course to Sinhala only. Then, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike made a long jump to enthrone, Sinhala only within 24 hours, as the battle cry to face the 1956 elections.
Of course, Bandaranaike carried the day, and soon introduced the Sinhala Only Bill in Parliament. During the debate on the bill, he dismissed not only the arguments advanced by Tamil Parliamentarians that the bill would constitute an infringement of section 29 of the then Soulbury Constitution, but also the strong opposition to the bill expressed by the then Left leaders that it would ignite a future demand by the Tamils for a separate state, as encapsulated in the oft-repeated slogan Two languages - one nation; one language  two nations or two bleeding halves as stridently articulated by Colvin. R. De Silva.
Breakdown of pacts
The BC pact, though it fell rather short of meeting the concerns of the Tamils, was nevertheless, a half-way house which Chelvanayagam subscribed to. However, Bandaranaike dilly- dallied over its implementation for well over a year on the pretext of explaining the pact to the Sinhala people, leaving room for J.R. Jeyawardena to launch the Pada Yatra to Kandy, buttressed by the Buddhist Clergy; some 400 of them converged on his Rosmead Place residence and virtually intimidated Bandaranaike into tearing the BC pact to shreds. It was again a similar fate that befell the Dudley-Chelvanayagam pact which Dudley Senanayake abrogated in 1965 having caved in to the opposition that arose in the South.
Originally, all peaceful agitational campaigns launched by the Tamil leaders were crushed by the State, commencing with the then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike deploying the Army to Jaffna to break up the Satyagraha campaign launched opposite the Jaffna Kachcheri in 1961 and the Tamil leaders (of the Federal Party) were arrested and locked up at the Panagoda Army cantonment.
Role of Jaffna Youth Congress
Now, as we celebrate the 69th anniversary of Independence from colonial rule, it is appropriate to dwell, if briefly, on the role played by the Jaffna Youth Congress (JYC) pioneered in the late 1920s by that distinguished educationist, Handy Perinbanayagam. The JYC had in its fold a galaxy of distinguished educationalists of the caliber of Orator Subramaniam, Swamy Vipulananda , A.S. Kanagarathnam, Leftist leaders such as P. Nagalingam, ex- Senator, Jeyam Tharmakulasingham and many others. Almost all the Southern Leaders of all hues were invited by the JYC to grace their annual sessions. The JYC strove untiringly for national unity, for bilingualism and, last but not least, to eradicate caste discrimination etc in the North.
It is indeed quite remarkable that the JYC was the first organisation in the country to call for full Independence. And this was acknowledged by none other than former President. Mahinda Rajapaksha in his 63rd Independence Day speech.
And very significantly, President Maithripala Sirisena in his recent 69th Independence Day speech underlined the need for a collective effort by the people to secure economic independence. In other words, it is a clarion call that all hands shoed be put to the plough. Well, then the prerequisite for that is, first and foremost, the removal of the cancer of bribery and corruption, nepotism, and very importantly, the root cause of the 26-year-long war. And there is the perennial problem of heavy military presence even after eight years since the end of the war, and the attendant problem of non-return of lands of the war-displaced people.
