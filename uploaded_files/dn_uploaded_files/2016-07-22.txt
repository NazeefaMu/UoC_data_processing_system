Wimal may have deal with top govt. member: Dilan

SLFP Spokesman and Highways State Minister Dilan Perera yesterday noted that National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa MP may have a deal with a top-notch government member and this could probably be the reason for not taking any action against him over an issue with his passport.
He made this comment replying to a question by a journalist on why Weerawansa has not been taken to task while Front Line Socialist Party member Kumar Gunaratnam has been handed a prison sentence for violating visa rules.
The Joint Opposition (JO) is pushing the country to the extremes and communalism by leveling baseless allegations against the new constitution which is being portrayed as a death trap, Perera said.
He was addressing the weekly media briefing at the SLFP headquarters yesterday.
All 225 Parliamentarians unanimously agreed with the process of formulating a new constitution when the proposal in this regard was presented in Parliament, even though certain Joint Opposition members are now claiming that the new constitution, which is being formulated is a death trap, he said.
Even though certain Joint Opposition members claim so, how can the process of creating a new constitution be a death trap as the process was endorsed by all 225 parliamentarians. All parliamentarians agreed to convert the entire Parliament to a constitutional assembly when creating a most appropriate constitution for the country. How can they claim that the new constitution which is being created is a Constitution death trap, he asked.
Perera said the process of creating a new constitution is being carried out under a steering committee, which is overlooked by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Under the steering committee, six sub committees representing all political parties in Parliament have also been appointed. Joint Opposition members including Bandula Gunawardena, Dinesh Gunawardena, Namal Rajapaksa and a few others are members of these sub committees, he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is very flexible when preparing the new constitution, he said.
State Minister Perera said a sub-committee working on implementing a new electoral system is now deeply analysing an electoral system suggested by a Norwegian academic.
Asked if it is not an injustice to appoint a person who obtained less votes as a minister of the Southern Provincial Council, Perera said the number of votes is not considered at all times.
Seniority and the number of votes obtained are considered when appointing to a ministerial post, he said.
When Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Bandaranaike were in power certain persons were appointed to ministerial posts without any justifiable reason, he said.
Speaking on the powers of the Auditor General, he said that the Auditor General should have more powers to perform his duty more efficiently.
He added that the salary of the Auditor General should be equal to a ministry secretary.
The SLFP is preparing for the next Local Government election. Interviews are being held to select candidates for the election and this process will end in the next two months. Winning the Local Government poll is the foundation for the formation of a SLFP government, he said.
A committee has been appointed to organise the SLFP convention, which will be held on September 2. The committee will decide the venue for the convention, he said. Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said utmost priority is being given to the national security of the country regardless of what the electoral system is going to be.
There is no marginalisation in the process of appointing new SLFP organisers, he said.
Asked about the present situation with regard to the Jaffna university clash, Yapa said all sectors of the university have agreed to ensure a calm educational environment at the university.
We held discussions with all stakeholders and everyone intended to recommence the academic activity soon under a calm environment, he said.
Deputy Foreign Employment Minister Manusha Nanayakkara told the media that moves are underway to appoint more officers to the branch of the Foreign Employment Bureau established at the Bandaranaike International Airport aiming to mitigate rackets relating to foreign employment.

Jaffna  University clash must be nipped  in the bud:JVP

The clash at the Jaffna University last Saturday could be perceived as an extension of the racist mind-set developing in the people in the North, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in Parliament yesterday. He made this observation while raising a question under the Standing Order 23 (2) on the social impact of the recent incident in Jaffna University. This is not just another normal clash in a university. It occurred between two groups of students belonging to two different ethnic communities. It has severe political and social dangers. We can see the traits of racism behind it, and society must condemn it collectively, he said. The MP pointed out this incident acts as a provocation to other racist groups. We have the horendous experience of the protracted war in this country. We still dont know exactly how much were killed and disappeared during that war. It was a great setback to our country. Therefore, we should nip these kind of attempts in the bud. This incident cannot be suppressed by taking disciplinary or legal action, he said.
The MP queried about the progress of the investigations and the Governments plans to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents.
