Presidential Commission of Inquiry reinforced COPE report
The recommendations and conclusions given by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on the bond issue have been reinforced by the latest report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he pointed out that it is the responsibility of the government to proceed with legal action against offenders without further delay.
Urging the government to fully implement the recommendations of the report, the MP said the COPE findings show that the Perpetual Treasuries Limited has earned an undue profit and the leaking of inside information of the Central Bank have been reinforced by the Bond Commission.
Both the COPE and PCoI have strongly recommended punishing the offenders and recovering the loss to the government from those responsible.
Now is the time the government should show its commitment to the pledge to fight against corruption and uphold good governance, he said.

Stories Dont End Its Just a New Beginning
Writing a novel is no easy task yet for Seheni Hisara Kariyawasan, propelled by her love of reading and writing, the road has not seemed so weary. Author of The Chameleon, Seheni Hisara Kariyawasan has loved to read for as long as she can remember. Now, a 16 year old studying at Asian International School, her love for reading and writing has led to authorship of her first novel, The Chameleon. As a young girl she schooled at Bishops College where she indulged in a variety of athletic activities but none of these seemed to divert her from her passion for reading and writing.
Her creativity and imagination she traces back to her childhood when she used to play imaginary games with her grandmother. She and her grandmother would re-enact scenes from their favoured movies, role-playing and improvising when it suited them. When they ran out of movies, Seheni would create her own storylines which they would then proceed to perform. These games continued with her friends as well. We never had the electronic things that kids have nowadays, she said as she explained her contentment in playing her imaginary games with her friends.
She once tried her hand at poetry and even wrote a little book of poems entitled Joys of Childhood which she didnt get published. Through this and a few short stories she had written, she gradually began to develop her writing. On her enrolment at Asian International School, she took up Literature which moulded her writing style and encouraged her to think outside the box.
Her novel, The Chameleon belonging to the genre of mystery thriller ticks all the boxes for any mystery loving reader but what makes it unique is its complex variety of perspectives and plotlines. Every character has a part to play explained Seheni as she elaborated on her choice of shifting timelines and points of view. Youll find that at the end, each character contributed in some form to the overall primary plot of the novel. Every twist, every perspective, every change in story line is included and a contributing factor to her conclusion.
The Chameleon came to her in a dream, in the form of one of the main characters of her novel  Kalek Azaron. Inspired by the dream she and her friends began to develop this character, Kalek to whom she relates the most. Her favourite by far, she made sure to create him with a few of her quirks interwoven into his character such as her love of poetry which is reflected in the character. She herself favoured the genres of mystery, horror and thrillers when she immersed herself in her reading. Its definitely more interesting she said and therefore writing one seemed the natural inclination.
It was however not as easy as it seems. She did have to undergo a rollercoaster of a journey as she had to deal with the frustration of many different drafts that required re-writing. She commenced her tedious task of writing in 2015 and two years requires a load of patience and determination. Her largest hurdle, in her opinion, was the setting of the novel in London. Having never been to London, yet having a story set on its real streets required a lot of research and preparation. Mapping it all out was definitely the hardest explained Seheni as she described the effort that went into locating two streets that were close together so as to enable a smooth change in setting.
Having it based in Sri Lanka would just not have had the same effect.
Seheni hopes that her readers will note and understand the importance of every character as there are no binaries and the lines between good and evil often blur. She also emphasized that stories dont end its simply a new beginning which she depicts at both the start and end of her novel. Similarly, she believes her journey as an author is not at its end but is definitely paused until she overcomes her next hurdle  O/Ls. She hopes to continue writing, not with the same characters but definitely in the same genre perhaps working with a little more horror. Whichever path she takes it is quite clear that Sehenis story is just beginning.

Ambalantota town development plan yet a dream
Any hopes of development have not fallen upon Ambalantota with the coming into existence of successive regimes. Plans were drawn up by the UDA for the development of Ambalantota town several years ago but the implementation of the development plan still remains a dream according to the residents.
Ambalantota is the main economic hub in Hambantota district and is also a hub of quite a number of important activities. The vehicular traffic congestion in the heart of the Ambalantota town prevails during pola days on Mondays and Thursdays.
The Waduruppa road that runs from the heart of the town also gets congested with vehicles. It is such a narrow road that two vehicles cannot pass at the same time.
The existing bus stand is situated on a small plot of land. It is not enough for the commuters to take shelter during rainy days.
The weekly pola is congested as such the consumers cannot move about freely to make their purchases. The Ridiyagama road is used as the bus stand for private and CTB buses causing hard ships to the vehicular traffic. The trishaw park is also on the Ridiyagama road. This trishaw park is a hindrance to the pedestrians. The Clock Tower in the heart of the town is used for propaganda work by businessmen and politicians.
The drain complex in the heart of the town remains clogged with refuse garbage and refuse water. But the sanitary labourers perform their duty to keep them clean very often. Certain businessmen throw refuse to the drains instead of dumping refuse in the waste paper baskets that are made available. These drains pose a threat to the health and sanitary conditions of the citizens.

Appreciations
I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla: He was courageous
This article is specially written for the 110th birth anniversary of late I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla which fell on January 3, 2018.
It has been 45 years since I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla, author, translator, orator editor, and a Sinhala scholar, honest politician, former Education and Cultural Affairs Minister from 1965-1970, passed away.
Iriyagolla was born in the Iriyagolla village in Dandagamuwa, Kuliyapitiya, on January 3, 1907. His full name is Imiya Mudiyanselage Raphiel Abayawansa Irriyagolla.
He was an old boy of the then Ananda College at Colombo. He created a new political era of delivering truth openly to the masses and also to Buddhist monks. He was highly associated with E. W. Adikaram L. H. Meththananda, Prof. Senarath Paranawithana, Prof. G. P. Malalasekara, Dr. Ananda Guruge, and P. de S. Kularatne etc.
Iriyagolla was married to Rani Gunasekara, who was born in Matale.
After completing his formal education, he joined the Sri Lanka Police Department and became a Police inspector, but due to his talents, he give up the Police service and became the editor of a Sinhala newspaper. He later became the editor of the Sinhala Baudhdhaya newspaper under Maha Bodhi Society of Sri Lanka.
Iriyagolla's life was enlightened due to his courage and association with late Anagarika Dharmapala. During this period, Iriyagolla himself became a life member of the Mahabodhi Society, Paramawinnantha Buddhist Association, and All Ceylon Buddhist Congress.
During his younger days, he was able to publish his book named Manuthapaya. Later, he wrote a another book named Devathapaya. Iriyagolla then became a politician after the independence of Sri Lanka. Iriyagolla first contested in the Dandagamuwa Electorate in Kuliyapitiya. He became the Member of Parliament for Dandagamuwa in 1952 as an independent candidate due to his popularity among the masses.
In 1953, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the then Home Affairs Minister in the UNP government headed by the late D. S. Senanayake Cabinet, left from the United National Party and formed the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP). Iriyagolla was close to Bandaranaike during this period and contested in the Dandagamuwa Electorate under the MEP. He won with a high majority. After the election results were announced in 1956, Bandaranaike became the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and Iriyagolla was sworn in as the Deputy Minister of Industries.
He later left the MEP in 1959 and formed his own political party: Samajawadhi Mahajana Peramuna. Iriyagolla contested in the 1960 March elections under his own political party under the symbol of the eye. He was able to nominate candidates under his new political party to all the electorates in the country, but only he was able to win the 1960 March elections; all his other candidates lost the elections. As he was the only MP representing the Mahajana Samajawadhi Peramuna in Parliament in March, 1960, Iriyagolla joined hands with the UNP.
During this period, he understood the good qualities of the then UNP leader Dudley Senanayaka and worked hard for the UNP to come power. Dudley Senanayake assigned Iriyagolla to work at Srikotha, the UNP headquarters.
Senanayake requested Iriyagolla to contest under the UNP in the 1965 elections for the Kuliyapitiya Electorate. Iriyagolla won with a good majority in 1965, and Senanayaka selected Iriyagolla as the Education and Cultural Affairs Minister of his Cabinet.
As the Education and Cultural Affairs Minister, Iriyagolla rendered a yeoman service to the nation between 1965-1970. Iriyagolla set up universities in the country and provided training to youths to engage in employment, setup the Buddhist Pali University in Anuradhapura for Buddhist monks to obtained higher studies in the Dhamma and Pali. He also managed to restore the Sigiriya frescoes after it was damaged by an unknown character.
He composed songs to promote patriotism among schoolchildren and made arrangements to play those songs prior to the opening time of schools. Hundreds of Siyawasa school libraries were also opened, the shortage of teachers was quelled, and teacher assistants were recruited to provide teachers with the proper training. His name remains unforgettable even today, as he was the pioneer behind the establishment of the D. S. Senanayaka and Mahanama Colleges in Colombo.
His two sons, namely Gamini Iriyagolla (civil servant) and Dr. Deva Iriyagolla both have passed away, but his three daughters, namely Pushphamala, Sama, and Sagarika, are living happily; all of them well-educated in different fields to render services to country in order to fulfill what Iriyagolla taught. His daughter-in-law Indrani Iriyagolla is engaged in social work, performing a eminent service for the welfare of women in Sri Lanka.
I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla's name would not be forgotten, even decades into the furture. We should pay our gratitude to his great service rendered to our country to maintain high discipline in our universities and schools as a father to all students.
He was thus named because of his honesty, integrity, sincerity, and enthusiasm towards the people and the nation. I. M. R. A. Iriyagolla should be treated as the most outstanding straightforward political leader produced by the sathkoralaya of Sri Lanka since Independence.
May you attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana.
W. A. C. P. Wijayaratne
To Chrissie: until we meet again
I met you so many years ago at a picnic, and when I saw you,
My heart went pang at that time, realizing little that I had started a journey long
I walked up to you, you smiled and looked at me with mischievous eyes
And handed me a cup of tea,
This was the first of billions of cups you would hand me, my love It took some time to realize that the pang was lovemy first love
It was my greatest joy to hear you say Dennis, I loved you at first sight
But the romance was taboo, and many tried to break our bond
It was then that we realized that our strong bond would never die
When they would not compromise, we left to face the world together
When you left, Chrissie, you were crying, but never did you look back, my love
Your pain would not die, because you lost so much, my love
But I proved to be strong, and so did you; we withstood the storm together
Later, I became the best son-in-law father and everyone accepted us
Now, all united and happy as could be, love had won
My mother, Ann, met us at the door and gave her blessing
She asked, Chrissie, are you hungry, dear; while Chrissie ate, she stitched a gown
The only woman I ever loved before Chrissie was my mother
And on the 15th of May, you became my wife; we were so happy
Then five children did we have, and we were complete
With our little bundles of joy growing up until an accident
Did shatter our lives
My darling Ruvani, the youngest,
Was crushed, but we had more happy years together but she
Left us twenty years later; now, she is with Chrissie in the stars My Chrissie, did you not promise me that one day, we would die together
I had made all my plans to be with you; now I am lonely, in the dark
Then God made a miracle when my three children did step in
With all their love, the darkness abated
Now I sit in the dark some times and close my eyes
And there you are, by my side again, laughing and talking
Like we first met, as if you never left
I will be joining you soon, Chrissie, and this time My darling, we will never part
Dennis

Arjuna determined to clean-up CPC
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that most of the ministers call him the chairman of the cleaning service. He made this statement during the New Year celebration function held at the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, on Wednesday.
The minister further stated that he was able to reduce corruption and also initiate development projects within the last six months.
Earlier, Lanka OIC was a part of the oil distribution process. Some people are trying to be a third or fourth party to this. We dont prefer privatization and the responsibility to protect this institution is vested on us. Even workers who have completed 99.9 percent out of the work, must complete the balance one percent to reach success. We have commenced the construction of oil tanks after 40 years. We expect to construct another six oil tanks after six months. No one wanted to construct a refinery system. But we expect to construct it soon. Some people are trying to stop this construction while suggesting to import oil for higher prices.
I will not stick on to positions if they are not allowing me to work. I always take decisions which are favourable for the country. When the President and Prime Minister handed over this ministry they requested me to solve all issues which exists in this ministry. Most of the ministers called me the chairman of the cleaning service. I have already worked hard and made institutions profitable, Minister Ranatunga stated.
Meanwhile the Deputy Minister of Petroleum Resources Development Dr. Anoma Gamage said, We have a vast amount of workers including 3,000 in the (CPC) and 2,700 in CPSTL. Minister Ranatunga and I have the highest regard in parliament. Everyone is following both of us to get approval for petrol sheds or to seek a job. Even Im glad about the progress, but there are still shortcomings.
I think we can do more than this. We have to work as a private institution though this is a government institution. I personally prefer to privatize all governmental institutions. I have worked in both private and government institutions. The most valuable thing is efficiency.
Minister Ranatunga, the Board of the Directors and I are expecting to maintain an efficient service to avoid another fuel crisis in the future. The SMS was circulated by people within the CPC and that is why it hurts. We are blessed to be government servants. Therefore, work properly, she urged.
Chairman of the CPC Dammika Ranatunga also praised the Minister and Deputy Minister for their co-operation to work without political influence.

Obviously, as the Foreword writer says- 
Balayoginis poems will be read with great interest as the outside world is gaining access to North Sri Lanka after the recent cessation of war. The environmental ruins and the human toll will probably give people an idea of the experiences in this land.
Lanka born American professor Suresh Canagarajah in his Foreword also adds: However, Balayoginis poems give voice to her own and other peoples feelings and thoughts of that time
In an appreciative analysis, Canagarajah aptly points out the strength of the poet in her observations and feelings and most importantly her experiment with the craft of poetry writing. The poet has an M Phil in Linguistics.
Its worth quoting Prof Suresh Canagarajah again:
She provides a sensitive window into the hearts and minds of people who went through violence, poverty, bereavement, and uncertainty in their lives orphaned children, confused child soldiers, moribund scholars, apathetic students, despondent refugees, and perfunctory political bureaucrats.
Canagarajah also observes that She represents experiences of love, sex, family, and friendship that transcend politics and gain poignancy being set in the painful political environment.
What about the poets craft She is sensitive to rhythm, imagery, spacing, rhyme, and word choice as she talks about her experience, says Suresh Canagarajah.
Having assimilated what Suresh has said above let me give my comments with illustrations from Balayoginis poems.
She beautifully alludes rhythm of music to the touch of her beloved in this poem
A string from the Guitars mid
A string from the violins bed
And
A sting from this un-blossomed heart
Ring when His
Fingers touch.
Another poem I liked was this titled The Clouds
An
Hour
was given
For us to
Quit
Our Motherland.
I saw
Many bullock carts
Slowly rumbling on
On the crowded rugged
Roads.
Through the
Thick gloomy palmyrah
Groves
The clouds of
Deep sighs of the
Tattered Souls
Blinded the blank heaven
When they thought of
Stepping on to some
Strange soil.
The above poem could be referring to the unreasonable driving away of the Muslims from the Yaalpaanam peninsula by the Tigers OR
The compulsive shifting of Tamil people from place to place in fear of shelling by the Airforce.
I liked her usage of Blinded the blank heaven and also The clouds of Deep sighs of the Tattered Souls showing the poets freshness in her descriptive expression.
Another poem titled The Soil is self-explanatory of even some places in the peninsula even though the poem was written in 2002. I wish to quote the poem in full for us in the South of Lanka to understand the ravages done to the arid reddish land of the soil of the Yaalpaanam people.
Here is the relevant poem:
Burrowed and ploughed
Burrowed and ploughed
Burrowed and ploughed
For landmines,
For Magisterial inquiries,
For Commissions
And
For the NGOs
The Northern Soil now is
Loose with brittle bones
And skulls of
The unidentified innocent
Souls who have become
Mere compost
A deposit of calcium
Carbonate adding on to
The rich limestone soil
Of the war-torn land
Under which
A current of brine runs
Silently-
Until
History is remembered.
For want of space, I refrain quoting in full the rest of the poems which are history narrated of the horror of war in the North and East. But as the poet herself says at the end of one of her poems  War has no time for Tears
However, here are some snippets from some of the remaining poems that would prompt you to read Balayogini Jeyakrishnan/s book of well-written poems.
Fenceless, gateless, boundaryless, roofless, doorless my home stood bare as if in a graveyard
You die in your own Soil-yet you die unwept too; because war has no time for tears
Being dead is one thing- being walking dead is another thing

## Title: Budget Allocations for Teacher Training
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, January 5, 2018 - 01:00
Budget Allocations for Teacher Training
The 2018 budget proposals presented in parliament on November 09, 2017 has correctly recognized the importance of good quality teachers for improving education in the country. The budget has allocated Rs. 50 million to increase the allowance given to teacher trainees to Rs.5,000 a month and allocated another Rs. 50 million for the establishment of a centre for training English teachers. Highly qualified teachers in all classrooms are necessary for implementing education reforms aimed at modernizing and improving education in the country; as such proposals for improving teacher training are welcome.
But, recent IPS research, conducted using School Census data for 2016, shows that there is no shortage of teachers for English language, science, and mathematics at the national level. However, there is a shortage of qualified and experienced teachers to teach these subjects. This shortage is apparent at the national level as well as sub national levels. The shortage is worst for mathematics teachers, followed by science teachers.
Who is a qualifiedteacher
We consider a teacher who has either a degree in a particular subject, or have been specially trained to teach a particular subject, to be a qualified teacher (i.e., a teacher with the subject knowledge to teach a subject).
Who is an experiencedteacher
Usually teachers are recruited to class 3 of the teacher service. Only those with a degree in education are directly recruited to Class 2  Grade II. Those who have been recruited to Class 3, depending on their initial recruitment, need to obtain three to five years experience in teaching and pass the efficiency bar exam to be promoted into Class 2  Grade II. This suggests that all Class 2 teachers are with subject and pedagogical knowledge as well as with at least three years of experience. Hence, in our analysis we consider teachers with a grade higher than Class 2 - Grade II to be experienced teachers.
How do we measureteacher adequacy
The teacher cadres for each school in Sri Lanka are determined according to the guidelines detailed by the Ministry of Education (MOE). These guidelines take into account the number of classes in the school, the number of subjects taught in the school, and the medium (i.e., Sinhala, Tamil or English) in which these subjects are taught. In this article, the recommended number of teachers is referred to as RT. School census data provides information on the number of teachers who usually teach a subject in a school. We take this as the number of available teachers (AT) to teach a subject in a school. When the available teachers are less than the recommended number of teachers, (AT<RT) there is a teacher shortage; when the available teachers exceed the recommended number (AR>RT), there is a teacher surplus.
Do we have enoughteachers to teachmathematics, English,and science at thenational level
Our analysis shows that Sri Lanka has a surplus of teachers for mathematics, science and English subjects. In Sri Lanka, the number of teachers who mostly teach English, mathematics, and science are more than the number recommended by the MOE in the first circular of 2016 on determining staff numbers in a school. The largest surplus, with 3,055 more teachers than recommended, is seen for English teachers. However, when we consider experienced or qualified teachers, there are large teacher shortages for mathematics and science subjects (Figure 1). The shortage of qualified teachers (both novice as well as experienced) are apparent in all provincial schools in all provinces for mathematics and science teachers. The teacher shortages for English teachers are seen in Northern, Eastern, North Central, Uva, and Sabaragamuwa provinces.
Way forwardWay forward
The findings of the study show that the country has a large deficit of experienced and qualified cadre of teachers to teach mathematics, science, and English. The teacher training and teacher recruitment in the country is inadequate to meet the need for qualified teachers. As a result, a high share of novice teachers recruited to teach different subjects are not qualified to teach those subjects. Although, once recruited teachers are provided with in-service training to upgrade their skills, this process takes time to produce quality teachers. In the meantime, children are without access to a quality teacher.
The existing facilities to provide pre-service teacher training needs to be improved, expanded and made more relevant. At present, pre-service teacher education is conducted by the universities, colleges of education and different teacher training centres. Improving and expanding the pre-service training of teachers and giving priority for recruiting teachers with proper pre-service training can help to improve the availability of qualified teachers. Such training programmes should especially cater to the demand for teachers in different subject areas.
Teachers should be certified to teach different subjects while the subject knowledge of teachers should be taken into consideration when filling vacancies. At present the teacher recruitment does not consider subject knowledge. As done in other countries, all teachers should be certified in their ability teach a subject. Only under very special conditions should teachers be allowed to teach subjects that they are not certified to teach.
In this regard, the proposed budget allocations for improving teacher training are a welcome initiative. However, budget allocations should not only be made for improving training facilities of English teachers. They should also be improved for training science and mathematics teachers. This is especially necessary given the emphasis given in the budget for improving science, mathematics and technology training in the country.

Celtics rout Cavs as idle Thomas  gets ovation in Boston return
WASHINGTON: Terry Rozier scored 20 points off the Boston bench to lead six double-figure scorers Wednesday and the Celtics routed visiting Cleveland 102-88 in an NBA Eastern Conference showdown.
Jayson Tatum and reserve Marcus Smart each scored 15 points, Jaylen Brown added 14 points and Kyrie Irving and Al Horford each contributed 11 and nine rebounds as the East-leading Celtics improved to 31-10.
That shows what type of team we are, Rozier said of the Celtics scoring depth. From day one weve always had that next man up mentality and weve kept it going. LeBron James led Cleveland with 19 points and added seven rebounds and six assists but the Cavaliers (25-13) had a season-low point total.
Their defense was very good. They were very in tune to what we wanted to do execution-wise offensively, James said. They had a good defensive plan and they executed very well. Cavaliers big man Kevin Love injured his right ankle. He had only two points on 1-of-11 shooting.
Clevelands Isaiah Thomas sat out a night after making his season debut, missing more than two months with a hip injury after being traded from the Celtics in the deal that sent Irving to Boston.
I dont know who we are and who we can be until we get it back consistently, James said. We havent played well as of late so we are trying to figure that out as well. We will be fine, though. Thomas exchanged hugs and smiles with his former teammates and when he was shown on the scoreboard videoscreen, Boston fans responded with a standing ovation.
This is genuine love from both sides, Thomas said. The fans are everything here. Boston is definitely in my heart and will always be some type of home for me. The Celtics avenged a 102-99 opening-night loss at Cleveland in which Gordon Hayward suffered a broken left ankle in his Boston debut.

Investment for higher studies
GCE A/L results were released last week. Some students have performed well and proved their eligibility to enter universities. On the contrary another batch of students has scraped through the examination without being eligibile for the university entrance. All that leads us to one cruel factor: GCE A/L is a crucial competition.
The would-be university undergraduates have performed well on various grounds. They have attended the best schools, for one. They have studied under the best teachers, on the other hand. The students from financially-stable families would attend good tuition classes.
This group of students is lucky to have affluent as well as well educated parents. Intelligence comes easily for them.
But it is not the same phenomenon oftentimes. In some cases, the parents and teachers are not in a position to offer proper guidance to the students. In such a backdrop, the students have to be satisfied with average results.
Then these students try their level best to try out a private university. As a nation, we must concentrate on such students to provide them financial assistance. The government must draw their attention to such students in particular.
That is the only path, laid before us, to steer this nation towards prosperity.

Country faces acute shortage  of manpower - Survey
The number of existing labour vacancies in Sri Lanka by June 2017 was estimated at 497,302 and the highest demand is for sewing machine operators.
This is the first ever survey on the labour demand in the country in 2017 conducted by Department of Census and Statistics (DCS).
In addition to that the report says that security guards, other manufacturing labourers,shop sales assistants, advertising and marketing professionals, commercial and sales representatives, cleaners and helpers in offices, hotels and other establishments, manufacturing supervisors, general office clerks and stall and market salespersons were found to be highly demanded jobs in the country.
The labour market is influenced by the new technological developments and therefore required skills need to be changed accordingly, the DCS states.
The Western province has the highest number of labour demand and the Eastern province has the lowest.
Among the sectors, highest percentage of labour demand for industry sector was recorded from North-Western province.
The results of the survey is useful to capture the gaps in the output of the education system of the country as well as the demanded skills and to facilitate the workforce becoming eligible higher quality jobs and more relevant job opportunities.
Building construction labourers and oher manufacturing labourers have more demand than others.
Each of those occupations contributed by 21% and 24.9% to the total labour demand in the sector.
The largest share of foreign owners within the sector was recorded from the tourism sub-sector (3.3%) followed by the industry sector. (2.1%)
Tourism was recorded the highest share of duel ownership (Sri Lankan and foreign) within the sector. (3.1%).
Majority of employees for each occupation group belonged to age group of 25 to 45 years. The proportion of managers less than 25 years were very low comparatively to other groups.
The DSC also point out that management of the firms were highly concerned on recruiting female employees due to challenges of working with women due to their family constraints and commitments, dedication to work and absenteeism.

The Chairman of the Commission, Dr. Deepika Udagama who reviewed the complaints at a media briefing at the Commission noted that; 249 were complaints on torture (mainly police),
171 on harassment (with complaints of alleged intelligence officers harassing civilians in the North), 323 against threats (mainly from police) and 298 on arbitrary arrests and detention.
This is a major problem. On the one side, we see progress in the freedom of expression, association and assembly. But on the other side, one of our continuing concerns is in custodial violations. This clearly shows that we need strong Police reforms, Dr. Udagama said.
She however noted that the governments ratification of the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture (OPCAT) last month was nevertheless a positive step to overcome problems in detention. The government has also assigned the responsibility of implementing a local mechanism to monitor those in detention to the HRCSL.
The HRCSL which already has the mandate to conduct raids on police stations, etc... will now receive greater authority to look into violations while in custody.
The Commission however complained that many of their investigations were being delayed due to a lack of human resources and bureaucratic red tape which have slowed down implementation of their plans.
This is a common problem all Independent Commissions are facing and we have informed the Constitutional Council of this, Dr. Udagama added.
Another area with high complaints was in administrative injustices, with 770 complaints being made by people regarding the arbitrary manner in which administrative justice was meted out.
Petitioners had made 436 complaints against the police and 334 against other government institutions for having not noted down the complaints made. In addition, 1002 government officials have complained against their own offices with regard to issues of administrative injustice.
Interestingly, one of the main administrative complaints, revolve around school admissions, Dr. Udagama said.
We had close to 500 complaints with regard to children not being admitted to popular national schools. These complaints are mainly from the middle class and not what we consider a human rights violation, said the Chairman.
She further noted that violations in the right to education would include complaints made regarding the lack of facilities in remote schools or inadequate access to schools but these complaints were very few.
More worryingly, the HRCSL noted an increase in the number of violent disciplinary action taken by teachers against students and the rising trend of expelling students from schools, even for minor violations.
Dr. Udagama said they have requested from the Ministry of Education to have discussions with principals and teachers of national schools (to start off with), along with psychologists and psychiatrists to discuss ways in which discipline can be enforced in a more humane manner.
We dont think we can produce the kind of democratic citizens through a system based on exams. We need to revise the whole curriculum, she noted further, explaining that their Education Policy Sub-Committee report on the matter would be released this year.

Deepika Padukone, Ranveer Singh's birthday plans in Sri Lanka

The couple had brought in the New Year in Maldives with their respective families, sparking off speculations of an impending engagement. Close on the heels of the Bollywood wedding of the year, comes news of another A-list wedding in the offing.
Speculations are rife that actor-couple and frequent co-stars Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone are set to celebrate the latters 32nd birthday by getting engaged at a private island in Sri Lanka today.
Over the last three years, the couple who hit it off on the sets of Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Goliyon Ki Rasleela: Ram-Leela, have made a yearly ritual of celebrating each others birthdays together.
While Ranveers spokesperson denied news of the engagement to Mirror, weve learnt that after bringing in New Years Eve swimming and snorkelling over a six-day getaway at an extremely private beach resort in the Noonu Atoll island of Maldives with their respective parents in tow, the couple arrived in Sri Lanka on Thursday. The duo who will next be seen as Allauddin Khilji and Padmavati in Sanjay Leela Bhansalis upcoming historical romance Padmavati, took off for the Maldives vacation separately.
Pictures of Ranveer, bumping into Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani at Sri Lankas Katunayake airport on his way to the destination, had led to the buzz that he and his ladylove would be in the country for New Years Eve.
But a source from the Maldives International airport confirmed to Mirror that Ranveer and Deepika, along with their respective families, arrived in the archipelagos on December 28 and headed out to their resort in the blue lagoon, surrounded by reefs, in a private jet.
Deepika, who had brought in Christmas with a midnight mass at a church in Vienna, took connecting flights via Colombo to unite with her beau in the island country.
The families were booked at the resort until January 3.
This isnt the first time that the actors, along with their families, are holidaying overseas. Last year, the bunch had taken a trip to London together and has stayed at this resort three-four times in the past. The couple indulges in windsurfing and canoeing, along with sunbathing on the pristine beaches, spending time at the fitness and spa centre, both of which boast of a lagoon view. Ranveer and Deepika love the privacy the island offers, along with water sports like waterskiing and diving off a catamaran, among other adventures, informed a source close to the couple, adding that the exotic holiday destination is a favourite among European royalty as well.

Diplomatic peace-building
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono arrived in Sri Lanka for a two-day official visit yesterday evening. This is the first time in 15 years that a Japanese Foreign Minister is visiting Sri Lanka. The Minister will meet the President, the Prime Minister and the Foreign Affairs Minister today. The following is the full text of Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Konos written interview with the Daily News ahead of his visit.
Q: What is the major purpose of your visit
A: As Sri Lanka is located at a critical sea-lane point to connect Asia and Middle East/ Africa, it is a geopolitically and strategically important country. Moreover, in view of the stable public security and high economic growth in recent years, Sri Lanka is also a country with high potential for further development. Therefore I choose Sri Lanka as among my first destinations in 2018 in order to further enhance the bilateral relationship.
Japan regards the Indo-Pacific region, the centre of the vitality of the world, as free and open international public good which is based on the rule of law and promotes the Free and Open Indo-Pacific Strategy in order to ensure peace and prosperity of the region. Sri Lanka is quite significant in this context as it is developing as the international hub in the Indian Ocean.
Both Japan and Sri Lanka, as maritime nations, can enjoy development and prosperity from the free and open Indo-Pacific and thus bear responsibilities in realising it. Japan is determined to further promote peace and prosperity in the region together with Sri Lanka by enhancing connectivity through quality infrastructure projects such as the port development as well as by strengthening cooperation for maritime safety.
During my visit, I will discuss how to strengthen cooperation in the fields of healthcare and environment sectors and how to support the national reconciliation process, as well as regional and international situations including the North Korea issue.
I wish this visit would contribute to further enhancing mutual dignitaries visits and also further deepening bilateral relations between Japan and Sri Lanka.
Q: Your thoughts on the bilateral relations between Japan and Sri Lanka
A: The friendly relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka originated after the speech made by the then Finance Minister J R Jayewardene at the San Francisco Peace Conference in 1951 where he defended sovereign rights of Japan. The Japanese still remember that this speech supported Japans return to the international society after the WWII.
Since that time, both countries have consistently walked the path of friendship and cooperation. Until today, Japan has contributed to the development of social and economic infrastructure and of human resources in Sri Lanka through providing the following assistance; more than 1 trillion (almost Rs. 1.35 trillion) Yen Loan, approximately 200 billion yen (almost Rs. 270 billion) Grants Aid, worth around than 80 billion yen (almost Rs. 108 billion) Technical Cooperation and more than 1,000 Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers. Moreover, Japan has also actively supported the peace-building in Sri Lanka.
In recent years, the bilateral cooperation in the various fields such as trade and investment, maritime cooperation, people-to-people exchanges has been further enhanced under the Comprehensive Partnership between the two countries based on previous visits by Japanese and Sri Lankan leaders. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Sri Lanka in September 2014. It was the first time in 20 years for a Japanese Prime Minister to visit Sri Lanka. Then Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited Japan in May, 2016, and April, 2017, respectively.
The current bilateral relationship between Japan and Sri Lanka is supported by the long history of cooperation and through numerous mutual visits of the people, which is based on the common background as an island nation with Buddhist culture. I am determined to make efforts to further consolidate this bilateral relationship which has been inherited from the pioneers of both countries.
Q: Are Japanese firms keen on Sri Lankas investment potential
A: Economic relations between Japan and Sri Lanka have become closer since the end of the conflict over 30 years in Sri Lanka. And now Japan and Sri Lanka are important economic and trading partners with annual bilateral trade exceeding 100 billion Japanese Yen (approximately Rs.170 billion) and more than 130 Japanese companies have a presence in Sri Lanka.
Infrastructure development projects such as the port development in Sri Lanka are vital from the perspective of enhancing connectivity in the Indo-Pacific region.
Japan promotes quality infrastructure projects based on the international standards such as openness, transparency, economic efficiency and financial soundness of the recipient country.
Moreover, Sri Lanka is a fascinating country that attracts people from all over the world with attractive tourism destinations such as the rich nature and 8 World Heritage sites. I understand that the number of tourists who visit Sri Lanka has been on the rise especially after the end of the conflict in 2009. In recent years, the number of Japanese tourists has also increased to more than 40,000 per year, and I think the tourism sector in Sri Lanka is a promising field for investments.
A large-scale (nearly 100 members) business delegation from the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry will visit Sri Lanka in this month. Through various exchanges including this business delegation, I expect further increase in the Japanese investment in Sri Lanka.
Q: What are your observations on the North Korea crisis
A: Over the last two years, North Korea has not only conducted the nuclear test three times, the one in last September was far larger than its previous tests but also launched 40 ballistic missiles such as two of those flying over Japan and one of those with the range of an ICBM.
The nuclear and missile development by North Korea now poses unprecedentedly grave and imminent threats to the international community, not only to Japan or Sri Lanka.
Japan has been supporting peace and prosperity of the Asia Pacific region as a pacifist nation over 70 years since the end of the WWII. Japan is among nations who wish to solve the issue peacefully.
However, considering the fact that North Korea breached the 1994 Framework Agreement as well as the 2005 Six-Party Talk Joint Statement and continued its nuclear and missile development programmes, any dialogue with North Korea for the sake of dialogue is proven meaningless.
Therefore, in order to make North Korea change its policy, it is necessary to maximize pressure on North Korea by all means available, thereby creating a circumstance which forces North Korea to seek a dialogue.
For this purpose, Japan is determined to make its utmost efforts to increase international pressure on North Korea to the highest level through any conceivable means, including the full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, in cooperation with the U.S. and South Korea as well as through close collaboration with relevant nations including Sri Lanka.

Distribution of tablets among AL students: Cabinet paper to be presented next week
The Cabinet paper to procure 200,000 tablets to be distributed among students entering Advanced Level classes would be presented next week, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
Observing that the government has allocated Rs. 5 billion to procure the tablets, the minister said all the A/L students and teachers would receive a tablet each within the next couple of months. He said his signature was placed on the said Cabinet paper, yesterday.
The minister made these observations addressing a programme for school principals and officials at Temple Trees, yesterday, to make them aware on the governments move to distribute mobile science laboratory kits to 3,000 rural schools.
He also said they have decided to make the IT subject compulsory for schoolchildren. He added that 150,000 laptops purchased on lease, would be distributed among schools that have classes above grade 6.
Commenting further on intended educational reforms, the minister said the number of subjects for the G. C. E. Ordinary Level Examination would be reduced from 9 to 6. However, the Minister rebuffed the claims that the History subject is going to be removed. There is no such move. We have included History into the school curriculum, he said.
The minister added that the English language, which was taught as a subject only from Grade 3 above, would be taught from Grade 1 this year. He said 26 vocational streams have been introduced for the students to follow after the Ordinary Level exam.
No student will be left out after O/Ls when these reforms come into effect, he said. He added that an independent Supervisory Board would be appointed soon to supervise the learning and teaching methods and physical resources of all schools including the private and international schools.

The Dream In the Draw
Complimentary polenta bites were served to my table with a relish, followed by my order of the magnificent Italian Flag,which is a trio of my three favourite pastas: lasagna (red), gnocchi (white) and ravioli (green).
The food was so authentically Italian that it was hard to believe, surrounded by stunning Sri Lankan batiks, that I had not been teleported to Italy. Between courses, one can shop from the handy craft stall installation by the Italian style show kitchen, which includes wonderful hand painted wedding couples - something Galle Fort is famous for being a backdrop to and also a chef with an oversized hat. The lovely hand loom toys, bags and artisan gifts are simply stunning and are just a small selection of what the owner sells in her two shops on Pedlars Street.
An amazing demonstration
For anyone who fancies a change from curry after circumnavigating the island and loves Italian food and wickedly delicious desserts then nowhere could be more fun for a night out or just a cheeky lunch with a friend than The Pasta Factory. To get there, head through Odels on Pedlars Street and then cross the road at the back of the shop and you will find The Pasta Factory on the opposite side at 16/1, Leyn Baan Cross Street, Galle Fort. Coming from the other way, walk along fashionable Church Street past the Fort Bazaar hotel turn right into Leyn Baan Cross Street and look for the big black warehouse-style doors or just follow the delicious smells from the kitchen. Just make sure you pick up a bottle of wine along the way as nothing beats a glass of wine with pasta and as there is no corkage fee this just adds to an already great value restaurant.
Paola, the owner, is a delightful Italian lady well known for her love of gorgeous fabrics and food, now brings to the fort her authentic family ancestral recipes. She loves to chat to the restaurant guests explaining all the different pasta and sauce combinations and little stories about life in the old city, where she married into a wonderful Sri Lankan family, who have been trading in gemstones since the 1930s. She explained that her business partner from Italy is her uncle Arnaldo and before they opened he came over and trained the team for three months in how to make real hand made pasta. After the meal, she gave me an amazing demonstration on how to hand make the tagliatelle. I really had no idea it had to be folded so many times before it was cut to perfection and the freshly made Bolognese sauce added to it. One can watch the chef making the pasta every day and the saucy sauces that have made the restaurant jump into the Amangallas top five places to eat list in Galle, which is amazing in such a short space of time and bearing in mind there are over a hundred other venues to pick from.
Great sayings
The Pasta Factory opens at ten oclock every morning serving freshly made cakes and real Italian coffee with creamer and is a great place to order a take out, if going sightseeing for the day, as they add a complimentary special treat with every order. Paola, who has a son, also caters for childrens taste buds with an excellent kids menu at prices that make it affordable for the whole family to go there for dinner. The staff are full of fun and great sayings like the ones on the walls Make each daya story worth telling. They also have lots of dishes for both vegetarians and vegans, of which the aubergine parmigiana is a run away success story.
For those who like to live life and understand the true meaning of passion, this is a restaurant that serves hand made pasta from Paolas grand mums recipes that beautifully match the ancient traditions of this trading port and island that Marco Polo said was the finest one of its size in the world. Had he discovered The Pasta Factory he might have added a place that makes the finest handmade Italian food in the world. So, go on and try the Italian Flag and finish off with the orgasmic tiramisu and see if I am lying!

Emergency services to be further modernised - Rajitha
The system of transporting accident victims to hospitals will be further modernised with the addition of 209 ambulances to the existing service, increasing the number of Sri Lankans employed in the service by 1111, adding another 400 ambulances to state hospitals etc, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, eight helicopters and 24 emergency vehicles will be obtained from Germany to strengthen the existing accident victims transporting system, by adding transport facilities by air.
He was addressing the ceremony held in Colombo recently in connection with the expanding of the `Suva Seriya' Indian ambulance service.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that annually the majority of accident victims die due to the delay that occurs during transporting them to hospitals through roads blocked with traffic. Earlier the victims were transported to hospitals by three wheelers and now they are being transported by ambulances. This is a victory of this Good Governance Government.
"Annually around 25,000 Sri Lankans die from road accidents and during the past, a total of 58,441 accident victims had been transported to hospitals by Indian ambulances. A total of 489 Sri Lankan youths are employed in this service and it will be increased up to 1,600 soon.
They will receive specialized health care training in India.
What the Government Medical Officers' Association said about this service has been proved wrong," he added.

A few days into the New Year..!
Its still just a few days since the new year crept into our lives, no lambasted its way through fireworks and parties, and as I lifted pen to paper, nay finger to key board, the pen and paper days are over, arent they I wondered what I could put across today. What message for you my dear readers this morning I pondered awhile and what came so strongly to me were words spoken by writers of yore. Words meant to still and lift and inspire, words that have stood the test of time. These thoughts I give you this New Years Week:
Sad is the day for any man, says Philip Brooks, when he becomes absolutely satisfied with the life he is living, the thoughts he is thinking and the deeds he is doing; when there ceases to be forever beating at the doors of his soul a desire to do something larger, when he seeks and knows he was meant and intended to do..!
Says John Masefield:
Sitting still and wishing
Makes no person great.
The Good Lord sends the fishing
But you must dig the bait.
Booker Washington shouts:
Success is to be measured not so much by the position one has reached in life, as by the obstacles which he or she overcomes while trying to succeed.
Longfellow in measured tones whispers:
Not in the clamour of the street,
Not in the plaudits of the throng
But in ourselves are triumph and defeat.
Ella Wheeler Wilcox beckons, she also has lines for you.
One ship drives east and another west,
With the self same winds that blow:
Tis not the set of the sails, and not the gales
Which decides the way we go.
Like the winds of the sea are the ways of fate,
As they voyage along through life
Tis the will of the soul
That decides its goal
And not the calm or the strife.
I end with lines penned by an unknown author:
Every morning this brand new year,
Lean they arms awhile upon the windowsill of Heaven,
And gaze upon the Lord..
Then with that vision in thy heart,
Turn strong to meet the day..!
With these words I wish you all not just a happy, meaningful year, but also a year when you put your best foot forward, when you strive to achieve the impossible, when your body wants to give up, but not your mind, when you feel you are not up to it, but you plod on, and then dear friends let these the words of the ones before us, ring and blaze a trail in our minds and remind us that in ourselves is triumph and defeat; not in circumstances, not in people around us, but in our own true selves, even as we gain strength by gazing on the vision of the Lord..!

The Government ValuersAssociation yesterday urged the government to implement the Treasury proposals to restructure the Valuation Department.
Government ValuersAssociation President Nilantha Ekanayake called on the government to streamline and update its functions to increase efficiency for the betterment of the country. Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday,he said these proposals were sent on December 12, 2014 by the Treasury, but they have not been implemented so far.
"Cabinet approval has already been obtained and senior officials can do the needful.But, this has not still happened due to the close connection between private valuers and the certain senior officers. Their plan is to give the valuation role to the private sector and render the Department useless.However, if there is no proper solution for our demand, we will continue our trade union action further, he added.
Government Valuers Associations General Secretary D.M.Seneviratne said the protest is continued for a 44th day demanding the government to implement the restructuring process. Government valuers should be increased to 500 from the sixty valuers working at present, he said.

Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated that the President and the Prime Minister are ready to take action against offenders attached to the current government.
He said so during a meeting with employees of the Sapugaskanda oil refinery.
I had a great desire to establish a consensus government. The SLFP harassed the UNP when the SLFP won and vice versa. I have experienced these harassments. But our government has altered this culture by turning to a new path. This year we had to pay the highest debt. We are trying our best to manage debt payments without burdening the people, he said.
Our government and the Cabinet have dedicated to solve the debt issue. The President and Prime Minister have led the country on a new path together with all political parties in the East and West without discriminating Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims, he added.
I am disappointed about not punishing wrongdoers. However, the President and the Prime Minister are taking action against offenders attached to our government too, Minister Ranatunga added.

## Title: The GSP impact on Sri Lanka

The GSP impact on Sri Lanka
In March 2017, European Union (EU) approved the grant of GSP Plus facility, a much awaited response by Sri Lanka Government since it had been temporarily suspended. This decision of the EU created a blissful environment in Sri Lanka. But in the latter part of December 2017, United States had declared the grant of GSP benefits for Sri Lanka and another 120 nations would end on December 31, 2017.
Now time is ripe for Sri Lanka to examine how the new global tendencies like fluctuations and changes in GSP facilities are liable to affect Sri Lankan exports.
In Early 1960s, the main dialogue in international trade arena was to remove trade barriers and open avenues of opportunity for developing and least developed countries for entry into trade with developed countries. The offer of tariff preferences by developed nations to developing countries and least developed countries as the best gateway to have trade relationship with developed countries was proposed by The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The Generalized System of Preferences or GSP System was introduced in 1968 by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) on its initiative to encourage industrialized countries or developed countries to grant Autonomous Trade Preferences to all developing countries in accordance with the recommendation of UNCTAD.
From early 1970s developed countries or industrialized countries such as European Union- EU (1971), Japan (1971), Norway (1971), Switzerland (1971) New Zealand (1972) Australia (1972) United States of America - USA (1974), Belarus (1992), Russian Federation (1992) and Iceland (2002) implemented their Generalized System of Preferences or GSP System in offering trade preferences to developing and least developed countries.
Developing countries and least developed countries recognized as beneficiary countries are offered preferential tariff reductions for their export products to developed countries under GSP System. It is a removal of partial or entire tariff charges for goods exported by beneficiary countries.
In 2005 EU introduced special incentive arrangements under EU GSP scheme called GSP Plus and Everything But Arms (EBA) treatments. Under the Everything But Arms (EBA) treatment of EU GSP forty-nine Least Developed Countries receive duty-free quota-free access for all their products except arms and ammunition.
Beneficiaries countries
GSP Plus, the hot favourite topic among Sri Lankans during the last few years was introduced by EU in 2005 under EU GSP Scheme as special incentive arrangements. The special feature of this scheme is all the eligible products under this new scheme could be exported by selected beneficiary countries to EU totally import duty zero or duty free. The beneficiary countries are able to expand their export to EU better than the scenario they enjoyed under standard GSP scheme come since 1971. Under the standard GSP the products from beneficiaries countries have been imported in to EU not totally duty free, but reduction of normal import duty rates.
In standard GSP, the main important factor considered by Donor countries is, if the Receiving countries respect mainly the labour rights. But in GSP Plus, the beneficiary countries should mainly confirm and effectively implement 27 core international conventions on human and labour rights, good governance etc.
Since early 1970s Sri Lanka has been enjoying the GSP benefits from donor countries. Even though the GSP facility is offered by all these donor countries, Sri Lanka is more concerned on EU and USA GSP facilities because Sri Lanka exports 57% of its total exports to these two markets. While Sri Lanka was enjoying GSP, Sri Lanka was able to become a beneficiary country under the special scheme GSP Plus introduced by EU in 2005. The special feature was the offer of benefits was limited to a few countries only to ten to fifteen countries.
It was in December 2009 that EU decided to withdraw temporarily the GSP Plus benefits to Sri Lanka on the basis of findings of an exhaustive Commission of Investigations launched in October 2008 and completed in October 2009. However after the long discussions, EU finally decided to grant of GSP Plus benefits affecting from May 2017 temporarily suspended in early 2010.
It is hard to understand why high priority is given to GSP of EU in political agenda of government, when similar trade concessions are approved by certain other countries as USA and Norway.
In policymakers of Sri Lankan government also have highlighted that the EU decision has caused a heavy blow to export trade specially garment sector with the closure of several garment factories amounting to a loss of nearly US $ 800 million of exports last few years. Now it is clearly visible that the key player in the GSP facilities for Sri Lanka is garments.
Sri Lankas main products that exported under USA GSP are rubber products, Gloves mittens and mitts mixed with rubber or plastic. It is obvious that Sri Lankas exports last year was approximately US$ 300 million worth of items which covers only 10 % of total exports to USA under USA GSP facilities. This clarifies the demand for EU GSP Plus.
GSP facility
Today EU has become the leading business dealer of the International Trade with nearly 4000 billion Euro trade. EU consists of 28 powerful Western Nations having 500 million population and high purchasing power. The EU has achieved a strong position by acting together with one voice on the global stage, rather than with 28 separate trading nations. Even if Sri Lanka enjoys GSP facility with other developed counties, EU is recognized as the major player who provides more benefits not only from one country.
On the other hand the most of Sri Lankan leading export products to EU are included among the 7000 products eligible for EU GSP. It should be noted that all apparels categorized under HS tariff Code 61, 62, and textile code 63 except a few items are permitted for export under EU GSP facilities. Footwear, tunas, other sea foods, ornamental fish, some variety of cut flowers and foliage, black tea, gherkin, rubber items, activated carbon, table ware, wooden products among the Sri Lankan export products of supply capability are in eligible list of EU GSP. This shows that approximately 90% of Sri Lanka exports to EU are exported under GSP PLUS or Duty Zero entry to EU.
There has been no progress in export trade as proved by the export figures during the last few years. Political leadership and the officials claim as an excuse that it was the withdrawal of GSP Plus of EU affected the export. But now that GSP Plus has been granted by EU. It needs to walk the walk against the tendencies and not talk the talk.
Brexit is a subject that requires thoughtful discussions. The decision of UK to quit EU could create another unfavourable situation for Sri Lankan export trade.

HR recommendations not implemented: HRCSL
The Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka (HRCSL) yesterday stated that a significant proportion of their recommendations were not implemented by government officials.
HRCSL Chairperson Dr. Deepike Udagama, addressing a media briefing held at the Commission in Bambalapitiya, noted that around 30 - 40 percent of their recommendations resulted in non-compliance.
The main reason for this is the legal culture of our country. If we do not have a penalty or punishment, it is hard to enforce the law- this is entrenched in our society, she said.
The HRCSL, which is an independent Commission, only has the power to make recommendations, and they are not legally binding. The Commission also has no powers to directly take recommendations which have not been implemented in Courts.
In a law abiding society, our recommendations would be followed but many of our government officials do not follow the law, said Dr. Udgama.
This year, however, the Commission is to work on ways in which the recommendations can be made more binding. Dr. Udagama explained that consultations held with public officials had provided them with a possibility of amending the Establishment Code to allow strict disciplinarian action be taken against public officials who do not comply with their recommendations.
We have said in certain places that if they do not comply, we would report them to the Public Services Commission, added HRCSL member and Presidents Counsel Saliya Peiris.
The Commission, from January - September 2017, had received 5,614 complaints and has thus far resolved 2015 of them. Dr. Udagama explained that of the number that was resolved, 713 had plaintiffs not showing up for cases, recommendations were given on 83,247 had compensation granted, 195 were settled within the HRCSL, 306 were withdrawn, 25 sent to other government institutions for further inquiry and 105 were closed because they had legal proceedings in Court. We have seen a great interest in people coming forward to complain about human rights violations in the last year, said Dr. Udugama. As a result, the Commission is to open seven new branches in Nuwara Eliya, Ratnapura, Puttalam, Moneragala, Polonnaruwa, Mullaitivu and Galle (sub office) to cater to the demand.

India face fierce examination  in South Africa series
CAPE TOWN: India's status as the world's number one Test team will face a fierce examination when they come up against second-ranked South Africa in a three-Test series which starts at Newlands on Friday.
South Africa will be banking on their formidable fast bowling attack to dismantle India's strong batting line-up but after nine successive Test series wins India are brimming with confidence -- and a belief that they can thrive in any conditions.
Six of India's winning series were played at home and the others - two in Sri Lanka and one in the West Indies -- were in conditions where fast bowling was not a major factor.
The last time India lost a series was when they were beaten 2-0 in Australia in a four-match contest in 2014/15 but it was a series which showed India's batsmen could stand up to raw pace on hard, bouncy pitches.
They scored more than 400 in each of their first innings, losing the first two Tests before drawing the last two.
The tour to Australia is the one that laid a great foundation for this team, said Indian captain Virat Kohli during his arrival press conference last week.
Kohli hit four centuries in that series and it marked the start of his captaincy, initially in a stand-in capacity in two of the Tests in Australia but afterwards on a full-time basis when Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from Test cricket.
India have a poor record in South Africa, losing five out of six series with one drawn, and winning only two out of 17 Test matches against eight defeats and seven draws.
Significantly, though, they have pushed South Africa hard on their two most recent tours, in 2010/11 and 2013/14, sharing the first series and narrowly losing the second.
Thirteen of the 2013/14 tourists are in the current party and they are a vastly more experienced squad who have become accustomed to winning.
Both teams have selection dilemmas.
South Africa have to make room for returning captain Faf du Plessis in their batting order and will have to decide on their best bowling line-up.
Fast bowler Chris Morris will vie with medium-pacer Andile Phehlukwayo as an all-rounder to augment an expected pace attack of Morne Morkel, Vernon Philander and Kagiso Rabada.
India have to choose between Lokesh Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan as an opening batting partner for Murali Vijay, while in pace-friendly conditions there may be room for only one specialist spinner, meaning that one of Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja, a match-winning combination in India, could miss out.
Squads: South Africa: Faf du Plessis (captain), Dean Elgar, Aiden Markram, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Theunis de Bruyn, Vernon Philander, Chris Morris, Andile Phehlukwayo, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Dale Steyn, Morne Morkel.
India: Virat Kohli (captain), Murali Vijay, Lokesh Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Wriddhiman Saha (wkt), Ravichandran Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Parthiv Patel (wkt), Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah.

The Kirama divisional hospital is on its death bed. About 400 patients arrive at the OPD at this hospital and there are about sixty inmates at this hospital. There is an acute shortage of doctors nurses and minor staff at this hospital.
According to the sources at this hospital, there is no place to keep the dead bodies. The dead bodies have to be kept in the wards where patients are, until they are removed by the kith and kin.
The well from which drinking water is pumped to the hospital remain polluted. There are no facilities for the performance of post postmortems and as such, dead bodies have to be transferred to Katuwana and Walasmulla hospitals. The hospital has no proper kitchen and cooking is being done in a small hut that is similar to a cattle shed.
This hospital has remained as a central unit. But as of now, as a divisional hospital it needs a place to keep the dead bodies.
Plans are under way to allocate funds this year to set up a mortuary and a kitchen from the World Bank funds.
There aren't enough pharmacists and dispensers at this hospital presently.

MAHESH GOONATILLEKE a stylish gloveman
There were wicket keepers that the country produced before and after gaining Test status who were top class and who could have equaled or outshone leading glovemen in world cricket.
Before cocking a snook at our detractors - the lords at Lords and being admitted a full member of the International Cricket Council, great men who wore the big gloves and stood with distinction were Ben Navaratne, Telus Fernandopulle, Mahes Rodrigo, Dr. H.I.K.Fernando, Ranjit Fernando and Russel Hamer.
After entering the portals of the big league came MAHESH GOONATILLEKE, Guy de Alwis, Amal Silva, Romesh Kaluwitharne, Kumar Sangakkara, Prasanna Jayawardene and Gamini Wickremasinghe. GOONATILLEKE although his stint in the game was short, he has legend status.
Wicket keepers of class
Scanning through the names it will be noticed that down the ages the country had produced wicket keepers of distinction whose work behind the stumps were astonishing, clever, stylish, safe and sound and were the pride of the country.
Wicket keeping is no easy job. It requires that the WK concentrates every minute and every ball. What is funny is that when slacks for a moment in concentration that snick is made, a stumping or a run out comes the wicket keepers way.
In addition a wicket keeper has a big responsibility and that is this : He has to read how the wicket is playing, whether it is conducive to pace or spin and proffer advice to the captain on how he should make the bowling changes. So it will be seen that the job of a wicket keeper is not a bed of roses.
Style and efficiency
Now to the first wicket keeper that Sri Lanka produced and stood behind after the country gained Test status and did so with great style and efficiency in the Inaugural Test against England at the P.Sara Stadium was MAHESH GOONATILLEKE.
GOONETILLEKE learnt his wicket keeping skills at St. Anthonys College, Kandy, captaining the school in 1971 Those in the know of what wicket keeping was all about, saw in GOONATLLEKE, the manner in which he performed that a star has been born.
After donning gloves for the Peradeniya University, he joined the Colts Cricket Club on the invitation of a stalwart at the club and former Antonian opening batsman Ranjit Samarasekera who ended up as President of the club and also served on SLC in various positions.
One if not the best
This stylish wicket keeper who some saw him in his early years predicted that he had the talent of being one if not the best in the business in the country. After playing in four Tests and six one dayers, he had his career nipped in the bud when he decided to tour Apartheid South Africa with a rebel team that toured the Protea country in 1982.
That tour stunned the local cricket world because teams were banned from touring the Apartheid country. With Sri Lanka babes in Test cricket, it upset the apple cart and rocked the boat and the end result was that those who toured were slapped a ban for life.
That Rebel team that shamed the country needs mentioning.
It was led by Sri Lankas First Test Captain Bandula Warnapura and the other members were  Mahesh Goonatilleke, Lalith Kaluperuma, Ajit de Silva, Anura Ranasinghe, Flavian Aponso, Hemantha Devapriya, Lantra Fernando, Nirmal Hettiarachchy, Susantha Karunaratne, Bernard Perera, Bandula de Slva, Jerry Woutersz and Tony Opatha who was player/manager.
Has no regrets
However GOONATILLEKE has no regrets. On that tour he was delighted to meet some big name in South African cricket who could not show their superb talent on the world scene because the country was isolated from international sport due to the inhuman Apartheid.
When I toured South Africa with the Sri Lanka under-25 cricket team covering the tour for the DAILY NEWS  and SUNDAY OBSERVER with photographer K.D.S. Gunesekera, I experienced what Apartheid was all about, although by that time the inhuman system had ended, yet practiced on the sly.
We were having our lunch in the company of the driver of the bus who was a black. Once lunch was over, the driver wanted the white guy who was serving the food to parcel the remnants for him to take it home.
Mans inhumanity to man
What happened and what we saw next which was disgusting and a taste of Apartheid was to see the white guy dumping the remaining food in the thrash basket instead of offering it to the driver.
Mans inhumanity to man.
GOONATILLEKE has no regrets that he made that tour. He says he was looking for an opening to earn more money and also see a new country.
On that tour he enjoyed meeting the big names in cricket in Vincent van der Bijl, Barry Richards, Jimmy Cook, Graeme Pollock and Clive Rice. They were all tremendous players and contesting them was an experience. Incidentally Pollock was one of the greatest left hand batsmen that the game has seen.
Allan Knott his idol
GOONATILLEKES idol was Englands wicket keeper Allan Knott. He admits he tried copying Knotts style and it did him no good and his advice to all wicket keepers is not to try to copy any one, but to believe in ones natural talent.
After the ban was removed GOONATILLEKE served as a selector and also helped in developing talent where he worked with Romesh Kaluwitharne and Kumar Sangakkara, GOONATILLEKE a graduate does not take money from the players he trains. He has a successful garment business and lives a happy and contended life.

Only two captains for three formats says chief selector
Mathews and Chandimal to lead Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka cricket in future will have only two captains for the three formats  Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal.
In recent times Sri Lanka appointed three different captains for Tests, ODIs and T20Is, but that decision didnt work out well with the country going through one of their worst years in one-day cricket in 2017 losing 23 of 29 ODIs and 15 of 20 T20Is.
To add more salt to the wound Sri Lanka went through 2017 with as many as six captains in the two formats ODIs and T20Is at different times.
Sri Lanka Cricket yesterday made a statement to the effect that they would announce its limited overs captain on January 9 following a discussion held on Wednesday by SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala, SLC vice president in charge of international cricket K Mathivanan, SLC CEO Ashley de Silva, chief selector Graeme Labrooy, Sri Lanka cricket manager and selector Asanka Gurusinha and head coach Chandika Hathurusingha.
During the discussion the chairman of selectors informed me that they are considering appointing either Angelo Mathews or Dinesh Chandimal to fill the role, Sumthipala was quoted in the press statement.
Labrooy told the Daily News yesterday that they were looking at appointing only two captains for the three formats and it would be between Mathews and Chandimal. Both players have captained their country on different occasions across all three formats.
We want to appoint a captain long term who can take us through till the 2019 World Cup. It could be a captain who will lead in the Tests as well as the ODI side or a captain who will captain the ODI and T20 sides. We have pushed back in taking this decision until January 8 as there are a few things we need to discuss before making the final choice, said Labrooy.
At present Chandimal is the Test captain and considering Mathews history with injuries, Chandimal may even be handed the ODI captaincy as well, with Mathews asked to lead the T20 side. Mathews who pulled a hamstring during the third T20I against India last month is expected to undergo a fitness test on January 7.
In the event, the selectors who were to pick the ODI squad for Bangladesh today have postponed it till January 8 when they would name the ODI captain who will then sit with them to select the ODI team.
All-rounder Thisara Perera led Sri Lanka in the recently concluded ODI and T20I series in India that Sri Lanka lost by 2-1 and 3-0 margins respectively.
Sri Lanka are due to leave for Bangladesh on January 13 to participate in a tri-nation one-day series with Bangladesh and Zimbabwe.

Meltdown and Spectre: All Mac devices affected says Apple

Apple has said that all iPhones, iPads and Mac computers are affected by two major flaws in computer chips.
It emerged this week that tech companies have been racing to fix the Meltdown and Spectre bugs, that could allow hackers to steal data.
Apple said it had already released some patches but there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. But it advised only downloading software from trusted sources to avoid "malicious" apps.
Mac users have often believed that their devices and operating systems are less vulnerable to security issues than, for example Android phones or computers running Microsoft systems.
But the Meltdown and Spectre flaws are found in all modern computer processing units - or microchips - made by Intel and ARM, and together the firms supply almost the entire global computer market.
All Mac systems and iOS devices are affected, but there are no known exploits impacting customers at this time," Apple said in blog post on the issue. "These issues apply to all modern processors and affect nearly all computing devices and operating systems.
" Apple said that it had already released "mitigations" against Meltdown in its latest iPhones and iPad operating system update - iOS 11.2 and the macOS 10.12.2 for its MacBooks and iMacs.
Meltdown does not affect the Apple Watch, it said, as the bug was an issue with Intel processors which are not contained in that device.
Patches against Spectre, in the form of an update to web browser Safari, will be released "in the coming days".

Microbiology - all about Microorganisms
Microorganisms as biocontrol agents in agriculture
Piyumalie Lakma HettiarachchiThird Year, Faculty of Science, University of Colombo
In Sri Lankan agriculture industry the most outstanding and most troubleshooting problem is the supplement of sufficient amount of crop yield according to the customers need. The higher increment of the price in the market for some crop cultivators is caused by the increasing population and the lack of the supplement that the market needed.
Some of the problems that can be said as causes for this issue are natural disasters that destroy the cultivated crops during the seasons, insects damage, storage problems, transportation problems, lack of nutrients, lack of relevant equipment and resources etc. Many European countries who cultivate certain crop items in large-scales, have the major problem of the crops being attacked by several pathogenic microorganisms which lead to severe diseases to the plants. So they have the technology and research knowledge on overcoming pests damage using microorganisms as bio control agents.
Biological control is a method of controlling pests such as insects, mites, weeds and other plant diseases using other organisms. This method can be improved as an important role in integrated pest management. So using friendly microorganisms, these pathogenic microorganisms and the diseases can be maintained and managed. There are so many studies and researches which are based on testing the potential of the microorganisms which can be used as bio control agents, exploring their properties against fungi or bacterial activity and their ability to boost plant defense mechanisms.
For example, Micromonosporasp is a bacterium which can be used against the fungi Botrytiscinerea, which cause the gray mold in Tomato. Actually, this necrotrophic pathogen also causes the softening in fruits and gray mold in many vegetables, which leads to the removal of tremendous amount from the cultivated crop yields from the market. This Micromonosporasp induces the systemic resistance in tomato plant against the Botrytiscinereas activity. This bacterium can be used in reducing the negative effect of pathogens in plant, inhibiting pathogen growth by production of antibiotics, lytic enzymes or siderphores or induce plant defense mechanisms.
By introducing this Micromonosporasp in to the soil near to the roots or in to the leaves of the tomato plant it, induces the Jasmonate Acid regulated responses, which is a natural defense mechanism that occurs on plant at the presence of the pathogen fungi. The most interesting consequence is that this Micromonospora sp. (bacteria) would not harm the Tomato plant at the absence of the pathogenic fungi. So without any chemical interference, the pest can be controlled easily. So this method is a much healthier and ecofriendly manner in pest and disease control.
In the present, Sri Lanka is also trying this technology on Tea. The scientists have been shown the antagonistic fungi and bacteria that parasitize pathogenic fungi and destroy the pathogen in one of several ways. This effectively increases the crop yield at the harvesting mechanism, which improves the quality of the final product. Its very important to enhance the quality as well as the final crop yield of the Tea, as it is one of the main export crops to the international market from Sri Lanka. So by using these microorganism intended technology, it easily reduces the huge monetary expenses on pests eradication. So its cost effective.
Practically it acquired huge chemical amounts to use in a large scale cultivated crop types to control the pathogenic microorganisms.So the bioaccumulation of certain chemicals on the environment is also increased and finally it would be toxic to the humans and environment too. It needs only few amount of fractionating friendly microorganisms instead of huge amount of chemicals for the process.It protects the biodiversity and natural enemies of the pest.
But the huge usage of the microorganisms without a control would lead to the appearance of new species. This disrupts the balance of the natural ecosystem and pesticides would bio accumulate in food chains. If the microorganisms are controlled well, this method would be the best in pest control and disease control of crop plants in a country like Sri Lanka.
Importanceof bacteria
Kalhari AshinsaThird Year, Faculty of Science,University of Colombo
Bacteria live almost anywhere imaginable from inside your intestines to the bottom of the ocean floor. In fact, bacteria are beneficial to humans in pharmaceutical industry, biotechnology, food industry, agriculture, ecologically, and other human activities.
Today, biotechnology shows a massive development. They use microorganisms such as bacteria to develop new drugs and vaccines. Antibiotics such as Erythromycin, Streptomycin, Vancomycin, Bacitracin are developing from biotechnology using different bacterial varieties. Vaccines like tetanus are made by inactivating the tetanus toxin of bacteria clostridium tetani.
Recombinant DNA technology has developed to produce teneticall modified organisms which
has desired characteristics such as resistance varieties to harmful agents, enhance food resources, produce valuable proteins like insulin and so on. Bacterial plasmids are used to produce transgenic organisms which has modified gene structure. Gene structure is modified by inserting new genes to bacterial plasmids. Bacterial plasmids act as vectors due to their faster growth rate, easy cultivation and handling.
Bioremediation uses naturally occurring bacteria to degrade or detoxify substances hazardous to human health and/or the environment. Bacteria utilize chemical contaminant as an energy source and through oxidation-reduction reactions, metabolize the target contaminant into usable energy forms for microbial metabolism. Byproducts of this metabolism are released back into the environment which are typically in a non or less toxic form than the parent contaminant.
Some of the bacteria are used as bio indicators. Especially Coliform bacteria such as Escherichia coli, pseudomonas, Enterobacter are used to monitoring water quality to identify fecal contamination of drinking water. Those indicator bacteria are not harmful to human health but are useful to risk identification.
When considering the bacterial effect in food industry, main issue of bacteria is food spoilage. But bacteria play an important role in food industry specially in dairy products and fermented food production. Fermentation of food increase self-life and add desirable flavors to it. Yoghurt is a commonly used from of fermented milk. Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophiles are used to produce acidity and desirable flavor of yoghurt. Cheese production involves lactic acid fermentation. This process has done by lactic acid fermented bacteria like Lactococcuslactis and Lactococcuscremosis. Countries like Japan and China consume number of fermented meat and fish products which are fermented using bacteria such as Pediococcus, Lactobacillus.
In agriculture, saprophytic and symbiotic bacteria add to the soil to improve soil fertility and provide nitrogen to the plants. Bacteria like Rhzobium, Nitrobacter, Azotobacter, Nitrosomonas involve in N cycle. They fix atmospheric N in the form of nitrogenous compounds in the soil. Then, plant can easily obtain those compounds for their growth.
So, according to above facts it can be concluded that there are lots of advantages from bacteria in different fields and only a small fraction cause food spoilage and diseases.
Microbial effects of food spoilage
L.T.C. SewwandiThird Year, Faculty of Science,University of Colombo
Food spoilage can be described as the process by which food quality becomes compromised and its edibility significantly reduced. It is the process leading to a product becoming either undesirable or unacceptable for human consumption.
Numerous signs are indicative of food spoilage and they range from changes in the ordinary appearance of the foods, changes in its texture, bad odour and poor taste. Microbiological food spoilage is caused by the growth of microorganisms which produce enzymes that lead to objectionable byproducts in the food. Bacteria, yeasts and molds are microorganisms that cause food spoilage. They produce various enzymes that decompose the various constituents of food.
Molds are the major causes of spoilage of foods with reduced water activity such as dry cereals and cereal products. Bacteria spoil food with relatively high water activity such as milk and milk products. The primary sources of microorganisms in food include; soil and water, plant and plant product, food utensils, intestinal tract of man and animals, food handlers, animal hides and skins, air and dust.
There are two types of factors that affect microbial growth food. They are intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors are inherent in the food. They include pH, moisture content, nutrient content of food, antimicrobial substances and biological structure of foods. Yeasts and molds grow under acid conditions. Other microorganisms such as Vibrio cholera are sensitive to acids and prefer alkaline conditions.
Most bacteria are killed in strong acid or strong alkaline environment except Mycobacteria. Moisture content is also important for growth of microorganisms. If there is lack of free water, microorganisms will not grow. Salting and drying reduces the water activity of a food product.
Nutrient content of the food also affect the microorganism growth. Microorganisms require proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, water, energy, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, vitamins, and mineral for growth. Various foods have specific nutrients that help in microbial growth. These foods are hence susceptible to microbial spoilage. Antimicrobial substances in food inhibit microbial growth. Various foods have inherent antimicrobial substances that prevent microbial attack. Such inhibitors are like actinin and anticoliform factors in milk and lysozyme in eggs.
Some foods have bilogical structures that prevent microbial entry. For example, meat has fascia, skin and other membranes that prevent microbial entry. Eggs have shell and inner membranes that prevent yolk and egg white from infection.
Extrinsic factors are factors external to the food that effect microbial growth. They include temperature of storage, presence and concentration of gases in the environment, relative humidity of food storage environment. The effect of temperature on microbial growth also depends upon other environmental conditions such as growth factors in the nutrient medium, pH of the food and water activity.
Concentration of gases in the food environment also affect to the microbial growth. Anaerobic or facultative anaerobic spore forms are most likely for growth in canned foods. Microaerophilic bacteria are most likely to grow in vacuum packed foods since they have low oxygen tension. Aerobic bacteria are likely to grow on the surface of raw meat. Aerobic molds will grow in insufficiently dried or salted products. Relative humidity is the amount of moisture in the atmosphere or food environment. Foods with low water activity placed at high humidity environment take up water, increase their water activity and get spoiled easily. Food preservation is a process through which physical and chemical agents are used to prevent microbial spoilage of food.
Food preservation aims at treating food in a manner to prolong its storage life.
There are two general principles that are employed in food preservation. They are inhibition and killing. In the inhibition principles, food preservation is achieved by inhibition of growth and multiplication of microogranisms. It is achieved by reduction of water activity by drying or salting. Reduction in pH is achieved by fermentation and addition of acids, use of preservatives such as sodium benzoate, use of low temperature by chilling or freezing and smoking.
In the killing principle, spoilage microogranisms are destroyed in the food, and the food protected against subsequent contamination by being enclosed in an air tight container. In this principle, food preservation is achieved by treatment through pasteurization or sterilization, irradiation and use of gases such as ethylene oxide or ozone.

Nishikori out of Aussie Open, Djokovic races clock
MELBOURNE Thursday: Injured Japanese star Kei Nishikori pulled out of the Australian Open Thursday, while Novak Djokovic says he will test his problem elbow at an exhibition before deciding whether to play.
Asian number one Nishikori has not played competitively since last August after suffering a torn tendon in his right wrist during a practice session at Cincinnati.
He said he still wasn't ready for a gruelling Grand Slam campaign.
I am very sorry to announce that I will miss the Aussie Open this year, he said on his website of the opening major of the year, starting in Melbourne on January 15.
The Aussie Open is my favourite Slam ... it's my 'home' Slam, he added.
It's the Slam that takes incredible care of the players and their teams, and it hurts that I will have to miss it this year.
My rehab is going well but I am just not ready 100 percent to come back yet in best of five set matches. Nishikori is not the only leading player struggling with injury, with a who's who of the top names in the game battling to be fit for Melbourne Park.
Former world number one Djokovic hasn't played since a right elbow issue forced him to quit Wimbledon in the quarter-finals in July.
He has already cancelled scheduled appearances at an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and the Qatar Open, and said he will test the injury next week at the Kooyong Classic in Melbourne and a Tie Break Tens tournament in the same city.
Novak is travelling to Australia where he will take part in two exhibition tournaments, said a statement on 12-time Grand Slam winner's website early Thursday.
After the two events, the decision will be made about his participation at the first Grand Slam of the season, the Australian Open, where 'Nole' has been crowned champion six times. Another former number one, Andy Murray, is also struggling and withdrew from this week's Brisbane International as he works to overcome a right hip injury which has sidelined him since Wimbledon.
The Scot raised the prospect this week of surgery, but still holds out hope of playing in Melbourne, saying he will decide by the weekend whether to stay in Australia or fly home.
Also returning from injury but set to play at the Grand Slam are Stan Wawrinka and Milos Raonic.
World number one Rafael Nadal, the reigning French Open and US Open champion, pulled out of Brisbane with a knee injury, but the Spaniard has said he still intends to be on court at the Australian Open.
The writing was on the wall for Nishikori, who also withdrew from Brisbane.
The 28-year-old, who reached a career high world number four in 2015, said in November he had chosen rehabilitation over surgery to repair the damage and was targeting a return to action in Australia.
His no-show is a major blow for the popular Japanese player, who concluded his 2017 season with a 30-13 match record.
The winner of 11 ATP Tour titles, he made the fourth round of the Australian Open last year, losing in five sets to eventual champion Roger Federer, who, aged 36, is one of the few top names to be fully fit.

Prof. Ashoka Ranwala and Dr. Nimal Karunasiri led the protest.Ranwala said his two children have also studied at Medical College and as a parents they are concerned for their children who sacrifice a lot in their lives to be doctors.
We reject outright the subcommittee and its recommendations and we believe the subcommittee will look into this crucial issue.It should be well represented with all the relevant expertise.
This subcommittee has no such representation, therefore we reject the recommendations given by this committee regarding the SAITM issue.In addition, we strongly believe that this committee is biased and partial.
The Sri Lanka Medical Council has no justifiable reason to produce this committee report to the Supreme Court or any other authority as it would further complicate this crisis.
The recommendations given by this committee contradict the government policy decision to abolish SAITM.The SLMC has no mandate to give recommendations for recognition of the SAITM degree.

Path to excellence in education
The year 2017 has come to an end and with the dawn of another New Year, if you are looking for a smart start for your child Sujatha Vidyalaya is the place. Established in the heart of Colombo and later in Nugegoda Sujatha Vidyalaya is known island wide and across the globe. Originally surrounded by lush greenery now consisting of intellectual high rises is a perfect educational institution in true sense of the word.
The quality branches, pre-school etc. showcase the how students are geared to excel in their education right from the very beginning. This is truly a place prone to family education filled with discipline.
Sujatha Pre-School
Sujatha Pre-school is situated in a welcoming, safe environment providing a solid foundational education, paving the way for successful study, work and progress leading to academic excellence.
Entire Sujatha Vidyalaya from Pre-school onwards is rated as the best in the area. However, admission to Sujatha has certainly become a major concern. There are many schools to choose from, in the vicinity. But the rush is for Sujatha Pre-school and Primary is nothing strange and now it has risen to the position of the most sought-after school in that area.
One can recall the wonderful education Sujathians received in Primary, Secondary and beyond with a very competent knowledge in English Language  a very rare feature of the day.
Starting with just 30 students way back in June 1965 Sujatha Vidyalaya was founded by late Linton Kuruppu, Pioneer and Architect joined by late Clara Motwani as the Principal both of whom devoted their lives for the task of setting up a school for Buddhist girls at a time that International schools were not even heard of.
It heralded the beginning of English medium education after the departure of Imperial Masters from then Ceylon.
The challenges faced by the duo was what made Sujatha Vidyalaya unique, to be carried forward by his son Lakshman Kuruppu who took over.
The demise of his father meant a lifetime commitment culminating in a wide awakening in education par excellence.
New Era
Being young and vibrant soon after his foreign education highly qualified, when he took over it opened the door to a new era.
Sujatha Vidyalaya has the cream of intelligentsia in large numbers on her roll today with a professionally qualified, wide academic staff with devotion and loyalty. With the dedicated service from top to bottom, it is at the top of all schools in the vicinity and the prestige is indeed a fitting tribute to the present Management. In his mission for quality education he has succeeded and Sujatha Vidyalaya today has made a mark in all round performance too numerous to be mentioned in detail.
It is with great pride that the old Sujathians remember their Alma-Mater. The name Sujatha is spread around the world, many serving in all walks of life. The past pupils are found leading the way in every field. Wherever they are, in any part of the globe, on top of their busy lives, to say that I am a Sujathian mean so much and it is kept up by them with utmost respect.

The United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) have suggested that a special Parliamentary session be summoned to debate the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate and inquire into the Treasury Bonds issue.

The manner in which the Bond issue was investigated and the commitment to identify those responsible demonstrated the democratic and law abiding nature of the Yahapalana National Government. We now hope that the Attorney Generals (AG) Department will do the same, said a statement released from the Prime Ministers Office.
The Prime Ministers Office further thanked the Presidential Commission on the work carried out for over 10 months.
President Maithripala Sirisena has already sent the report to the Office of the Attorney General.
Further on the advice of the Prime Minister, JVP MP Sunil Handunnettis COPE Committee report on the Bond issue released on October 31, 2016 has also been sent to the AG.
The Prime Minister in December 2016 asked the AG to take legal action against officers responsible for the irregular issue of bonds and the issues surrounding it, explained the statement.
Accordingly the AG has been directed to take action against the perpetrators of the bond issue, in December 2016 by the Prime Minister and the President in 2018.
The Yahapalana Government also plans to investigate and take legal action against those who have committed wrongdoings and engaged in corruption through the issuance of bonds from 2008, it said further.
It is our hope that instead of the mudslinging and campaign of misinformation carried out by the previous government, we would now have an environment where legal proceedings can be carried out in an independent manner, said the Office of the Prime Minister.

Political hand behind efforts to tarnish ACBC - Sumathipala
There is a political hand behind the efforts made to tarnish the image of the All Ceylon Buddhist Congress (ACBC), ACBC President Jagath Sumathipla said.
"The ACBC has not been involved in politics, but certain elements at present are trying to do politics in the ACBC," Sumathipla said.
Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, he said that there are efforts being made by a politically influenced group to gain a foothold in the ACBC.
"This group is alleged to have direct contacts with Non Governmental Organisations (NGO) working hard to destroy Buddhism, our ancient culture and the Sinhala people," Sumathipla said.
"We are sincerely dedicated to protecting the Buddha Sasana," he added.
According to the ACBC President, the proposed new Constitution should contain the word Buddha Sasana which includes everything, especially all relevant Acts and Ordinances.
"Article 9 of the current Constitution should be included in the new Constitution without any change," he said.
"Everything should be done with the consent of Maha Nayaka Theras. The existance of the ACBC has become an issue for some NGOs," Sumathipla said.
Sumathipala pointed out that the ACBC owns a number of lands and properties. It runs 25 Elders' Homes and Childrens' Homes. More people are donating lands to the ACBC because of the trust and confidence they have placed in it. Annually, the ACBC declares its assets and everything is being done in a transparent manner.
"I plan to contest for the ACBC election to be held dring the 91st Annual General Meeting which is scheduled to be held on January 6 in order to protect the ACBC from harmful elements," Sumathipala said.
"I held the post of ACBC President from 2006 to 2014," he added.

Presidents measures to mitigate fraud and corruption praised
United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) General Secretary and Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera praised the measures taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to mitigate fraud and corruption, especially to end monetary irregularities by appointing the Special Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue.
People in the country may not place their trust in Commissions unless the President appointed the Presidential Commission, he said.
Amaraweera was addressing the media at the SLFP headquarters in Colombo yesterday.
Apart from Minister Amaraweera, several other senior SLFPers including Ministers Sarath Amunugama, Sudarshani Fernandopulle, Faizer Musthapa and Northern Provincial Governor Reginold Cooray also praised the measures taken by President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a special Presidential Commission to look into the Treasury Bond issue.
Minister Amaraweera added that a proper mechanism should be implemented aiming to protect the Treasury.
He further said the report on the Treasury Bond issue, indirectly signifies that there should be such a mechanism so as to protect the Treasury and moreover not allowing anyone to misuse the Treasury and public assets.
They all added that appointing the special Presidential Commission is a novel feature in the countrys political arena. Moreover, it can be considered as a forward and fruitful measure to end corruption, he said.
It is significant that people are not familier with such a powerful and impartial Presidential Commission, which investigates into allegations without considering the positions of anyone.
For the first time in the countrys history, the Commission has suggested that any losses be claimed from the responsible parties, Amaraweera said.
As per the directives of the Commission further action will be taken by the relevant parties. However, the progress of the process will be monitored by a panel lead by the Secretary to the President.
Minister Amaraweera further said financial malpractices and fraud that had taken place from 2008 should be investigated.
Considering this situation, the commission has given directives on how the Central Bank Governor should be appointed in future, he said.
Another Commission to inquire into Mihin Lanka and SriLankan Airlines will be appointed by the President in future, Amaraweera noted.
Minister Sarath Amunugama said it is needed to inquire into financial irregularities that had taken place from 2008 in relating to the Treasury.

President initiates strategic offensive
Thursday (3) evening President Maithripla Sirisena making a special statement informed the nation about the findings and recommendations of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the Central Bank Bond issue, the report of which was presented to him on December 30, 2017.
The Commission was appointed following the exposure of an alleged fraud by the Parliamentary Select Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE), the Opposition and the public regarding the issue of Treasury Bonds by the Central Bank between February 01, 2015 and March 31, 2016.
The terms of reference of the Commission were to investigate and report to the President on what happened together with its recommendations. After 10 months of deliberations the Commission has submitted a comprehensive full report running to 1257 pages. The Presidents statement was based on the report has already been sent to the Attorney General for necessary action.
The proceedings of the Commission attracted much public attention and the report was eagerly expected by the entire society. Never has a Presidential Commission earned such wide public interest in recent history which shows a fair degree of maturity of the political consciousness of the masses. The best guarantee of the implementation of its recommendations likewise rests on the continued vigilance and interest of the masses concerning the issue.
Fraudulent activities
According to the Presidents revelations the brokering firm Perpetual Treasuries has earned by illegal means Rs. 11.5 billion during a short period of five months. The loss to the Government is estimated at Rs. 8.5 billion. They constitute funds of the National Savings Bank, the EPF, Mahapola Trust Fund and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Fund.
The Commission has recommended legal action against several persons involved in the fraudulent activities. They include former Minister Ravi Karunanayake, former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran, Kasun Palihena and several Bank officials et al.
Other recommendations of the Commission include the institution of civil and criminal legal proceedings to recover the brokering firm of revenue lost by the government and revision of relevant legislation to facilitate quick recovery. Costs incurred for the Presidential Commission are also to be recovered from Perpetual Treasuries.
It is proposed also to resort to the strategy of passing an Act of Parliament for expeditious recovery. Stressing the importance of better financial management, the Commission has recommended the early adoption of three new Acts by Parliament.
It has also found that secrecy and security at the Central Bank has been compromised. Hence it has recommended a complete overhaul of the Central Bank.
The repercussions of the Presidents statement in informing the public on the findings and recommendations of the Presidential Commission and referring it to the Attorney-General for necessary legal action President Sirisena has initiated a healthy tradition in the context of many unpublished reports gathering dust in the Presidential archives.
By doing so the President has proved wrong those sceptics who prophesied that the appointment of the Commission was an eye-wash to placate and deceive the agitated public. It should, however, be stated that in contemporary Sri Lankan politics nothing can be taken for granted and hence permanent public vigilance is necessary to ensure that further action will not be abandoned in the ensuing period on various pretexts.
Parliamentary elections
It is clear that the President has initiated an astute strategic offensive to consolidate his position just as the strategic decisions he took during the Parliamentary elections that favoured the continuation of the 100 day program, much to the chagrin of the UPFA. This is particularly evidenced in his timing of the move to coincide with the local government election period.
Though it is too early (less than 24 hours when this column is being written) to predict the repercussions of the Presidents move, we are tempted to comment on the effect it would have on political parties and the civil society in the short run.
The President has assured that his action is not against any political party and that he is only acting in accordance with the pledge given to the people to ensure the elimination of bribery and corruption. We have no doubt about his sincerity. However, the UNP would certainly be the loser for its stalwarts would be in the dock.
Any attempt to resurrect the sullied images of persons such as the former Finance Minister even among party circles would make matters worse.
Though the Prime Minister has escaped unscathed and the Commission has not found anything amiss in his recommendation of Arjun Mahendran to the post of Central Bank Governor, public perception of him as Mr. Clean has been dented at least marginally. The best course of action for the UNP would be to face the challenge boldly, clean its ranks of corrupt elements and cooperate with the President in establishing a corruption free political culture. Perhaps it would be asking too much!
Of course both wings of the SLFP would gain electorally from these developments. That would be in the short run. Despite the virulent opposition by the Joint Opposition under the command of the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa MP, lateral shift of allegiance from the SLPP to the Official SLFP headed by President Sirisena could be expected among the SLFP sympathizers.
Anti-bribery authorities
Much would depend on the Second phase of the Presidential offensive which relates to the findings of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption as well as an appointment of a Presidential Commission to investigate the issue of Treasury Bonds during 2007 to 2015 in which many frauds had been allegedly taken place.
Already reports of 34 inquiries conducted by the anti-bribery authorities have been sent to the Attorney General and some plaints have been already filed in Courts. This could deflate the popularity of the former President and a majority of prominent leaders of the JO. Thus, the long-term effect of the Presidents new strategy would be counter-productive for it. Till then they could revel on it just as the crabs that would dance in the pot until the water boils, as a local adage (natana se kakuluwa tek diya seliye) says.
The JVP would gain for it has been consistently fighting against corruption and has contributed much to these developments. However, how far this would be reflected in electoral gains is still a moot point. Perhaps the local government polls would be a pointer.
Tamil and Muslim political parties would not be much affected though a slight increase in their sympathy with the President could be expected and their relations with the UNP could be suspect among the rank and file.
Let us hope the Yahapalana government would awake from its slumber and pursue its promised agenda with vigour.

Profits, losses and year end stock-taking indices for bosses
The old year is over. We have seen it out with the renderings of Auld Lang Syne. Now its time to take stock of a new beginning. Salespeople and many others live and die by the annual review. Auditors have built an entire industry around it. For the next month, print and television media will pour out gallons of coverage of the past year in review.
And yet, as leaders, we often move from one year to the next with little or no time spent reviewing the year just past from a purely leadership perspective. Every business, division, department, project, group, or team ends the year with an often unspoken but widely accepted narrative: We messed it. Or We achieved it. Or possibly playing the blame game with: Our customer service team let us down. And another such as: The first three quarters were a failure, but the fourth wasnt too bad.
Your mileage will vary. Yet, as the leader, its your job to understand what narrative has taken hold in your team and to manage it accordingly. This isnt the same as PR or spin. Managing the narrative isnt about manipulating what people think. Its about knowing what has taken root in your teams perception and helping the team members understand its importance.
So as this year has already closed, what narrative has your group or team subliminally adopted How accurate is it Do you need to amplify or clarify any of it Does it need to be discussed as a group What lessons can you all learn from the narrative
Whether you have had your best year ever or the worst one imaginable, some, probably all, of your top performers will have been bent out of shape getting you through it. Some of them will have developed less than helpful traits - of arrogance, perhaps, or gruffness, or maybe just thoughtlessness. Some will be harbouring grudges or feeling hurt or confused. Others may have been blindsided by events and are finishing the year off their game. One or two may simply be exhausted.
If you are the top honcho keep one thing in mind. You are their leader. You need to go and straighten them out. In the course of any year, you will encounter a whole lot of individual and group dynamics that lose efficacy and that only you can un-tether. There may be several practices that have become outdated, policies that no longer work. There could also be routines, rituals, and habits that now just get in the way and meetings that have lost their purpose.
Ask for nominations of less-than-useful activities from your team, but make the final decision yourself. And make everyones life simpler by culling those that truly yield no ongoing benefit. During the year, you and your team will undoubtedly have used up one or more of the staples of healthy group interaction, such as energy, perhaps, or enthusiasm. Maybe as a team you have lost a sense of fun, humour, or maybe you have run short on objectivity or perspective.
Take a moment and think about it. Again, take soundings from your subordinates and colleagues. One way or another, you dont want to start the New Year with one or more of those staples missing from your teams pantry.
When you have identified which essentials are missing or have run down to dangerously low levels, think through how to restock in the next couple of weeks. Can you give the holiday retreat or your end-of-year address a theme Do you need to give your folks some mentoring or coaching or training Or just allow them a rest or offer a new perspective
So as we begin a new year and examine what new challenges and opportunities lie ahead, its a good time for all businesses to take stock and ensure that they have the right processes in place to effectively manage their business in 2018.
Its worth noting that while planning will help to keep your business one step ahead, there will be some events that are completely unexpected. The first step in preparing for the unexpected is to identify a comprehensive list of risks facing the business. At the start of this process, it would be a capital idea to schedule a risk mapping session involving all the significant people in the business.
Challenges are part of any business, but they also present an opportunity to build trust with your team and prove that honesty is truly a core value. Show your employees you respect them enough to be frank about your challenges, and trust them enough to give them new opportunities to re-invent or reinvigorate the business.
Every business has to face certain setbacks. But helping create an atmosphere of trust and collaboration to navigate through the rough patches pays rich dividends. Just as the organisation itself can provide clues to how the team operates, so does the behaviour of the team members. Do they behave as though they were responsible for the success of the organisation and their duties Are they trying to be helpful to others on the team
Examine your results for patterns. If people are willingly involved and energetic, and if they get to use their initiative, creativity and talents to solve problems for the team, then you are passing power along. On the other hand, if you dont empower team members and delegate responsibility to them, the patterns will be different.
The only way you can be successful as a leader is to engage the potential of everyone on your team. You must be ready, willing, and able to recognise the value that each employee brings to the table. Everyone will have different strengths and weaknesses, but each can play a crucial role.
Finally, what about you How have you changed as a leader this year Do some soul-searching. Draw a line down the centre of a page, and list in one column your defining characteristics at the start of the year, and in the other, your defining characteristics at the end of the year. How do the two lists differ, if at all
By using common courtesies, you demonstrate you respect the people with whom you are dealing. Even if you dont work in a customer service job, keep an attitude of customer service. Your colleagues and, more importantly, your superiors will begin to realise you are an accessible go-to person if you are almost always pleasant.
This year, how can you do more of the first characteristic and less of the second To run a company, you of course need to delegate, but pick your spots and continue to roll up your sleeves and become a hands-on top honcho on the job. You will see the entire organisation follow that lead.

Rain holds up WTA  Auckland quarter-finals
AUCKLAND: Players will have to contest both the quarter and semi-finals of the WTA Auckland Classic in one day after rain washed out play on Thursday.
Organisers were forced to hastily reschedule matches after the relentless weather washed out both the day and evening sessions. If the weather continues to disrupt the tournament on Friday, there was the prospect of playing the semi-finals and the final both on Saturday. We've done it before, tournament director Karl Budge told reporters.
There's been times where three matches have been played on a day as well. The worst case scenario was not finishing the tournament until Sunday, but Budge was hoping that would not happen We've just got to hope the tennis gods start being kind to us, he said.
Under the revised draw, and weather permitting, the quarter-finals will start at 10:00 am on Friday (2100 GMT Thursday) with the semi-finals at 5:00 pm.

Road Map 2018
Following is an extract of the text of the address made by Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy at the presentation of Road Map 2018, last Wednesday.
We are pleased to present the eleventh Road Map of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. It is our belief that sharing our future policy direction and actions would help you to plan your business trajectory with more certainty.
The year 2017 was challenging. We have seen economy-wide effects due to inclement weather conditions. The drought and floods disturbed agriculture activities and agro-based industrial activities. Spillover effects of these adverse weather conditions impacted the other sectors of the economy as well. As a result, economic growth is expected to be subdued and lower than we projected at the beginning of the year.
The tight monetary policy stance of the Central Bank as well as the relatively tight fiscal policy stance of the government, which were adopted with the aim of regaining macroeconomic stability, partly affected public and private investment spending that also contributed to low economic growth. Consumer price inflation increased, mainly due to high food prices associated with weather-related domestic supply disruptions, revisions to indirect taxes and increased prices of imported commodities, making our efforts to anchor inflation expectations challenging.
Despite the tight monetary policy stance maintained by the Central Bank, growth of monetary aggregates was high during most of 2017, before decelerating to envisaged levels towards the end of the year. Although we have seen signs of a firm recovery in exports with better prospects in key export markets and the flexible exchange rate policy of the Central Bank, the trade account continued to be affected by a largely weather-induced increase in import expenditure.
The decline in workers remittances resulted in a reduction in the cushion against the widening trade deficit in the external current account. Although the fiscal sector has recorded notable improvements in terms of revenue collection, some slippage in the budget deficit is likely in 2017 mainly as a result of weather-related fiscal costs and higher interest payments. This could have an adverse impact on achieving the envisaged fiscal consolidation path, while complicating the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies.
Despite these challenges, 2017 was a year when we made significant progress on many fronts through several policy measures taken by the Central Bank in coordination with the government. In response to these measures, macroeconomic stability is being restored and our economy is trending in the right direction.
FIT
The Central Bank has implemented several proactive policy measures during 2017 in order to achieve the core objectives of maintaining economic and price stability and financial system stability. Three frameworks have been put in place to improve the countrys overall macroeconomic conditions. Attention is also being paid to institutionalising them. The Central Bank is working towards implementing a Flexible Inflation Targeting (FIT) framework by 2020 to conduct monetary policy in a proactive and forward-looking manner. It has also adopted a more flexible exchange rate policy that promotes export competitiveness. The government is also committed to a revenue-based fiscal consolidation programme, which intends to bring down budget deficits and debt levels progressively. If we get fiscal policy and monetary policy right, then the pressure on the exchange rate would reduce. Let me discuss these frameworks in a detailed manner.
On the monetary policy framework, the Central Banks move towards introducing a FIT regime aims to maintain a low inflation environment on a sustained basis. The FIT framework is a data-driven, forward-looking and proactive monetary policy regime built upon three main pillars: strong fiscal policy support, effective monetary policy conduct, and strong central bank mandate and credibility. The government has also endorsed this move to adopt a FIT regime as stated in its Vision 2025 policy document.
In order to successfully implement the FIT framework, we have formulated a road map outlining several milestones to be completed by the government and the Central Bank, including the necessary legislative, institutional and operational changes. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recognised our move towards FIT by giving us necessary technical assistance on capacity building.
Exchange rate
The Central Bank accommodated greater flexibility in the exchange rate in 2017 by allowing market forces to determine the rate. The market reacted positively to this policy initiative by reviving the spot market. The Central Bank continued to absorb foreign exchange from the domestic interbank foreign exchange market in order to build up the quantum of non-borrowed foreign exchange reserves. This move also helped to smoothen the exchange rate behaviour.
There were even some instances of appreciation of the rupee in 2017, indicating significant inflows to the foreign exchange market. Sri Lanka also received the fourth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) of the IMF in December 2017. A total of US$ 759.9 million has been received so far. This confirms Sri Lankas satisfactory performance in achieving IMF-EFF targets during 2017 in terms of specified performance criteria and certain structural benchmarks. Earnings from exports increased owing to the recovery in key export markets, the Central Bank policy of maintaining exchange rate flexibility, conducive external trade policies and improved macroeconomic conditions of the country.
Further, the reinstatement of the EU GSP+ facility, the expected conclusion of the free trade agreements with Singapore, China and India and strong institutional and policy support are also expected to drive the momentum in exports.
We have seen an increased inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in 2017 and we expect FDI to gain momentum through the commencement of the Hambantota industrial zone and the continuation of the Colombo Port City project. Higher inflows to the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as well as long-term financial flows to the government were also witnessed during the year. With these developments on the external front, the Central Bank was able to build official reserves of over US$ 7.9 billion at the end of 2017.
Fiscal policy
On the fiscal front, the government has embarked on a revenue-based fiscal consolidation path to strengthen the countrys public finances. The government expects to reduce the budget deficit to 3.5% of GDP by 2020 and thereby reduce government debt to a sustainable level in the medium-term.
It is in the process of implementing several reforms aimed at improving government revenue collection while rationalising government expenditures to adhere to the envisaged fiscal consolidation path over the medium-term.
A positive primary balance is expected in 2017 for the first time since the early 1950s and a surplus in the current account is also expected in 2018 for the first time since 1987. The reform agenda of the government includes improving financial viability of the State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) to mitigate the budgetary implications for the government.
Financial sector
While introducing clear frameworks and reforms in relation to monetary and exchange rate policies in 2017, we have implemented several policy measures during 2017 to address the challenges in the financial sector and maintain a stable financial system for effective monetary policy transmission and to support sustainable growth. With a view to promote a dynamic and resilient financial sector, the regulatory and supervisory framework of the Central Bank was further strengthened in line with international standards and best practices. At present, our banking sector accounts for over Rs. 10 trillion in assets, while the non-bank financial institutions sector accounts for over Rs. 1 trillion in assets.
The implementation of Basel III capital standards was commenced in 2017 in order to develop a more robust banking sector. The framework to regulate the non-bank financial institutions was strengthened under challenging conditions, and resolution of distressed finance companies was also commenced.
During 2017, the Central Bank continued to strengthen the regulatory framework for the microfinance sector, and continued to combat the menace of illegal pyramid schemes with the assistance of other government agencies. Several measures were adopted to strengthen and modernise the payment and settlement infrastructure in order to develop an efficient and stable payment and settlement system in the country, as well as to pave the way towards a digital economy.
Being a trusted, professionally competent and strong institution, the Central Bank is entrusted with vital agency functions. Accordingly, as per our mandate, we carried out public debt management with the objective of mobilising the governments financing requirements at the lowest possible cost and with a prudent degree of risk. The framework for public debt management was reinforced by introducing a transparent market-based auction mechanism for the issuance of government securities.
This has already resulted in desirable outcomes of lowering interest costs to the government, efficient price discovery and improved transmission of monetary policy signals across the benchmark yield curve. The Employees Provident Fund, which is the largest superannuation fund in the country, is managed by the Central Bank. It passed a significant milestone during 2017 with total assets of the Fund surpassing Rs. 2.0 trillion.
The Central Bank also continued to promote financial literacy and inclusiveness and helped entrepreneurship development through our credit schemes for agriculture and livestock, as well as the micro, small and medium scale enterprise (MSME) sectors. In addition, we also adopted measures to promote a clean note policy in the country and improvements were also made in currency operations and processing.
In 2017, the Central Bank implemented a new legislative and a policy framework for foreign exchange operations based on the Foreign Exchange Act, No. 12 of 2017. Provisions of the new Act are being implemented through the newly established Department of Foreign Exchange in the Central Bank focusing on reducing restrictions, excluding ambiguities, simplifying processes and enhancing efficiency associated with foreign exchange transactions while striving for clarity and convenience.
A significant amount of work needs to be done to improve Sri Lankas global ranking in the implementation of Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations. The Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank is taking several measures to address this with the assistance of key government Ministries and Departments as well as stakeholders such as Licensed Banks, Licensed Finance Companies, Regulators, Stock Brokers and Insurance Companies, and continued to enter into new MOUs with other country FIUs.
The Central Bank has already initiated several measures to enhance the economic stability of the country and it will continue with this endeavor in the future as well. Given improved economic fundamentals and stability, it is expected that the government will implement the necessary policy reforms to uplift the economy from the prevailing low growth trajectory to reach its potential level. The governments Vision 2025 unveils the future policy direction of the country.
The Vision envisages transforming Sri Lanka into a hub of the Indian Ocean, with a knowledge-based, highly competitive, social-market economy. Accordingly, considering the limited scope of the domestic market, sustained future economic growth would have to be generated from external demand. Hence, effective and sustainable long-term policy measures have to be implemented for accessing foreign markets through exploiting trade and investment opportunities.
We also observe that frequent natural calamities hamper economic activity resulting in a moderation of economic expansion. This highlights the need for diversification of growth drivers in the economy as well as putting the necessary measures in place to strengthen the economys resilience through mainstreaming sustainability into the planning and budgeting processes and improving disaster preparedness.
In the global context, after having a series of economic distortions and negative shocks after the Global Financial Crisis, now the global economy is gradually recovering. Investment conditions have improved and global trade also rebounded in 2017. So, we need to exploit opportunities created by the revival of global growth supported by synchronized economic expansion in Europe, Japan and the US for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis.
Better prospects in Europe and the US, which are our two largest markets, are clearly tailwinds. This is growth positive for Sri Lanka. However, we should also be mindful that gradual normalisation of monetary policies in the advanced countries could pose some challenges to the economy on both external and fiscal fronts.
Sri Lanka is gradually transforming to upper middle income economy status. Sustained progress will inevitably involve greater integration with the world economy. While creating opportunities, this will also expose the economy to greater uncertainties and risks. In order to face the current and future challenges proactively, and to address the already identified deficiencies in the existing processes, the Central Bank, as outlined in its latest Strategic Plan for the medium term, expects to robustly strengthen its institutional frameworks by: a) enhancing the monetary policy framework; b) strengthening the financial sector oversight; c) modernising payment and settlements; and, d) upgrading public debt management.
The improved policy frameworks will enable the country to take advantage of greater integration, while mitigating the risks involved and increasing the resilience of the economy.
In this respect, as already mentioned, we are steadily progressing towards an effective FIT framework to ensure price stability. At the same time, we are striving to promote a dynamic and resilient financial sector in order to lower vulnerabilities in the financial system. This is a priority for achieving objectives in relation to growth, employment and incomes.
Modernising the infrastructure of the payments and settlements system to pave the path towards a less cash society and facilitating a digital economy are also important policy priorities in the medium term. We are also determined to strive for prudent debt management with a view to ensure debt sustainability, enhance effectiveness and transparency of the primary auction system, promote market development and minimise risks.
Price stability
The Central Bank is entrusted with the task of maintaining price stability. Price stability remains a key fundamental in fostering an environment conducive for sustained growth and securing rising living standards for the people.
The Central Bank seeks to achieve its price stability objective through the conduct of monetary policy. Based on the current monetary policy framework, we have been able to maintain inflation in single digits for close to a decade.
Going forward, the introduction of an effective FIT framework will improve our capacity to deliver price stability. This will provide a more propitious environment for growth and employment generation. Our motivation towards adopting inflation targeting as the monetary policy framework was signaled a number of years ago, as we recognised it as the most appropriate way to escape from the high inflation-low growth trap.
The weakened relationship between money and inflation and deepening financial markets were among the major factors that encouraged this move.
Under the proposed FIT framework, the Central Bank will aim to preserve price stability of the economy by targeting an inflation range of 4-6 per cent.
We believe that this target range is desirable for a country like ours in view of the vulnerability of the economy to supply or external shocks. We will employ market-based instruments, particularly the policy interest rates and open market operations (OMO) of the Central Bank, to influence market conditions and to navigate inflation in the targeted mid-single digit range.
Variables such as overall monetary expansion and credit disbursements to the private sector by commercial banks will remain as key indicative variables to guide monetary policy conduct. We have now progressed into a time-bound plan to make this leap towards FIT a reality. The period starting from 2018 will be vital in laying out required reforms to facilitate a smooth transition to a FIT framework.
In this context, we have identified three important pillars as the building blocks for adopting a FIT framework; 1. Strong Central Bank mandate and credibility 2. Effective monetary policy conduct 3. Strong fiscal policy support and commitment.
Liability management
We also see the proposed Liability Management Act of the government as a prudent strategy. It allows the government to manage public debt in a more flexible manner. Under this framework, the public debt manager would create a buffer fund to minimise the rollover risk of debt stock
eliminating the necessity for the Central Bank to provide financial assistance to the government at the beginning of each year as per the current provisions of the MLA.
Even more importantly, it will create the space to go beyond the governments borrowing requirement in any given year to mobilise financing to address the current bunching of external debt payments from 2019. The governments decision to earmark the proceeds of divestitures for liability management is also a very favourable development in this regard.
SOEs
The governments commitment to reform state owned enterprises (SOEs) is commendable. In particular, automatic pricing mechanisms for fuel and electricity are expected to be introduced in March and September 2018, respectively. This will go a long way towards reducing the future financial losses of key SOEs and avoid large ad hoc adjustments in retail prices.
Not only will this be supportive of the effective conduct of monetary policy, but it will also have a positive impact on the balance sheets of both the government and the state banks.
Policies for 2018 and beyond
Being guided by its mandate, the Central Bank promotes a dynamic and resilient financial sector, which supports sustainable growth, primarily through regulation and supervision of financial institutions, ensuring sound and safe payment and settlement systems, establishing risk management systems and instilling good corporate governance standards and practices in the financial sector.
Falling in line with international standards and best practices, the Central Bank has introduced several policy reforms, in 2017, to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework relating to FIs under the purview of the Central Bank thus ensuring financial system stability.
It is also noteworthy to mention that we have re-established the Financial System Stability Consultative Committee (FSSCC) in 2017 comprising reputed and well-experienced professionals, experts as well as the representatives from the institutions and regulatory bodies in the financial sector. Inputs of the FSSCC are helpful in devising appropriate decisions for maintaining financial system stability.
Going forward, there is an overarching need to amend the Banking Act to ensure that the banking sector is guided by legislation which sufficiently accounts for the change in the sectoral landscape and the challenges that may arise as the sector rapidly grows and evolves, across the country and beyond. The Central Bank is proactively working with all relevant stakeholders of the banking sector and looks forward to finalising a new Banking Act in the near-term.
Strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking sector remains at the centre of our financial sector policy. As such, we are continuing to upgrade and enhancethe bank examination methodology to ensure that the focus of examinations is not entirely a rule-based one that concentrates only on compliance, but also one which gives due consideration to the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability of individual banks and the entire banking sector. Accordingly, initiatives are underway to assign ratings to banks based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative indicators that will assess their efficiency and sustainability.
During the course of this year, we expect to finalise the bank examination methodology based on the Bank Sustainability Risk Index (BSRI) to facilitate the transition from an annual on-site examination approach to a risk-based supervision approach. Further, we intend to incorporate BSRI to examination reports of all licensed banks and assign a supervisory rating grade for banks with effect from 2019, on a staggered basis.
Over the last five years, while the banking sector has grown approximately by 15% annually, the non-bank financial institutions sector has grown approximately by 20per cent. Although the sector accounts for a comparatively small share of around 8 per cent of the total assets of the financial system, the rapid growth and broad outreach of the sector necessitate proactive supervision and regulatory guidance.
While several regulations have been introduced to strengthen these institutions, some licensed finance companies have shown signs of stress, while the rapid expansion of certain others have been curtailed due to their lack of compliance with regulatory requirements.
This reiterates the need for continued strengthening of the existing regulatory framework of non-bank financial institutions to ensure the soundness of the sector and ontain its spillover effects on the whole system. Initiatives are already underway to resolve such weaknesses through mergers and recapitalisation of such finance companies through strategic investors.
It should also be mentioned that in addition to the Board of Directors, the senior management of these institutions are also equally responsible for the operations of the institutions.
ERM
While we make every possible effort to put other financial institutions in order,we have to put our own house in order. In line with this, implementing an Enterprise-wide Risk Management Framework (ERM) and strengthening compliance in the bank have been identified as one of our strategic priorities. In line with new trends in central banking in the area of risk management, implementation of an ERM framework helps to move away from a silo based approach to a whole of business approach to risk management.
ERM enables the integrated oversight of all risks across all levels, locationsand departments using a uniform approach with consistent foundations and organisational arrangements for designing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing and continuously improving risk management throughout the Central Bank. This will support more informedand risk-aware decision-making at the top, while strengthening the risk mitigation culture, enhancing internal governance, optimising risk management cost, and promoting efficient use of resources, while building confidence of stakeholders and the community at large.
Public Debt Management
We consider prudent debt management as one of the highest priorities given the challenge of managing a very large debt stock, while maintaining a proper mix between domestic and foreign financing. In fact, to break away from a potentially vicious cycle of debt, the Central Bank has made prudent debt management a bank-wide strategic priority in its mission to ensure debt sustainability.
As you all know, the Central Bank is responsible for raising, managing and servicing of government debt and carries out its functions with the objective of ensuring that the governments financing requirements are met at the lowest possible cost in a timely manner, while ensuring the sustainability of debt obtained on behalf of the government. Following what was outlined in the previous Road Map, several measures were implemented in 2017 to enhance the transparency of debt management operations.
In July 2017, a new hybrid primary issuance system for Treasury bonds was introducedtoenhance the efficiency and transparency of the domestic borrowings of the government. We have also published an issuance calendar for government securities in the Central Bank website on a rolling basisto improve the transparency and predictability of the primary auction process and government securities market. Looking ahead, in 2018, we will continue to work towards enhancing the security, efficiency and transparency in public debt management further.
Subject to the enactment of the Liability Management Act,in early 2018, liability management measures will be executed in order to improve the underlying risk profile of the public debt stock. This would enable us to minimise the refinancing risk by altering the maturity profile of the outstanding debt stock. Also under this initiative, activities such as buy-back, switching and pre-funding arrangements will be explored, not only to increase tenor, but also to reduce cost.
Most importantly, we will take all steps necessary in the medium-term to establish a credible term structure of interest rates enabling to build up a long-term yield curve, while also smoothing the structure of debt. This would help reduce debt vulnerabilities. We have had a clean and unblemished track record with regard to debt repayment in the past. This must be continued and every effort will be made to do so.
EPF
As you all know, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, as the safe custodian, is vested with all powers and responsibilities pertaining to management of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Being the largest superannuation fund in the country, the EPF passed a significant milestone during the year with total assets of the Fund surpassing Rs. 2.0 trillion.
It has grown at a compounded average rate of around 13 per cent during last 5 years. Several measures were taken, in 2017, to improve the overall quality of the services provided to members by way of streamlining operational activities. This was achieved by accelerating the automation process for collecting member contributions, real-time updating of member accounts and swift payment of refunds.
Notable improvements were also made to services offered for employers in their submission of EPF returns via an electronic platform, while we also partnered with a few licensed commercial banks to offer their EPF paying customers the facility to remit their member contributions online.
In addition, several measures were taken to enhance the accountability and transparency of the investment process with greater emphasis on improving the governance structure of fund management, including the establishment of an independent, internal department for risk management. Further, the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank was obtained to improve internal processes in line international best practices. As in the previous years, we have continued to provide members with the highest possible returns on their fund balances through profitable, yet prudent investments.
Forex management
Following the successful implementation of proposals announced in the Road Map for 2017, a new foreign exchange management framework was introduced in order to implement government policy.
Accordingly, the Department of Foreign Exchange was established in place of the Exchange Control Department to implement provisions of the new Foreign Exchange Act.
In addition, we have implemented several policies for further relaxation of capital transactions in 2017. The foreign exchange policies to be implemented in 2018 and beyond are basically focused upon facilitating integration with the current overall policy stance of the country which seeks to promote competitive advantages for Sri Lanka in the global business environment.
With the view of introducing an effective monitoring mechanism, a new real time reporting and monitoring system is to be introduced for authorised dealers and restricted dealers in order to create a better database for macro-economic decision making through identifying patterns related to mobilisation of foreign exchange flows. Offsite surveillance will be strengthened as a part of the reporting requirement with the view of tracking and reducing non-compliances to improve market discipline.
Regional Development
The Central Bank continues to execute many concessionary development credit schemes through Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs), with a view of providing refinance facilities, interest subsidies and/or credit guarantees and credit supplementary services targeting development of agriculture and livestock, micro, small and medium scale enterprise (MSME) sectors, improving the financial inclusion and promoting balanced regional growth in the country. In order to strengthen effective credit delivery and to broaden the outreach of the formal financial sector, several loan schemes were introduced during 2017.
Further, the Central Bank facilitates all sectors of the economy by enhancing flow of credit and credit plus services and provision of non-financial support to achieve sustainable development and create a conducive financial environment to bring-in under-served segments of society to the formal financial sector.
Priority is also being attached to develop a National Financial Inclusion Strategy for the country. In addition, we plan to automate activities that pertainto registration of loan applications of borrowers and processing of refinance applications of PFIs and to focus on enhancing the efficiency of credit delivery mechanisms, thereby expediting the flow of credit to the needy sectors of the economy.
Going forward, the improved credit delivery mechanism along with other non-financial support extended will considerably enhance regional development efforts of the Central Bank. These efforts will also support achieving the goals of the National Food Production Programme of the government. ERM enables the integrated oversight of all risks across all levels, locations and departments using a uniform approach with consistent foundations and organisational arrangements for designing, implementing, monitoring, reviewing and continuously improving risk management throughout the Central Bank. This will support more informed and risk-aware decision-making at the top, while strengthening the risk mitigation culture, enhancing internal governance, optimising risk management cost, and promoting efficient use of resources, while building confidence of stakeholders and the community at large.
Public Debt Management
We consider prudent debt management as one of the highest priorities given the challenge of managing a very large debt stock, while maintaining a proper mix between domestic and foreign financing. In fact, to break away from a potentially vicious cycle of debt, the Central Bank has made prudent debt management a bank-wide strategic priority in its mission to ensure debt sustainability.
As you all know, the Central Bank is responsible for raising, managing and servicing of government debt and carries out its functions with the objective of ensuring that the governments financing requirements are met at the lowest possible cost in a timely manner, while ensuring the sustainability of debt obtained on behalf of the government. Following what was outlined in the previous Road Map, several measures were implemented in 2017 to enhance the transparency of debt management operations.
In July 2017, a new hybrid primary issuance system for Treasury bonds was introduced to enhance the efficiency and transparency of the domestic borrowings of the government. We have also published an issuance calendar for government securities in the Central Bank website on a rolling basis to improve the transparency and predictability of the primary auction process and government securities market. Looking ahead, in 2018, we will continue to work towards enhancing the security, efficiency and transparency in public debt management further.
Subject to the enactment of the Liability Management Act,in early 2018, liability management measures will be executed in order to improve the underlying risk profile of the public debt stock. This would enable us to minimise the refinancing risk by altering the maturity profile of the outstanding debt stock. Also under this initiative, activities such as buy-back, switching and pre-funding arrangements will be explored, not only to increase tenor, but also to reduce cost.
Most importantly, we will take all steps necessary in the medium-term to establish a credible term structure of interest rates enabling to build up a long-term yield curve, while also smoothing the structure of debt. This would help reduce debt vulnerabilities. We have had a clean and unblemished track record with regard to debt repayment in the past. This must be continued and every effort will be made to do so.
EPF
As you all know, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, as the safe custodian, is vested with all powers and responsibilities pertaining to management of the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Being the largest superannuation fund in the country, the EPF passed a significant milestone during the year with total assets of the Fund surpassing Rs. 2.0 trillion.
It has grown at a compounded average rate of around 13 per cent during last 5 years. Several measures were taken, in 2017, to improve the overall quality of the services provided to members by way of streamlining operational activities. This was achieved by accelerating the automation process for collecting member contributions, real-time updating of member accounts and swift payment of refunds.
Notable improvements were also made to services offered for employers in their submission of EPF returns via an electronic platform, while we also partnered with a few licensed commercial banks to offer their EPF paying customers the facility to remit their member contributions online.

Root falls short  of elusive century  as Aussies hit back late
SYDNEY: England skipper Joe Root again missed out on an elusive first century in the series as Australia fought back with two late wickets on the opening day of the fifth Test on Thursday.
Root was out to a superb diving catch by Mitchell Marsh at square leg for 83 in the day's penultimate over before Jonny Bairstow was caught behind in the final over.
Root slumped to his haunches in dismay after missing out on a hundred following his fourth half-century of the series.
Root and Malan recovered England's first innings with a 133-run stand after the tourists had slumped to 95 for three following the loss of Melbourne double-centurion Alastair Cook.
Malan lived a charmed life in his half-century, surviving a run out attempt and a dropped Steve Smith catch to provide stoic support for his skipper.
At the close, England were 233 for five with Malan left unbeaten on 55 off 160 balls when Bairstow was caught behind off Josh Hazlewood for five.
Root reached his half-century off 82 balls cover driving Mitchell Marsh for four, but Malan was fortunate not to be run out two balls later.
Malan, on 28, cut towards backward point and there was confusion over the run with Root steaming down the pitch and Malan stuttering and then setting off for the non-striker's end.
But the throw from wicketkeeper Tim Paine was off target and bowler Nathan Lyon was unable to effect the run out with Malan well out of his ground.
Malan had another life on 34 when Smith dropped a sharp ankle-high chance at slip off Lyon.
Only last week in Melbourne Smith put down two catches in Alastair Cook's unbeaten double century.
Cook, who carried his bat through the England first innings in the fourth Test for an unbeaten 244, looked on his way to another big score until Josh Hazlewood struck in the 33rd over.
Hazlewood's leg before wicket appeal was turned down on-field, but on review the ball was found to be just pitching in line with the left-hander's leg stump and hitting middle and Cook was given out for 39 off 104 balls.
It was the third time in the series Cook has fallen lbw and it left him just five runs short of 12,000 career Test runs in his 152nd Test match. Fellow opener Mark Stoneman earlier hit some nice drives among his four fours before he nicked a rising Pat Cummins delivery to Tim Paine for 24 off 24 balls in the 10th over. James Vince looked set after 82 minutes at the crease before he shaped for a square cut at a wide Cummins delivery only to be caught behind for 25 in the 29th over.
Usman Khawaja jarred his left knee as he carved out a large chunk of topsoil in sliding to prevent a boundary off Malan in the 56th over but returned to the field later. Australia have already clinched the Ashes with an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-Test series. England are bidding to break through in Sydney, where they have won twice in the last four Ashes Tests. After a rain delay and an early lunch, play finally got under way at 12.40pm (0140 GMT).

SAITM issue resolved
The government has resolved the issue surrounding the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe.
The government has proposed the setting up of two institutes, one of which will absorb all SAITM students. The other will consider new enrolments for a fully-fledged MBBS degree.
The nine member committee chaired by National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, tasked with finding a pragmatic solution to the abolition of SAITM, have cited that the legal process requires the creation of two new institutions.
A new not-for-profit sunset institute will the absorb all students who were enrolled in SAITM medical degree programme, as well as is assets and liabilities.This institute will cease all operations once the last current batch of students graduate from this institute and no new students will be enrolled.
Thereafter, a new not-for-profit sunrise institute will start enrolling students from 2019 onwards. The government has already entered into an MoU with SAITM and the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) for the setting up of these two institutions. Once the Attorney Generals Department approves this, the MoU will be converted into a legal agreement.
Based on the agreement, SLIIT will establish the new institutes under the guidance of the government which will take over the ownership and management of SAITMs assets, liabilities, staff and students.
The sunset institution will be approved by the SLMC in accordance with the Minimum Standards.The SLMC is to specify further measures (clinical training and assessment in state hospitals) necessary for students who have received degrees from SAITM, to meet these Standards and thereby gain Provisional Registration.
Both institutions will not operate for profit, the committee states.
The sunrise institution will be a company limited by guarantee that charges fees, but re-invests any excess income over expenditure in the institution, including in the provision of scholarships based on financial need.
In addition to the above, the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital will be transferred to the Health Ministry, allowing the State medical sector to gain a Rs. 3.2 billion asset at no cost to the State.
These legal measures was proposed by the nine member committee on the heels of a Presidential communique calling for a pragmatic solution which is legally acceptable to the current shareholders, so lending institutions and new entities may take over all operations, management and assets so to provide a degree which complies with the Minimum Standards on Medical Education and Training.
This proposed solution, according to the committee, resolves many issues surrounding SAITM which included allegations that SAITM does not meet the necessary or satisfactory standards to award a medical degree.There were also allegations that SAITMs profit making motive averts the goal of creating good doctors.

Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) yesterday filed three writ petitions in the Supreme Court naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents. This is regarding rejection of its nominations in respect of three local government institutions.
In one writ petition, SLPP secretary Sagara Kariyawasam is seeking a writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Maharagama Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the SLPP authorised agent for the election of members to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The SLPP also filed two other petitions in the Supreme Court in respect of Mahiyangana and Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabha.
The nomination papers handed by the SLPP in respect of Maharagama Urban Council were rejected on the ground that it did not contain the total number of women candidates in terms of subsection (2A) of section 28 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance. At a previous occasion several candidates contesting the Maharagama Urban Council had filed a separate writ petition over the same issue.
The SLPP is also seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Maharagama Urban Council, Mahiyangana and Agalawatta Pradeshiya Sabha.
The petitioners cited Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Colombo, Badulla and Kalutara Districts), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and two other members of Election Commission, SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake,UNP General Secretary Kabeer Hasheem, JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva and several others as respondents.

SLTB strike cripples North
Sri Lanka Transport Board (SLTB) bus operations in the North came to a halt on Wednesday, as workers from the six other bus depots in the North also joined the Vavuniya bus depot workers who launched the strike from Monday.
The strike commenced following a decision made by Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Vigneshwaran to close down the SLTB bus terminal in Vavuniya.
SLTB workers in the Vavuniya bus depot expressed their unwillingness to relocate to a new bus terminal which was built at a cost of Rs.200 million. This had apparently prompted the Chief Minister to close the SLTB bus terminal.
Although several attempts were made to commence bus services from the new bus depot, they were unsuccessful owing to issues between private bus employees and employees of the SLTB.
Chief Minister C.V. Vigneshwaran ordered that all bus services be moved to the new depot from January 1. Private bus operators are also reluctant to move to the new bus terminal.
Bus operators in both private and SLTB are now holding discussions to resolve this problem and they expect to find a solution through Courts today.
Meanwhile, relevant parties will meet the Chief Minister of the Northern Province C.V. Vigneshwaran today to discuss the matter.

Sri Lanka has guaranteed equality of employment -Ranawaka
Sri Lanka is far ahead of some western countries where equality of employment opportunities and salaries between and male and female is concerned, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He made this observation pointing out that one of the leading news in the international media yesterday was that females salaries was tallied with males in Ireland.
He added it was a main topic since until then, males there were granted a higher salary than females though they engaged in the same employment.
So we are proud to declare that there has never been such discrimination here, Minister Ranawaka said. Even though those countries are developed, they stand backward in history when equality is concerned.Even in countries like Switzerland though developed, females do not have franchise at the local government elections in their country.
He made these observations at an event held at the Bandaranaike Memorail International Conference Hall (BMICH).
He also pointed out that when a student is admitted to a school for free education, the race, religion, creed, caste or the gender of the applicant are not of concern. He added that the same scenario is applied when one is recruited for employment.
Minister Ranawaka further said that it was a fact that although Sri Lanka was not economically sound, yet it is on par with the developed world where education is concerned. He added that the best results at GCE Advance Level always reported outside Colombo.
The credit of this democracy in education cannot be bestowed to Education Ministry only, Minister Ranawaka said. The private education sector should enjoy the credit equally.

Thomas and Spieth  Tournament of Champions favourites
LOS ANGELES: Reigning British Open champion Jordan Spieth and fellow 2017 major winners Justin Thomas and Brooks Koepka are among contenders in the US PGA Tournament of Champions opening Friday in Hawaii.
Defending event champion and 2017 PGA Championship winner Thomas, US Open champion Koepka, Spieth and long-hitting Dustin Johnson lead a set of US stars into the 34-player field at Kapalua for the first US event of 2018.
The unknowns are very exciting right now, Spieth said.
Spieth cited a new group of rising stars, a solid group of veterans and even the latest comeback of 14-time major winner Tiger Woods in his excitement for the new year.
With the amount of depth and talent at a younger age mixed with the guys in their 30s that are playing... some other phenomenal players that you would call maybe in prime and then the major question, which is whats it going to be like with Tiger coming back, within the next six months, its a pretty special time to be a part of professional golf, Spieth said.
Global challengers include Japans Hideki Matsuyama, Spains Jon Rahm, Australians Marc Leishman and Cameron Smith, Swedens Jonas Blixt and South Korean Kim Si Woo.
The field boasts an average age of 29.7 years, the youngest since at least 1970.
Thomas won last years Tournament of Champions and the following weeks Sony Open in Hawaii plus his first major title on the way to collecting the US PGA Tour FedEx Cup playoff crown.
The Plantation Course at Kapalua played as the easiest course on the US tour last season.
Its just a great way of, not easing into the year, but get the year going, because of how relaxing it is, Thomas said. The course is great. There are obviously some great places to eat. And who doesnt like being in Hawaii Spieth, who shook off memories of a final-round 2016 Masters meltdown to claim his third major crown last year at Royal Birkdale, says he has turned a corner mentally entering the new year.
Starting 2018 Im kind of ready for anything, Spieth said. Im ready for failure, for success, and everything in between. Spieth has two wins and two runner-up efforts in his past eight events and three top-three finishes in his past three Maui starts. And hes engaged to long-time girlfriend Annie Verret.
Im just in a fantastic place compared to where I was last year, Spieth said.

Tourism, promising field for investments - Japan FM
A business delegation comprising nearly 100 members from the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry will visit Sri Lanka this month to explore investment opportunities, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in an exclusive interview with the Daily News Business.
Through various exchanges including this business delegation, I expect to further increase investment from Japan to Sri Lanka, he added.
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono arrived in Sri Lanka for a two day official visit yesterday evening. This is the first time in 15 years that a Japanese Foreign Minister is visiting Sri Lanka.
Kono said the tourism sector in Sri Lanka was a promising field for investments.
I understand that the tourists who visit Sri Lanka from abroad have been on the rise especially after the end of the conflict in 2009. In recent years, the number of Japanese tourists has also increased to more than 40,000 per year, and I think the tourism sector in Sri Lanka is a promising field for investments, he said.
Kono added that annual bilateral trade between Japan and Sri Lanka exceeds 100 billion Japanese Yen (approximately Rs.170 billion) and more than 130 Japanese companies are currently present in Sri Lanka.
He predicted that these figures will continue to grow with more Japan supported business on the pipeline.

Trump scraps election fraud inquiry
US: President Donald Trump on Wednesday disbanded an investigation into alleged voter fraud in the 2016 election, but refused to back down on unsubstantiated allegations of massive wrongdoing at the ballot box.
Facing opposition from US states and an uphill battle to prove something that almost all experts agree did not happen, Trump ditched his controversial panel of inquiry.
But the president did not seem to completely abandon his unproven claim that between three million and five million people voted illegally in the 2016 presidential election.
Despite substantial evidence of voter fraud, many states have refused to provide the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity with basic information relevant to its inquiry, Trump said in a statement.
Rather than engage in endless legal battles at taxpayer expense, today I signed an executive order to dissolve the Commission, and have asked the Department of Homeland Security to review these issues and determine next courses of action. Trump won the election because he garnered more state electoral college votes, but lost the popular vote by around three million votes.
The Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity raised alarm bells when its vice chair Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, sent a letter to all 50 states asking for sensitive information on all registered voters. Kobach sought names, addresses, date of birth, party affiliation, the last four digits of social security numbers, military status, data on felony convictions and voter history.
Some states rejected the White House request, warning the information could be misused in voter disenfranchisement efforts.
Trump -- who had also raised the specter of voter fraud prior to the election that brought him to office -- sought to cast the refusals as evidence of a potential cover-up.
Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide he wrote on Twitter last year.- AFP

Two different cultures merged into one
Kathak originated from the tradition known as Katha. The Sanskrit lexicon defines Kathak as storyteller or narrator of drama. According to certain historical evidence, Kathak dance came into being from a particular social community named kathak, who were the custodians of this dance form. Professional story-tellers of this caste dramatised the epic and religious stories with full expression, miming and acting.
Today, Kathak is regarded as a classical dance form of North India. It has been influenced by Hindu and Moghul cultures. It reached the peak of its achievement during the 16th and 17th centuries. According to historical evidence, this art flourished in and around temples and temple environs. With the passage of time, it blossomed out of the Vaishnava cult and adopted certain chosen styles and techniques.
As in most Indian dance forms, even in this dance form Devadasis (the handmaids of God) played an important role. During the period of Moghul rule, the rulers thought if these temple dancers could dance before the temple deities, why they shouldnt dance in the royal courts. The rulers used force to bring them to the royal courts to dance. Due to economic difficulties, the dancers too agreed to dance at the royal courts.
On some occasions, Persian dancers were brought down to India to impart some nuances to this dance form. The Kathak dance was originally based on Rasa Lela. With the passage of time, this dance form was further polished, alloyed and developed into a distinguished dance form.
Kathak also like most of the other Indian dance forms originated as a temple dance, but soon moved to the courts of the Moghul emperors princelings. As in Bharatha Natyam, it has Nirtta, Nirtya, and Natya in equal measure. The dancers are experts in music, dance and storytelling. During the time of the Moghul emperors, it flourished in and around Delhi, Agra and Lucknow.
There is a general belief that there are two popular traditions in Kathak, just as the so-called four styles or four schools in other classical Bharata Natyam. But today, the more popular traditions are Lucknow and Jaipur and the less well-known traditions being Varanasi and Rampur. Yet, different traditions have their own grace, elegance and beauty, so too in Kathak different traditions have their own identity.
Like all other Indian dance forms, Kathak too has different styles. The different styles or schools are known as Gharanas in Kathak. As in classical Bharatha Natyam, the so-called styles were developed by the gurus stationed in different areas.
The styles are imaginary creations of the masters who developed certain aspects of the dance. For the development of Kathak, males have contributed much. Unlike Bharatha Natyam, from the initial days, the males also performed on the stage. Kathak male and female dancers have different and distinguished costumes of their own. Kathak also originated in temples. Later, it developed in the royal courts. During the 19th century, Kathak faced a new era.
Wajid Ali Shah contributed meaningfully to the development of Kathak. He was an excellent musician, gifted poet and an exceptional dancer. It is said that during this period, Kathak, reached its peak. The king also learnt the dance from Wajid Ali Shah. During his regime, the Lucknow Gharana (style) of Kathak developed. Thakur Prasad and his two sons Kalka Prasad and Binda Din served in Wajid Ali Shahs royal court. Binda Din was a gifted poet and his brother Kalka Prasad, a tala exponent.
Binda Din composed beautiful lyrics on Radha-Krishna themes. Later, Kalka Prasads three sons AcchanMaharaj, LacchuMaharaj and ShambuMaharaj, received their training under their uncle Binda Din. With the passage of time, under their guidance beautiful verses, rhythmic syllabus and melodious musical compositions were introduced. This gave birth to the Lucknow Gharana.
Another Kathak style is known as Jaipur style. It originated in Rajasthan. Graceful and expressive Bhava, are the predominating characters of this Gharana. Yet, this Gharana also uses maximum footwork. A special feature of Kathak is that the dance movements even in high tempo are enriched with bhava, rasa, and abhinaya. It is generally believed that the Jaipur Gharana, originated in Rajasthan. The credit for developing this style goes to Iswari Prasad Misra who himself belonged to a traditional Kathak family. After his death, his family members continued his work.
Still, this style is important to the traditional kaviditoda (poetic verses) intermingled with rhythmic patterns. This dance form follows oral and tabla for pure dances and prefers a moderate tempo and reveals the graceful movements in this tradition. Famed gurus of this style were Hanuman Prasad and Hari Prasad.
Kathak was also preserved in the royal courts by another ruler in Madhya named Pradesh by Raja Charander Singh. He wanted to bring the two different styles together. As all other styles of classical dance forms, two different styles of Kathak do not have rigid differences in the basic concept of Kathak. Kathak is considered as an outstanding classical dance form of India. It is proud to be a fusion of Indo-Moghal cultural trends. Especially, this particular dance form flourished under the Moghul Empire. Kathak is the only classical dance form of India closely linked with Muslim culture and Muslim traditions.With the passage of time, India came under British rule. Kathak dance was also called Natuch dance by the British rulers.
The credit of preserving the Lucknow Gharana of Kathak goes to Bindadin of Lucknow and his descendants. A Gharana is totally based on techniques. However, the main outstanding Gharana or schools (styles) of Kathak are Jaipur and Lucknow.
Dresses of Kathak are unique. The female dancers wear the sari or Lahenga and Choli or, sometimes the Angarakshak and (veil). The males often wear the kameez-churidar-vest - dhoti-kurta pyjama.

Uncertainly over GSP plus
Responding to a question about the expiration of the US Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) programme for Sri Lanka and other beneficiary countries on December 31, 2017, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that this has happened before as well and still they are not sure whether the congress had stopped it or there is a delay in the extension process.
Accordingly, the immediate effect of the GSP expiration is that the GSP eligible imports to the US from Sri Lanka and other GSP beneficiary countries and territories will be subject to non-preferential duties beginning January 1, 2018.
Minister Senaratne at the Cabinet press conference on Wednesday at the Department of Government Information, said that 68 percent of import is based on the European market and only 28 percent is based on the US market.
We do not get full relief, only GSP eligible imports will receive a relief. In February 2016, the US extended this relief until December 31, 2017. However, it was not extended afterwards and this has happened before as well, he said.
The minister further said that if they extend it later, they would repay the relief.
He said that Sri Lanka received GSP plus and that is given only to nine countries in the world.
When the Minister was asked whether Sri Lanka has an impact over its stance with regard to Jerusalem, he said that Sri Lanka never changed its stance regarding the status Jerusalem.
Member States in the United Nations General Assembly demanded that all countries comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the status of Jerusalem, following an earlier decision by the United States to recognise the Holy City as the capital of Israel, he said.
He said that even though parties changed in the past, Sri Lankas policy towards Jerusalem remained steadfast.

She has sown the seeds of change in many lives through her social service activities. Moved by the distress of the needy Concy Perera formed the Jeewa (Life) Foundation in 1985 under the slogan We Became a Life to You. Ever since its inception the foundation has been spearheading a number of social service activities ranging from blood donations, health clinics, donating organs, donating school equipment to children and donating dry rations for the poor for a continuous six years.
With the dawn of 2018 the foundation will commence its social service activities again with a blood donation, organ donation registration, health clinic, eyeglass donation, school equipment donation for school children and donating dry rations for the poor at the Sudharshi Hall, Colombo 7, on January 7 from 8.30 am to 3 pm. A biography of Jeewa Foundation founder Concy Perera titled Rajinak Nowu Rajinak penned by Dr Asela S Panditha too will be launched at the event.
The book traces her journey from organizing many relief operations on a small scale to powering large scale social service activities.
Jeewa Foundations theme song too will be launched at the event and musical instruments will be donated to commemorate the launch. Perera will also be felicitated with a doctorate from Russia on that day.
Perera has inherited this ability to feel others distress through her father F D Steven Perera. She says that though she was born to a family of eight, her home had been open to many poor children besides her brothers and sisters.
Thus she learnt to give and share at an early age. This habit soon snowballed into a larger scale as the years flew by.
Today Perera has helped build many lives from scratch, providing financial aid for small scale businesses to donating building equipment for houses. She had also helped many release their lands from debt, donated sewing machines, helped to construct tube wells, providing various forms of relief to Tsunami and flood victims.
I began by helping those close to me by donations dry rations and clothes. I soon realized that there are many others who feel the pain of the needy and wish to work to help the underprivileged.
It was necessary to establish the foundation to join hands with them and work towards a worthy cause in a broader scale, she explained.
She has also aided institutions belonging to all religions.
An annual event in her calendar is giving alms to 50 Buddhist monks at the temple of the tooth relic in Kandy. She has helped St Pauls Church, Moratuwa, obtain electricity. She had funded to build a Buddhist temple in Japan and a kovil in Dematogoda. She provides funds to build the pandal in Dematagoda every year. She also helps young girls to get ready for their big day by funding their bridal attire and by funding their bridal dressing.

Walking the talk
A landmark was created in the country's political history concerning the question of tackling corruption, with decisive action emanating from the Head of State that assuredly would see the slaying of the hydra headed monster of bribery, corruption, sleaze and intrigue in the upper echelons of political power, that has been eating into the country's vitals since the dawn of Independence. President Maithripala Sirisena, silencing critics, that the Bond Commission report too would go the same way of all other commissions, in the past- pigeon holed after presentation of the reports- revealed to the nation in a live television broadcast, the pith and substance of the Commission report. What is more, the President re-iterated his stand that he would act on the recommendations of the Commission and not only bring to book all those responsible who caused a massive loss of Rs 8.5 billion to the state but also take positive measures to recover the loot.
This is the first time that a government appointed Commission had not only found fault with the high and mighty in the same government but also recommended punitive action against a powerful government politician. Hitherto, Presidential Commissions only sought to whitewash governments and target the Opposition, as in the case of the Special Presidential Commission which recommended the deprivation of the civic right of former Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike.
In that respect the Yahapalanaya government should be commended for walking the talk and making a positive start, though belatedly, in redeeming the pledge made at the election to completely eradicate the scourge of corruption from the body politic. To the credit of President Sirisena, when he appointed the Commission, he took a huge political risk. This was a probe that did not figure in any Rajapaksas and the guns were trained on the functionaries of the Yahapalanaya government. He knew the fallout of the revelations could bring to naught all professions and pledges made at election, for clean governance. Still, he went ahead with appointing the Commission, and, what is more, has vowed to implement its recommendations.
Could this be the turning point in the country's political culture the people have been waiting for all these years that will see an end to the impunity with which state funds are embezzled by those wielding power It is too early to tell. The public, no doubt, will be waiting in anticipation to see the President's next move. He has promised to act in terms of the recommendations and bring to book those responsible. Not only that, in terms of the Commissions recommendations the President has also vowed to bring in special legislation to speed up legal action against the offenders. It appears that he means business and he is determined to close the chapter of corruption in local politics once and for all.
The Commission hearings also saw a refreshing departure from the government witnesses being treated with kid gloves by State Counsel. A powerful minister was subjected to a virtual inquisition and two other senior ministers made to answer summons of the Commission. What is more, for the first time ever, a Prime Minister took his place in the dock to answer questions put to him by the Commission.
This was in stark contrast to the time suspects arraigned for murder and rape having their cases withdrawn by the Attorney General's Department upon receiving telephone calls from powerful personages. Besides, all allegations made against the ruling family was brushed aside. No Presidential Commission was appointed to probe charges of mega corruption in the purchase of MIG jets or the colossal losses suffered by the national carrier.
The Commission report, no doubt, would have pleased the Rajapaksas, no end, hoping that this would be sufficient distraction from the public spotlight that was focused on their own doings, since the fall of the government. Mahinda Rajapaksa, understandably, was measured in his response and stated that he would make his views known when the report is presented to parliament. MR, perhaps, is concerned with another recommendation by the Commission, which was also revealed to the public by the President, for a full forensic audit on bond transactions, particularly, where EPF monies are concerned, from 2008, followed by action against the felons.
No doubt, a whole can of worms is going to be opened and the extent and magnitude of the losses revealed to the public. At the time the media was full of news of how captive funds were being splurged on the market by those holding responsible positions in the financial sector. One recalls how the Chairman of the Security and Exchanges Commission was forced to resign after he came out with certain revelations that were unpalatable to certain people at the very top. President Sirisena has already hinted at what is in store. In his address, on Wednesday, he said that he was not targeting any party, but, that, when all the scams unravel, members of the both main political parties are going to be exposed. This could only mean members of the Joint Opposition, who, after all, entered parliament from the SLFP/UPFA.

Writing to listen
The well known English folk story collector Henry Parker notes this point in his compilation of village folktales from Ceylon. Parker had been an avid listener to Sinhala folktales, while he was a colonial administrator, long before the advent of the radio listening came to be known in the local village set up. The contents of these features are interspersed by the brief discussions on the part of the invited and researched on each subject area that is covered. 
As a contributor to radio medium, I feel that the writing to radio has changed over the years. During the fifties and the sixties quite a number of books about writing as a career in broadcasting appeared both in English and in other languages all over the world. Perhaps this is reduced to the minimum as the interest in the subject area too has changed due to quite a number of reasons. During the fifties, as I remember we used to buy a weekly magazine titled as The Listener published by the World Service of the BBC. This periodical carried quite a number of articles that came to be broadcast over the World Service of the BBC in London.
Later as the same articles also came to be printed in the form of books, which had a good sale in all parts of the world where there was an English readership. This trend was followed in Sri Lanka at the formative period as local broadcasting system, when one of the learned Sinhala journals came to be known as Tarangani. This periodical contained quite a number of Sinhala articles that were broadcast in the Sinhala channels of the day. They included radio play scripts, poems, short stories, translations and original features.
[SUBHEAD] Feature scripts
A few books appeared carrying the radio play scripts. One was written by the veteran radio play producer P Welikala and the other by Professor Ediriweera Sarachchandra.
The trend extended up to the publication of Sugathapala de Silvas publication titled as Handa Naluva. This was in keeping with the well known English publication titled as Right way to Write Radio Plays by the BBC writer cum producer of the sixties, Val Henry Gielgud. I recollected all these as I read the pages of a latest collection of Sinhala feature scripts written and compiled by two lecturers of Mass Communication Department of Kelaniya University.
These two lecturers, Saman Rajapaksa and Amali Utpala Nandasiri, had taken the writing of radio features as a learning and teaching project via the classroom creative communication exercises. On reading the printed scripts, I felt that the materials drawn are predominantly from the local folklore sources as a guide to the teaching that embraces the areas of traditional patterns of communicating public opinion formation, and development communication. The two scholarly writers had taken pains in the writing training at the broadcast production with a team of undergraduate fitted to the purpose.
Thus the feature scripts envelope quite a number of layers in folklore, religion and the changing aspects of literature. Teaching the basis of sound perception at what it could do to the audience is the underlying premise of the intention. Then it is followed by the variety of the subject selected. Out of the 14 feature scripts printed, a major portion is developed to the origins of certain customs, maneuvering, use of language at the sensitive areas of rites and rituals. The collection is titled aptly as Iragala Vetena Yamaya (The phase when the sun sets) - perhaps taking a number of factors pertaining to the rural lifestyles. As recorded over the years, the folk stories have been passed down from the elders to the youngsters during the late evenings in specified places like the temple and tea kiosks.
The well known English folk story collector Henry Parker notes this point in his compilation of village folktales from Ceylon. Parker had been an avid listener to Sinhala folktales, while he was a colonial administrator, long before the advent of the radio listening came to be known in the local village set up. The contents of these features are interspersed by the brief discussions on the part of the invited and researched on each subject area that is covered.
Radio sound
As such, the discussion element is observed as an additional resource to the written script. This once again paves the way to the rediscovery of the use of radio sound broadcasting, a way of creative teaching.
Though not observed as a grave error on the part of broadcasting, it could be surmised that with the advent of the popularity of the FM channels, the writing for radio became obsolete and unwanted as there happened to be chatterboxes as against the more prepared radio broadcasters who discerned what should be transmitted. This ongoing debate is well answered by this publication. What deserves the attention of both practicing broadcaster as well as the discriminated audience
As media studies have now come to stay in the school curriculum, this publication could be gauged as a welcome variant to the available text prepared to help the student on the concept of writing to sound medium. Thus the effort on the part of the two lecturers in communication should be commended.
Frequent references
On writing these scripts, the two lecturers attempt to use a more colloquial and /or spoken dialect much suited to the ear than the eye.
There are frequent references to those who form the embedded material on the part of those who know rather than those who have bookish knowledge.
