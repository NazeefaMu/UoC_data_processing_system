Let go of it like Ajahn Brahm
Ajahn Brahm has become well known over the world as a household name for preaching the essence of the Buddhas teaching. He uses both a simplified expression as well as an anecdotal techniques to present some of the lesser known factors such as sathi, nibbida and dhyana. He is presumably responsible for popularizing the Buddhas complex teachings.
This British-born learned Thai monk presents episodes from his own experiences linking the orient and the occident paving the way for happy living and a path to lasting joy. The Buddha has stated that happiness is the most profitable ideal denoting the concept as santhutti paraman dhanam. Ajahn Brahm extends the phenomenon from various points of view. In the first instance, he denotes this in his collection of poular tales that came to be titled as Opening the Doors of your Heart.
Reading page by page and obtaining the material as creative communication exercise, I was expecting more material.
As a blissful blessing, I had the chance to read his latest contribution titled as The Art of Disappearing. This book which contains eleven short delightful chapters came as a welcome variant to other Dhamma publications that appear both in English and Sinhala. The material in the series of chapters is classified in the form of an array of mirrors which reflect our own inner conditions in daily experiences.
I had the chance to see my inner self via these reflections. This paved the way for a rediscovery of my self. What is significant and different is that Ajahn helps us know the way to learn better conditions of happiness as against the most boring and monotonous living conditions.
He transcends the narrow barriers of using the religious and spiritual factors in a manual or a handbook In the opening chapter, he stresses that the true purpose of practicing Buddhism is to let go of everything, not to get more things like attainments to show off to your friends.
The entire work encircles the concept of letting go of theme which ultimately makes one happier than he was earlier.
From this point onwards, he traces the various steps through which one could achieve the state of being happy by letting go off. The concept of letting off too is linked to the term disengagement.
Ajahn Brahm states that the nibbida means disengaging. The concept is well explained as follows.
You must sit there and you dont involve yourself in what you are experiencing. By not involving yourself in what you are experiencing, you stand back from life. It is almost like rejecting it the sort of rejection that makes things disappear.
Ajahn reiterates: When you understand the suffering in the world, you see the world as a load of rubbish. Because it is rubbish, you disengage. The teaching of disengagement of the ultimate teaching of letting off.
Ajahn makes the reader take up to meditation process not as a tedious mental exercise, but as a way of perceiving ones own innerness. As such, he underlines that happiness comes from disappearing.
He takes into account two main suttas of the Buddha: Dhammachakkappavattana Sutta and Samma Ditthi Sutta. The book could be read and understood from any page you wish.
Perhaps this is one of the best Dhamma gifts given to the world. Clinging on to the worldly issues make us suffer. If I disappear the suffering is over.
To see that I disappear it is the disappearance of ill will, hatred and violence. As Ajahn underlines: When you are demanding you are there. When you have ill will, you are there. When you have craving, you are there.
All these things create a sense of self that thinks it owns things and gets involved. So you are the problem.
The disappearance from I and you makes you happy.

Pohela Boishakh Celebrated in Colombo
The Bengali New Year 1423 (first day of Bengali month of Boishakh: Pohela Boishakh) was celebrated with great enthusiasm and festivity in Colombo on April 14. The event was organized at the Chancery premises of the Bangladesh High Commission with the participation of the members of expatriate Bangladesh community and officials and family members of the High Commission in colourful dresses of Punjabi and Saree.
The highlight of the programme was a cultural soiree in the evening that included solo and chorus songs, recitation of poems, fashion show of traditional and contemporary attires of Bangladesh. High Commissioner Tarik Ahsan, in his welcome speech, wished everyone happy Bengali New Year and mentioned that intensity of heat and storms seen in the month of Boishakh symbolizes the energy for creating the new out of the old. He remarked that this is the right occasion for Bengalis to take the New Year resolution for building a better life in the new year.
The cultural event was followed by an impressive array of authentic and traditional Bangladeshi food items, prepared mainly by the family members of the High Commission. The food was served in an ambience of Bengali music and decoration with traditional crafts of Bangladesh. Around 70 people took part in the celebration.

Dazzling spectrum of a medic
What is unique between these two, is not the brush that is used but a simple ball point pen. The painter in this situation is a soul-searching doctor who is able to evaluate his artistic inherence as well as his healing powers.
Dr. Kamal Perera's technique is characterized by flat areas of colour with his chosen subjects in simple but defiant outlines. The paintings are highly complexed and combine various artistic styles to create reality and artifice. This remains his central signature that is recognized by the experts or critics. In such art, one cannot identity any school of cubism, contemporary, modern as found in the last century on emerging artists who are struggling to achieve their own identity and many like Dr. Perera, venture into new form of lines and colour, leaving behind the brush and palette which is a difficult technique they put on paper with amazing results.
Dr. Kamal A. Perera
At the Lionel Wendt Gallery last week was the fourth Solo Exhibition called SPECTRUM of Dr. Kamal Perera where more than 30 exhibits of ball point art among them in acrylic, pencil work, and another in oils were on view.
This inspirational doctor chose to modernize traditional themes with direct reference to devices found in constructed still life for example, the portrait of Abe. Lincoln. One of the outstanding features I found was that he under-scored the background in order to project man, woman or animal thereby push the background into oblivion without any clashes of one underscoring the other or overlapping each other.
His aesthetic leanings can be traced in most of the paintings as they stretch across many faces of joy, solitude, exuberance, pathos etc. probably arising from the doctor's mood at the time his ballpoint scribble the surface. Generally, artists are sensitive people and passionate about their art that makes them incorporate music and poetry into visions, some of which I found in his paintings, He may have subverted precision of his earlier work which I had not seen but can find a certain amount of clarity in a couple of paintings, He is a figurative painter and there is plenty for testimony though the paintings are far and in between. He must spread out his dreams more spaciously and not cram up; there by find more volume that will add distinction and gravity. I found a great amount of subtle colour streaming out of his pen and they were splendid merging one to another in spirited scope.
To obtain this effect, Dr. Perera has to be a very clever artist and an astute one. He is ardent about his subject matter and pay homage to women not baring their assets as our culture deem so. Freedom of the wild was limited for want of fauna and flora was. (many be I am a nature person) and found the lapse. The brilliant and bold colours used on the SRI LANKAN JUNGLE FOWL (2) was a miracle produced from the simple pen where many an artist with a palette and brush have failed. So was THE ELEPHANT (14).
Throughout his paintings different forms and sources of light suggests the presence of his object to produce linear mode that has become increasingly his signature form. For a medic unlike a normal artist, can hassle because he has been trained to look at human form differently and objectively . Fortunately, there were not very many human forms and never prevented depth or sculptural interpretation. The design and saturated field of colour are a response to his surroundings, apparently. Lastly, I found his continuing fascination and individualism can reveal his innermost love for art.

## Title: The birth of an auteur

The birth of an auteur
Theres something in film aesthetics called the Auteur Theory. The idea is simple: a painter paints, a musician composes, and a director directs. By that logic, the director is king, and a films merits are to be assessed from the notion that he or she is its author. The concept was introduced in France and found its way to the United States somewhere in the 1950s. Given the American cinemas reliance on the studio system, however, those who contended that a film by Director A belongs to (and was purely authored by) Director A were in the minority.
Not surprisingly the theory got outdated, though it remains significant even today. It explores the relationship between the film and the director, and assumes, somewhat clumsily (one can say), that the greater the number of intermediaries between the two is  that is, in terms of technicians, scriptwriters, dialogues writers, and cameramen  the lesser the chances are of the director being able to impose his or her vision on the final product.
In Sri Lanka this theory wasnt really popular, if at all because filmmaking here turned out to be a collaborative art most of the time. There were very few directors who were able to impose their vision so much on their films that we could point at them and recognise in them individual marks of the director in question.
Undervalued
The usual exceptions to this come to my mind as I write this  including, without any doubt, Lester James Peries. But the star of this week, who has been undervalued by his own countrymen, is probably the most fitting example we have for the idea that, at the end of the day, the director can and does have a final say in the shaping of his product.
Vasantha Obeyesekere, the subject of this article, remained, until his last film Aganthukayo, an ambitious director. There are sequences in his films which are edited in a deliberately jarring way, intended perhaps to provide shock-value legitimately. The best example which crops to ones mind is that iconic final sequence in Dadayama, where Swarna Mallawarachchi attempts to shield herself from her assailant, whos about to run his car over her, but the fact of the matter is that even in his lesser films, such sequences are easy to spot out, though hard to interpret.
Critics for the most imply that Obeyesekere was a twilight director, who tapped into both the commercial, mainstream potential and serious potential of the cinema. This is true. This was not very evident in his first few films, but it came out powerfully in two successive films  Diyamanthi, which was essentially a romantic thriller that has faint echoes of Alfred Hitchcock, and Palagetiyo, which brought out what would become his main preoccupation and motif for the rest of his career: the clash between fantasy and reality, often approximating to the conflict between the genders and the realities of class distinctions.
In his later films  Dadayama, Kadapathaka Chaya, and Maruthaya  he was unapologetic in how he handled his subject-matter, which explains the intense rawness of some of their sequences. Swarna Mallawarachchis performance as Rathmalie in Dadayama is powerful not merely because she is sexually exploited by Priyankara Jayanath (Ravindra Randeniya), but because she desperately hopes and resolves for a happy ending that never comes.
Idealism
After being repeatedly abused, she turns into a cynic, and even when shes married to him, her former idealism is gone: so much so that, when Jayanath sardonically reveals to her how she was deceived, she tears and claws at his face, blurting out that she isnt in the least surprised. The Rathmalie of the first half of Dadayama is an incurable romantic, while the Rathmalie of the second half is as brutal and vengeful as her tormentor.
Dadayama is not the only film by Obeyesekere and it certainly isnt his most mature: as the writers of Profiling Sri Lankan cinema imply, that credit should go to Kadapathaka Chaya (which I cant really comment on, since I havent watched it in a while). There too, the woman is the ideal romantic who turns out to be cynical, but to her credit Swarna Mallawarachchi (who played the main character in there too) transforms her character into more than just a rebel.
Theres a sequence in Kadapathaka Chaya that I revisit again and again, and which proves this point. That sequence, of her killing her tormentor (played by Vijaya Kumaratunga), is a virtual master-class in editing, not just for how he aligns her act of throwing acid on his face with his desperate attempts at saving himself (to no avail, since hes bedridden, cant move, and is alone in his room with her) but also for how he meticulously orders his scenes in such a way that we see Mallawarachchis emotions and feelings as she prepares for her act of vengeance (underscored by drumbeats from a thovil ceremony, obviously to bring out the ritualistic nuances of the whole sequence). She is, at first, hesitant, but she looks at herself in the mirror (which shows a scarred face, symbolic again) and resolves to complete her act.
To watch these sequences today is to appreciate a director who was daring enough to depict such a scene (for the mainstream Sinhala cinema, with its mildly patriarchal outlook, couldnt have conceived a woman reacting against a man this way) and an actress capable of expressing a wide range of emotion in them (which is partly why Obeyesekeres two best films remain this and Dadayama).
Symbolical
Sometimes though, that meticulous, intense, unapologetic, and zealous handling of subject-matter (all these adjectives fit Obeyesekeres attitude to the cinema, please note), as shown in these scenes, could overreach itself. It happened in Maruthaya, which gets its story  of the wife and two daughters of a once powerful politician, whose death precipitates their economic and social downfall  across so theatrically (as with the sequences of the three women alone in a darkly lit room, surrounded by former friends and fiancs who symbolically look at and then abandon them) that by the end of it all, metaphor and ideology tend to collide so much and overstuff the entire film with symbols. The use of penetrating, raw dialogues, which figure in as a strength in Obeyesekeres other films, is hardly enough to save this from its self-perpetuating, self-brooding vision.
All this goes to show that a directors strength can, if overworked, be his weakness, but it doesnt diminish Obeyesekeres stature as our foremost film auteur. He scripted his own films and shaped the dialogues in them. He explored womens issues in a characteristic way: theres a thread that joins Dhammi Fonseka (Palagetiyo), Swarna Mallawarachchi, and Sangeetha Weeraratne, and that is how he evoked empathy for their characters in his scripts. This doesnt mean that he depicted them as flawless: on the contrary, they are pleasure-seekers, and in their attempts at realising their romantic dreams of marriage life, they tragically fall back. To me this is best epitomised in Dorakada Marawa and Salelu Warama, both of which had Sangeetha Weeraratne and both of which were based on real incidents (particularly the latter, which was directly influenced by a real-life murder of a University undergraduate by her lover).
Vision
What Ive written so far hardly goes by way of summing up the man and his conception of the cinema entirely. Suffice it to say, then, that Vasantha Obeyesekere (who was recognised with a Lifetime Achievement Award by Derana earlier this year) went beyond many of his contemporaries to prove that the cinema, while collaborative at the outset, could be used to assert a directors personal vision.
This isnt to say that his contemporaries failed in that respect. Its just that Obeyesekere, with those 10 films he made, proved that once a filmmaker had a substantial role to play in the shaping of his stories, he could make his work accessible to his audience through those little, little details and motifs that make them up and figure in each and every plot-line he scripted and filmed.
And at the end of the day, Obeyesekere remains virtually unsurpassed on this count. He has and he had few peers in this respect. Small wonder, we can say.

Mothers Monologue
I am so happy that you, my most consummate of beings living on my body have set aside a day to think of me. International Mother Earth Day. You have also given a day to think of your darling mothers. Remember, they are for all time. One cannot measure a mother's love or speak of her sacrifices by a twenty four hour yardstick just for one day.
My sweet humans, as Mother Earth my love is beyond borders, nationality, creed and colour.
Fauna and flora on my body vary. But they are all the same to me. They make me to be a joyous and living mother.
Please, my children spare a few moments of your time and give ear to me on this beautiful day. I am the mother of both the living and the non living. My body stretches from the summit of Mount Everest to the dark and deep abyss in the Pacific Ocean. On my body are the oceans and land. Mothers are compared to magnets. Mothers attract children, children are attracted to mothers. Magnets attract many metals. As for me, I attract all things  be they terrestrial or celestial, onto my body. My body becomes the final resting place for all things animate and inanimate.
The noble teachers of our world had loving mothers. They have all left their sweet footprints on me, while treading on me, cuddling their sons. Their sons must have clung on to them. Beautiful. I have also been honoured to have been able to kiss the feet of these matters who walked on me preaching their immortal doctrines on compassion, righteousness, forgiveness, love, peace and humility. Yes! I think that I am the most blessed of all mothers.
Within me is water-life giving fresh water, oceans that give sentience and mobility for your journeys to other lands, rivers, water falls, glaciers, valleys, reefs, exquisite flowers, birds, fauna.
Above all you. Beneath my body is untold wealth  oil, gold precious stones and many ores for you to harness and share for the benefit of all, mankind.
I was overjoyed my darlings in seeing you, spread over my body. I thought that you were going to make a golden chain of love encircling me, together with the fauna and flora living on my body. I wanted to hear the patter of the feet of little humans, and all others on my body, the chirping of birds and the flight of butterflies and bees.
Alas! My darling humans, what have you given me You have desecrated my humble body with the pock marks from the shells of missiles and rockets. Also toxic waste, land mines, ammunition dumps, military bunkers and blood soaked dungeons. All this to destroy your own kind, and sadly the innocent animals and plants suffer because of these cruelties. All these have caused my body to shudder and give ......... tsunamis, earthquakes, earthquakes and volcanoes. You have desecrated me by wantonly destroying my natural shape and vegetation. Result is global warming and the drying up of my sources of beautiful water.
Your wars have soaked my body with the blood and tears of gallant young sons and daughters. You commemorate their death by once again firing guns and observing two minutes silence.
You rejoice when yo see the young ones of your opponents die. How many tears have I shed in seeing mothers walking, walking, walking on me, with babes in their arms crying of hunger. At times, these little ones fall off their tired and feeble grasps of their mothers, only to be unintentionally trampled by those followings.
They walk into unknown lands as refugees. It reminds me of two events. The flight into Egypt of Jesus Christ and the Hejire of Mohammed Nabi memories. One hallowed teacher reached His ultimate vision and enlightenment seated on me. The blood of another soaked my body with His blood at the foot of the cross on which he was crucified.
My children, I shudder as a mother when I think of the million of babes, whose cut up pieces are sucked out of their mothers womb and dumped into pails. These pieces and, at times tiny humans about to come into our world are buried inside me. They rollicked happily in their mothers water bag, only to be scattered on my body. Only my small innocent my name bearing, gentle earth warm will bear witness to these tragedies.
You, my beautiful children have set aside a day to think of me. Me, a once happy mother, saddened by the deeds of my lovely humans.
Only you have the ability to know what is right and wrong. Please make this day to think of all those who live on me.
Yes! You speak so much about me. Honouring the motherland, dying for the motherland. Humans call their country of their birth, their motherland. National Anthums mention my name.
Please think of my role in your lives. I am just an abode for you. Please, only you, my darling humans can make me happy.
The only way to make me happy is to abide by the beautiful teachings of your Celestial Matters and, do nob do to others, what you do not wish to be done to yourself, love your neighbour as yourself and wish that peace with all those who are living on me to senile think, with lots of laughter and amity and show me by example that you are my most precious gems.

Live-Action Adaptations You Didnt Know Were Coming
As both the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Star Wars continue to create multi-release, multi-property meta-franchises for The Walt Disney Company to annually mine for box office dominance, the studio has decided that it needs a third cinematic pillar to set its entire filmmaking apparatus on: live-action adaptations of its many beloved animated classics.
Disney may just have opened Pandoras Box in this regard, reaching into its legendary vault and dredging up some particularly esoteric  or, perhaps, outright questionable  properties. As we started to take stock of it all, even we here at Screen Rant couldnt believe whats being prepped, which led us to compiling this list of 10 Live-Action Disney Adaptations You Didnt Know Were Coming.
Yes, these are all real  for better or worse.
TINK:
One of Disneys biggest no-brainer adaptations is also, interestingly, one of the biggest unknowns at the moment. Heres what we do know. After being introduced to movie audiences all over the world in the 1953 animated classic Peter Pan, Tinker Bell has essentially gone on to become Disneys unofficial mascot, taking a prominent position in its multimedia advertising and in its bevy of theme parks around the world. Oh, yeah  theres also her slew of highly successful direct-to-video animated films, which started in 2008 and continue on to this day, and, now, the live-action big-screen adaptation, which will star (and be produced by) Reese Witherspoon.
But unlike most of the other entries in Disneys burgeoning adaptation pile, Tink will also serve as part prequel as well as remake, presumably telling the story of how Tinker Bell would eventually meet up with Peter Pan, Wendy and the rest of the Lost Boys. (The film could also draw upon the original source material, J.M. Barries 1904 play and 1911 novel versions of Peter Pan, though something tells us Disney will skew more closely to its Disney Fairies franchising initiative.)
PRINCE CHARMING:
After having successfully mined the various Disney Princesses into a multi-million dollar empire all of its own, the company is apparently now ready to do the same for the boys. Prince Charming was a spec script (that is to say, a screenplay written on the speculation that someone, somewhere will eventually buy it once its done) written by Matt Fogel (Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son) that looks to the titular princes brother, a man who has been unable to live up to the family name, thanks to a distinct lack of manners and, well, charm. Disney purchased it last year and is in the process of turning it into a full-blown production to complement the rest of its ever-expanding live-action wares.
Much like Tink, nothing is known in the way of director or stars, but given the recent success that was last springs Cinderella, we fully expect this project to be given a great deal of resources and a giant publicity blitz; this could very well be the birth of the next great Disney franchise, extending for countless sequels and meet-n-greet opportunities in the theme parks.
GENIES:
Disney has, in its 1992 animated film Aladdin, one of its most critically acclaimed characters: Robin Williamss Genie. The company also suddenly has an insatiable appetite for revisiting its older animated properties, and when these two facts collide, Genies is the result.
This new film will serve as a prequel to the original cartoon, showing how the various Genies ended up being imprisoned in various magic lamps. Yes, thats right  the company has yet to announce whether the protagonist in this spinoff will be the same as the late Williamss legendary character, but the odds are better than good (after all, theres always James Iglehart, the Broadway adaptations award-winning performer, to fill Williamss shoes). This is especially true when considering the fact that Disney is already angling this to be a lead-in to the new live-action adaptation of Aladdin, which is expected to drop within the next few years. Genies is being written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, whose previous credits include  bizarrely  Freddy vs. Jason, the Friday the 13th remake and the upcoming Baywatch movie reboot.
PINOCCHIO:
This is where we take a turn from live-action spinoffs, whether prequels or not, and start to enter the traditional territory of remakes. Pinocchio, released in 1940 and inspired by the 1883 childrens book The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi, was only Walt Disneys second feature, and while it wasnt considered a financial success at the time, it has since gone on to become one of the touchstones of not only the multi-national conglomerate, but also of the American cultural consciousness.
The updated adaptation  which, no, also doesnt yet boast a release date  will be scripted by Peter Hedges, who wrote Whats Eating Gilbert Grape and About a Boy, and is said to be loosely based on the classic animated film. (Were going to go out on a limb here and predict that the sequence where Pinocchio gets drunk and smokes cigars with all the other little boys will be on the chopping block.)
CRUELLA:
Because Maleficent was so successful for The Walt Disney Company  and because the studio already has so many other similar projects in its production pipeline  the next villain to get the spinoff/prequel treatment is none other than Cruella de Vil, the antagonist from 1961s 101 Dalmatians.
Emma Stone is currently in talks to portray the younger, perhaps-less-evil Cruella, and she already has some big-screen competition: Glenn Close played the character in the live-action renditions of the cartoon, 101 Dalmatians and 102 Dalmatians, which were released in 1996 and 2000, respectively (and whose existence could possibly explain why the Mouse House has no interest in adding a new live-action version of the original movie to its current docket  though, if all these other films are successful, one better believe itll only be a matter of time before a remake of the remakes gets added to the list). Kelly Marcel, the screenwriter behind the Fifty Shades of Grey film, is handling writing duties.
DUMBO:
This is easily one of the more surreal entries on this list.
First, theres the involvement of ethereal director Tim Burton, who has already helped to make an earlier Disney live-action adaptation a huge success  Alice in Wonderland, which grossed $1 billion six years ago  but whose strongly idiosyncratic style tends to dominate whatever property hes attached to, including, even, Batman. Then theres the writer side of the filmmaking talent: Ehren Kruger, who is best known for being Transformerss franchise writer  a not-entirely comforting credit on his resume.
Lastly, theres the little fact that the original Dumbo from 1941 is only 64 minutes long, so brand-new material needs to be inserted to bump it up to a now-standard 90-minute run time. Were already hearing that itll include a unique family story that will parallel Dumbos own journey from orphaned circus elephant to flying wonder. Odd.
Screen Rant
WINNIE THE POOH:
Winnie the Pooh has been one of Disneys most celebrated properties since it was first licensed in 1961 (leading to four theatrical films and countless television segments), and the studio is clearly hoping that that magic will jump the divide from animation to live action.
Alex Ross Perry, the writer and director behind the dark comedy Listen Up, Philip, has been hired to script the big-screen reboot, and Perry has said that his take on the story will  very much in the vein of Hook  focus on an adult Christopher Robin having to return to the Hundred Acre Wood and reconnect with all his stuffed-animal pals. And while theres certainly the possibility of the writer turning to A.A. Milnes original novels (Winnie-the-Pooh [1926] and The House at Pooh Corner [1928]) for more inspiration, hes already stated that hes been greatly inspired by more recent fare, such as the relationship between the protagonist and his android teddy bear in Steven Speilbergs A.I.

Bots, explained
While the technology to simulate conversation with a computer has been around for decades, bots  orchatbots  are an increasingly trendy model forsoftware.
This new obsession came on fast. But why Where did these botscome from Who is building them What forIs a fake conversation betterthan just clicking buttons Youll be hearing a lot more about bots soon,so heres an overview.
What is a bot
A bot issoftware that is designed to automate the kinds of tasks you would usually do on your own, like making a dinner reservation, adding an appointment to your calendar or fetching and displaying information. The increasingly common form of bots, chatbots, simulate conversation. They often live inside messaging apps  or are at least designed to look that way  and it should feel like youre chatting back and forth asyou would with a human.
What do bots do
Some bots areused to handle a variety of customer service requests, which would normally require a telephone call to a human agent. One example: Taco Bell has released a bot that allows you toorder and pay for tacos through an automated chat conversation.
Other bots like X.ai can help schedule your meetings for you. Simply add the bot to your email thread, and it will take over back-and-forth conversation needed to schedule a meeting, alert you once its been arranged and add itto your calendar. As bottechnology improves, the thinking is that bots will be able to automate all kinds of things; perhaps even something as complex as your taxes.
Where do bots live
Chatbots already exist in many of the places where you communicate, primarily messaging apps, which lend themselves to a conversational interface. There are bots in Slack, the business-focused messaging service, many of which aim to help with work-related tasks like expenses or to-do lists.
Kik Messenger, which has 275 million registered users, recently announced a bot store. Thisincludes onebot to send people Vine videos and another for getting makeup suggestions from Sephora. Twitter has had bots for years, like this bot that tweets about earthquakes as soon as theyre registered or a Dominos bot that allows you to order a pizza by tweeting a pizza emoji. Manyexpect Facebook to roll out a bot store of some kind at its annual F8 conference for software developers this week, which means these bots may soon operate inside Messenger, its messaging app. It has already started testing a virtual assistant bot called M, but the product is only available for a few people and still primarily powered by humans.
Who is building these bots
Many of the same companies thatare building the apps that you use on your phones are building bots. A bunch of big companies are betting big on bots, including Microsoft and Slack, which has easy access for bots.
Google, the company with perhaps the greatest artificial intelligence chops and the biggest collection of data about you  both of which power effective bots  has been behind here. But it isalmost certainly plotting ways to catch up. Google Now, its personal assistant system built within Android, serves many functions of the new wave of bots, but has had hiccups.The company is reportedly working on a chatbot that will live in a mobile messaging product and is experimenting with ways to integrate Now deeper with search.
Where did the idea for bots come from
Bots have been around for more than 50 years. With the recent global boom in mobile messaging apps, such as WeChat, Facebook Messenger and Slack, theyre seen as increasingly relevant. Theyve likely been right under your nose. The first bots on Twitter starting rolling out in 2006.
Why are we hearing so much about themnow
One key reason: The technology that powers bots, artificial intelligence software, is improving dramatically, thanks to heightened interest from key Silicon Valley powers like Facebook and Google. That AI enables computers to process language  and actually converse with humans  in ways they never could before.
It came about from unprecedented advancements in software (Googles Go-beating program, for example) and hardware capabilities.
Another reason is thatFacebook, which has 900 million Messenger users, is expected to get into bots. Many see this as a big potential opportunity; where Facebook goes, the rest of the industry often follows. Slack, which lends itself to bot-based services, has also grown dramatically to twomillion daily users, which bot makers and investors see as a potentially lucrative market.
It helps that messaging is seen as a fresh opportunity, especially for interacting with a corporationin the same personal space youd normally interact with a friend.
The chat space is sort of the last unpolluted space [on your phone], saidSam Mandel, who works at the startup studio Betaworks and is also building a weather bot for Slack called Poncho. Its like the National Park of peoples online experience. Right now, the way people use chat services, its really a good private space that you control. (That, of course, could quickly go sour if early implementations are too spammy or useless.)
You might also argue that the increasing use of consumer technology has made people impatient, especially when it comes to customer service. Social media helped streamline those conversations, and nowbots can automate them.
Will bots replace apps Are they better
Part of the current obsession with bots is driven bya perceivedfatigue with apps  so developers and companiesare lookingto bots as a new path to reach consumers.
But bots wont kill apps anytime soon. Its more likely theycould replaceparts ofsome apps, especially where theres some sort of complex transaction involved or customer service. The downside of bots is that theyre often one-dimensional.
Ive seen a lot of hyperbole around bots as the new apps, but I dont know if I believe that, saidPrashant Sridharan, Twitters global director of developer relations. I dont think were going to see this mass exodus of people stopping building apps and going to build bots. I think theyre going to build bots in addition to the app that they have or the service they provide.
While AI advancements have propelled bots, industry insiders caution that the AI is not quite yet capablefor really polished chat bots. Computerscan cull up baseball stats orrecommend a restaurant, but they still cantmaintain a complex conversation (which is whyFacebooks M is still powered by humans).
To be honest, Im a little worried about the bot hype overtaking the bot reality, said M.G. Siegler, a partner with GV, the investment firm formerly known as Google Ventures. Yes, the high level promise of what bots can offer is great.
But this isnt going to happen overnight. And its going to take a lot of experimentation and likely bot failure before we get there.

Eshan Pieris does Sri Lanka proud
Former Thomian, young Eshan Pieris won second place in the Rotax Max Challenge Asia - Round 2 held at the Elite Plus Speedway Circuit, Malaysia on recently. This came on the heels of another excellent performance, earlier in March, when he was a podium finisher, placing 5th in the Senior Category at Round 1 of X30 Challenge Singapore 2016. This is Singapores biggest internationally sanctioned race.
Driving for RL Karting Team Malaysia, Eshan in a new BirelArt showed his pace with a second in the Time Trials and a third in Heat 1.
In Heat 2, Eshan's engine shut down in the warm-up lap which resulted in an 11th starting position for the pre-finals but he fought back to take a decisive third place, giving him a good place to start the finals where he went on to finish second. He also recorded the fastest lap in both pre-final and finals.
Richaryd Rabot, Head of Operations at the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit Bandaragama (SLKC), who watched Eshans epic performance said, Eshan drove brilliantly against a field of extremely experienced champions from around Asia.
He was hot on the wheels of the ultimate winner, Senna Sulaiman Noor who was a mere 0.133 seconds ahead, while Weiron Tan, who came in third, trailed Eshan by 3.847 seconds.
Most F1 drivers have started off as Go-kart Champions, including Michael Schumacher, Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button. Schumacher was just six when he won his first karting championship. Hamilton began karting at the age of eight and quickly began winning races and Cadet class championships.
Button also started karting at eight, and at nine, came first in the British Super Prix and went on to win all 34 races of the 1991 British Cadet Kart Championship. The rest, as they say, is history.
Richayrd added that it is essential that talent is identified and training starts at a young age if they are to make an impact in the motor sports arena. This is why we have brought down Cadet Karts which are designed for children between the ages of seven to about eleven or twelve.
We are even more fortunate to have had Eshan conduct the training for these young drivers as he is able to share his expertise to inspire and give these future champions the best start for success.
He went on to explain that the current 800-meter racing track at SLKC, the largest in the country, is being expanded further to over 1,100 meters which will allow Sri Lanka to host regional and internationally accredited races. Discussions are already underway to conduct one leg of the X30 Championship here.
In addition to putting Sri Lanka on the motor sporting and Go-karting map, attracting many visitors from the region who are passionate about the sport, this will help expose the islands young drivers to the best competition and take Go-karting and motor sports in Sri Lanka to a different league.

Corruption: over 180 complaints
The Voice Against Corruption Organisation yesterday requested a Central Bank and Inland Revenue Department to intervene the implementation of the law with regard to moneys illegally repatriated abroad as disclosed by the Panama papers and US-based Global Financial Integrity organisation.
Convener of Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe addressing a media briefing yesterday said the Panama Papers exposure may help divulge important information regarding local politicians and their friends and relatives whose accounts were circulated through several banks in other countries.
"Special investigation should be conducted to take legal action against Sri Lankans who figure in the Panama papers'', he said.
He said that the Maithripala-Ranil government has failed the people, just like the previous government.
"At the time of the election, President Sirisena made many promises to the people, but today he is silent. When this government came into power they promised to investigate and bring those guilty to book. However, what is now happening is that President Sirisena is looking the other way and minding his own business and Ranil Wickremesinghe is also doing the same," he said.
"It is very evident that this government too is protecting the fraudsters and culprits and has only cheated the people in order to come into power.
We have also discovered that this government is protecting the deal makers and now they are also in the government.
The UNP is also now working towards releasing political figures by sacrificing some lower ranking officers in order to hoodwink the people," he said.
"We ask that President Sirisena keep his promise to the people and punish the wrong doers. If not this government cannot go forward. In order to protect the party, thePresident has even added wrong doers to his
party. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe too add people those who are responsible for the bribery and corruption to the government," he said.
"We have already lodged 180 detailed complaints to the FCID, CID and the Anti-Corruption Secretariat with regard to the large corruption and malpractices of the previous government. But the actions are pending. If they are not going to enforce the law of the country and take action, they there is no doubt that this government too is acting against the law. We will not let off and we will continue to fight to expose the wrong doers of this country and push for justice," he said.
"This government also engaged in nepotism like the previous government," he also alleged. "One example is the payment of Rs. 700,000 as rent for the official residence of SLT and Mobitel Chairman who is the brother of President. His own allowance has also been raised from Rs.500, 000 to Rs.1million. A sonin-law of one of the powerful ruling party politicians has an Advertising Agency which handles all government related advertisement jobs. There have been many corrupt deals at the Lanka Transforms Limited which are not second to the transactions done by the Avant-Garde. Most of the people at the Lanka Transforms Limited are past employees of the CEB. People who have benefited from this are blocking the COPE investigations now. We have a doubt whether FCID is also have a connection to this as the FCID officials are dragging the investigations for long time," he said.

Gammanpila objects to Ranawakas place in Constitutional Council
Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila strongly objects to Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka not being removed from the Constitutional Council, despite having four ongoing police investigations.
Not just us, even the Joint Opposition requested the President to remove Ranawaka from the Constitutional Council. Now we doubt if the investigations of Sandeep Sampath Gunawardena, the victim of the hit-and-run accident allegedly committed by Minister Ranawaka, will be carried out unbiased by the Police Department. We are wondering if the present IGP owes Ranawaka anything in return for his appointment, he said.
For once, the fate of Jayasundera was in Ranawakas hands. Now the fate of Ranawaka is in the hands of Jayasundera, he said.
Gammanpila said that by including suspects in the Constitution Council the government and has shaken the faith placed in them by the public:
This shatters the hopes of the public who voted for the present government to come into power, he said.

Back-to-back  Laureus Awards for Djokovic

BERLIN, Monday: Serena Williams is celebrating another highlight in her amazing career after winning a record-equalling fourth Laureus World Sports Award. And on a great night for tennis, Novak Djokovic was honoured with the Laureus World Sportsman Award for the second straight year and for the third time in his career.
Serena, the worlds top womens tennis player, was named Laureus World Sportswoman of the Year again, after a sparkling 2015 in which she won three Grand Slams.
Laureus Academy Member Boris Becker, now Djokovics coach, said: He had a great year again. Hes played 88 matches, has won 82, He won three out of the four Grand Slams, reached the final of the French Open, hes won seven other tournaments. Very few players, if any, had a year like that.
There was a special posthumous Laureus Spirit of Sport Award to celebrate the life of Johan Cruyff, who died in March. It was received by his son Jordi Cruyff.
On a glittering evening in Berlin that recognised the outstanding sporting achievements of 2015, rugby was the other big winner with the All Blacks taking the Laureus Team Award and Dan Carter receiving the Laureus Comeback of the Year Award, following the teams Rugby World Cup success.
Carter said: Its nice to be recognised for the year I had in 2015. It was a very special year, not only for me, but also for the All Blacks and to be a part of that was amazing.
To the delight of the Berlin audience, Germanys Jan Frodeno, the first man to win both the Ironman World Championship and an Olympic triathlon gold medal, was presented with the Laureus Action Sports Award, while golfer Jordan Spieth won the Laureus Breakthrough of the Year Award. Spieth said: Thank you so much to the Laureus Academy. Just to know a couple of you is an honour. For me its unique. Were used to being recognised in the golfing community but this Award recognises us around the world to all of sport and its something thats very difficult to put into words. Brazilian Paralympic swimmer Daniel Dias won his third Laureus Disability Award, another record. Dias, who is one of Brazils big hopes for gold medals the Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in September, said: This is another great honour for me and gives me great encouragement, as we are now in the build-up to the Paralympic Games in Rio. To think I have won win three Laureus Awards, something only managed by other sportsmen like Roger Federer, Usain Bolt and Kelly Slater, is quite overwhelming.
Three-time Formula One world champion Niki Lauda, now Non-Executive Chairman of the Mercedes AMG Petronas team, received the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award.

Bairstow revives memories of Stokes stand with double century

LONDON, Tuesday - Jonathan Bairstow was involved in another large stand with a big-hitting partner as he revived memories of his finest day in an England shirt.
Four months ago Bairstow and Ben Stokes, who struck a stunning double century, shared a record-breaking stand of 399 against South Africa in Cape Town -- a partnership that included the Yorkshiremans maiden Test hundred.
Monday saw Bairstow in the runs again, this time for defending county champions Yorkshire, with the wicketkeeper-batsman posting a career-best 246 and sharing a partnership of 227 with Liam Plunkett, who made 126, as Hampshire were run ragged on the second day of a First Division fixture at Headingley.
Asked if there was a similarity in the two stands, both of which featured him batting alongside a big-hitting partner, Bairstow said: Exactly. Both Bairstow and umpire Nigel Llong had to take evasive action when one of Plunketts 18 boundaries came whistling straight down the pitch.
I think he nearly cleaned me up at the other end, said the wicketkeeper-batsman.
I didnt really see too much of the ball, and I think Nigel Llong was running the other way as well, said Bairstow, whose innings was the centrepiece of Yorkshires imposing total of 593 for nine declared.
Plunkett may be better known as a fast bowler but the England internationals hitting power with the bat is no secret -- its just that he rarely wielded the willow to such good effect. The way Liam came out and played was absolutely fantastic, said Bairstow. You saw from ball one how cleanly he came out and struck it.
When someones striking it like that, you just let them go as long as possible.
Hampshire captain James Vince then did his chances of an England Test call-up no harm with an impressive 76 not out against one of the best county attacks around as the visitors reached stumps on 141 for five.
Elsewhere, Australia-born Sam Robson pressed his cased for a Test recall with a career-best 231 on a day when Middlesex and England colleague Steven Finn marked his return to action with a wicket first ball against Warwickshire at Lords.
Robson, 175 not out overnight, went to his double century in 311 deliveries before Middlesex were all out for 452, with New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel taking four wickets. Fast bowler Finn, making his first competitive appearance since the third Test against South Africa in January, saw his opening delivery take the shoulder of Ian Westwoods bat on its way to Nick Compton, another England international, at fourth slip.

Political parties have one undisputed leader - WP Chief Minister

The lesson that each political party has one undisputed leader only had to be taught to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Western Province Chief Minister Isuru Devapriya said.
As much as an individual has only a single mother political parties too have a single leader, he said.
Addressing a press conference at the Western Province Chief Ministry Devapriya said that according to party discipline Mahinda Rajapaksa should attend the SLFP-UPFA May Day rally at Galle because he had no right to divide the SLFP or leave party stranded.
Devapriya said he was certain that all true and devout SLFPers would attend the party May Day rally held at Samanala grounds, Galle.
He said certain SLFPers had become puzzled owing to the statements made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. According to information received by him the SLFP-UPFA May Day rally at Galle would be a colossal success as it would rally all electoral organisers, party activists, Parliamentarians and Provincial Council members and ministers together for the first time.
He said today SLFP supporters had received their due place as a result of President Maithripala Sirisenas astute leadership. He recalled that during the earlier regime SLFP ministers were not afforded plum ministries or the freedom to express their views and inner feelings.
Devapriya said we have all germinated from the original SLFP seed. True SLFPers are naot those who are vociferous today but those who stood firmly rooted to the party. There is only one SLFP May Day rally and that is the one held in Galle. There cannot be enemies within a political party. Although JVPers subscribed to discerning views they all attend the party May Day rally enmasse, so why cant true SLFPers attend their party May Day rally at Galle, he asked.
Provincial Agriculture Minister Gamini Thilakasiri, Provincial Health Minister Sumith Lal de Mendis, Education Minister Ranjith Somawansa and Co-operatives Minister Lalith Wanigaratne also attended the press conference.

Action against SLFPers defying party decisions a real possibility

All active members of the SLFP have an obligation to give prominence to the May Day rally organised by the party, SLFP Youth Front President and former MP Shantha Bandara said.
He was addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters yesterday.
Bandara said the party General Secretary had sent letters to all MPs, Provincial Councillors and former Local Government members informing the location and programme of the SLFP May Day rally, adding that all the party members are requested to attend it.
If there is a wedding ceremony of a family member dont we attend it before attending a wedding ceremony of an outsider It does not matter if you get the invitation late or even you get it at all. You should keep the day reserved to attend the SLFP May Day rally without having other arrangements. If somebody wants to attend a May Day rally organised by another party, he may do so after resigning from all the positions in the party, he said.
Bandara said the SLFP Youth Front fully backs the May Day rally led by party leader and President Maithripala Sirisena scheduled to take place at the Samanala grounds in Galle.
We request all former leaders of the party to get on to one stage and send a powerful signal to the party-men. We also warn the youths not to be carried away by the tales of divisive groups within the party as it would benefit our rivals, mainly the UNP, he said.
Reminding that the SLFP is the party which helped former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to climb up the ladder to the Presidency, he asked the former President not to pave way for the defeat of the party by helping to split it.
He observed the party leadership would be compelled to take action against those who defy the party decisions over and over again.
President Sirisena was patient as he needed to unite all in the party. However, he may have to take disciplinary action in the coming days thinking of the future of the party, Banadara said.
Commenting on the increase of VAT and Nation Building Tax, the former MP said those would definitely be a burden to the ordinary people, and expressed his opposition to the move.
He also said the government instead of agreeing to the harmful conditions of the IMF and the WB, should concentrate on dealing with other lending agencies which offer loans at low interest rates sans conditions.
SLFP Galle District organiser Thisara Gunasinghe also spoke.
