Peoples representatives should set an example: President
President Maithripala Sirisena said peoples representatives should set an example to the public through their conduct in order to create a high standard and valued political culture.
The President made these remarks during a meeting with the candidates who won the recently concluded Local Government elections representing the SLFP and UPFA, at the Presidents House in Colombo, on Sunday.
President Sirisena further said that peoples representatives should provide their contribution to solving issues of the people in accordance to a timetable, without engaging in clashes with the public, while acting in an honest and patient manner.
The President explained the need to fulfill responsibilities, free the country from fraud and corruption while listening to the peoples voice in achieving common development goals.

## Title: PEOPLES SOVEREIGNTY AND JUDICIAL POWER
## Supertitle:

PEOPLES SOVEREIGNTY AND JUDICIAL POWER
The concept of sovereignty has a different connotation in the field of international law. When the term sovereign is used by writers on international law, it describes the position of a State  whether a State is independent or whether it is subject to foreign domination. On the other hand the sovereignty in the municipal law involves a discussion of the extent of the law making powers of the main legislative authority.
The Independence Constitution was construed by the courts as conferring on the judiciary the power of judicial review, an aspect of judicial power of the constitutionality of legislation. Both the 1972 Constitution and the 1978 Constitution expressly precluded the judicial review of enacted legislation and limited it to judicial review of Parliamentary Bills within a limited period. The Constitution of 1978 by Article 3 proclaims that In the Republic of Sri Lanka sovereignty is in the People and is inalienable. Sovereignty includes the powers of government, fundamental rights and the franchise.
The 1978 Constitution provides essential links between the concept of sovereign power of the people as acknowledged in the preamble and Article 3 and the Judiciary by creating opportunities for the Supreme Court to supervise legislative and executive action which might be violative of that concept.
Judicial power
The judicial power is concerned with the ascertaining, declaration and enforcement of the rights and liabilities of the parties as they exist or are deemed to exist at the moment the proceedings are instituted.
Article 4 (c) of the Constitution enacts that: the judicial power of the people shall be exercised by Parliament through Courts, tribunals and institutions created and established, or recognized by the Constitution, or created and established by law, except in regard to matters relating to the privileges, immunities and powers of Parliament and of its members, wherein the judicial power of the people may be exercised directly by Parliament according to law.
With regard to judicial response to this provision against the background of Article 3 of the 1978 Constitution, at the outset, reference may be made to the determination of the Supreme Court with respect to the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) (Amendment) Bill. Clause 15A (1) of this Bill sought to empower the Minister to make order that a person be kept in the custody of any authority, which in effect meant that a person in judicial custody stood removed from such custody and placed under Ministerial custody. It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that this would permit the Minister to substitute his order of custody in place of the order of remand made by the High Court, in violation of Article 3 read with Article 4( c) of the Constitution. Upholding this submission, the Supreme Court determined that:
this constitutes an interference with a judicial order and is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 4(c) read with Article 3 of the Constitution, and must therefore be passed by a 2/3rd Majority and approval by the people at a Referendum as provided in Article 83 of the Constitution.
This decision may be compared with the ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in respect of the National Housing (Amendment) Bill. This Bill sought to confer power on the Commissioner of National Housing to order payment of compensation for improvement effected by person to whom State land has been given by an instrument of disposition and where such instrument is cancelled. The Bill also provided for an appeal to the Minister from the said order of the Commissioner. Commenting on these proposed provisions Supreme Court held that they appear to confer on the Commissioner a judicial power to decide the quantum of compensation.
The remedy against such an order of the Commissioner was only a right of appeal to the Minister which the Supreme Court held to be a conferment of judicial power which is in consistent with the Constitution, and may be passed only by a special Majority as required by the provisions of paragraph (2) of Article 84. It will, however, cease to be inconsistent if it is amended by granting the appeal either to a Court of Law, to a tribunal or to an institution established by law, for example, a Board of Review may be constituted under this law for the purpose of deciding an appeal.
Although the Court held that the powers sought to be conferred by the Bill on both the Commissioner and the Minister amounted to judicial power no reference was made to Article 3 which in other cases had been held to impinge on Article 4 of the Constitution. Apart from this the legislature itself does not appear to have acceded to the suggestion made by the Supreme Court to modify the Bill in bringing it to a form not inconsistent with Article 4(c). In the result Section 60(2) (a) (ii) and 60(2) (b) of the present National Housing (Amendment) Act has found its way to the statute book in total disregard of the ruling of the Supreme Court. Indeed, the lack of a procedural mechanism in the Constitution to ensure compliance with directions given or suggestions made by the Supreme Court, is a major drawback of our Constitution.
The Proscribing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and Others similar Organizations (Amendment) Bill, sought to extend the period of operation of the parent statute by a further year. Section 7 of the parent law conferred on the Minister the power to forfeit to the State of moneys, securities or credits and movable or immovable property of the proscribed organisations in the hands of any person. The Supreme Court held that: the power to make such an order of forfeiture is, in our view, the exercise of judicial power. Section 7 is therefore in conflict with Article 4(1) ( c) of the Constitution, which sets out that the judicial power of the people should be exercised by Courts, Tribunals We, therefore, determine that the Bill under consideration by us is inconsistent with the Constitution and requires to be passed by a Special majority. Another important constitutional determination involved is the State Lands (Recovery of Possession) Amendment Bill. The parent Act had provided for a quit notice to be served on a person who in the opinion of the competent authority contemplated by the Act was found to be in unauthorized possession or occupation of any State land. The proposed Bill provided inter alia that No person shall be entitled to any hearing or to make any representation in respect of (such) a notice. Responding to this clause the Supreme Court ruled that it appears to us to be inconsistent with Article 4 (c) of the Constitution in that it seeks to oust the exercise by the Court of the judicial power of the People
Singharasa case
The petitioner in Singharasa v the Attorney-General (2006), had been indicted for trial before the High Court under Emergency Regulations and the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, under charges, inter alia, for having conspired to overthrow the lawfully elected government.
After conviction by the High Court, his appeal to the Court of Appeal being dismissed (subject to a reduction in the sentence), an application for special leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was also refused.
Thereafter, the Petitioner sought to have the said order / judgment of the Supreme Court revised and / or reviewed and to have the said conviction and sentence set aside on the basis of, and pursuant to, the findings of the Human Right Committee in Geneva established under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) to which the President as Head of State had acceded to and had made a declaration inter alia recognizing the competence of the Human Right Committee to receive and consider communications from individuals subject to the jurisdiction of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.
Referring to the distinction between the Monistic and Dualist theories and holding that Sri Lanka fell into the latter category and drawing attention to the exercise of (governmental) executive power of the President to enter into treaties in terms of Article 33(1) which is subject to the mutations thereto in the context of sovereignty as laid down in Articles 3, 4 and 33(f) of the Constitution.
The Chief Justice held that the President, not being the repository of plenary executive power as in the case of the Crown in the UK, nor the repository of the legislative power of the people as decreed in Article 3 read with Article 4(a) and 75 (which lay down the law making power) exemplified by Article 76(1) as well which reveals the scope and content of the Presidents power to exercise legislative power (and there being no material showing that the President had any authority from Parliament, post or prior to making the impugned declaration, the Presidents accession to the Optional Protocol in 1988 and the Declaration made was inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution and was therefore ultra vires.
Human Rights Committee at Geneva
With regard to the Presidents accession to the said Optional Protocol as Head of State and Government, the Court held that, the Presidents said actions were also a purported conferment of a judicial power on the Human Rights Committee at Geneva to vindicate a public law right of an individual within the Republic and (is) inconsistent with the provisions of Article 3 read with Articles 4 (c) and 105(1) of the Constitution. It is here not intended to assess the Supreme Court ruling in the context of International Law.
Whatever the observations may be that have been made in that context with regard to its consequences and effect, it cannot be disputed that, the petitioner in the case was seeking to have his conviction set aside or to secure a retrial on the basis of the findings of the Human Right Committee at Geneva referable to the Presidents said accession and declaration, after his conviction had been confirmed by the apex Court of Sri Lanka.
Undoubtedly this is a situation brought about by the purported exercise of executive power by the President, which power is also reposited in the people, but without reference to the people at least through the conduit of the peoples legislative power vested in Parliament, with or without necessity for a referendum. It is submitted with respect that, whatever bearing that ruling may have on International Law, the said Supreme Courts ruling must rank as a bench mark in upholding the concept of sovereign power of the people as contained and entrenched in Article 3 of the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka.
Sovereignty of the People is the primary source from which the Constitution derives its validity. Constitutional doctrines and concepts such as the separation of power and Constitutionalism therefore must be defined and interpreted to give effect to the concept of sovereign power of the people.
The whole structure of the Constitution is founded on Article 3. Article 4 of the Constitution is complementary. Consequently, in the event of a conflict or an apparent conflict between the two articles, Article 3 must necessarily prevail, for the ultimate source of power is the people.
Section 3 of the first Republican (1972) Constitution merely acknowledged the concept of sovereign power of the people linking it to the political mandate theory. In contrast, Article 3 of the present Constitution has been given entrenched status. Consequently, it is not only necessary but also imperative to look beyond the mere letter of the Constitutional document in as much as its spirit is not confined to that document.

Putins Victory
Even before I finished high school, I wanted to work in intelligence. Soon after, I decided I wanted to be a sailor, but then I wanted to do intelligence again. In the very beginning, I wanted to be a pilot.
Even Vladimir Putin did not think in his early days that he would one day become the President of the Russian Federation, earlier known as the Soviet Union. But yesterday, he was confirmed as President for the fourth time for another six years with a mandate of 76 percent of the vote at the Presidential Election. This makes him the first Kremlin leader to serve two decades in power since Josef Stalin. He was President from 2000, except for four years from 2008 when he was Prime Minister. His victory was anticipated ever since the election was announced.
Russians had a choice of eight candidates, including the Communist Pavel Grudinin, whose ownership of a former state fruit farm has made him a millionaire, and Ksenia Sobchak, the daughter of Putins political mentor. Putin has emerged as a very powerful figure in world politics and some polls had ranked him as the most powerful man on the planet, ahead of the US President. The shenanigans and intrigue of international politics are not a strange phenomenon for Putin, with his KGB background.
Putin is no stranger to controversy and recently created a frenzy by declaring during his annual address that Russia possessed invincible nuclear weapons. He is also facing a diplomatic showdown with the US and UK after the latter directly accused the Kremlin of orchestrating the recent nerve agent attack on former double agent Sergei Skripal. Putin has since stressed that Russia does not possess such military-grade chemical agents.
Putin has also defied US and EU sanctions over the 2014 Crimea issue and pressure over his support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Russia has also been accused of meddling in the elections of the USA, Germany and several other countries. US Officials have said Russian backed hackers are carrying out rolling attacks on infrastructure facilities in the USA.
In a move that ruffled a few feathers in Western capitals, Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping have developed a close relationship. In fact, following President Putins victory, President Jinping said Sino-Russia ties at the best level in history. Putin has strived to improve relations with key non-Western nations in recent times.
These issues and challenges have boosted his image domestically, even though the Russian economy is stagnating after the longest recession in two decades. Interestingly, there is no indication yet that he is grooming anyone for 2024 and beyond, despite hinting that this could be his last term.
Sri Lanka and Russia have a very healthy diplomatic relationship after formal ties were established in February 1957 during Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes tenure. However, links between the two countries go back much further. Ceylon was mentioned in the memoirs of Russian merchant and traveller Afanasiy Nikitin as early as in the late 15th century. The idea of opening a Russian consulate in Sri Lanka was first raised in 1858, but the first official representative was appointed only 30 years later. Even at times when the Western bloc voted against Sri Lanka at the UN on various matters, Russia always voted in favour of Sri Lanka or used its veto power.
Last year, President Maithripala Sirisena visited Russia to mark 60 years of diplomatic ties between the two nations. In a unique gesture of friendship, President Putin presented to President Sirisena a highly valuable Kandyan era Kastane (sword) acquired by Russia at a Sothebys auction in London in 2006. The President in turn presented it to the Colombo National Museum. President Putin had earlier accepted an invitation to Sri Lanka and this may come to fruition this year.
The two countries are close trading partners, with much room for expansion. Sri Lankas total trade (both imports and exports) with the Russian Federation was at US$ 435.83 Million in 2015 and from January to August 2017, it was US $ 260.78 Million. Russia has been one of the biggest buyers of Ceylon Tea - In 2015 Russia was the top buyer of Ceylon Tea at US$ 156.65 Million, and the second leading buyer was Turkey. However, in 2016, Russia became the second largest buyer of all types of Ceylon Teas (including green tea made in Sri Lanka) at US$ 143 Million while the leading buyer in 2016 was Iran. Increasing numbers of Russian tourists are also visiting Sri Lanka due to easier flight links. There is no doubt that the links between the two countries will get stronger over the next years.
All eyes will be on Russia this year as the Soccer World Cup is staged in venues across the country from June 14. This will be an opportunity to showcase Russia at its finest. Putin will no doubt use this opportunity to bring the world together in his country and project the image of a dynamic, youthful Russia to the rest of the world.

## Title: RECOVERING THE HUMAN
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, March 20, 2018 - 01:00
RECOVERING THE HUMAN
The government has made education compulsory for thirteen years and plans to make Sri Lanka a hub of education. If properly done, it has the potential of making many individuals conscious of humanness in themselves and in all others. This enables them to coordinate their complex relationships in an acceptable way and bring about a well-ordered civilized and cultured society which will contribute to further the progress of the people of Sri Lanka and Asia. Needless to say, it is also the way to progress on the road to reconciliation and avoid the path to mad and mindless violence and disintegration in Sri Lanka that has caused widespread dissatisfaction and sadness.
The violence that has caused disintegration is directly due to a lack of a moral sense, civic responsibility on the part of many citizens as also politicians, agents of law and order and high administrators who have been indecisive, spineless and vacillating. This has been due to an insufficiently developed humanness and consciousness.
INTEGRATION IN HUMANNESS
Every person has the capacity to grow, to mature, to be independent and free, to perceive and know, to feel, to express, to relate to others, to judge, think, reflect, understand, will and act. Each of these capacities are multidimensional and complex. Yet they could be developed and activated simultaneously. They could be separately or jointly, fairly, fully or barely developed or left undeveloped and neglected according to the manner of home upbringing and school education.
It needs to be observed that the human being, unlike an animal, is not born with instincts; the human being has only reflexes, which too needs to be developed, as in learning to drive a motor car. The human being has to learn everything from learning to stand straight, to walk with head held high, to speak clearly and to relate to family and strangers.
One could be physically grown but not be consistent and mature. One could be very active externally but intellectually inactive or active only minimally. While one has developed prejudices and strong feelings, he may have unexamined and superficial intellectual development, understanding and interior convictions. Though one may be curious about day-to-day news, one may be carried away by spurious propaganda, a mere hearsay or rumour and not investigate or have a desire for truth.
It is not all who learn even the basics through their family upbringing and through their school education. When the upbringing whether in a royal family or a rural peasants or any family has been shoddy and defective, even education in a prestigious school by itself may not humanize the individual sufficiently. Patience and kindness, clarity of thought expression and relations of others may stimulate some to the recovery and integration in humanness.
Religious, ethnic, cultural, linguistic and other groups may have an understanding of ones identity. However it is wholesome only when with ones own human dignity one takes into account, as a result of ones consciousness, the important values that accept and respects the humanity and the identity of others.
WHAT MAKES US CIVILIZED
Anyone, well-bred at home, educated in school and well-formed in character and intelligence could become a civilized person able to choose between good and evil. Doing what is good and right is creative. A human being is meant to be creative. Doing evil is being destructive. In our context, those who have done irreparable harm to life and property have done evil; those who have killed journalists and made people to disappear have done evil; those who have been plundering, misusing peoples money and banking it abroad in secret accounts and laundering money are evil; those who have borrowed billions of dollars in the name of the people and are not able to account for it are evil; the cunning rogues who have stolen money and hidden them in hitherto undetectable places are evil.
Politicians making solemn promises to clean-up such corruption and getting elected and turning back on their promises are accomplices of evil; those who have been secretly involved in the bond scam have done evil; those who have done harm to the Muslims in Ampara, Teldeniya, Digana and Kandy are evil. Those who accommodate themselves to evil are also evil.
Though these people may not get punished in proportion to the vast destruction they have caused to the country, the evil in their hearts will not be erased. While their tarnished character will remain marred with evil and continue to perpetuate great evil unless they are prevented in carrying out evil deeds by law if law is strong and effective. Organised and well planned evil could only be controlled by those with authority empowered to do so. Those empowered to do so, do not need further authorization by politicians who remain rotten.
If citizens who in positions of influence and power have abused their position and caused much evil wish to turn over a new leaf, they should be able to rid themself of self-absorbed selfishness, rule the wayward desires of their mind and heart, and not get entrapped in their lower tendencies. Nevertheless, the persecutors of Muslims should be tried in Courts and if found guilty, confined to prison and reformed there through a programme of rehabilitation to help them arrive at a new consciousness of good citizenship.
While some think deeply, many think little or not at all. Those who think very superficially and only skim the surface of problems and blame everybody except themselves include the politicians of the political parties who are now arguing among themselves. They too need rehabilitation. A good many of them are psychologically sick and need psychiatric treatment to help them accept the depth of their involvement in evil. A wholesome rehabilitation should include a formation of conscience, will and character which need to be unified and integrated.
COMPARTMENTALIZED LIVING
The human, physical, intellectual, psychological, social and spiritual aspects in the life of many prominent people have been compartmentalized. They should be helped to unify and integrate them through a recovery of humanness.
Compartmentalizing aspects of life subconsciously isolates values. For example, a person compartmentalizes religion and worship in one compartment, do political party activities in another compartment, responsibilities of public office, life with neighbours, life with wife, children and relatives in separate compartments. These compartments remain air-tight, discordant and unrelated to one another. For example, the person who worships in the morning, plans during the day to escape paying taxes, to take a bribe in the evening, to commit a grave injustice, to syphon off commissions and make illegal gains, to cast aspersions on someone and destroy him, to take French leave, to neglect and abandon ones duty, or to get paid for work not done. Corrupt practices are as many and varied as the many corrupt individuals who indulge in such evil that are so destructive of society. In such persons life is dichotomized, human values have not been instilled and integrated through proper family breeding, nurturing and a wholesome education. Such people are malformed and unaware that their evil behaviour negatively affects the lives of others; they need to be rehabilitated and brought to social consciousness.
Yet, every person remains a complex human being varying in depth and potential and has the capacity to be raised to an acceptable human level for civilized social intercourse. If sufficient resources are expended and all are rightly motivated and led, with none left behind, all could be developed so that there arises in our society citizens of integrity with a rich variety of human resourcefulness and creativity. Right understanding of the human and helpful and proper monitoring could minimize under-development in individuals and help them towards alternative possibilities of growth and human enhancement.
JUSTICE DELAYED
Some people, who for some reason or other are malformed and underdeveloped psychologically due to defective education could incite hatred among other people in a civic community. It spreads to others equally weak who without reflective thinking react with unrestrained emotion and heap wrong upon wrong thus leading even to violence, destruction, arson and anarchy even with loss of life.
The development of the sense of right and wrong, good and evil, even being shy, having the sense of guilt over wrong done and having a sense of self-restraint is part of being human. Admission of guilt, making reparation for the wrong and damage done, true repentance, resolve and promise of not repeating them and consequent forgiveness are also values that undergird equity and justice that sustain and maintain civilization and advance human progress. When justice is circumvented, manipulated and delayed by those who should be concerned - as they have been defectively educated! - the very foundations of society is undermined in the short term as well as in the long term. This is an area that is not thought of sufficiently by those in the summits of power. They are unaware that through their culpable inefficiency, evasion, inattention, indecisiveness and procrastination they not only cause evil to society, they also undermine their own credibility, integrity and security.
ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING
In the human being instincts are not developed. What we human beings have are motor reflexes, an involuntary response to certain stimuli. Doctors tests could review whether reflexes work properly. Lacking instincts, human beings have to learn almost everything from standing on two legs to walking, running, talking, speaking, eating, behaving and acting with responsibility for oneself and for others. Learning to base and activate oneself depends on and develops in intelligence, knowledge, discerning, understanding, judging and acting.
With the development of inborn talent and sufficient concentration and perseverance human beings also develop the sense of beauty, aesthetics and various crafts, arts, music and becomes creative and cultured in many surprising ways. It is this aspect of human development that enhances, completes and makes the human being the crown of all nature. All acknowledge the preciousness of human life and for most people it is a gift and a blessing to be born a human being. If such is learnt, no violence will occur.
Human ingenuity for creativity could promote many human values and enhance the lives of fellow human beings or also pave the way for the annihilation of the whole human race. This is the reason why with the advancement of science and technology, proper thinking, learning and proper education and guidance of the young from an early age to proper consciousness is so very important in order to ensure civilized and cultured living for everyone. Could emphasis on a wholesome education hub not fill the void

Removing adverse travel advisories top priority-Harry
Chairman Aitkin Spence and member of the Tourism Advisory Committee, Harry Jayawardena said that removing adverse travel advisories imposed against Sri Lanka during the Kandy crisis was of top priority.
He said that due to the emergency there is a high insurance premium for tourists and in some instances some insurance companies refuse to insure tourists coming to Sri Lanka. This is one key reason for the adverse travel advisories to remain. With the emergency being taken off the government is now renegotiating to get these travel advisories off.
Jayawardena said that the Kandy incident happened during the Chinese New Year and this was a major blow in attracting Chinese tourists to Kandy.
He stressed that during the Kandy incident none of the tourists or even their travel vehicles were targeted or damaged. Jayawardena said that during the incident their hotels offered longer check out times and even went to the extent of offering free transport to other destinations.

Violating Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance
Rs. 37 mn as fines to government coffers
The government had collected Rs. 37 million by way of fines from those violating the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance last year, Forest Conservator Nanda Kumara said yesterday.
He was responding to a query, during a press conference held at the Information Department auditorium, yesterday.
He said this sum had been collected from suspects involved in 2,563 offences in 2017. He added that the largest number of incidents was reported from the Anuradhapura district and measures had been taken to prevent such crimes.
Forest Conservator Kumara said last year, 702 incidents of illicit felling and 192 incidents of illicit timber transports were reported. He added that 437 incidents of encroachments in forest reserves and 51 illegal possessions were reported. Kumara pointed out that authorities raided 251 illegal timber depots and 789 other related offences were reported last year.
He added that there is a slight increase in forest-related offences last year compared to previous years.
Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayake stated that nearly 6,000 hectares of forest cover are destroyed each year in Sri Lanka. However, it is the lowest reported in the region.
When queried by the media about the illicit felling in the forest conservation, the secretary stated that due to various reasons, illicit felling is carried out for settlement purposes. He added that the government is taking measures to plant trees, in addition to its effort to increase the forest cover to 32 percent. The secretary said he was of the stance that people should be settled in areas where reforestation is carried out to compensate for forests destroyed in order to settle people.
Forest Conservation Department Director General Anura Sathurusinghe also spoke.

Red Sparrow
Sexualized nightmare!
Hollywood starlet Jennifer Lawrence who came into the limelight via The Hunger Games trilogy and Silver Linings Playbook takes on another physically and emotionally challenging role in Francis Lawrences Red Sparrow.
She gives life to the fiery Dominika Egorov who has to bid adieu to her career as a prima ballerina when her leg snaps loudly during a performance. Though the event was recognized as an accident her devious uncle, Ivan reveals that it was a deliberate act. He soon lures her into Sparrow School, a secret intelligence service that trains exceptional young people like her to use their bodies and minds as weapons.
True to her uncles beliefs Dominika learns the art and excels in her new found profession. She is sent off on a mission to find out the mole in the Russian service is who is feeding their information to the US during an era when another cold war has gripped the two nations.
The film is based on Jason Mathews book of the same name. Since it revolves around about spies and espionage, viewers expect a lot more action and chases to be part and parcel of the project. Instead the plot is complex and hard to digest. Though Lawrence does a marvelous job by getting into the shoes of a character that is truly alien to her, the role is not on par with spy characters such as the one Angelina Jolie played in Salt. The actions too seem overly brutal with a lot of blood shed. You also get a lot of scenes which are suitable for an adult audience.
Red Sparrow is screening at Liberty by Scope cinemas.

Smuggled cigars worth Rs 200 mn destroyed
Around 3.5 million illicit cigars worth Rs. 200 million seized by the Central Investigation Bureau of Sri Lanka Customs was destroyed by shredding at the Ceylon Tobacco Company premises, in the presence of the media and senior officials from multiple law enforcement agencies.
Sri Lanka Customs Central Investigation Bureau Superintendent G.B. Gnanaraj displays a box and a carton of the seized cigars.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Ceylon Tobacco Company, Sri Lanka Customs Central Investigation Bureau Superintendent G.B. Gnanaraj said that the total loss of revenue to the government from duty on this shipment was nearly Rs.150 million.
This container came from Malaysia addressed to a company in Colombo 3. We stopped this container on suspicion after receiving a tip-off. When the Customs stopped this container, the parties concerned wanted to divert it to India saying that it is not for Sri Lanka. We managed to identify the parties and conducted an inquiry under the Customs Ordinance, Gnanaraj said.
He further said that the country loses much revenue from cigarette and cigar smuggling. So detection is vital. But the detection of cigarettes is not an easy task. Smugglers are very smart. They know how to bring a container of cigarettes without being detected. Most of the detections are done through tip-offs received by the Customs.
The Central Investigation Bureau has an intelligence group and overseas network. With these human resources we manage to stop the smuggling. When cigarette containers are loaded at a port, they inform us. So we follow it up and see whether it is coming to Sri Lanka or anywhere else. We dont allow these illicit cigarettes to come to the market and always destroy them,  he added.

Spaeny on getting Pacific Rim: Uprising role
Cailee Spaeny found her passion for performance from singing in church and in a rock band. Each summer, for four years, she and her family would drive for three days from Missouri to
Los Angeles to go on theatrical auditions. The hard work and sacrifice paid off: Spaeny is featured in Pacific Rim: Uprising, starring John Boyega and Scott Eastwood.
It went from zero to 60 very quickly. A month before I booked Pacific Rim, I called my agent and asked her to get me a background role in the film. I made a self-tape and I went full out. Agents usually say to stand behind a blank wall, good lighting, close on your face, and not too much movement so its not distracting. I didnt do that at all. I put on a hoodie, was really sweaty, put dirt on my face, threw myself onto the floor. I pushed myself on the ground, had an actual pole in my hand, and hit a pile of pillows like I was attacking someone. I got a call about two weeks later to fly out to meet the director [Steven DeKnight], read with John Boyega and do a chemistry test, she said on how she landed the project.
She adds, When I was prepping for the role, I definitely pulled from strong females in film. Amy Adams is such a strong actress but also holds herself very well and is a super kind person. I just worked with Felicity Jones. She treats you like a human being. And of course theres John Boyega. He didnt have to take me under his wing. Ill still message him when Im nervous.

Adoption of UPR Report on Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka is a strong supporter of the UPR process - Ambassador Aryasinha
The adoption of the Universal Periodic Review Report (UPR) on Sri Lanka took place yesterday afternoon at the 37th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.
Sri Lanka was represented by Permanent Representative Ambassador Ravinatha Aryasinha and assisted by the Deputy Permanent Representative Mrs.Samantha Jayasuriya.
This was the final report of Sri Lankas review under the 3rd cycle of the Universal Periodic Review.
Making a statement on the occasion Ambassodor Aryasinha said that, Sri Lanka is a strong supporter of the UPR process.
Its peer review nature allows for open and constructive engagement that encourages countries to address important issues relating to human rights, and to learn from each other. Sri Lanka remains firm in its commitment to this process. We also remain committed to constructive engagement with the UN systems and procedures as well as engagement with individual member states in promoting human rights locally and internationally he added.
He went on to say that in the four months that have passed since Sri Lankas review in November last year, the country has already made progress on the implementation of some of the recommendations.
Aryasinha pointed out that on 5 December 2017, Sri Lanka acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, and designated the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka as the National Preventive Mechanism.
We have requested the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka to liaise with the Subcommittee to obtain the advice and technical expertise required for the effective and efficient operationalisation of the National Preventive Mechanism.
He also noted that legislation to give effect locally, to the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance was enacted by the passage of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance Bill in the Parliament on March 7,2018.
He pointed out that this criminalises Enforced Disappearance.
Aryasinha also told the council that on the recommendations made by the Constitutional Council as per the Office on Missing Persons Act, the President appointed the Chairperson and Commissioners for the Office on Missing Persons on 28 February 2018, making the Office fully operational.
Progress has also been made in the drafting of new Counter Terrorism Legislation. We envisage a Counter Terrorism Act that conforms to human rights safeguards and other international standards and we expect the draft legislation to be gazetted for tabling in Parliament for consideration, once the established procedures including translation into local languages are completed, shortly,Ambassador Aryasinha said.
He also said that the Cabinet of Ministers, on March 6,2018, approved the formulation of legislation by the Legal Draftsman, for the establishment by law of an Office for Reparations.
Aryasinha stressed that Sri Lanka has been and continues to engage actively with UN systems and procedures and across all agencies at all levels.
He also highlighted the visit of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention for an official country visit from December 4-15,2017 and Sri Lankas participation in the review on the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
He also said that amendments were brought to the Local Authorities Election Act and the Provincial Councils Election Act, ensuring a 25% quota to elect female representatives to the Councils.
For the effective implementation of the National Human Rights Action Plan 2017-2021 which was shared with all delegations in November during Sri Lankas review, a three-tier mechanism has now been established to regularly monitor progress being made by all the relevant line ministries and agencies, and to give necessary guidance and direction. All action points specified in the plan are being incorporated into the action plans of the relevant ministries and agencies he stated.
Aryasinha said that the first tier, an inter-ministerial committee, is chaired by the Prime Minister and convenes every 6 months and the second tier, which is an officials committee, is convened by the Secretary to the Prime Minister every two months and the third tier of the monitoring mechanism are ten sectoral committees at the level of ministries.
Meanwhile, on the recent incidents that took place in certain parts of Sri Lanka targeting members of the Muslim community Aryasinha said these cowardly acts instigated by some organised groups and individuals who have no place in the democratic, pluralistic society of our country. Such acts go against our shared vision of a Sri Lanka where equal rights and rule of law are guaranteed for all. We are determined to take action against all perpetrators of these incidents in accordance with the due process of the law. Victim compensation processes have already commenced; and arrests have been made as well.
He said after discovering that social media and messaging platforms were being used not only to incite and spread hate and false messages but also to organise attacks, the Government was compelled to impose temporary restrictions on the use of social media.
All these restrictions have now been lifted. The Government as a result of this experience has now entered into active engagement with social media operators, particularly facebook, to work on the prevention of hate speech, he added.
Aryasinha also told the UNHRC meeting that the emergency regulations which the Government was compelled to impose on 06 March 2018 as a measure to protect communities were rescinded on March 17,2018.
We firmly recognise that the UPR should not be a mere three-and-a-half hour dialogue that takes place every four years. Therefore, with technical assistance from the OHCHR, we are already in the process of exploring the best possible mechanism to put in place locally, for regular reporting and follow-up of recommendations emanating from the UPR process as well as other processes including the treaty body reporting and follow-up process. We appreciate the assistance in this regard that the OHCHR has offered us he added in conclusion

Sustainability  on a platter
The Road to Rights became a finalist of the United Nations SDG Action Awards under the Mobilizer category. The Awards recognizes the most outstanding and innovative efforts to inspire action on the Sustainable Development Goals, a set of goals adopted by countries to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all, as part of a new sustainable development agenda.
The Awards are powered by the United Nations SDG Action Campaign. Winners will be announced at the Awards Ceremony on March 21, during the second edition of the Global Festival of Action for Sustainable Development, the worlds annual gathering to catalyze action for the SDGs, happening in Bonn, Germany from March 21 to 23.
The Road to Rights is a unique platform where ideas are pumped from the youth. As a youth-led organization The Road to Rights work to educate and empower the younger generation through human rights education and 2030 agenda. They believe that understanding of basic values would lead to a society where people respect and love each other, especially respect everyones independence. If the SDGs are achieved, eventually human right will be preserved. With that objective, they are working on incorporating SDGs into different types of institutions, as they believe institutionalizing SDGs would bring strong impacts. They are also working on building the capacity of the younger generation from different parts of the country so that they will be able to take their own actions mobilizing their own resources. They educate, inspire, and empower people while addressing problems based on gender, peace, and environment.
In 2013 they were able to conduct the My World 2015 Global survey to collect data for drafting of the SDGs, mobilizing youth from all around the country, making sure that every voice been counted! They initiated campaigns to mobilize SDGs through rights based activities in each sector from arts to sports, as we believe Rights can make a bigger impact in fostering SDGs.
In 2016 with the support from their chapters they conducted the biggest youth summit gathering 500 youngsters from all around the world, where they strongly addressed how youth could make an impact through SDGs in their community. In 2017, they brought the SDG Media Zone to Sri Lanka with the support of many youth networks and conducted the biggest festival for SDGs, especially addressing Goal Number 16 stating the importance of Peace and Reconciliation in Sri Lanka.
As a result of that event we were able to launch My Rights My Goals National Campaign to educate young people as well as school children about 2030 agenda and strengthen them on taking actions in their own communities. Implementing Human Rights education and SDGs in to the Tourism Curriculum of University of Colombo was also one of their highlighted results.
The SDG Action Awards draw attention to the need to learn from change-makers from across the globe and celebrate the most impactful and innovative achievements contributing to the global sustainable development movement.
The first edition received over 740 nominations from seven continents and 125 countries, ranging from Zambia to Fiji, from Benin to Norway, from civil society and grassroots initiatives to public sectors and municipal government projects, as well as private sector engagements.
Finalists are being carefully reviewed by 12 prominent figures within the global SDG community.

Tesla boss in line for mega-pay deal
Electric carmaker Tesla, facing pressure on a number of fronts, is asking shareholders for a show of support for chief executive Elon Musk.
The firm has called a special meeting this month for investors to vote on a 10-year compensation plan for Musk.
Under the plan, Musk could receive stock awards worth an estimated $2.6bn - among the largest in US history.
The grants would only be distributed if the firm, which has made consistent losses, hits certain milestones.
Major holders of Tesla stock, including investment firms Baillie Gifford and T Rowe Price, have said they intend to support the pay plan, providing a vote of confidence.
But shareholder advisory groups have cautioned against the proposal, saying it is too generous.
The vote comes as Tesla confronts several years of mounting questions about its operations.
Investors are impatient about delays in the production of Model 3 cars, a new model that is supposed to target a more mass-market clientele.
US regulators have raised questions about the firm's financial disclosures, while some shareholders have complained about the board's independence and its 2016 decision to buy SolarCity, a money-losing solar power company backed by Musk and led by his cousin.
Outside the financial world, people have voiced concerns about the firm's autopilot features and workers have spoken out about abrupt dismissals and a discriminatory work environment.
Tesla has said the claims are without merit and its high public profile makes it a target. Several of the shareholder lawsuits have been dismissed.
But financial analysts are sounding warnings that the firm is losing ground against competitors. Share prices have sunk since June, though they remain about 25% higher than a year ago.
Surveys suggest the public remains enthusiastic about Tesla, though the issues may be having an effect.
A Harris Poll ranked the company's reputation third out of 100 American firms. But recent analysis by Netbase, which tracks social media posts, found Tesla compared poorly to other luxury brands.
"There's no question that the Tesla brand is a bit under fire," says Tim Calkins, a marketing professor at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.
Belief in Tesla - and Musk - has helped the firm to fend off naysayers so far.
But Calkins warns the steady drumbeat of negative press threatens to erode that faith, just as the firm is trying to win over a wider audience.
"They've raised expectations of everybody really, and when you fall short of expectations, people forgive you for a while, if you're a brand they like," Calkins says.
"If you're Elon Musk, what you're counting on is that the future is so compelling that people are going to give you time."
For years, Musk has had a seemingly magical touch, defying doubts about his endeavours.
These also include rocket company SpaceX and Neuralink, which is looking at ways to meld human and computer intelligence.

Tree planting campaign at Crow Island to mark International Day of Forests
A tree planting campaign will be held at Crow Island in Mattakuliya to mark the International Day of Forests, which falls on March 21 with the participation of senior ministers and government officials. The international community celebrates this day for the 6th time with the theme Forest and Sustainable Cities
The Forest Conservation Department had organised many campaigns to develop the forest plantation in every district in diversified ways. Plans to grow tress beside roadways and in populated places in cities are already underway. The department plans to extend the forest cover of the country to 32 percent which is currently at 28 percent.
The Forest Conservation Department with the Department of Wildlife Conservation had invested Rs. 900 million for the conservation of trees. Another two projects are underway in parallel to the tree planting campaign to increase the catchment areas of the Moragahakanda and Victoria reservoirs to 25,000 hectares each.
This is funded by the international community following the proposals made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the UN Environment Assembly held at Nairobi on December 4, 2017. The UN had awarded a grant of 38 million USD from the Green Climate Fund to the Department.
The Forest Conversation Department is confident in their newly implemented campaigns in controlling catastrophic environmental fluctuations if the campaigns prove their success.
Only three percent of the Earth is occupied by large cities and half of the world population resides in them. These citizens use 75 percent of natural resources of the world and 60  80 percent of the world energy along with a high carbon emission rate of 75 percent.
Therefore, it is vital for these cities to contribute in the highest possible way for the growth of natural forest covers.

Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Ratana Theras campaign towards bequeathing a toxin-free nation for future generations, bore signs of fruition when farmers in the Trincomalee district held a farmers conference on toxin-free agriculture at the Kantale Government Seed Farm.
The event was organised by Transparency International and held under the patronage of Ven. Ratana Thera and Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake on March 18.
Since paddy lands had been recently cultivated by Trincomalee farmers with the use of carbonic manure as a substitute for chemical fertiliser, with the aid of the fertiliser subsidy afforded by the President and the Agriculture Minister, they have flourished beyond expectations.
They main anusana at the farmer's conference was delivered by Ven. Ratana Thera, while Minister S. B. Dissanayake made a brief speech highlighting the value of this endeavour to propagate toxin-free agriculture.
Ven. Ratana Thera and Minister S. B. Dissanayake later, jointly inaugurated the harvesting by cutting the first sheaves of paddy. Subsequently, farmers began the paddy threshing process.

The UNP Parliamentary Group during the meeting with the Prime Minister had said that if the Joint Opposition were to bring a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister in Parliament, they were prepared to defeat it.
Apart from the 10 UNP Parliamentarians who are currently overseas on official visits, all other UNP Ministers and MPs took part in the meeting, a UNP member said.
The Premier had told the United National Party MPs, as the JO has not brought a No-Confidence Motion in Parliament as yet, there was no need to get perturbed over it.
The MPs had pointed out that in the event of the JO presenting a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister it should be debated at the earliest and defeated.
The UNP Parliamentary Group had also discussed about bringing necessary reforms to the party at the earliest.

USA closes anti-dumping inquiry on SL rubber bands
The United States has terminated the Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Investigations on imports of rubber bands from Sri Lanka March 15
The decision taken on March 15, 2018 at 11 am, to terminate Anti-Dumping and Countervailing Duty Investigations on Lankan rubber bands was taken at a vote held at the International Trade Commission (ITC), US.
ITCUS Chairman Rhonda K. Schmidtlein, Vice Chairman David S. Johanson, and Commissioners Irving A. Williamson and Meredith M. Broad-bent made a finding of negligibility with respect to Sri Lanka, but voted affirmative for investigations with respect to China and Thailand.
On February 21, 2018, the US announced the initiation of new Anti-dumping Duty (AD) and Countervailing Duty (CVD) investigations to determine whether rubber bands from China, Sri Lanka, and Thailand were being dumped in the United States or if producers in China, Sri Lanka, and Thailand are receiving unfair subsidies.
The US announced investigations on February 21 after a US manufacturer of rubber bands filled an Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duty Petition at the US Department of Commerce (USDOC) and US International Trade Commission (USITC) alleging that producers and exporters of rubber bands in Sri Lanka, Thailand and China are selling their products in the US market at less than normal value (dumping) and also, they have benefited from subsidies provided by respective governments.
The petitioner further alleged that these imports cause material injury or threaten material injury to the domestic rubber industry of the United States and requested the USDOC for an investigation aiming at imposition of anti-dumping , countervailing duty on imports as per the anti-dumping and countervailing Duty Laws of the United States.
Based on the petition, the USDOC and USITC initiated parallel anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations on imports of rubber bands from Sri Lanka, Thailand and China on February 21, 2018.
The Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka in collaboration with the Attorney Generals Department and the affected exporters in Sri Lanka made number of submissions to the US Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission in the preliminary investigation stage rebutting the petitioners claims.
The main argument of the Sri Lankan was that Sri Lankas value and volume of export of rubber bands (the petitioned merchandise) to the US falls below the minimum threshold to initiate an anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation as specified in the WTO Agreements. Accordingly, the ITC in the preliminary based investigation, has now determined that imports from Sri Lanka of the product was negligible in value terms.
The U.S. Department of Commerce will now terminate the anti-dumping and Countervailing duty investigations on Sri Lanka that had been initiated by the ITC. Hence, there will be no CVD or AD investigations with respect to Sri Lanka at the DOC. However, the Commission has found the exports from Thailand and China are affirmative and the investigations to be continued on those two countries.

Cambridge Assessment English
At the vanguard in teaching Sri Lankans English
In Sri Lanka, English is spoken by approximately 10 percent of the population. Across the island, however, there are language learning centres seeking to change this, offering English classes for an array of reasons a person might need language fluency: education, employment, immigration, and more. The gist is that these centres teach students in English courses, and after the course is completed, they administer a certification exam that proves a persons proficiency.
Cambridge English's Customer Services Director Andy Page speaks at the organization's recent event in Colombo
One such exam organization popular in Sri Lanka is Cambridge Assessment English, a language qualification programme connected to the University of Cambridge. Each year, over five million Cambridge English exams are taken in over 130 countries, and in Sri Lanka, the exams are administered in over 260 partner institutions.
This week, the Daily News had the opportunity to sit down with three representatives from Cambridge Assessment English - Global Services Deputy Director Liam Vint; Customer Services Director Andy Page; and Head of Business Development in South Asia, Manish Puri  who were visiting the country as a stop on a tour of South Asia to expand the scope of their programmes reach in the region. In an interview, they expressed optimism in the future of English speaking in Sri Lanka, noting that there has been a trend in the island towards their Young Learners Examinations. Still, they acknowledged that their programme, and English language learning more generally, has yet to penetrate more rural areas in the island.
The following has been condensed and edited for clarity.
Q: Why are you here today, and why are you eager to expand your programmes in Sri Lanka
A: Cambridge Assessment operates in over 170 countries. To say why were here today, its partly to do with our global scope, but also our interest in Sri Lanka in particular, as an area where there is lots of excitement about learning English - not just learning by rote, but really learning a communicative approach.
Traditionally, in countries like Sri Lanka, India, and Nepal, a lot of candidates take our IELTS (International English Language Testing System) examination, which is more popular. But the awareness in terms of what other qualifications Cambridge Assessment English has is a little low. So we would want to work with our existing partners here, including the British Council and others, to ensure that schools, colleges, and private language schools are aware.
Q: What is your relationship to the British Council and other regional partners
A: The British Council is one of our partners globally. We work with the British Council in many countries. In many places, the British Council may be one of the places that acts as a centre to deliver our exams. But we work with many other partners as well.
In terms of the British Council working with us, there are two areas. One is as a partner in a test we have called IELTS, which is geared towards people studying abroad or even for immigration purposes. In Cambridge English qualifications, we work with the British Council normally as one of our centres. Here in Sri Lanka for example, the British Council is one of the organizations that helps deliver our exams. For us, its very important to have partners on the ground - very often language teaching centres or university schools - who act as a kind of administrative centre in delivering the exams. The other thing we need on the ground is speaking examiners; so throughout the whole process, we need to ensure that our exams are administered the same way all around the world, whether its in Argentina, China, or Sri Lanka.
Q: What is your most popular English language examination in Sri Lanka
Cambridge English's Global Services Deputy Director Liam Vint presents a teaching award to a stand-out Sri Lankan language educator
A: The most popular English language examination here is the Young Learners English. its basically the primary school students who take these qualifications.
Almost 52 percent of the examinations we do here are the Young Learners Examinations. In the Sri Lankan market, we see lots of parents who are eager to introduce English language as early as possible to their children.
Q: How do your examinations for younger learners differ from the IELTS examination
A: The way we construct the examinations, from the Young Learner tests through different levels of school, is that the examinations are targeted to different school levels with concepts that students at any time should be familiar with. At a young learner stage, that could be heavily about recognition, so not requiring so much in terms of production. But as young learners work through the levels, particularly, its important to use all four skills - speaking, reading, listening, and writing (or production).
So in that sense, in terms of preparing, the idea is to expose students to and have students use a very communicative form of the English language. And then in the exam context, they are prepared and they have the opportunity to show what they can do with the language. And I think if the students engage in Sri Lanka, they perform very well.
Q: What is a recent development in language learning that youve observed
A: Cambridge Assessment has been offering English as a foreign language assessment since 1913. Whats probably different over the last 10-15 years is that previously we were more involved in the later levels of high school, with students who intended to go to university overseas. Now, were much more involved, engaged in full-time education, working with schools - state schools, religious schools, government schools, private schools - and we are seeing an ongoing progressive assessment as part of a language learning process. What were now saying is that we try and follow through with students every step of the way, and what were trying to do is stress that this is to help you learn and its not just about having proof of that language qualification.
Q: Are you involved in teaching English as well, rather than just testing people to qualify with it
A: Yes. We have teacher training as well. We teach and qualify teachers to then lead courses that would then teach and qualify students in Cambridge English. One of the biggest things weve noticed when expanding our programmes in new regions or working in countries for the first time is that governments are very keen to work first on teacher trainings for English and get them familiar with our approach, not just with the exam but with English, and only then work with those same teachers as they engage with students in schools.
Ours is a capacity-building model. We work with the teachers to improve their professional development. Apart from language qualifications, there are qualifications we have in the form of teaching awards. So we see a lot of traction with the teachers in international schools, here and elsewhere, who are ensuring they have a professional certificate, which certifies which level theyre at, not just in terms of language, but also methodology of teaching.
Q: What sets Cambridge English Assessment apart from other English language certifications
Educators take notes at Cambridge English's event in Colombo
A: Recognition is really key. Over 24,000 organizations and institutions worldwide recognize our qualifications. These are not only higher education institutions, but also major businesses, and even governments. So this is an incentive if you want to study in one of these educational institutions or get a visa or enable access to the first level of selection for job at a multinational corporation.
Its also the support that Cambridge offers thats unique to us. We provide resources to teachers, to students, to parents, from hard-copy to face-to-face to digital resources, movies and even webinars. And the certification comes from one of the worlds oldest universities; so students are assured of the quality and the standards of the exam. And we maintain these standards because everything comes from Cambridge, and everything goes back to Cambridge for marking.
Q: Have you made an effort for outreach with more rural schools, where levels of English-learning are lower
A: We depend more on the regional partners for that. We dont commonly go out to rural schools or districts, not just here, but in India also, for example. Thats how and why we work with our regional partners. We have partners not just in Colombo, but also in Negombo and in Kandy, and we depend on them to reach out. Our role is more about giving support to these centres, with our trainer trainings. But wed be quite keen to have more partners in Sri Lanka who can reach out.
We are trying to increase our government projects globally, which is another way to connect with more rural partners.

We didnt feel that we were playing outside India - Rohit Sharma
Indias victorious skipper Rohit Sharma whilst praising the Sri Lankan fans for turning up in their numbers for the final of the Hero Nidahas trophy tri-nation series at the R Premadasa Stadium on Sunday said that their support didnt make his team feel that they were playing outside India.
The crowd was brilliant, it was magnificent. To get the support from the entire crowd, I think it was 20,000-25,000 people to get their support was really good. We didn't feel that we were playing outside India, said Sharma at the post-match press conference after his team had beaten Bangladesh by five wickets to clinch a thrilling last ball victory.
They (spectators) enjoyed their cricket which is always a good thing. They came out in large numbers and their support was very crucial. It is always good when you get that support, just to get you going, it is very important. They supported us throughout the course of 40 overs. Even when we were bowling and making those stops, and when we started off batting, they were there for us, he said.
Sharma became very popular and earned more respect with the Sri Lankan fans for his humble post-victory act when he got his team to do a lap of honour with Sri Lankas legendary one-man cheer squad Percy Abeysekera.
Further after claiming an emphatic victory Sharma instead of waving the Indian tri-colour flag he took the Lankan flag from a fan and went on a lap of honour to acknowledge the local fans support.
Sharma praised the match-winning knock of Dinesh Karthik who hit the final ball for six off Soumya Sarkar after India were left chasing an improbable 34 runs off the final two overs. Karthik hit 22 runs off the penultimate over bowled by Rubel Hossain to make the impossible happen in the final over.
When you have a situation like this, you can only be positive. You have to think that you can always get it. What we think in the dressing room doesnt matter that much. Guys who are out there in the middle matter the most, because they are the ones out there taking the pressure and taking that challenge to finish off the games, said Sharma.
In the dressing room we were always positive. The reason we had Dinesh in the end is because we knew he could finish off the game for us. That was the only idea. We were all positive of the kinds of shots that he has in his hands. We always thought he could play those shots.
When I got out I went and sat in the dugout and he was quite upset that he didnt bat at six. But I told him: I want you to bat and finish off the game for us, because whatever skill you have, it will be required in the last three or four overs.
Hes batted in that position in a list of games for his state teams. Even when he was playing for Mumbai Indians with me, I knew his ability with the bat. Hes got some different types of skill shots that would probably be required at that point at the death overs. That was the only reason we held him back. I can proudly say it paid off, Sharma said.
Indias stand-in skipper commended Bangladesh for their fearless cricket and described them as a dangerous team.
Bangladesh is certainly a very good team. Definitely in this tournament they were a very dangerous team. We saw a few games when they chased more than 200 runs. Theyre very fearless. They come out, express themselves, and they enjoy cricket, said Sharma. Going forward, in the last three years, weve seen how theyve changed their style of cricket. The senior guys are there in the team and there are a few new faces. Thats always a good combination to have, when you have mixture of youth and experience, you always get the result you want.
I won't say they are not good enough. Bangladesh certainly has great talent in the squad. Even today (Sunday), it was a close finish, it wasn't that we came out here and smashed and won the game. We had to earn that victory and it is a good sign for their cricket. They shouldn't be disappointed; they have a long way to go.
At the start of the tournament, they played some really good cricket and the two games they won against Sri Lanka was there for all of us to see, you know what kind of players they have and what sort of cricket they play. They play fearless cricket, it's always good. Sometimes, it can bite you when things don't go your way but that is the style of cricket they want to play, said Sharma.
Bangladesh were left wondering of what might have been after coming so close to lifting a trophy. They have now lost five tournament finals in the limited-over formats including a similar tight last over defeat against Pakistan in the 2012 Asia Cup final where they failed to make nine runs off the last over.

## Title: Will regulating Social Media stop hate speech
## Supertitle:

## Date: Tuesday, March 20, 2018 - 01:00
Will regulating Social Media stop hate speech
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe recently said that Sri Lanka would have new laws enacted to regulate social media and hate speech. He added he is fully aware of the importance of social media and the Governments objective is only to minimise its negative use.
The social media are a recent invention. The two most popular websites, Facebook and Twitter, were founded in 2004 and 2006 respectively. They may be new, but they are big. Nearly 1.2 billion people regularly use Facebook and 255 million regularly use Twitter. There are many other social media forums, based all over the globe, with different focuses of activity, all with the purpose of social networking, or connecting people to express themselves and interact with each other.
As John Cooper QC, politician and human rights expert, says, the vast majority of people who use the social media are like society. The majority are decent, intelligent, inspiring people. The problem comes with a small minority, as in society, who spoil it for everyone else
How can this minority spoil it for everyone There are number of ways: cyber bullying, revenge porn, trolling, virtual mobbing, posting hate messages. (Trolling happens when someone creates conflict on sites by posting messages that are particularly controversial or inflammatory. Virtual mobbing occurs when a number of individuals use social media to make comments about another individual, because they are opposed to that persons opinions.)
In recent years, we have seen conspiracy theories trend on social media platforms, fake Twitter and Facebook accounts stoke and religious social tensions, external actors interfere in elections and criminals steal troves of personal data.
German experience
Prime minister also said that he has advised Foreign Affairs Ministry to look at how other countries are working on filtering social media. For a brief study, we will take Germany and UK.
In Germany, a law came into force in January that foresees fines of up to 50 million (Rs. 6900 million) for social media platforms that fail to remove hate speech within 24 hours.Social networks are no charity organizations that guarantee freedom of speech in their terms of service, said Gerd Billen, an undersecretary in Germanys justice and Consumer Protection ministry. Social networks, he said, had to comply with German law and not only with their own rules.
We cannot simply accept the fact that illegal Fake News impact our democratic elections or that (online) hate crimes poison our public discourse, Billen added.
The German law forces major social networks to withhold certain comments or posts from users in the country if they are deemed illegal and offensive and were reported by users. The networks such as Facebook, Twitter or Instagram now face fines if they systematically fail to comply with the 24-hour deadline.
The German law, Network Enforcement Act, is an international test case. How it plays out is being closely watched by other countries considering similar measures. German Government also said that they want to add an amendment to help web users get incorrectly deleted material restored online.
The legislation was introduced amid a recent spike in online hate speech and complaints by authorities that the sheer volume of incidents has become difficult to prosecute. All social networks have fallen in line with the new legislation.
Leading social networks such as Facebook and Twitter have acknowledged some failures in the past but emphasized that they will voluntarily step up efforts to combat online hate crimes.
UK experience
UK government, too, has unveiled sweeping plans to regulate the internet, which they claim will stop the web being used to tackle bullying, hate posts and other abuses. The UK government hopes to introduce new taxes on social media companies which will be used to improve the quality of internet. Social media companies will also be asked to commit to a code of conduct
We just want to make sure that we do regulate the social media in appropriate way, so that we allow the freedoms the internet gives you, said UK Culture Secretary Karen Bradley in an interview.We need an approach that protects everyone without restricting growth and innovation in the digital economy. We want the Government, industry and communities to work together to keep citizens safe online, she added.
The UK government is also considering changing the legal status of Google, Facebook and other social network companies amid growing concerns about copyright infringement and the spread of extremist material online. Social media networks are currently considered conduits of information rather than publishers under UK law, meaning they have limited responsibility for what appears on their sites.
However, the previous chairman of Ofcom, UKs communications regulator, Patricia Hodgson said she believed the likes of Google and Facebook were publishers, raising the prospect that they could eventually face more regulation.
We need to be careful here that what we do is not a sledgehammer to crack a nut. But we have to do this in a way that doesnt allow harm to anyone, she added.
Different angle
In todays digital landscape, some analysts believe, that regulation alone is not the answer for fake news or hate posts, although it is being welcomed by most people. The Government may implement a set of laws which enable hefty fines for social media companies which fail to take down obviously illegal content within specified time limit. However, two important aspects should be considered before doing so.
First, the costs of legislation which might outweigh the benefits.
Second, the dangerous effects of such legislation. Placing legal responsibility on social media companies to identify the lawfulness of content on their platforms will create an atmosphere where they will take unwarranted caution to avoid issues. Beyond undermining the right to free speech, companies may even censor important public feedback, for example, on Governmental corruption.
Maybe, we need to look for a solution in a different angle. In the traditional print, radio and TV media space, we have seen how the media companies generally censor themselves to prevent publishing content which violates standards of public decency. We must, however, recognize that unlike traditional media companies, where content is generated by small group of individuals, social media platforms represent a very broad base of content producers and users. That is why social media platforms are considered as avenues for public interests to be represented.
So, we have the Government on one side and the social media platform on the other side, both claiming to be stewards of public interests. If we proceed further with this paradigm, we need to take three mutually agreeable steps to solve this problem.
First, both parties should agree on the content standards to be interpreted and operationalized on social media platforms. This has to be done through an inclusive mechanism. When it comes to interpreting content laws, the scale and speed of the digital world make court decisions impractical. The best idea is for Governments and social media companies to co-develop a swift mechanism which allows a spectrum of public voices to influence the interpretation of content laws in grey cases.
Second, the Government and social media companies should establish a system of public accountability.

Window to Japan
Japanese TV programs dubbed in Tamil commenced telecasting on February 20 on the Reconciliation Channel (Nethra TV). These TV programs from Japan include documentaries on Japanese industry, technology, economy, nature, science and environment as well as educational programs for children.
The programs are being dubbed into Sinhala and Tamil, so that they could be easily understood by all communities in Sri Lanka. (The Sinhala version of those TV programs will start telecasting later on a different Rupavahini channel, which is yet to be announced.)
The Japanese Government granted 449 TV programs, worth of 52.6 million Japanese Yen to Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation in order to enhance awareness of Japanese culture, value and lifestyle among Sri Lankan viewers nation- wide.
Japanese Government also granted Rs. 42.7 million to cover part of the cost for dubbing Japanese programs into Sinhalese and Tamil, producing of trailers and crawlers as well as allocating airtime for them.
The Japanese Embassy in Sri Lanka hopes that these programs would promote the understanding about Japan among Sri Lankan people and thereby contribute to deepening the ties between Japan and Sri Lanka.

World Oral Health Day
Today (Tuesday, March 20) is World Oral Health Day. The day will be celebrated under the theme of
Say Ahh - Think mouth - Think health island wide with several programmes with the contribution of the Health Ministry, Education Ministry and Sri Lanka Dental Association. Over 190 countries will celebrate this day, Dental Surgeons said.
Addressing a media seminar held at the Health Promotion Bureau in Colombo yesterday the organisers said that according to the statistics gathered in 2003, 65 percent of Sri Lankan children at the age of six have at least four decayed teeth while 40 percent of Sri Lankan children at the age of 12 have at least one decayed tooth.
The public should check the ingredients of the toothpaste they buy and buy only toothpaste that contain fluoride. Often Ayurvedic toothpaste brands do not contain fluoride.
Fluoride is essential to protect teeth. Sweets and junk food should be avoided and health food such as fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, cheese, yogurt etc should be taken in order to protect teeth, they said.
Deputy Director General (Dental Services) Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that Rs. 400 million has been allocated this year to provide facilities for state dental surgeries in the country and 77 more dental surgeons would be recruited shortly to the service.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has planned to attach one dental surgeon for each and every MOH division (around 341) in the country. They will be given all facilities including a vehicle to upgrade the countrys oral health.
At the moment, there are 1,496 dental surgeons in the country.

Hat-Trick  champs
The Interact Club of Zahira College and the Rotaract Club of Colombo Fort organised the sixth installment of Hat-Trick. The flagship project of the two clubs sets an example among other Interact and Rotaract clubs through their strong bond. What makes Hat Trick different from other cricket tournaments is its unique layout and the manner in which it brings together the young generation of the country. .
An event launch for Hat trick 18 was held at the Zahira College, Swimming Pool Complex recently. The event launch saw young cricketers setting the draw and the organizing committee presented the rules and regulations of the draw. It was important in letting the young cricketers know about the limitations and boundaries to make sure Hat Trick 18 would run smoothly without hassle.
Hat-trick18 was held at the Sri Lanka Moors Sports Club from 8 am. The organizers pulled together a masterpiece by ensuring that 60 matches were conducted during the day and received positive feedback from many of the participants. Around 32 teams too part in Hat-trick 18.
The tournament eventually saw the champions of Interact Premier League (The Interact Club of DS Senanayake) and Rotaract Premier League (The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa Alumni) battling it out for the Hat Trick Cup. The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa Alumni was crowned as the champions of Hat-trcik 18 after they beat the Interact Club of D S Senanayake. The ladies of The Rotaract Club of Moratuwa Alumni were also crowed Hat Trick Womens Champions as they took home both Crowns and cash prizes. It was a night of celebration.
The tournament also offered Bowl and Plate championships to other participating clubs and thereby created a very competitive atmosphere for all participating Interact and Rotaract Clubs. Individual awards like Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best Fielder and Man of the Tournament were also handed out.
The cricket tournament ended with a Hopper Night. All the spectators and participants embraced a fantastic night of fellowship after the awards ceremony that was lit up with fireworks. On the lighter side the Hopper station clearly had a tough time catering to scores of Rotaractors and Interactors with more than 500 hoppers being consumed that night.
The project chairpersons Rtr. Nazmi Mahamood and Int. Mohamed Rishad thanked their team for the effort. Chief Guest Rtn. Priyan Hettipathirana, President of Colombo Fort Rotary Club distributed prizes to the winning teams.

No Confidence Motion against PM is pointless
No point of bringing in a No Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Assistant Secretary Dr. Navin De Soyza said.
He was addressing the media personnel during a press conference held in Colombo yesterday evening. Dr. Soyza said a No Confidence Motion should be brought in against all 225 Parliamentarians and not only against the Prime Minister. Parliament is full of uneducated persons. They cannot take the country forward, Dr. Soyza said.
Sri Lanka is another developing country even after 70 years of its independence thanks to our politicians, while other countries have well developed their resources empowering their citizens, he said.

None can topple Good Governance regime
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa recently told foreign media that the government would fall. It is not an easy task to topple the Good Governance regime, Rural Economy Minister P. Harrison said.
He was addressing Nachchaduwa farmers following the distribution of agricultural appliances worth Rs. 50 million under the Ministry's Rural Economic Development Programme.
Referring to the No Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Harrison said that no UNP parliamentarian had signed it; only 40 Opposition members had signed it. They do not have majority to win, the Minister added.
"Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha and Lands State Minister T. B. Ekanayake supported the No Confidence Motion proposal. We are a national government supported by a number of political parties and we cannot act against anyone who opposes the government, while being in the government," the Minister said.
"We are expected to work jointly and in unity. It would be more respectable to leave the government before criticising it or put forward one's stand over any issue. It is shameful to work against the government, while being under its shelter," Minister Harrison added.
The Minister said the government did not allow or support former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran to flee the country. It is the duty of the judiciary to deal with the issues. The judiciary should have cancelled his passport in order to prevent him from leaving the country. It is unjust to blame the government.
The Minister said similar to the Red Notice issued for the arrest of former Sri Lankan Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, the same had been issued for Arjuna Mahendran. The law is common to every citizen without any discrimination, he said.
Minister Harrison said proposed three-judge bench High Court was not aimed at a particular party or individual.
The proposed judge bench would punish any individual being convicted. The government had held a discussion to establish a new judiciary, he said.

SL to slash aircraft landing charges
The Colombo International Airport will soon see a reduction of landing charges, said Minister of Christian Affairs and Tourism John Amaratunge.
Speaking at the special press conference with some of the leading stakeholders of the industry yesterday the Minister said that this is mainly to bring the Colombo airport charges in line with other neighbouring airports and also woo more airlines to fly to Colombo.
The Minister also said that the Ampara airport too would be opened very soon as a domestic airport and they are working to add more facilities to the Ratmalana airport.
We are currently having some minor issues with the Air Force and they would be ironed out soon and these are being done to mainly promote domestic airlines to operate in Sri Lanka, he said.
Commenting on the Sri Lanka tourism sector in the aftermath of the Kandy incident, emergency and adverse travel advisories, he said that there was no a major negative impact from it to the industry.
The industry after going through a drop is now showing a 20% growth and this trend is expected to continue.
With this trend we estimate that we will be able to achieve over 2.5 million arrivals.
The industry saw US$ 3.5 billion revenue and Sri Lanka also hopes to better it to US$ 3.8 billion by end of 2018.
Chandana Perera (Emirates) representing the airline sector said that there were some pax cancellations from the Gulf but there were no flight cancellations. He Minister said that steps were taken to deduce the impact of the incident and allowing foreigners to travel by producing their passports as curfew passes during curfew time was one such move.
However, when Daily News Business asked about a helpline number to be used by tourists during a crisis none of the officials in the head table knew about it. It was later announced that the helpline number is 1992.
Managing Director, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Sutheash Balasubramaniam said that they will now launch an aggressive marketing campaign especially in the forth coming Arabian Travel Mart in Dubai, Chinese Travel show and future road shows.
We will allocate USS 650, 000 for promotions with CNN and a further US$ 35 million for future digital destination promotions.
In addition he said that a Rs. 6 billion promotional campaign is now on for a period of three years.

World TB Day falls on March 24
TB, AIDS cause worlds highest number of deaths
Dr. D. Medagedara said at a press briefing held in Colombo yesterday that AIDS and TB are communicable diseases that cause the largest number of deaths in the world and that a large number of people in the developing countries die of Tuberculosis (TB) every year although it is curable if treatment are taken properly.
The World TB Day is observed every year on March 24 to create awareness and support world-wide efforts to eliminate TB. The annual event commemorates the date in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced his discovery of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, the bacillus that causes TB. This years World TB Day theme is Leaders for a TB free world you can make History. End TB. The day is an occasion to mobilise political and social commitment for further progress towards eliminating TB as a public health burden.
TB can acquire by breathing contaminated air droplets coughed by a nearby person who has active tuberculosis. The most common term of the Pulmonary TB, which affects the lungs, and brain. In some cases, the bacteria can also attack the lymphatic system, nervous system, joints and bones. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is present worldwide and typically spreads in cramped, overcrowded conditions. Long-term travellers, those with a weakened immune system or visiting friends and relatives in areas where Tuberculosis is endemic are at risk. Humanitarian and healthcare personnel working in communities with active TB are also at increased risk. Persons with active TB should not travel.
Dr. Medagedara said that the Persons with active TB have symptoms which include excessive coughing (sometimes with blood), chest pain, general weakness, lack of appetite, weight loss, swollen lymph glands, fever, chills, and night sweats.
Dr.N. Dissanayaka said the majority of persons with the illness (90 to 95 percent) have latent TB infection (LTBI) and do not exhibit any symptoms. The bacteria can remain inactive for many years and the chance of developing active TB diminishes over time.
TB prevention consists of several main parts. The first part of TB prevention is to stop the transmission of TB from one adult to another. This is done through firstly, identifying people with active TB, and then curing them through the provision of drug treatment. With proper TB treatment someone with TB will very quickly not be infectious and so can no longer spread the disease to other. Dr. C. Kulathunga added. There were more than 9,000 Tuberculosis patients in Sri Lanka. The World Tuberculosis Day was marked this year on Saturday, March 24. The latest value for Incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) in Sri Lanka was 65 as of 2016. At present there are 26 districts chest clinics. In patient facilities are provided through national hospitals for respiratory diseases and chest wards in the hospitals, diagnostic services are carried out through the national TB reference laboratories , regional culture laboratories district chest clinics and microscopy centers.
All the districts chest clinics are under the control of a district TB control officer and consultant respiratory physicians. Anyone having cough for more than two weeks can straight away go to a clinic without a reference. All investigations and treatments are provided free of charge. Government funds are available for the patients. The Welisara Hospital has separate wards for patients with Multi Drug Resident with Tuberculosis MDR-TB, Dr.B. Samarasekara said.

Including Monday's announcement, Alibaba will have ponied up a total of $4 billion to invest into Lazada, which has operations in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Singapore.
Alongside the investment, Alibaba said that the start-up would also have a new CEO.
Lucy Peng, a co-founder at Alibaba and currently Lazada's chairwoman, would take on the additional role from current chief Maximilian Bittner.
Bittner, who has been CEO since 2012, will take on a senior advisory role at Alibaba.

Allianz introduces 3D Solera App
Allianz Lanka announced the launch of Allianz 3D Solera App, a revolutionary, mobile-based, assessment application that is set to transform Sri Lankas motor insurance landscape.
Rewriting the rules of accident damage assessment, the Allianz 3D Solera App enables policyholders to carry out vehicle inspections by themselves in the unfortunate event of an accident. They simply need to photograph their vehicle using the app, mark the damaged area in its 3D garage and share the images with Allianz.
Having completed this simple, three step process, they can immediately move the vehicle from the spot and continue with their day to day lives. Thus, it eliminates the need to wait for assessors to visit the accident site to evaluate the damage.
Reviewing the images received, Allianz Lankas engineers assess the damage, compute the settlement amount and send an SMS update to the policyholder within a day. The claims team then gets in touch with the policyholder on the following day to get additional details and check if he / she is okay with the offered amount. Once an agreement has been reached, the funds are transferred to the policyholders bank account on the next working day.
Thus, the Allianz 3D Solera App helps policyholders save a considerable amount of time and effort. Streamlining the entire claims process, right from accident reporting to claims settlement, it has also made it completely paperless.
At Allianz, we continue to harness the power of technology to offer greater convenience to our customers around the world. In line with this, we are delighted to dedicate the Allianz 3D Solera assessment mobile application to our customers in Sri Lanka, Surekha Alles, Managing Director, Allianz Insurance Lanka said.
Allianz Lanka policyholders can download and install the Allianz 3D Solera App for free directly from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store or from Allianz Lankas website.
They can also download it through the SMS notification they receive at the time of making a claim with Allianzscall center. The insurer is initially piloting this service between 6a.m. to 6p.m., 7 days a week, to private motorcar owners alone.
Allianz Insurance Lanka Ltd. and Allianz Life Insurance Lanka Ltd., known together as Allianz Lanka, are fully-owned subsidiaries of Allianz SE, Germany, a world leader in integrated financial services.

Ananda Jayatilleka a talent that was lost to Sri Lankan Cricket
Last week whilst mingling with my past school mates at the Ananda Nalanda match, I spotted a guy who stood out of the ordinary, ebony in colour with a head of striking silver hair who certainly looked like an ex West Indian Cricketer. Inquiries revealed that he is none other than Ananda Jayatilleka(AJ) popularly called ANA by his friends who said that he not only looked like a West Indian but batted like one, he was a treat to watch they said. I was not fortunate enough to see him play as I was overseas at that time.
As far as I can recollect AJ was the only player who has represented both Ananda & Nalanda in first eleven cricket. At 15 he was in the Nalanda team under Anura de Silva. Interestingly the next year at the age of 16 a strange shift of schools found AJ opening batting for Ananda with Sunil Wettimuny. In the next three years AJ gave Ananda batting a new dimension with stylish stroke play, drawing crowds to the famous Campbell Place grounds where many top bracket cricketers displayed their skills. Many who witnessed his batting sitting under the big Mara trees still talk of AJs iconic  late cut seen last off the bat of famous late Mahadevan Sathasivam who was a batting great of Ceylon.
AJs skills were recognised by the men who mattered and was selected to represent Ceylon schools. Subsequently the famous Indian tour of the Ceylon Schools Team took place and without doubt laid the foundation for Sri Lanka Cricket today. It produced four National cricketers including two Sri Lanka captains in Duleep Mendis & Bandula Warnapura. AJs outstanding batting and wicket keeping led him to be adjudged the BEST CRICKETER OF THE TOUR from both Ceylon and Indian teams winning the IRENE AWARD presented by the Indian Cricket Board, an accolade of excellence for Sri Lanka when cricket was not so lucrative and professional like today. AJ was of the view that his cricket peaked during that Indian tour.
AJ was offered employment at ARPICO by P I Pieris who was the vice captain of the All Ceylon team then and was absorbed to play for SSC in the Sara Trophy . He kept wickets for SSC under Anura Tennakoon and Sunil Wettimuny.Changing lanes a bit now. His employment involved studies in Rubber Technology at the Moratuwa University which partly hindered his cricket. Incidentally AJ not only excelled in cricket but in his studies as well obtaining 6 Ds out of 8 subjects at OLs which was outstanding at the time. His involvement in studies took him off cricket which cost him a definite place in the National side. However, AJ had no regrets since he had stamped his mark in the corporate world, due to his professional qualifications. He was instrumental in starting several new companies for ARPICO including Richard Pieris Exports PLC that has added so much value to the national economy today. Starting as a Management Trainee AJ rose to be a senior main board Director of Richard Pieris & Company. His contribution to the Rubber Industry was recognized by way of a merit award by the Plastics & Rubber Institute of Sri Lanka. He later started a new export venture company by the name Latex Green as Chairman/MD and presently serves in several boards under the John Keells & Hayleys groups.
Whilst he was employed in Zambia from 1978 to 1984 in the Copper Mines and later in General Tyre. He represented the Zambian National Cricket Team and was unlucky to miss playing for East African Team in the world cup for not having the required period of residency in Africa. His records show some good performance by him for Zambia against leading teams like the MCC.
AJ,s cricketing achievements in India and Zambia were numerous and to do justice to a few of them, I would like to include some snippets from the news papers of those countries:
TIMES OF INDIA
Ceylon schools reign supreme- Wettimuny, 5 for 30; Jayatillake, 72, rattle Indians, it further stated,The lad who started the ball rolling was opener Ananda Jayatillake who hit the Indian bowlers to the tune of 72 runs. He was a picture of elegance as he stroked his way in to the runs. He cut and drove the bowling with great confidence and had complete command over the bowlers.
The hindu-Feb 2 1970
Bannerjees inspired display in vain: Ceylon schools win series
One notable feature in Ceylons fielding was the excellent work of wicket keeper Jayatilleke. A frail looking youngster he impressed everyone with his agility and anticipation, he claimed four victims.
Zambian Times
Tanzania Vs Zambia- Brilliant batting by Jayatillake together with Patel helps Zambia to beat Tanzania.
Zambia Vs Minor Counties- Zambia started off badly losing opener Sunil Eratne(another old Anandian) with the total at six. Of the early batsmen only Ananda Jayatilleke displayed any confidence, against the counties attack, but he was unfortunately run out for two.
NKANA A batsman destroys Roan
A brilliant century by opening batsman Ananda Jayatilleke helped his club to pile up a mammoth score of 304 for the loss of only 4 wickets in the 40 overs Henderson cricket trophy against Roan in Luanshya on Sunday.His score of 135 came in only 101 minutes off 93 balls and included 5 sixes and 14 hits to the boundary.
AJ admits that his cricketing skills was mainly due to watching cricket being played at the Railway grounds in Mount Mary. He was fortunate to have a Birds eye view from the Prisons Quarters where he lived during his school days. AJ honed his skills by hitting a table tennis ball using a broom stick, his imagination running riot imitating many famous names of the time.
AJ is a classic example of how one could make use of cricket to build a good personality and be a good leader and create value for the nation as a true sportsman.

Applause for cats-paws fully smitten by a kitten
You may like cats or not, but one thing is clear to everybody: They are incredibly complex creatures and they often do the exact opposite of what you would expect. They possess an astonishing ability to be incredibly endearing and totally irritating at the same time.
Cats are king, and they are everywhere. I am told that there are 38 species of felids  meaning feline species - ranging from the seven-pound domestic tabby in your lap to 500-pound Siberian tigers  with cheetahs, leopards, ocelots and other large striped and spotted predators in between.
Some of these felines express what I have phrased cat-titude, which is not just attitude with cat spliced in. No, no, no. It is a whole separate idea. Many with cat-titude might try to act unimpressed with your attempts to pamper them. They may swat at you whenever you try to hand them things, scratch the door whenever they want to go outside, or suddenly sit on your laptop while youre using it, without explanation.
The first real cat-fancier I encountered was my former journalist colleague, Neville de Silva, who was crazy about them. But then it must be said that he was a lover of all kinds of animals furry or the feathered kind. He was so paw-sitively concerned when the office cat in the Daily News editorial had littered. He brought in a bowl and instructed the peons to have it filled with warm milk from the cafeteria for the nursing mother.
When the kittens were weaned he would place them in the pockets of his safari suit  they were in vogue then, you know, those big Bwana game-hunter outfits. He would saunter around the office making casual conversation while the kits peered out curiously at the journalistic world of what punsters called the Daily Mews around them. Actually the furry little things must have felt like the cats whiskers and not what the office cat brought in.
Talk about being smitten by a kitten, or a whole fluffy bunch of them! Now Neville did manage to give away his entire menagerie of kittens for adoption among his colleagues. Just think about this argument he would use as a sales pitch: Why do we still use the phrase puppy dog eyes when kitten eyes are much more persuasive Kittens have a certain innocence about them that make them incredibly convincing. One look at them and guys like Neville would give them anything they want. Neville too was possessed with the similar power of purr-suasion. That is obviously why he was handpicked in later life to serve his country as a high-ranking diplomat.
He managed to gift the quintuplet litter of kitties and carried the last of the furry felines over to my wife Thelmas desk and convinced her to adopt him. They named her Inky for her black spots on a white fur-lined backdrop. Months later Thelma wrote a piece about Inky which was headlined: Inky  a newspaper cat!
No one in his right mind could refute that Neville was the cats pyjamas when it came to feline devotion. Even the mature mousers could never resist Nevilles presence. During liquid lunch breaks a colony of Lake House journos would frequent the varied pubs in the Fort. Among the more popular of these watering holes was the Lord Nelson pub located at Chatham Street. The Lord Nelson was a spacious pub and could accommodate some 150 patrons at a lunch time sitting.
Whenever Neville strode into the Lord Nelson, he was greeted like a conquering hero by the overgrown pub tomcat. Before he could settle comfortably in his chair there was pandemonium all round. One synonym for athletic that the dictionary neglects to mention is cathletic - an astounding agility the pub tom displayed when he spotted his favourite patron. A large gray, furry streak scuttled between the legs of tipplers with the velocity of a panther and plunked itself squarely in Nevilles lap. It was more than simply an emotional bond between cat and man because Neville never failed to order an extra plate of fish sausages for the adoring Tom.
Inky was a great mouse-keteer and defied the fierce Alsatian Pasha with slashes of his scimitar-like claws. A year later he had grown into a heavy-set tom who began romancing the female felines and was suspected of contributing generously to the neighbourhoods kitty population explosion. A year later we had to leave the country as I had to take up an appointment in Malaysia.
The retainers informed us that Inky had refused to enter the house since the day we left. He had become a maverick and only returned to take his meals outside the kitchen door. A year or two later when we returned on holiday Inky leaped off the roof and made a bee-line for Thelma. He snuggled up to her and nipped her finger in what must have been some sort of remonstration for abandoning him.
In later years a cute marmalade she cat appeared on our driveway seemingly from nowhere and fell at Thelmas feet in a rare gesture of reverential devotion. Marmalade as she was christened, we called her Marmie for short, sported deep reddish orange splotches interspersed with black and white. She was the most colourful tabby we had ever encountered.
As with Nevilles charges she clawed her way into the hearts of the household and wouldnt let go. Marmie could purr her way out of anything. She was above all a dramatist and flatterer. She had other fine qualities as well. She also demonstrated that she was quite a loveable character and a connoisseur of comfort. That was proof, if any more were needed, of the marmalade cats talismanic superiority.
I subscribe to the theory that cats especially female cats are sexually promiscuous creatures. And Marmie proved that assumption convincingly. Whenever she came into heat she called out to let the toms know that she was ready for romantic interludes. She also paired frequently and often with different males that had fought each other to win mating rights. Her resulting litter of kittens had obviously been sired by different males which accounted for littermates that looked surprisingly different from one another.
Many of her suitors were meow-sicians with cultivated tenors whose caterwauling clashed with her soprano screeches. She was also fiercely proud and would stalk out of the home when reprimanded. But would always return when she was about to unload her litter. We finally had her spayed because she had appropriated the divine injunction to increase and multiply. And the result was always a supply beyond any rational demand.
And finally we became the catspaws in a cat culture that left us in a catatonic state.

Bangladesh Film Festival 2018
The Bangladesh High Commission in Sri Lanka together with the National Film Corporation will hold a Bangladesh Film Festival from March 23 to 25 at the NFC film hall. Six exceptional films which have won global acclaim will be showcased at the event. Entrance free.
The cinema of Bangladesh comes from the Bengali language-based film industry, and revolves around Dhaka (Bangladesh). It has been a significant industry since the early 1970s. The industry is frequently referred to as "Dhallywood" - a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. The dominant style of Bangladeshi cinema is melodramatic cinema, which developed from 1947 to 1990 and characterizes most feature films to date.
Cinema was introduced in present-day Bangladesh in 1898 by Bradford Bioscope Company - credited to have arranged the first film release in Bangladesh. During 191314, the first production company i.e. Picture House was opened. A short, silent film Sukumari (The Good Girl) was the first film produced in the region (1928). Then followed the first full-length film - The Last Kiss (released in 1931). In 1956, The Face and the Mask was produced  as the first Bengali language Bangladeshi full-length feature film.
Throughout the 1960s, 70s, 80s and the first half of the 90s, the Bangladeshi film industry witnessed its golden period. Many successful films were produced. Some of the films are still adored beyond borders. Directors like Fateh Lohani, Zahir Raihan, Alamgir Kabir, Khan Ataur Rahman, Subhash Dutta, Ritwik Ghatak, Ehtesham, Chashi Nazrul Islam, Abdullah al Mamun, Sheikh Niamat Ali, Gazi Mazharul Anwar, Tanvir Mokammel, Tareque Masud, Morshedul Islam et al made significant contributions to Bangladeshi mainstream cinema, parallel cinema, art films and won global acclaim.

AG on Amendments to Judicature Act
Bill not to set up new courts
Expressing views regarding the proposed amendments to the Judicature Act, the Attorney General yesterday informed the Supreme Court that the proposed Bill is not to establish a new High Court but to have certain court rooms having Benches of three judges of the High Court to only hear complex financial and economic crime cases expeditiously.
Senior Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing on behalf of the Attorney General made this remarks when the hearing pertaining to seven Special Determination petitions challenging the constitutionality of the bill entitled the Judicature (Amendment), a Bill to amend the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 were taken up before a Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Nalin Perera.
He further said it is in the interest of the country that such complex financial crime cases be heard and concluded expeditiously.
The SASG said reference to the permanent High Court-at-Bar will be amended during the committee stage.
It would become clear that the reference to the term permanent High Court-at-Bar will not be reference to creation of a new High Court. It would only be High Courts of Republic which will have a Bench of three judges which will only hear the cases in terms of the proposed amendment to the Judicature Act, the SASG added.
The proper administration of criminal justice with regard to complex finance and economic crimes required a considerable judicial experience for proper dispensation of criminal justice as well as collective judicial consideration.
Through this provisions not a single judge of a High Court will decide but a three-Judge-Bench of the High Court will collectively consider, he further added.
Mr. Kodagoda said particularly, complex financial and economic crimes are a threat to governance. There can be a macro economic impact on the economy of the country as we observed during last two years with regard to Treasury Bonds. It is in the interest of the country that such complex cases be heard and concluded expeditiously, he further added.
SASG Kodagoda further said both the Attorney General and the Director General of the Bribery Commission already have prosecutorial discretion with regard to the court in which proceedings ought to be heard.
However, in his Special Determination petition, MP Dinesh Gunawardena had alleged that it would indirectly empower the Attorney General and the Director General for the Prevention of Bribery and Corruption to use the findings of the investigations carried out by police. At present, the Chief Justice appoints three High Court judges who are currently presiding in three different High Courts and called upon them and empanel themselves as separate bench of High Court and hear this one trial at Bar on a day-to-day basis. So we have separate forms of High Court judges decided not by the executive but identified by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) on complex nature of the Financial and Economic crime cases, Mr. Kodagoda said.
Meanwhile, the SASG rejected a statement given by former Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to the media alleging that the Attorney General had given a 19 pages opinion that the new laws to set up High Courts are unconstitutional. Mr. Kodagoda produced in Court a file maintained by the Attorney General showing that what was ruled by the Attorney General was not in connectgon with this bill but the bill prepared to establish a tribunal outside the judiciary.
Seven Special Determination petitions challenging the constitutionality of the bill entitled the Judicature (Amendment), a bill to amend the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 was yesterday fixed for further argument today (20) by the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, 13 parties including Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva had filed intervention petitions in support of this bill and the oral submissions on behalf of these intervention petitioners are to be made today.
Seven Special Determination petitions had been filed by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman G.L. Peiris, Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardene, BASL President U.R. de Silva and four others. They stated that the concerned bill would vest in the executive with arbitrary powers to decide as to whom to be tried before the proposed High Court and thereby deprive the citizens of equal application of the Criminal Procedure, which is essential for the upholding of the Rule of Law.
In their intervention petitions Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, State Minister Eran Wickramaratne, Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavitharana, State Minister Ajith P. Perera, Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, Saman Rathnapriya, Jayadeva Uyangoda, Attorney-at-Law K.W. Janaranjana, Gamini Viyangoda and Jagath Premachandra sought the Courts intervention to make their submissions.
They also sought a declaration that the bill shall not become law through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The intervention petitioners further said the clauses of the said bill are not in violation of and inconsistent with Articles 3, 4(a), (b) (c), 12(1), 12(2), 13(3),14, 14(1)(g) 27, 75, 83 and 84(2) and the other Articles of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, Gamini Marapana PC, Sanjeewa Jayawardena PC, Manohara de Silva PC and Kushan de Alwis PC appeared on behalf of the petitioners.
Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna, Dr. Jayampathi Wickremaratne PC, Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC and Saliya Peiris PC appeared for the intervention petitioners.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC with Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana PC appeared for the Attorney General.

Captures real-life suspense
Taut with anxiety, 7 Days in Entebbe is a powerful example of how dramatizing a well-recorded chapter of history can still generate hard-hitting suspense.
On June 27, 1976, a plane carrying 248 passengers and 12 crew members from Tel Aviv to Paris was seized by four armed hijackers  two left-wing German revolutionaries and two Palestinians. The flight eventually ended up in Uganda, where the hostages were held in a decrepit abandoned airport. Their lives became points of leverage as their armed captors demand that Israel free jailed Palestinian militants was rejected, and the divided Israeli government debated how to pull off a seemingly impossible commando mission to rescue them.
The film re-creates the ticking-clock crisis in tones that are serious, but not too solemn to deliver well-timed thrills. Quickly backgrounding viewers unfamiliar with the origins of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, the film moves to the capture of Air France Flight 139 almost before the passengers have loosened their seat belts.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 20:The Five practices of exemplary leadership
Leadership does not just happen. Leaders are made, not born. Leadership is a set of skills and abilities that anyone can learn. Some may take a little more time than others. That is the only difference. Those skills can be strengthened, honed, and enhanced.
No one has said leadership is easy, but the rewards are great! In making the commitment to be a role model for our groups, to look positively at the future, to encourage our team members to be the best that they can be and then thank them for their efforts, we are fostering not only their development as leaders, but our own, while positively moving our team into the future.
In the past few weeks we have discussed the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership which can make better leaders of us all. To recap, the Five Practices are:
1. Model the Way
2. Inspire a Shared Vision
3. Challenge the Process
4. Enable Others to Act
5. Encourage the Heart
Leaders who use these practices create higher-performing teams, increase sales and customer satisfaction levels, and foster renewed loyalty and greater organizational commitment.
We also considered each of the four attributes that compel people to follow a leader, including that the leader be honest, forward-looking, inspiring and competent. People who work with such leaders are significantly more satisfied, committed, energized, and productive.
Ten commitments
Today, we will begin exploring each of the 10 commitments of leadership. the commitments mapped to the practices:
These ten commitments are:
* Search out challenging opportunities to change, grow, innovate, and improve. (for Practice 1)
* Experiment, take risks, and learn from mistakes. (for Practice 1)
* Envision an uplifting and enabling future. (for Practice 2)
* Enlist others in a common vision by appealing to their interests, hopes, and dreams. (for Practice 2)
* Foster collaboration by promoting cooperative goals and building trust. (for Practice 3)
* Strengthen people by giving power away, providing choice, developing competence,
assigning critical tasks, and offering visible support (for Practice 3)
* Set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with shared values. (for Practice 4)
* Achieve small wins that promote consistent progress and build commitment. (for Practice 4)
* Recognize individual contributions to the success of every effort. (for Practice 5)
* Celebrate team accomplishments regularly. (for Practice 5)
If you want to make a significant impact on people, on communities, and on organizations, you can do so by making the most important commitment: the commitment to become the very best leader you can be.
Let us go through these Ten Leadership Commitments this week and next week.
Search out challenging opportunities 
Leaders venture out. Those who lead others to greatness seek and accept challenge. Every single personal-best leadership case we collected involved some kind of challenge. Not one person said he or she achieved a personal best by keeping things the same.
The work of leaders is change, and the status quo is unacceptable to them. They search for opportunities to innovate, grow, and improve. But leaders need not always be the creators or originators. In fact, its just as likely that theyre not.
Sometimes a dramatic external event thrusts an organization into a radically new condition. Therefore, leaders must remain open to receiving ideas from anyone and anywhere. The leaders primary contribution is in recognizing and supporting good ideas and in being willing to challenge the system to get new products, processes, services, and systems adopted.
Leaders are early supporters and adopters of innovation. Leaders know well that innovation and challenge involve experimentation, risk, and even failure. Experiments dont always work out as planned. People often make mistakes when they try something new.
Instead of trying to fix blame for mistakes, leaders learn from them and encourage others to do the same. Leaders understand that the key that unlocks the door to opportunity is learning, especially in the face of obstacles. As weather shapes mountains, problems shape leaders. Leaders are learners.
Experiment, take risks, and learn from mistakes
In these highly competitive and fast-moving times pushing the boundaries  personal, team, and organization  is not an option, but a necessity. Leaders who want to achieve success understand that taking risk is an essential part of achieving results. Leaders must discover their risk tolerance by stepping-out of the comfort zone and engage with these four things in mind:
* Do not let limited thinking stop you.
* Focus on the outcome and the rewards.
* Learn from mistakes.
Recognize that success and failure are connected and are necessary for growth.But, lets be clear: Risk taking by itself without understanding the nuances of the challenge is reckless, and it will doom any project to failure. Finding the creative edges is both art and science. The best leaders have figured out how to do that. With that in mind, let me give you, a five-step process to help you as a leader as you step out of your comfort zone:
Step One: Listen to your intuition
First, there is no perfection in risk taking. It really is a gut reaction, an instinct if you will. Allow yourself the pleasure of following it. Quite often people overthink things; they come up with reasons not to and only end up coming back to their first thought anyway. Believe in that first thought. Listen carefully to it, and dont be afraid to follow it  nine times out of ten, it will prove to be worth-while.
Step Two: Be careful of analysis paralysis
Great leaders dont become great by being predictable and playing it safe. There is merit in being consistent, and all risks should have some level of consideration  but, dont over-analyse. People can talk themselves out of anything and in risk taking you cant let yourself get paralyzed in the details. It might never be the perfect time, with the perfect set of circumstances, but at some point, you just have to do it. Take the risk, make the move. People will respect you for it.
Step Three: Dont let What you think you know guide all of your actions
We are all creatures of habit - to some extent - but also have minds like sponges. As professionals, we need to be open to learning, exploring and not believing that we have all of the answers. Because, lets be honest, we never really do. Its important to realize that the world is changing - and its changing quickly. Sometimes what worked before will never work again. The best thing we can do as a professional is be open to exploring the new options that come our way and implement a trial-and-error mentality.
Step Four: Try starting with baby steps
If risks arent for you, try them in small doses. Try a pilot or test before taking the big leap. This method will allow you to see the outcome before the impact is too grand.
Step Five: Be ready to make mistakes
Youll find out that with risk taking you wont win every time. Be sure to minimize the fallout whenever possible and plan to re-execute with necessary changes should a risk not pan out. They are called risks for a reason, but dont be afraid to make a mistake. Mistakes are the best way people learn and develop into the best kind of professionals.
In summary, risks are all about encouraging your own development into the best person and professional you can be. If the word risk is too strong a word, try instead thinking outside the box or being innovative.
Envision an uplifting and enabling future.
Having foresight and considering the points mentioned will allow you to envision the future of your organization. By envisioning your future and communicating these plans to your team, you will be significantly ahead of most of your competitors. Keep in mind, a vision and strategic plan is not just a set of numbers. For example, a spreadsheet with sales and profit numbers is not a strategic plan.
You need a detailed plan on how you are going to get there. This should include goals, actions, due dates and responsibilities. You should also be sure that part of this future vision includes what skills or types of people you need your team to grow into. Then, get help from the outside to develop your human capital.
You also need to consider if the future will require any changes in your corporate culture. A culture is like a strong gravitational force - extremely hard to overcome. It will take work and often help from the outside. Any culture shift will require a charismatic and experienced team made up of both internal and external representatives. Don't minimize the challenge in changing cultures - most executives fail doing so. Even though what you are doing may be good for the company, possibly saving it, we are all human, and change is tough.
When we get stressed, most of us want to go back to the familiar. This will include your managers and your employees. Don't forget, people respond better when you tell them why and when they feel ownership.
Yes, planning for the future is challenging, but providing foresight is one of the most important aspects of what senior executives do for an organization. Ensure you are spending enough time to envision your companys future and make it a continuous process. Foresight requires analytical and creative thinking, and it requires experience.
Although we cannot predict the future precisely, we can envision scenarios and plan for the future. Remember, failing to plan is planning to fail.
(Other commitments to be continued next week)

Del Potro outlasts Federer to win Indian Wells final
INDIAN WELLS, Monday  Former US Open champion Juan Martin Del Potro stunned top-ranked Roger Federer 6-4, 6-7 (8/10), 7-6 (7/2) Sunday to win his first Indian Wells title and second consecutive ATP crown.
The 29-year-old from Argentina handed Federer his first match defeat of 2018 and extended his own win streak to 11 matches, including a title run earlier this month at Acapulco.
"I'm still shaking," Del Potro said. "It's difficult to describe with words. It's like a dream."
Del Potro, nagged by wrist injuries throughout his career, survived three match points before claiming the championship in a third-set tie-breaker, ending a two hour, 42 minute marathon contest.
"I cannot believe I won this tournament, beating Roger in a great final and this level of tennis. We played great tennis today," Del Potro said.
"I just want to keep winning titles like this if I can."
Del Potro won the first five points of the deciding tie-breaker then closed it out when Swiss superstar Federer, who had won a career-best 17 straight matches to start the year, smacked a forehand long.
It was an emotional match for both players as each took turns questioning the chair umpire. Del Potro urged him to stop the pro-Federer crowd from making noise on his serve and an irritated Federer also had a couple of lively conversations with the umpire.
"I don't remember half of it," said Federer. "I was trying to pump myself up more, get energy for me. It had no effect on the outcome."
Del Potro was competing in his first Indian Wells final since 2013, when he lost to Spaniard Rafael Nadal.
It was Del Potro's seventh victory over Federer in 25 career meetings, one of those wins coming in the 2009 US Open final.
"I always play good against him. I won a couple of finals and lost a couple of finals. In the end I was lucky to win. We played great tennis today," Del Potro said.
World number eight Del Potro is back in the rankings top 10 after dropping to 1,045th before beginning his comeback from three left wrist surgeries in 2016.
"I am excited to see what is next," he said. "I am still surprising myself and I want to keep surprising the tennis tour," Del Potro said.
Federer blasted 10 aces but had five double faults and his serve was broken twice.
He said it is going to take a little longer than normal to get over this one.
"It should sting," Federer said. "The question is how long It is disappointing talking about a great match like this and losing.
"You move on. There's no time to dwell over it. I see the positives at the end of the day."
Federer survived a match point in the second set tiebreaker to force the third. "It was a lot of chances at either end," he said.
"He should have maybe closed it first in the second set I believe. Even early in the second set I think he had break point chances.
"But I was able to find my game and get out of that game."
In the 10th game of the third set Federer returned the favour with three match points of his own but Del Potro timed his forehand shots perfectly.
"It was disappointing," Federer said. "Juan Martin was a bit better at the end. It was maybe a point here or there, maybe a shot, maybe a forehand, maybe a chip."
Federer, the oldest world number one in ATP history at 36, entered the final having dropped just one set, in a difficult semi-final test from Croatia's Borna Coric.
Federer's five Indian Wells titles included last year, when he beat fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka.  AFP

The Drums of War..!
Dont mistake those sounds for war! They beat, a slow, steady beat to get into your head, and in there reverberate, resonate, resound and ring crazily, creating what the drummer wants to convey. Were going to war! Were going to war! beat the drums, first far away as diplomats are pulled out of country, then closer, as stray gunshots are fired across borders and retaliatory ones fired back. The drum beats get closer, louder, and frenzied sounds dance through our minds, first with concern, then anger, finally fists of hate!
All this through the drums of war, clever drummer beats to them!
I walk to the drummer, and ask, Drummer boy, why beat them drums
Because its a beat, people will rise to! smirks the drummer, When all else fails, the drumbeats of war incense, inflame and infuriate!
What failed oh drummer I ask even as drumbeats crash violently in my ear.
I tried the kettle drum of communalism! says the drummer, disappointment writ in his eyes, And though those beats helped me win at election time, they became sounds, people stopped listening to as days went by!
And then twas these drums you started on I ask.
No! says the drummer as his eyes with anger fill, I then played the bongos! Its sounds are fast paced and again people heard its steady rhythmic beat of terror, and with that beat, they pictured a terrorist in their neighbor, beheld terrorism in other forms of worship, felt terrified with those who looked different, and those bongo beats created the violence I desired, as people clung to me!
You were their leader through the terror beat of those drums I whisper aghast.
Till the incessant beat made them immune, and though I cried out, my fingers hurt playing for them, they turned away to hear the strains of peace from violin sound!
Ah the ancient fiddle! I exclaim, melodies which, calm the brutal, savage streaks in us!
And, like pied piper, those men of peace drew my followers away, till with frenzy, and anger I turned and saw seductively looking at me, these Drums of War that had only one line written on them, Use me and get your people back!
I see blonde haired leader from across the seas and white beard nearby play the Drums of War. I will soon hear people screaming at the borders, sabres rattling and generals flexing their muscled tongues.
You fools! I cry, Do you know what a nuclear war can do to us but my voice doesnt carry above the maniacal, maddening mayhem of the war beat, beaten to a frenzy by drummers who have tried all else and now resort to the drums of war!
Close thine ears to those beats oh ye people, and listen instead to the soft strains of calm that play ever so gently; soft, smooth and soothing from yonder fiddlers of peace..!

Emirates SkyCargo awarded Cargo iQ certification through external audit
Emirates SkyCargo, the freight division of Emirates, was presented with its Cargo iQ certification at the World Cargo Symposium in Dallas, Texas, USA.
SGS, Cargo iQs nominated external audit company, audited Emirates SkyCargos internal processes including the measures taken by the carrier to minimize or eliminate shipment errors and provide customers with more visibility on the status of their shipments.
Emirates SkyCargo became a member of Cargo iQ in 2016 to further reinforce its service standards including its Delivered as Promised commitment. In less than two years, Emirates SkyCargo has integrated Cargo iQ shipment cycle management standards as the basis for its live shipment planning and tracking of cargo.
With every Cargo iQ member that becomes accredited, we are another step towards a supply chain that is transparent and in control of its shipments, said Ariaen Zimmerman, Executive Director, Cargo iQ.
The way Emirates SkyCargo has integrated the Cargo iQ Master Operating Plan with their internal procedures is a clear example of how implementing our standards offers so much more than a mere monthly report, and can actually lead to better process and shipment control.
Emirates SkyCargo has invested in setting up and operating a dedicated Cargo Operations Control Centre (COCC) which monitors the status of shipments in real time.
The COCC uses live shipment data and Cargo iQ metrics to track the progress of the shipments journey against its route map and the delivery commitment created at the time of booking.
Alerts are automatically generated when there is a deviation in milestones along the route map, allowing the COCC to intervene proactively and in real time, and take corrective measures at any point from origin to destination.
The COCC is operational 24/7, continuously monitoring shipments across Emirates SkyCargos global network of over 155 destinations.
Over the last two years we have worked on integrating the vision of Cargo iQ into our processes and our Delivered as Promised commitment to our customers, said Nabil Sultan, Emirates Divisional Senior Vice President, Cargo.
Getting the Cargo iQ certification and the setting up of our 24/7 Cargo Operations Control Centre are the first steps in a journey where we can be more transparent and at the same time more proactively support our customer promises.
The Cargo iQRoutemap is integrated into the framework of the COCC, ensuring that the service promise and journey updates are exchanged between Emirates SkyCargo and the customer, improving transparency and allowing customers to effectively plan their logistics value chain.
Unique to the air cargo industry, Cargo iQ brings together over 80 stakeholders from all aspects of the air cargo supply chain including airlines, forwarders, ground handling agents, technology providers, and airports to collaborate on developing and implementing service standards in the air cargo industry.

Fashion  statement  for every bride

Hiru Colombo Bridal week 2018 will be held in Colombo this month attracting several international and local bodies in the fashion industry. Bridal week is an internationally prestigious identity event for bridal and fashion industry. The event always takes the name of the main city of the country where it is held and as a result gains fame across the country and all over the world. Colombo being the main trading city of the country, will be the venue for this mega event. 
Twenty countries around the world hold the bridal week. We decided to have bridal week in Colombo to show the rest of the world that the country is in par with the international fashion industry. We are expecting renowned designers from many countries, GIDA International Director, Gihan Dassanayake said.
The event will take place as a five day exhibition featuring three bridal shows. Hiru Colombo Bridal week will be held from March 21 to 25 at various venues. The inaugural event will take place on March 21 at 10am while the bridal shows will be held on March 23, 24 and 25. Sri Lankan and International bridal shows will be held at the Dutch Hospital before the grand finale at Nelum Pokuna on March 26. We hope to make this event the biggest in South Asia while elevating the standards of Lankan fashion designers, Dassanayake explained.
He added that the event will attract several international brands to Sri Lanka positioning the country before India, the highly competitive market in the region.
Parallel to the bridal show, National Gem and Jewellery Authority will hold a gem exhibition and an auction for Blue Sapphires. The first ever auction for sapphires will be held on March 24 at 3.30pm at Gem and Jewellery exchange, World Trade Centre Colombo.
National Gem and Jewellery Authority has realized that the jewellery sector has been neglected. A gem finally ends up in a jewel so this time we have joined hands with Colombo bridal week to open this market for local buyers. Sri Lanka known as the Sapphire Capital has over the years undisputedly accepted as the premier source of precious coloured stones. There is a huge demand for Lankan gems. With the first auction of sapphires we hope to attract both international and local buyers, National Gem and Jewellery Authority Chairman/CEO, D. M. D. O. K. Dissanayake said.
The gemologists at the World Trade Center Gem and Jewellery exchanged pointed out that Lankan gems should be promoted more to develop the industry. When locals need a precious stones for jewellery or astrological purposes they do not know where to go. Here at the exchange we have 38 shops and a modern gem testing laboratory. We have the authenticity and we provide the meeting place for overseas buyers. Through this exhibition and auction we hope to open up the avenues for local buyers to reach us for their needs for gem and other precious stones, President of the exchange, W. U. P. De Alwis said.

Fitch affirms HNB Assurance and HNB General Insurance ratings
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Sri Lanka-based HNB Assurance PLCs (HNBA) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating and National Long-Term Rating of A(lka).
Fitch has also affirmed its 100% owned subsidiary HNB General Insurance Limiteds (HNBGI) National IFS Rating and National Long-Term Rating at A(lka). The Outlook on the ratings is Stable.
The ratings reflect the insurance groups strong capitalisation, strong domestic business profile, good financial performance and earnings as well as prudent investment policy.
We see HNBA, a life operator, and its non-life subsidiary, HNBGI, as having strong domestic business profiles, supported by association with the groups parent, Hatton National Bank PLC (HNB, AA-(lka)/Stable), with whom the insurance group shares the HNB brand name. The ratings also reflect synergies gained from using the wider branch network of HNB as well as the insurance groups importance to the bank in providing bancassurance products and HNBs 60% stake in the insurance group.
The agency expects the capitalisation of HNBA and HNBGI to remain satisfactorily above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital (RBC) ratio of 120%. HNBAs RBC ratio was 358% at end-2017, while HNBGIs was 178%. Management expects to maintain HNBAs RBC ratio at over 300% and HNBGIs at over 170% in the medium term.
Changes in the Inland Revenue Act, which come into effect from April 1, 2018, are likely to lower HNBAs profitability, as its life operations will be liable to pay an effective 28% tax rate on its life business surplus.

Gliricidia averts denudation of Rajawaka forest
Rajawaka forest, 15 km east of Balangoda town in the Ratnapura district, which is rich in medicinal herbs and other valuable plants and trees, is being denuded by farmers from surrounding villages. This has been a problem for nearly two decades.
Farmers needing sticks to support their young vegetable plants used to gather them by cutting down plants such as gammalu, pihibiya, duhundu, sudu handun, and wedanghu in the forest. However, a project to supply gliricidia to these farmers has successfully eliminated this problem of denudation of the forest.
Farmers in the remote villages of Tanjantenna, Kuragala, Watawala, Mulgama, Molamure, Teladiriya, Godakumbura and Mahawalatenna grow vegetables and breed cattle as a means of livelihood. Most of them plant bean and tomato because they have been effective and profitable crops. Each young plant needs a stick to support growth. As these sticks are not amply available in their home gardens, the farmers used to cut down young trees in the nearby Rajawaka forest.
Sabaragamuwa Civil Development Foundation President Palitha Karunaratna said that although they were arrested and fined, the farmers used to continue their practice of felling trees in the forest. Studies revealed that annually five million plants were cut down in this manner.
We grouped 140 farmers in two grama niladari divisions - Kuragala and Tanjantenna - and made them aware of the harm they were causing to the forest. We also gave them gliricidia to plant, so that they could use these sticks for their crops instead of denuding the forest. This project has been successful.
Farmer A. M. Premadasa who now plants gliricidia, said, The Sabaragamuwa Civil Development Foundation made us aware of the damage we were causing to nature. Through the Foundation, each farmer was supplied with 2,000 gliricidia saplings. Now in every home garden, gliricidia is flourishing. It is a multipurpose crop which can be used for fodder, organic manure, firewood, and even for energy generation. We are also able to sell the surplus in the market for Rs. 4 a stick.
G. M. Piyaseeli said, In the past, we had no knowledge about the importance of the environment. It is through the Foundation that we have been made aware of the damage we have caused to the environment. The gliricidia plant which was introduced to us is of great value in many ways. Our pepper plantation has adjusted well to this tree. We have taken steps to reuse one stick for two seasons. We no longer invade the forest around our village.
I.W. A. Upasena said, I have cattle as well as vegetable plots. Within a short period after planting gliricidia, it was possible to obtain two or three sticks. Later on, the number grows. I use the foliage as fodder and the excess sticks are sold to collection centres. If we propagate this plant in other areas, it would ultimately lead the way to installing a power generation plant.

God given voice
Jean Vanheer has had so many girls telling her that they want to be like her. Vanheer says she is a largely self-taught singer and is now doing what she loves best which is playing Jazz. Melodies features Vanheer who says she will sing today and in the life to come.
There are so many who want to sing like me. Some girls have even told me how much they want to be like me. So they listen to me. Because I think it is a god given talent. Everyone says it is a god given voice when they listen to me. I have a lot of fans who come just to listen to me. They all recognize me for what I have. I am enjoying my life now because my goals are simple  I just want to continue what I do best and that is singing till the day I die, said Vanheer.
Jean Vanheer
Vanheer did pop for nearly 25 years, and then after that went into Jazz because that was her liking. From her youth she loved Jazz. When she was eight years old, her mother allowed her to take part in some talent shows.
I really admire singers like Nat King Cole and Ella Fitzgerald. So now for 15 years I have been doing Jazz. I lost my husband very early, so singing was my bread and butter to take care of my kids and my passion. My children are now married and settled down. So now I am doing it purely for pleasure and my husband Rodney Vanheer. We are working for ourselves and we are happy doing Jazz. I represented Sri Lanka in India for a jazz event seven years ago. I have been awarded three times in recognition of my talent, stated Vanheer
Vanheer has never tried to be someone she is not. She is not a copy of other singers. She has her own identity. She tries to innovate and put something very original out.
I have a great love for singing. It is something that is indescribable. I have never copied any singer. However I listen to them and take the basics and I always change it and try to do my own thing the way I feel. Even when I was a little girl I was always singing. My first experience with senior musicians was with Jimmy Manuel, Joy Ferdinands & Clement Kumaravel, added Vanheer.
Singing is her life and she has steered her own ship. She made it on her own steam even though her uncle gently introduced her to the vocation. She started her music career when she was already married and had children
Singing is my life. Because I am largely a self-taught person. I just sing from my heart. I have not gone for voice training. I have only gone for competitions winning many. It was my uncle who always told me that I had a voice and I could sing well. Then in 1965 Mr. Malcom Andree asked me to sing at his shows at the Kandy Lake Club. I used to sing there once a week, said Vanheer.
The next step was S.L.B.C. for voice grading. She was given all- star grade, and was given a regular 15 minute program called "In Concert Style".
It was then that my career started to rise. Those days the industry was very selective. They looked to see if you were a very qualified person who had gone through these voice grading. Then they took you.
My next performance was with the "Patrick Nelson Combo". The line- up was Patrick Nelson (Piano), Bella Karekase (Saxophone and Trombone), Nasen Manikawasager (Bass), Melroy Passe Silva (Guitar) and Farook Miskin (Drums) and myself.
I was with them for six years at the Mount Lavinia Hotel at the Little Hut. In time they went abroad but I could not leave my children and go. So then I was called by Mr. Gazali Amit to sing at the Blue Leopard. Then the line-up was Gazali Amit (Guitar), Jimmy Manuel (Piano), Valentine Manikawasager (Bass Guitar), Rodney Vanheer (Saxophone), Clifford Foenander (Drums) and myself. There I went on for another six years.
Then Rodney and I formed our own band and we called it Rage. Then we started playing on our own at the Leopard. Then we got an offer at the Pegasus Reef Hotel. There we were for another six years going as Rage.
It was then that I went overseas and was out for two or three years. Unfortunately I met with an accident and broke my leg. And for a year I was doing nothing. Then I started singing again at the Mount Lavinia Hotel along with Kuma De Silva and Hans Mater. So we started a three piece. That went on for a year or two.
The present five piece band comprises of Kuma De Silva (Piano), Dulip Gnanakan (Bass), Shiraaz NoorAmith (Drums), Rodney Vanheer (Saxophone) and myself, explained Vanheer.

Hambantota elephant - human conflict aggravated
The elephant - human conflict has aggravated in the Hambantota district during the last week costing two human lives in Sooriyawewa and causing damage to nearly 10 houses by rampaging elephants. According to Wildlife officials, the main cause for this is large scale clearing of jungle land and improper human activity.
Among the villages threatened by wild elephants are Weliara, Bandagiriya, Samarakoon wewa, Katuwewa, Kude Welpokuna, Tammennawa, Uthpala, Walsapugala, Andarawewa, Joolwewa, Elalla, Kadjuwagawa, Mattala, Kuda Indiwewa, Bogahaidiwewa, Karametiya, Mahagalwewa, Aluthgamara, Suruwinigama, Konketiara, Wewegama, Namadagaswewa, Madunagala, Seenimodarayaya, Hasthipura, Atekanuwa, Andigama, Mahaara, Talalla, Koggalla, Habarattawela, Unudiya Pokuna and Mahapelessa. People allege that Wildlife officials fail to drive away the rampaging elephants before they cause immense damage to their food crops.
Meanwhile, Wildlife officials said that they receive nearly 50 complaints a day regarding rampaging elephants but they could not attend to them at once due to lack of staff and other equipment.
It was natural for elephants to invade villages when they are restricted to a small strip of jungle land as a result of on going development projects such as the Matara-Mattala Expressway.
They have a major burden on their lands because they had to protect both human and elephant lives during this exercise.

India and Bangladesh meeting next month on transit protocol
KOLKATA: The proposed high-level meeting on the Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWTT) between India and Bangladesh next month is expected to finalise its Standard Operating Procedures (SoP), an official said. 
Once the PIWTT SoP is in place, inland waterways will boost trade to the north eastern states and Bangladesh from Kolkata, he said. 
"A meeting is expected next month. There is no hurdle as such. A standard operating procedure has to be finalised and the meeting will try to complete that," Inland Waterways Authority of India Vice-chairman Pravir Pandey told . 
The two countries had agreed on the extension of Protocol on Inland Water Transit and Trade (PIWTT), which was signed in 1972. 
The National Waterway one (NW -1) will connect the North East through Indo-Bangla protocol route. It will reduce the distance from about 1,700 km via Siliguri in north Bengal to about 500 km via Bangladesh, he said. 
The route will also open up opportunity for Bangladesh trade through Haldia port and lessen congestion at Chittagong port in Bangladesh. 
In the protocol route, Rs 3,500 crore dredging project has been undertaken and the cost will be shared at 80:20 between India and Bangladesh. 
In the protocol route, dredging would be required mainly in some stretches under Sirajganj to Doikhawa route on Brahmaputra-Jamuna river in Bangladesh and also under Ashuganj to Karimganj to improve the navigability, Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority s Director (Marine safety and Traffic management) Md Shafiqul Haque had said earlier. 
India is developing the NW-1 under the Jal Marg Vikas Project with assistance from the World Bank. The estimated project cost has been revised upward to Rs 5,369 crore from the initial estimation of Rs 4,200 crore, he said. (www.economictimes.com)

Island-wide peace stressed at Akkaraipattu Traders Association meeting
Sri Lanka is a beautiful country where all three communities are living with peace and harmony with all due respects and honour. At this juncture the untoward incidents that took place in Ampara, Digana and other Muslim places in the Kandy District are very unfortunate and tarnished the image of Sri Lanka in the International world, Brigade Commander of 241 Brigade at Akkraipattu Colonel Wipula W. Chandrasiri said.
Every peace loving citizen of Sri Lanka should be ashamed of these adverse incidents and we all should see that any violence of this nature should never happen in the future with a determined assurance on this vital aspect. I am very much unhappy over this incident and apologize for what had happened in Ampara, he said.
He was addressing a Traders Association meeting held at the Akkaraipattu Mango Garden presided over by Akkaraipattu Peace Foundation President Dr. S. M. A. Jabbar on Friday, March 16.
The meeting was organized by the Peace Foundation with the view to accelerate the activities of Traders Association which was in a state of defunct and intended to re-organize with new officials with innovative trends. This meeting was attended by a good number of Traders of Akkaraipattu engaged in all types of business.
Peace Foundation President Dr. Jabbar in his inaugural address detailed the purpose of the meeting and why it was convened. He said that the traders can play an important role at times of disaster and violence that sparked off similar to that of Ampara Mosques and Kandy District Mosques, houses and business Establishments. Hence, he organized this meeting and thanked the traders for attending this meeting in spite of their very busy schedule.
The Convener of the meeting and a well known social worker of the Business Community M. I. A. R. Buhary welcomed the traders and related the roles played by him at times of violence in the Ampara and the measures taken by him not to spread them elsewhere.
Colonel Wipula Chandrasiri in the outset of his address thanked the organizers for extending their invitation for him and said that he considered this opportunity as a great honour and privilege given to him. He also expressed his gratitude for the people of Akkaraipattu for behaving decently not engaging in any untoward incidents. They have decently expressed their sorrow and sympathy one day and thereafter they obeyed the instructions and advise given by All Mosques Federation and Jemmiayathul Ulama. He was happy that they did not engage in hartals, protests and picketing and disrupt the normal activities of the people of the area.
Colonel Chandrasiri continuing further, advised the traders that discipline of youngsters should be taken care of and said that every parent should concentrate on the activities and whereabouts of their children whom they trust are all on the path of education.
He noted with much regret that today, many children are in the habit of using drugs, liquors and engaged in other unwanted activities paving the way for others to follow. This should be completely stopped and they all should be vigilant of their children. If they are taught the discipline and good behaviours at the very beginning at their schooling, we can produce a disciplined society. If we can achieve this in our society and other neighboring societies, we can produce a controlled district. If we spread this to the neighboring districts as well, of course we can create a peaceful Sri Lanka, he said.
Stressing on the communal amity Col. Chandrasiri said that we must also follow the good habit of understanding each other and respect the other religions and culture. A community which has majority of people that may be Buddhists or Muslims or Hindus in a particular town or village should protect the minorities in that particular place.
A majority people of Buddhists may be a minority in a place where Muslims predominantly live. So, its the bounden duty of the Muslims to protect the Buddhists in such places. Similarly Buddhists should extend a helping hand to the Muslims at times of unrest.
For an example, I am now in your town as a minority and its the duty of you to safeguard me. If we follow this concept, we can create a peaceful Sri Lanka.
Members of the Business Community expressed their ideas as how best they can run these Associations and steps that should be taken to accelerate the activities to go ahead with new trends.
At the conclusion of the meeting, new officials were elected in which Trader M. I. A. R. Buhary was unanimously elected as President and A. M. M. Naleem as General Secretary.

ITS PUTIN ALL THE WAY
RUSSIA: Vladimir Putin was on Monday set for another six years in power after his landslide victory in Russias presidential election but so far only close allies have congratulated him as Moscows relations with the West disintegrate.
Putin, who has ruled Russia for almost two decades, recorded his best election performance with 76.67 percent of the vote but rejected the possibility of staying in power indefinitely.
The opposition said the results were rigged, reporting ballot stuffing and other cases of alleged fraud as the Kremlin pushed for a high turnout to give greater legitimacy to Putins historic fourth term.
Putin, who has extended his power until at least 2024 and is already Russias longest-serving leader since Stalin, ruled out remaining president for life. Listen to me. It seems to me that what you are saying is a bit funny, he told reporters Sunday night when asked if he saw himself running for president again in 2030. What, am I going to sit here until I am 100 years old No. The Russian strongman ran against seven other candidates, but his most vocal critic Alexei Navalny was barred from the ballot for legal reasons and the final outcome was never in doubt.
I see in this (result) the confidence and hope of our people, Putin said in an address to a crowd of supporters on a square next to the Kremlin after exit polls put him on track for a resounding victory.
Turnout was at more than 67 percent as authorities used both the carrot and the stick to boost engagement in the polls. Selfie competitions, giveaways, food festivals and childrens entertainers were laid on at polling stations in a bid to create a festive atmosphere around the election. But employees of state and private companies reported coming under pressure to vote.
According to central election commission data with 99.8 percent of ballots counted, Putin took 76.67 percent of the vote, well ahead of his nearest competitor Communist Party candidate Pavel Grudinin, who was on 11.79 percent.
Ultra-nationalist firebrand Vladimir Zhirinovsky took around 5.66 percent, former reality TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak was on 1.67 percent, while veteran liberal politician Grigory Yavlinsky received just over 1 percent of the vote. Navalny -- who called on his supporters to boycott the fake vote and sent more than 33,000 observers across the country to see how official turnout figures differed from those of monitors -- said there had been unprecedented violations. Navalnys opposition movement and the non-governmental election monitor Golos reported ballot stuffing, repeat voting and Putin supporters being bussed into polling stations en masse.
But the electoral commission dismissed most concerns, saying monitors sometimes misinterpret what they see. Runner-up Grudinin said the elections had been dishonest. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, who has lived in Russia after leaking classified information about the US governments surveillance programmes, tweeted a picture apparently showing ballot stuffing in a Russian school. - AFP

'Lanka needs intl exhibition centre'
Sri Lanka needs to set up an international level exhibition centre said Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, declaring open the International Printing Exhibition.
Participating as the Chief Guest at the opening of the International Printing Exhibition, Minister Dr. Amunugama said that an international level exhibition centre is necessary for Sri Lanka and that action should be taken towards that end. The International Printing Exhibition was held recently at the International Exhibition and Convention Centre in Colombo.
He also engaged himself in fact finding conversation with the printers present.
The Minister acquainted himself with the way in which modern printing work is done efficiently and the problems faced by printers.
Speaking further Minister Dr. Amunugama said that a big contribution is being made to the Sri Lankan economy by the Sri Lankan printing industry. The annual income earned in the printing industry today is US $ 200 million. The industry will before long reach the 500 million dollar target.
Today our country needs an international level exhibition centre. The present exhibition centre is not suitable at all for today. Therefore action should be taken to establish an international level exhibition centre. Such a centre is essential for Sri Lanka.
If we initiate action for establishing such a centre there are countries who will be prepared to contribute financially for setting it up. Therefore an international exhibition centre should be established quite soon,
Sectors like the garment industry, the gem and jewelry industry and the printing industry contribute a great deal to the Sri Lankan economy. Such private sector industries have progressed a lot. The service performed by such industries in pushing the economy forward is immense. It is the duty of the state to encourage and assist such industries. Obstructing them will retard economic progress.
Sri Lanka should be developed as a printing industry region. By doing, so it will be possible to earn a massive income for the country. We should do so. The full assistance and the attention of the government must be directed towards it.
Chairman Commercial Bank, Dharma Dheerasinghe, Chairperson E.D.B Ms. Indira Malwatta, President, Sri Lanka Printers Association, Lal Jayawardhana, Secretary of the same organization, Ranjith Fernando, many printers and foreign delegates participated at this event.

Lessons in motion
When you yawn, you open your mouth wide and take in a deep breath. In certain instances, you try your best not to open your mouth so wide. That struggle to keep the yawn unseen is a common experience. That mostly happens when you listen to a story that you cannot relate to yet. It could be a story so important, followed by an expressed purpose. But a yawn is inevitable if it does not appeal to you.
This is what bothered Wasantha Herath when he was a primary school teacher. He was not at ease with what the syllabus had to offer. The children took the lessons with yawns. Something had to be done to fix this, Herath contemplated in silence.
Fling the table
And then it occurred. The obstacle was right in front of the pupils: the teachers table. It occupied a massive space, which could have been brought into play more constructively. His sixth sense urged him to fling the teachers table, but he had to lie in wait.
Wasantha Herath. Pictures by Ruwan de Silva.
Wasantha Herath initiated his career as a trained Primary teacher. The curiosity for creativity encouraged him to explore various teaching methods to keep the pupils from boredom  or at least tone it down. He focused on education techniques when he undertook studies on sociology and education for his postgraduate research. The techniques were mostly on uplifting the student-centred education system.
We need to make the classroom an entertaining platform for the pupil. The space reserved for the teachers table could be used for something more constructive. So I converted that space into a theatre.
The Department of Education was more impressed with the concept than Herath could imagine, but they did not offer a complete thumbs-up to getting rid of the teachers table. They proposed to move the table to a corner as an alternative. Then came the next question. What can you do in that space It shall not be a traditional theatre. Space has to be utilized for a teaching-learning project as well.
That was Heraths aim. He could have used that space for computer and multimedia. But then he wanted it to be a more aesthetic experience. Then it occurred to Herath that he should try out muppets and puppets. He initiated that project with two friends adept at making puppets. They made different kinds of muppets such as sock, string and stick puppets.
Positive reception
Puppets and muppets are not actually different from each other. In a simple way, we can say that a muppet is actually a kind of puppet. Obviously, they have certain differences and that is why they are categorized separately. A puppet is a figure of an object, person, animal, bird, etc. The figures are not limited to a certain type or form or character. They are diverse. They are manipulated by a person called a puppeteer. Puppets are used to put up a puppetry show which is a very ancient form of theatre. Muppets, however, originated in 1954-55. They are also figures used to put up a show but the characters are limited, elaborates Herath sounding reflective, inspired by awe.
Encouraged by the positive reception of Education Department, Wasantha Herath formulated a course to train teachers in teaching using muppets and puppets. Yet, the project came to a standstill in 2002 due to lack of resources. Herath then adopted a strategic approach.
I realized that we have to work from something already available in the system. Then I reworked the system. I removed the teachers table to a corner. The teacher could stay anywhere. If he feels tired he can sit on the desk.
If the teacher does his job happily and aesthetically that creates a conductive environment where the pupil gets the maximum. They get an opportunity to immerse in aesthetic sense and entertainment. It is quite contrary to what the teacher is engaged in right now: teaching the syllabus as it is.
We cannot force the Government to stop the scholarship exam. But we can inject an aesthetic sense into the scholarship examination. Why cant we teach the child in an enjoyable manner I have now created muppets which I can transport by vehicles. Most educators encouraged me. They asked me not to give up.
Creative teaching
Simple in structure, Herath made sure that the muppets could be used in many instances for teaching. He received invitations from countries such as South Korea to conduct workshops on creative teaching. The muppets and puppets play a vital role in enhancing the childs conversation capacity.
We can adopt new strategies to narrate traditional stories. Let the child come up with his own version of that famous story of the rabbit and the tortoise. Use the muppets and the child will naturally come up with his own version. Let them enter the characters. From there, we can move on to many aspects, Herath elaborated.
And the good news is that the muppets and puppets could be made out of discarded items. The child is fond of motion. That is exactly why they are addicted to cartoons. If an adult wants to take the child away from cartoons, muppet is the best strategy, Herath suggests. The muppets are capable of anything under the sun.
Sri Lanka spends only 10 percent on early childhood. I do not think any other country has such a low percentage allocated to early childhood. If Sri Lanka pays proper attention to early childhood, we would not experience many issues. Early childhood is a vital stage medically, psychologically and sociologically. It is like a clay pot. Once formed, you cannot introduce amendments.
About 85 percent of the human body growth takes place under five years. The early childhood, according to Herath, is marked by three aspects: touch, talk and play. The childs main job is to play, which enhances the cognitive abilities and capacities. They do not require any teaching. Playing offers the best teaching during the early childhood.
Heraths meticulous research has earned him positions in various organizations such as World Bank and Asia-Pacific. Herath is currently the Deputy Director of Early Childhood Development Project of the World Bank.

New IR Act will create level playing field to do business - Mangala
The new Inland Revenue Act that becomes operational from April 1 will create a level playing field for everyone to do business moving away from the culture of preferential treatment, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The minister was addressing a public seminar conducted by the Inland Revenue Department on its new Act at Galadari Hotel yesterday.
The minister said the new Act would put an end to numerous ad-hoc tax concessions granted according to the whims and fancies of the Finance Minister of the day.
We are setting the platform and working continuously on promoting the business climate by enhancing tax payers protection and providing greater certainty on tax affairs. Through last years budget titled Enterprise Sri Lanka, our government showed steadfast commitment towards creating an investment friendly environment, Minister Samaraweera said.
Our aim is to create an environment of transparency, fairness and equity for every citizen and entrepreneur in future, the minister said. The minister, making a fervent plea to the participants to remind them of their collective responsibility to contribute to the development endeavours of the country, noted the current number of individuals and firms registered for paying taxes remains at a surprisingly low level.
These numbers are very hard to be corroborated with the realities, given the profile of corporate sector in the country and our labour market dynamics, he said, adding that the new Act was designed to broad base the tax payer and encourage all citizens to shoulder the development of the country, the minister added.
Your tax payments drive the countrys future. Your money goes into expenditure on education, health, infrastructure, environment protection, law and order, and welfare improvements, among others. Our government implements an array of subsidies and transfers for low income groups. We hope to further strengthen the Social Safety Net for the poor and vulnerable this year. We will continue to provide relief in the events of unforeseen events such as natural disasters. We are aiming at lessening imbalances in income and wealth creation in the country as we progress towards an upper-middle income country, Minister Samaraweera said. Observing that the new Act would bring a paradigm shift to taxation in the country, the minister said it needs methodical implementation.
He said the Government is in talks with the World Bank to widen the Social Safety Net to shield the poor and vulnerable from getting affected from the liberalization of the economy. For over two decades, Sri Lanka recorded a downward trend in tax revenue. Sri Lanka was among the countries with the lowest tax revenue in the world and in the region.
This new legislation carves a clear strategic direction about taxation in the country. We expect to increase the share of direct income tax against indirect taxes. The preferred ratio by 2020 is 40 percent to 60 percent from the current level of 18 percent to 82 percent. This is a challenging goal and the new Act is a preliminary step in that direction, he added.

No confidence motion against PM a futile attempt - Minister Harrison
The Joint Oppositions no confidence motion against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be rejected by a majority in the Parliament, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison said yesterday. Harrison also said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksas talks on toppling the government is easier said than done.
Minister Harrison made these observations at an event held to distribute agricultural equipment to farmers at Nachchadoowa, Anuradhapura.
Asked on the comments made by former President Rajapaksa to foreign media on toppling of the government, Harrison said this is not the first time such groundless statements have been made. Sometime back also Rajapaksa said that this government will be toppled in two months. Two months have gone by now. It will not be as easy as they think it would be. Harrison said.
Asked on the no confidence motion set out by the Joint Opposition, Minister Harrison said no UNP MP has or will sign the no confidence motion. They are bragging about all kinds of MPs who are going to sign this no confidence motion. But they have got the signatures of only forty or so. No one else has signed it. They dont have a majority. So it is very clear that this no confidence motion is rejected by the majority. Harrison pointed out. He also said that they are aware of Sri Lanka Freedom Party members signing the said no confidence motion. However, Harrison expressed his confidence, saying that the government still can secure a majority without them. No need to be agitated by such a move. he added.
This is not a one party led government. We have a coalition government with number of political parties in favour of it. So we must work together as a team. That is the responsibility of every partner. If they cannot be supportive, they should leave the government and hold on to their own opinions. That is what is proper. Criticizing the government while being partners of it, is a shameless act. Harrison also said.
When asked about the Treasury bond issue and the involvement of Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran, Minister Harrison said that all those who are involved in corrupted cases will be brought to book despite their loyalties.
Asked on the recent Local Government Election, Minister Harrison said, President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed to the SLFP and UNP to work together and establish power in certain LG councils. Several more political parties have agreed to support us. Accordingly, the government will be able to secure power in most of the LG councils. he explained.
Minister Harrison also said that the government will learn from lessons and move on to win the Provincial Council election. Asked on the fertilizer subsidy, Minister Harrison said farmers were not in favour of the limitations brought by the government, and said he is ready to amend them over time.
