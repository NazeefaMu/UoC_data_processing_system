Adult sized replica of Little Tikes toy car
It may look like a toy, but this full size replica car is road legal and ready to tear up the streets of Toytown at up to 70mph.
Brothers John and Geoff Bitmead from Oxfordshire made the giant recreation of a Little Tikes Cozy Coupe out of an old Daewoo Matiz SE 0.8.
They say it took about 1,000 hours to make the vehicle, and it cost 4,000 - but ask any school kid and theyll tell you it was worth every penny.
Unlike the foot-powered childrens version, this grown-up Coupe features a gas powered engine which can do 0-60 in 17 seconds and has a top speed of 70mph.
It can carry two adults and includes working headlights, mirrors, seat belts and even an airbag.
John and Geoffs company, Attitude Autos specialises in bespoke cars which they rent out for TV and film productions. They hope to use the vehicle to raise money for childrens charities. Mirror

Kingsly H. Perera
A jovial individual
Kingsly H. Perera passed away after a brief illness on September 21 at Ratnapura. He was 87 years old when he died.
Kingsly and I joined the Department of Health as radiographers on July 1, 1953. We were together during our training period for one year at the General Hospital, Colombo.
Kingsly as I know him from 1953, was a carefree, jovial and a fun-loving person. Even while at work, he used to come and have short chats with us, cracking some joke which made us burst into laughter and have a short, but pleasant time.
His hobby was playing his electric guitar.
After the training at the General Hospital, Colombo, in 1953/1954, Kingsly was transferred to General Hospital, Ratnapura, from 1955. He returned to General Hospital, Colombo, in 1961 for the MSR training course wherein I met him again. We used to have some fun with Kingsly during the lunch interval as we were more busy with following lectures at other times.
After being successful at the MSR (Lond) Exam in November 1961, Kingsly went on transfer again to General Hospital, Ratnapura. He retired in 1985 and out of his total service period of 32 years, he was stationed at the Ratnapura chest clinic and at the General Hospital, Ratnapura, for about 30 years.
He had a great liking for Ratnapura, so much so he made Ratnapura his second home by renting a house belonging to the church and remaining in that house for quite a long time.
It was shocking and sad for Kingsly to lose his wife in the year 2000. In spite of this unbearable loss, Kingsly was courageous to remain in the rented house at Ratnapura. He was very much loved and cared for by his only son, Ravi, who took great pains to look after his loving father during his last years.
At the death of Kingsly, I lost a kind-hearted and loving friend with whom I communicated until his last moments.
I offer my deepest sympathy to Ravi at the loss of his loving father.
I wish Kingsly an everlasting rest in the arms of Jesus and may his soul rest in peace!
Your loving friend, Marshall Fernando
Cyril Abeysekera
A true gentleman
When the Society of Structural Engineers  Sri Lanka was formed in 1989, it had no stable home and no employees. It was only in 1994 that the Society was able to start to get away from its nomadic existence and also employ someone full-time to help the Executive Committee with its day-to-day administrative tasks. The person who took over this responsibility was Cyril Abeysekera.
He was the third of nine children born in Matale to a father who was a school principal and a mother who was a school teacher. His eldest brother was the distinguished public servant and civil rights activist, Charles Abeysekera. The second, Victor, was an executive in the Mahaweli Authority. The fourth, Leslie, was a High Court Judge. Another brother was an engineer and yet another worked for ESCAP in Bangkok. The youngest brother is a retired doctor in New York. It was, however, only Cyril who followed the lead given by his father by taking to teaching and also marrying a teacher, Pushpa de Silva.
He studied at St. Thomass College in Matale, St. Sylvesters College in Kandy and also at Jaffna College, Vaddukkottai. He got a General Science degree from the University of Colombo, became a science teacher and was later a lecturer at the Maharagama Teachers Training College. He went on scholarship to Hiroshima in 1982 to learn about the latest methods in the teaching of science. Coincidentally, Pushpas brother had studied medicine in Hiroshima from 1954 to around 1962 before going on to the United States to become a successful Cardiologist in Chicago, where Cyrils daughter Erandathi is also a doctor. His son Udula is a bank executive in Colombo. Cyril retired from government service in 1987 and worked thereafter at the Sri Lanka Association for the Advancement Science until 1994, when he joined the Society of Structural Engineers  Sri Lanka as its Administrative Officer. He retired in 2010.
During these 16 years, Cyril was a tower of strength to four Presidents, including the writer, Eng. A. D. Wickremasinghe, Eng. S. A. Karunaratne and Eng. D. A. Jayasinghe. After a few of years helping the Executive Committee to organise some excellent engineering seminars, Cyril himself took over most of the responsibility for the logistical side of these demanding events. All members of the Society held him in high regard. Cyril was one of the most honest and courteous persons the writer has ever had to deal with, not only at the Society but elsewhere in the wider world.
He has never been known to say a harsh word about anyone, however unpleasant or incompetent that person was. In fact, the writers only doubt about Cyril would be that it was not possible to discern whether he cared more for his family, his friends or his dogs! He died on the July 1, this year, aged 85 and will be long-missed by those who knew him as the most gentle of gentlemen.
A. C. Visvalingam
M. H. M. Ashraff
A kind-hearted politician
Mohamed Hussain Mohamed Ashraff, a great and worthy son of the Eastern Province, was born in Sammanthurai. He was indeed not born with the proverbial silver spoon, but by the time of his untimely death, he had established himself as a silver lining in the politics of this country. Leaders are born everywhere in the world and the service rendered by them for the good of their community are many. Although such services are remembered by people now and then, all their names would not became historical.
Minister M. H. M. Ashraff's 17th year remembrance fell on September 16. During the short spell of half a dozen years, he was a Cabinet Minister, Member of Parliament and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and National Unity Alliance Founder Leader.
While on his way to his native Ampara District, the Sri Lanka Air Force helicopter which he was travelling in crashed at Aranayake. It has been almost 17 years since he left us, but his supporters never forgot him.
Ashraff's qualities of leadership and his respect for bureaucracy developed loyalty and team spirit. Ashraff was a kind-hearted, sensitive and emotional personality, always with a smile and kind word to greet his staff, colleagues and supporters. He was a leader who wanted things done correctly and was a stickler for correct details.
Ashraff was a deeply religious man and would commence nothing without remembering the Almighty and seeking his guidance and blessings.
He played a constructive role to install the former President Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga Government. Ashraff will be long-remembered by every citizen of this country as he strengthened the hands of the former President in her efforts to find a meaningful solution to the ethnic conflict.
Ashraff saw as nobody did before him, the political potential of the Eastern Province with its predominant Muslim habitation. Before his advent, Muslim polticians aligned themselves to the two major political parties; the UNP and SLFP. He was no doubt permitted by the waves of radicalism then sweeping across the Islamic world and the growing power of the Arab States.
In 1974, Ashraff joined the Attorney General's Department as a State Counsel and worked there to get himself acquainted with the law to become a lawyer. He practiced in Kalmunai and Batticaloa.
He completed a Master's Degree in Law prior to becoming a senior Minister. He was then honoured with title President's Counsel.
Ashraff had almost the entire Muslim communtiy behind him. They appreciated his vision, sincerity and the immense sacrifices he made for their cause.
The late minister entered Parliament in 1989 through his then newly-formed Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. As the leader of the party, he extended his support to late President R. Premadasa, though he was in the opposition. He maintained a cordial relationship with the President to win back the rights of the Muslim community. He never tolerated injustice or discrimination.
The late minister appointed thousands of unemployed youth at the Colombo Harbour. But he included Sinhalese and the Tamils too in this drive. No Muslim leader will be cherished and remembered as Ashraff as he strove to get a Universtiy for Muslims. The South East University is the biggest achievement of the Muslim community.
In his heart of hearts, Ashraff was a poet. Sri Lanka made a poet a politician.
Ashraff A. Samad
S. Tharmalingam
He was a loving father
Nearly three months have passed since the demise of my father at the age of 96, who spent the latter part of his life according to his wishes in his birthplace; Chunnakam East, Jaffna.
I have decided to pen some of the salient events that took place during his illustrious career and few of his admirable qualities because achievements of an officer and gentleman of such calibre, who served for a long period in Police Force without any blemish whatsoever, should go in records and be a good example for present-day Police officers.
My father commenced his career as constable in 1947 at the Bandarawella Police station after teaching for a short spell in Rakwana. Thereafter, he worked at various police stations, namely Diyatalawa, Badulla, Monaragala, Madulsima, Trincomalee, China Bay, Wellawatta and Bambalapitiya. Subsequently, in 1970, he was promoted to Sergeant and posted at Pettah. Afterwards, he was transferred to Mt. Lavinia and continued as a Court Sergeant. Consequently, he was attached to the ASP office in Dehiwala before his retirement in 1980, serving for 33 years in the Police force. Few contemporary high-calibre and well-respected officers whom I could remember, some of them who are no more, were Ana Seneviratne, Vamadevan and Ranmuthugala.
A noteworthy trait was his trilingual proficiency. This could be an ideal message to present day officials, for it contributes to the national policy towards building a united Sri Lanka. While working at Pettah, one German citizen had misplaced some important documents in Sri Lanka before his departure and this case was intimated to my father. Somehow, father was able to contact that foreigner and handed those documents to him at the airport. The foreigner wanted to compensate and father has had rejected it, as usual. Afterwards, this particular foreigner contacted the DIG and informed about this incident. My father was commended by the higher authorities. This is a lesson for junior Police officers and moreover, it demonstrates that if a person is very firm in his/her policies, no one can tarnish their image.
While on duty in the upcountry, the Police squad my father was a part of had come across a sambur in front of their jeep and the commanding officer (SI) had wanted to shoot it. Father advised the senior not to kill and this incident brought him praise from other police officers. This proved that he would never tolerate injustice and that he was strictly honest in every aspect.
At the Courts, he performed his duties exceptionally and received accolades from higher officials. At the time of his retirement, he received an 'Excellent Certificate' for his unblemished and dedicated services.
After retirement, he became a vegetarian and involved himself in Hindu religious activities in Trincomalee, while living with me for about 18 years when I was the Finance Director of the Provincial Treasury, EPC. He actively participated in numerous religious involvements, namely at the Koneswaram Temple, Muthukumaraswamy Temple and YMHA. He was offered the title 'Muuththa Othuwar (Senior songster)' and 'Sivanerith Thondar' at the felicitation ceremony held at Hindu college, Trincomalee, a few years back. Though we lost our mother during our schoolgoing days, he was our mentor and supported us wholeheartedly. He was a devoted husband to my beloved mother and a doting father to his children.
All the above merits are praiseworthy and we, as his children, adopted these principles. With regard to education, he enabled us to be educated in leading schools in Colombo. He was extremely proud of the achievements and careers of his grandchildren.
Thank you, father for giving us this wonderful life and for showing us the right path. Thank you for all the comfort and happiness you had brought into our life. There is no birth and there is no death for the Athma. The good deeds that we do go with us.
May his soul rest in peace with mother.
His eldest son, T. Sivananthakumar (FCA)

## Title: Be man enough to read a womans story!
## Supertitle:

Be man enough to read a womans story!
Legal and social restrictions made it difficult for women to easily take on literary careers. Women were not encouraged to become writers until fairly recently, and often did not dare publish under their own names, to protect their families from scandal. Despite rigid gender roles that emphasized a womans proper place in the domestic sphere, nineteenth century British women confidently took up the pen to write their own stories. The journey continued and today women are no strangers in the world of literature.
In Sri Lanka female writers do not appear to have been discriminated against because they are women. But perhaps as in any profession the criticism they face may be gender biased and often irrelevant to their work, says Ameena Hussein, the only writer from Sri Lanka to be long-listed for her work, The Moon in The Water for the first Man Asian Literary Award in 2007. Hussein has proven to be one of the powerful authors who can tell and sell a good story.
Writing process might be some times a challenge and in some places in the world women writers are burdened with societal norms and limits that they cannot easily challenge. Hussein happens to be among the lucky few who have the flair to pen down the formed thoughts or the dreams that happen to pass. Thus she now can call herself a writer.
Has it ever boggled her mind how a woman needs to write or did she meet roadblocks where she either decided not to go any further or decided to deliberately change the course of her process
While Sri Lanka is a South Asian country and still retains some of the chauvinism that is rife in the region, of all the countries, it is perhaps the most women friendly. I dont think I have faced any challenges as a woman writer per se and perhaps I am very lucky. I believe that today, most of the people writing in the English language are female writers. In the Sinhala literary field, it looks as if it is the same. Perhaps writing is one arena, where men and women can be judged equally. In the international arena not too long ago, it was believed that men wrote serious stuff and women wrote fluff. I doubt that anyone would direct that charge to Sri Lankan writers. Both men and women tackle difficult subjects and both men and women can write fluff quite well too, Hussein said.
Strong positive role models
She believes that the portrayal of women in literary works has shifted through the generations. Today you will find depictions of strong positive role models in literature. But I find that men rarely want to read of a woman protagonist or what may appear to them as a womans story. That to me is more troubling than any other. Parents dont want to buy books that deal with a female heroine for their sons. This conditioning may be what dissuades them from reading women centered books in later life, Hussein pointed out.
She is the co-founder of Perera Hussein Publishing House in Colombo, which publishes cutting-edge Sri Lankan writing in English. Hussein established the publishing house with her husband Sam Perera after she completed her studies in Los Angeles and returned to Sri Lanka in 2003. The Perera Hussein Publishing House has become the haven and meeting ground for many established and aspiring local writers.
A well-known writer herself, Hussein has published two collections of short stories. Her first book Fifteen a collection of short stories, published in 1999 was shortlisted for the Gratiaen award. Zillij, her next book, titled after a traditional Islamic art form of creating intricate designs using hand cut tiles gives the reader a glimpse into a bygone era whilst dealing with perplexing and troubling questions that has spilled over into the present day. It won her the State Literary Prize in 2005.
Limited ambitions
Being an author was not a profession or a career choice during the time I grew up in Sri Lanka. I had no idea what I wanted to be as a child. We grew up in an age, where parents had limited ambitions for their children. The scope was narrow and restricted to doctor, lawyer, engineer, accountant and so on, none of which had any appeal to me. It was a series of happy events that took me to study in Los Angeles that led me to do a degree in Sociology. Being an author was the farthest thing from my mind, Hussein says of her start.
But obviously, that has all changed. Today, there are many parents who say their children want to be authors and many children who will say they want to be authors. I am not sure what motivates them, though. Is it the stupendous success of authors like J.K. Rowling or is it that they think they write really well, or is it because they have stories to tell she questions.
For Hussein, inspiration and motivation to write a story can come at anytime and anywhere. Even the mundane can be inspiring for me. I must not be a very complicated person, because all of life inspires me. It has become a joke among my friends and family that I can travel to the Colpetty market and come back with a story! Yet there have been many people who have influenced and inspired me. My parents, my grand-aunt  a strong and formidable matriarch; my bosses, Neelan Tiruchelvam and Radhika Coomaraswamy; my first editor  Regi Siriwardene; and today I am constantly being inspired by people I come across, Hussein said.
Read. Read. Read. She says to the youth who are interested in writing. I worked for about ten days at the Colombo Book Fair, and saw too many parents and children shopping for text books exclusively. Fiction or nonfiction that is not related to their studies is considered a waste of time. Perhaps that accounts for their dismal vocabulary, spelling and speech. Reading gives you that edge, where you learn new words, see how sentences are constructed, imbibe spelling, and enjoy the time spent learning. It is effortless, she said.
Family life and work
Hussein sees just a little separation between family life and work. I happen to work with my husband and partner in business Sam Perera and so we have the opportunity to talk shop at any given moment. Many times a benefit though sometimes it is a hindrance. But on the whole, since I work for myself it is all about having a balance. Sometimes one wins and sometimes the other. Its like any other life, I suppose, she says.
The publishing house Perera Hussein has just entered the non-fiction arena from this year, and I am enjoying it hugely. For many years, we felt that fiction was our forte, but this expansion has given the publishing house an added dimension we didnt have earlier. As for me, I too am involved in a non-fiction project that will hopefully result in a book on Ibn Battuta the fourteenth century traveler. I dont like to plan too many projects at the same time, I like the year to bring me strange and interesting things that I would like to get involved in.
As expected the publishing house will have its usual quota of manuscripts that I will have to edit and make ready for publication for the coming years. My plan for next year is to devote equal time to my own work as well as my assigned work. Hopefully, fingers crossed, my new book will come out soon, Hussein said of her future plans giving hope for readers to await another exciting book on the shelf.

Carmart retains MTI to strategize legacy of family business
Carmart, one of Sri Lankas pioneering auto businesses, has retained the services of MTI Consulting to chart the groups strategic direction and to gear the business to capture the opportunities that the Sri Lankan economy will offer the transportation sector in the next 5 to 10 years.
Carmart was founded in 1948 by late Clarence P. Amerasinghe, who began by importing used Peugeot and Volkswagen cars. In 1953, the company obtained official agreements and became the authorized distributor in Sri Lanka for the brands.
This family owned business had evolved over the past six decades and has established its legacy not only in the Sri Lankan market, but also in the Asian region as the oldest importer for Peugeot.
Today Carmart is the Sri Lankan authorized importer, authorized repairer, and spare parts distributor for Peugeot and Mazda, and has just commenced working with Sinotruk, Chinas largest export-market manufacturer of heavy vehicles.
Carmart Director/CEO Yasendra Amerasinghe said that this family owned business had been through tremendous changes over the past six decades and have faced many operational challenges, namely in sales and marketing and HR.
He further stated that the development of a strategic direction for the organization will focus on improving sales and optimizing efficiency within the organization, and indicated Carmarts plans to expand its range of models, as well as its return to the commercial vehicle segment.
MTI CEO Hilmy Cader stated that the strategic direction for Carmart will be recommended based on a combination of studies carried out by evaluating avenues to rationalize costs, analyzing the organizations detailed financials and comprehensively assessing market insights. The project outcome will enable the directors of Carmart to focus on more specific areas of the business and the automobile industry.
Since its inception in 1997, MTI has delivered over 620 projects in over 40 countries. The Bahrain based boutique consultancy firm specializes in providing solutions to clients on the areas of strategy, business operations, corporate finance, talent and resourcing, go to market and tech advisory.
In Sri Lanka, MTI has had the past experience of working with AMW, DIMO, Toyota Lanka and United Motors, and in the Gulf with Ahmed Zayani who represent Chrysler, Skoda and Bentley.

## Title: The central story of our lives
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Monday, October 23, 2017 - 01:00
The central story of our lives
Once upon a time science seemed destined to replace religion as the source of all explanations. Today, however, story has become the master metaphor that we use to interpret experience, including the mysteries of God and Nature. This recourse to story-talk is everywhere, uniting the two cultures, the arts and sciences.
It is thus not surprising to find the astrophysicist Sean Carroll endorsing Muriel Rukeysers line of poetry, The universe is made of stories, not of atoms. Carroll used it to support his own brief for the poetic naturalism of science: That is absolutely correct. There is more to the world than what happens; there are the ways we make sense of it by telling its story.
This cultural turn from metaphysics to metafictions helps to explain why so many readers, young and older, have greeted Philip Pullmans La Belle Sauvage as if it were the Second Coming. A forthright atheist, Pullman has made the secular balm of stories one of his principal themes, finding in them the capacity to enchant, to excite, to move, to inspire. This holds true for science stories as well, assuaging our fear that science repudiates wonder for analysis, prescriptive morals for descriptive accuracy.
Pullman insists that scientific narratives can be as marvellous as fairy tales, and as ethical as a chivalric quest. The key is that we have to behave honestly towards them and to the process of doing science in the first place.
Postmodernisms delight
These are among the salutary messages conveyed in Pullmans own tales, which combine the moral earnestness of the nineteenth century with the self-reflexivity of the twentieth. He is also conversant with postmodernisms delight in the endless play of signifiers, but doesnt find that approach helpful when it comes to crafting dynamic, vividly realized tales capable of appealing to all ages. Pullman modestly declares that he writes vulgar stories, not highfalutin literature; his faith in the elemental power of inventive plots, plausible characters and limpid prose produces page-turners pleasing to the child in us all. Yet his broad allusions to literature and science, and the larger philosophic themes that oxygenate his narratives without choking their momentum, are notably grown-up.
(The alethiometer, an instrument that captures truth through symbols, is brilliant as it is  but it is even better for operating through a Keatsian negative capability.) He is unapologetically Victorian in his belief that stories should be morally engaging and socially responsible.
Pullman is also surprisingly Victorian in his residual suspicion of fantasy, even as he conjures into life talking bears and flying witches. In Daemon Voices, a collection of luminously written (if occasionally contradictory) essays on the nature, techniques and joys of fiction, he maintains that he is a realist rather than a fantasy writer.
He infinitely prefers the company of George Eliot to that of J. R. R. Tolkien, let alone his thousand imitators: There isnt a character in the whole of The Lord of the Rings who has a tenth of the complexity . . . of even a fairly minor character from Middlemarch. He concludes that fantasy is a great vehicle when it serves the purposes of realism, and a lot of old cobblers when it doesnt.
Comparing Tolkien to Eliot, though, is a mugs game, and it becomes only sillier when Pullman invokes Jane Austens Emma to further reprove the delinquent don. Tolkien was obviously not writing a novel of psychological realism concerning middle-class mores.
He was doing the opposite, reviving the heroic epic in the face of realisms cultural predominance. One might object to Tolkien for many reasons, but failing to be a realist isnt one of them.
Pullmans disquiet is even more surprising in the light of his own essay on the epic, a form he commends for being about large and public matters like the return of a king, and featuring protagonists who are larger than human beings, and perhaps simpler too: they are heroes.
Unfettered imaginativeness
Such conflicting views suggest the question of where Pullmans ambivalence about fantasy is rooted. Throughout Daemon Voices he displays wide knowledge and affection for the fantastic in all its forms, including folk tales, fairy stories and comics. But regardless of the reason, the authors hesitations about fantasy have a peculiar relevance at this moment. In an age of alternative facts and virtual realities, many are searching for ways to enjoy an unfettered imaginativeness without undermining reason or neglecting the natural world. These are also Pullmans concerns, his fiction and essays proffering insightful strategies on maintaining a viable balance.
La Belle Sauvage is indeed a second coming. It is the initial instalment of The Book of Dust, the second trilogy concerning the fate of Lyra Belacqua, a young girl adept at affecting change through stories. The novel bears the heavy burden of its precursor, His Dark Materials (19952000), which for sheer narrative panache would be hard to beat. This previous sequence of novels encompassed Heaven and Earth, the underworld and parallel worlds. Its God is eventually exposed as a doddering, tyrannical impostor, and summarily dispatched. After killing God, what can Pullman do for an encore
We are once again in Lyras world, an alternative version of our own that is reassuringly familiar and strikingly different. Humans have daemons, externalizations of their psyches that restlessly assume different animal forms in childhood, eventually settling into a final form upon maturity. The Church, or Magisterium, predominates, wielding the doctrine of original sin to restrict freedom of thought and expression. The Magisterium is opposed by freethinkers such as Lyras father, Lord Asriel. Any precarious balance this society had has been destabilized by the discovery of Dust, invisible particles that are conscious, and may be the ultimate cause of all awareness in the universe. The two contending parties rush to capitalize on this discovery for their own purposes. Lyra appears to be the key they both need: centuries before, the witches of her world learned that Lyras destiny would be to bring about the end of destiny.
Natural craftsman
The events of La Belle Sauvage occur a decade before those of His Dark Materials. At the outset, we are introduced to the eleven-year-old Malcom Polstead and his daemon Asta. The only son of an Oxford innkeeper, Malcolm is kind, gentle and curious (and a little bland), a natural craftsman who enjoys trawling the local rivers in his canoe, La Belle Sauvage. He helps the nuns at the nearby Priory, whom Pullman depicts sympathetically, atoning for his uniformly negative portrayal of the religious in His Dark Materials. Here Malcolm encounters the six-month-old Lyra, who has been entrusted to the Priory for safe keeping. She manifests the feisty, outgoing nature that will serve her well in the years to come. Malcolm is charmed, and comes to love her: He was her servant for life.
And a good thing too, for Lyras life is in peril. The Magisterium, aware of the witches prophecy, is searching for her, perhaps with the intention of killing her. Her mother, who has allied herself with the Magisterium to gain power, seeks her as well  and not necessarily for maternal reasons. Lyra is also stalked by a genuinely frightening figure who claims to be her real father: Gerard Bonneville, a physicist who boasts of having discovered the secrets of Dust. He is also a convicted paedophile. Bonneville seems kindly but his daemon, a bloodthirsty hyena with a manic laugh, gives the game away. He pursues his young quarry relentlessly, in scenes reminiscent of the film The Night of the Hunter (1955).

Legal aid indeed
This course was conducted by the Legal Aid Commission for the tenth time. Different spheres of personnel attended the course which lasted for three months. Nowhere in Sri Lanka that anyone can get a Legal Knowledge for paltry sum, which this commission charges to cover their overheads. Comparing to the amount paid, the knowledge gained is worth a Lakh.
Panel consisted of a galaxy of eminent legal luminaries, who delivered lectures on different topics. The lectures are helpful to any citizen within the waters of Sri Lanka for their day-to-day lives. Most of the citizens in Sri Lanka are ignorant of what they are granted by the constitution and the legal documents they should possess for their daily needs.
The course was embedded with labour regulations i.e. EPF, ETF, gratuity, human rights, types of laws etc.
I strongly recommend this to be a course to be followed by all professionals in any organisation.
The course was coordinated in a diplomatic and professional manner by filling the hearts and minds of all students.

Climate smart investments
Engaging the private sector in climate-smart investments will be a cornerstone to growing climate business. In many sectors they already play a large role, supplying nearly a third of global investment in research and development of new renewable energy technologies, or $2.5 billion in 2016 alone. Scaling these technologies up to meet targets set in the Paris climate agreement, however, will require trillions more in innovative climate-smart investments particularly in emerging markets. And this presents us with opportunities. In fact, IFC estimates that 21 developing countries alone hold over $23 trillion in climate-smart investment opportunities through 2030. Given our own efforts at urban redevelopment, the article focuses climate-smart approaches to investments.
agribusiness
Unquestionably, meeting future demand for food will be one of the worlds greatest climate-related challenges. The human population is projected to grow from 7.3 billion as of 2015 to 9.7 billion by 2050. Without robust steps to increase productivity and climate resilience of agricultural practices, business-as-usual is expected to reduce global agriculture yields by up to 50 percent by 2030. Fortunately, businesses are beginning to employ climate-smart agriculture measures that can dramatically increase productivity and resilience while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. IFC is focused on helping scale these practices by providing investment and support for specific agribusiness needs, including increasing productivity of animal protein producers, optimizing inputs through precision agriculture, and reducing food waste through investments in logistics and infrastructure.
Green buildings
Another significant impact of global population growth will be the rapid growth of urban environments which will exert pressure on existing building stocks. Buildings are estimated to be responsible for about one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions.
This challenge also creates an opportunity for climate-smart investment in green buildings. To help private lenders understand and engage in this opportunity, IFC is helping promote a universal and accessible green performance standard to identify areas for cost savings in buildings. The IFC EDGE programme offers developers and investors a free tool to choose options to reduce consumption of energy, water, and extracted materials in new and existing building stock.
Smart cities
As global population and incomes rise, 70 percent of developing country populations are expected to live in cities by 2050. This opens doors for opportunities to build smart cities, capable of sustainably meeting demand for infrastructure in urban environments, and private sector interventions are now dramatically changing urban landscapes.
Energy storage
In some of the emerging economies, solar and wind energy technologies are often underutilized because they suffer from variable supply, known as intermittency.
Energy storage solutions can help reduce these impacts by providing a backup generation option. New research from IFC suggests that over the coming decade, energy storage technologies will grow 40 percent annually in emerging markets.
This growth is likely to unlock significant environmental, social, and economic benefits. IFC is growing this market through early-stage venture capital investments in energy storage markets, ranging from lithium-ion battery technologies to photovoltaic (PV) storage systems.
Green Bonds
A critical challenge remains the ability to scale up climate-smart investments bringing new financiers into the climate-smart investment space. For example, institutional investors, comprised of pension funds, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, manage $71.4 trillion in assets but currently play a limited role in global climate finance. To attract these investors, climate-smart projects must offer scale, safety, and simplicity.
IFCs Green Bonds Programme has been very successful in engaging these investors, issuing over $5.7 billion in 13 currencies through 74 green bonds on its own balance sheet over the last decade.
Together, these sectors represent the frontier of climate-smart investment. Innovation in climate-smart agribusiness, green buildings, smart cities, and finance can transform the way global economies function to align with a sustainable future where green growth is a norm, not an exception.

Current export crops production low compared to 2015
It was learnt that the export crops production during the past two years have been low compared to the overall production in 2015. Under the circumstances, the Export Agriculture Department has embarked on a cultivation promotion programme in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Kurunegala, Ampara, Baticalo, Mullathivu, Vavnuniya, etc., not confining the traditional crop-growing zones such as the upcountry and the South.
According to the Export Agriculture Department, 15,025 hectares have been cultivated with export agriculture crops such as cinnamon, cardamom, cocoa, clove, areca nut, ginger, turmeric and pepper in these districts. The Kandy district is in the foremost in the export agriculture crops cultivation, covering 17,173 hectares.
The World Bank provides financial facility amounting to USD 40 million for materializing the crop-development activities. The exporting volume and the income from export of the export crops have dropped significantly in 2016. In 2016, only 44,861 MT of export crops against the 71,588 MT in 2015 had been exported. In 2015, the income earned from exporting the crops was Rs. 61,588 million whereas the earnings in 2016 has been Rs. 51,739 million.
It was further learnt that especially the pepper production was very low and in 2015, around 16,656 MT of pepper was exported, while only 7,876 MT of it was able to be shipped.
The income from pepper exporting in 2015 had been Rs. 19,542 million and dropped down to Rs. 10,531 million last year.
However, on the other hand, our cinnamon has been gaining a promising foreign market. We have sold cinnamon 1,000 MT last year than what was exported in 2015. The income earned was Rs. 23,176 by exporting 14,693 MT last year, a spokesman of the Export Agriculture Department told the Daily News.
At present, Mexico buys 46 percent of the country's cinnamon production. India purchases large stocks of cardamon, pepper, clove, cocoa, and areca nut from us.
The USA and some Latin American countries mainly buy our cinnamon. Export Agriculture Department Director General Dr. Seneviratne said that at present, cinnamon, clove, cocoa, pepper, cardamom, nutmeg, citronella, areca nut, betel, vanilla, ginger and turmeric are among the main export agriculture crops growing in the country.
He hoped that the forthcoming Kandy-based World Pepper Day Summit would provide us a golden opportunity for attracting a range of new international buyers. A crop-marketing promotion campaign is also being planned parallel to the summit.

Dalugoda main culvert in need of urgent repair
The main culvert at Dalugoda, on the Thihagoda-Welletota via Malimbada main road, is on the brink of collapse. It has badly affected motorists as well as pedestrians, residents complained.
Residents said that several road accidents have already occurred there, as that point of route is broken and narrow. It is hardly possible for two vehicles to pass each other at that point. People urge Road Development Authorities to construct a new bridge here with strong side walls in place of the dilapidated culvert for the safety motorists and pedestrians.
According to residents, they use this highway to reach Kadduwa, Malimbada, Kanburupitiya, Akuressa and many other far off destinations in the Southern region.
In addition, it is used as a short route to the Godagama interchange of the Southern Expressway.

A day in the life of a freelancer
Its commonplace for literary journals to interview well-known writers and, at some point, to ask them about their process, what their days look like.
When I was a younger woman, back in the days when I longed to call myself a writer, but knew that I had not yet established any kind of writerly authority to claim the mantle, I remember reading an interview with Graham Greene. He explained how he was able to write one novel per year: he told his interlocutor that he held himself to a standard of 500 words per dayno more, no lessand that, in the course of a year, that would produce a novel.
At about that same time, I was struggling to be a writer, an ambition that took a direct hit after being sexually harassed by my writing professoralthough at the time, I thought it was my faultI had even fantasized that if my lifes ambitions were to come true, some day I would live in a cottage by the sea, and I would support myself by writing.
Thirty years after that fantasy, I do live in a bungalow 300 yards from the Atlantic Ocean, close to a beach unknown to tourists. And I support myself with my writing. On one hand, I know that I am living a dream life, and in todays parlance, Im grateful for the way that my life has turned out.
So, why was I sobbing earlier this week as if I had awoken to discover that I was Willy Loman, being worn out by the constant struggle
If someone were to ask me about my writing process, it would not bear any resemblance to Graham Greenes. I am up most days between 4 and 5 am. I consider those wee hours to be my time for reading the news, surfing the internet, looking for new things to write about. Depending on how much time is already scheduled during my day, I may begin working on my first freelance article by 5 am, with the goal being that I will have the standard 800-1200 words for most internet content written, edited, and emailed to an editor by 9 am.
After I get the first article out of the way, I may spend an hour or two looking at various internet boards where editors post calls for material, and, if I have an idea for something I think will fit, I prepare and send off pitches. I also send pitches to editors with whom Ive previously worked to see if I can sell them any new ideas for stories I have rattling around in my brain. I prepare pitches for future publications, too. Since I review books, I receive galleys months in advance.
If I am trying to get an assignment reviewing a certain book, it means contacting a print magazine editor several months in advance. Different magazines are operating on different editorial calendars, so I time my pitches to whatever month each magazine editor is taking pitches for.
During the day, I also read: research materials, book galleys, follow online newspaper stories and current events, whatever material I may need to know in order to formulate ideas.
Sometimes, I sit down in front of my laptop at 4 am and, except to go to the bathroom or to make coffee, I dont get up until mid-afternoon. I cant remember the last time that breakfast or lunch didnt comprise some type of meal replacement biscuits or cheese and crackers. I eat a decent dinner, but during the workday, there isnt time to fix a healthy lunch.
What drives me through my day is panic. I have to hustle. I have to pitch every weekday in order to make certain that I always have work lined up.
The internet has created an enormous, yawping need for content. Each day, some sites are putting out the equivalent of a daily magazine. They are reliant on freelance writers to supply them with articles.
But for each 800-1200 words that I write for my usual clients, the average compensation I receive is between $100 and $150 for each article (a range of between 8 and 19 cents per word). I know I am lucky. I am able to consistently secure writing jobs that pay that much. I know from watching the boards that a lot of outlets are paying between $25 and $50 for the same number of words. As shocking as that low number is, lots of writers still compete for those slots.
The reason I hustle is simple. As a grownup with a car payment, rent, insurance, utility bills, and all of the expenses of daily life, I need to write 30 articles per month just to break even. And that covers my expenses, but doesnt pay for extras like dinners out, clothes, or anything that isnt a necessity. What keeps me from having to write 30 articles per month are those golden assignments that pay three to four the rates of ordinary articles. If I can manage one of those per week, it can help relieve some of the incessant pressure. - Lit Hub

Devolution to strengthen people, not politicians: President
Power should be devolved to strengthen the people and cater to their needs rather than to strengthen politicians. The main objective of devolution of power is to ensure dividends of development and facilities to everyone on an equal basis, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made this observation addressing the concluding ceremony of the Janapathi Nila Mehewara Presidential Mobile Service at the Saivapragasa Balika Vidyalaya, Vavuniya on October 21.
The President who observed that the present government was committed to undertake development work and political reforms needed for the country, added that it was natural to encounter opposition in implementing that programme.
Those opposing political reforms should act with a clear understanding of the reality of the urgent problems confronting the country today. They should bear responsibility for any future problems encountered due to the non solution of present day problems, the President said.
The irony was that people who criticised and protested against this programme had no proposals of their own for solving those problems, President Sirisena said.
The President said he would request all of them to forward proposals regarding the urgent political reforms the country needed. The Steering Committee report tabled in Parliament for debate and incorporating the ideas and views of all had clearly mentioned the unitary status of the country, pre-eminent position given to Buddhism and a society with harmony and equality among people.
President Sirisena who said that certain people were trying to create a wrong public impression by highlighting facts not included in the Steering Committee report said that certain sections of the media including certain newspapers were publishing false and fabricated news items to mislead the people.
The President requested all of them to act by identifying their responsibility by the nation.
The Nila Mehewara Presidential Mobile Service programme had concluded 63 regional programmes. The programme held recently and centred on the Vavuniya District was the third national level programme.
This programme conducted by the Home Affairs Ministry had successfully conducted national level programmes in the Polonnaruwa and Galle districts.
Distribution of 5,000 title land deeds to people without title deeds to their lands in the district, prizes for students with the highest marks in the Grade 5 Scholarship Examination, coconut seedlings offered by the Coconut Development Board, bottled water for people encountering drinking water problems and handing over of two water bowzers were made under the patronage of President Sirisena at this ceremony.
The President who went on an observation tour of the mobile service premises paid attention to the peoples problems.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers Vajira Abeywardena, S.B. Nawinna and Rishard Bathiutheen, State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran Northern Province Governor Reginald Cooray, Parliamentarian K. Cader Masthan, A.M. Sumanthiran and Selvam Adailalanadan wee also present on the occasion.

Dismay over failed Indo-Lanka talks
Fishermen leaders have expressed dismay over the failure of the third meeting of the India-Sri Lanka Joint Working Group (JWG) and the ministerial meeting that followed to work out a time frame for the release of fishermen and more than 130 trawlers detained in Sri Lanka and to end bottom trawling in the Palk Bay.
The leaders regretted that the meetings held in New Delhi on October 13 and 14 to discuss fishermen issues and the release of the apprehended fishermen and their trawlers detained in Lanka for more than a year ended without arriving at any tangible decisions.
It is very unfortunate that the Lankan side ended the meetings after making a vague statement that it would take up the issues relating to the release of fishermen and trawlers at an appropriate forum, fishermen leader P. Sesu Raja said.
After the recent release of fishermen and 42 trawlers, impounded by the Lankan navy in April 2015, the fishermen had high hopes that the JWG, set up to address their issues, and the ministerial level meeting would work out a time frame for the release of fishermen and their trawlers, but the meetings turned out to be a formality, he said.
It was unfortunate that the Sri Lankan side, while acknowledging Indias recent initiatives to end bottom trawling in the Palk Bay, had not changed its stance that it would continue to prevent illegal fishing in Lankan waters and arrest Indian fishermen who trespassed.
We had high hopes that India will prevail upon the Lankan side and secure the release of fishermen and boats and give time to phase out bottom trawling in the Palk Bay only to be disappointed, the leaders said.
After the meetings, the Indian and Sri Lankan sides agreed that a lasting solution to the fishermen issue should be found at the earliest but made no serious efforts towards the direction, they felt. The Lankan side only seemed to be crushing the livelihood of Indian fishermen, they alleged.
Pointing that they were making sincere efforts to switch over to deep sea fishing, the leaders said a lasting solution could be found only if the fishermen were given one or two years to phase out bottom trawling in the Pak Bay.
Stating that there was no assurance from the Lankan side, they said only if the trawlers were released, those fishermen could opt for tuna long liners. - The Hindu

Du Plessis injury spoils SA win
East London: An injury to captain Faf du Plessis took some of the gloss off a comprehensive South African win in the third and final one-day international against Bangladesh at Buffalo Park on Sunday.
Du Plessis retired hurt on 91 and had to be helped off the field with an acute lower back strain and took no further part in the match as South Africa completed a series clean sweep, winning by 200 runs.
He was withdrawn from the two-match Twenty20 international series which will complete what has been a dismal tour by Bangladesh.
Du Plessis was the top scorer in South Africas 369 for six, their highest one-day total against Bangladesh and the highest total at the ground. Bangladesh were bowled out for 169.
It was another humiliating defeat for Bangladesh, who suffered defeats by ten wickets and 104 runs in the first two matches after similarly lop-sided losses in two Test matches.
Bangladesh were hit by injuries, notably to leading bowler Mustafizur Rahman, who missed all three matches, and opening batsman Tamim Iqbal, who only played in one game.
It was a big blow but we cant make any excuses, said captain Mashrafe Mortaza. The rest of the guys have been playing brilliantly in the last three or four years.
Mortaza said the failure of his bowlers to take wickets in South African conditions had been a major problem, while the batsmen had also failed, particularly on Sunday. It was a brilliant wicket for batting, he said.
Du Plessis was named man of the match but could not collect his award. AB de Villiers, who took over the captaincy, said: We have had a really good series. Today was probably our best performance because this wicket probably suited them (Bangladesh) the most.
Du Plessis looked set for a ninth one-day international century before he pulled up as he turned for a second run. He had to be helped off the field. He hit ten fours and a six and only faced 67 balls.
Temba Bavuma, one of three changes in South Africas top seven in the batting order, made 48 and helped Quinton de Kock (73) put on 119 for the first wicket, while new cap Aiden Markram hit 66 as he and Du Plessis added 151 off 116 balls for the third wicket before Du Plessis retired hurt.
As in his Test debut, when he made 97 against the same opponents last month, Markrams innings was ended by a run-out. Markram hit four fours and two sixes in an impressive 60-ball innings.
The match was soon over as a contest as Bangladesh lost their first five wickets for 61. There was a brief fightback as Shakib Al Hasan (63) and Sabbir Rahman (39) put on 67 for the sixth wicket before both fell to part-time off-spinner Markram.
Fast bowler Dane Paterson took three for 44.
De Kock was named man of the series. He scored 287 runs and was only dismissed twice. Cricket South Africa announced that JP Duminy will take over as captain for the Twenty20 internationals, to be played in Bloemfontein on Thursday and Potchefstroom next Sunday. AFP

Duchamps last riddle
By now, the story has become a legend: in 1917, artist Marcel Duchamp took a urinal, signed it with a pseudonym, and submitted it for an exhibition put on by the Society of Independent Artistswho rejected it. Fountain, as he winkingly titled the urinal, was one of his ready-mades: a manufactured object that he deemed artworks in an effort to throw off the yoke of what he called retinal art in favor of a more conceptual and cerebral one.
Duchamp was good at gestures. Just six years after the Fountain controversy, he announced he was quitting the art world and would devote the rest of his life to his other passion, chess.
Most people believed he had. But when he died in 1968, at the age of eighty-one, his grandest gesture was revealed: Duchamp had been constructing an artwork in secret for twenty years. He left it behind in his studio on Manhattans East Eleventh Streeta mysterious, life-size tableau. It featured a realist sculpture of a naked woman lying on a bed of twigs and leaves with her legs spread open.
Immediately inspired
She could have been dead or unconscious, except that her left arm held aloft a gas lamp, behind which glowed a landscape of colorful trees and a waterfall.
The uncanny scene was visible through a cutout in what seemed to be a brick wall, which itself was fronted by an old wooden door with two peepholes in it.
Looking through the peepholes wasand still isthe only way to see the tableau.
Duchamp left detailed instructions for how to transport the work out of his studio, and the next year the piece was put on permanent display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It immediately inspiredand continues to inspiremuch consternation.
The artist Jasper Johns, a Duchamp devotee, called it the strangest work of art in any museum.
Questions abound: Is it the scene of a sex crime or some kind of psychological projection Is it a perverse study in artistic perspective Did the man who invented ready-mades give up on them in old age and return to retinal art The air of mystery is further thickened by the artworks titletant donns: 1 la chute deau, 2 le gaz dclairage  (Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas )which reads like a logic puzzle without an answer.
Duchamp died on October 2, 1968. Exactly forty-nine years later, on October 2 of this year, his East Eleventh Street studio was reopened for two weeks to a select group of invited guests.
Inside, visitors discovered a full-scale replica of tant donns, accompanied by another, newer riddle.
Nobody can convince me that he didnt look at it this way, says the artist Serkan Ozkaya. I find it insulting to think that a master of shadows didnt look at it in the dark. Ozkaya is talking about Duchamp and tant donns, and, indirectly, about his own replica, which is titled We Will Wait. Were sitting in Duchamps former studio, alongside a wall of black plastic sheeting that covers the reconstructed tableau. The industrial material gives the space a gritty, worked-in feel. It makes for a jarring contrast with the glowing, untouchable vision that lies just on the other side.
Way of perception
tant donns is not Ozkayas first copy. In 2012, he built a gold replica of Michelangelos David at almost double the scale of the original and drove it through the streets of New York. He often uses (or proposes) reproductions in his work, casually casting off the presumed value of originality. But in the case of tant donns, Ozkaya remade the work because he has a theory: he thinks that, in addition to compelling visitors to look in, the artwork is meant to double as a machine that projects out. Given that its form is an enclosed room with two small holes in the door, tant donns is a natural camera obscuraan optical device wherein a scene on one side of a wall is projected, upside-down, onto the other side of the wall through a tiny hole. All youd have to do to see the image it projects is enshroud the space outside of it in darkness.
So thats what Ozkaya did, about two and half years ago. I hadnt even seen the work until I had the idea of it operating as a camera obscura, he admits. -Paris Review

Ensure Government fulfil its promises: Sampanthan tells UN Special Rapporteur
Opposition Leader and Tamil National Alliance leader R. Sampanthan yesterday urged the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Promotion of Truth, Justice Reparation and Guarantees of Non-Recurrence, Pablo de Greiff, to ensure the full implementation of voluntary commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government to the public and the international community.
Sampanthan said the commitments were made by the Government for the betterment and the advancement of the country and for its people, therefore, the Government must honour its commitment and deliver so that the commitments do not end with just blueprints.
The Opposition Leader, who met special rapporteur Greiff in Colombo yesterday, discussed the issues of political prisoners, lands and missing persons in length.
Sampanthan said that Tamil people have strong attachment to the lands not merely a sentimental but much beyond that and people were protesting demanding the release of their lands in some areas for nearly a year. They are exposed to all kinds of elements but they are determined that they want their land to be returned, he said.
He said the Government must understand that they were dealing with feelings of people and their rights. The issue must be resolved without any further delays. If we are seeking for a genuine reconciliation the realities must be recognised, he said.
Sampanthan said a mother who handed over her son to armed forces or a police officer wanted to know what happened to the son and it was a legitimate demand. Therefore, such demands could not be ignored, he said.
The Opposition Leader said the importance of having the Office of the Missing Persons and said the Northern and Eastern Provinces also need such offices.
Sampanthan said the Government needs to understand the political dimension of political prisoners.
They are in custody not because they robbed or stole for personal gain. Every case has a political dimension. Their cases need to be looked at in that context and resolved, he said.
The Government has already accepted that the PTA is a detrimental law that should be removed from the statutory books, he said.
He said outcome of these unresolved issued would be detrimental to the reconciliation process encouraged by the governmen. There are people waiting to disturb the reconciliation and the political solution process and we must not play into the hands of those people, he said.
The Special Rapporteur appreciated Sampanthan and assured him the UNs involvement in achieving a lasting solution to the national issue in Sri Lanka.

Fearless at 85
Trish Wagstaff spends her days taking on all sorts of daring activities including skydiving, paragliding, abseiling and even wing walking. The fearless widow has raised more than 150,000 for charity after a decade of stunts.
Trish, who had a hip replacement in 2002, said: A lot of my friends and family think Im absolutely bonkers. I started doing it a year after my husband died, but if he had been alive he would have said, No you wont.
My son came along and took photos when I was swimming with sharks. I think he was more nervous than me.
Its no more dangerous than crossing the road when a car is coming. Trish, of Appleton, Oxon, first got the daredevil bug when she swam with sharks at Blue Planet Aquarium at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.
She has also been on the longest zipwire in Europe and performed a catapulted paraglide.
Then there was a 100m abseil down the Spinnaker Tower in Portsmouth.
But Trish is no stranger to danger. Husband Peter was a major in the Scots Guards and the couple lived in war zones with their children Sheena and Keith. She added: As an army wife in dangerous places, you knew when danger was real. When you had a gun pointed at you, you knew the bullets were real. During the war between the Greeks and the Turks in Cyprus, they were firing across our childrens primary school. It was terrifying. It was completely out of our control.
Our childrens lives were in danger.
Trish urged other pensioners to swap the sedentary lifestyle for a bit of action. She said: An awful lot of people in their 70s have said to me, I cant do it, Im far too old. I would encourage pensioners to stop saying Im old and get up and do something.

Two alumni members of the Royal College, who are serving as grade heads of St. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia and D. S. Senanayake College Colombo are the resource personnel for the program.
"There were special reasons for us to choose the subject Science for this programme. Science is a crucial subject in the Ordinary Level Exam and secondly, there is a requirement for facilities and technology to learn the subject well.
Bringing these facilities and technology to the students of the Piliyandala area as much as possible, is also an aim of our program said Col.Asanga Perera, the President of the Old Royalist Association Piliyandala.
"As past students of Royal College we were privileged to study under top facilities and teachers and we wanted to share what we gained in our school days with younger generation of Piliyandala area. That was one of the main motives behind this Rajakeeya Shilpa Yaathra programme.
Piliyandala zonal education director and Principal of Royal College, Colombo both have offered their support and blessing in this endeavor," explained Anura Gamage, Program Director of Shilpa Yaathra. B A Abeyratne, the Principal of Royal College Colombo will grace the occasion as chief guest.

Gamage went on to explain that apart from seminar ORAP is in the process of supporting schools, providing physical resources such as libraries, laboratory Sports goods and IT support.
Athula Munasinghe Secretary Royal College Union said that the reason behind the beginning of ORAP were enhancing the bond between Old Royalists in Piliyandala area and uplifting the image of Royal College in Piliyandala area and started the journey with just five members in 2009.
Gamini Wijesinghe, an Old Royalist and teacher brought the concept of establishing ORAP. We also restarted the school bus service between Piliyandala and Royal College.
This year too we have been awarding scholarships for five students annually from schools from Piliyandala area that face economic barriers to continue their studies," said Mahesh Niroshan Ariyaratne, the Secretary of the Old Royalists Association Piliyandala.

Final decision on SAITM to be announced today
President Maithripala Sirisena said the final decision of the government on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) will be announced today.
The solutions were based on the report of committee headed by Deputy Minister Dr.Harsha de Silva.The President said that the responsibility of creating intellectuals to meet the needs of the innovation economy will be lying with the State Universities as well as with the private sector. He also said that all those institutions should safeguard the quality and standards of the education. If the president did not take actions to address these SAITM issues, Dr.Nimal Karunadasa said that they will raise their voice.
They said that the standards of these private medical colleges were poor and the government took measures to get the SAITM students agreed to sit for the national examinations.
The Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) has revealed that SAITM had not received the approval of the University Grants Commission (UGC).
The Deans have emphasised that there must be an opportunity for higher education in Sri Lanka, through both government and the private sectors.
However, they have highlighted that the degree programmes offered by any higher educational institute must follow the requirements of the relevant professional body which in the case of medicine,is the SLMC.

Five-wicket Bishoo puts Windies in control
Bulawayo: Leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo pricked Zimbabwes bubble of optimism on Sunday as his five-wicket haul put the West Indies in charge of the first Test at Queens Sports Club.
Zimbabwe came into the two-match series in a buoyant mood following the return of Brendan Taylor and Kyle Jarvis to their ranks, and carried it through the opening day when they dismissed the West Indies for 219.
But Bishoos 5 for 79 on the second day was like a bucket of cold water on Zimbabwes spirits as they were bowled out for 159, with Hamilton Masakadzas 42 the top score.
There were way too many soft dismissals, and the boys are upset with themselves. That wasnt how we wanted to play, said Zimbabwes batting coach Lance Klusener.
Weve got a second bite at the cherry, but it wont be easy to bat out there.
With Zimbabwe bowled out in just 61.3 overs, the West Indies began their second innings after tea and reached stumps on 88 for one, giving them an overall lead of 148.
Kraigg Brathwaite led the way with an unbeaten 38, while Kyle Hope registered a career-best 32 not out in his fourth Test.
The partnership left Zimbabwe facing a long road back into the game, and with a lingering regret over their batting efforts.
While the turning pitch has provided assistance to the spinners on the opening two days, Zimbabwes batsmen were largely culpable for their own downfall.
The hosts made a positive start in reply to West Indies 219 all out, with openers Masakadza and Solomon Mire moving their overnight total from 19 to 44 without loss.
But an overly adventurous stroke from Mire allowed Kemar Roach to strike, as the debutant was caught on the midwicket boundary for 27.
Mires replacement, Craig Ervine, dug in alongside Masakadza as the pair put on 47 for the second wicket to put Zimbabwe back in control.
But from 91 for one Zimbabwe slipped to 139 for seven as Masakadza felt for a Bishoo delivery and edged behind, Brendan Taylor reverse-swept the legspinner to slip and Sikandar Raza holed out to long-off.
Meanwhile, Sean Williams chased a wide delivery from Roach and was caught behind, before Bishoo completed his five-wicket haul when Regis Chakabva offered a tame catch to backward point.
Shannon Gabriel finished off the innings with the wicket of Chris Mpofu on the stroke of tea, leaving the tourists with a sense of satisfaction. AFP

Grama Shakthi
The big cities and towns usually get all the attention, but the countrys heart really beats in the 10,000 or so villages. In fact, the slogan Gamata Kekiri, Colambata Kiri (Cucumber for villages, milk for cities) popularized by insurgents during the 1988-89 fear psychosis exposed the disparity between the city and the village.
The Grama Shakthi (Strength of the Village) Peoples Movement launched under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on Friday aims to change this scenario and spur development in rural areas.
The Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement, a brainchild of President Sirisena, has especially been designed to alleviate poverty that has become a severe threat to the countrys economy especially the rural economy. This is a timely move, given the importance of rural areas to the Governments multifaceted battle to raise food production and uplift the masses.
Accordingly, the Government plans to uplift 1,000 villages economically under the first phase of the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement. Under the first phase, at least two villages each will be selected from all 332 Divisional Secretariat divisions. Besides, 300 villages which have potential for entrepreneurship, will also be selected to represent the 1,000 villages of the first phase.
The programme has an ambitious road map. Around 1,000 villages will be economically uplifted every year targeting 5,000 villages in a five year period by the Grama Shakthi Peoples Movement. Residents of the 1,000 villages will be granted Rs 250 million to meet their financial needs and Rs 25 million will also be offered to 25 young entrepreneurs. The main aim of the programme is to economically strengthen and empower villagers. There could also be some sort of nexus with the Samurdhi  the Governments poverty alleviation programme.
Significantly, it is not solely a Government initiative. This will avoid the top-down approach that has ruined many previous attempts at rural development which were often designed by bureaucrats confined to A/C rooms in Colombo. This programme will be jointly carried out by many stakeholders such as the state sector, private sector, village community, resource personnel, NGOs, voluntary organisations and civil society movements.
The electoral reforms now underway will lead to a higher level of womens representation and an overall increase in the number of Local Government members elected to Local Bodies. Women active at grassroots level have a better understanding of development needs in their villages. With more Local Government representatives in the fray, there will also be a bigger voice for rural development.
One of the biggest problems in the sphere of rural development is accessibility or rather the lack thereof faced by many remote villages. If you watch news bulletins on local TV, not a day goes by without a news item on a village which does not have a proper access road or bridge. Access roads and bridges must be constructed for villages that are now virtually cut off from the outside world. This will allow residents to take their products to the markets in the city. Rural areas also need better public transport options  some remote routes are served only a single bus all day and villagers have to wait for hours to get to the nearest town.
The main products from rural areas are agricultural. It goes without saying that rural development and agricultural development go hand in hand. The Governments recently introduced agri loan schemes, coupled with the proposed tax and duty cuts on agri vehicles and equipment, could potentially lead to an agricultural revolution. The farmer must be at the centre of any rural development drive.
The Small and Medium Enterprises (SME) sector is also very important for rural development and the Government has pledged to take cognizance of this factor in the Budget 2018 which will be presented on November 9. Most SME projects are located in rural areas, but the entrepreneurs often lack technical and marketing know-how. If this lacuna can be addressed, the SME sector can make a more vibrant contribution to the overall economy.
Developing rural health and education facilities should be a priority. The Government has already embarked on a drive to fully equip all rural hospitals and the Nearest School is the Best School project aims to develop rural schools to the level of schools in the cities. Education is recognised by the United Nations as the best weapon against poverty as an educationally empowered generation will be able to initiate or secure employment.
It has been observed that many villagers are not in the formal banking system due to the lack of knowledge. Some banks have mobile units that go to the doorstep of rural residents to offer banking services, but there should be a wider drive to get more rural residents into the banking structure through innovative programmes.
Preventing migration to the cities as well as retaining the younger generation in vocations such as farming are also essential to spur rural development. It is thus essential to create more economic opportunities in rural areas themselves without depending on a city-centric economy. A holistic approach to rural development is a must.

Hamilton blasts to U.S. Grand Prix pole
AUSTIN, Texas, Saturday: Lewis Hamilton pulverised the track record to claim pole position on Saturday ahead of a U.S. Grand Prix that could secure the Mercedes drivers fourth Formula One world championship. Ferraris Sebastian Vettel, the Britons closest rival but 59 points behind with four races remaining, qualified second with a prodigious effort just when it seemed Mercedes would sweep the front row.
Hamilton, chasing his fifth win in six years at the Circuit of the Americas, dominated every phase of qualifying and will be champion on Sunday if he scores 16 points more than the German.
I love this track, it is such a fantastic track to drive, he said. Its going to be a great race, a tough one, but Im the best prepared I can be.
Vettel is the only other driver to have won at the Texas track and will do everything he can to deny the Briton a 62nd victory but will also be haunted by two retirements in the last three races.
Hamiltons pole, in a time of one minute 33.108 seconds on a gusty afternoon, was the 72nd of his career and 11th of the season.
It also allowed him to claim another of Michael Schumachers all-time Formula One records with an unprecedented 117th front row start.
While Mercedes look sure to clinch the constructors championship for the fourth year in a row on Sunday, with a 145-point advantage over Ferrari, Hamilton played down his own chances of wrapping things up in America. I think its highly unlikely thats going to be the case, the 32-year-old told the cheering crowd from the pit straight after parking up.
Sebastian did a great job today to bring the Ferrari back up there. I think ultimately all I can do is do the best I can of my abilities and we are going to work as hard as I can to get maximum points. Sebastian is right there so unless he makes a silly mistake, which is unlikely as hes a four-times world champion, then we are going to be seeing it (the battle) continue on to other races.
Vettels time of 1:33.347 put him ahead of Hamiltons team mate Valtteri Bottas, who qualified third and shares the second row with Red Bulls Australian Daniel Ricciardo.
My lap was very poor in Q3 (the third phase) and I knew I had to deliver, said the German, whose mechanics changed the cars chassis after he complained about the handling in a fraught Friday practice.
I got it right when it mattered at the end. Its important to get the front row because I believe our race pace is really good.
Ferraris Kimi Raikkonen qualified fifth with Max Verstappen sixth for Red Bull, but the Dutch 20-year-old has a 15-place grid penalty meaning French driver Esteban Ocon moves up to the third row for Force India.
Spains Carlos Sainz, preparing for his first race for Renault after switching from Toro Rosso, will start seventh alongside compatriot Fernando Alonso in the McLaren.  Agencies

Here are the health benefits of eating wheat pasta
With more gluten-free diets becoming fashionable, together with a lack of genuine understanding of the subject, many people have started to question how healthy wheat pasta really is.
The only secret to healthy and awesome food combination is a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fat and fibre!
One such meal from the Mediterranean diet is Pasta- which is delicious and fairly easy to prepare.
Rajneesh Bhasin, MD, Borges India says, pasta provides energy and essential nutrients in the form of fiber, vitamins and minerals. What better than filling your tummy with a platter of mouth watering pasta! While we are frequently burdened with health advice that pastas arent healthy, one single meal of pasta (100g) is loaded with 12.5 g protein and 2.5 g fibre while whole wheat pastas are loaded with 3.5 to 4 times the fibre of regular durum wheat pastas.
The research, published in Nutrition and Diabetes, indicates that pasta consumption doesnt contribute to obesity, and was actually linked to a lower body mass index (BMI) because it known to be a part of a healthy Mediterranean diet people across the globe aspire to adopt. Well, it is important to know that own it doesnt raise cholesterol, it contains no unhealthy fats and it is good source of the carbohydrates and nutrients we need for our body to work properly. Your aim should be to increase your energy expenditure while cutting down the amount of fat you eat, which will come from the accompanying ingredients rather than the pasta itself.
Bhasin further stated, wheat has been a staple foodstuff for humans for centuries, but of late refined wheat flour (maida) has taken up dominant position in our daily diets in the form of bread, noodles and other products. It is mostly due to its ease in conversion to different shapes, better shelf life and reduced price even though we know that refined flour (maida) is difficult to digest and is known to increase insulin levels in blood over a period of time. With this growing awareness and health concern with respect to refined flours, we are seeing a switch to whole wheat products. These health concerns coupled with good taste are easily addressed with nutritious products like whole wheat pasta.
Whole wheat pasta is made up from whole durum wheat semolina which contains all the parts of a wheat grain i.e bran, germ, endosperm unlike refined flours which contains only endosperm which erodes major fibre and protein boosters in the form of bran and germ. In fact, most Indians are aware of the fact that it is the bran which has the major portion of fiber and protein due to the lineage and knowledge about wheat farming and grounding process. And cooking pasta al dente reduces its glycemic index, which cuts out any sugar rush. Several studies have also shown that  cup serving of whole wheat pasta can reduce the risk of chronic health conditions like cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, cancer, digestive issues.
Even though many of us are already aware about the health benefits of whole wheat pasta, we are apprehensive about introducing it in our daily lives due to the inhibition about its taste and pasta experience it is meant to deliver. ANI

HNB slashed rates on  personal finance products ahead of festive season
In a continuing effort to partner its clients and support them to achieve their aspirations, Sri Lankas leading retail bank, HNB PLC, announced that it would be reducing interest rates on all of its core personal financial products  spanning leasing, housing and personal loans.
Over the recent past we have witnessed significant demand for loans, particularly in the demographic of young professionals, many of who are seeking to buy a car, start a home, for professional studies or for any other investment activity, as these are important landmarks in our customers lives and we want to do our part to make them a reality.
At HNB we are committed in supporting our clients to achieve their dreams, and serve as a true partner in their journey to greater prosperity. Hence, when we saw an opportunity to pass on the benefits of current macroeconomic conditions to our customers we decided to move quickly to ensure that all of our customers gain from current market dynamics, HNB Head of Personal Financial Services Viraj Mendis said.
The bank currently offers up to 70% of the total market value as a loan on registered vehicles and 50% of the market value on new vehicles. Following the rate cut, interest rates on Personal Financial Service products will start as low as from 13.25% for professional category, for housing purposes.
He added that Sri Lankas increasing affluence was also beginning to be demonstrated through increased demand for personal loans aimed at funding education and international travel, which the rate cut from HNB, is ideally timed to facilitate.
At this time of the year, many foreign universities start to open up applications; hence we tend to receive even greater applications for education loans. Similarly, travel loans also tend to spike towards the end of the year, with travel companies often offering discounts for pre-booking targeting the first and second quarters of 2018, Viraj Mendis explained.
He further noted that HNB will continue to offer these loans on fixed or floating rates, depending on the requirements and preference of each customer while further discounts and special rates would be rolled out to customers in the coming months as part of the banks festive season campaigns. Further discounts are also available to HNBs Shanthi Housing Loyalty Cardholders from over 60 + selected merchants.

Huawei, Telefnica  launch worlds first 5G-oriented  antenna deployment solution
At the 2017 Global Antenna Technology & Industry Forum recently held in Munich, Huawei partnered with Telefnica Deutschland to launch the world's first 5G-oriented antenna deployment solution. During the evolution to 5G, this solution can resolve the challenge of insufficient antenna installation space for the deployment of both high-band 4T4R over Sub 3 GHz and Massive MIMO.
Insufficient antenna installation space has emerged as an evident issue of network deployment during the evolution from 4G to 4.5G/5G. As 700 MHz, 1400 MHz and other new spectrums are distributed, full bands 4T4R has emerged as a mainstream configuration. Simple overlay can hardly meet deployment requirements. Additionally, operators are expected to reserve antenna installation space for Massive MIMO to implement a smooth evolution. As a result, a single antenna that integrates all Sub 3 GHz bands and reserves space for Massive MIMO is set to be a typical antenna solution for 5G.
Huawei and Telefnica Deutschland jointly release 5G-oriented antenna deployment solution, which incorporates both a 14-port multi-band antenna and a TDD 3.5 GHz Massive MIMO antenna to meet Telefnica's requirements for an easy network evolution towards 5G.
Jaime Lluch, Radio Access Network Director in Telefnica Deutschland indicated that, Telefnica is a top global telecom operator committed to deliver an optimal network experience. We believe that during the future-oriented network evolution of MBB, antenna installation space severely hinders the progress of network deployment. Telefnica Deutschland and Huawei's 5G-oriented antenna deployment solution can address the challenge of insufficient space, while ensuring excellent network performance and capacity.
Based on many years of technical accumulation in wireless networks and an in-depth understanding of MBB network, Huawei cooperates with Telefnica Deutschland to release the world's first 5G-oriented antenna deployment solution. This innovative solution can help operators to overcome the obstacles of 5G network deployment and potentially further help to achieve new business success.

Incredible Malala
Its October 9, 2012. A masked gunman boards her school bus and demands, Who is Malala Coarse and full of hate, the man points his merciless weapon at the defenseless 15 year old girl who covers her face in response, and without feeling, he opens fire.
Malala Yousafzai was then a soft but strong voice against the Taliban militants who wished to shatter the education of young girls in Swat Valley in north-west Pakistan. Malala wrote an anonymous diary on BBC Urdu about life under Taliban rule and the radicals attempted to stifle her voice, but without success.
Malala survived the attack. At the time, she was already well-known in Pakistan but the shock of the malicious attack brought her to international fame. In 2014 she became the youngest person ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
I have never seen Malala cry. She is incredibly stoical, says Dr. Fiona Reynolds, the Birmingham doctor who treated Malala after she was shot in the head. When she had to undergo painful treatment she didnt wince, she didnt cry, she didnt even squeeze my hand, she added. While crying is by no means a sign of weakness, Malala seemed to have no tears to shed at the face of death.
In Peshawar her father had been told by the Pakistani doctors, before I arrived, to pray for her and he took it to mean she was dying and he started to make preparations for her funeral, she said.
But Malala had no intention of giving up. In an interview with ABC news, she says, I didnt cry because I totally changed after that incident. I was feeling that this is a new life, she said. Last week, she began her studies at the University of Oxford. five years ago, I was shot in an attempt to stop me from speaking out for girls education, she wrote on her Twitter. Today, I attend my first lectures at Oxford.
Early Life
Malala was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District, often called the Switzerland of Asia, of Pakistans northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province into a lower-middle-class family to Ziauddin Yousafzai and Tor Pekai Yousafzai. Her family is a Sunni Muslim family. She was given her first name Malala (meaning grief-stricken) after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan. At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers Khushal and Atal.
Malala was educated mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai who is a school owner, running a chain of schools known as the Khushal Public School. She once stated to an interviewer that she would like to become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead. Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.
Life under Taliban
But the wish of her father and her own was shaken when Swat Valley became Taliban Territory in 2007. According to New York Times documentary Class Dismissed: The Death of Female Education, more than 200 schools for girls had been blown up by the Taliban while boys schools remained open.
In January 2009, Malala writes in her diary under pen name Gul Makai Since today was the last day of our school, we decided to play in the playground a bit longer. I am of the view that the school will one day reopen but while leaving I looked at the building as if I would not come here again, But amidst of threats from Taliban, she dared to go to school.
Malala, the activist
When in late 2008, Ziauddin Yousafzai was asked by the BBC Urdu to suggest a schoolgirl from Swat to write an anonymous diary on the web as a way of covering Talibans growing influence in the district, he could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala.
As her voice grew louder, her will stronger, the Taliban attacked her in an attempt to murder the fifteen year old girl.
With her survival, she got the opportunity to speak for thousands of girls across the world.
In 2013, determined to continue their campaign for girls education, Malala and Ziauddin set up Malala Fund, an organisation dedicated to give all girls access to education.
Over the next few years, Malala meets with girls around the world and many heads of state, carrying her message of girls education and equality.
Throughout the later years, she occupies herself in order to support girls like herself who go through horrendous suffering across the globe and in April 2017, Malala embarks on a six-month Girl Power Trip with stops in North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America to meet girls, hear about the challenges they face and fight for their right to go to school.
In 2013, she was named one of TIME magazines most influential people and was first nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
The same year, she won the European Parliaments Sakharov price for Freedom of Thought and released her autobiography I Am Malala.
Malala currently resides in Birmingham, England, with her family, and according to DW.com, she could be targeted once again if she decides to return to Swat. Karachi-based journalist and documentary filmmaker Sabin Agha told the website that Girls like Malala symbolize defiance, and there are many in Pakistan who dont like that, especially if it comes from a female.
According to the website, despite the fact that liberals hail Malala as a symbol of pride for the country, she has become an extremely divisive figure in Pakistan.
A majority of conservatives alleges she is working against Islam and Pakistans sovereignty.
Malala has been portrayed as a western agent in Pakistan - a country brimming with anti-West sentiment. Anyone seen as pro-West in the country becomes a target for scorn, ridicule, hatred, and even violence, DW reports, adding that the countrys progressive section was too weak and fragmented to ensure Malalas safety.
And so she stands with thousands of girls, stands by them as a loving companion. And she stands tall at the face of militants, doubters and haters. With her voice, she softly but firmly answers them: I am Malala.

Japanese Prime Minister Abe wins big in national elections

Japan's leader has scored a major victory in national elections that returned his ruling coalition to power in decisive fashion.
Japanese media said Monday that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's LiberalDemocratic Partyand a small coalition partner had together secured at least 312 seats in the 465-seat lower house of parliament, passing the 310-barrier for a two-thirds majority. Four seats remained undecided.
The victory boosts Abe's chances of winning another three-year term next September as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party. That could extend his premiership to 2021, giving him more time to try to win a reluctant public over to his longtime goal of revising Japan's pacifist constitution.
In the immediate term, the win likely means a continuation of the policies Abe has pursued since he took office in December 2012  a hard line onNorth Korea, close ties with Washington, including defense, as well as a super-loose monetary policy and push for nuclear energy. Stocks rose in Tokyo on Monday morning.
Abe's ruling coalition already has a two-thirds majority in the less powerful upper house. Having a so-called supermajority in both houses gives them virtually a free hand to push even divisive policies and legislation.
Abe said the results indicate that voters support his policies and want to see his political leadership continue.
"I think the results reflected the voters' preference for a solid political foundation and their expectations for us to push polices forward and achieve results," Abe told NHK.
With the win, Abe has bounced back from the summer, when his support ratings plunged to 30 percent after accusations of government favoritism to people connected to him. For the first time since he took office nearly five years ago, he appeared vulnerable as both party leader and prime minister.
The ruling coalition's victory, though, reflects as much the lack of viable alternatives as support for Abe, a fact that he seemed to acknowledge in post-election comments. Turnout was just 54 percent, as typhoon rains lashed much of the country.
"I will humbly face the victory and continue to work humbly and sincerely," he told NHK, noting lingering public distrust over the scandals.
Abe dissolved the lower house less than a month ago, forcing the snap election. Analysts saw it as an attempt to solidify his political standing at a time when the opposition was in disarray and his support ratings had improved somewhat.
His plan was briefly upstaged by the launch of a new opposition party by populist Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike. But initial excitement faded, and the Party of Hope took only 49 seats.
Another new party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, won 54 seats and looks to be the biggest opposition grouping. It is liberal-leaning, while both the Party of Hope and Abe's Liberal Democratic Party are more conservative.
Koike called the results "very severe" in a televised interview from Paris, where she is attending a conference of mayors. She said some of her remarks might have been taken negatively by voters, and that she would take the blame.
Abe's party and its nationalist supporters have advocated constitutional revisions for years. They view the 1947 constitution as the legacy of Japan's defeat inWorld War II and an imposition of the victor's world order and values. The charter renounces the use of force in international conflicts and limits Japan's troops to self-defense, although Japan has a well-equipped modern military that works closely with the U.S.
Any change to Japan's constitution, which has never been amended, requires approval first by two-thirds of parliament, and then in a public referendum. Polls indicate that the Japanese public remains opposed to amendment.

Kandy Sports Club pulled off a creditable 44 points to 14 win over Singapore before a poor crowd at Nittawela on Saturday. At half time the winners led 27-7. The 44 points for Kandy came off 4 goals, 2 tries and 2 penalty kicks at goal to 14 points (2 goals).
The Singapore team had more overseas players than locals. Fazil Marija and the rest of the three-quarters did well to keep a hand on the ball and put the Singaporeans on the back foot. What the Kandy SC side did in this game was superb, they stuck to their plan, playing brilliant rugby.
Scorers for Kandy were Fazil Marija (two) and one each from Richard Dharmapala, Anurudda Wilwara, Dhanushka Ranjan and Nigel Ratwatte. Of four goals Ratwatte and Arshad Jamaldeen kicked one each. For the losers Johnson Darber and Peter Williams scored a try each and the goal kicking came off the boot of Johnson Darber.

Kaspersky Lab presents 2018 version
Kaspersky Lab together with Avian Technologies presents Kaspersky Internet Security 2018 version with Multi Device Protection.
The make-up of the modern home is changing, bringing with it a new era of household, which on average, cares for 2.4 people[i], 0.3 pets[ii] and now also 6.3[iii] connected devices per home. With devices playing such a prominent role in todays average home, Kaspersky Lab launched the updated versions of Kaspersky Internet Security, to help people care for their devices as much as they care for their pets and those living under their roofs.
The launch for Sri Lanka took place recently with Avian Technologies, sole distributor for Kaspersky in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
Altaf Halde, Managing Director, South Asia said, Our new versions of Kaspersky Internet Security is taking forward our commitment to keep our users safe and secure. Kaspersky Internet Security delivers award-winning, easy-to-use security technologies  to help you protect your PC, Mac and Android phone and tablet against the very latest viruses, attacks, spyware, cybercrime and more.
Commenting at the launch, Directors Ranil Francisco and Buddhika Liyanage said, Avians journey with Kaspersky has been empowering and successful. With our goal to maintain the most robust, reliable services and solutions for the industry, Avian Technologies has unique offering such as a 24/7 hotline for professional sales and technical support, and a distribution network of over 300 re-sellers island-wide. The launch of the 2018 version is yet another milestone for us.
The average household today spends a huge part of its awake hours online, and the more people surf the web, the greater their risk of falling victim to a malicious program or website. Addressing this concern, Kaspersky Internet Security includes anti-phishing technology to prevent users from falling victim to fake or spam emails, fake websites and fraud.
In addition, connected households also worry about losing the information thats stored on their devices, with photos being the most precious forms of data. In fact, Kaspersky Lab research has found that for many, the loss of their digital photos is more stressful than a breakup with a partner or a pets illness.Because their data is so precious to them, 56% of Internet users are concerned about the prospect of having their data held at ransom, concerns that are expected to rise following the recent WannaCry epidemic.The Kaspersky Internet Security includes the companys anti-ransomware feature, which has been updated to fight even the most complicated ransomware.
Another addition,the App Lock feature for Androidoffers an extra layer of protection with a secret code for users to prevent specific apps like instant messaging services, social media, email, and other confidential information from being seen by others when they are accessing a users phone.
Users can also benefit from the Kaspersky Secure Connection service, integrated with Kaspersky Internet Security, which encrypts all user traffic when using insecure Wi-Fi or sensitive websites. Vulnerable family members, children, are increasingly connected to the Internet.
Developers at Kaspersky Lab have thus included the companys renowned parental controls in the latest version.
These allow parents to specify time limits for specific devices in the household, restrict the applications children can use and prevent access to pages with adult content, obscene language or information about drugs, and more, all within the Kaspersky Safe Kids service.

Know your heart
This week Consultant Clinical and Interventional Cardiologist Dr.Mohan Jayatilake (MD, MRCP) speak about Coronary Angiogram, a medical procedure that can be done to diagnose various heart problems.
Q- What is coronary angiogram
A - An angiogram is an x-ray test that uses a special dye and camera (fluroscopy) to take a picture of the blood flow in coronary arteries which supply blood to the heart muscles.
This is carried out in a specially designed lab called cardiac catheterisation lab. A coronary angiogram is the gold standard for the evaluation of coronary arteries therefore it is highly accurate.
Q- How is a coronary angiogram performed
A - It is performed with the use of a small catheter which is 2-3mm in diameter through the artery near the groin or arm. A local anaesthetic is used to numb the skin prior to insertion of catheter.
It is guided through the artery with the assistance of a fluoroscope (x-ray camera) and advanced to the opening of coronary arteries. Next step is to inject a small amount of radiographic dye into the arteries to visualise any blockages. The images produced are called the angiogram. After the procedure the catheter is removed and bleeding is prevented by manual compression.
This procedure even though not painful can be somewhat uncomfortable.
Q- How do patients qualify for such a procedure
A - A coronary angiogram should be performed in the following situations:
a- chest pain on exertion,
b- after a heart attack,
c- positive stress test
d- heart valve problem that requires surgery.
Coronary artery blockage on angiogram
There is no hard and fast rule regarding the age limit and all decisions are taken after a lengthy discussion with patients and relatives depending on the underlying heart disease as well as other comorbidities of the patient.
However there is always an increased risk of complications during an invasive procedure in the elderly compared to the younger patients. Therefore for patients above 85 years unless the patient is severely symptomatic and not responding to medical therapy, routinely coronary angiograms are not performed.
There is no definite number of attempts for coronary angiogram as it is a diagnostic procedure and will be performed only if clinically indicated. This is not a screening test for heart disease.
Q- Are there any risks involved
A- Coronary angiograms are generally considered to be safe. However as with all medical procedures there are some risks involved.These include:
i. Bleeding under the skin at the wound site (heamatoma). This will improve after a few days
ii. Bruising- it is common to have a bruise in your arm or groin for a few days after
iii. Allergic reaction to the dye used causing symptoms such as rash, headache, chills/rigors
iv. Anaphylactic reaction is rare
serious complications which are very rare include
i. Damage to the artery in the arm or groin in which the catheter was inserted
ii. Heart attack
iii. Stroke
iv. Impairment of Kidney function - If kidneys are normal prior to procedure it is highly unlikely to have contrast induced kidney failure. However in patients with pre-existing kidney disease a special type of dye or a specific treatment programme prior to angiogram is used.
v. Plaque rupture causing death
Cardiologist will discuss all risks and benefits of this procedure preceding it.
Q- Is there any risk of undergoing an Angiogram forDiabetic patients and those who havehigh blood pressure
A - In patients with diabetes or high blood pressure a coronary angiogram can definitely be performed if they still have the same indications such as angina, myocardial infarction, positive stress test. However it is never used as a screening tool to predict coronary artery disease. There is no risk difference in these patients in undergoing an angiogram compared to any other person. Yet adequate diabetic control and management of high blood pressure is vital for long term survival.
Q - What if a person who is required to undergo an angiogram does not like to do so What are the other options available
A - A Magnetic Resonance Angiogram (MRA) or Coronary Angiographic CT scan may be another option if the patient is reluctant to have an angiogram. These tests are less invasive than a standard angiogram. Most MRA tests and all CTA require injection of dye and CTA also involves exposure to radiation. Even if there was a significant abnormality found in a MRA or CTA, a coronary angiogram is still indicated as a confirmatory diagnostic procedure.
SPECT (Single- Photon Emission Computed Tomography) is a nuclear imaging test which uses a radioactive substance and able to provide 3D images. It is not widely available in Sri Lanka and only available in limited hospitals. SPECT is not used as a diagnostic tool while the gold standard is a coronary angiogram.

Lack of sleep tied to gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes - abnormally high blood sugar that develops during pregnancy, can lead to excessive birth weight, preterm birth or respiratory distress in the baby, among other problems. It can also increase the mothers risk for Type 2 diabetes later in life.
Researchers pooled data from eight studies involving 17,595 women. Seven of the studies depended on self-reports of sleep, and one measured sleep duration. After adjusting for variables such as age, body mass index and ethnicity, they found that women who slept less than 6.25 hours a night were almost three times as likely to have gestational diabetes as those who slept more.
The reasons for the link are not known, but the authors suggest that hormonal changes in pregnancy as well as systematic inflammation tied to lack of sleep can lead to insulin resistance and high blood glucose levels. But the study is observational and does not prove a causal relationship between poor sleep and gestational diabetes.
Minimizing sleep disruption is important  limiting caffeine, avoiding electronics at bedtime and so on, said the lead author, Dr. Sirimon Reutrakul, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago. - nytimes.com

Fifth and final ODI at Sharjah today
Lanka hopes to avoid whitewash by arresting run famine
SHARJAH, Sunday:<U+0B9A> Sri Lanka will attempt to arrest the run famine by their batsmen that has placed them in a position for another 5-0 whitewash of a one-day series when they face Pakistan in the fifth and final match at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium on Monday.
The failure of the batsmen to regulate the strike constantly and build up partnerships has been the biggest problem facing Sri Lanka in the second shortest format and seen them commit the cardinal sin (in ODI cricket) of not lasting their quota of fifty overs.
It is pretty obvious. It is not rocket science. We just want the batters to be a little more positive about the way they go about things. We also understand we need to be in the right mental frame of mind to be there. So our job is to try and give the players the freedom to be able to play their way, said interim head coach Nic Pothas as the pre-match press conference.
It is going to be a very good wicket again and it is not the biggest boundary in the world. So we are always looking to just improving. From the batting point of view theres nothing different to what we have been saying all along. Batters always play better when it is positive. Their decision making is better, feet movement will be better and there will be intent to score if you stay in a positive mind. It has been the same message all the way through. Execution is the toughest part so hopefully we can go and execute that a little bit better, he said.
In each of the previous four ODIs only one batsman has stood out alone with no support from the rest of the batters. In the first and fourth ODIs it was Lahiru Thirimanne who scored a fifty apiece and in the second and third ODIs skipper Upul Tharanga with a century and a half century. The rest of the batsmen have hardly done any justice to their positions although the line up consists of potential scorers like Dinesh Chandimal the Test captain, Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis who has lost his place in the side to newcomer Sadeera Samarawickrama.
It is disappointing but we are also playing a different Pakistan team. You have to take that into account. Their Test squad is in transition as they lost three legends of the game. We certainly know what that feels like, said Pothas.
We are building a Test team so we are very happy with the result of the Test team but the One day team - the Pakistan team are Champions trophy winners, they are on a roll. They are playing good one-day cricket and they got their formula down. So they can wake up at 3o clock in the morning and their team and go and execute their roles and execute their skills. They are in a very good place. We probably know we are in different place. As much as it is disappointing it is also unstable.
I dont think we can call this a young team. We have some very senior guys in the side who have handled a lot of one-day cricket. It is a tough chance to go back and reflect on the last two ODI series the Indian one and this one here. When you keep losing something has to change, he said.
Pothas agreed with Pakistan captain Sarfraz Ahmeds view that Pakistan has the best bowling attack in the world.
Hundred per cent I agree with that. As I say you can put new guys on the field and they know what they are doing. When a team is winning, its pretty easy to bring new players into their team because there is a good culture, there is a confident culture, said Pothas.
It is pretty easy to just drop people into that kind of environment. It is not easy when you are not winning. So they certainly do have one of the best bowling line-ups in the world. You cant argue with results and argue with numbers.
POTHAS JUSTIFIES DECISION TO SKIP LAHORE
Pothas said that his decision not to travel to Lahore for the third T20I against Pakistan was based on a family decision.
It was a family decision. My family is not very happy about me going. For me my family comes first, said Pothas. Everyone gets a chance to make their own decisions. No one should be forced to do anything that they are not comfortable with. It was not an easy decision to make. It has to be respected, he added.
Some Pakistani media earlier today reminded me that several South Africans had gone to Lahore last month for the World XI games. It was their decision. Their decision doesnt influence my decision. Ideally the Board wanted everyone to go. But no one pressurised me to do anything, said Pothas.
Pothas, however, is expected to stay behind with the team for the first two T20Is in Abu Dhabi and someone within the coaching staff is expected to take charge for the final game.
Fast bowling coach Rumesh Ratnayake who had a brief stint as Sri Lankas head coach in 2011 and former captain and current batting coach Hashan Tillakaratne are the front runners for the post.
DISAPPOINTED IF WE DONT WIN 5-0 - ARTHUR
Pakistans South African coach Mickey Arthur said that he would be disappointed if Pakistan didnt make a clean 5-0 sweep of the series.
The guys are hungry and the guys want to definitely do that, said Arthur who is thrilled by the performance the Pakistani youngsters have come up with.
When we are winning and winning well and we get a young guy who a year ago wasnt in our team and is suddenly the No.1 bowler in the world (Hasan Ali) and also Babar Azam has moved to No. 4 in the world. (Mohammad) Hafeez has gone back to No.1 in the brisk form of the game. That is a great compliment to those players. That also shows we have started to gel as a really good one-day unit, said Arthur.
The Pakistani coach expressed disappointment that Hafeez has been reported for his bowling action but was confident that he will come through.
That is disappointing because he is such an integral part of this one-day side going forward in terms of what he brings with the ball particularly in these conditions. We spent the last couple of days going back on few videos and the stuff when he came back and we are confident that he is fine. I am pretty sure he is going get through that problem, said Arthur.

Lanka to muster all-time tea export revenue  target of Rs 1.5 bn this year
Sri Lanka will achieve an all-time tea export revenue target this year said, Chairman of TEA Jayantha Karunaratne.
He said that the current export revenue was around Rs. 1.2 billion and this was the figure of last year.
We expect this figure to move up to the Rs 1.5 billion mark by the end of the year which would be a record amount. The total production of tea in 2016 accounted for 292.57 million kg where 288.77 million kg was exported. However, in comparison to 2015 the numbers have shown 11% decline, as the total tea production accounted for 2015 was 328 million kg while tea exports the same year remained at 306.96 million kg. Tea production for the period January  August 2017 has totaled 206.9 million kg vis--vis 199.0 million kg of January  August 2016, showing a gain of 7.9 million kg.
Sri Lanka is the 4th largest tea producer in the world. China, which tops the list, produces 2.2 billion kg of tea while India and Kenya produce 1.2 billion kg and 400 million kg respectively. Sri Lanka produces 330 million kg. Conversely, Sri Lanka is the 3rd largest tea exporter in the world, where its exports account for 300 million kg. Kenya is on the lead exporting 380 million kg, while China follows closely with 320 million kg. (SS)

Let alone a new Constitution, even a Constitutional Bill had been formulated up to now. The Steering Committee report included features like the nature of the state, devolution of power, the Executive Presidency, the system of the Prime Minister, system of elections and other ideas and views. When it was debated it may crate understanding as well as various other views the Prime Minitser said.
A Constitution should be formulated in a manner that would protect the unitary status of the country, unite all communities, give pride of place to Buddhism and create a background for Sinhala Buddhists as well as others to live without fear or suspicion, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added. The Prime Minister said the President and he would never act without the agreement and approval of the people.

Malwatte, Asgiriya Chapters to announce common stand
The common stand of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters on the new Constitution will be announced after the members of the Karaka Sangha Sabhas of the two Chapters have discussions with the Malwatte and Asgiriya Chief Prelates on their return from abroad, said Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Anunayake Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter.
Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Anunayake Thera said the subject had already been discussed by members of the two Karaka Maha Sangha Sabhas.
Ven. Dhammadassi Anunayake Thera was speaking at a ceremony held at the Pitiyegedara Rajamaha Viharaya, Wattegama on October 20.
The Anunayake Thera said the country today is witnessing a rare opportunity where the two main parties had come together to form a national government. Every one should try to introduce a lasting common national policy which would not change with the change of governments in future.
The Anunayake Thera said problems should be resolved through dialogue. Therefore, the background should be prepared to protect and safeguard Sinhala Buddhists and members of other communities and strengthen religious harmony in the country. Despite opposition, the country needed Expressways and as such, work should go ahead by resolving the issues raised by opponents. In addition to the Central Expressway, more Expressways should be added to the countrys road network, the Anunayake Thera said.

The Navy rescued seven Indian sailors from an Indian merchant vessel sinking in Sri Lankan seas about 68 nautical miles south of the Galle Light House and brought them to the Galle Harbour on Saturday morning.
The Maldives bound medium-scale merchant vessel Maria Murudaya was sinking in sea south of Sri Lanka a few days back and the Maldivian Government informed the incident to the Sri Lanka Navy.
The Sri Lanka Navy Head Quarters alerted all international merchant vessels sailing in that region including navy ships and craft patrolling in Southern seas to assist in rescue operation.
On Friday (20) evening, the Navy received information about a drifting life-craft with sailors on board from a multi-day fishing trawler, Sahana Putha and dispatched their Fast Attack Craft P 490 to the location. The Indian crew was rescued and brought safely to the Galle Harbour. They were in good health and handed over to the Indian High Commission through the Hambantota Indian Consulate for repatriation.

Nostalgic notes
Her name is among some of the greatest musicians in the world. For someone who had benefited from the program initiated by the Princess Grace of Monaco which allowed talented children to receive music lessons Shani Diluka has come far on a less trodden path to set her mark in the global music arena. Applause, awards and prizes, she has won all these by excelling in piano forte. Music has also found her the perfect partner in Gabriel Le Magadure, an award winning French violinist who is a part of a very famous classical quartet called Quatuor Ebene.
Shani the musician vs Shani the wife
Shani is a person who is always curious and very open to the world. She is passionate in her personal life as well as with her music. I think she is the same on stage and in life: generous and always looking into the best of everything. That is why she has become one of the greatest pianist of her generation, performing all over the world - in Japan, Russia, Germany, Italy, Austria, etc. , collaborating with great people and passionate about sharing her art.
The meeting
We met in Bilbao for the first time and then in Tokyo. Then we realized we lived in Paris almost on the same street! It was kind of love at the first sight and after playing in the same festivals in Spain and Japan in 2007, we were drawn to each other. Our love story began in that manner. That was exactly 10 years ago.
First date
Our first date was on border of the sea, on the beach of the Costa Brava in Spain. We were watching the sunrise and it was so romantic. I proposed to Shani to get married on the same place three years later. Our first trip was in the desert in Egypt in Siwa Oasis. It was a very special place with a great and contemplative atmosphere. We love travelling and discovering new cultures.
Tying the knot
I proposed her on the beach, exactly on the rock where we first kissed. I surprised her by taking her there and I was waiting for the sunrise again to ask her to marry me. Actually, I came there a bit too early before the sunrise, and we waited for a long time in the dark. Then the sun came up, and of course she said, YES!! We were so excited!
Then we got married in my home town, Brittany. There was a very nice castle on the coast of Brittany. We also had a very big wedding in Paris. We had friends coming from all over the world for this occasion: India, Japan, Germany, England, etc. It was very special as the cuisine with a Michelin three star chef. The menu as inspired by the French cuisine and spices from Sri Lanka. We did this to make a connection between our cultures. This day was like a dream Shani was wearing saree and I was wearing a suit. We also had a wedding in Sri Lanka. I wore a salwar kameez for that! I loved it!
Greatest strength and greatest weakness
Her greatest strength would be that she is hard working, curious, always positive and very creative. Her weakness would be feeling lonely sometimes because she has to travel a lot and not sharing enough time with the one she loves. She is always caring and helpful. She is very passionate in everything she does but at the same time she doesnt know how to stop! However, I am also like that.
Favourite musical piece from all of her compositions (SUB HEAD)
Shani plays great composers and did so many recordings. I would say my favorite CD is the Schubert which she plays with so much deepness, because its very dreamy and profound. She has a unique touch in the tune when she plays it. She has a very special sound on the piano. Everybody says that.
Most memorable performance
The first time I listened to her was in Tokyo at the great Festival Folle journe. I remember I cried even though I did not know her well. That was my first impression as an artiste. Then I listened to her performance once we became a couple at the La Roque dAntheron Festival. That is the greatest piano festival in the world with more than 2000 seats in the theatre. That was impressive as she had a full house. The event was a huge success. That was the day I met her wonderful father. So these are the concerts I will never forget. Of course, there many others and I was unable to attend many since we travel both so much. But of course, we play together sometimes and playing together is always so special. We love it! We perform each year in Sri Lanka. That is also very special for both if us. Every time is unforgettable.
Other passions
Shani writes poetry and she will be releasing her first book next spring. We are all very excited about it. She loves reading and going to the cinema. Both of us share the love of good food and good wine. I am passionate about sports. I do a lot of yoga and swimming. I love watching any kind of sports especially football.
Bonding over tunes
Music is, of course, a very strong bonding between us. More than that, it is our way of looking at the world which united us. We love to share moments with our family and friends. We love inviting people and we try to be generous as possible, giving our time and donating every day as much as we can to help needy people.
We are very strong as a couple because of the values we share and we are also very open to the world. We love to discuss about politics or social topics. We try to be responsible as citizens as well as musicians. We love meeting people, going to the theater or concerts, museum, exhibitions. We adore art and culture. All these values and passions make our bond stronger every day even if we do not meet each other so often. Generally we are 10 days together in a month since we travel all the time because of our concert tours.
Favourite holiday destination
I would say that our favourite holiday destination is Sri Lanka! We love Sri Lanka and I in particular love it so much! I am very close to Shanis family and to the culture. We also love to go to Japan where we are invited almost every year to perform. Thats why we chose Japan for our honeymoon! It is a fascinating country, very Asian, sophisticated and Buddhist in spirit.
Animal lovers
We love animals so much! In fact, we had three dogs for a while: Chico, Tyla and Lilou who are Shanis family dogs. Unfortunately with our way of life, travelling so much, being never at home, it is almost impossible to have pets. We love those three like babies! That is also something we love in Sri Lankans: respecting nature and animals. That is so important.
Foodies
We love every kind of food, but our favourites are Japanese, Sri Lankan, Indian and Italian.
Shani loves cooking and she gives her attention to almost every meal. Sometimes I help her. I love cooking for her when I can. We are a good team in situations when we have many guests at home. She changes recipes all the time, but my favourite dish would be her curry or her Istanbul Spices Chicken.
Most touching gesture
She surprised me when she turned up with croissants and pastries at the laboratory where I had to take blood tests. She was also the best nurse ever when I had the Dengue fever last year in Sri Lanka. She and her family are really great to me. I feel very close to them and they are very affectionate and caring. Shani always has the best ideas in getting presents for me. She is a wonderful listener and adviser for my life.
Birthdays
Shani doesnt like to celebrate her birthdays, but I try to take her out to a very good restaurant or spend nice weekends in the countryside. I make her a gift about culture: learning Germany or taking ballet dancing classes. She loves these kinds of gifts.
Alternative profession
If she could not become a professional pianist Shani would have been a poet. However she is talented in that arena too since she is releasing her first poetry book in 2018! She is talented in many things: giving lectures about culture, cooking, decorating or even creating websites!

NZ stun India by six wickets in 1st ODI
Mumbai: Century-maker Tom Latham and Ross Taylor inspired New Zealand to a thrilling six-wicket win over India in the first one-day international at Mumbais Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.
The batsmen put on a 200-run partnership as the Kiwis successfully chased down 281 to stun the hosts after Indian captain Virat Kohli had hit a century of his own.
Left-hander Latham smashed 103 off 102 balls, including eight fours and two sixes, while Taylor made 95 off 99 as New Zealand won with six balls to spare, finishing on 284-4.
The visitors run chase got off to a poor start with opener Colin Munro falling for 28 before Kiwis captain Kane Williamson walked shortly afterwards on a paltry six. When Martin Guptill was sent packing by Hardik Pandya in the 18th over for 32 New Zealand were at 80-3 and looking like they were heading for a heavy defeat.
But Latham and Taylor had other ideas and put on a superb 200-run fourth-wicket partnership that lasted 187 balls. Taylor, who hit eight fours, was dismissed in the penultimate over with New Zealand needing just one run to win.
The right-hander was caught out before Henry Nicholls came in and smashed a four to secure the tourists victory. Earlier, Kohli scored his 31st ODI century in his 200th match as India made 280-8 after winning the toss and opting to bat first. The Indian captain smashed 121 off 125 balls including nine fours and two sixes. AFP

## Title: Options for food security

Options for food security
Agriculture plays a central and strategic role in Sri Lankas development. Indeed, it is the key to economic growth, increased incomes, improved living standards, poverty eradication, and enhanced food security. In fact, most of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have direct or indirect linkages to the agricultural sector in the country. The goal number two is to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture.
The world food day fell on October 16 under the theme: Change the future of migration. Invest in food security and rural development. Still, 27.1 percent of labour force in the country is engaged in the agricultural sector.
The ratio of expenditure on food and drink to total expenditure is called food ratio. According to the Household Income and Expenditure Survey of Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) 2012/13, the average food ratio is 38 percent and this means an average household in Sri Lanka spends 38 percent for food of the total monthly expenditure. When considering the food ratio by sectors in the estate sector it is the highest as 49.8 percent, in rural sector 39.2 present and in urban sector 32.1 percent. This implies that a household in estate sector spends nearly 50 percent of its expenditure for food. The climate has changed rapidly and the country faced more extreme weather frequently during last few years than ever before. In 2014, both Maha and Yala seasons were affected by severe droughts prevailed throughout the year. After that, 2015 was a very satisfactory cropping year and both seasons performed well and ever highest paddy production of 4.8 Million Mt was recorded and a bumper harvest reached the markets. Again at the beginning of the 2015/16 Maha season flood damages were recorded.
The 2016 Yala season also was not quite satisfactory due to the flood situation prevailed at the beginning of the season. Now in 2017, the drought has taken it all during both Maha and Yala seasons. The lowest paddy production of 2.5 Million Mt was recorded in 2017, during the recent past in the country. Most of the other food crops production also declined sharply.
The delaying and insufficient monsoon rains severely affected the paddy and other field crop cultivations in most of the major producing areas in the country in both seasons in 2017. As a result of the above situation domestic prices of essential food commodities especially rice increased rapidly in the markets.
The price behaviour of most of the food commodities volatiles and reflects an increasing trend. The price of local Nadu rice in last week of September (Week 40) increased by 33% and 43% compared to the same period of 2016 and 2015 respectively. The rate of food inflation calculated by the DCS (Year to Year) recorded in January 2017 was 4.5 and it reached 10.4 in September and this was mainly due to the price pressure from rice, coconut, vegetables and onions. To stabilize the increasing food prices, the government, intervenes in various ways like promoting imports, import tax reductions, introducing food price ceilings, releasing government stocks to the markets, distributing food items at subsidized prices through government trading institutes like Cooperative Wholesale Establishment.
Impacts on food security
The above situation affects on the four dimensions of food security: food availability, food accessibility, food utilization and food system stability. Effects are already being felt in food markets, and are likely to be particularly significant in specific rural locations where crops fail and yields decline and urban locations where supply chains are disrupted and market prices increase. Most of the vulnerable people in the society are low-income consumers and small-scale farmers.
The availability of reliable data, statistics and information related to the four dimensions of food security and the adequate capacity to analyse the available information and good communication skills to inform decision-makers are the major determinants of food and nutritional security situation of a country. The data and information related to the Food availability: Domestic production, import capacity, Food stocks and Food aid comes under the availability.
The domestic production data comprises, cultivated land extent of major crops in each cropping seasons by Divisional secretarys (DS) level, crop damages, average yield, total production, marketable surplus, major surplus and deficit areas. This needs an efficient data collection and a monitoring system at village level mainly due to the calculation of food surplus or deficit depend on those data.
Next, the data on domestic and commercial stocks by District or DS level and Government buffer stocks are important. Domestic stocks available at farmers, commercial stocks available at major manufacturers like rice millers and traders by district level need to be monitored frequently. Another is the availability of imported stocks and food aid given by various local and international agencies by province or district level.
Food access refers to the way in which different people obtain available food. Normally, food is accessed through a combination of home production, stocks, purchase, barter, borrowing, sharing, gifts from relatives, and provisions by welfare systems or food aid. Food access is ensured when communities and households and all individuals within them have adequate resources, such as money to obtain appropriate foods for a nutritious diet. Access mainly depends on income available to the household and price of food.
Market prices reflect the supply-demand situation of food commodities and therefore, accurate prices are the most important. Market margins, Value chain analysis of food commodities are other related types of information. The Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute (HARTI) is a famous body for collection and dissemination of food commodity prices in all major markets in the country. HARTI provides a detail description of weekly commodity price behaviour in the country and its disseminate daily vegetable prices in all dedicated economic centres through a Mobile service provider, Mobitel, on 6666 hotline as a public-private partnership.
Such price information is valuable for farmers for increasing their bargaining power with the traders and also finding better markets. In this process, a further need is monitoring the commodity prices by Divisional Secretariat level mainly to identify the food security situation in isolated rural areas like estate areas, especially during food shortage periods. Therefore, the collection, monitoring, analysing and presenting of food prices by grass root level are major important parts in food security.
Access to food
Stability of supply and access: It explains the variation of weather in main seasons, Commodity price fluctuations, economic and political factors cause stability of supply and access to food. Weather-related data are an important part and that valuable primary information is entirely collected by the Meteorological Department of Sri Lanka.
Commodity price data mainly collected by the Department of Census and Statistics, HARTI and Central Bank of Sri Lanka.
Food utilization mainly consists of Food Safety, Hygiene and manufacturing practices applied in primary agricultural production, harvesting and storage, food processing; transportation, and retail. Diet quality and diversity, meeting needs in terms of energy, macro- and micronutrients are the major concerns in food utilization. In this category, the post-harvest losses, practices of all actors from farmer to retail in food supply chains and factors contribute to quality deterioration are important. Food nutrition data are an integral part of food security and those data should be collected through research, demographic health and household surveys. This type of data and information is compiled by the Ministry of Health, Medical Research Institute, DCS and Universities.
When considering our country many actors hold information about the food and nutrition security situation. The integration of those actors and holistic approaches through this information should be the need to strengthening. Therefore, now is the most suitable time to establish a common framework to ensure coherence.

## Title: Over 1.1 b people lack identification

Over 1.1 b people lack identification
US: More than 1.1 billion people worldwide officially dont exist -- going about their daily lives without proof of identity.
The issue leaves a significant fraction of the global population deprived of health and education services.
Among these invisible people -- many of whom live primarily in Africa and Asia -- more than one third are children susceptible to violence whose births have not been registered, the World Banks Identification for Development (ID4D) program recently warned.
The problem is particularly acute in geographical areas whose residents face poverty, discrimination, epidemics or armed conflicts.
Vyjayanti Desai, who manages the ID4D program, said the issue arises from a number of factors, but cited the distance between people and government services in developing areas as major.
For populations near the Peruvian Amazon, for example, traveling to an administrative service can take some five days of transit by boat, according to Carolina Trivelli, Perus former development minister.
Many families are also simply not informed about the importance of birth registration -- and the consequences of non-registration, which can include the denial of basic rights and benefits, or an increased likelihood of marrying or entering into the labor force underage.
And even if parents are aware of the need to declare a birth, costs can be crippling, said Anne-Sophie Lois, representative at the United Nations in Geneva and director of the childrens aid organization Plan International.
As a result, millions of children in Africa and Asia first encounter the administration only once they reach school age.
But birth certificates are often needed to enroll in school or take national exams, Lois said.
The political climate also discourages many families from allowing themselves to be officially identified.
People fear to be identified from one ethnic group or from one nationality, said Trivelli. The government has sometimes -- sadly -- preferences for some groups rather than another. And in many countries, births of children born out of wedlock or as a result of rape are sometimes deliberately concealed for fear of discrimination.
In China, avoiding birth registration was also deliberate for years for fear of repercussions due to the one-child policy.
Beyond being barred from attending school, these children can fall prey to violence ranging from forced labor for boys to early marriage for girls, denounced by UNICEF in a 2013 report.
These children can also fall victim to human trafficking.
The legal invisibility of unregistered children makes it more likely that their disappearance and exploitation will go unnoticed by authorities, Lois said.
To combat this immense problem, organizations are patiently working on the ground to identify these invisible people. - AFP

Pinnacle Residencies beachfront condo 333 Pinnacle launched in Negombo
Pinnacle Residencies, in partnership with Floreat Homes, recently launched the luxury beachfront condo development, 333 Pinnacle, in Negombo.
Exclusive Property marketing and sales for this development is carried out by My Property, a premier real estate company in Sri Lanka with a global outlook. My Property is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dwellings Group, Australia.
Pinnacle Residencies Managing Director Eranga Welikala said, From a global standpoint, beachfront properties basically never lose value. As our population grows, more and more people are going to want to live near the ocean, boosting the price of new developments so it is better to get in early. In fact, think of it as an investment. You will be able to sell it later for much more than what you paid, probably making several million rupees in the process. And, meanwhile, you will be able to walk on the beach every morning, and enjoy beachfront living that is free of pollutants and high in oxygen, which is envied by many others. One of the main reasons that beachfront homes are in such high-demand across the world.
Beachfront apartments are also easy to rent out as a holiday homes, with people willing to pay a virtual fortune to stay near the beach. Also, with Negombo being very close to Bandaranaike International Airport (Sri Lankas main international airport), there is a huge potential to rent to transit travelers, which we can help with, so these apartments are truly multifaceted in terms of investment opportunities, he added.
Being developed by Pinnacle Residencies and built by Floreat Homes, 333 Pinnacle is well-located overseeing the charming western coast of our Island nation. Situated in a most prized neighborhood in Negombo, 333 Pinnacle is even more notable because provides unbeatable and picturesque views of the sun setting in the Indian Ocean.
This is as a direct result of the commitment by Pinnacle Residencies and Floreat Homes to work together to create a true beachfront apartment oasis, where one not only easily accesses the ocean but also benefits from panoramic sunset views and serene, environmentally conscious living, all just a few kilometers from the upcoming Colombo megapolis.

Port City Project sustainability beyond philanthropy
Managing Director of Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd, Jiang Houliang, speaking at the 11th Annual General Meeting of the Institute of Environmental Professionals Sri Lanka, said that the Port City Colombos vision was to be the benchmark in environmental friendliness and sustainability.
He said that the new city which will be a show piece for the rest of the world, would be a place where environmentally friendly people, organizations and visitors will want to live and do business and the transit population will be allowed to practice their environmentally friendly habits.Port City Colombo even plans to incorporate sustainability guidelines for third party developers to abide by, when they develop their individual plots of land; which is keeping with their commitment to build a completely sustainable city, extending beyond their scope as master developer.
The Port City project has a huge international executive force working on every aspect of its sustainable development. We are adhering to the best development practices. For us, corporate social responsibility and environmental sustainability are not just means to establish a relationship with our communities so that we can channel our philanthropy and do image management. This project will go far beyond that. We genuinely believe that adhering to global best practices in sustainability is linked with economic and commercial success and this will be demanded by those who invest and live in the Port City in the future. That is why we are continuing to forge real stakeholder involvement and innovative partnerships as we cannot succeed alone. Therefore, we are mindful that future generations will measure the success of this project by its environmental and social sustainability. That is why we are making investments in these areas today.
Speaking of Port Citys view on Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Jiang said Being a good corporate citizen is an important factor for any organization; however CSR priorities are not the same in different parts of the world. For example, in a country like Sri Lanka philanthropy and community engagement play an important role. If you are in the driving seat of a project such as the Port City, you have to be in sync with this. At the same time one has to also be sensitive to local norms and deep rooted cultural traditions; when it comes to philanthropy projects and community engagement. Therefore, our initial foray into CSR was looking at the well-being of adjacent communities, such as the Fishermens Livelihood Support Society(FLSS) project we have been sponsoring in Negombo.
We have allocated 500 million rupees towards the sustainability and well-being of a community living to the North of Colombo. The FLSS which operates under the Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Development Ministry and the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development is an initiative supported and fully funded by the Port City and its primary objective is to find meaningful ways to support fishing communities in these areas, All the programs carried out are suggested by the community and evaluated independently by officials of the two ministries.
The Managing Director of Colombo Port City, addressing some of the initial doubts expressed by various parties about the project; particularly the ongoing dredging operation, said that sand dredging for the project is being carried out after a detailed environmental impact assessment, which had its public comments in December 2015. It is carried out in a completely sustainable manner at distances of over 7 km from the shoreline, and at depths of 15 m or more. The dredging has no impact on coastal erosion or fisher livelihoods. Representatives of fishermen have come on board the dredger to personally observe the advanced technology we use. The dredgers used are the best in the world and their GPS tracking records are available for public scrutiny via internet, he said.
The Port City Colombo was the main sponsor of the 11th AGM of the Environmental Professionals Sri Lanka, held under the theme Rescuing Wetlands for Future Economic Development.

Private sector investments vital to stabilise economy: PM
Increasing private sector investments is very important to strengthen the government programme aimed to stabilise the economy by systematic debt management. Wider opportunities will be offered for private investors in this regard, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the gathering at the 45th anniversary celebrations of the Mahanuwara Sinhala Velanda Peramuna at the Grand Kandyan Hotel on October 20.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the country needed Rs. 3,000 billion to repay debt during the next two years. It would not be a problem when the economy picked up under the governments development plans, the Premier said.
The Mahanuwwara Sinhala Velanda Sangamaya had produced a powerful trader community connected with the open economy. Its membership had rendered a great socio-economic service by providing direct and indirect employments to nearly 17,500 people, the Prime Minister said.
It was to steer the country towards development that they have formed a national government. This was a fine opportunity to take the country forward by developing the economy, he said.
Widening the VAT net was a step taken by the Government to increase state income. While managing the countrys debt, the Government had to find money for education and health services. The only way is through private investments. Countries like China and Singapore had achieved vast strides in development by increasing private investments, the Prime Minister said.
Referring to a statement made by the Associations President, the Prime Minister said he too liked to reduce the direct and indirect taxes. But it could not be done soon due to the countrys immense debt burden, he said.
Since taxes could not be decreased at once, they had decided an alternative to provide almost 200 percent of capital needed for new investments. This could be increased to 300 percent if they invested in the north, he said.
The country regained the GSP plus facility. We could send 6,000 types of goods to Europe under the facility. But now we sent under it only about 60 items, the Premier said.
Today the business world had shifted to online. Our businesspersons too should get accustomed to modern business lines. The Government would enter into free trade agreements with China, India and several other countries with an eye on the next 10 to 15 years, he said.
The Central Expressway was planned to usher in development to the Kandyan areas. Japan had agreed to assist to develop the Kandy City, he said.
Mahanuwara Sinhala Velanda Peramuna President Newton Pieris said their membership had provided nearly 25,000 direct and nearly 150,000 indirect employment avenues to people.
The business community had achieved many victories via open economic policies introduced in 1977. Their entire business turnover amounted to nearly Rs. 200 billion and they paid nearly Rs. 5 billion annually as direct and indirect taxes, he said.
Association Secretary Vajira Keerthikumara delivered the vote of thanks.
Ministers Lakshman Kiriella and Malik Samarawickrema, Central Province Governor Niluka Ekanayake and Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake were present.

Robredo warns of China debt trap, cites Sri Lanka
The Duterte administrations new source of financing for its ambitious infrastructure projects, China, could lead the Philippines into a debt trap as it did other countries that had borrowed heavily from the Asian giant, according to Vice President Leni Robredo.
Robredo cited the project to build a new Bicol Express, a rail system connecting Manila and Bicol region, for P175 billion, which would come from a Chinese loan.
Robredo said there should be a better way to finance the project other than through loans from China.
First of all, its debt. Very huge, P171 billion. Thats very huge, said Robredo, who is a native of Naga. Our fear is we might get stuck in a debt trap like the one experienced by Sri Lanka, she said.
According to BBC.com, Sri Lanka had relied so heavily on loans, mostly from China, that 95 percent of all government revenues now go to debt repayment alone.
Many of the projects funded by Chinese loans turned out to be nonprofitable, according to the BBC.com report.
Of course, if its debt, we will be the ones to bear the burden. It should be decided on properly, Robredo said.
But Robredo said it seemed like economic managers, who had presented financing models for the rail projects, were no longer looking at any alternative.
She said she had asked Cesar Chavez, a former dzRH reporter and transportation undersecretary, and Mercedita Sombillo, assistant economic planning secretary, to look at alternatives and give us whats the most favorable for all.
Robredo said that while she was not opposed to Chinas role in the Build, Build, Build infrastructure plan of President Duterte, concerns had been raised about the profitability of some of the projects.
She said the proposal of three private companies that had expressed interest on the Bicol rail project as a private-public partnership (PPP) was also worth looking at. She did not identify the companies, though.
Why not look at that Robredo said. She said that if the government waited to settle concerns about profiting by the private firms, the process might take longer.
Dutertes predecessor, Benigno Aquino III, had tried to promote the PPP model as a means to build key infrastructure without spending government money.

Ryan Jayalath released under strict bail condition

Medical Faculty Students' Action Committee Convener Ryan Jayalath arrested on charges of causing damages to public property by forcibly entering the premises of the Ministry of Health during an anti-SAITM protest was today ordered to be released under strict bail conditions by the Colombo High Court.
The Colombo High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyantuduwa made this order taking into consideration a revision application filed on behalf of the suspect challenging the Maligakanda Magistrates Court decision not to grant bail.
Accordingly, the suspect was ordered to be released on a personal bail of Rs. 500,000 and his parents were accepted as the signatories to the bond. Ryan Jayalath was released on bail taking into consideration his future educational activities as an exceptional circumstance.
While ordering the suspect to be released on bail, the High Court Judge warned that bail could be canceled and accused would be remanded until the conclusion of the trial, if he violated the bail conditions or repeated the commission of any other offence.
Meanwhile, the High Court Judge issued an order directing the Director of Colombo Crimes Division that the activities of the suspect be monitored in order to ascertain whether he would comply with the court order.
"No one has power to take laws into their hands. All should respect to the countrys law and no one can ignore the law. The bail can be canceled, even with a photograph to prove that he violates court order. This Court will monitor the suspects future activities, the High Court Judge said.
Meanwhile, Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Court that the suspect currently has seven pending court cases in the Magistrates Court. He said this revision application cannot be maintained due to several shortcomings because it has failed to demonstrate the facts challenging the Magistrates order.
Defence Counsel Gamini Alwis appearing on behalf of suspect moved Court that his client be released on bail since he was in remand custody over a period of two months.
My client had entered to the Ruhuna university in the year of 2010 to follow a MBBS science degree. Now he is expecting to participate in internship training, Defence Counsel added.
The suspects were charged under the Public Property Act.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General. Counsel Gamini Alwis appeared for the suspect-petitioner.

Save your heart with yoga and aerobics
Just one yoga class and one jogging session a week could cut your risk in half of developing heart disease, a study claims.
Researchers studied how the combination of yoga and aerobic exercise can impact someones blood pressure, body mass index and cholesterol levels. About 610,000 people die of heart disease every year in the United States, which is almost one in every four people.
The findings suggest that combining yoga and aerobics doubles the positive health effects and could be imperative for those who want to lessen their risk of developing heart disease.
Researchers from HG SMS Hospital in Jaipur, India, presented the study at the eighth Emirates Cardiac Society Congress in collaboration with the American College of Cardiology Middle East Conference. The study looked at 750 patients who had previously been diagnosed with coronary heart disease.
One group of 225 patients participated in aerobic exercise, another group of 240 patients participated in yoga, and a third group of 285 participated in both yoga and aerobic exercise. Each group did three, six-month sessions of their assigned exercises.
The exercise focuses on connecting the mind to the body through poses and deep breathing, which has found to alleviate heart pressure and stress.
Researchers wanted to see if yoga and aerobic exercise would have an effect on coronary risk factors of obese patients with type 2 diabetes. The findings showed that aerobic exercise only and yoga only groups showed similar reductions in blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, weight and waist circumference.
However, the combined yoga and aerobic exercise group showed a two times greater reduction compared to the other groups. They also showed significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction, diastolic function and exercise capacity.
Combined Indian yoga and aerobic exercise reduce mental, physical and vascular stress and can lead to decreased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, said co-authors Dr Sonal Tanwar, a scholar in preventative cardiology, and Dr Naresh Sen, a consultant cardiologist, both with HG SMS Hospital. Heart disease patients could benefit from learning Indian yoga and making it a routine part of daily life, they added.

Suicide in Sri Lanka
Its a widely-held belief that Sri Lanka has one of the highest rates of suicide in the world: the World Health Organization (WHO) actually ranks Sri Lankas suicide rate as the highest.
But researchers who study suicide say theres a big catch: the data is wrong.
Its disregarding that theres actually been a drop in Sri Lankas suicide rates and thats a problem, said Dr. Dee Knipe, a professor at the University of Bristol, speaking in Colombo last week.
To standardize and compare data from around the world, the WHO uses mortality data and puts it into a model. But Sri Lanka last submitted data to the WHO in 2006. The organizations current numbers are projections based on that past submission.
More local data tells a different story. Numbers compiled annually by the Sri Lanka Polices Division of Statistics show that the suicide rate has actually fallen by 70 percent since the mid-1990s.
That would put Sri Lankas suicide rate closer to the 22nd highest in the world, rather than the first.
Instead of a global tragedy, Dr. Knipe believes Sri Lanka should be held up as an example of suicide prevention.
I dont understand, we should be shouting about this, she said. The story of how those rates felland what she estimates amounts to 93,000 lives savedis one of diligent public policy. But theres much more work to be done.
Pesticide bans
Dr. Dee Knipe
Sri Lankas suicide deaths stood at an all-time high in 1995, according to police records, with a rate of 57 per 100,000 people.
They started rising in the 1960s and 1970s and academics and health advocates at the time pointed to the introduction of highly hazardous pesticides as the culprit.
Thats because attempting suicide by pesticide poisoning, which was very available in largely agricultural Sri Lanka, was more likely to result in fatality.
What we know is that people who experience a certain level of distress might engage of impulsive acts of self-harm with low suicidal intent, Knipe said, They would use the thing thats most readily availableand often thats self-poisoning.
The Registrar of Pesticides initially banned the toxic chemicals parathion and methyl parathion in 1984. The move quickly slowed the exponential growth of suicide deaths, police records show.
That initial ban was followed by bans of five more highly toxic pesticides in 1995 and another in 1998. Three more pesticides, dimethoate, fenthion, and paraquat, were banned between 2008 and 2011.
Sri Lankas pesticide regulations appear to have contributed to one of the greatest decreases in suicide rate ever seen, Knipe said. We are a leading example of how a public policy can really have an impact on saving lives
Knipe warns, though, that the work is far from over.
We havent really dealt with the causes (of suicide), the distress and underlying issues, she said, But basically, more people are at least surviving their attempts.
Seeking help
People going through psychological distress often feel completely alone. But mental health advocates urge people to pick up the phone and ask for help. One of the most visible help-lines in Sri Lanka is Sumithrayo. The organization was founded over 40 years ago and offers free over the phone, face-to-face, and online counselling.
A Sumithrayo spokesperson said that their office usually receives 20 to 25 requests for help a day. Help line volunteers remain anonymous, which they say lowers the mental barrier to calling for help, and protects client confidentiality.
Our main objective is suicide prevention, but we also look at alleviating any other kind of pain theyre going through, the spokeswoman said. Its a process of unburdening, helping them to cope with those feelingsafter theyre comfortable we talk about what they can do to help themselves and empower them to cope with their situations.
Talking helps, she said, To reach out, and to talk about it before they act on their feelings.
But rather than only helping individuals struggling with suicidal thoughts, psychologists say they are also fighting another battle: against the culture at large.
People think that talking about suicide is attention-seeking, but suicide is most often a cry for help, said Nivendra Uduman, a private practice counseling psychologist who has also worked with Kings College London Resource Centre for Trauma, Displacement and Mental Health in Colombo.
Uduman said the stigma around suicide in Sri Lanka keeps many from talking about the pain theyre going through, as they feel shame or fear they wont be taken seriously.
Suicide can be very impulsive, it can be used as a way of communicating something to another person that they find difficult to communicate, he said.
Apart from his work as a therapist, Uduman also leads trainings for the general public to identify risk factors and warning signs of suicide.
Mental illnesses
Some people turn to suicide because they are struggling with mental illness, he said. Symptoms of depression and warning signs of suicide can include changes in sleep or appetite, lack of interest in daily activities, fluctuations in mood, substance abuse, talking about killing themselves and giving away possessions, Uduman said.
But attempting suicide is not always a sign of mental illness, thats a misconception, he said. Most people in their lifetime may have thought about suicidethat doesnt mean they have a mental illness.
Big life changeslike an ended relationship, or debtcan lead people to impulsive, suicidal behaviour. Uduman hopes people can start speaking about suicide more openly, without judgment, with their friends and family.
Research has shown that talking about suicide will give people the environment and permission to start talking about how they feel, he said.
Uduman warned that Sri Lanka needs to bolster its mental health system to meet the need. Services are mostly available in Colombo, and outside Colombo its much harder to find help, he said.
Most general hospitals around the island have mental health units, but proper staffing remains a problem. Sri Lanka only has between 30 and 40 registered psychologists, according to Dr. Shamala Kumar, the current head of the Sri Lanka Psychology Association.
There needs to be more psychological support to help people struggling with suicidal thoughts, Uduman said. Until then, people should actively pursue the available treatment.
Because making that call, asking a person how they are feeling, and connecting them to professional help can mean the difference between life and death.
Most people dont want to die, he said, They just dont want to live the life they have.

## Title: A TALE OF TWO ROADS

A TALE OF TWO ROADS
There are two roads in Colombo, nay, there are hundreds, but for the purpose of this article I will just concentrate on the two. In different ways the story of these two roads tells us of our agony, a nations failure, why much talked of development is an illusory dream, only a tempting topic for seminars, never to be realized on the ground fully.
Both roads taken as examples here are from the heart of Colombo, zones 5 and 7, where we are told the educated, capable and the empowered of the country live. If the situation is such right in front of them, we can only surmise how bad it must be in the rest of the country.
Park Road, Colombo 5, running from Havelock Town to Polhengoda, is a principal road connecting the High Level and Baseline Roads, two main arteries of the city road network. Although a busy road now, until about ten years ago this was an attractive residential area and the road is still relatively narrow with many large shady trees on either side. In the days gone by Park Road was considered upper middle class and up-market, claiming several eminent residents. Mervyn Silva of political fame is said to be a recent resident. Among other important institutions along the road is the Lanka Hospitals (former Apollo Hospital). Down the road there are several schools too. On a daily basis, thousands use this road; office and other workers, students, residents and those seeking treatment at the hospital predominating.
Approximately a year back, it could be more; some development work began on the road near the hospital. This included digging deep drains and culverts requiring one side of the road to be closed for vehicles. The narrow road became even narrower and allows for only one way traffic at a time. The hardships that the road users suffer as a result, especially at peak hours, cannot be imagined. Traffic is halted for one line to clear, and in this slow process the halted line of vehicles on the opposite side builds up to about half a mile. In the peak hours to clear the section of the road under repair takes well over half an hour (a distance of about 20 yards).
When it rains the water collects in the pot-holes on the road and the entire area turns into a muddy field. In the narrow section of the road open for movement cars, buses, three wheelers and motor cycles scramble to clear the area, splashing slush all over. The vehicles coming from the opposite direction wait with obvious impatience only for an opportunity to seize the advantage in the struggle to inch forward. There is no attempt by the authorities whatsoever to guide or control the chaotic traffic here.
In the early days of the road work the halted commuters took the inconvenience in their stride, after all the roads have to be improved and we must be patient. A month went by, another, and now more than a year has passed. Now there is no forgiving, it is more than enough time to have built a major high way. In this time period, China would have erected an entire city!
Going by what has been observed, there is no schedule for this road work and definitely no finish date. From issue to issue, from one work gang to another, from one pit to another they go with no idea when the commuters' suffering would end.
Flower Road
The second road I wish to comment on is Flower Road, Colombo 7 where we are told many new rich (generally, the source of money unknown!) have now found abode, mainly down the side lanes. Wide and relatively less busy, it is not as residential as Park Road, with many offices, schools, banks and other business establishments based there.
One end of Flower Road, which is very commercial, merges with Green Path. This section has developed into a fine shopping area with several attractive restaurants and shops. Those who are attempting to develop the tourist industry in this country often bemoan the paucity of such facilities in Colombo. For all our big talk about tourism, we still can only flog our crowded (and polluted) beaches and the heritage cities, a good days drive away on bad and overcrowded roads. If we want tourism money, there must be life style options available, places to eat, play, shop and chill, especially in the urban centres. It is no point directing the tourists to the over emphasized sophisticated shopping malls to the point of pathos; such facilities must be the general standard in a city with ambitions of becoming a South Asian hub.
Not only the tourists, the citizens too are entitled to decent restaurants, eateries and shops. These are not luxuries today, they are standard features of any city worth its name.
A few days back, at about 8 p.m., I dropped by at a cake shop located in this area. Parking was hard to find as one side of the road was completely closed for parking, while several segments of the other side too carried the yellow line. I inquired from a security guard standing nearby why at that late hour the area had such restricted parking. His explanation was that a VVIPs office was located nearby.
If it is a concern that a bomb may be placed in a car parked on a side, then there is no logic in allowing parking on the other side of the road. I doubt very much that the pertivular VVIP is aware of the whimsical security arrangements that are made in his name on public roads. In the era when Gotabhaya Rajapaksa was the czar of security and everything to do with roads and movement, roads were closed and traffic diverted depending solely on the Rajapaksa family activities. While the loudest boast of the then government was that terrorism was completely eradicated, massive operations were kept going indefinitely to thwart the non-existent terrorists!
For all the good he did (it is not too difficult to show results when such power and a huge budget is bestowed on a person. But to be fair by him, we have had several in the past who have had the power and the budgets, but did nothing!), we cannot but notice the limitations of the Gotabhaya vision and outlook. Is the purpose of a given society to glorify its (elected!) leaders, fall prostrate before them and raise them so high in the public image that they appear near deities; and do all this with public money and common assets On the roads, they are at the top of the food chain, the prime users; for their uninterrupted movement all other traffic stopped, roads cleared, parking denied for everybody else.
Security detail of politicos
A brothers interest in building up the public persona of his sibling with the mystique of frenetic security can be understood in this case, especially, as the careers of the Rajapaksa brothers were interdependent.
They also display a surer insight into the national psyche. But is such an attitude, backed with the unthinking military culture of obedience, necessarily in the long term democratic interest of a people With the passing of time, it has become apparent that not all their activities were in the national interest nor motivated by high ideals.
Apart from being self-serving (like Constitutional amendments to extend presidential terms); many of their actions seem venal if not downright criminal. Even under this dispensation, is there a Gotabhaya clone making arbitrary decisions on road closures and no parking zones purely to flatter his boss If we are to go by the accusations made in the parliament about each other, from wall to wall it is filled with spivs, rogues and rascals. The Oxford Dictionary defines a spiv thus- A person not in regular employment but who makes money by dubious business methods, and who goes about smartly dressed and having a good time. That such persons command so much security, against a non-existent threat at that, insults our intelligence.
For the feudal mindset, it seems there is reflected glory in venerating the boss. Even for the right to venerate, or closer access to the political deity, there is intense competition. In this country, the average Constable is more a security guard for the political bosses and less a protector of person and property of the citizen. The security detail of politicos behaves rather like streets toughs providing cover for a mafia boss than legitimate security provided by a recognized State. In their excitement they think nothing of shoving people off, breaking traffic rules and ignoring the law of the land.
Recently, an MP found fault with one of her State provided security guards for the faulty fixing of a gas cylinder in her kitchen, an errant errand boy! There is a whole system of government; offices, vehicles and personnel whose job is to only serve them. When at it, they run about in a crazed manner, waving their hands, flashing lights, stopping other traffic for the show of guarding these politicians. I have also observed that chiefs of the forces, whose job is to guard us, also have similar protection.
It is only a show; because remember, there are no bad guys since 2009. Adults made to pretend and pantomime like children by the system. They have no other skills to fall back on. To abolish this unthinking nonsense would be to abolish the whole system, that is how far the rot has spread. The system knows no other function.
Coming back to the basic situation, although businesses pay premium rates and taxes, they get very little from the State, not even parking for their customers, not even at 8 p.m. They operate under a high interest (bank) regime and often are victims of corrupt and inconsistent regulators and contradictory and unclear regulations.
On the other hand, with projects like what is happening down Park Road, public money is applied in the most amateurish of ways, a road development with no end in sight. The countrys economy is growing at a below par rate, tourism is down and the spirit of discontent spreads. If it is so in these plush enclaves, we dread to think how it must be for most of our citizens; an anxious life, full of only hardships and burdens.

TEA cries foul over govts  tea industry strategy
The Tea Exports Association (TEA) lashed out at the government said that the government has politicized the tea industry and soon the industry would no longer be a major foreign exchange earner.
TEA officials at a special press conference at Cinnamon Grand prior to their Annual General Meeting under the theme Tea Tweak 2020 at Cinnamon Grand, said on Friday that the reason for the apparel sector to progress to great heights was that it does not have any government intervention nor does it have any state enterprises involved in exports.
This is why you see greater value addition and in apparel sector and today even fabrics that were imported are being manufactures in Sri Lanka.
TEA officials said that the tea industrys first hiccup in their 150 year journey was the takeover of some private sector estates and then the creation of state plantation companies and the subsequent influence from the government to the industry.
Chairman of TEA Jayantha Karunaratne was extremely critical in the manner in which the CESS was collected from tea exporters as a tax and then it not being utilized.
The Chairman said that there was Rs. 7 billion accumulated in the fund and only around Rs. 2 billion was used. But we are not happy in the manner in which it was used and we dont think it was used for promotions. However we must also admit that in recent times it was not used for political promotions.
The industry wants to be a part of the decision making on the usage of this CESS fund and we want some members from private sector be included to manage the CESS fund.
We also urge the government to abolish further collection of the promotional and marketing levy.
He said that they were surprised that part of this CESS fund was used for Tea Research Institute (TRI) funding and the government should fund that separately. Government did fund TRI before the estates were taken over in the 1970s.
They also said that the TRI is not doing enough and it should be either privatized or run as Private Public Partnership model.
The TEA also came very hard on the non liberalization of tea imports by the government and asked as to why the government is not ready to this which would allow value addition from Sri Lanka and re-export.
The governments on two successive budgets promised to do this however they still dont have the nerve to do it. Delay in implementing the liberalization has deterred the progress of the once thriving industry.
TEA officials explained that only 292 million kilos are produced locally and this amount is not sufficient and assured that the import of tea would not have a negative impact for the local industry.
Rohan Fernando, Immediate Past President TEA said that Lipton, the worlds largest tea producer, was first in Sri Lanka but was forced to set up plants all over the world since they did not have sufficient tea locally for value addition. Even today there are over 20 local companies who operate overseas due to this issue and the number is increasing.
Value addition can make Sri Lanka a globe tea hub as it is a US $ 5 billion industry. I dont see why government cant read this, he cautioned.

TEA lambasts  Minister Samarasinghe over CESS
Tea Exports Association (TEA) criticized former Minister of Plantations, Mahinda Samarasinghe accusing him of taking the industry on a ride by introducing the CESS.
The idea was to create a fund via a percentage of tea export revenue and this fund was to be managed jointly by both the government and private sector stake holders. We as the industry stake holders then lobbied and managed to get the consent of the exporters and annually around Rs. 2 billion was collected, said TEA Vice President, Roahn Fernando.
However the Minister for reasons best known to him then had decided to leave aside the private sector and the fund was managed by a 100% government. When the gazette was published in this regard we thought that the Minister took the whole tea industry for a ride as private sector was kicked out, he claimed. (SS)

Thanapathiwarayakuge Dinapothin
Senior Diplomat Ranjith Gunaratna recently came out with his book Thanapathiwarayakuge Dinapothin (Ambassadors Diary), which compiles several stories based on his experiences as a long-serving diplomat. The book written in Sinhala compiles stories about people from all walks of life; whom Gunaratna had acquainted during his 25 years of service as a diplomat. Gunaratna has held key positions in a number of Sri Lankan foreign missions during his career. He currently serves as the Consul General at the Sri Lankan Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany.
Excerpts follow:
Q: This is a rare publication, in the sense that not many Sri Lankan diplomats have penned their experiences while working at foreign missions. Was there any specific purpose or aim behind your effort
A: In general, diplomats write various reports, analyses and memos during their career. Yet, their personal experiences abroad do not reflect in these official documents. In comparison to the diplomats of other countries, Sri Lankan diplomats rarely discuss about their experiences. My new book, 'Ambassadors Diary,' is aimed at filling this vacuum. It is based on my experiences in the 25 years of career as a diplomat. The stories are about people from all walks of life; whom I have had acquaintances. The stories reflect my journey across the western societies dominated by liberal thinking, Asian societies that espouse Asian values and Middle East societies that are based on Islamic way of thinking. Amidst this cultural confusion, I found ingredients for the stories.
Q: You may have met many foreign leaders during your long career as a diplomat. Who are the ones who impressed you most
A: Countless men and women influenced my career. Among them, I highly admire Lee Kwan Yew, whose vision, dedication and commitments paved the way for the emergence of the modern Singapore. One can have certain criticisms about his style of governing. Yet, if you compare Singapore in 1950s to present, you would certainly feel admiring Lee. Other than him, I always have a high regard for Japanese leaders. We can learn a lot from Japan. Unfortunately, most of our politicians are groping in the dark as they lack a clear vision. This is one reason for me to write this book as it would help them to understand the world beyond their political domain.
Q: You seem to be highly impressed by Lee Kuan Yew, the first Prime Minister of Singapore. What prompted you to translate into Sinhala the book on Yew and Singapores rise under his rule
A: I was able to impress him on my idea of translating the book when I met him at a conference. The book depicts Lee's strategies and approaches to each challenge he faced in the nation building process. Although there are different views about some strategies adopted by Lee Kwan Yew, we can still agree with many of his actions. Politically, Lee tried to foster a Southeast Asian identity instead of a Chinese identity in Singapore. Lee Kwan Yew's 'The Singapore Story' helps us to understand Singapore's political culture in general and many government policies in particular. Overall, as a multi-ethnic country, Sri Lanka could learn a lot on nation building in Singapore. This is one of the main reasons for me to translate this remarkable book.
Q: In Your book you highlight the challenges faced by Sri Lankan migrant workers. What steps you recommend to ensure enhanced security, welfare and living standards for them while working abroad.
A: According to my experience, they encounter social issues and work place related issues. However, they have no control over the work place related issues such as sexual, physical and verbal abuses, denial of basic facilities, non-payment or under payment of salaries, long working hours, inability to return to Sri Lanka on completion of contract, restrictions on freedom of movement and communication with the relatives, denial of compensation for work place related accident and physical aggression. In addition, they are also victims of human smuggling, forced labour, forced prostitution, racial discrimination, inequality, arbitrary treatments by the authorities and crimes. In this context, Sri Lanka needs to work with the respective labour receiving countries to address these issues collectively.
Q: Do you think the government should ban sending Sri Lankan women to work as domestic workers abroad
A: India has imposed a ban. However, banning of Sri Lankan women seeking employment as domestic workers is not a solution to the problems. They leave due to lack of opportunities in Sri Lanka. We can talk about a ban when they have other alternatives in Sri Lanka. For that Sri Lankan system is not yet ready. Sri Lanka seeks to address these issues within the existing system and with the cooperation of the labour-receiving countries while gradually opening new vistas of opportunities for them in the country.
Q: In your book you highlight several instances of unethical and unnecessary interference or influence by politicians or those affiliated to them in the work at foreign missions
A: In Sri Lanka, today, political interference is a cultural phenomenon. Political interference occurs in two situations. The first situation prevails when the system does not function properly and people are suffering as a result. For this, bureaucrats are responsible. The second scenario occurs when politicians attempt to manipulate the system for their gains. However, undue political interference always creates unpleasant environment. Such interferences affect smooth functioning of Sri Lankan missions too. We are always looking forward to working without any undue political interference. Yet, Sri Lankan is not yet ready to move forward without political maneuvering.
Q: what are your views on non-career diplomats being appointed for high posts at Sri Lankan foreign missions
A: Most countries appoint non-career diplomats. This is the policy of the Sri Lankan governments too. We have seen great Sri Lankan non-career envoys in the past. Some of them have performed better than career diplomats. However, I personally think there is no problem appointing a few suitable political appointees. The question is about their suitability.
Q: Can you describe your experiences related to the activities of the Pro-LTTE lobby in foreign countries
A: LTTE has always been lobbying in the foreign countries against Sri Lanka. Our missions have been able to respond to their propaganda very effectively occasionally with some drawbacks.
I have always worked with the Sri Lankan diaspora to respond to the LTTE. Support of the Sri Lankan diaspora was vital in this exercise. I believe that Sri Lankan diplomats need to work very closely with the Sri Lankan diaspora to garner their support to protect and promote Sri Lankan interests abroad.
Q: The positives and negatives you see in Sri Lankas Foreign Service and suggestions for improvement
A: Diplomacy is a highly sophisticated subject. If we are not updated with the current knowledge on this subject, we cannot perform effectively.
Most of our diplomats do not pay much attention to professionality.
We need to be equipped ourselves with necessary tools, knowledge and skilled required to perform in the digitally tuned world. Question is, do we have these in our hands
Q: Are you planning for any new publications in the future
A: At present, I am working on an English short story book to be published internationally. I am also conducting a research on Sri Lankan diaspora.
This study mainly explores the nexus between Sri Lankan diaspora and economic development in Sri Lanka and the diasporas relations with the state, political entities, and a border spectrum of the Sri Lankan society through economic, political, social, cultural and virtual activities.
It is also aimed at understanding its impact on Sri Lanka as an agent of change and the future of State-diaspora relations in the context of globalization. My plan is to produce an ably researched publication on Sri Lankan diaspora in English and Sinhala languages.

Three and breezy as Thomas wins drama-filled CJ Cup
Justin Thomas holed a two-foot birdie putt at the second sudden-death playoff hole Sunday to beat Marc Leishman and win a US PGA Tour title in Asia for the third time.
The pair had finished 72 holes at the CJ Cup in South Korea locked at nine-under par, after both missedeagle putts on the 18th hole of a windswept final round of wildly fluctuating fortunes. Both parred the 18th on their first playoff visit, though Leishman was fortunate to get away with an errant drive and benefit from two free drops: first from behind a wall and then from a service road.
But the burly Australians luck ran out second time round as his three wood approach carved off on the swirling winds into the water surrounding the island green.
American Thomas then ripped his three wood unerringly to the front fringe of the putting surface and ran a putt to two feet from the flag.
It proved enough as Leishman took a bogey six and Thomas tapped in for the birdie to seal the $1.665 million winners cheque. AFP

A true smile makes the world go round in Style
You have to really empathize with people holding demanding service industry jobs. Thousands of you are hard working skilled employees or professionals who are occupied in stressful and exactingoccupations. But all you folks have it easy compared with the poor souls who, despite being paid miserable wages and measly benefits, are required to smile all day.
Although I have done my share of public relations stints I have never been pressed to keep smiling until my gritted teeth hurt. If I would have had to suffer such pressures I certainly would have provided any such demanders with an un-clinical example of free dentistry.That is why I really pity all those people engaged in the service industry whose job compels them to flash a smile at every potential customer.
Adaptable and appropriate
For those in hospitality, airline, retail and most any service industry, I would not like to be in your shoes, and walk the talk in such testing vocations. In effect, let me assure all you servers out there that I feel your pain.
A smile can communicate a surfeit of various meanings. But that again would depend on the type of smile and how it is taken to mean. People normally figure out the intimation of a smile since it was a considerable design for survival. Throughout the ages it revealed to the recipient if the smile was one of sarcasm or genuine friendship.
Some read a smile as an intimation of delight, others as a grin of annoyance or irritability. History has proved that certain such interpretations of smiles, whether rightly or wrongly construed, have diplomatically averted potential skirmishes or encouraged the start of armed conflicts. As the woman of the century Mother Teresa so succinctly put it: Peace begins with a smile.
It is true that people smile for varied reasons. There is a specific something within the customary expressive smile which makes it adaptable and appropriate in various circumstances. Everyone knows that a power of an endearing smile could ease tensions in the most explosive situations and get you out of even the most troubled encounters.
We all use a variance of smiles in our everyday dealings. Perceptibly, it is the rudimentary type of smile which is known as a happy smile. Such a smile is genuinely straightforward and engaging and easy to recognise by most. It clearly expresses that the smiler is delighted or appreciative over a pleasurable encounter. It is usually a demonstration or acceptance of kindness, love, happiness or simply being appreciative of the presence of the company.
A diminutive gleam
Then there is also the shamefaced or embarrassed smile. This routinely occurs when we make a blunder or drop a clanger that would prove discomfiting to the people you are having a discussion with. The sheepish smile is meant to take the edge off your bungle or omission and attempts to stir a more benign response by the affronted party.
There is again the attentive smile. This is a diminutive gleam on the face of listeners which give the impression that they are all ears to the conversation. In stark contrast is the devious or deceitful grin which is known as the fake or forged smirk.
This specific sneer could be baiting or unctuous and extremely questionable because it could create a great deal of misunderstanding.
The social smile is intended to exhibit respect, dependability, honesty and openness. People usually flash this smile when they come across people for the first time at a social event. As most great marketers would tell you, retail is part selling and part psychology and in this case it is true for both shoppers and employees. People are sometimes offended by the type of a smile that one makes even though one is not willing to smile. Meaning it is not a spontaneous smile and can be construed as forced, unnatural or mechanical.
No, I am not an anti-smiling lobbyist. I know smiling helps your immune system. Yes it does release endorphins, the bodys natural painkillers. Still, I have learnt from experience that if a man smiles all the time, he is probably selling something that does not work. As someone, probably a conman so aptly said: A smile is an effective way to get out of trouble, even if it happens to be a fake one. Now, dont get me wrong. I am not saying you should not smile if you feel like smiling. No one wants to be around a moosala personality who constantly wears a hangdog expression. Neither am I suggesting walking around grinning at people all day. That would be more likely to make someone suspicious that you are a grinning idiot rather than helping lift their spirits.
Positively affecting
But psychologists recommend a smile, even if it is a sad smile, because sadder than a sad smile is the sadness of not knowing how to smile. And yes, we all have our bad days. But no matter how hard it is, smiling has been proven to make a person happier. As another wit said: Use your smile to change the world. Dont let the world change your smile.
Humour is infectious and a smile is the prelude to laughter. The sound of roaring laughter is far more contagious than any cough, sneeze or yawn. When laughter is shared, it unites people and increases joy and intimacy. Laughter also triggers healthy physical changes in the body. Humour and a smile which lead up to laughter toughen your immune system, enhance your energy, lessen pain and protect you from the harmful effects of stress. Best of all, this precious remedy is enjoyable, is on the house and has no side effects.
And whether you are interacting with a co-worker, a shop assistant or a check-out cashier, a simple smile can go a long way towards making a person feel appreciated. It turns out, that smiles are also contagious and capable of positively affecting our own moods. Flash a smile, and chances are you will get one in return.
I know at times it can seem impossible, but even forcing a smile can make you feel a little better. And you will definitely feel better when your smiles are reciprocated by happy customers. But a genuine smile, one that comes from the heart, is a gift. It simply cannot be bought, begged, borrowed or badgered.
So you see, in all these service industries as well as in the worlds political and diplomatic firmament there is no doubt that the majority of them simply fake it. I mean they have a plastered almost permanent beam on their mugs that seem to have been passed through a strainer. But a real smile is a curve that usually sets things right even in the most volatile situations. [emailprotected]

Uniteds unbeaten run ends at Huddersfield, City go further clear
LONDON, Saturday: Huddersfield Town stunned Manchester United 2-1 at the John Smiths Stadium on Saturday, a defeat that ended the visitors unbeaten start to the Premier League season and dropped them five points behind leaders Manchester City who beat Burnley 3-0.
Huddersfields victory in driving wind and rain was their first over United since 1952 and all the more unexpected after a run of one goal in six league games.
But the top-tier newcomers fully deserved their first league win since mid-August after hitting United twice in the first half and withstanding everything the visitors - and the appalling weather - threw at them.
Former Manchester City midfielder Aaron Mooy and Laurent Depoitre scored within 33 minutes, with Uniteds afternoon made worse by an injury to Phil Jones. Jose Mourinho responded by bringing on Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marcus Rashford for Juan Mata and Anthony Martial at halftime and Rashford scored his seventh goal of the season to set up a rousing finish in what was the sides first league meeting since 1972.
Mourinho blamed defensive mistakes for the defeat.
A bad team deserved to be punished, he said.
By Manchester Citys recent free-scoring standards, their 3-0 victory over Burnley was modest, with the match turning on a controversial first-half penalty when Bernardo Silva went down theatrically in the area.
TV replays showed minimal contact from Burnley keeper Nick Pope and the Portuguese may find himself in trouble with the three-member FA review panel which looks at simulation and last Friday issued its first retrospective ban on a player for diving.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche said: I had to watch it four times to see contact. But if I contact my kid in the garden I would be amazed if he got that high off the floor. It is amazing how high these players go.
Sergio Aguero converted the penalty to equal Eric Brookes all-time scoring record for the club with his 177th goal. Nicolas Otamendi and Leroy Sane made the scoreline more comfortable as City registered a club-record 11th straight win in all competitions. Elsewhere, Chelsea made up ground on third-placed Tottenham Hotspur, who play Liverpool on Sunday, by beating Watford 4-2 in the days early kickoff at Stamford Bridge. The game was closer than the scoreline suggests, with Marco Silvas impressive side coming from behind to lead at Stamford Bridge before two goals from Michy Batshuayi and another from Cesar Azpilicueta ended the argument.
Pressure will be growing on Stoke City manager Mark Hughes after a disappointing 2-1 home defeat by Bournemouth which left them into the relegation zone.
Hughes had hoped the return of Ryan Shawcross would strengthen his defence after last weeks 7-2 demolition by Manchester City, but Shawcross gave away a penalty, which Junior Stanislas converted and Andrew Surman also found the net.
Mame Biram Diouf narrowed the gap but the goal was not enough to prevent Bournemouth recording their first away league win of the season.
A Federico Fernandez own goal and a second-half strike by Shinji Okazaki gave Leicester City caretaker manager Michael Appleton a much-needed 2-1 win at Swansea City in his first game in charge, lifting the Foxes out of the relegation zone.
But there was no escape for Crystal Palace, whose 1-0 defeat at Newcastle left them rooted to the bottom spot. Mikel Merino scored Newcastles 85th-minute winner.
Southampton also left it late to beat West Bromwich Albion 1-0 in the days evening kickoff but the wait was worth it with substitute Sofiane Boufal beating five men before slotting the ball past Ben Foster for what was Southamptons third league win of the season. Agencies

Wild elephant attacks in Ampara on the rise
Elephant rampages in the border villages of the Ampara district are on the rise and people living in those areas are at risk. The Alayadivembu DS Division in the Ampara district is one of the worst affected areas and residents of the area were in no position to celebrate the Deepavali festival in a peaceful atmosphere due to the fear of elephants.
A herd of elephants entered the village of Santhipuram in the Alayadivembu Division on Friday at midnight, attacking houses and ransacking paddy stocks, rice reserved for daily consumption and other eatables. As the villagers were vigilant at that time, they used the back gates of their houses and saved their lives by hiding in government buildings. The villagers' subsidiary food crop cultivations too were destroyed severely by the elephants.
Residents said that out of the 20 houses of their village that came under attack, six houses were severely damaged. They added that the elephant threat has been there for years and several appeals were made to the respective authorities by them to solve their outstanding problems, but no permanent solutions had yet been taken. Electric fences erected by Wildlife Officials in certain areas are of no use, they lamented.

Wind tunnel test conducted at Capitol TwinPeaks
The 470-apartment Capitol TwinPeaks twin tower project located in Colombo 02 incorporates the latest trends in condominium construction.
Sanken Construction has successfully delivered some truly iconic projects in the past for many developers and Capitol TwinPeaks too is expected to be a triumph of both design and construction.
The project has incorporated the latest technology available in the industry for its design development and construction activities from its rudimentary stage to ensure its structural performance and long-term stability.
In addition, Sanken Construction recently conducted a wind tunnel test for Capitol TwinPeaks despite its high cost to ensure that it delivers the best possible product to its clients.
Determining what the wind loads will be for specific mean recurrence intervals and understanding what the uncertainties are in these loads is critical, which is why Sanken undertook the wind tunnel test for Capitol TwinPeaks, which rises up to 182m and therefore requires an accurate assessment of wind loads on cladding elements to ensure adequate strength.
The main structure of a tall building and its faade must be designed to safely withstand the extreme winds to which the building will be subjected during its expected life.
Since there are no laboratory facilities available in Sri Lanka to perform this test, the wind tunnel test was performed by a renowned wind tunnel testing consultant, CPP Wind Engineering & Air Quality Experts from Australia.
Capitol TwinPeaks stands tall at height of 182 m from ground level making it susceptible to natures extreme conditions. Some of the most fascinating features of Capitol TwinPeaks such as the Sky lounge sunset bar, sky bridge and so on are located at the roof top level.
Through this wind tunnel test, the developer was able to verify how the wind flow patterns surrounding the building effects the building and its contents and necessary rectifications needed to provide safe and pleasant living conditions for residents.
Results obtained from this test were then forwarded to principal structural designer and faade designer to optimize the design.
The presence of Sanken guarantees immense value addition to the ambitious Capitol TwinPeaks project.
Apart from its impeccable track record of delivering projects on time, Sanken Construction infuses the best aesthetic features in the project along with international living standards to set a benchmark in trendy lifestyles.
Moreover, it takes care of all regulatory approvals so that there is no stress on the owner eventually. Its projects always incorporate latest systems, processes and materials. Attention to detail and constant feedback to the developer and in turn to the customers is an added plus.
Capitol Developers Ltd is a member of the reputed construction giant, Sanken Group. In fact, all properties developed by Capitol Developers have been contracted to Sanken Construction, which guarantees timely delivery of the apartments to buyers along with the hallmark construction quality of the Sanken brand.
Capitol TwinPeaks is scheduled to be ready for occupation by end 2020.
