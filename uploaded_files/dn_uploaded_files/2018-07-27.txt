Half-time champions  Mercedes face struggle  in Hungarian heat
Budapest, Wednesday: Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff has admitted that his half-time champions are struggling for supremacy and expects this weekends Hungarian Grand Prix to deliver another closely-fought three-way fight for glory.
Just days after seeing Lewis Hamilton claim one of the greatest wins of his career with an epic rain-soaked triumph in Germany, Wolff conceded that in the cold light of day, we know and recognise that we didnt bring the quickest car to Hockenheim.
And, as a result, he said: We all know that no prizes are given out for half-time champions, so will keep pushing to improve our performance.
After 11 of this years 21 races, Hamilton and Mercedes sit atop the drivers and constructors championships, but only by a narrow margin, and Wolff knows that it will require another special effort in the expected sweltering heat of the Hungaroring for his team to head off for their European summer holidays as leaders.
Hungary will be another tough fight with both Ferrari and Red Bull, he said.
Its a high down-force track and on paper they should both be very fast. However, if theres one thing the German Grand Prix taught us, its that predictions dont determine results.
After struggling for power at recent circuits, the Hungarorings layout and characteristics make Red Bull strong contenders for success because their car has the chassis handling that will enable them to compete at the front.
Daniel Ricciardo won the Monaco Grand Prix this year and has shown on the tight and technical circuits that he has the ability to deliver results, albeit with his team-mate Max Verstappen also representing a serious threat. He won in Hungary in 2014.
The Australian is expected to have his future with Red Bull resolved this weekend and another win, his third of the season, would be a timely confirmation of his and the teams potential.
It would also not be an entirely unwelcome result for Hamilton or Mercedes if it deprives rivals Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari of points in the fight for five titles that has dominated the season to date.
For Ferrari, the race will be overshadowed by the death of former chairman Sergio Marchionne this week as they attempt to bounce back from Vettels crashing, and pointless, exit in the rain last weekend.
Vettels misfortune allowed Hamilton to turn an eight-point deficit into a 17-points lead with his epic win from 14th on the grid. But, he knows too, that despite having won a record five times in Hungary, this weekends contest will not be straightforward.
Its not usually our strongest track, but its not a power circuit so hopefully this extra chunk of power that Ferrari have doesnt serve them as well there and maybe we can have a decent fight.
They have always been really good on tyres its a hot track so, undoubtedly, theyll continue to be fast, but Ive still got high hopes. Ricciardo will go into the weekend well prepared, after taking engine penalties at Hockenheim for strategic reasons, but concerned about the power failure that forced him to retire.

How I became a Disciple of the Buddha
The Buddha in pictures

The life of Siddhartha Gautama, the person we call the Buddha, is shrouded in legend and myth. Although most historians believe there was such a person, we know very little about him. The standard biography appears to have evolved over time. It was largely completed by the Buddhacarita, an epic poem written by Asvaghosa in the second century CE. The following text is based on this poem translated and re-interpreted by Barbara OBrien, a student of Zen Buddhism in New York, and on the stories, our guide Chap told us at Wat Phra That Doi Suthep in Chiang Mai.
Siddhartha Gautamas Birth and Family
The future Buddha, Siddhartha Gautama, was born in the 5th or 6th century BCE in Lumbini (in modern-day Nepal).
Siddhartha is a Sanskrit name meaning one who has accomplished a goal and Gautama is a family name.
His father, King Suddhodana, was the leader of a large clan called the Shakya (or Sakya). Its not clear from the earliest texts whether he was a hereditary king or more of a tribal chief. It is also possible that he was elected to this status.
Suddhodana married two sisters, Maya and Pajapati Gotami. They are said to be princesses of another clan, the Koliya from what is northern India today. Maya was the mother of Siddhartha and he was her only child, dying shortly after his birth. Prajapati, who later became the first Buddhist nun, raised Siddhartha as her own in the city of Kapilavastu.
By all accounts, Prince Siddhartha and his family were of the Kshatriya caste of warriors and nobles. Among Siddharthas more well-known relatives was his cousin Ananda, the son of his fathers brother. Ananda would later become the Buddhas disciple and personal attendant.
He would have been considerably younger than Siddhartha, however, and they didnt know each other as children.
At Wat Doi Suthep, the story of Buddhas life started with a painting of the deity Shakra, riding on his holy elephant Airavata. In Buddhism, Shakra rules over the much sought Devas (which are Buddhist deities) realm of rebirth indicating that Siddhartha Gautamas life is also just one of many lives, part of the reincarnation circle of Buddhist believes. Shakra becomes the guardian deity of Buddha both watching over him and paying homage to his teachings.
The Prophecy and a Young Marriage
When Prince Siddhartha was a few days old, a holy man prophesied over the Prince (by some accounts it was nine Brahmin holy men). It was foretold that the boy would be either a great military conqueror or a great spiritual teacher.
King Suddhodana preferred the first outcome and prepared his son accordingly.
He raised the boy in great luxury and shielded him from knowledge of religion and human suffering. At the age of 16, he was married to his cousin, Yasodhara, who was also 16. This was no doubt a marriage arranged by the families.
Yasodhara was the daughter of a Koliya chief and her mother was a sister to King Suddhodana. She was also a sister of Devadatta, who became a disciple of the Buddha and then, by some accounts, a dangerous rival.
The Four Passing Sights
The Prince reached the age of 29 with little experience of the world outside the walls of his opulent palaces. He was oblivious to the realities of sickness, old age, and death.
One day, overcome with curiosity, Prince Siddhartha asked his charioteer Channa to take him on a series of rides through the countryside. On these journeys he was shocked by the sight of an aged man, then a sick man, and then a corpse. The stark realities of old age, disease, and death seized and sickened the Prince. Finally, he saw a wandering ascetic. The charioteer explained that the ascetic was one who had renounced the world and sought release from the fear of death and suffering.
These life-changing encounters would become known in Buddhism as the Four Passing Sights.
Siddharthas Renunciation
For a time the Prince returned to palace life, but he took no pleasure in it. Even the news that his wife Yasodhara had given birth to a son did not please him. The child was called Rahula, which means fetter.
One night he wandered the palace alone. The luxuries that had once pleased him now seemed grotesque. Musicians and dancing girls had fallen asleep and were sprawled about, snoring and sputtering. Prince Siddhartha reflected on the old age, disease, and death that would overtake them all and turn their bodies to dust.
He realized then that he could no longer be content living the life of a prince. In Wat Doi Suthep this reflection and realization are depicted as Siddharthas first encounter with the demon Mara. In Buddhist cosmology, Mara is associated with death, rebirth and desire.
He is described as the personification of the forces antagonistic to enlightenment and thus tries to keep Siddhartha from being enlightened at all cost. Facing him alone at first, Mara is overcome by Siddhartha who is accompanied by his charioteer Channa, riding his horse Kanthaka.
That very night he left the palace and his hometown Kapilavastu, shaved his head at the river Anoma, and changed from his royal clothes into a beggars robe. Renouncing all the luxury he had known, he began his quest for enlightenment.
Riding Kanthaka, Channa returned Siddharthas accoutrements, weapons and hair to Suddhodanha upon his return to the palace. Following the departure of Siddhartha, Kanthaka died of a broken heart but was reborn as a Brahmin and went on to attend dharma talks by Gautama Buddha so that eventually the former horse of Buddha achieved enlightenment. The death is variously described as occurring either at the banks of the Anoma or upon returning to Kapilavastu.

Career best 4/5 from Joe Root helps Yorkshire win Roses match
LONDON, Wednesday - England Test captain Joe Root finished with a career-best 4-5 as Yorkshire polished off Lancashire in the first hour of day three to win by 118 runs.
Lancashire resumed on 194-6, needing 129 runs to win the Roses match, but Root had Graham Onions caught with the first ball of the day at Old Trafford.
His off-spin claimed Matt Parkinson before Tom Bailey (45) fell, with Root bowling James Anderson to seal victory.Day three lasted less than an hour, Lancashire adding just 10 runs to their overnight total as they were all out for 204.
Division One leaders Surrey bowled out Nottinghamshire on day three to win by an innings and 183 runs and seal their fifth consecutive Championship victory.
After resuming on 57-1, 325 runs short of Surreys first innings total of 592, Notts lost Steven Mullaney (23) early on before Will Fraine went for 30.
Seamer Morne Morkel ended the resistance of Samit Patel (55) as the hosts were reduced to 172-7 at lunch. Spinner Amar Virdi (2-35) helped Morkel (5-60) wrap up the tail.
Surrey took maximum points from their victory at Trent Bridge as they remain unbeaten in the league this season, and are now 43 points ahead of second-placed Notts in the table with a game in hand.
Somerset eventually broke Worcestershires county-record 10th-wicket partnership to win by 141 runs and keep their title hopes alive.
Victory looked imminent after lunch with Division Ones bottom club 165-9, chasing 443 to win at New Road.
Debutant Alex Milton (104 not out) and last man Steve Magoffin (43) resisted for 38 overs in a stand of 136.
But the rearguard action was ended when Craig Overton had Magoffin caught at point by Josh Davey. Victory on day four at New Road moved Somerset up to second in the table, 34 points behind leaders Surrey.
Gloucestershire battled to their second County Championship win of the season despite late resistance from Durham.
Needing 340 for victory, the visitors started the day on 35-0 and openers Tom Latham (45) and Cameron Steel (62) gave them a solid foundation. However, once England all-rounder Ben Stokes was bowled by Matt Taylor (4-31) for nine to leave them at 189-5, hopes of an away win seemed slim.

CB cancels Standard Credit Finance licence
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has decided to cancel the license of the Standard Credit Finance owing to the liquidity crisis which the company had been facing since 2008.
In a public statement issued by the Central Bank, the Banks Monetary Board noted the cancellation of the license was in the best interest of its depositors and other stakeholders.
Depositors of the company have been unable to withdraw their money over the last 10 years. All efforts made to revive the company through different strategies have failed. The continuity of current status will be further detrimental to the interest of depositors and other stakeholders of the company, the statement read.
The directive which comes into effect from 25th of this month would also prevent the finance company from operating, as dictated under the Finance Business Act No 42 of 2011. The company is not permitted to grant new finance/lease facilities either.
The Sri Lanka Deposit Insurance and Liquidity Support Scheme (SLDILSS) will take necessary action to pay compensation to the insured depositors of TSCFL up to a maximum of Rs.600,000/per depositor as per the regulations of the SLDILSS, the statement read. The depositors may be able to recover part of their remaining deposits in the process of liquidation subject to the priority of claims.

Emblem  of bliss
Sakyamuni Gautama the Sambuddha Samma
Brought into focus the priceless sublime Dhamma
Esala signifies the conception of Bosat Siddhartha
Who later became the Perfect one the Thathagatha
On Esala full moon day
Queen Mahamaya had an unusual dream
A baby elephant encircling her with no scream
On Esala full moon day
When Gods reminded, arose from Thusitha heaven
Ten months later the couple was blessed with a son
He mastered all arts and grew up as a royal prince
Married Yasodara and lived happily ever since
Despite fathers precautions, emergence of portends four
Made Bosat embark on his blissful sansaric tour
On Esala full moon day
Giving up luxury, comfort of royal life
Leaving Rahula in the warmth of his wife
At midnight he left the royal palace
The actual event of Renunciation took place
On Esala full moon day
He continued all forms of self Mortification
And achieved Buddhahood through deep meditation
Two months after his supreme enlightenment
He delivered to five ascetics his sermon first
On Esala full moon day
They were determined not to take any notice
But it was not possible, they stood up right at once
The Buddha requested listen carefully my friends
You have not yet reached the end
On Esala full moon day
He delivered his first sermon in Deer Park
Hoping to relieve the humanity from the dark
There he set the Wheel of Dhamma in motion
To put them across the Sansaric ocean
On Esala full moon day
His first sermon was at Migadaye Isipatana
It is none other than Sutta Dhamma Chakka Pavattana
Devas saluted and worshipped, Sadu, Sadu
Earth was amazed Budures radiated
Ven. Kodanna became the first Arahat
Buddha, Dhamma and now Sangha are the topmost
Universe now blessed with Triple Gem in Buddhist arena
Was a great historic event in Buddha Sasana
On Esala full moon day
This is of great significance for another reason
Because this marked the beginning of the Vas Season
First Vassana was observed by Buddha and his disciples
Which tradition is continued to date on principle
On Esala full moon day
In Thusitha heaven in the 7th year of Buddhahood
With Abhi Dhamma Mathru Diyaraja was honoured
To Sri Lanka this Poya bears special importance
Because a series of events connected to sasana took place
On Esala full moon day
Most precious-Lanka was blessed with Tooth Relic sacred
Brought by Dantha and Hemamala with meththa devoid of hatred
The most venerated Tooth Relic and its exposition
Was followed by the first ever Dalada procession
On Esala full moon day
To this day tradition down the years continue
That Kandy Perahera is held in this Holy venue
This tradition continues with pomp and grandeur
When Buddhists islandwide celebrate it August every year
On Esala full moon day
Yet another with alien rule, in Vinaya and discipline
In Sangha there was an alarming decline
Saranankara Ven. Thera the most erudite
Effected a great Religious Revival with far sight
On Esala full moon day
Ven. Thera not only set up pure ordination
But also we owe trim the Triple Gem and its preservation
He passed away in Kandy in 1778
On Esala full moon day

England weigh options ahead of India opener
LONDON, Thursday: England could name an extended squad for their 1,000th Test when selection chief Ed Smith unveils on Thursday the group chosen for next next weeks series opener against India at Edgbaston.
But while Smith has already shown himself to be unconventional by recalling Jos Buttler purely on the basis of the batsmans form in the Indian Premier League for the preceding drawn Test series at home to Pakistan -- Smiths first as a selector -- it would still be a surprise if leg-spinner Adil Rashid was included for the India opener.
The Yorkshireman, who unlike Buttler has opted out of red-ball domestic cricket to concentrate on the limited overs game ahead of next years World Cup in England, was in fine form during the recent 2-1 one-day international series win over India.
In particular, the way Rashid starred in Englands series-clinching win at his Headingley home ground last week, where he bowled India captain and star batsman Virat Kohli with a classic leg-break sparked a debate about whether he would get the nod for Edgbaston.
But leaving aside the thorny question of what including Rashid would say to all those cricketers trying to gain an England Test place as a result via the traditional method of toiling in the County Championship, it is not as if England are devoid of spin options.
Off-spinner Moeen Ali, who also bowled well during the one-dayers, returned to red-ball form with five for 107 for Worcestershire against Somerset in the latest round of Championship matches after a miserable Ashes tour of Australia
Left-armer Jack Leach started the season as Englands first-choice Test spinner but injury allowed Somerset team-mate Dom Bess, an off-spinner, to make his debut against Pakistan at Lords.
Yet Bess arguably impressed more as a batsman than a bowler and this week he was left out by Somerset in favour of Leach for the Worcestershire match.
Meanwhile James Anderson and Stuart Broad are set to take the new ball once again.
However, with five Tests in just six weeks, the depth of Englands pace bowling resources could be tested.
Chris Woakes, fit after knee and thigh injuries, will hope for a Test recall at his Edgbaston home ground, while seam-bowling all-rounder Ben Stokes provides another option.
Stokes, however, is set to miss the second Test at Lords because of a clash with his Bristol court appearance on a charge of affray, which he denies.
In an era where many touring teams complain about a lack of warm-up matches, India decided to reduce their schedule four-day game against Essex to three before play started at Chelmsford on Wednesday so they could spend more time at Edgbaston.
Instead of an extra day here, I think an extra day (of training) there would be more valuable, explained Ravi Shastri, the India coach.
More familiarity with the venue and the conditions where you are playing the first Test, the former all-rounder added.  AFP

Special Corruption High Courts:
FIRST INDICTMENT AGAINST GAMINI SENARATH
The Attorney General yesterday filed indictments against the former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath and three others in the first special corruption High Court established to try high-profile financial fraud and corruption cases.
This is for illegally investing Rs. 500 million of Public Funds at Helanco Hotels and Spa. The funds had been originally given by Litro Gas Company to Canwill Holdings Ltd.
Gamini Senarath, former Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Managing Director Piyadasa Kudabalage, former Samurdhi Commissioner Neil Bandara Hapuwinna and Lasantha Bandara had been charged regarding the offences under the Public Property Act, Penal Code and Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The investigation reports pertaining to these offences have been forwarded to Chief Justice Priyasath Dep for his approval prior to the Attorney Generals decision to file indictments against the accused. According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding this incident, the four accused have been accused of misusing Government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012.
The prosecution maintained that Canwill Holdings Ltd is a state-owned public enterprise set up during the former regime with Rs. 18.5 billion in equity secured from its major shareholders, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which invested Rs. 8.5 billion and Litro Gas and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) with Rs. 5 billion each.
The funds in question had been the allocation for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel, to be constructed by Canwill Holdings Ltd, a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but had instead been invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.
The Attorney General has listed 92 documents as production items in the case and a further 63 individuals have been named as witnesses.

Genesis of traditions
If Vesak is important because Prince Siddhattha was born, then Esala is equally important as the prince was conceived in Queen Mahamaya. If Vesak is important because of the Buddhas awakening, then Esala is equally important as Siddhartha left all his luxuries for an ascetic life; this is when his son Rahula was born.
Queen Maya was born to King Anjana and Queen Yasodhara of the Koliya caste. That night she dreamt of gods, arrived from four directions, take her to lake Anotatta. She was bathed and donned in heavenly garb and jewellery. A white baby elephant, after circling around her three times, entered her body. As it is famously known, King Sudhodhanas prophets predicted this as a sign of a great beings arrival. The baby was conceived while the queen was on the way to her mothers.
The queens death, which occurred seven days after the princes birth, has caused contention. Some misunderstand that this took place as a result of the princes birth. The prince verified five factors, which included the mothers age-span, before expiring for his last birth. Queen Mahamayas life was any way spanned only up to 40, and when a princely sage is born, that particular womb would not be suitable for another being.
Rahula, the son of Siddhartha and Yasodhara, was born after a long time the couple got married. When the news was brought, the prince uttered: A fetter (Rahula) has been born, a bondage has been born," and this is how the wee prince got his name. Some scripts believe he was named after a lunar eclipse (Rahu) that might have occurred around the time of his birth. Whatever it is, the little prince made his father take that giant leap, and life to become harder later on. Towards evening Siddhartha finally decided to leave, taking one last look at Rahula and his mother in a peaceful slumber. But mothers arm was covering the childs face protectively  just as if to inspire him to go ahead with the decision.
Leaving the mansions
King Suddhodana did not ever want his son to leave the throne. It is common knowledge that the prince was given three palaces to spend the different seasons and the common mans life is kept out of his sight. Siddhattha was already surrounded by the sights of pleasure: beautiful women, dancers, singers and musicians.
But all this only made the prince curious about life. One day while sentries are in deep slumber, the prince is said to have taken a tour of the city with his ally Channa. Then, the scriptures state, deities have sent him the four ominous signs. And then he was determined to leave for sanctity. Another day, the day his son was born, Siddattha renounced. Legend has it that he cut off his hair and threw it up to the sky. Deities from the thirty-three heavens got hold of that and offered saffron robes worn. He exchanged his royal garments with a deity, as scriptures relate. Prince Siddhatta thus became an ascetic.
The little prince in the meanwhile knew his father was in robes, but his grandfather took every step to give him a proper education. No one can say the Buddha neglected his fatherly duties. He was particularly concerned about the moral education of his son in robes. He put him directly under Sariputta and Moggallana. Genes do wonders, and Rahula could grasp anything in a second. He was always concerned about his teachers instructions. The Buddha was happy about him, and named him as the monk most concerned about training. He gave his entire heritage, no matter how little his son is.
Prince Siddhattha is much scoffed at, mostly among non-Buddhists, for leaving his son and wife when they needed his warm company. The question is what would happen if he did change mind seeing his own babys face  Siddhartha, by all odds, was a 29-year robust young man. Some say the prince left the palace in the broad daylight when everybody was up. In that case, everyone must have attempted to make him stay. Suddhodanas palace would have looked like a funeral. Becoming a monk, ironically or sadly, is still considered a bad option in many families, unless they have financial issues. Siddhartha had no hard feelings about his small family. A poet sees the Buddhas giant step in that way:
Twas not through hatred of children sweet,
Twas not through hatred of His lovely wife,
Whether he left in the broad daylight or at the night in secrecy, is still a mystery.
First discourse
Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta comes in the 56th chapter of Samyutta Nikaya of Sutta Pitaka. In English Dhamma can mean nature or the Buddhas teachings. In this case, it is the Buddhas teachings, and Dhamma Cakka is the wheel of the Buddhas teachings. Pavattana is setting in motion. The sutta is thus named because it was the Buddhas first discourse, hence its the starting point of a long mission. Wikipedia introduces a list of English translation by authoritative scholars:
1. Setting in Motion the Wheel of the Dhamma (Bodhi, 2000, pp. 18437)
2. Setting in Motion the Wheel of Truth (Piyadassi, 1999)
3. Setting Rolling the Wheel of Truth (anamoli, 1993)
4. Setting the Wheel of Dhamma in Motion (Thanissaro, 1993)
After enlightenment and the invitation to preach his teachings, the Buddha scanned the world for a being who should be taught first. This is his show of gratitude. He realizes his first teachers - though their teachings did not help in the enlightenment - Alara Kalama and Uddakaramaputta are dead. Then he examines the five ascetics who helped him.
The ascetics accept only the extreme of self-mortification. This is why they left Siddattha when he took up the middle path. They saw their erstwhile companion approaching towards them, and they had a resolution not to attend to him.
But things took a different shape when the Buddha got closer. They noted something different, positive. They just forgot about their resolution and attended to him with care. In the discourse, the Buddha warns the ascetics against the two extremes: pleasure and mortification, and praised the middle path.
The Buddha introduces four noble truths and the noble eightfold path to explain the middle path. The path leads to the right path of the journey of which the destination is enlightenment and Nibbana. The revelation was simple - basically the four noble truths - yet it was so deep to grasp. The truths, the Buddha explained, must be achieved through three aspects: recognizing, pursuing and fully achieving.
Only Kondanna, of the five ascetics, could attain the first sainthood.

Germany pledges  long-lasting, fair business
Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake, German Ambassador Jorn Rohde and the German Industry and Commerce (AHK) committed themselves to equitable and strong bilateral business ties.
We want to ensure our Sri Lankan partners that we see each other on the same level, said AHK Chief Delegate in Sri Lanka Andreas Hergenrother.
The business relationship between Germany and Sri Lanka spans many decades and is an important one, said the State Minister. He was presenting the Freudenberg book to the AHK and the German Ambassador during a ceremony. Upon receiving the book, the German emissaries emphasised their commitment to long-lasting and fair business relationships.
The book, a historical document from 1873, is a record of the Freudenberg Company and its founder Philip Freudenberg, who was appointed as Consul of the German Empire in Ceylon in 1873. The Freudenberg book capitalises on the almost 150 year-old history of German-Sri Lankan business. Ambassador Rohde told State Minister Senanayake that the Freudenberg book, not only symbolises your family business history but also a German tradition which started here in 1873. They are all involved in the Sri Lankan business history.
Incidentally, State Minister Senenayakes family had revived the Freudenberg Company in 1953, which is how he came to possess the book.
The event also addressed the future of German-Sri Lankan business relations, quoting trade increases from 2017: German exports to Sri Lanka increased by 81 percent, and Sri Lankan imports to Germany increased by 13 percent, reaching a bilateral trade volume of 1.25 billion Euro.
The book presentation was followed by the signing of the DIMO-AHK Sri Lanka Premier Platinum Partnership. Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC had achieved platinum partnership status after contributing more than Rs. 3 million per year to German Industry and Commerce.

Government usurping PC powers   SP Chief Minister
Since the establishment of provincial councils 30 years ago, all governments, with the support of government heads, including the architect of the system, have attempted to take back devolved powers which had been constitutionally ensured, back to the central government, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
During the past three decades, they were in the practice of getting back a number of political, legislative and administrative powers by the right hand that they had offered by their left hand, he said.
He was speaking as chief guest at the opening of the Dhakshina International Book Fair at the Galle Town Hall, on Wednesday.
The book fair, organised by the Southern Development Authority for the second consecutive year, was inaugurated following a function held under the patronage of the chief minister. Indian Consul General in Hambantota, Prem K. Nair also took part in the event as a special invitee.
The book fair was held under the theme Book Springtime of the South with the objective of crafting a generation which has made knowledge its wealth, and will continue till Sunday (29).
Through various legislative amendments made to the Constitution by way of Acts of Parliament, the central government has infringed the constitutional empowerment that the Parliamentary system of government introduced to the provinces, the chief minister said.
The contemporary Gamperaliya project launched islandwide through district secretariats focusing on village development is the latest such manoeuvre which interferes with the scope of provincial council powers. Under the Gamaperaliya project, many economic activities that come under the purview of the provincial council are handled by the Centre, making fiscal devolution a centralised rather than a provincial responsibility, he said.
Since the inception of the provincial councils, the Centre held a dominant position over the peripheral system of government in making financial allocations to the councils. On many occasions, we suffered greatly due to the delays in getting our financial allocations from the Centre. When we get the funds at the end of the year, many of our planned economic programmes are hampered. The Centres control over marginalised provincial finances is one of the main factors that have constrained the performance of economic activities, the chief minister said.
However, despite such obstacles, we have been able to deliver our services to the people of the province to the best of our ability. We have launched many creative initiatives for the progress of the province and the people, he added.
The Dhakshina International Book Fair is one such constructive project we launched. I think that the Southern Provincial council is the only such provincial authority that launched an international book fair, after the one held in Colombo, he said.

Govt. implements systematic  poverty alleviation plans: President
It is everyone's responsibility to alleviate poverty among the people through the systematic implementation of poverty alleviation plans and programmes implemented by the government, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President said so presiding over a meeting of the Sabaragamuwa Province operations committee Grama Shakthi People's Movement, held at the Provincial Council auditorium in Ratnapura on July 25.
The operation of the Grama Shakthi People's Movement in Sabaragamuwa and its progress and future plans were discussed at length during this meeting.
Special attention was also drawn towards finding instant solutions to problems encountered by the people in the region.
President Sirisena, who promised to release funds for the implementation of a proposal to build a day-night trading park with trade stalls in Kegalle town, added that steps would be taken to release Rs. 25 million out of the total expenditure of Rs. 65 involved, next week. The President also promised to release funding for the implementation of other proposals made for the development of the Ratnapura district. Attention was also drawn towards problems faced by industrialists due to the lack of a proper market for kithul-based products and the President intervened to resolve that problem too.
An MoU was also signed on this day in this connection between the Kudawa Sinharaja Tourist Service and Kithul Products Grama Shakthi Janatha Samithi and Cargills Ltd.
Attention was also drawn at this meeting towards problems faced by fruit cultivators in the region and it was agreed to devise a strategy to introduce new technology for the preservation of fruits and introduce a local and foreign market for fruit products.
At this meeting, the President also handed over the first instalment of funding entitled for Grama Shakthi Janatha Samithis in the two districts of Sabaragamuwa to the respective Government Agents. The Ratnapura district received Rs. 51 million while Kegalle received Rs. 33 million on this occasion.
Ministers Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, Thalatha Athukorale and Kabir Hashim, State Minister Champika Premadasa, Deputy Ministers Dushmantha Mithrapala, Dinesh Gankanda and Karunaratne Paranavithane, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake and Parliamentarians Thusitha Wiyemanne, Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Sandith Samarasinghe and Tharaka Balasuriya, other people's representatives, Divisional Secretaries and officials were also present on the occasion.
After the conclusion of the meeting, President Sirisena visited the Ganegama Grama Shakthi Production Village in Pelmadulla and interacted with the people, looking into their problems.
Ganegama, situated 15 kilometres off the Ratnapura town, is inhabited by 521 families whose main livelihood is agriculture. President Sirisena's visit brought great solace to the people in the village as they were able to find on-the-spot solutions to many of their problems due to the availability of public officials accompanying the President.
A rural development plan drawn up after an analysis of people's problems was also presented to the President on this occasion, a press release by the Presidents Media Division said.

Hetmyer hundred as Windies level Bangladesh series
PROVIDENCE, THURSDAY: Shimron Hetmyer scored a superb century as Bangladesh stumbled in the final over to hand the West Indies a series-levelling victory in their one-day game here Wednesday.
The hosts made it 1-1 in the best-of-three series after Bangladesh failed to score eight runs off their final over for what would have been a series win.
Shimron Hetmyer blazed 125 off 93 balls to pace the home side to a competitive 271 all out batting first.
Bangladesh were left stranded on 268 for six after their 50 overs as West Indies held on for a three-run win. West Indies captain Jason Holder, who started the innings by conceding 20 runs and whose final analysis of one for 66 was the most expensive ever by a Caribbean bowler in an ODI against Bangladesh, bowled the 50th over to give the hosts the victory.
Holders first delivery accounted for topscorer Mushfiqur Rahim for 68 via a catch on the midwicket boundary and he conceded just four runs off the remaining five deliveries to celebrate a result with his teammates which leaves the series to be decided in the final match on Saturday in St Kitts.
We just had to hang in there and believe in ourselves, said the delighted captain after the match. Bangladesh came at us hard and credit to them for the way they batted at the top. But we didnt give up and it really sets things up for the final match. Yet it should never have come to the final over drama, especially after the flying start in which Bangladesh raced to their fastest-ever fifty in ODIs - off 4.4 overs - and were 71 for one by the seventh over and apparently cruising.

A Hindu priest who was held in remand custody regarding a case where five accused have been charged with aiding and abetting an LTTE suicide cadre charged with attempting to assassinate the former Defence Secretary was ordered to be acquitted and released from the case by the Colombo High Court.
The accused was acquitted and released from the case on the basis that there is no sufficient evidence against the accused to prove him guilty.
Colombo High Court Judge Sampath Abeykoon made this order following the findings that the confession made by the accused Sriskandarajah to the Terrorism Investigations Division was not made voluntarily. The Attorney General also admitted that apart from the questionable confession, there is no other evidence against the accused.
In this case, the Attorney General had filed indictments against five accused on charges of conspiring with the suicide cadre and assisting him to carry out the suicide bomb attack which killed two army officers and injured several others.The former Defence Secretary escaped unhurt.
A LTTE suicide cadre attempted to drive an explosive laden vehicle into former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapakse's motorcade at Pittala Junction in Colpetty on December 1, 2006.

Ian Paisley owes apology to Lankan HR victims - Amnesty
Ian Paisley still owes an apology to Sri Lankan victims of human rights abuses after lobbying on behalf of the countrys brutal regime, according to Amnesty International.
The North Antrim MP was last week found to have performed paid advocacy on behalf of the Sri Lankan regime, which picked up the bill for two lavish family holidays in 2013.
The DUP MP wrote to the then prime minister David Cameron the following year urging him not to support a United Nations investigation into human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.
Paisley did not register the trips with Parliament, which requires MPs to register visits to any destination which may relate to political activities in their role as MP.
Amnesty Internationals regional head Patrick Corrigan said the DUP MP had attempted to stand in the way of international justice.
Ian Paisley has apologised for not registering his lavish holidays but still owes an apology to the tens of thousands of Sri Lankan citizens who were left bereaved or suffered not just at the hands of the government, but also the Tamil Tigers.
Paisley claimed the absence of personal gain meant he had a more objective view on the Sri Lankan conflict than MPs sympathetic to the islands Tamil community.
In correspondence with Westminsters commissioner for standards in September 2017, Paisley said his interest in Sri Lanka stemmed from its parallels with Northern Ireland and the 40-year war against IRA terrorism.
As someone heavily involved in conflict resolution in my own country and in African states, I take a keen interest in the Sri Lanka conflict resolution, he said in the letter to the commissioner for standards.
The North Antrim MP said his experience would have been useful to the Sri Lankan authorities.
I have no doubt that my well-established knowledge of terrorism and post-conflict activities was of interest to the Sri Lanka government, as they could speak to someone with authority on the subject matter, he said.
He said he had long-held and well-established views on Sri Lanka, which had been criticised by Labour MPs largely because they have a Tamil electorate in their constituencies.
I have no such pressures  my views are not influenced in any way by any voting section in North Antrim, he said.
The fact is that I am much more objective on this subject than those who would seek to criticise me, given that I have no electoral or personal gain to make by expressing my opinions on Sri Lanka.
The North Antrim MP also claimed to have had significant arrangements with national oil suppliers in Oman or Nigeria  both countries with dubious human rights records.
In emails leaked to the Daily Telegraph and published by Westminsters Standards Committee last week, Paisley talks of a dinner with a Sri Lankan government official where we discussed a potential oil purchase.
Let me know your requirements, as you know this is the most lucrative project you could be involved in and government-to-government arrangement will attract the most discount, he said in his February 2013 email to the official. (Irish Times)

Iconic Green Cabin to shut down
The iconic Colombo restaurant - Green Cabin - known to at least five generations, is to close its doors permanently on Tuesday, July 31.
The property in Colombo 3, has been sold to a leading blue chip in Colombo.
It was originally opened in 1936 by Mrs de Vos, who opted to sell the business in 1942, soon after the Japanese air raids.
The late entrepreneur Cyril Rodrigo, of Pagoda fame, saw a lucrative business opportunity and bought it.
Both Pagoda and Green Cabin kept open during World War II and reaped the harvest.
Over the years, it was a popular venue for eating out and takeaways.
A recent change in the management of the family-owned company has resulted in the new directors wanting to sell the business.
Employees are to be transferred to the outdoor catering unit in Pepiliyana.

Jailed drug dealers, criminals using satellite phones-Intelligence sources reveal
The Special Task Force Intelligence Unit has also found out that imprisoned drug dealers and underworld criminals who are billionaires are using satellite mobile phones.
According to these revelations, the drug dealers who are sentenced to death are communicating with other drug dealers and criminals in foreign countries using satellite phones.
Satellite mobile phone use is limited to the privileged class and not available for ordinary citizens.
The Intelligence Unit suspects that satellite phones are in operation not only at the Welikada Prison, but also at other prisons as well. They also believe that some of the prison guards are aware of this illegal action.
They also believe that some of the prison guards are providing this equipment to prison inmates in exchange for huge sums of money as bribes.
The Intelligence Units have also unraveled that close to 3000-4000 communications are done during a month from the Welikada Prison to outer locations.
According to them, these communications are done with regards to drug dealing, criminal activities and other rackets.
The communications are yet untraceable, the Intelligence Unit sources also said.
While the Intelligence Units are trying to infiltrate this communication network, the racketeers are using their billions in wealth to use high-tech communication devices to make their communications untraceable.
The Intelligence Units have also unveiled that persons who are wanted by the Police including Udayanga Weeratunga are allegedly communicating by using the same devices.

Ledecky eases into US championships with 800m free win
Irvine, Thursday: World record-holder Katie Ledecky cruised to victory in the 800m freestyle at the US swimming championships on Wednesday to lock down a berth for the Pan Pacific Championships next month.
Ledecky, owner of the top 10 times ever posted in the event, was under world record pace through 350 meters, but settled for a comfortable victory in 8min 11.98 sec -- well outside the world record of 4:08.79 she set at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
Usually it takes me a few races to get into these meets, so (I) knew that was going to be the case probably, said Ledecky, whose four victories in Rio took her tally of Olympic gold medals to five.
The 21-year-old American was confident she would find more speed before the Pan Pacs in Tokyo August 9-14.
I felt pretty smooth throughout, she said. I never really was able to change gears. Ill get back to work and find ways to be better in a couple of weeks.
While Ledecky was easing into the meet -- a qualifier not only for Pan Pacs but also for next years world championships in South Korea -- Hali Flickinger capped a career day with a victory in the 200m butterfly.
Flickinger, 24, sliced almost a full second of her lifetime best in the heats with a time of 2:05.87.
She broke the US Open record of 2:05.96 set by Mary T. Meagher in 1981 in becoming the third-fastest US woman ever.
She couldnt quite reproduce that in the final, but she held on to win in 2:06.14, with Katie Drabot second in 2:07.18 and Regan Smith third in 2:07.42.
I definitely think it is a step in the right direction, Flickinger said. I definitely know theres more in the tank. That just showed me that its going to come.
Blake Pieroni, 22, stormed home to beat 2012 Olympic champion Nathan Adrian in the 100m freestyle in 48.08sec.
Adrian, who also owns four Olympic relay golds, was philosophical.
In a race like that youre just racing for places, said Adrian, who was second in 48.25sec and like Ledecky thought hed find more speed heading into Tokyo.
Usually I do get a little faster with that extra two weeks of rest, he said.
Townley Haas was third in 48.30 and Zachary Apple fourth in 48.34. Caeleb Dressel, who won the 100m free as part of his seven-gold haul at the world championships in Budapest last year, finished sixth in 48.50.
He was entered in seven more events this week, so still had plenty of chances to make the Pan Pacs, where he could yet secure a 100m free berth at the 2019 worlds. Adrian said Dressel, who inked his first sponsorship deal with Speedo last week, was adjusting to his departure from the US collegiate amateur ranks at the right time, with the 2020 Tokyo Olympics still two years away.
Its certainly not the best that weve seen from Caeleb (but) hes going to be down to 47-low as early as next year, Adrian said.
World and Olympic champion Simone Manuel notched a dominant victory in the womens 100m free in 52.54, with Mallory Comerfords second in 53.09 and Margo Geer third in 53.44.
Justin Wright surged from seventh place at the halfway stage -- fifth at the final turn -- to win the mens 200m fly in 1:54.63. Zach Harting was second in 1:55.11 and 16-year-old Gianluca Urlando and Jack Conger tied for third in 1:55.21.

The minister said that a bumper rice harvest of around 1.4 million metric tons is expected this season and the Paddy Marketing Board (PMB) is ready to purchase 120,000 metric tons of paddy from the Yala harvest. Commenting on the market price of the paddy, the minister said that PMB plans to buy nadu and samba rice at Rs.38 and Rs.41 per kilo, respectively. He further said that that the government has already allocated sufficient funds for purchasing paddy.
But the PMB will purchase only quality paddy which has a moisture rate of less than 14 percent, he added.
The minister said that the PMB will enter the domestic rice market shortly under the brand of PMB rice and hopes to sell high-quality rice varieties at an affordable price while maintaining a steady price for paddy.
PMB Chairman Upali Mohotti and Dr. W.M.W. Weerakoon from the ministry were also present.

The Moragahakanda - Kaluganga project will turn a new leaf in the countrys development history though the government had been failed to market it, unlike the previous government, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
The Minister made this observation yesterday during the press conference held to announce the water filling ceremony of the Kaluganga reservoir on July 23, to be held under the the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
He said parallel to this project, the construction of the Moragahakanda-Kaluganga tunnel will begin the same day. Power generated by the Moragahakanda project would be connected to the national grid.
This is some kind of a miracle, Minister Amaraweera said. This project was initiated during the 1994-2000 period when President Maithripala Sirisena was the Mahaweli Minister. The entire project is Rs 230,000 million while the Kaluganga project is Rs 101,120 million.
Minister Amaraweera said the project loan could be settled with the profit accrued.This project would create thousands of employment opportunities in the country.The fisheries industry, agriculture and the power generation could save immensely for the country, he said.
He said compensation and two acres was offered for those who lost their lands due to the implementation of this project.Towns are being set up with modern hospital, school, shopping complex for the people who have been resettled.The people would also get quality drinking water and it is a great solace to them since they come from an area where the kidney disease was rampant.
The people will also be provided with water for both the seasons and for cultivation in between.
Minister Amaraweera further said the country imports 44,000 metric tonnes of fruits, ginger and turmeric worth of Rs 1,315 million, oranges worth of Rs. 158 million, cashew worth of Rs 750 million and peanuts worth of Rs 680 million.Farmers can cultivate them there saving the money that flows out of the country, Minister said.

Nearly 250 dead in I.S. attacks on Syria
LEBANON: The death toll in coordinated Islamic State group suicide bombings and shootings in southern Syria rose to nearly 250 overnight, more than half of them civilians, a monitor said Thursday.
Wednesdays attacks hit Sweida, a Druze-majority province mostly held by the government which had remained relatively insulated from the countrys seven-year civil war.
The death toll climbed steadily throughout the day and into the night, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group, said. The toll is now 246 people dead, including 135 civilians, said Observatory chief Rami Abdel Rahman.
The others killed were pro-government fighters or residents who had taken up arms to defend their villages.
The toll keeps rising as civilians who were wounded are dying and people who were unaccounted for are found dead, Abdel Rahman told AFP.
The onslaught began with a triple suicide bombing in the city of Sweida, which was followed by attacks with guns and explosives on villages to its north and east.
A fourth blast hit the provincial capital later in the day.
IS claimed the assault hours later. At least 45 Jihadists died carrying it out, the Observatory said.
It was the worst bloodshed to hit Sweida province since the civil war began in 2011.
Syrian state media reported deadly attacks on Sweida and surrounding villages but did not give a specific toll. - AFP

Northern lands acquired by the military:
Over 5,160 acres released to owners
The three Armed Forces have released a total of 5,160.59 acres of land in the North and the East to their original owners last year, the Defence Ministry Performance Report for the year 2017 has revealed.
The report was tabled in Parliament last week. Out of that 4,318 acres were state land while 842 acres were private land.
According to the report, 4811.34 acres of lands in the Northern Province and 349.25 acres of land in the Eastern Province occupied by the Three Forces have been returned to the original owners last year.
The Army has released 4,981.36 acres, the Navy 79.37 acres and the Air Force 99.86 acres in the North and the East. The returning of land to their original owners is part of the Governments reconciliation and resettlement drive. The Defence Ministry provides assistance to re-establish the required camps.
The report stated that 54.29 acres of more land in the two Provinces are proposed to be released in 2018, out of which 47.50 acres are private land. Necessary measures will be taken to release the maximum amount of lands which occupied by the Three Forces in Northern and Eastern Provinces to the original owners. The amount of land returned will be amended on the requirements arising from time to time, the report stated.
The Army earlier confirmed that they have received part of the funds from the Ministry of Rehabilitation to relocate military camps and as soon as the balance is received, it will be able to release most of the remaining lands to their owners. The military has asked the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry for around Rs. 880 million to relocate military installations in privately owned lands. Officials say that in some cases, even though the military has already released the lands, the owners could not get back immediately as there was no housing infrastructure. The Rehabilitation Ministry has estimated that nearly 30,000 more houses would be needed to complete resettlement. Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan and several other peoples representatives have held talks with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to seek the release of more lands to the original owners. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have stressed that national security will not be compromised in the process of returning the lands. They have pointed that there will be no overall reduction of the military infrastructure in the North.
The Army has however said that it is undergoing a process of rightsizing its troops in order to meet the different demands of peacetime and rejected reports that it was withdrawing many camps from the North. This process does not allow any Army camp to be closed, but it instead enables the majority of troops in those camps be deployed for emergency disaster needs and nation-building tasks in an effective manner. Nevertheless, some false media reports try to claim that this process has led to a large let-up in the security arrangements in the North and East. It certainly is not a disbanding of battalions, but is only a restructuring with the intention of distributing human and material resources equally among other battalions. Sri Lanka Army under any circumstances will not resort to any decisions that would pose a threat to national security. It is therefore emphasized that the Sri Lanka Army as a responsible one will not close down any Army camp as alleged in those misleading reports, it said in a news release.

Over 600 expatriate workers die  abroad annually
Over 600 Sri Lankan expatriate workers die annually while working abroad, said Foreign Affairs State Minister Wasantha Senanayake.
He was addressing an awareness programme for regional politicians and officials in Polonnaruwa, recently.
Initial discussions were also held during this programme on measures to open a ministry consular mobile service in Polonnaruwa for the convenience of Sri Lankan expatriate workers and their families.
This would enable them to get their official matters attended to locally by saving time and unnecessary hassle involved in travelling to Colombo for such work.
Polonnaruwa GA Ranjith Ariyaratne and other officials were present.

PC Polls: No decision yet on electoral system
Party Leaders have failed to reach a final agreement on whether the Provincial Council Elections should be held under the old or new electoral system, despite several rounds of meetings over the past few months,
The Party Leaders Meeting held yesterday morning at the Parliament Complex also ended inconclusively, Parliament sources said. However, reverting to the old electoral system had been discussed and party leaders except those representing the SLFP and JVP had been in agreement with it.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was absent as he was undertaking a foreign visit. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe chaired the meeting attended by all party leaders.
Ministers Nimal Siripala de Silva and Faiszer Musthapha and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna participated in the meeting representing the SLFP, while Ministers Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Kabir Hashim participated representing the UNP along with the PM.
As there was no final decision, the Party Leaders decided to meet again next Wednesday (August 1).
Speaking to the Daily News JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake said his party prefers the new electoral system sans preferential votes which was used in the recent LG Poll. MP Dissanayake had argued that reverting to the old system would mean a waste of all the deliberations and efforts made to introduce the new system.
The UNP Working Committee which met on Wednesday discussed extensively the possibility of holding the PC Elections under the old electoral system to avoid further delay.
The elections for the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa PCs are already due, and the term of another three PCs namely the Central, Northern and North Western is due to end by September. Party Leaders on July 20 agreed to schedule the PC elections on January 5, 2019 if Parliament could arrive at an agreement on matters relating to the elections before November.

People unite when they understand each other: PM
Sri Lanka could come forward as a peaceful and developed nation when its people become competent in two official languages of the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was addressing the gathering at the ceremony presided by President Maithripala Sirisena to appreciate the students who achieved distinction passes for Sinhala and Tamil from the "If you know, teach, if you do not know, learn" radio programme 2017. The programme aimed at uniting the broken hearts through implementing the official language policy. The ceremony organised by the National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Ministry was held at the Sugathadasa Indoor Stadium.
The Prime Minister said the countries like Singapore made three languages official to bring about peace in the country. Singapore is a developed country now. He said Malaysia was in conflict in 1960s., but it had developed now."We were far ahead of them those days," the Prime Minister said.
He said Sri Lanka faced Black July in 1983 and thereafter a war. The war ended but we could not bring in reconciliation. "We have been lagging behind while the rest was going forward," the Prime Minister said."We hope unity among communities would strengthen with these programs," the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister said he read a letter by a student named Shanka Chathuranga. "He has written that the country is developing and our environment is now beautiful," the Prime Minister said. "He says all must unite disregarding their languages, religions and other differences. Language is the bridge to unity," the Prime Minister said.
National Integration, Reconciliation and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan spoke. Deputy Minister Seyed Ali Zahir Moulana and Minister Arjuna Ranatunga were present.

Proteas register first win on tour  win one-day warm-up
Skipper Faf du Plessis hit an attractive 71 off 60 balls with 10 fours and a six and Reeza Hendricks and Willem Mulder chipped in with useful half-centuries to help South Africa beat Sri Lanka Board XI 63 runs in their one-day warm-up match played at the P Sara Oval yesterday.
It was the Proteas first win on the tour having drawn their two-day warm-up game and then lost the two Tests to Sri Lanka.
Winning the toss and batting first South Africa hit an impressive 293 despite losing Quinton de Kock to the third ball of the innings for a duck and half the side for 125 by the 20th over. But David Miller (40), Hendricks (59) and Mulder (56) made useful contributions down the order to get South Africa to a competitive total.
Sri Lanka Board began their reply badly losing Shehan Jayasuriya for one in the first over before recovering through a second wicket stand of 60 between Dimuth Karunaratne and skipper Dhananjaya de Silva.
Karunaratne continued his Test form into the one-day format by scoring an impressive half century off 57 balls with five fours. De Silva was dismissed for 36.
Sri Lanka lost their way in the middle order and slumped to 140-7 before a stand of 63 between Isuru Udana (53 off 52 balls inclusive of 5 fours, 3 sixes) and Prabath Jayasuriya (21) lifted them to over 200 but they were still quite a long way short of the required target and were dismissed in the 42nd over for 230 falling to the medium-pace of Mulder and the left-arm spin of Shamsi. South Africa will travel to Dambulla to play Sri Lanka in a five-match ODI series starting on Sunday.
Scores:
South Africa 293 in 49.4 overs (F du Plessis 71, D Miller 40, R Hendricks 59, W Mulder 56, Asitha Fernando 2/48, Prabath Jayasuriya 2/46, Nishan Peiris 2/47)

Railway unions launch twohour strike
Commuters were left in the lurch yesterday when the railway unions staged an unannounced twohour strike targeting the office rush, over demands that construction work on land allocated to the Railway Department was obstructed by the Urban Development Authority.
The Cabinet of Ministers approved a proposal to allocate land in Maradana for the construction of the Colombo Train Controlling Centre and railway operations headquarters. However when officials had gone to the site today to survey the land, a politician had obstructed their work, said Operating Superintendent of Railways, Colombo Division, V.S Polwattage. This strike action we are told is in response to the incident which had taken place today.
It was announced on Wednesday that the Cabinet of Ministers had approved a proposal by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation to allocate a one acre land and two roads in Tripoli, Maradana for the construction of the Colombo Train Control Centre and Railway Operations Headquarters under the Colombo Suburban Railway Efficieny Improvement Project funded by the Asian Development Bank.

## Title: REFLECTIONS ON LANGUAGES AND COMMUNICATION
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, July 27, 2018 - 01:00
REFLECTIONS ON LANGUAGES AND COMMUNICATION
Dr. W. A. Abeysinghe is a prolific writer. He has over two hundred and fifty titles to his credit. As a journalist, cultural critic, poet, lyricist and social commentator, he has made a profound impression on the thought and imagination of his time. He has clearly being influenced by Marxism throughout his carrier, but has always combined this interest with cultural specificities that are unique to our society. He is a writer who believes in the importance of lucid communication. He always writes clearly and lucidly and is constantly aware of the dangers of miscommunication. Hence I thought it would be appropriate, as we honour Dr. Abeysinghe's contribution to the world of Sinhala arts and letters, to reflect on the idea of miscommunication in language. Dr. Abeysinghe and I have been deeply interested in language and communication studies.
Therefore, I thought it would be productive to examine how modern scholars of communication have conceptualized communication and mis-communication. For this purpose I sought to focus attention on some of the more dominant models developed by communication theorists. Commenting on the use of models in the social sciences, Karl Deutsch identified the following three functions performed by them. First, they perform an organising function in that the serve to order and relate systems to one another and convey to us an idea of the system as a whole which we may otherwise lose sight of. To phrase it differently, a model affords us the opportunity to observe how a given system is organised.
Western culture
Second, models perform an explanatory function; they demonstrate in a somewhat simplified manner how a system operates. What we need to discern here is the way the emphasis is placed on the nature of the process. Third, models perform a predictive function in that they enable us to predict the outcome of events and actions. This has the distinct advantage of allowing us to the opportunity to formulate hypotheses for the purposes of research. We can divide, broadly speaking, models employed in social research into two groups; the structural and processual. The first describes structure and the second focuses on the process. When we explore the evolution of communication model-building, we can identify three main stages. In the first phase, the emphasis was recognizably on linear, one-way communication and the operative term was manipulation. One of the first models of communication that we come across in the Western culture is perhaps that of Aristotle in his rhetoric.
There he calls attention across in the Western culture is perhaps that of Aristotle in his rhetoric. There he calls attention to three important elements of communication  the sender, the message and the receiver. The objective of communication, according to him, is to persuade the receiver of the message in a way deemed fit by the speaker. This tenor of thinking has survived into modern times. It needs to be pointed out that many of the early models of communication beat the imprint of the Aristotle's model. Some modern communication scholars like Beltran have gone so far as to characterize them as Aristotelian models.
There are a number of dominant models associated with the first phase. The models proposed by Harold Lasswell, Shannon and Weaver and David Berlo are among them. Let us consider a representative example  Shannon and Weaver's model. It is also referred to as the mathematical model of communication.
This model was developed in relation to electronic communication. Later it was applied to human communication in general. It focuses on an information source producing a message. This message is transformed into signals by the transmitter, and the signals have to be adapted to the channel. The receiver reconstructs the message on the basis of the signals and forwards it to the destination. The signal is susceptible to the interference by the channel and hence the importance of paying close attention to the noise. Here I am using the technical terms used by Shannon and Weaver.
Mechanical transfer of information
The communication models developed in the second phase sought to eliminate some of the deficiencies apparent in the early models such as being linear and one way and a heavy emphasis on the communicator. Some of the models associated with the second phase are those of Schramm, Gerbner, Riley and Riley and Osgood. Let us consider the Schramm model as an example. It can be described as a circular model where the stress is on the channels that connect the communicator and receiver as opposed to the emphasis on the communicator in the models associated with the first phase. It is evident that the emphasis of the models developed in the second phase is on the organic nature of communication as opposed to the mechanical transfer of information.
The attempt at communication model-building reflective of the third phase points to the desire to further redefine the already existing models and the conceptualizations that led to their production. Fields of inquiry such as systems theory, cybernetics, semiotics and structuralism have yielded rich insights into the relationship between man and society; these have inspired modern communication theorists. It is indeed challenging to identify any one single model as being representative of the third phase, although the continuing efforts of many scholars deserve careful consideration.
It is evident that the communication models developed so far represent an attempt to refine what preceded them. However, one fact is evident. In none of these models in miscommunication regarded as endemic to the communication process. For example, the communication model propelled by the eminent social philosopher is based in the belief that communication, ideally, should lead to consensus and problems of miscommunication are given short shrift in these models. It is after the rise of postmodernism and deconstruction and their influence on communication theory since the 1970s that miscommunication began to receive some attention.
Dr. Abeysinghe, it seems to me, was firmly convinced of the fact that miscommunication was at the heart of the communication process. He was of the belief that the idea of noise was not something external to the communication process as many communication theorists believed but that it was at the heart of it. Hence it is important to discover the true meaning of this phenomenon and how best to theorize it.
While it is true that there have been some ideas that scholars such as Jacques Derrida have produced which could be profitably pursued in this regard, we must be wary of the unyielding linguistic determinism proposed by them.

The right move
The decision taken by the Education Ministry to get tough with University lecturers who fail to return to the country at the end of their post graduate studies overseas is a move in the right direction. A front page story we carried in yesterday's issue of the Daily News quotes the Higher Education and Cultural Ministry Secretary J. J. Rathnasiri as saying that at a Vice Chancellors' meeting it was decided to prosecute University lecturers who play truant in this manner. The Secretary said they will also prosecute the sureties of the bond that the University lecturers entered into with the UGC in the event these lecturers fail to return following their overseas stints, if their whereabouts abroad could not be traced.
Overseas lecturers agree to serve four years in the country following their government funded overseas post-graduate degrees. The Secretary said such a measure was required since an enormous amount of public funds are spent on these scholars for their overseas studies. ''Not only that, the government spends lakhs of rupees in public funds for their education until they complete their degree''. He also made the disclosure that they (the lecturers) continued to be paid while they pursue their studies overseas. It was also decided at the VCs' meeting that the University lecturers who go abroad for further studies should return, or, pay the full amounts that were spent on them.
We often hear of athletes in poor countries who go abroad to participate in the Olympics, or, similar international sporting events, decamping in the host country, particularly if the country happens to be an affluent one, to the great embarrassment of the country that sent them. This, more often than not, is a desperate bid to escape the poverty prevalent in the home country and also in search of employment.
These academics who fail to return to the country after completing their studies abroad too could be placed in this category of persons who bring shame to their motherland. Like the athletes mentioned, these men and women too are sponsored by the government and all their expenses borne by the state, over a long period. Also like the rogue athletes, these men and women of learning too receive their training at tremendous cost to the government and are even recipients of expensive scholarship bursaries.
Besides, decamping in this fashion after being maintained by the state is nothing short of a traitorous act. Nay, it is tantamount to a criminal act and steps should be taken by the authorities to issue an Interpol arrest warrant on those who cheat the state by the millions in the same manner an Interpol warrant has been issued on the former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran who had allegedly caused losses to the state running into billions.
The move is all the more necessary given the brain drain that is often being spoken about in all quarters. Only recently did the President strike a serious note on this phenomenon and pleaded with the country's academics and professionals not to take their talents elsewhere, or, at least, serve for a specific period in the country of their birth. He also called on the professionals already domiciled in the affluent West to return to the motherland and give of their expertise that they, no doubt, acquired in this country.
By turning their backs on their country after being nurtured by it all their adult life these University lecturers are also setting a bad precedent, in that those next in line for the overseas scholarships would follow in the footsteps of their predecessors and decide to stay put in the host country. Not only that, they are also likely to sponsor their fellow academics and batch-mates to join them in their adopted countries to secure well paid jobs. The problem could only exacerbate given the various study courses currently being offered to youth who have attained a certain level of educational qualifications to live and work in countries such as Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Very soon the country will be bereft of all the educated and qualified men and women necessitating the import of talent, at tremendous cost. Besides, with the Universities in turmoil, the production line of educated professionals, no doubt, would be slowed down considerably, adding to the problem.
Be that as it may, the government too should create a conducive environment to prevent our professionals leaving the country seeking greener pastures. Prime attention should be paid to their welfare and incentives made available to retain them in the country. It was only two years ago that the salaries of the University lecturers were adjusted to be commensurate with their qualifications and academic attainments. It is not known how many of them left the country before that due to this anomaly. Similarly, the proper milieu should be created for the return of our professionals, from abroad. No one would want to come to a country that is politically unstable and where uncertainty is a common feature. What is important is to create the necessary confidence that would lure our professionals back to the country.

Salah, Mane on  target as Liverpool down City
East Rutherford, Thursday: Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane made an instant impact as Liverpool came from behind to beat Premier League champions Manchester City 2-1 in their International Champions Cup friendly match on Wednesday.
Mane stroked home Liverpools winner from the penalty spot deep into stoppage time to give Jurgen Klopps men a morale-boosting victory over an under-strength City team at the MetLife Stadium.
Klopp praised Manes performance after coming on in the second half.
The second half pleased me, first half not so much, Klopp said.
You saw the difference when Sadio came on. He played balls in behind and made life difficult.
With this and all the other changes, it changed the game.
Both Klopp and City boss Pep Guardiola were unimpressed with the makeshift playing surface in a venue used by the New York Giants and New York Jets NFL teams.
Better to throw the ball than pass it in this arena, Klopp said.
Guardiola meanwhile said he was relieved no players were injured.
This happened in my first season with Barcelona and I was so angry, so upset, Guardiola said when asked about the pitch.
I grew up and am a more mature guy. I look to the other side. It is business. We pray before the game that there would be no injuries and thats what happened.
Both Liverpool and Citys pre-season preparations in the United States have been disrupted by the absence of several key players who starred in the World Cup.
Guardiola however sounded a positive note about the absentees.
I learned that when I was little boy in Barcelona in the Academy. Dont find excuses, he said.
We are happy as a club to have 16 players out and the most with their national teams, thats a good sign for the club.
In the past it didnt happen, years ago, and that is good for our future. But we are going to adapt. Its as simple as that.
Salah and Mane both reported for duty for Liverpool in time for Wednesdays game.
Nonetheless, it was City who took the lead just after half-time when German international Leroy Sane caught Liverpools defence napping and burst clear to slot past Caoimhin Kelleher on 57 minutes.
Egypt star Salah, however, was quick to make his mark after coming on for Curtis Jones in the 62nd minute, scoring a header with virtually his first touch of the game to level it at 1-1.
The game appeared to be heading for a draw until Tosin Adarabioyo crashed into Dominic Solanke in the area for a certain penalty.
Mane stepped up to send Joe Hart the wrong way and give Klopps team the win. AFP

Scriptural spirituality
Dawn breaks in Thailand. A wave of orange sweeps over the entire country as monks from all over leave their monasteries and depart for their daily alms round. This scene has attracted more and more Westerners towards a closer glimpse of the lifestyle of a Thai Buddhist monk. Spending time in a monastery during your visit to Thailand can allow such an experience, and in fact is one of the greatest times one has in the country. Walking into any monastery for the first time means leaving your old world behind in exchange for new, far different one. No cell phone... No laptop... No iPod. This is a good thing.
That experience is embedded in one of the two books published by the renowned scholar, Chamika Munasinghe titled Sithe Vismitha Haskam (authored by Tilaka Kudahetti).
The other book titled Soma Himi Nam Divya Puthraya is authored by Chamika Munasinghe. Kudahettis book deals with several meditative experiences of the Thai Buddhist monks living in the forest. Have you ever wondered about the hidden and mysterious lives of monks What do they do during the day How do they live their lives What activities and rituals do they perform in their daily routines Now is your chance to not only take a peek into the hidden lives of monks, but also to participate and build merit as they do.
Munasinghes book is centred on the late Venerable Gangodawila Soma Theras life and his legacy. Venerable Gangodawila Soma Thera was born in Gangodawila, a semi-urban locality in the outskirts of the capital city of Colombo.
Soma Thera was ordained as novice in 1974 when he was 26 years of age under the tutelage of two of the most revered monks in Sri Lanka  Most Reverend Venerable Madihe Pannasiha Maha Nayake Thera and Venerable Ampitiye Rahula Maha Thera. He received training at the Bhikkhu Training Centre, Maharagama  an institution established by the monks mentioned above.
Having obtained his higher ordination in 1976, Some Thera continued to study the Buddhist texts in Pali, their original language, according to Theravada tradition. He was particularly interested in doing research into the teachings of the Buddha and have written several books on the subject.
He saw his mission to mould the younger generation to live according to the Dhamma. He rallied round him a youth organisation called Tharunu Saviya ("Strength of the Youth").
A keen student of meditation, he took time off to be in solitude in distant, lonely locations. His interest in meditating on the qualities of the Buddha made him work on an exhaustive study on the subject. His published work Buddhastupa is a useful guide to those interested in such meditation. Soma Thera's links with Victoria (Australia) dates back to 1986, when he was invited by some Sri Lankans to spend time preaching the Dhamma. After six months he returned to Sri Lanka. When he came back in 1989, the groundwork had been done to set up the Buddhist Vihara Victoria. The two books are available at Sahitha Poth Piyasa premises, 717/1 (near Ananda College) on May 27 at 10 am. The copies will be available with the authors signature.

Shops demolished for lack of planning
A group of people in Anuradhapura have expressed their displeasure at the demolition of 16 shops at a pola, even before they were opened.
They said that the shops were constructed at a cost of Rs.20 million and have even been provided with electricity. These buildings have been demolished under the directions of the Anuradhapura Mayor H.P. Somadasa.
Anuradhapura JVP Urban Councilor Asela Wijesinghe said that these buildings were constructed during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime. But they were demolished under the instructions of the mayor who is from the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna, since they had not been constructed with a suitable plan.
This is peoples money, Wijesinghe said. Recently many such buildings were demolished. Mayor Somadasa said in a telephone interview that these buildings were constructed with funds directed by then minister Basil Rajapaksa. He said that MP Semasinghe constructed these buildings for publicity. Later it was pointed out that they were not suitable for selling fish, the Mayor said. So they are being demolished.

Sooriyabandara scores fighting century but Lanka follow-on
Royal College cricketer Pasindu Sooriyabandara stroked a fine century but Sri Lanka was forced to follow-on in the second U19 four-day test against India played at Mahinda Rajapaksa Stadium, Hambantota yesterday.
Facing a huge Indian total of 613-8 declared, Sri Lanka replied with 316 with Sooriyabandara hitting 17 fours in his 236-balls knock of 115.
With Sonal Dinusha who scored a half century off 144 balls (8 fours), Sooriyabandara added 128 for the fifth wicket, but apart from their stand only Sandun Mendis made any sort of worthwhile contribution with 49 off 109 balls (8 fours).
Left-arm medium-pacer Mohit Jangra claimed the lions share with four wickets. Forced to follow-on Sri Lanka slumped to 47-3 by the close of the third day, still trailing by 250 runs with seven wickets in hand to avoid back to back innings defeats. Today is the final day.

Suicide  attack  on Afghan  intelligence  convoy kills five
AFGHANISTAN: A suicide bomber blew himself up near an Afghan intelligence convoy on Thursday, killing at least five people and wounding six, police said, in the latest deadly attack in the city.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack on the National Directorate of Security (NDS), which police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said happened at 5:00 am. Most of the victims were NDS officers, Stanikzai said.
Four members of the NDS and a civilian were killed, while five NDS personnel and a civilian were wounded.
The attacker was most likely driving a vehicle carrying explosives, Stanikzai added.
The assault comes two days after five rockets were fired on a residential area of Kabul, wounding at least three people. There was no claim of responsibility.
And on Sunday, a suicide bomber blew himself up near Kabul international airport, killing at least 23 people, including AFP driver Mohammad Akhtar. A further 107 people were wounded.
That attack was claimed by the Islamic State group (IS), which said it had targeted Afghan Vice President Abdul Rashid Dostum, who returned to Kabul after more than a year in exile.
Taliban and IS militants have repeatedly carried out deadly attacks in the Afghan capital, turning it into one of the most dangerous places in the country. - AFP

Thundenek from ONUR  on impact of war
The latest Sinhala language movie Thundenek or Her. Him. The Other produced by the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation and directed by Asoka Handagama, PrasannaVithanage and Vimukthi Jayasundara, will be screened in cinemas islandwide soon.
A special show and a discussion of the movie for government officers, Security Forces and police officers was held this week at the National Film Cooperation.
Thundenek is a feature film by the three renowned directors where the characters reflect on the social impact of the three-decade war in Sri Lanka. The discussion following the special screening was attended by Handagama and Vithanage.
Handagama said, For many years we were planning to do a film not on the war, but on the impact of the war. There are still unresolved issues and we wanted to make a movie that would prompt a dialogue on such issues. He said that the premiere had received positive feedback with requests from both Sinhala and Tamil communities to show the movie to their communities. Some had offered to organise public screenings which received great interest with engaging post-screening discussions.
Our film is about the aftermath of the war, Vithange said. The war created many stories - stories without closure. All three stories in Thundenek are about people who are looking for closure. He said that the Sri Lankan people could easily relate to the polarisation of communities and thus the title Her. Him. The Other. For the Sinhala people, Tamils have become the other and vice versa. The same goes for Muslims.
Vithanage said that no matter the audience, if the emotions conveyed were truthful, it would be well received. All the Tamil-speaking actors for Vithanages film were from Jaffna. His team conducted a two-day workshop for 25 aspiring filmmakers.
The movie has already been invited to and highlighted at international film festivals and the public release in cinemas will take place soon.

## Title: Two Faces of the Dhamma
## Supertitle:

Two Faces of the Dhamma
On first encounter Buddhism confronts us as a paradox. Intellectually, it appears a freethinker's delight: sober, realistic, undogmatic, almost scientific in its outlook and method. But if we come into contact with the living Dhamma from within, we soon discover that it has another side which seems the antithesis of all our rationalistic presuppositions. We still don't meet rigid creeds or random speculation, but we do come upon religious ideals of renunciation, contemplation and devotion; a body of doctrines dealing with matters transcending sense perception and thought; and  perhaps most disconcerting  a programme of training in which faith figures as a cardinal virtue, doubt as a hindrance, barrier and fetter.
When we try to determine our own relationship with the Dhamma, eventually we find ourselves challenged to make sense out of its two seemingly irreconcilable faces: the empiricist face turned to the world, telling us to investigate and verify things for ourselves, and the religious face turned to the Beyond, advising us to dispel our doubts and place trust in the Teacher and his Teaching.
Dhamma's empiricism
One way we can resolve this dilemma is by accepting only one face of the Dhamma as authentic and rejecting the other as spurious or superfluous. Thus, with traditional Buddhist pietism, we can embrace the religious side of faith and devotion, but shy off from the hard-headed world-view and the task of critical inquiry; or, with modern Buddhist apologetics, we can extol the Dhamma's empiricism and resemblance to science, but stumble embarrassingly over the religious side.
Yet reflection on what a genuine Buddhist spirituality truly requires, makes it clear that both faces of the Dhamma are equally authentic and that both must be taken into account. If we fail to do so, not only do we risk adopting a lopsided view of the teaching, but our own involvement with the Dhamma is likely to be hampered by partiality and conflicting attitudes.
The problem remains, however, of bringing together the two faces of the Dhamma without sidling into self-contradiction.
The key, we suggest, to achieving this reconciliation, and thus to securing the internal consistency of our own perspective and practice, lies in considering two fundamental points: first, the guiding purpose of the Dhamma; and second, the strategy it employs to achieve that purpose. The purpose is the attainment of deliverance from suffering.
Path to spiritual emancipation
The Dhamma does not aim at providing us with factual information about the world, and thus, despite a compatibility with science, its goals and concerns are necessarily different from those of the latter. Primarily and essentially, the Dhamma is a path to spiritual emancipation, to liberation from the round of repeated birth, death and suffering. Offered to us as the irreplaceable means of deliverance, the Dhamma does not seek mere intellectual assent, but commands a response that is bound to be fully religious. It addresses us at the bedrock of our being, and there it awakens the faith, devotion and commitment appropriate when the final goal of our existence is at stake.
But for Buddhism faith and devotion are only spurs which impel us to enter and persevere along the path; by themselves they cannot ensure deliverance. The primary cause of bondage and suffering, the Buddha teaches, is ignorance regarding the true nature of existence; hence in the Buddhist strategy of liberation the primary instrument must be wisdom, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.
Investigation and critical inquiry, cool and uncommitted, constitute the first step toward wisdom, enabling us to resolve our doubts and gain a conceptual grasp of the truths upon which our deliverance depends. But doubt and questioning cannot continue indefinitely. Once we have decided that the Dhamma is to be our vehicle to spiritual freedom, we have to step on board: we must leave our hesitancy behind and enter the course of training which will lead us from faith to liberating vision.
For those who approach the Dhamma in quest of intellectual or emotional gratification, inevitably it will show two faces, and one will always remain a puzzle. But if we are prepared to approach the Dhamma on its own terms, as the way to release from suffering, there will not be two faces at all. Instead we will see what was there from the start: the single face of Dhamma which, like any other face, presents two complementary sides.

Confusion over dates in court order:
Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera deplaned
Ven. Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera, who was onboard a flight to leave for the UK, was requested to disembark by the Immigration and Emigration Department officials at the Bandaranaike International Airport minutes before the flight took off yesterday.
The Departments Information Officer and Deputy Commissioner M. L. D. Niroshana said there was an issue regarding the date on the court order temporarily lifting the foreign travel ban on the Ven. Thera.
Ven Dhammaloka Thera had obtained permission to go abroad from the Colombo Magistrates Court on Wednesday, but we were not in possession of the said court order when the monk arrived at the BIA.
We communicated this to the court and at the same time allowed the Ven. Thera to proceed.
When we received the court order, we saw the temporary travel ban lift mentioned in the court order was effective only from August 26 to October 12. This could be a typo as well, but we had to offload the Thera and ask him to get the dates corrected, he explained.
Ven. Dhammaloka Thera has been charged with keeping an elephant calf without a permit at the Alan Mathiniyaramaya Temple in Colombo. He was arrested in 2016 and was granted conditional bail which includes a foreign travel ban.
The Ven. Thera who had to exit the BIA due to the confusion over the court order said he was to leave for the UK to attend a Pinkama at the Sri Saddhatissa International Buddhist Centre (Kingsbury Vihara) in London and another pinkama in Wales.

Ven.Fa Hsien Thera: the icon of Buddhism in China
Ven Fa Hsien Thera is a Chinese Buddhist Monk who engaged in a quest to bring the Sacred Buddhist Texts from the then South Asian sites of Buddhism and translate them to propagate the Buddha Dhamma in China.
His endeavour that started in 399 CE was to last more than 12 years before he could return to China. Ven Fa Hsien Thero is regarded as a crucial historical link between China and other Asian Buddhist countries such as Sri Lanka, wherein the present day the Belt and Road Initiative has evoked the significance of the ancient land and maritime Silk Roads he travelled.
Born in 337 CE in Shanxi, Ven. Fa Hsien lived under the influence of Buddhism which enjoyed imperial favour during the Eastern Jin Dynasty and adopted his spiritual name which translates as the Splendour of Dhamma. His travelogue  Foguoji (Record of Buddhist Kingdoms) gives vivid details of his travels from China to India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and then to Sri Lanka which was then one of the most flourishing centres of Buddhism learning at the time. What is incredible is that his travel on land was mostly on foot despite the dangers ever-present and obvious. On an account of his terrifying crossing of the wastelands of Central Asia, he writes:
In the desert were numerous evil spirits and scorching winds, causing death to anyone who would meet them. Above there were no birds, while on the ground there were no animals. One looked as far as one could in all directions for a path to cross, but there was none to choose. Only the dried bones of the dead served as indications.
Upon his arrival in North-Western India in 402 CE, he settled into studying the Sanskrit scripts with Buddhist scholars and engaging in conversations with learned monks. He transcribed the Vinaya of Mahesanghika School and acquired another version of Vinaya from Sarvastivada School and the famous Mahaparinirvana-Sutra. He visited the most important sites of Buddhist learning  Udyana, Gandhara, Peshawar and Taxila, and the Buddhist Holy Sites  Lumbini, the Birthplace of Prince Siddhartha, Bodh Gaya where Enlightenment was attained, Baranas, the site of the first Sermon and Kushinagar where the Exalted One attained Supreme bliss of Parinirvana.
On his return trip to China, Ven. Fa Hsien Thero took a different route from the one he adopted for his arrival and sailed to Sri Lanka where he added the Mahishasaka Vinaya and a selection of the Sarvastivada canon to his collection of Buddhist scripts. After 02 years in Sri Lanka, he set sail for China where he spent the rest of his life translating and editing the scriptures, rendering a yeoman service to Buddhism in China till his passing away in around 422 CE.

Visual tribute to faith
Kandys biggest pageant, the Sri Dalada Esala Perahera continues for 10 days ending with the Daval (Day) Perahera. There are five Kumbal and five Randoli Peraheras. People take their young children to view the first Kumbal Perahera believing it to bring them good health.
The origins of the Dalada Perahera date back to the time of king Kirthi Sri Meghavanna who received he sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha, brought from India by Princess Hemamala and Prince Danta, during his reign in Anuradhapura. The king Commanded that the relic be taken around the city once a year with pomp and pageantry. It is this tradition that is continued, though it may have been interrupted due to wars and invasions.
During king Kirti Sri Rajasinha's rule in Kandy, the Dalada Perahera joined with the four Devala Perahera of the Natha, Vishnu, Kataragama and Pattini on a request made to the king by Maha Thera Upali from who came to revive upasampada.
The foremost ceremony of the Esala Perahera in the Kap situweema in the Premises of the for Devalas. The Vishnu Devalaya also known as the Maha Devalaya plays a major role by having the responsibility of distributing the Kap to the other three devals Kapa is a stump cut from a tree which has a milky Sap. It also means a dedication to the goods a vow and wish to make the Perahera a success. The Kapa is brought from Aluthnuwara, situated close to Mawanella on the Kandy  Colombo road.
All rituals and activities are performed at auspicious time according to the Sinhala Almanac. The Maha Vishnu Devale Kapumahattaya K.M. Varuna Bandara explained that on performed at an auspicious hour by the Wanhaku Rala (who is in charge of all activities in the Devale) lighting nine pahan oil lamps placing nine varieties of flowers and reciting Astaka he cut the Kapa. (a branch) from a sapling of a Jak Tree whilst five bhikkhus chanted Pirith (religious stanzas). It was washed with saffron water and taken to the Aluthnuwara Dedmunda Devalaya to be blessed by the Kapumahattaya.
Varuna Bandara who has Rajakariya duty to perform rites at the Maha Vishnu Devale said that this year the Kapa was Wedama Kara (brought) from Aluthnuwra on August 02 on a tusker. In the recent past, the Kapa was brought in a vehicle upto Raja Veediya from where it as taken in a Parahera to the Maha Vishnu Devalaya in Kandy. How ever, this year following anage old custom the Kapa was brought in a perahera all the way form Aluthnuwara, a distance of about 25km on a tusker accompanied be hevisi (drummers) and flag bearers. The elephant, the drummers and flag bearers were changed every five kilometres considering the distance they had to walk from Aluthnuwara to Kandy.
The Kapa which was brought to the Maha Vishnu Devalaya, was cut in to four pieces of about one and a half feet in length, wrapped in cloth and distributed to the four Devales to be planted in the Esala Ge in the Devala premises.
On the Randoli perahera which becomes longer with the addition of elephants dancers and drummers, Progresses to a magnificent spectacle. The Diyawadana Nilame walks behind the Maligawa Tusker Carrying the Perahera Karanduwa (Golden Casket) followed by the Kandyan Chief (Nilames) in their full regalia who walks in their respective Devala Peraheras. On the first day of the Randoli Perahera on Aug. members of the Adivasi Community men and women will come to the Dalada Maligawa bringing the Mee Wada (honey combs) Packed in layers in Labuketa (Dried guards) to offer meepani puja and pay their respect to the sacred Tooth Relic.
This Buddha Pujawa was revived during the time of Uruwarige Tissa Hami Aththo, the then leader of the Adhivasi community. After Buddha attained supreme Enlightenment it is mentioned that two merchants. Thapassu and Bahalluka with t00 carts carrying goods had travelled through the Kiripalu forest when their carts stalled in the mud. They were informed by the Devas the Buddha was seated under a Kiripalu tree without food. The merchants Prepared a delicious meal with honey and offered in tot eh Buddha. This is believed to be the fist instance of honey being offered to the Buddha.
It is also mentioned that when Buddha was in the Paraleiya forest, an elephant and a monkey had offered honey to Buddha on the last night of the Randoli Perahera (07) the Maligawa Suker Carries the Perahera karanduwa to the Asgiriya Gedige Viharaya where it is kept overnight. A section of the four devala Perahera proceed to the Getambe Thota for the water cutting ceremony at dawn in the Mahaweli river and returning to Kandy, leave the palanquins with the containers of water in the Pillayar Kovil in Katukelle.
The following day the four Devala Peraheras leave the Pillayar Kovil at about 2.30 in the afternoon and join with the Maligawa Perahera which leaves the Asgiriya Gedige Viharaya at the same time, to proceed along D.S. Senanayake Veediya (Trincomalee Street) Raja Veediya and finally end at the Maligawa. The four Devala Peraheras return to their respective Devals.

First Sermon at Deer Park Valley of Isipatana:
When the Wheel of Dhamma was set in Motion
Independent Indias First Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru says in his famous book The Discovery of India, Some of his recorded words would come like a distant echo through two thousand five hundred years ago.-- That is how he comprehended the Buddha preaching his first sermon at Saranath near Baranasi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana.
An eventful month of July 2018, ends with Esala Poya; A strong sense of uncertainty that loomed large over Sri Lanka is fading away
Prince Siddhartha, son of King Suddhodana and Queen Maha Maya lived in three deluxe palaces provided by his father. He was not pleased with these pleasures, and at 29, on realising that he would fall ill become aged and that one day he will breathe his last. An urge to discover the truth emerged he finally takes a decision. It was exactly, 2614 years ago, Siduhath abandoned the worldly possessions to become an ascetic. He undertook this Great Renunciation on Esala Poya day in search of truth.
If a person foolishly does me wrong, I will return to him the protection of my boundless love. The more evil that comes from him the more good will go from me. I will always give off only the fragrance of goodness. - The Buddha
Significance of Esala
The other significant events associated with Esala Fullmoon include:
Renunciation by Siduhath; The conception of the Bodhisatta in Queen Mayas womb; The performance of the Twin Miracles (yamaka-patihariya); Preaching Abhidhamma in the Tavatimsa heaven for Maathru-divya [mother] and foundation laying for Ruwanweli dagoba in Anuradhapura. The Inauguration of the Siam Maha Nikaya.
Inauguration of the Siam Nikaya
In 1753, exactly 265 years ago, on Esala Poya, the great restoration or Theravada Buddhist Reformation of the Maha Sangha took place at Malwatte Temple (Pushparama Maha Vihare), in Kandy. The Most Venerable Upali Maha Thera, on receiving an invitation from King Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe, along with his junior pupil came to Kandy from Siam, (now Thailand) and administered Higher Ordination (Upasampada) in a Seemamalaka built at the lake for the purpose. Ecclesiastical title of Sangharaja was conferred on Ven. Welivita Saranankara Thera by the Royal Court who initiated this grand occurrence. The Shyampoli (Siyam) Maha Nikaya was born on July 17, 1753, at this historic occasion.
Dhammachakka Pavattana Sutta
Dhammachakka Pavattana Sutta was preached to the five ascetics, Kondanna, Bhaddiya, Vappa, Mahanama and Assaji, at the deer park, at Isipatanaramaya in Baranesa. The Sangha Sasana that established on this day spread over South-East Asia during King Dharmasoka.
There are these two outermost that are not to be reveled in by one who has gone forth. Which two That which is attached to sensual pleasure with reference to sensual objects: base, ignoble, vulgar, common, unprofitable; and that which is devoted to self-affliction: painful, ignoble, unprofitable. Avoiding both of these extreme ends, the middle way realized by the Buddha  producing vision, producing knowledge  leads to calm, to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to Unbinding. - The Buddha
Dhamma and politics
Politics is Greed and Power, whereas Dhamma is Morality and Purity. Cosmic Law of Cause and Effect or Karma is the law of moral causation. Those who make an effort to combine or interact Dhamma with politics, an inborn problem with some politicians, should appreciate that the basis of Dhamma is ethics, purity and morality, while that of politics is greed for power. There is sufficient evidence in world political history, where religion has as a practice been used or misused to justify exercise of authority by those in possession of it, particularly for waging wars, atrocities, rebellions, destruction of culture and demolition of religious places of worship. Religion had been employed to pander to political needs; worldly political anxieties have superseded religions morals and just principles.
There is a limit to what a political system can safeguard the happiness and prosperity of its people. Though it appears to be complete with perfect policies and principles and an ideal system, they cannot bring about contentment and harmony as long as the people are subject to hatred, greed and illusion. Promises on basic human rights and checks and balances to the use of power are characters of a good and just political system. Creation of new political establishments has nothing to do with Buddha Dhamma; Political institutions have a sacred duty in improving equitable sharing of resources, welfare of the society, and guiding the people towards superior humanism.
Politics in temples
Only in the minds which are conflict free, one can find total freedom; it cannot be established in any political structure like democracy, communism or socialism. To be free, we have to look within our own minds and work towards freeing ourselves from the chains of unawareness, ignorance and craving. The Buddha, never chose to influence political power to introduce his dhamma, although the Blessed One closely associated with kings, ministers and princes; nor did he allow the teachings to be misused or abused for gaining benefit for aspiring political power. Many politicians of competing factions today, are dragging the Buddha and his Dhamma into politics by quoting and mis-interpreting the Sutras. Quite a few temples have become central propaganda offices of political interests. Recognised political organisations persuade Sangha units within party machinery while a few saffron robed extremists elements have formed political units to assist politicians contest elections.
Let us live happily, not hating those who hate us. Among those who hate us, let us live free from hatred. Let us live happily and free from ailment. Let us live happily and be free from greed; among those who are greedy. -- Dhammapada- stanza -197-
People today are restless, fear and unhappiness reign. They are intoxicated with craving to gain power, wealth and fame. They are forever under doubt and insecurity. Peaceful coexistence among fellow countrymen have become an extremely difficult task in this time of confusion and disorder and crisis.
Buddhist view on tolerance
The expression tolerance here includes open-mindedness in sympathetic understanding of other religions without prejudices, judgement, or bias. The open-minded person will have more liberty in his mind for other races, religions and cultures: on the contrary, for a narrow minded person, it is impossible to respect any other religions and cultures. According to Dhamma, attachment to views, beliefs and opinions are defilements that causes narrow mindedness. The Buddha never taught his disciples to get attached to his teachings with blind faith. He persuaded those who believe in a faith not to attach with blind faith, but with wisdom. (Kalama sutta)
Monks, if anyone should speak in blame of me, of the Teaching or of the Order, you should not be angry, resentful or upset on that account. If you were to be angry or displeased at such blame, that would only be a hindrance to you. For if others blame me, the Teaching or the Order, and you are angry or displeased, can you recognize whether what they say is right or wrong....
Monks, if anyone should speak in praise of me, of the Teaching or of the Order, you should not on that account be pleased, happy or elated. If you were to be pleased, happy or elated at such praise, that would only be a hindrance to you. If others praise me, the Teaching or the Order, and you are, you should acknowledge the truth of what is true Monks, if anyone should speak in blame of me, of the Teaching . you should acknowledge the truth of what is true-- The Buddha
May all beings be happy!

Writ petition against Maharagama UC election fixed for Aug. 1
A writ petition seeking a declaration that the election of 23 candidates who contested to the Maharagama Urban Council under an Independent Group (motorcycle symbol) is invalid and that they are disqualified from sitting and voting, was yesterday fixed for support for August 1 by the Court of Appeal.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal President Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara, the court was informed that several respondents who were listed in the petition have already resigned from their positions.
Chandrasena Perera, a registered voter for the electoral area of the Maharagama Urban Council, has filed this petition naming 27 persons, including 23 members of the Independent Group, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and members of the Election Commission as respondents.
The petitioner stated that the elections of the members of the Independent Group No 2 are void since they did not have the qualification required by Section 8 of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance.
The petitioner alleged that most candidates, who contested under the motorcycle symbol, were not residents of Maharagama. The petitioner said the addresses listed next to their names read as Divulapitiya, Badalgama and Wellawatta.
The petitioner also sought an Interim Order directing the Election Commission to produce the official nomination paper, and the respective affidavits and declarations of the candidates of Independent group No.2 who contested the Local Authorities Elections held on February 10.
