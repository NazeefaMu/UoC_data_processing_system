Sri Lanka joins global initiative targetting marine pollution
Sri Lanka has joined an effort by member states across the historic British Commonwealth, in order to reduce plastic waste flowing into the oceans.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Sunday, that Sri Lanka, New Zealand and Ghana, had joined the Commonwealth Clean Oceans Alliance.
The said global initiative is led by the UK and Vanuatu. According to the environmental advocacy group Plastic Oceans, more than eight million tons of plastic is dumped into the ocean each year. In an effort to bring that number down, UK Prime Minister May said that her country would pledge 61.4 million pounds to conservation research as well as initiatives in member countries, to reduce the amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean.
When it comes to our seas and oceans, the challenge is global; hence, the answer must be too, said UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove, in a statement.
Through this ambitious alliance, we will build on the UKs world-leading microbeads ban and 5p plastic bag charge, to harness the full power of the Commonwealth in pushing for global change and safeguarding our marine environment for future generations, he added.
Sri Lanka banned the manufacture and sale of certain types of polythene in September, 2017.
The Clean Oceans Alliance also announced that developing countries could apply for partnership support, to improve domestic waste-management systems and implement other initiatives to prevent marine pollution.

Sri Lanka needs to create over 120,000 new jobs every year - WB report
The World Banks latest edition of South Asia Economic Focus titled Jobless Growth alerted that massive job creation is needed in the South Asian countries in the next decade to catch-up with other countries with similar income levels.
The report released on April 9 states that priority should go to policies that make growth more prone to job creation in South Asia.
Even allowing for a 20-year transition period for the catch-up, the number of new jobs needed every year would be gigantic.
Bangladesh would have to create over 1.6 million jobs every year, Pakistan more than 2 million, and India close to 13 million. Much smaller Sri Lanka would need to create more than 120,000 new jobs every year, the report stated.
Adding that economic growth rates in excess of 10 percent per year would be needed in all South Asian countries, the report observed; These rates are implausibly high, implying that rapid growth alone will not be enough. If South Asian countries are serious about increasing employment rates, more jobs will need to be created for every percentage point of growth.
World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia Martin Rama in an introductory video to the report said, South Asia is again the fastest growing region in the world after a period of slow down mainly driven by India. The region is bouncing back and is now ahead of the other traditionally fast growing East Asia and Pacific.
However, he pointed out that the exports in the region remain very weak despite the recovering of global economy.
The question is whether this kind of growth that the region is having will be enough to create jobs for all these young people who are reaching working age and aspiring to enter the workforce.
The South Asian countries have been creating large numbers of jobs, but concern is what kind of jobs.
We do not see enough people moving out of agriculture into manufacturing and services. We see relatively few jobs with regular wages and we dont see enough women, he explained.
The analysis of the report shows that rapid growth alone will not be sufficient to bring South Asian employment rates to the levels observed elsewhere in the developing world. In addition to high growth, more and better jobs need to be created for every percentage point of growth the report said.
With reference to Sri Lanka, the report stated that the countrys improvement in its macroeconomic performance in 2017 was masked by inclement weather. Expediting reforms to promote competitiveness, governance and continued fiscal consolidation are critical for sustained growth and development. Nevertheless, the challenging political environment has already slowed the pace of the reform agenda and remains the key risk to a favorable medium-term outlook, the report analyzed.
Perhaps more disturbingly, the growth in regular wage employment has been extremely modest across the region. Regular wage jobs are generally seen as better jobs, compared to farming, self-employment or casual work, the report added.
The report also highlighted that the share of public sector employment increased substantially during the period from 2005-2015 in Sri Lanka. In Sri Lanka, public employment is relatively high when compared to Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, it added.

Sri Lankan wins lawsuit against UKs National Health Service
A Sri Lankan refugee who could not speak English, had won a legal battle against the UK's National Health Service (NHS), after her child was brain damaged after hospital staff did not explain the importance of feeding a newborn.
Nilujan Rajatheepan was in good condition when he was delivered by caesarean section at King George Hospital in Goodmayes, Essex, in July, 2009. His parents are Tamil refugees from Sri Lanka and his mother, Sinthiya, was 21 when Nilujan was born and spoke only very few words of English.
When the community midwife visited the family after the birth, Nilujan was pale and lethargic, having not been fed for more than 15 hours.
His hypoglycemic state resulted in brain injuries. Nilujan, now eight, has cerebral palsy with impaired physical and cognitive function.
On Friday in London, Judge McKenna ruled that the Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Foundation Trust was liable.
He ruled the midwives had failed to hire an interpreter, in order to tell her to feed her baby. The eight-year-old is currently in line for a multi-million-pound NHS compensation due to the negligence of the midwives in failing to tackle the language barrier.
Judge McKenna said medics at King George Hospital were responsible for effectively ignoring Sinthiya Rajatheepans concerns about her baby.
Because she only knew a few basic words of English, she was never given proper instructions about how to feed her son.
The mother and baby were discharged home too early and, due to poor feeding, Nilujan suffered irreversible brain damage, the judge added.
Rajatheepan, now 29, and her husband Sivarajah, came to Britain from Sir Lanka as refugees in 2008.
The judge said the young mother was certainly unable to understand anything but the simplest of instructions and only when accompanied by hand gestures.
He added the brain damage her son suffered was caused as a result of poor feeding.
Midwives were adamant that they were accustomed to encountering patients with language difficulties and had properly instructed Rajatheepan how to feed her baby.
But, the judge said, The overwhelming weight of evidence, is that Rajatheepan had little ability with the English language.
He added, However, the unfortunate reality is that Rajatheepan did not, in fact, receive any instructions on how to feed her newborn son properly.
Furthermore, she did not receive any instructions on what to look out for and what to do if feeding was unsuccessful, the judge said, adding that because of the language barrier, she did not and could not reasonably, have been expected to have understood the advice she was given.
Judge McKenna said that she was anxious that Nilujan was crying continuously, but her attempts to draw attention to this matter, had been ignored.
The ward had been busy and Rajatheepan of Lavender Place, Ilford, had a propensity simply to smile at people when she caught their eye, he said; she had, albeit timidly, approached the midwives station in a bid to draw attention to her concerns, but was ignored.
The judge said the midwives had given her false reassurance by repeating the mantra that it was normal for new born babys to cry.
The hospitals midwifery team should have contacted the NHS Language Line for help, or called for an interpreter, he ruled.
The judge added, The reality is that no one ever, in fact, gave Rajatheepan a clear and understandable explanation of the importance of feeding.
Because of the language barrier, she had been unable to communicate her concerns to hospital staff, of which the end result was that Rajatheepan was discharged home too early. Had she been kept in hospital overnight, Nilujan would have escaped injury, Judge McKenna said.
Under the circumstances, I would enter judgment in favour of the claimant, with damages to be assessed, the judge concluded.
Nilujans NHS compensation award has yet to be assessed, but is likely to be a multi-million-pound sum, given the extent of his disabilities.
Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust Midwifery Director Wendy Matthews said, We would like to apologise again to Nilujan and the Rajatheepan family and express our sincere sympathies to them.
We are considering the judgment and the implications of the judges ruling in this case. Although we have made improvements since this incident occurred in 2009, we will take the opportunity to review it closely and see if there are any more lessons about our post-natal care that we can learn, she added.

SriLankan earns highest  annual passenger revenue  in 38-year history
SriLankan Airlines, the countrys national carrier yesterday has earned the highest annual passenger revenue in its 38 year history in the 2017/2018 financial year.
The airline posting positive news after several years of losses had achieved a record un-audited annual passenger revenue of Rs. 126.9 billion (US Dollars 830.7 million) in 2017/18. The revenue comes on the back of recent expansion of the airline to include services to several new destinations such as Gan Islands, Hyderabad and Melbourne and additional frequencies to popular cities in its network, explained the Airline in a statement to the media.
The SriLankan Airlines Group last year had the cargo division record Rs. 14.7 billion in revenue on its own bolstered by the its best performing business unit; SriLankan Ground Services.
The overall Group turnover had exceeded one billion US Dollars; making it the highest revenue generating company amongst all Sri Lankan businesses which publicly report their financials.
This is the first instance of the airline achieving its annual revenue target since Emirates Airlines left as the managing partner 10 years ago, SriLankan Airlines Chief Executive Officer Captain Suren Ratwatte said.
This comes at a turbulent time for the industry when most airlines are facing difficulty in maintaining their yields due to intense competition. SriLankan has just completed a year of significant expansion with minimal erosion on yields and ended the year comfortably exceeding the revenue target.
This achievement shows the capability and commitment of our workforce and demonstrates that the Company is well on track with its restructuring targets.
With a new Chairman and Board of Directors in place, I am certain that the airline will reach greater heights in the near future as we concentrate on curtailing our costs, he added. Last year, the company introduced four brand new fuel efficient narrow-bodied aircraft to its fleet and made significant improvements to on-board service, including offering flat-bed Business Class seats on all wide-bodied aircraft and Wi-Fi services on nearly half of its fleet.
The airline is currently on the verge of implementing the second phase of its restructuring plan, which would see the airline become a profitable and self-sufficient entity within a short period. The restructuring initiatives would see the airline further fine tune its route network and implement a range of cost optimisation initiatives.
It intends to report its audited financial results for FY2017/18, which are required to undergo the review of Auditor General of Sri Lanka, before the end of September 2018, read the statement further.
SriLankan has been a major drain on the Treasury with the company declaring heavy losses for the last six years. In 2016/2017, net losses amounted to over Rs.27 billion and the government declared that they would look to restructure the company with the assistance of local partners, having exhausted all foreign options.

Sam a veteran cricket analyst, strategist and team motivator
I had the good fortune of meeting a highly qualified finance professional with nearly 4 decades of post qualifying experience in both Sri Lanka and abroad quite by chance in a restaurant by the side of Havelock Road. He has been an ardent fan of the local and international cricket scene from 1963 todate. He was none other than Sam Samaranayake, a senior chartered accountant and a corporate trainer in many fields of industry and commerce.
Sam was an old Anandian who entered Ananda in 1959 (Tram cars and Trolley bus days) and left school in 1973. Although he did not play cricket at Ananda, he used to visit the Campbell Place grounds to watch almost all home matches of the Ananda senior team. Those days matches started at 12 noon and had a milk interval from 1.50 p.m. to 2 p.m. and a tea break from 3.45 p.m. to 4 p.m.
Sam has been following Ananda cricket from the time of captain Yatagama Amaradasa and was full of praise for other captains, namely, Sarath Wimalaratne, Duminda Siriwardene, big match winning captain A.G. Perera, Tilak de Silva, Lalith Guneratne, Sunil Wettimuny, Sanjeeva Senanayake, Mithra Wettimuny and his class mate H.D.K. Subash. He has compiled comprehensive data bases on Ananda cricket. Sam was also very happy to watch four of his classmates performing for Ananda senior team, namely, Lalith Ranatunge, H.D.K. Subash, Lakshman (Darrel) Piyasena and Mahesh de Zoysa.
His contribution to Ananda cricket started in August 2005 when former Ananda, Police, SSC and BRC cricketer Udaya Ananda Perera took over as the First Eleven coach of Ananda from Anuruddha Polonowita. Sam knew Udaya well since Udayas brother Maithri was his class mate. Sam visited the college grounds on the first day of practices for 2005/6 season and assessed the strength of the team and informed Udaya accordingly. Udaya promptly requested Sam to make use of his professional talents and vast knowledge 0f cricket to uplift the team morale and to make them a winning outfit. Sam had a close tab on the progress of Ananda cricket and agreed to spend time with the team at practices and matches since Ananda was unable to win the schools limited overs title since 2000.
Sam planned out effective strategies with the coach and team captain and as a result, Ananda became the holders of the limited overs crown on 9 April 2006 by beating the much stronger Peterite side coached by Roger Wijesuriya. Ananda got 190 runs whereas St Peters were bundled out for 140. The Peterites came to the final by beating their arch rivals Joes. Joes had the services of present national players Angelo Mathews, Thisara Perera, Dimuth Karunaratne and Roshen Silva. Peterites were firm favourites to win the title under Hans Fernando. However, Sam, Udaya and skipper Chathura Herath mapped out perfect strategies and talked to the players at a meeting and took away their fear psychosis prior to the match since the players were well aware of the might of the Peterites. The average age of that Ananda team was 16 plus. On Sunday 9 April 2006 the highly motivated Ananda team turned tables on the Peterites to win the Lemonade trophy (schools limited overs title) by registering a very comfortable win by 59 runs. So Ananda became champions again after a lapse of five years. In 2005/6 season Ananda also won the best fielders award in schools for captain Chathura Herath, stated Sam.
Sam was rewarded for his contributions and was appointed as the treasurer of the Old Anandians Cricket Wing in June 2006 to continue his assistance to Ananda Cricket. Sam and coach Udaya combined effectively again to beat Royal College, Colombo in cricket after 47 long years. Ananda recorded an innings victory over Royal in their own den at Reid Avenue on 27 January 2007. The wreckers of the Royalists were skipper Malith Gunathilaka and Udara Pieris spinning a vicious web around them. Prabodha Seneviratne top scored with 90 runs for Ananda. In the 2006/7 season skipper Malith Gunathilaka also won the awards of Schoolboy cricketer, Best Allrounder, Best Bowler and the Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer. Ananda also reached the quarterfinal of the Lemonade trophy and lost to Moratuwa Sebastianites by just 4 runs. This was mainly due to the non-availability of one their opening batsmen and a good pace bowler, noted Sam. With a new coach taking over Ananda cricket for 2007/8, Sam opted to continue his practice and corporate training and has written nearly 50 full pages of business/sports articles in English dailies during the past two years which are of very useful practical knowledge to the corporate executives. He wished to contribute to a book on Golden Memories of Ananda cricket in line with the 90th big match next year together with a select band of past Ananda and Nalanda cricketers. Sam will be an asset to any cricketing organization or any team as I deduced from the few conversations that I had with him.

British PM faces Parliament over Syria attacks
UK: Theresa May is to face MPs' questions about her decision to authorise air strikes against the Syrian government.
Opposition parties say MPs should have been consulted before the UK joined the US and France in bombing three Syrian sites, in response to a suspected chemical attack on the town of Douma.
Labour has called for the law to be changed for any future interventions. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson promised MPs would have "abundant time" to have their say.
Sites near Damascus and Homs were hit on Saturday in response to the alleged chemical attack on Douma on April 7.
Both Syria, which denies any chemical use, and Russia, which provides military support to the Syrian government, have reacted angrily to the action.
UK Prime Ministers do not legally need to consult Parliament before launching military action, although they have done so since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
May was due to give a Commons statement on Monday before facing questions from MPs.
She was also expected to ask the Speaker for permission to hold an emergency debate in Parliament on the issue of Syria.
He said with or without the vote it would be "largely symbolic" and would mainly just acknowledge that Parliament has had its say.
Her decision to authorise action without MPs' backing has been criticised by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said she could "easily" have recalled Parliament or delayed her decision until MPs returned to Westminster from the Easter recess.
Corbyn called for a new War Powers Act "so governments do get held accountable to Parliament for what they do in our name". - BBC

Buddha statue salvaged from sea near Galle Fort
A Buddha statue sunk in the sea near the ramparts of Galle Dutch Fort was detected and salvaged by a young diver who was viewing corals near the sea close to Galle Fort, yesterday.
The statue is over 40kg and was found in the sea about 150 to 200 metres away from Galle Fort.
The youth, who used to dive in the sea around Galle Fort frequently, had observed the statue submerged in the sea while diving with one of his friends, yesterday. However, at first sight of the artefact, the young man had been shocked to see it and had swiftly emerged out of the sea. Out of curiosity of the unexpected sight, he dove again to the same spot with his friend, picked the statue up and brought to Sri Sudharmalaya Temple in Galle Fort.
It was handed over to the Chief Incumbent of the temple Ven. Panangala Hemaloka Thera, who in turn informed Galle Police and the Department Archeology, Galle about the object.
Subsequently, when contacted, Galle District Assistant Archeology Director Wasantha Alahakoon said that they had arranged to carry out a comprehensive study on the salvaged Buddha statue by a special research officer.
They would be able to determine the authenticity of the item only after a proper research and if found to be an artefact with antique value, the Archeology Department would take the statue into their custody, she said.

Capacity building is a buzz word across many sectors other than perhaps in the sciences. Its also a term used extensively in grant and loan projects. In most instances, its applied to recipient countries and entities in the southern hemisphere. This article attempts to ask a few questions on this topic.
What are some reasons the global north usually gives for why the global south is the third world
International interactions between countries in the global north and countries in the global south are often one-sided. Fair or not, there are many reasons governments of the global north give as to why countries in the "global south are so disadvantaged
First, the global north often claims that many governments of countries in the global south lack the capacity to govern. Governments in the global south, northern countries claim, are often some combination of the following: inept, unstable, one-dimensional, dictatorial, ego-maniacal, etc. Such claims argue that the governments of these countries are at fault for promoting cronyism, pursuing incomprehensible economic strategies, or misreading and misunderstanding the economic climate.
Another claim that is often repeated is that governments in the global south are often more susceptible to corruption, bribery, and cronyism.
Third, the global north regularly points to the fact that many global south governments are not well liked or trusted by their citizens. (This, they argue, hampers countrywide governance, increases corruption), and feeds the growth of uncontrollable "black markets".
To what extent are any of these claims true They remain true to the extent it's critically examined, remain unanswered and we continue to accept our southern hemisphere basket status categorization.
A story from Sri Lanka 
Many projects land with their lead resource persons backed by consultants to build capacity and partnership amongst institutions. Their prescriptions relate how to fix the problem. Options include a needs assessment, building a database, organise ToTs, identify resource persons and conduct training preferably in a hotel.
The natives are thereafter invited to become beneficiaries. The back end donor will seek regular reports. If some funds are to be channelled to recipient countries they need local partners who in theory decide an action plan, allocate resources and implement activities. There is though a catch in this scheme. The investor has his own preferred partners and methods of doing business. He looks to buy into local organisations. He will ask to do an evaluation of the organisations capacity and in the process; vacuum-clean a whole bunch of information internal to the local organisations. He has his own office in the country. Ultimately directly or indirectly he will control the manner, in which funds are spent, ensure his favourites are part of the charmed circle. He may also engineer the need to manage the process with a local steering committee nominally in place, kept happy with occasional foreign trips.
President Magufuli: A good example of leadership and good governance in Africa
The Republic of Tanzania held Presidential elections in October 2015. Dr. John Pombe Magufuli was sworn in as president on November 5, 2015. President John Pombe Joseph Magufuli has since been declared the best President in the world by the United Nations Economic and Social Council during their annual review which was published on August 12, 2016. He previously held the post of Minister of Works where he earned the nickname bulldozer for steering the programme to build good roads. He was known to be a no-nonsense, results-driven politician and displayed great integrity by not giving in to multiple opportunities to make riches while he held this position.
Dr. Magufulis election has turned Tanzania into a rising star in Africa with a very healthy growth rate. Born in extreme poverty, he promised that as president, he would focus on fighting poverty, corruption and wasteful spending, which are problems that continue to plague many African nations. His policies also aim to enable regional trade, capitalize on the nations natural resources and facilitate increased industrialization.
He slashed the budget for the usually opulent opening of parliament by almost 90% and demanded that the money saved to be spent on purchasing hospital beds and on roadwork. He reduced the size of the presidential convoy, as well as the size of the presidential delegation that travels with him.
A month after taking office, he finally announced his Cabinet made up of 19 ministries. It had 11 fewer ministries than the previous government; some were merged to save money. He publicly warned those selected as ministers and other government officials that he would not tolerate corruption, laziness or excessive bureaucracy. He told them they should expect nothing more than to work tirelessly to serve the people of the country alongside him.
He put a stop to the public procurement of goods and services at inflated costs. He declared that anyone found procuring public goods or services at inflated prices will be fired. He ordered an immediate ban on foreign travels by public servants on his third day in office and put a stop to the purchase of first-class tickets. He stated that all tasks that necessitated government officials to travel abroad will now be done by the countrys high commissioners and ambassadors abroad. As an example, he once trimmed down a delegation of 50 set to tour Commonwealth countries to just four. And the ban on foreign travel helped the government save at least $429.5 million between November 2015 and November 2016.
He decreed that henceforth, government meetings would be held in state buildings rather than in expensive hotels. He called on all public institutions to significantly cut expenditure on refreshments during meetings. He also issued a directive for unnecessary physical meetings to be stopped and for public servants to conduct conference calls instead. This is to cut unnecessary costs that the government incurred from meetings and conferences.
Dr. Magufuli has focused on revenue collection which has helped the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) go from raising 900 billion Shillings monthly to more than 1.8 trillion Shillings.
He made education free for children whose parents couldnt afford it. A promise he made during his election campaign. He also directed relevant authorities to sort and resolve the problems stopping the release of education loans.
In the spirit of fighting incompetence, laziness and corruption, he had warned everybody to take notice of what he had said in terms of delivery, efficiency and honesty. No more warnings were issued. On Law Day (February 4, 2016), President Magufuli called upon the Chief Justice to quickly embark on the establishment of a Special High Court to swiftly deal with cases of corruption.
Over his first three months in office, he fired more than 150 senior civil servants among which were top officials of the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA), the director of the Prevention and Combating of Corruption Bureau (PCCB), the Commissioner General of the Immigration Services Department, the Managing Director of Reli Assets Holding (RAHCO), and the Director General of Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority. Most civil servants were fired in a dramatic fashion without mentioning their wrongdoing, and some of them decided to sue the government in court.
Over 10,000 ghost workers were also rooted from various government departments.
President Magufuli made surprise raids at government offices to see for himself who was at their desks, who was absent and who had used the well-worn trick of leaving their jackets on the chairs to indicate they had just stepped out for a moment when in fact they were gone weeks.
He went to the federal hospital, the Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH), unannounced and made sure to visit all the wards, including those kept from high profile visitors like himself. He discovered the hospital in a deplorable state, with key diagnostic equipment such as the CT-Scan and MRI not working. Patients who needed to undergo testing had to pay exorbitant fees for the services at private hospitals. He fired the director and the hospital board and ordered that the equipment that was working be repaired or replaced within two weeks, otherwise the newly appointed director will also be fired. New CT-Scan and MRI machines were installed in three days!
The example that President Magufuli has set is what Africa needs now. Additionally, Tanzania has been an example in terms of democracy on the African continent, specifically with presidential term limits.
The moral of this article is we are not stupid, incompetent or incapable. Let's not allow others to treat us like fools. As in Tanzania we have men and women with the necessary local capacity. Let's not forget that and barter away our self-respect.

Channel 9 loses cricket TV rights after 40 years
SYDNEY, Sunday - Channel Nine, which brought cricket to Australian television viewers for 40 years and influenced the way the sport is covered around the world, has lost a billion dollar bidding duel for broadcasting rights to Australias national game.
Cricket Australia announced it had concluded a new rights deal with free-to-air broadcaster Channel Seven and its pay TV partner Foxtel reportedly worth $1 billion over six years.
For four decades Nines cricket coverage had been an omnipresent feature of the Australian summer, bringing test, one-day matches and Twenty20 internationals into living rooms across the nation. Its style of using a large stable of high profile former players to provide idiosyncratic commentary in a manner which departed from crickets former, stuffy manner won it fans, and critics, around the world.
It became the template for television coverage and commentary in almost every other nation where cricket is played. Headed for more than three decades by former Australian captain Richie Benaud, with regular commentators such as test greats Tony Greig, Bill Lawrie, Ian Chappell and, more recently Shane Warne, Nine provided an enormous resource of expert analysis based on experience.

Cooking with love for this Awurudu
Combining the best of the ethnic cuisine, the Avurudu table is filled with sweet, soft and crispy goodies. From the traditional milk rice to delicacies like Unduwal, Naran Kavum and Aggala, an important aspect of the Avurudu season is about laying out a scrumptious feast to share with your family and loved ones. These festive foods are all about tradition and the memories associated with them.
Sweet meats and special dishes are an essential facet of the Avurudu season. While they have come to be identified with the annual festival, some of these food items are also prepared to mark special occasions. However it is during the Avurudda that food mainly takes its pride of place.
Known for her popular Youtube videos about whipping up a range of scrumptious dishes culinary expert Anoma Wijetungas name has become synonymous with cooking today. The soft spoken lady with her infectious smile and motherly voice has taught many a youth to make gastronomic delights through the recipes she prepares in Anomas Kitchen. Her famous tag line Cooking With Love reflects the success of her culinary techniques.
Culinary expert Anoma Wijetunga.Picture by Ruwan de Silva
Anoma says that though items like kokis have originated from the Dutch, kevum can be termed as our own.
Different types of food items are associated with different provinces. Athirasa is famous in the South while aluwa and bibbikan (a type of coconut cake) are associated with the hill country."
Speaking about the sweetmeats available at the stores Amona notes that one cannot be sure about the quality of the products though they may look and taste nice.
For example you cannot be sure how many times the oil has been reused to fry products. This poses future health risks. The kokis too does not taste creamy. Food bought from shops is never on par with those made at home, she stressed.
She notes that out of all the Avurudu delicacies aasmi is the most difficult to make.
You need to find the leaves of a special species of cinnamon called Davul Kurundu to make it in the correct manner. Once you add this to the mixture, the mixture flows steadily into the hot oil. You also need to have the practice to make kevum properly especially since you need to use both your hands in the process, she said.
One of the frequent mistakes which occur in making Avurudu sweetmeats is getting the proportions wrong. Even the pani pol has to be taken off the heat at the correct time.
All this knowledge comes with practice. At times you cannot show the exact quantity you need to use because it also depends on the quality of your product, she added.
For Anoma the Sinhala and Tamil New Year has always been associated with food. She says that the Sinhala pickle was one of the most prominent food items during the season in her home when she was a child.
Sinhala pickle is different from Malay pickle. It is not sweet and it has a lot of raw papaya cut into thin strips. Malay pickle includes dates and sugar, she mused.
Anomas love for culinary arts has developed due to her mother engaging them in cooking during their school holidays.
One of the techniques Anoma uses to keep the consumption of sweet and oily food consumption in check is to make the food in small quantities.
If I make a pol cake I cut it into small slices. Sweetmeats are in abundance during Avurudu time and people have developed the habit of grabbing something from the table and popping it into their mouth as they pass by. This way they will consume smaller portions, she explained with a smile.
Queried on what one can serve visitors other than the traditional sweetmeats Anoma says that it is best to make a batch of cutlets or pattis and store them in the freezer a few days before the Avurudda.
Since Avurudu sweetmeats like kevum and kokis are in abundance during this period. You can be sure that these homemade savouries will not be wasted. You can also make a quick sandwich by smashing some Ambul Thiyal and adding some onion and green chili pieces into the mixture. You can even make some spicy kokis to add a difference to the traditional recipe, Anoma opined adding that pan cakes filled with pani pol too can be made in a jiffy.
Since it is humid these days Anoma recommends ice tea to be given to visitors.
You can even have some ice coffee but if you have an iced tea you can even watch the amount of sugar that you will consume, she advised though there are a variety of flavoured teas to choose from to make the ice tea you can use natural ingredients to favour the beverage.
She says that a pineapple pudding or a fruit platter goes well with the Avurudu lunch.
If you are short of time to make a pudding get two flavours of ice cream. Roast some cashew and sprinkle it on top of the two scoops. You can even add an anamalu and make a banana boat. Make chocolate sauce and pour a bit on top. It would make a delicious dessert, she expressed.
Avurudu has lost most of its significance because it has become commercialized today. People tend to buy clothes regularly. She says that she as a child she used to wait till the Avurudda drew near to get new clothes.
Anoma laments that today many take the easy way out by buying Avurudu sweetmeats from the supermarkets.
We get the real essence of the Avurudda when we make them at home. Nothing can beat the delicious aroma of the kevum and kokis sizzling on the stove and the fun one gets from cooking them together. Small children would definitely enjoy this sight and they would relate to the Avurudda more if they get to experience making kevum, kokis or other Avurudu food items. That is why I would advice housewives to cook at least one type of Avurudu sweetmeat at home. The Avurudda comes only once a year. Food binds people together. If someone knows that you cook delicious food they like to visit and dine in. So make an effort to celebrate it with the family with some home cooked food, she concluded.

CTU protests reassignment of  Uva Education Minister
The Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) yesterday protested against the reappointment of Uva Province Chief Minister Chamara Sampath Dassanayake as the Provinces Education Minister.
Dassanayake was asked to step down from his post as the provinces Education Minister after having humiliated and threatened Badulla Tamil Girls School Principal R. Bawani on January 3. Following protests against his actions, President Maithripala Sirisena had removed him from his position until investigations were to be concluded.
The Chief Minister, according to the Union, was reinstated last week, prior to former Uva Province Governor M. P. Jayasinghe being transferred to the North Central Province.
We see that this has been a drama; an election trick. The Magistrates case against him has not concluded and the Human Rights Commission is still conducting investigations, but he has been reinstated, CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin said.
He added that the Union, together with other organisations, would take action against the reinstatement after schools reopen. They have already sent a letter to the President, protesting Dassanayakes reappointment.

Dawn of a new season
The New Year season or the Bak Maha of 1945 happened to be a time of a turning point in my life. We lived in Gampaha and from time to time. We were forced to go to our maternal ancestral house in Alawatupitiya in Seeduwa. We had to travel by a buggy cart chauffeured by an elderly man named Singhappu. My mother called him Singhappu Ayya. We followed her way of addressing.
My grandmother addressed my mother as Lily Baba or Baby Lily. She looked after the ancestral house with the assistance of my three uncles and two aunties and looked forward to seeing us during the New Year. That was to enjoy the festive rituals as a cluster family. The words I remember of my grandmother: Lily Babo, now that the World War is gone, why dont we have a good time Make us a visit with the little ones. I will send Singhappu with the buggy cart. I am ready and waiting for you.
These words still reverberate in my ears.
Wartime transmitter site
About four days before the beginning of the New Year Singhappu Siya arrived in our place. My elder sister, brother and I got into the buggy cart with our mother, and travelled along the Ekala Road, passing the wartime transmitter site in Ekala that leads to Seeduwa.
My mother had bought quite a lot of presents for my grandmother and the uncles and the aunts who flocked to greet us as we entered the ancestral house. The presents were mainly new clothes. Sarongs and shirts for males and multi-coloured cheettaya cloths for females. Even the two female servants were given presents. For the first time, I was amazed to see the eatables laid on the great big table in the long spacious dining room. For the New Year lunch, it was quite usual on the part of the grandmother to prepare one delicious curry known as hat maluva. This consists of seven types of ingredients that possessed herbal value, devoid of any fish or meat.
At the dining table, grandmother would relate the Pattini legend.
Pattini the noblewoman of chastity happens to be the goddess who guards the New Year rituals. She and her husband Kovalan are regarded as the ideal husband and wife who lived in the utmost happy state of their existence giving an example to all of us. An amorous king killed her husband. Then the lamenting Pattini made a vow that she would not move away from the dead body of her husband until he comes to life again.
Greatest merriment
She also prayed that one who killed her husband ought to be punished by bringing about seasonal disasters like fire and wind. It so happened that seven directions of fauna and flora went dry as the sun in the sky sympathised with her. Then the God of gods, Sakra, brought back to the life the husband Kovalan. This happened to be the greatest merriment as happiness to Pattini, but also all those who understand her lamentations. This merriment is the joy of the New Year. Rains poured down. The sun shone mildly giving life to plants. The trees were full up with fruits of all kinds.
The seven types of herbal curries, hatmaluva, then came from seven directions. They include vattakka, alu kesel, jak seeds, brinjal and mae karal. But later on I discovered that the seven types of vegetables vary from district to district retaining the main principles of vegetarianism as a guiding factor. I too found and understood from the grandmother that all the indoor and outdoor games that villagers play are based on the legend of Pattini and Kovalan. The two teams known by the villages and udupila and yatipila are represented by two characters Pattini and Kovalan. Even the swing or the onchillawa is symbolic of the couple.
The Onchili varam or the rhythmic songs are sung by those who use the swing sing songs of praise of Pattini and Kovalan. I too discovered that the New Year season is packed with blessings of varying types. As such, it embraces socio-religious nuances in all activities, my grandmother gets down new clay pots to cook the New year meals as a beginning of a new life. She makes the well, the water drawing fountain as a close relation. As such the primary transaction I with the well, into which she drops a new coin. All the animals of the house feel well and looked after like close companions. Attending the temple walking all the way to perform religious rituals take place in keeping with the auspicious time as indicated in the almanack, provided by the head priest of the temple. Just before the New Year, a representative patron from the temple comes with a lita or the nakath seettuwa which gives all the auspicious times.
Our grandmother had the habit of reading aloud the sacred religious books in order to attune our minds to the passing of the non-auspicious time, indicated as the time of preparation where wishes are made by individuals that will yield the results all throughout the dawn of a new year. We were socialized to the fact that anger, ill will and hatred are wiped off with the dawn of a New Year where prosperity or Bak remains the constant factor.

Celebrating the New Year   the Sri Lankan way
Everythings in bloom!
April brings in the richness of colour, scent and sound. The bright red erabadu flowers in bloom, the rhythmic beats of the raban sessions, the haunting notes of the koel bird echoing through the air and the sweet aromas of the kavum (oil cakes), kokis and other Avurudu sweetmeats wafting from the kitchens are all cues that the Sinhala and Tamil New Year is here again.
Other activities take a backbench as the country prepares to celebrate its most significant and joyous annual celebration. The Sinhala and Tamil New Year festivities are unique to Sri Lanka because they are not celebrated in any other nation as a national festival. This is the time of year when everything is rejuvenated and in bloom.
Known as Aluth Avurudda in Sinhala and Puthandu in Tamil, the Sinhala and Tamil New Year is based on the journey of the sun as it moves from the House of Pisces (Meena Rashiya) to the House of Aries (Mesha Rashiya). Although the New Year falls on April 14 annually, preparations for the festivities begin several weeks in advance. The event signifies the reaping of the harvest and the social customs of the farming community. Homes are cleaned and whitewashed. New clothes are stitched or bought. Old debts are paid off and grudges are forgotten. This is the time of togetherness and forgiveness as the mind is freed from burdens and open to receiving the blessings of the New Year. Women, especially the elder folk, gather together to make sweetmeats of all sorts from the golden kevum (oil cakes) to the crispy kokis (deep fried delicacy made of rice flour and coconut milk), sweet athirasa (flat handmade oil cakes), diamond shaped mung kevum (a sweetmeat made of mung beans) and white aasmi adorned with colourful syrup. Tamil New Year delicacies include items like laddu, bars of kesari and jangiri.
This is the best time for store keepers as people throng shops and pavements hunting for items to combine with the festivities. Those who have ventured to cities to find employment get an opportunity to visit their village and spend several days in the company of their family and loved ones.
The day before the New Year is called the Old year (Parana Avurudda). People set aside the old and get ready to embrace the new on this particular day. In some areas it is a part of their tradition to bathe in a mixture of herbs like lime and sandalwood. This signifies washing away impurities and is known as Nanumura Mangalyaya.
Nonagathaya aka a time which is neither auspicious nor inauspicious occurs when the sun is in transit between the Aries Pisces and the Aries. People cease to engage in work and take up religious activities.
The Aluth Avurudda happens when the suns transit is complete. The Sinhala and Tamil communities welcome this event amid the sound of fire crackers. Temple Bells chime to evoke blessing for the New Year.
The traditional lighting of the stove marks the first New Year tradition. The mother of the house faces the auspicious direction and clad in the auspicious shade of clothes she worships the pot thrice before lighting the stove. Milk is usually boiled to overflow the pot. Then milk rice is prepared. Milk rice is a sign of prosperity and an essential item on the Avurudu table.
The head of the household lights the oil lamp at the table. Then turning towards the auspicious direction the first morsel of food is consumed by him or her. Then he or she feeds the rest of the family. Children worship the elders by handing betel leaves, putting together their hands, bending and touching their feet. The elders in turn bless them and give gifts or money. Portions of food are set aside for the deities before the whole family sits down to enjoy the delicacies.
The oil anointing ceremony takes place either at home or at the temple. It signifies bodily and spiritual well being. People stand upon the recommended leaves, roots and flowers to receive the anointment from wither the temple monk or the most senior member in the household. It is said that the leaves used for the anointment are selected in relation to the day of the week on which the rituals have to be performed: Imbul on Sundays, Divul on Mondays, Kolong on Tuesdays, Kohomba on Wednesdays, Bo on Thursdays, Karanda on Fridays and Nuga on Saturdays.
Conducting transactions too take place at an auspicious time. This is done with the belief that all transactions that take place during the following year will be blessed. The tradition is to wrap some money in a betel leaf and hand it to someone who returns money in a similar manner. Today, Banks are open for a short period during this time so that people may make a deposit and receive some token from the Bank in exchange. Similarly a transaction takes place with the water-well in village areas. Here coins, jasmine flowers and a piece of coal are put into the well in exchange for a new pot of water. The Sinhala folk call these transactions ganudenu, while the Tamil name them as kai vishesham.
The first ritual that the Tamil community performs for the New Year is a bath. Water is prepared with a special mixture of herbs and flowers for this purpose. This is believed to cleanse the body of evil and disease. New clothes of the auspicious colour are donned to visit the kovil after which they return home to be blessed by their elders.
A steel vessel filled with water, mango leaves and a coconut is placed upon a banana leaf with paddy, fruit and betel leaves and surrounded by oil lamps to welcome the New Year. Tables are spread with sweet delicacies.
Another unique aspect about the Sinhala and Tamil New Year is in its games. They bring all the communities together. Ancient sports and modern innovative games are part and parcel of Avurudu festivals which are conducted in every village during this period. Indoor games consist of games like pancha which can be termed as the Sri Lankan version of Ludo played with a board, dice and sea shells and olinda which is played on a wooden board with the red seeds of the liquorice tree. Races, tugs-of-war (Kamba Adeema), kotta pora, (challenging rounds of pillow fighting), breaking the pots (Kanamutti Bindeema), placing the eye on the elephant (Aliyata Asa Thabeema), climbing the greasy pole (Lissana Gaha Nageema) and riding the swing are some of the popular outdoor sports associated with the New Year festivities. One of the highlights of a New Year festival is the beauty contest to choose the Avurudu prince and princess.
Since Avurudu spells family time, relatives and loved ones make it a point to visit their friends and give them gifts. The final ritual of the celebration is returning to work which too is done at an auspicious date and time. This too is linked with the belief that they will enjoy success in their careers throughout the year.

The COPE Reports - Part 1
Expenses to watch out for
The Government is entrusted with billions of rupees of public funds, collected from the people. It has a duty to account for them and use them in accordance with the wishes of Parliament, without excess, extravagance or waste.
Ensuring the money is properly used is the responsibility of Parliament which works through two Committees, the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA) and the Committee on Public Enterprises. COPA scrutinises the Government, its Ministries, Departments, Provincial Councils and Local Authorities while COPE scrutinises public corporations and business undertakings.
Summarised are some findings of the 1st COPE report. The COPE, by its own admission, is under-resourced. It lacks staff particularly for audit and legal support. They also lack IT systems and apparently, even a proper office.
Despite these limitations and the fact that the reports are not comprehensive-they have examined a limited number of issues in a few institutions, they are a devastating critique of the state of governance. This is only the tip of a very large iceberg and underlines the need for a drastic re-think in the role of government.
A few highlights are presented below.
The Committee on Public Enterprises

With a fresh bowl of rice
The farmers in ancient India and Sri Lanka performed religious ceremonies connected with agriculture, their main livelihood. These ceremonies were in the form of poojas or offerings made to deities and also to the souls of their departed relatives, By these ceremonies people sought blessings and protection for their crops, cattle, their future well being, and in addition happiness and prosperity in all their endeavours.
With the introduction of Buddhism, these religious practices continued in Sri Lanka, in the form of offerings made in the name of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. The practice of making offerings to the Sri Maha Bodhi in Anuradhapura was made from the freshly harvested paddy crop and the ceremony came to be known as Aluth Sahal Mangalya.
Blessed people
This year this religious ceremony was held at the Sri Maha Bodhi and was followed by a Pirith ceremony invoking blessings on the people and country.
A portion of the paddy harvested during Maha cultivation was set aside by the farmers at the Kamatha (threshing floor). The paddy was then pounded by men and rice obtained was taken for the offering at the Sri Maha Bodhi.
The paddy was from fields lying in the east direction. The paddy thus obtained is called by different names such as Agahas, Agasas, Akbatha, Mulyala, and Akyala.
Farmers always retained the freshness and purity of the paddy selected for Aluth Sahal Mangalya. Farmers in Sath Korale followed a different method of performing the ceremony.
They erected a hut on the threshing floor where the paddy was pounded by men and thereafter took their portion of paddy to the irrespective homes.
The Mahavamsa mentions how King Mahatissa went in disguise and reaped the harvest from a field and received his share of paddy as payment for his labour. Out of the share of rice he thus obtained he made the offering and participated in the ceremony Another text Sanyanjatha Malaya mentions how King Devanampiyatissa went in disguise and worked in a field and obtained his share of rice which he then made as an offering to a Bhikkhu in the manner of Aluth Sahal Mangalya.
At the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the annual Aluth Sahal Mangalya is held a few days before the Duruthu Pasalosvake Poya which is followed by similar ceremonies in the other devalas in the districts. These religious ceremonies connected with the cultivation of fields take the form of thanksgiving to the Buddha and deities whom they respect and venerate.
Auspicious paddy
The ancient practice had been for astrologers to fix two Nekath times or auspicious times, one to bring paddy to the respective homes and the other to partake of the meal.
During the Kandyan times of the kings freshly harvested Paddy in clean bags and clay pots brought on elephants from Gabadagama and Viharagama to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. Paddy was brought to devalas and the royal palace in specially prepared clean bags which were known asghoni.
When paddy was brought to the Aluth Sahal Mangalya, the Adikarams and Chiefs received the party and escorted them to the Mahamaluwa where they waited till the nekath time was announced by the firing of a gun.
King Veera Parakarama Narandrasinha of Kundasale fame gifted his stretch of Gurudeniya fields to the Sri Delada Maligawa for the performance of the Aluth Sahal Mangalya. Thus began the practice of bringing paddy from Gurudeniya which is continued to this day. This gift of fields covers 18 annual equivalent to 30 acres in sowing extent.
According to the ancient practice, there were two Nekath times one to bring rice from Gunadeniya, and the other to prepare aims from the new rice for the Buddha Pooja. There was a barn erected at Gurudeniya to store paddy collected from the fields. The paddy was brought in a perahara and before it commenced, the party from Kandy was received by Gurudeniya Vidane and seven garnaralas.
Betel leaves
They welcomed the visitors, the Diyawadana Nilame and Basnayake Nilames of the four devalas by offering them with a sheaf of betel leaves.
Having received them, the Vidane and Gamaralas offered them meals before leaving for Kandy. Hewisi and reciting the virtues of the Buddha were made by the dancers as the prelude to the setting out. Kapuralas of the devales recite their sthothra (devotional stanzas).
In the distribution of rice, the Sri Dalada Maligawa, the four devalas in Kandy; Asgiriya and Malwatta Viharas and two Maha Viharas mentioned in Nampotha received their shares. And additional share was offered to the Gunagarama Viharaya.
The Lekam Mohottala of the Sri Dalada Maligawa read out from the Lekam-Mitiya or register, the names of Viharas and devalas to which rice should be distributed. When the names were read out, the first recipient being the Diyawadana Nilame, takes a silver neliya with him and receives a neliya full of rice as a token allotted to the Sri Dalada Maligawa. The rest of the rice was measured by Minanna. The participants of the perahara of the Sri Dalada Maligawa and four devalas spend the night at Gangarama Vihara while the others disperse on the same day to their viharas and devalas taking rice with them.
On the following day, the Aluth Sahal Mangalya perhara takes the new rice and leaves it at Sri Dalada Maligawa till Duruthu Pasalosvaka Poya. On the poya80 measures of rice is boiled and it is filled in the bowl known as Kiribodapatra and make the offering to Sri Dalada.
Religious ceremony
It is believed that the offering accrues great merit to each one who takes part in filling the bowl and in the Buddha Pooja. This offering of rice as a religious ceremony has been continued throughout. Anyone who attempted to cancel or tried to disrupt it would undergo hardships was mentioned in an inscription, In the Third Century, when the Sri Dalada was brought to Sri Lanka and placed at Isurumuniya Vihara also known earlier as the Issarasamanaka where offerings and religious ceremonies were held to Vessavalahaka deity which can be considered as the beginning of Buddhist ceremonies in Sri Lanka.

Half of IDPs  can be resettled with latest  land release
With the latest release of lands in Thelippalai recently, 50 percent of those currently in IDP centres would be able to return to their rightful lands, Commander, Security ForceJaffna, Major General Darshana Hettiarrachchi said.
The Sri Lanka Army, in keeping with the governments policy of returning lands held by the military to its rightful owners, released another 683 acres of land to 964 families (3309 members), at a ceremony presided over by Army Commander Lt.General Mahesh Senanayake at Mailadi on April 13.
Under the guidance of Major General Hettiarrachchi, lands belonging to four GS Divisions in Theleppalai DS Division were handed over to civilians who were in IDP camps or living with relatives.
Accordingly, the land was handed over to the Jaffna District Secretary, Nagalingam Vethanayaham, to be handed over to the rightful owners after due process.
According to Major General Hettiarrachchi, this was a goodwill gesture towards the people of Jaffna for the New Year.
Meanwhile, the Army Commander speaking at the ceremony said the Kankesanthurai to Point Pedro road could now be used for public transport and for their private vehicles between 6 am to 7 pm. Army Commander Senanayake said, This is your Army. This is the Army of the country.
Our responsibility is to ensure the well-being of citizens of this island, whether it is the South or North, irrespective if whether they are Sinhala, Muslim, Tamil, Buddhist, Christian, Islamic or any other race or religion.
The District Secretary (Jaffna), Additional Secretary (Land), Divisional Secretary (Theleppalai), beneficiaries, villagers and several Senior Army Officers and Army personnel also attended the ceremony.
Speaking to the Daily News Major General Darshana Hettiarrachchi said its been nine years since the war ended and it would not be fair to allow them to be living in IDP centres under difficult conditions.
These people have suffered for a long time and they deserve to have their lands back and to return to their peaceful living. We have moved our military establishments into the army cantonment area so that these lands could be returned to the people.
Meanwhile, the Jaffna SF Commander refuted allegations that the releasing of these lands could pose a threat to the Palali airport etc.
He said, due measures have been taken to fortify the security requirements in the area to ensure the safety of all. He noted that the Security Forces are there to safeguard the country and the Tri-Forces are very capable of their duties.
Hence, he said it was not required to hold onto peoples lands for security purposes and allow them to suffer in temporary shelters.
They too have the right to lead their normal lives and live in peace. If reconciliation is to happen, we must return their lands to them and not hold more than what is absolutely necessary.
The releasing of these lands are being done after meticulous consideration and planning and there is absolutely no threat to national security by returning these lands to these people, Maj. Gen. Hettiarachchi noted.

On the final day of the XXI Commonwealth Games Sri Lanka s Hiruni Wijeratne could not live up to expectations and had to finish her pet event the Marathon as the eleventh with a time of 2:49.38 secs.

were the silver and bronze medal winners respectively.
The Marathon which commenced at 7.45 a.m. was a disappointing one for all for athletes who competed in this event which attracted spectators of all walks of life.
Appearing under these terrific climatic conditions our local competitor for marathon had to be taken on a wheel chair as she looked so bad and she was suffering from dehydration. Hiruni with so much difficulty never wanted to give up the race and finished the event placed in the eleventh slot.
For Sri Lanka XXI Commonwealth Game in Gold Coast was the Best achieved by Lankans in past 68 years.
The best medal tally gained by Lankans in the past was only four but at Gold Coast Games our athletes came up with a good
show to increase the number of medals to six.
This was mainly due to the efforts of our Weight Lifters and Boxers who did well to bring these medals. On the opening day the wrestlers brought in the first medal a bronze for Sri Lanka. Following it the second day was another good day with a bronze and the final day of Wrestling saw a silver medal added to the total.
Two day later our boxers did well to enter the round two and continued their good work to enter the quarter final in almost every weight category.
The only woman boxer Ansha Kodituwakku who was in peak form boxed brilliantly and made her way to the quarters giving the hope of another medal but it did not happen as she had to confront worlds best female boxer M.C. Mer Kom from India and she had to bow out of the ring.

Former ICC president reacts to Asia Cup being moved to UAE:
India, Pak should play cricket, govts shouldnt intervene: Ehsan Mani
MUMBAI: Former ICC chairman Ehsan Mani has heard that the Asia Cup has been moved out of India to UAE, allegedly due to political tensions with Pakistan.
He said, There are two important issues here  firstly, under the current ICC Constitution there must be no government interference in cricket administration. This includes, discouraging or stopping teams from playing against any country. Secondly, the relationship between BCCI and PCB is historically at its lowest point.
When I became the Chairman and President of the ICC, India and Pakistan had not played against each other for several years. Board representatives such as General Tauqir Zia and Shaharyar Khan from Pakistan and their counterparts from BCCI such as Jagmohan Dalmiya, I S Bindra, Raj Singh Dungarpur and Sharad Pawar had excellent personal relations. At that time, the people who led BCCI and PCB were determined their cricket would not be affected by politics between the two countries.
Soon after I became head of ICC, I visited India and met several government ministers in the company of Dalmiya, Raj Singh and other senior BCCI officials. Similarly, I met with then Pakistan president, General Musharraf. The message that was given to the governments was that as cricket administrators, it was our responsibility to protect the game and we did not want politics to harm the cricket between the two countries.
We persevered in our efforts and eventually India toured Pakistan in 2004. The tour was an outstanding success. Several thousand Indian supporters visited Pakistan and were treated with love and affection; they went back to India overwhelmed by the hospitality they had received in Pakistan. Pakistans tour to India in 2005 was similarly a great success.
Cricket demonstrated it had the power to cut across politics which divide countries by the people-to-people contact it created, Mani said, adding: Look at what happened in the final of the last Champions Trophy in England. Thousands of India and Pakistan supporters sat together in a wonderfully friendly atmosphere at the Oval, supporting their respective teams and sharing a common love for the game.
Mani said: It is also important that those who run the Indian and Pakistan cricket boards should understand that they have an obligation to hundreds of millions of cricket fans around the world. An India-Pakistan match is bigger than any other sporting event.
These officials must work together to promote and protect the game of cricket, he said.

JO MP Aluthgamage  arrested, granted bail
Former Sports Minister and Joint Opposition (JO) MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage who was arrested yesterday by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) and produced before the Colombo Fort Magistrate, was ordered to be released on cash bail of Rs. 35,000 and two sureties of Rs.500,000 each.
Aluthgamages passport was also impounded.
The next court date was fixed for May 11, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara told the Daily News.
Aluthgamage was arrested when he arrived at the FCID to record a statement based on the allegations of misusing state funds.
The former Minister was summoned by the FCID pertaining to investigations that are currently being carried out by the FCID in connection with the alleged misappropriation of Rs 39 million for the purchase of carrom and checkers boards to Sathosa in 2014.
Addressing the media gathered outside the FCID, Aluthgamage said, If the government thinks they can put us behind bars and stop us going against them, they are sadly mistaken.
We will not stop this fight. No matter how much they put us behind bars, we will not stop until we have sent this government home.
I have brought my clothes with me, as I know they will charge me under the Public Property Act and deny me bail. The government is willing to do anything to stop us. I have no sadness but I we are ready to face any situation, Aluthgamage said.
Aluthgamage is facing allegations of having distributed of equipment worth around Rs.39 million to selected school and sports clubs for political purposes during the period he was the Sports Minister. Meanwhile, Aluthgamage had previously filed a special appeal petition to the Supreme Court seeking an order to prevent the FCID from arresting him. However, it was rejected by the Supreme Court without being taken up for hearing.
With regard to the same allegation of misappropriation of funds during the purchase of sports gear, the former Chairman of Sathosa, Nalin Ruwanjeewa Fernando, was arrested and remanded. But, later, he was granted bail on April 10.
Aluthgamage remanded for failure to meet bail conditions
MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage who was granted bail yesterday, was again ordered to be remanded until today, due to his failure to meet the bail conditions imposed by the Colombo Magistrates Court.
He had failed to produce a copy of his passport to the Court Registrar on time to process his release.
Aluthgamages passport is impounded by the Colombo High Court.

Man City eye record books after clinching titl
LONDON, Sunday - Champions Manchester City have set their sights on rewriting the record books after clinching the Premier League title.
Pep Guardiola's side were crowned kings of English football on Sunday as their arch rivals Manchester United slumped to a shock 1-0 defeat against struggling West Bromwich Albion.
City are 16 points clear of second placed United, who can only take a maximum of 15 points from their remaining matches.
Given the way they have demolished all challengers in the league, it was apparent months ago that it was only a matter of when rather than if City would take the title.
But sealing the silverware thanks to a slip from old enemies United and their boss Jose Mourinho -- a long-time rival of Guardiola -- was a sweet moment, especially after they lost to their neighbours in the Manchester derby last weekend.
Winning the title with five matches to go makes City the joint earliest champions in the Premier League era -- matching the achievement of the 2000-01 Manchester United team.
That is just one of a welter of statistical feats that have led some to rank City among the Premier League's greatest ever teams.
Whether they deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Manchester United's 1999 treble winners or the 2004 Arsenal Invincibles is up for debate.
But City, who will stage a title party when they host Swansea on Sunday, have a chance to underline their credentials over their last five matches.
Fuelled by the majestic form of Kevin De Bruyne, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling, City set a new Premier League record earlier this season by winning 18 successive matches.
The Premier League's record points tally of 95, set by Chelsea in 2004-05, is within City's reach if they can take nine from their last fixtures.
With 28 league victories so far, City need three more wins to top Chelsea's record of 30 Premier League wins in a season.
United hold the current record Premier League winning margin of 18 points and that could also fall to City.
City have won 14 games on the road this season and have two to go away from home -- winning both of those would beat Chelsea's record of 15.
Guardiola's players will focus on those targets once they have recovered from a boisterous evening of celebrations in Manchester.
Former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss Guardiola was all smiles when he was pictured arriving home after his golf outing.
City's title is the 24th trophy of his glittering career.
Speaking after Saturday's 3-1 win over Tottenham, the 47-year-old gave all the credit to his players. I am so glad to be here and be part of this club. These guys are fantastic, awesome, they are incredible, he said.
This club is absolutely amazing in all terms.
Third-placed Liverpool beat Bournemouth 3-0 at home with Mohamed Salah taking his goal tally for the season to 40 in all competitions  making him only the third Liverpool player to achieve that mark in a single campaign.
Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino were also on target as Liverpool moved three points above Tottenham.
Liverpool are 10 points above fifth-placed Chelsea who hit back from two goals down at relegation-haunted Southampton to win 3-2 and keep alive their hopes of a top-four finish.
Third-from-bottom Southampton are five points from the safety zone after relegation rivals Crystal Palace beat Brighton & Hove Albion by the same score at Selhurst Park and Huddersfield Town beat Watford 1-0.
Swansea City are directly above Southampton after drawing 1-1 at home to Everton.
The action was just as furious at Selhurst Park with all the goals coming in the opening 34 minutes, including a first-ever league double for Palaces Wilfried Zaha.
Huddersfield rose to 14th thanks to an injury-time goal by Tom Ince while Jordan Ayew returned from a three-match ban to earn Swansea a draw against Everton.
Burnley earned their fifth straight league win with a 2-1 victory over Leicester City at Turf Moor to boost their chances of possible Europa League qualification.

New dawn after New Year
It appears that the Yahapalanya government is set for a new beginning in the New Year, now that it is cleansed of all the elements that fouled the atmosphere, causing a huge stumbling block for the forward journey of the government. That it is poised to turn a new leaf and chart a fresh course will, no doubt, be welcomed by all those civil society groups and the rest who put their shoulders to the wheel to bring about the January 8 revolution, three years ago.
Speaking at a ceremony in Thalapathpitiya, on Thursday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the SLFP and UNP ministers will put their heads together and come up with a new programme for the government, shortly. He said, two ministerial groups from both the parties held discussions on the way ahead for the government on Wednesday night in the aftermath of the defection of 16 SLFP members. The SLFP ministers met the President prior to this meeting. We discussed on forging ahead with a new programme. I expect that we will receive it very soon so that we can go forward based on it, the Premier said.
Speaking to this newspaper, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said the meeting between the two groups was centred on evolving a common agenda for the government, rectifying the shortcomings in the past. Importantly, he said it was emphasized at the meeting that they would have one leadership and one programme if they are to govern together. There must be transparency and both parties must be kept in the loop, the minister said. He also said that a committee comprising members of both parties would be appointed to finalize the common policy framework agreed to by both parties.
It is also learnt that this committee would be chaired by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama, which bodes well for the success of the joint programme. To begin with, Dr. Amunugama was a former topnotch civil servant, and, though a SLFP minister, is known to profess liberal views and is a firm follower of the open economy, naturally having his apprenticeship in the UNP under JRJ, one would have thought. Thus he is certain not to dismiss out of hand, polices centred on the open economy, like the likes of Susil Premajayantha were wont to do, when drafting the new programme. The socialist economic policies of the SLFP was even discarded by CBK, who, no doubt, took a pragmatic view of things. Regrettably though, some in the Blue party still cling to the old shibboleths, perhaps to win favour with the rural voters which form the primary base of the SLFP.
Be that as it may, the new journey thus chartered by the unity government, hopefully, will not only bring new life and galvanize all sectors into action, but will also see a resurgence in the somewhat moribund state of affairs in government, brought about by political uncertainty. It was clearly apparent that the government was in a state of drift, particularly after the LG polls outcome, and the state apparatus virtually paralyzed, with officials reluctant to take decisions that would compromise them, resulting in chaos in the administration.
The government has a full two years to complete and it should not lose time in getting its act together, now that it has a cohesive unit to pilot its programme of work. Not just on the development front. There are still a host of pledges that are outstanding, the non implantation for which the unity government was given a resounding slap on February 10. Dealing with the crooks in the Rajapaksa government should be given priority, at least now. Here too there is the all too familiar stagnation that has been the hallmark of this government during the last three years, the upshot of all this being those involved in mega corruption taking holier than postures, going to the extent of even openly challenging the government.
Hopefully, the New Year would see a new dawn for the Yahapalanaya government, completely dispelling all bitterness and rancour among the ranks of the partners in the coalition paving the way for the work to get started in all earnest, with the President and Prime Minister leading the way.
Cat out of the bag
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is fond of engineering loads of visitors to descend on his ancestral home, Carlton every New Years day and this time too was no exception. An assorted group of well wishers were seen packed into the Rajapaksa abode, as shown on a private TV channel (Of course there was the unmistakable presence of JO MPs). A new element was added this year with groups of artistes too paying homage to the former President at his ancestral home in far away Tangalle, among them disabled actors and those very much in the evening of their lives, which makes one wonder if they made the trip on their own volition. However, the standout among the visitors were a group of parents of anti-SAITM students, who, while partaking of the Avurudu feast, brought up the subject of SAITM before MR.
Was this an indication of who was behind the protests

New species  of prawn import divides industry
"Five of the seven diseases have been proved negative which means there are no diseases to date. Two more results are pending and we are confident that all the results will come out as negative," said NAQDA President Upali Mohotti, who was also present at the media briefing
Prawns became the centre of controversy recently as reports emerged that a certain species of prawns imported by a multinational company with the authorisation of the National Aquaculture Development Authority (NAQDA) carried certain viruses in them.
The NAQDA and the Sri Lanka Aquatic Development Alliance (SLADA) exchanged allegations over the safety of the prawn species with each claiming that science was on their side.
A bit of history
Sri Lanka started its voyage into the prawn industry in 1982, 10 years after prawns were industrially grown in countries like USA, Japan and Western Europe. Today, Asian countries including Sri Lanka share 75 percent of the total prawn production in the world, while Latin American countries share the remaining 25 percent. Brazil happens to be the largest producer of prawns, while Thailand claims the number one position in exports.
Two types of prawns are cultivated by this industry worldwide - the Penaeus mondon and the Penaeus vannamei. In Sri Lanka, at present we only farm the Penaeus mondon variety. In the past couple of years however, the Sri Lanka prawn industry experienced many setbacks with many diseases adversely affecting the continuity of the industry in the country. The most recent disease occurred in 2004 when the white spot disease plagued the industry and huge losses were incurred by the breeding centres.
Discussions were held during the last two years to find a solution to the continuous losses and a proposal was made to import the other type of prawn, Penaeus vannamei, into the country. Fifty couples of prawns imported from Hawaii were cleared on the morning of April 8, but this caused a stir among the prawn community regarding the safety of the imported items. The total import of prawns weighed 550 kg and the consignment was transported to a breeding centre at Nainamadama in Puttalam District.
The blame game
When the Daily News inquired into the matter with the NAQDA, they stated that a certificate was obtained by the Veterinary Authority of Hawaii stating that the prawns were free of disease. The authority accused SLADA, a non-government alliance of individuals in the fishing community, for spreading false information and stated that SLADA had always wanted to bring the imported shipment to the country.
SLADA in the meantime were the first to raise their voice against the imported shipment of Penaeus vannamei prawns. The alliance stated that the disasters relating to this type of prawns were evident in the countries of Thailand and India.
"We are not against the importing of new types of seafood into the country. We wanted to import this type of species under a specific set of guidelines and assessments. We have to be careful when we import an alien species. We have found out that these prawns carry seven diseases including a virus," said SLADA President Kamal Nanayakkara.
Addressing a media briefing in the wake of such statements, on April 10, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera stated that all allegations were false.
The minister asked the public not to panic and stated that NAQDA was conducting experiments to assess the disease status of the prawns.
"Five of the seven diseases have been proved negative which means there are no diseases to date. Two more results are pending and we are confident that all the results will come out as negative," said NAQDA President Upali Mohotti, who was also present at the media briefing.
Alienated from procedure
While the two aquaculture organisations exchange allegations with each other, attention should be fixed to a more serious matter at hand. Both government institutions related to this import - Sri Lanka Customs and the NAQDA - were at a loss when it came to the process of issuing permits for these imports.
Senior Lawyer and Environmentalist Jagath Gunawardena speaking to the Daily News explained that a strict legal procedure needed to be followed when importing a new alien species to the country.
"If any authority wants to introduce a specific species to the country, there is a proper procedure to be followed, stated Gunawardena. The authorities should follow the National Policy on Introduction of Alien Invasive Species. This policy calls for the need of a mandatory risk assessment before importing a species. The authorities responsible for the introduction should consider the problems and risks related to the new species and should formulate and present the ways to cope with and mitigate the risks."
He further said, "According to directive principles of state policies stated in the Constitution of the country, no government authority, agent, cooperation, department or ministry can bypass or overlook a national policy in taking decisions."
Thus he accused NAQDA of not following these particular protocols when importing the shipment of Penaeus vannamei prawns.
Penaueus mondon.
"Any animal should be introduced to the country by a certificate from the Wildlife Conservation Department which is the requirement under Section 37 of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance which has not been complied with. They further have to get clearance from the country of import and the Department of Animal Protection has to identify that it is free from diseases, pests or other pathogens and a letter of recommendation should be provided to the import and export controller to which the permit would be given," he explained.
However, when the Daily News questioned Mohotti about this, he simply stated that the Wildlife authority had nothing to do with regard to this matter.
This particular shipment was held back and later released by Customs officials which makes matters worse when considering the subject of legality. The Customs media spokesperson stated that the Customs approved the shipment after a valid permit was given. When asked about the permit, he stated that NAQDA issued a permit named 'NQ/5/8/3/1/ of January 1, 2018' and the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Department provided a permit named '2018/3'. However, such permits would not be valid without the certificate of the Wildlife authority which is stated under Section 37 of the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
Causing ripples
Gunawardena in addition noted that this species of prawns may cause some ripples in the aquaculture community,
"This type of Penaeus vannamei' prawns are a naturally occurring species in the Pacific region and when introduced to other areas for aquaculture purposes, they are prone to diseases. India and Thailand too have many experiences with this species carrying diseases of other types of prawn into their industry.
This new type of shrimp is also a natural competitor of the Penaeus mondon shrimp which lives in Sri Lankan waters and this could affect the local shrimps.
Penaeus vannamei shrimps are known for their predatory skills which would affect the other aquatic life and the new competition could have this new type of shrimp be a serious alien invasive species for years to come, explained the environmentalist further.
While the fishing community awaits the results of the assessments to determine the safety of these prawns, it is also necessary that they learn the legal matters at hand.
If not handled properly, the Penaeus vannamei prawn can spell disaster to the Sri Lankan prawn industry and the authorities need to communicate swiftly with the grassroots to avoid another alien species wreaking disaster in the island.

New Zealand stun Fiji to seal Commonwealth rugby double
GOLD COAST, Sunday - New Zealand shut out Olympic champions Fiji 14-0 to seal a gold medal double at the Commonwealth Games after winning the inaugural women's title in extra-time on Sunday.
New Zealand's fifth victory in six finals at the Games came after their women's team downed Australia 17-12 in sudden-death.
Kelly Brazier's sudden-death try from inside her own half sealed the thrilling victory for the Kiwi women.
The men's final wasn't anywhere as exciting as the clinical New Zealanders killed off the game with two early converted tries against a ragged Fiji.
We watched the women go into overtime and their win at the end really inspired us to get the double, skipper Tim Mikkelsen said.
Not many guys in this team would know the feeling of a gold medal. I got one in Delhi (2010) and was part of the team that lost in Glasgow, so to get this win is amazing. Fiji, who won last week's Hong Kong sevens, were bidding for their first Commonwealth gold after taking silver behind New Zealand in the inaugural sevens in 1998 and again in 2002.  AFP

The painting  is on the wall
Sculptures and inscriptions apart from information about dance can be gathered from paintings, which adorned the walls of the dance halls, and the temple courtyards. Indian paintings can be viewed regionally, for instance, north Indian paintings are different from the south Indian paintings. The south Indian paintings can be viewed according to the linguistic, religious, regional, and social factors. Mainly in the south Indian paintings, one sees the sketch work, and colour paintings. Most of these paintings reflect the social, political and cultural influence of that time.
Wall painting of Chola dynasty.
The sketches existed in ancient times, are evidenced by certain verses, appearing in the epic Manimekali, and Nedunelvadi.
Brahmins art 
Certain verses in ancient works show that in order to enable the dancers to learn the dance strictly, according to the tradition, they were encouraged to learn from the works on paintings.
Silapathikaram, the ancient Tamil classic, states that in the dance hall where, Mathavi held the arangetram, there were four paintings, depicting Brahmins, Kings, Merchants, and vellalas.
One of the paintings depicts Lord Shiva seated on a tiger skin and watching a dance performance of the Apsaras. Another painting depicts, the cosmic dance of Lord Nataraja, watched by the devotees and by the Bramins on one side, and on the other the ruler Raja Raja Chola, and his threeconsorts enjoying theperformance 
Ancient paintings also depict the dances in the dance halls, on the pillars, walls, and curtains.
Most of the research, dealing with dance, and the paintings begin with the Pallava period, in the Tamil history. Although the Pallava period reflected the continuations of earlier periods, there is no concrete evidence to support it. Mainly the paintings which have been studied date from the 7th century A.D. Among the Pallava kings, Mahendra Varman was called Tiger among the painters. Mahendra Varman s skill in painting was recognised according to a stone inscription. Mahendra Varman wrote a thesis on paintings called Thatchana Chithram.
Related dances 
In the famous Chithannal caves, during Mahendra Varmans reign, by his order, numerous paintings were painted. Paintings related to dance were painted on the walls. One of the most celebrated paintings is that of LORD NATARAJA, __ the cosmic dancer, at the entrance of the cave. And it is after seeing this painting that the saint Thirunavukarasa Nayanar sang what else is there to see!. The paintings, during the Pallava period, still appear in the Kanchi Kailasa Nathar temple, and Mamandur caves.
Following the Pallava period, the paintings received a boost. During the Chola period, in Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple, numerous paintings of dancers were painted on the walls and the roof.
One of the paintings depicts Lord Shiva seated on a tiger skin and watching a dance performance of the Apsaras. Another painting depicts, the cosmic dance of Lord Nataraja, watched by the devotees and by the Bramins on one side, and on the other the ruler Raja Raja Chola, and his three consorts enjoying the performance.
In most of these paintings, the expressions are very clear. Tragically the most famous paintings on the walls of the Thanjai Bragatheeswarar temple were damaged by a fire. But efforts were being made to resuscitate them.
Unlike sculptures and rock inscriptions, the paintings are likely to suffer damages and destructions, due to natural or man-made causes.

Pakistan pick five uncapped players for Ireland, England Tests
LAHORE, Sunday - Pakistan included five uncapped players in the 16-man squad announced Sunday for their Tests against Ireland and England starting next month, with an eye on the World Cup next year.
The five include openers Fakhar Zaman, 28, and Imam-ul-Haq, 22. Batsmen Usman Salahuddin and Saad Ali, and allrounder Faheem Ashraf are the other three uncapped members of the squad.
The World Cup next year is in England. So we've decided to call up several young players to give them exposure to those conditions, chief selector Inzamam-ul-Haq said at a press conference.
This is a great opportunity for us, particularly our batsmen, to gain experience in this conditions.
Pakistan suffered a major setback last week when ace leg-spinner Yasir Shah was ruled out of the tour with a hip bone fracture.
Shah was replaced with teenager Shadab Khan, who has only played one Test.
Yasir's absence is a big loss for us, Haq said.
If we look at his numbers for the last two years, he has more wickets than any other bowler for Pakistan. He was our strike bowler. He played a big part in all the games we won.
Haq said selectors had tried strengthen the side's batting, which was weakened after the retirement last year of Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan.
The 32-year-old batsman Fawad Alam failed to make the squad again despite his strong domestic form.

Righteous  men above law
A civilized society to maintain freedom, equality, justice and fairness within its territory, fundamental human rights, guarantee the dignity and well-being of all the people and the independence of the judiciary frames and puts in place with the moral consent of all its citizens, in common and for their good and well-being, a basic supreme law so that with other just and fair laws that flow from it, such a society could develop consistently and prosper for the common benefit of all. From immemorial times, law expressed the will of the people. In 1651, Thomas Hobbes the English philosopher stated that Law is the formal glue that holds fundamentally disorganised societies together.
Thus, civilized people have through civilized representatives of theirs have formulated such laws in as just and fair a manner as they could for the good functioning of society. Therefore the laws of the land are formulated so as to become the basic rules that govern and guide actions and relations among persons, organisations, as well as all relations vis--vis the governments.
Laws edict, mandate and command should make the demands of the law imperative on all, each appropriating what is his due and fulfilling what is obligatory of him. The overbearing authority of the just law specifies the rights, duties and obligations of citizens and their elected representatives and makes the law superior to all so that all are bound to obey the law. The law possesses an authority that is authentic and valid above and beyond the authority of any single individual.
The authority of the law is of such supreme importance that the Jewish people held that God himself is bound by the law he has given and that God does not act contrary to reason and the spirit of the law. Therefore a basic Law should not in written Constitutions be contradictory even in its nuances in any way, exempting anyone from obeying the law.
Corrupt politicians and administrators
Righteousness is the outcome of the comprehensive fulfilment of the law. Unfortunately just as past politicians made righteous society a political slogan, present-day ones have similarly adopted Yahapalanaya as their slogan. It is ironic that the UNP and SLFP that have governed this country separately and jointly, contrary to good governance, have done irreparable harm to the country by accommodating within their purview all kinds of corrupt politicians and administrators who directly undermined the short-term and long term well-being of the people and the independence and authority of those judges who with rectitude administered the law.
Clearly, history is littered with pseudo-leaders who, in spite of civilized laws accrued understanding over centuries, flouted the formulated law and the moral law, misled the people and ignored civilized behaviour and even degraded Constitutions to suit their fancies and triggered many a social injustice and caused immense harm, social chaos and even irretrievable ruin to nations and peoples.
People of many a society in the recent past lacked that uncanny intelligence and social understanding to detect and prevent the individuals who ride on to power on the temporary but tempestuous wave of popular support that disappears in the same way as it appears. This has happened in Sri Lanka just as it did in communist Russia and China and in fascist Germany and Italy among others.
It needs to be understood that above the law there could be no one, unless such a person acknowledges that he is governed by an ethico-moral law above himself to which he freely submits in such a transparent manner that all others too perceive that he does not consider himself divine or above the law or is akin to someone personifying the supremacy of the law.
No one therefore has the right to say I am the law except of course metaphorically when a chief justice or a head of government or state asserts thus to underline the justice of his stand in view of the common good and well-being of all the people without any partiality or discrimination. Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Mussolini among others, could never have so asserted; they committed much savagery and were heinously unjust to millions of their own people.
In Sri Lanka neither Mahinda Rajapaksa as Head of State nor Sarath N. Silva as Chief Justice could have been seen as transparently just and confident enough to say so, as they shamefully abused the system of justice, indulged in favouritism and made their whim and fancy the forcibly operative law bringing about a despicable state of corruption, unlawful disorder in public administration, in the legal system creating chaotic disorder in the country.
Thrown out of power
Despotic dictators or pseudo authoritarian figures dressed up in mock charismatic garb with the support of certain persons in the mass media, strive to present themselves as populist representatives of the people, when they are in fact ego absorbed individuals who disdain the law, manipulate and control people rather than act as servants of the common good.
In Sri Lanka, too prominent politicians have astutely manipulated the law to put on the garb of heroes and exceptional charismatics even when they were garbled with many a treacherous quality. Of course for the temporary period of their hold on power, they have their lackeys to sing paeans of adulation and praise and even render kingly idolization to them. Their imagination, however, does not run far and they cannot espy how despised they will be when they are thrown out of power.
The law is made to look asinine because the law is misused to deal with people in stupid ways: the law that is intended to deal justly and fairly with each and every citizen his due seems to get bent in warped ways freeing the wrong-doer and convicting the innocent or the innocent getting ignored while the wrongdoer is safeguarded or the most heinous of all, someone with political authority or a judge getting worked up and treating a seeker of justice in the most unjust manner. This has happened also in Sri Lanka and that is very evidently not justice.
People rise dissenting against it as evidenced in January 2015. It is not acceptable. Such should not only be not repeated, those who authored and dished out such patent injustice should be made accountable and debarred from responsible positions.
Is it the fault of the law or is it also due to the deviousness of those involved who selfishly thwart the purpose of the law If the law is formulated with lacunae it could always be improved upon in keeping with the original intention and reason for a particular law. Laws cannot mend, only restrain crooked hearts.
When laws are formulated they are circumspectly and intelligently formulated by knowledgeable people who include lawyers and other related experts, for the common good of all in society.
The broad purpose of every particular law would be evident from the circumstances and the parametres within which it is formulated even though formulations could always be improved upon by amending and focusing it more pointedly on matters it needs to cover and to uphold the justice and the just purpose for which it was intended.
The end purpose of the whole body of statutes in a country would be the well-being, security and sound health of the body politic by which the strong are bound to be just and the weak are assured security and all have confidence in the system of justice. Much needs to be done to bring this about in Sri Lanka.
Supremacy of the law
In Sri Lanka, there are those engaged in collusion to practically annul the law or not apply the law, suppress the law, weaken the law, sidetrack and deflect the law and do anything but uphold, respect and maintain the supremacy of the law. Many lawyers, even sitting in Parliaments, have not been decent professionals above corruption but exploited their privileged positions to accumulate wealth for themselves. They have been a great disappointment to the people.
Some of those who are supposed to be among the most successful and the best of lawyers are those who earn a lot of money often by getting the wrongdoer and the criminal off the hook.
They even resort to their own ruses to evade or get around the systematic application of the law on income taxes and in various criminal matters. Lawyers should ask themselves whether they are professionally upright when they try to justify and get off the hook patently unjust wrongdoers who have committed crimes of great magnitude. In any case, every serious injustice inflicted on the country is unacceptable and unpardonable.
A judge, on very reasonable and humanitarian grounds, might refrain from strictly applying the law in a particular case and it will seem indeed gracious and compassionate when there are grounds for correction and rehabilitation instead of instant punishment.
A normal marital union or a nuclear or extended family or neighbourhood community is the result of relationships which persist due to accepted norms of human conduct being respected by all. The most notable mark of a civilized people is their adherence to the longstanding ethico-moral norms of society. With education now made compulsory for all, a society with more civilized parliamentarians who obey the law, behave as decent adults and selflessly work for the countrys progress may indeed be achievable.
We need to strive to establish good inter-community relations, to form a united nation and recognize human dignity, mutual respect and honour, secure liberty, justice, ensure domestic peace and provide for the common good.
It is towards this end that a wholesome Constitution that upholds the dignity and rights of people needs to be adopted as the basic law of the land. Only leaders of honesty and integrity could succeed in such a project of establishing a country based on Law where a civilize and law-abiding people could flourish.

Season with a reason  to look  forward to
When Avurudu first arrived in this land, our ancestors were captivated by its good looks, ceremony and charm. But when that allure began to fade away over years, decades and centuries, and returns with unwelcome waves of commercialism and the like, our ancestors must have felt that the memories of their adolescence are gone forever.
Among all festive seasons of Sri Lanka, the Avurudu must be the one that is least capable of flying under the radar. Awash goes the countrys media apparatus with experts offering descriptions, mostly unoriginal, about the history and other aspects of the ceremony. Another school takes a different path to question and pass judgement on the ceremony for its increasing commercial faade. That school is a minority, constituted mostly by the youths. Questioning is admirable and sometimes looks quite an exceptional option.
But does questioning alone do justice Questioning the validity of Sinhala Tamil New Year, in a way, shows ignorance of the bigger picture. When we question, we indirectly think we are unconventional thinkers. This indirectly makes us happy. Before questioning, we must reflect the bigger picture.
Probably why the rest of us opt to tag along with the festive spirit: the Sinhala and Tamil New Year.
Like in any other community, the Sinhala Tamil New Year exists to unite people of different backgrounds and ideologies. A festival of such a category is essential for humankinds survival. Naturally, a man is pushed towards negative traits such as wrath and hatred. These traits continue to pervade most human relationships throughout the year. The festival has a potential to outweigh these negative traits by freshening and smoothening relationships.
The soaps have often shown how wrathful families finally make amends. The trend or customs may sound boring, as it rolls on every year without much difference. But the human race needs such festivities for its own survival. A day or two of friendship is much more worth than a whole year spent in wrath.
Amid all hardships, man would finally reap his harvest. That usually happens once a year. That certainly deserves celebration. Festivities are born to celebrate harvests. The New Year, despite whatever changes take place, may continue to grow. The festival depends on the usual routine of its followers. Sri Lanka's evolution of the New Year offers a good example.
Sri Lanka was preliminarily  and continues to be, to a lesser extent - an agricultural country. So the New Year customs were mostly based on agrarian society. But with the British arrival, the society experienced many upheavals. The New Year in the same vein faced a cultural change. Like anything, it too has to face evolution.
What is the better New Year No one has the right to judge. The New Year serves its purpose as the society wheels on with times. Many argue that the New Year has become a trader's festival  commercialised, more sophisticated in phrasing. Not only such phenomenon is inevitable, but it is also a part of the deal that is evolution.
The society's needs have grown far beyond more than it was a few decades ago. There are certain points where it exceeds beyond the tolerable level. The government had to increase taxes on cars, especially the best-selling Indian brands, as the traffic congestion was getting worse. When buying rate goes high, even beyond a tolerable point, it takes a toll on the whole social system. The rulers have to hold against such currents.
Evolution is what everything has to undergo. Festivals and ceremonies are no exceptions.
In times of yore, the custom was to drop a one-cent coin to the well. It bore many messages. The well used to be one source of income. The residents used water to vegetation as well as their own purpose. But things are different now. The well is becoming an antique item in the urbanity.
A well could be dug in the garden to keep up with the tradition. For some, this may be a joke. For some, this may be a good symbolic gesture to keep up with the tradition. For some, this may just be ridiculous. To dig the well or not, that is not the question. The question is if we should accept and come to terms with evolution.
With evolution, customs have to change. This metamorphosis has quite a few words: globalisation, modernization and urbanisation are beautiful words.
We had no other source of water. So we had to keep well in reverence. The well was an important element, hence it had related customs. Now with the pipelines flowing down beneath us, do we still have to adhere to that particular custom It doesn't mean we must cease respecting the ancient water systems. But we too have to move on.This is one example. When these customs cease, the questions and criticism emerge. The New Year is losing its glamour, some can easily opine. These opinions matter, and are relevant. The festivities may lose their glamour. But who can expect glamour to continue every year without any difference Seasons change. New discoveries unfold.
If these come to pass, how can only the festivities remain undisturbed The New Year has truly become the trader festival, one may say, as they are the category most benefited by the occasion. Saying so doesn't mean we must reverse the situation. We simply cannot do that. We cannot reverse the grown-up human necessities. Our era is technologically advanced. But that does not matter.
Many doubts have started surfacing.
This is merely one period we are passing. Many more things have occurred, and are about to occur. With many arguments and questions drifting through, what is left for us is to keep up with the tradition that evolves with time.
As we roam among a techno-savvy crowd, the real Avurudu is gradually becoming a vintage festival. Ergo, in a centurys time, this very same Avurudu might not be able to retain the civil eminence it is privileged with now.
It will be left inscribed in the vulnerable sands of history as a good old antique festival.

Ceremonial sitting of Parliament on May 8
SLFP-UNP to sign new MoU
The SLFP and the UNP will sign a new Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to work together in the Government following the ongoing talks, SLFP General Secretary and Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the two ministerial groups presently engaged in discussions would come up with a common programme for the two parties to govern together for the remainder of 18 months.
The new programme will get off the ground with a ceremonial sitting in Parliament on May 8.
It will be a comprehensive and strong programme acceptable and beneficial to the country.
The details are now being worked out and the SLFP has appointed a five-member committee headed by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama for the purpose. Once finalised the two parties will endorse it as an MoU, he said.
He also said the ministry subjects would be revised in a rationale manner during the upcoming Cabinet reshuffle.
In the meantime, Speakers Media Secretary Chaminda Gamage confirmed that the second session of eighth Parliament on May 8 would be a ceremonial sitting. President Maithripala Sirisena is expected to commence the session with a special statement.
Deputy Secretary General and Chief of Staff of Parliament Neil Iddawala said the Constitutional Assembly and Steering Committee appointed to deliberate on Constitutional reforms are not affected by the prorogation of Parliament as they were set up by Parliamentary resolutions.
All the other Parliament Committees except for Sectoral Oversight Committees and the High Post Committee stand dissolved following the prorogation. Members and chairmen to them must be re-appointed. This applies to the COPE and COPA as well.
All the private member motions, private member bills and questions for oral answers have to be re-presented. Propagation will not affect the other Bills presented by the Government and those will continue to the next session.
Parliamentary seats of MPs will also change as 15 SLFP ministers, deputy and state ministers have resigned from their posts, he said.
Asked whether a new Deputy Speaker will be appointed on May 8, Iddawala said Parliament is yet to officially receive the resignation letter of Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.
