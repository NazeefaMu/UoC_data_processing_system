TEA welcomes removal of ban on glyphosate
The Tea Exporters Association (TEA) yesterday welcomed the government's decision to lift the ban on use of glyphosate weedicide on tea and rubber plantations, the Association said yesterday.
The Association thanked the President and the Prime Minister for the decision taken in the best interest of plantation sector and also the National Economy.
The Association itself addressed a letter to the President in February this year requesting his intervention to remove the ban as it had caused an adverse impact on the tea exports sector with crop losses reported in high and medium elevations in the last two years and also the cropping up of MRL issue in Japan and some EU countries from the beginning of this year.
All leading tea producing countries namely India, Kenya, China, Vietnam use glyphosate as it is the most cost effective weedicide for the tea industry. The use of glyphosate is accepted in every tea importing country including EU, USA and Japan. Recently the EU Commission approved the use of glyphosate in EU countries for a further five year period from 2017. This is clear evidence that the use of glyphosate is accepted in many countries as a safe weedicide.
The tea crop losses in the high and medium elevations have been estimated at around 20-25 % of the annual tea production with the ban on glyphosate and subsequent low application of fertilizer. The estimated export revenue losses at the prevailing prices is in the region of Rs. 18 to 20 billion a year. Further, non-availability of adequate quantities of Ceylon Tea for exports allows other tea producing countries to make inroads in to Ceylon Tea market share in some importing countries.
TEA also thanked the Plantation Industries Minister and Dr. Rohan Pethiyagoda, former Chairman of Tea Board for their efforts in getting the glyphosate ban lifted for the plantation sector.
"We are hopeful that tea industry would be able to overcome the crop issues and MRL matter with tea importing countries in the next 3 to 4 months allowing uninterrupted tea exports from the country," the release said.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND-UP:
Trinity host Royal in the Bradby 2nd leg
The confrontation between the two senior rugby playing schools - Trinity College and Royal College for school rugby's richest prize - the Bradby Shield will take place at the Palekelle grounds today. This school game is the much looked forward to encounter every year and from it develops some of the best and lasting friendships. This game produces rugby of a very high standard which thousands of rugby fans come a long way to see and enjoy. This year in their 1st leg played in Colombo on April 21 Royal had the golden opportunity to get the first victory under Sabith Ferozs leadership against Trinity College led by Avishka Shiek 39-7. However recent history is very much on Royals side. They have now gone five games unbeaten and Trinity will be eager to avoid a whitewash in the 2nd leg, In the 1st leg Royal put the Trinity XV under serious pressure at numerous stages throughout the game and they showed plenty of heart and X-factor on attack.
Royals attack and defence was excellent. In todays game Trinity need to improve on everything that they failed to put right in the last outing. Trinity should continue to defend well, for the full 70 minutes, convert their kicks at goal and ensure they continue their fine attacking form, they need to cut out the errors they make to complement their bravery in attack.
They must continue to dominate set pieces and be clinical when point-scoring opportunities present themselves. This season, though Trinity has a good side, they have failed to show their prowess. Royal has shown improvement this year and on present form should win today as well. Hopefully if Trinity can win today they can get some confidence for the second round matches.
Trinity College Squad: Avishka Shiek (C), Akitha Sakalasooriya, Warren Weerakoon, Reshan Bandaranayake, Amith Kulatunge, Vishwa Ranaraja, Chalintha Nandisena, Yomal Bandara, D.

C.E. Simithrachchi trophy
One hour before the Bradby will be the Trinity under 18 encounter at Pallekelle grounds; this will be their return encounter for the C.E. Simithrachchi trophy.
The match will commence at 3 pm. In the first game played in Colombo, in a nail biting game Royal ended up as winners by scoring 14 points to 8.
The winner of the trophy will be decided on the aggregate of points scored in the two games. Trinity is led by Menidu Jayasinghe and are packed with some top young up and coming players. Royal are led by Migara Mithishanka and have some fine young players.
Ruggerite Ravi Bandaranayake Chief Guest
Trinity College captain of 1981 Ravi Bandaranayake will grace the Bradby game today as the chief guest. He won the Lion in 1981 along with T.R. Panabokke, L.S. Pilapitiya. B.S.S. Fernando, R.S. Ratwatte, and P. Adihetty. In 1981 Trinity under his captaincy scored a resounding 16-3 win in the 1st leg at Nittawela with wingers Ananda Wickremasinghe and Nihal Gunawardena scoring two spectacular tries which came off classic three quarter moves.
The third try was scored by flanker Kumar Bulathsinhalage who booted a loose ball and fell on it in the in-goal area. In the return match at Longden Place the Royalists staged a superb-fight-back helped by two fine tries by skipper Sujeewa Cooray and Dushantha Kumar to triumph by 10 points to 3 but could not prevent Trinity from regaining the Bradby Shield after four years.
Cup 2nd round
In Division IA, from Kandy only Kingswood and Trinity have qualified for the Cup Championship. Kingswood will play their first game on May 12 with Isipathana College scheduled to play at Bogambara Stadium if the ground is fit.
Their next game is with St. Peters that too in Kandy with date not fixed most probably it will be on April 20.
FFSL meets KAFL
Three officials of the Football Federation had visited Kandy last Saturday, and had a meeting in a hotel along Dalada Veediya. They have met some of the members of the clubs in Kandy.
At the meeting they have decided to have the AGM of the league which was not held in 2017. For the last two years no inter club tournaments have been conducted.
Inter Police Athletics
Plans are afoot over here in the hills, to organize an athletics meets among the Central Province Police division.
The idea has come from the IGP Pujitha Jayasundara. The participating athletes will be from the divisions of Kandy, Hatton, Gampola, Matale and Nuwara Eliya. The problem here is there is no proper ground to hold the meet as Bogambara is the only grounds with athletics facilities, but it is not available.
Rajans, Antonians fail to win a single game
Dharmaraja College and St. Anthonys College missed their chance to qualify for the 2018 inter school rugby second round Cup competition both falling to win a single game in the first round outings.
The Old boys who give a big hand are deeply disappointed. Both schools were coached by two experienced coaches, who gave their best but the players failed to deliver. .
Where is volleyball today in Kandy
The game of volleyball is the national sport of Sri Lanka. In a certain era volleyball was a popular game in Kandy, but today sadly the much needed support for the game is missing. If the proper backing is there, this game too, could be making big news.
The first volleyball league was formed in Kandy in 1941. At one time there were tournaments held annually. Today it is not so, volleyball in Kandy needs a fillip. The game was introduced to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) in 1916 by R. W. Camack.
Kandy Schools interested in Indoor Hockey
Kandy schools boys and girls who are doing well at hockey are keen to take up indoor hockey.
It will be ideal if Kandy schools too are given a break to take up to this sport at indoor level. Initially they need to organize a workshop for the schools. Kandy Schools are keen to get to know the rules and regulations of the game.
Weight lifting to come back
Weightlifting is one of the oldest sports which held sway in Kandy that produced several sportsmen who brought honor to their clubs, themselves and the country.
This is one of the prominent sports that could bring international fame to Sri Lanka if it is well supported.
The sport in Kandy prospered largely due to the immense support and helping hand extended by the Kandy YMCA who were backed by the National Olympic Committee and Sports Ministry. Once again it is refreshing to note, weightlifting is catching up in a big way in schools. Even girls are interested in taking to this sport for recognition.
Vidyartha Old boy Dilum makes Kandy proud
Old boy of Vidyartha College 21 year old Dilum Deeshana, a top rugger player made Kandy, his school and parents proud by refereeing the cup final of the Midnight 10 rugby tournament held in Singapore on April 27 at Turf Club grounds. The Cup final was between Borneo Eagle and Legiste, which was won by Borneo Eagles 22-0. Dilum played for Vidyartha College in 2016.
Kandy with a good set of cricketers
Kandy are blessed with a fine set of cricketers to play in the super provincial one day tournament. They played their first match on 2 May vs. Galle at P Sara Oval and won by 28 runs according to D/L system. Yesterday they played Dambulla at P. Sara Oval. On 11 May they play Galle at CCC, 14 May vs Colombo at Premadasa Stadium. The side is led by Angelo Mathews and also includes Trinity captain Hasitha Boyagoda.

Nipuna won the under 15 and 17 singles, Malith won the under 19 singles and doubles. A big hand should go to the Managing Director of the Mahaweli Reach Hotel Jayantha Panabokke for giving his fullest support to make this tournament a grand one.

Lakshani Samarkoon
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday ordered to further remand two Chinese nationals until May 9 on charges under Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
The Magistrate refused to grant bail to the suspects and ordered Presidents Counsel Jayantha Weerasinghe appearing for the suspects to submit the relevant documents including documents of their residences.
The suspects had allegedly kept passports of eight other persons in their possession. They were also charged for preparing forged documents to stay in Sri Lanka.

World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day on May 8
On World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day, which falls on May 8, the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) will be joining a global celebration of the work and bravery of Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers, and the diverse humanitarian services they offer in communities everywhere.
Our volunteers live in the communities they support, from the smallest and most remote villages to the largest cities, said Jagath Abeysinghe, President of the SLRCS.
Our services are tailored for local needs and are delivered in local languages. Today is when the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement come together to thank our volunteers who give their time and expertise here in Sri Lanka and all over the world.
The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society reaches nearly 300, 000 people every year with a range of services tailored to local needs. From disaster management, post flood and recovery assistance, community based health activities, dengue prevention, first aid and restoring family links to the promotion of Humanitarian Values and Principles, it helps people to prepare for, cope with, and recover from crises.
Every year around the world, the Movement supports many millions of people affected by conflict, natural disasters and other emergencies, through its network of around 14 million volunteers and 450,000 staff.
Red Cross and Red Crescent volunteers are as diverse as the life-saving services they provide through 190 National Societies, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). This local action is supported by the global reach of IFRC, ICRC, as well as partnerships with sister National Societies across the world.
Around the world, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement reaches out to the most vulnerable in all types of contexts - from responding to needs in disaster and conflict situations, to providing assistance in urban centres and remote areas, and advocating on behalf of those in need in policy circles and to governments, said Claire Meytraud, head of the ICRC in Sri Lanka. But our approach is universal, guided at every turn by our Fundamental Principles: Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity and Universality
Gerhard Tauscher, the IFRC representative in Sri Lanka said: whatever you are living through - a natural disaster, a health crisis, the effects of conflict or violence - we are here to support you.
World Red Cross and Red Crescent Day is celebrated every May 8 - the birth date of the Movements founder Henry Dunant. It recognizes the bravery and dedication of volunteers and staff members around the world. 2018 is the 190th anniversary of Dunants birth, mirroring the 190 National Societies providing humanitarian support in communities large and small every day.

Semenya athletics testosterone drama angers S.Africa
Johannesburg, Thursday: Anger is mounting in South Africa over new athletics rules prescribing maximum testosterone levels in female competitors widely seen as targeting the countrys Olympic champion Caster Semenya.
Her backers at home and abroad have denounced the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) new policies that target women who naturally produce unusually high levels of testosterone of being sexist, racist, homophobic, dehumanising and humiliating.
From November 1, athletes classified as hyper-androginous will have to chemically lower their testosterone levels to just 5 nanomoles per litre of blood to be eligible to run any international race of 400 metres up to the mile. The IAAF has defended the rule change as scientifically sound.
According to a study financed by the IAAF, high testosterone levels in some athletes gives them a significant advantage in certain competitions.
The first athlete to be affected by the change is double Olympic 800 metres champion Semenya -- who also runs the 1,500 metres.
The IAAF insists that the new rules are about levelling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition in the sport.
The regulations are solely to ensure fair and meaningful competition within the female classification for the benefit of the broad class of female athletes, said the IAAF in a statement.
But the decision has provoked an explosion of anger.
South African law professor Steve Cornelius described it as ostracising certain individuals, all of them female, for no reason other than being what they were born to be in a stinging letter resigning from the IAAFs disciplinary tribunal.
I cannot in good conscience continue to associate myself with an organisation which insists on... female classification (that) is based on the same kind of ideology that has led to some of the worst injustices and atrocities, he wrote to IAAF president Sebastian Coe.
South African sprinter L.J. van Zyl told AFP that the decision was unfair because there are only certain events that are targeted.
Canadian Olympic wrestler Erica Wiebe tweeted that I believe in #fairsport, #cleansport and #sportsocialchange but I dont believe in policing womens participation in sport because they dont fit within Western conventions of femininity. Cmon IAAF. AFP

## Title: Mohamed Salah Hes like the Sphinx and the Pyramids
## Supertitle:

Mohamed Salah Hes like the Sphinx and the Pyramids
CAIRO - Hamdi Noor likes to tell stories.
Sitting inside his Cairo home, the former soccer coach begins to share one of his favorite tales. This particular story, he says, involves a phone call.
Sir, how are you How are you, captain said the man on the other end of the phone.
Who are you, my son Noor asked. Its Mohamed Salah, said the man.
The very, very famous international player Noor inquired.
Captain Hamdi, dont call me that. You are my captain and my coach and I owe you a lot, Noor quotes Salahs bashful response.
Noor could spend all day talking about Salah, as could most Egyptians.
Pass a few minutes in Noors company and its clear that Salahs exploits in Englands Premier League have transcended sports. His achievements belong to all Egypt.
Since arriving at Liverpool at the start of the Premier League season for a then-club record $49 million, he has scored 43 goals and helped fire Liverpool into its first Champions League final in a decade. Thats on top of leading Egypt to this summers World Cup -- its first in 30 years. When fans in Egypt watch Liverpool you hear them shouting from all the homes in Egypt, Noor says.
This is Gods love for him (Salah) and the impact of peoples prayers for him which have done so much.
No shortage of superlatives have already been written about the 25-year-old, who is now being mentioned in the same breath as Barcelonas Lionel Messi and Real Madrids Cristiano Ronaldo.
He has already been named as Africas top footballer, Players Player of the Year by his colleagues in the Premier League, and Player of the Year by the Football Writers Association. But speak to anyone who knows Salah well, or has spent time with the worlds most talked about footballer, and they will all describe him in the same way -- humble.
Few know Salah better than Noor, the man whom the Liverpool player refers to as his second father and credits for much of his development.
Noor was Salahs coach in his formative years, the man who helped a 12-year-old boy from the rural village of Nagrig in the Nile Delta become one of Egypts most beloved treasures.
He recalls a small boy who would travel up to eight to 10 hours a day, sometimes taking five buses on his way to train with the El Mokawloon club in the Nasr City district of Cairo.
In the end, such was Salahs determination to succeed, and the clubs desperation to keep hold of him, that he moved into a local hotel to train with the junior side.
It was a decision that Noor says allowed Salah to grow up quickly, living away from his family and training twice a day.
Mohamed might have been different from other Egyptian professional footballers, Noor said. He figured out his path and he adapted to professional work. He adapted to it because between the ages of 12 and 15 years old he resided in a hotel where hed wake up and come down to the field.
Early on, he figured out the fundamentals of professionalism.
That professionalism meant Salah was always striving to improve and able to adapt whatever the environment.
Noor speaks of a boy who was always keen to seek advice from his coaches, who would listen attentively to those who sought to help develop his career.
All the coaches who worked with Mohamed say he is very polite, religious, does a lot of good. All of this helped him reach the stardom he has now.
He is very charitable, very moral, isnt tied to referees or fans. He just sees the goal, hes always focused.
WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
Nowhere is Salahs charitable nature more evident than in his hometown
Nagrig, a rural farming village around three hours from Cairo.
On the playing fields in Nagrig, children take it in turns to reenact Salahs latest efforts on the field their hero helped build.
His heart clearly remains here. He returns each year, often spending time with families, shaking hands and talking to those who dream of emulating his achievements.
But his charitable nature does not come just through words. Salah has paid for a new football field to be set up as well as a youth center, hospital and school.
Hes made our country proud and happy, local resident Abdul Rahman told
CNN.
Everyone says to us: Oh youre from the stars hometown. I say yes and get a little shy when they ask for a picture with me.
His friend, rather aptly also named Mohamad Salah, says his namesake always takes time out to speak with local residents.
When he comes here, we meet him very casually, the younger Salah says.
Sometimes we even knock on his door and he comes out. Were proud of him.
ON THE STREETS
Those in Nagrig are not the only Egyptians to be proud of Salah.
At a caf in the Nasr City district of Cairo, all eyes are turned towards the big screen in the courtyard. As the smoke from the shisha pipes slowly rises into the night sky and coffee cups begin to empty, those watching subconsciously shuffle forward in their seats.
They are here for one reason -- Salah. Liverpool had won the first game of its Champions League quarterfinal against Manchester City 3-0 but was trailing 1-0 in the return match.
Home team City, by now well on its way to becoming Premier League champion, appeared capable of further closing the gap.
But with 11 minutes of the second half played, Salah struck, calmly finishing off with an impudent flick over the goalkeeper.
Cue bedlam -- not just among the Liverpool supporters in Manchester, but across Egypt.
LANDMARK
All over the world, people are looking at Egypt in a new light because of Mohamed Salah, Ali Ahmad tells CNN.
Everyone knows that Salah is a very good player and they think hes now a landmark for Egypt like the Pyramids or the Sphinx.
Salahs success and popularity transcend sports. So much so that he won thousands of write-in votes in Marchs presidential election.
His 95th-minute penalty that earned Egypt victory over the Democratic Republic of Congo and secured Egypts place at the World Cup fo the first time since 1990 sparked scenes of wild celebrations throughout the country.
So its little surprise that if you take a walk past any newsstand in Cairo youll see Salahs face plastered across newspapers and magazines. On the streets, his face adorns wall after wall, a reminder of his status as Egypts ambassador to the world.
Salahs now a guide for a lot of the young people who are learning from him -- hes given them a lot of motivation, one fan watching the game tells CNN.
Hes doing advertising about stopping drugs and smoking for youth in Egypt, so its perfect.
Hes doing a very good job on the pitch as well in society.
Salahs feat of transcending football has been as improbable as it has been remarkable.
His antidrug campaigning and his funding of schools and hospitals in his home village have endeared him further to a general public that already adored him.
Those who know him well or spend time in his company speak of a man who is grounded and driven by a sense of responsibility and ambition.
He gives a good impression about Muslims, about Arabs. Hes a perfect player, another fan, Amro Mostafa, tells CNN.
Hes a good role model for Egyptians and even abroad. Hes charitable here and in the UK. Hes a helpful man.
ANGEL OF THE NILE
The next chapter of Salahs story will be written in Kiev on Saturday May 26..
Liverpool, leading 5-2 from the semifinal first leg, were beaten 4-2 in Rome by Salahs former employer AS Roma, but survived to go through 7-6 on aggregate and set up a final clash with 12-time winner Real Madrid..
Noor will be watching, of course. He will be hoping to see Salahs improbable journey take another step toward the unexpected and breathe further life into the countrys love affair with their prodigal son.
Hes a symbol, Noor says. Hes a phenomenon. This phenomenon is bound to be taught to others. We must know what to do for someone who has this talent to make it shine.
While Noors love and admiration for Salah is obvious, there is one area of contention -- the nickname The Egyptian King bestowed upon the player by Liverpool supporters and the British media. Noor is not a fan of the moniker, and prefers his own nickname for Salah. He is not a Pharaoh, Noor says. Hes an angel -- The Angel of the Nile. I like to call him that.
King or angel, there is nobody more loved than Mohamad Salah in Egypt.

Rs. 10m spent annually on each Thalassemia parient
Nadira Gunatilleke
Around 100 thalassemia children are born in Sri Lanka annually and the Government annually spends Rs. 10 million on one thalassemia patient, Non Communicable Diseases Unit Director Dr. Thilak Siriwardana said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Health Promotion Bureau (HPB) in Colombo yesterday. Dr. Siriwardana said the country reportedly has about 2,000 thalassemia patients. Some of them could be cured by transplanting bone marrow. One such operation costs the Government Rs.15 million. The disease has affected the most the North Western (Wayamba), North Central, Central and Uva Provinces. Therefore, couples who expect to get married must undergo the test for thalassemia gene, he said.
HPB Director Dr. Paba Palihawadana said an abnormal gene of parents and children causes thalassemia. Thalassemia patients need medical treatment and blood transfusion for the rest of their lives. About four percent of the Sri Lankan population have the abnormal gene in them, she said.

2018: Nobel Literature Prize postponed
SWEDEN: The Swedish Academy said Friday it would postpone this year's Nobel Literature Prize for the first time in almost 70 years, as it is rocked by turmoil over links to a man accused of rape and sexual assault.
The Swedish Academy intends to decide on and announce the Nobel Prize in Literature for 2018 in parallel with the naming of the 2019 laureate, it said. The institution, founded in 1786, has on seven previous occasions chosen to reserve the prize: in 1915, 1919, 1925, 1926, 1927, 1936 and 1949.
On five of those occasions, the prize was delayed then awarded at the same time as the following year's prize, the Academy said in a statement. The body has been plunged in crisis since November, in the wake of the global #MeToo campaign, when Swedish newspaper of reference Dagens Nyheter published the testimonies of 18 women claiming to have been raped, sexually assaulted or harassed by Jean-Claude Arnault, an influential figure on the Swedish culture scene.
Arnault, the French husband of Academy member and poet Katarina Frostenson, has denied the allegations. The revelations have sowed discord among the Academy's 18 members about how to move forward, and in recent weeks, six of them have chosen to resign, including permanent secretary Sara Danius. The active members of the Swedish Academy are of course fully aware that the present crisis of confidence places high demands on a long-term and robust work for change, the Academy's interim permanent secretary Anders Olsson said in the statement.
We find it necessary to commit time to recovering public confidence in the Academy before the next laureate can be announced, he said.

Cargills reaches out to pumpkin farmers
The Cargills company, with the assistance of the Nawagattegama District Secretariat and the Puttalam District Samurdi Directorate, has begun to purchase pumpkins from farmers in the Navagattegama, Konkadalwala and Gaminipura areas.
Farmers in the areas have harvested pumpkins valued at more than Rs. 10 million and are unable to market them, until Cargills stepped forward to assist them, according to a press release issued by Cargills.
The farmers, who chose to grow pumpkins since there wasnt sufficient water for paddy cultivation, found themselves in a predicament when they couldnt sell a kilo of pumpkin for even Rs. 7 or 8.
Our harvest of pumpkins was going to rot. Because our plight was in the news, the Cargills company contacted us through the Puttalam District Samurdi Director General and the District Secretary. Now we see Cargills coming into our villages and purchasing our harvest, a farmer said.
She added: We grew pumpkins so we could enjoy a great new year. However, pumpkins began to rot here and there. There was no way to sell our harvest. We are happy that we are now able to sell our produce.
Cargills company officials said that Cargills is doing a social service. I think everyone knows about the problems concerning pumpkins. We learned about this from a news text. We arrived here to help the community. About two weeks ago, a similar situation arose with farmers who grew tomatoes in the Nawula area and the Matara area.
"We reached out to them as well. Weve made arrangements to purchase pumpkins and make them available to consumers. Cargills is engaged in distributing surplus pumpkins the company purchased to consumers. Every consumer who shops for more than Rs. 750 at Cargills Food City is offered 500 grams of pumpkin free of charge.
"Through this initiative, Cargills reconfirms its commitment to supporting farmers and farming communities as well as consumers, Cargills officials said.

Coal, not ADBs preferred option
Senior Energy Specialists of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday underlined that coal is not the ADBs preferred option for future energy requirements.
ADB Regional Sustainable Development Department Technical Advisor (Energy) Dr. Yongping Zhai, responding to a question on a suitable energy mix for Sri Lanka, said the ADB encourages renewable energy, potential import of LNG and regional cooperation with India to meet the energy requirements of the country.
Zhai was speaking at a press briefing at the 51st ADB Board of Governors Annual Meeting in Manila yesterday along with Senior Energy Specialist David Elzinga.
He said ADB is financing a wind farm and the hydro power plant in Sri Lanka to support renewable energy.
He however stressed any solution to the controversy on energy mix should come from within the country.
Zhai pointed out that debate on coal to meet future energy requirements is not only limited to Sri Lanka, but common to Asia and the rest of the world. He brought out a few points that Sri Lanka may consider when deciding whether it opts for more coal power plants.
Sri Lanka may have to ponder whether the any additional coal would derail Sri Lankas commitments under the Paris Agreement. It has to take into account whether the coal would affect the air quality as many countries with coal power have polluted air. See whether people are ready to risk that kind of living condition he said.
At the same time, optimal operational performance matter for Sri Lanka to supply power round the clock. It needs to have some stable base load power. Depending on these, coal may be an option but we in ADB believe renewable energy should be considered first and also potential import of gas may be another option. ADB should work together with the Government authorities and CEB and see how best we can meet this requirement. All options should be open. The country has to come with a forward looking energy mix, Zhai added.
Zhai He commended Sri Lankas achievements in the energy sector pointing out that it is a lot and ahead of many of its neighbouring countries in terms of access to electricity.
He also emphasised the need for a pricing system in Sri Lanka if these different types of energy to work. For example an investor willing to put up a wind farm must get an adequate tariff to ensure that investment is profitable. Regulatory framework is also important, he added.
He also said the ADB is willing to support Waste to Energy projects in the region, adding that the upcoming Clean Energy Forum in Manila will a good opportunity for Sri Lanka in this regard.

Giant steps towards reconciliation in Korea
Decried as a reclusive leader and ridiculed as a madman by the Western media and its acolyte media sources in the Third World, the leader of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea Kim Jong Un proved smarter than his adversaries thought.
Unmoved by criticism and slander, often mincing no words in denouncing US imperialism and its allies, Kim Jong pursued his own strategic goal of achieving nuclear deterrence often going to the brink of war but never resorting to war. Thus in a hostile international climate in which country after country, especially in West Asia and Africa succumbed to US aggression and collapsed, North Korea struggled to exist albeit with much sacrifices and even UN facilitated sanctions. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on April 27.
The two leaders agreed to pursue complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and set a years deadline for the conclusion of a peace treaty. The two countries are technically at war since the Armistice at the end of the Korean War. The Panmunjom Declaration issued jointly by the two Heads of State confirmed the common good of realizing, through complete denuclearization, a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula and carry out their respective roles and responsibilities in this regard.
Several minor yet important measures were also contemplated. Already both countries have dismantled the public hostile broadcast systems that were in operation in the DMZ. The DMZ is to be converted into a Zone of Peace. There will be regular meetings between the military commanders of the two sides. A hot line has been established connecting the two Presidents. Another Summit between the two leaders is being planned and it is expected to be held in Pyongyang by December 2018. North Korea has halted its missile development and nuclear test programme and joint military exercises by the US and South Korea also stands suspended. However, there is no mention of the fate of 28,000 strong US military contingents in South Korea. The development of the peace process would make their presence redundant and the dismantling of US bases a necessity.
Internationally these developments have received positive evaluation (except for few skeptics, mostly in the US, Japan and Israel) and Presidents Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un are expected to meet in May or June, probably in the DMZ. Of special significance is the support and security provided to North Korea by China and Russia throughout. Peace in the Pacific Ocean area and especially in the areas around the seas of Japan and China is very vital to contain the ever more aggressive incursion of the United Sates in the region, which has declared the Pacific Ocean as its most strategic zone of action.
North Korea has strengthened its relations with China recently, Kim Jong Un himself travelling there few weeks ago. This relationship is a vital existential one for both countries.
Japan in the vortex of North East Asian politics and having its own historical problems with both Koreas is naturally sensitive to these developments. A tripartite Summit of Japan, China and China attended by Premier Shinzo Abe, President Moon Jae and Premier Li Keqiang is scheduled for May 9.
Asian giants meet
The Korean summit has taken the glare out of the summit of India and China that was held recently in Wuhan, China. The two Asian giants decided to strengthen their relations. Chinese President Xi Jinping in a statement said, China and India are both important engines for global growth and we are central pillars for promoting a multi-polar and globalized world. A good China-India relationship is an important and positive factor for maintaining peace and stability in the world.
Modi said that as India and China represented 40 percent of the worlds population, they needed to try to work together to tackle global problems.
Stressing the importance of world peace, Modi said both nations have to make all possible contributions.
The two leaders have decided to issue strategic guidelines to their militaries to strengthen communications so as to avoid unfortunate incidents like the Doklam clash last year.
India and China share a 3500 km border, much in the deserted and snow-clad Himalayas. There is no Actual Line of Control (ALC) and the border is disputed in several places.
The two countries also agreed to implement a project jointly in Afghanistan.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has invited Chinese President Xi Jinping to visit India in 2019.
The improvement of relations between the two countries will have a salutary effect on peace in Asia, especially in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. A clash of the two giants, on the other hand, will seriously affect littoral states in the region including Sri Lanka in particular. Actually improvement of the relations between the two Asian giants will directly improve the prospects of development in Sri Lanka.

HBOs first televised female boxing match breaking the last barrier
In HBOs 45-year history, the network has never aired a female boxing match -- but that is soon to change. Punching her way into the history books on Saturday will be undisputed welterweight champion Cecilia Braekhus.
Braekhus - nicknamed boxings First Lady - will be defending her IBF-WBA-WBC-WBO titles at Californias StubHub Center against former middleweight champion Kali Reis on the undercard of Gennady Golovkin vs. Vanes Martirosyan.
Its a really big deal and Im trying not to let that get to me but, of course, you are representing a lot, the 34-year-old told CNN World Sport. There are a lot of female fighters out there, it will be emotional for a lot of people. It will be a big celebration.
Of course, I want to crown it all with a huge win... Hopefully a knockout, she added.
This was the last barrier and this will open up for more females to fight on HBO in the future. My experience is that someone needs to break down that door and the rest will happen itself.
This is not only a boxing match. This is so much more. Im wishing so much that well see a lot more female fights in the future on HBO. But the undefeated Norwegian, widely considered the worlds best pound-for-pound female boxer, finds the pressure to maintain her titles even more intense.
Climbing to the top, thats the easiest part. The hardest part is staying at the top, said Braekhus, her sports only undisputed world champio I feel all the hungry girls coming up, they are training and they want to take it all. They want all the belts, all the glory and Im just hanging in there.
FORCED TO LEAVE HOME
The Colombian-born Braekhus began kickboxing at the age of 13 and would jump out the window of her parents fourth-floor home to attend training.
In 1981, the year Braekhus was born, Norway banned professional boxing. If fighters were caught violating the Knockout Law they faced up to three months in jail. Braekhus left her adopted home for Germany and became a record-breaking champion, even though she could not compete or train on home soil.
I had to move abroad, and if I was to go back and do my fights in Norway I would actually be jailed. It was a very crazy situation, Braekhus remembered.
At the age of 21, she won both the world and European amateur kickboxing titles, establishing herself as a star.
Its been a challenge to be a woman in this sport. Also it was hard for all the years when I was not allowed to box in Norway. That was pretty sad because I was excluded from a lot of things. I actually felt my sport was criminalized, and its not a good feeling, she said.
It took some time, but I was slowly getting from this girl who wanted to box to being a fighter and one of the group.

I am ready to take on any challenge - Minister Fonseka
Minister Sarath Fonseka who took over the reins of the Ministry of Wildlife and Sustainable Development this week said he would not yield to political pressure when it came to wildlife policies.
This is not a ministry that is popular. You only hear of it when an elephant dies. But since I took it over, I have been getting numerous phone calls about it. Some say I will mess it up whilst others say I might shake things up, said Fonseka addressing a media briefing at the Ministry of Regional Development yesterday.
The former Army Commander determined to take on the challenge of protecting the natural assets of the country noted that some decisions he would make would not be popular, but then again he was not known for making popular decisions.
The Minister observed that Sri Lanka had a history of people living in close harmony with nature and thus it was not a hard subject to grasp,
The bigger challenge is to make the right decisions without letting politics interfere. I will do the right thing so no one can interfere.
The human-elephant conflict he said would take first place in his list of priorities for the ministry and in during his short tenor of the next 19 months, he said he would lay the foundation on how best to protect wildlife while also taking into account the livelihoods of those affected.
I have noticed that a lot of wrong doings are going on here. Especially when it comes to national parks. They have become dangerous places for animals. Yala has turned into a party place, I will ban alcohol within the park if I have to. If people want to go drink and party, we can arrange a separate place for that.
Fonseka observed that he would have to learn on the job given the limited time, but asked that the people not expect drastic change to take place in the country just because a Cabinet reshuffle took place.
It is the same politicians with the same weaknesses that have been moved around.
He explained that if people wanted change, they would have to change the political culture of the country and that in the last three years, if nothing had changed, the people too would have to take responsibility for that, You cant expect change when you are voting for the same people.

Kataragama pilgrims harassed by touts
Pilgrims who arrive at a place called Kada Hathaliha in the Kataragama town to buy fruits as offerings to Kataragama Maha Devalaya are harassed by the touts and brokers of pooja watti vendors, pilgrims complain.
The traders conduct their business at a car park in front of the CTB pilgrims rest. There are 40 pooja watti shops out of which 30 shop owners engage in the pooja watti business.
The brokers and touts in the car park force pilgrims to buy fruit from their shops. If pilgrims did not buy from them, the brokers accuse the pilgrims in foul language, sometimes attack them and do not allow vehicles to park in front of their shops. If pilgrims do park ignoring them, they vandalize the vehicle after the pilgrims go to worship the Maha Devalaya and Kirivehera.
Kataragama Lake House Newspaper Agent K. M. Ariyasena said these thugs sometimes do not allow persons to park their bicycles and motorcycles in front of his agency to buy papers. They push aside their bicycles after threatening them.
An official of the Kataragama Urban Development Authority said they constructed the car park and shops, and handed them over to the Kataragama Pradeshiya Saba who had rented out the car park to an individual.
Although the individual charges fees from vehicles, neither he nor the Pradeshiya Saba takes responsibility for vandalism.
Meanwhile, Kataragama Police Chief Inspector O.I.C. Upali Kariyawasam said he had received many complaints regarding this matter and that he had stationed two police constables in the location.

Lasitha 'Bonsa' Gunaratnes invincible Royal College rugby team of 1988
When the Royal team of 88 whipped
All their opponents, one asked,
Of all rugby teams, is this the best team thats ever been
For 15 players played and 16 matches won, Is no mean feat you know my son
And so we set our Daily News scribe
To see what was the best side
Which was the best team ever
A question that comes up frequently during the Bradby season (the Bradby needs no introduction to the rugby community, but for the record, it is the pinnacle of Sri Lanka rugby; a two-match affair between Royal and Trinity). The Royal College team of thirty years ago in 1988, was it the best team ever The answer is a big yes according to many Royalists, as well as Trinitians. The Royal team of 1988, led by inspirational leader Lasitha Bonsa' Gunaratne, won the league and the knock-out tournament. They beat Trinity in the first leg 24-0 (Colombo) and 13-0 in the second leg (Kandy).
Royals season extended to include a two-match tour of Hong Kong. The Royal boys of 88 won both games under Bonsa Gunaratne beating Stanley Fort Military Academy (37-22) and Hong Kong Combined Schools team (8-6), and thereby remained unbeaten over 16 matches. Thats a very rare achievement for a school side in a Sri Lanka schools rugby season, and a record that remains to-date.
Spectacular number eight, Bonsa Gunaratnes team, won the Bradby Shield in 88 after losing to Trinity three years in a row from 1985-87. Gunaratnes team also added the knock-out title (that time, it was the Premadasa Trophy) to the trophy cupboard of Royal College for the first time, after Isipathaana had won the knock-out championship in 86 under Chandana Deepthi, and Tyrrel Rajapakses Trinity lions won the second edition in 87. The Pathana team of 86 and the lions of 87 were also champion teams, as were the Thomian teams from 89-91.
Thus the 86-91 period saw six champion teams from four different schools. That the Thomians remained unbeaten from 89-91 is a remarkable feat. Was the Royal team of 88 the best It is a difficult call, because, on the one hand, it is a matter of perspective, and on the other hand, it depends on the analytical lens one uses. The Royal team of 88 is definitely up there with the very best, and to many it is the best team ever. Is it the best team of all Royal teams Definitely yes. Zulki Hamids Royal boys of 2002 were another remarkable lot; their 83-0 record against Trinity would surely stand the test of time, yet they were not an all-conquering side, whereas Bonsas team of 88 won all their matches.
They beat Dharmaraja (34-0), Vidyartha (36-9), Ananda (18-3), St. Peters (19-3), Isipathana (24-9), S. Thomas (10-9), St. Joseph's (17-4), Zahira (42-0). In the Knockout tournament for the R.Premadasa Trophy - quarter finals Royal beat Wesley (13-11) in the semis beat Ananda (11-6), and final beat Isipathana (13-0).
In the Royal team of 88, the forwards were formidable. Heavy prop forwards Mahima Wijesinghe and Madhawa Chandrasekera were granite-hard, while reliable hooker Niroshan Jayasinghe hooked well against his counterparts throughout the entire season, ensuring an abundance of possession. The two second row forwards Janoda Thoradeniya (vice-captain of the rugby team, and captain of the Royal basketball team in 1988) and Thilina Balasuriya were excellent in the line outs and in loose play. Alfred Hensman and Ruwan Jayasuriya, the two flankers constantly rattled the opposition and tackled them to a standstill. Skipper Lasitha Bonza was a tall, powerful and highly mobile number eight, with great footwork.
Royal had a sensational three quarter line that year and they were simply outstanding. Chanaka Seneviratne and Sanjeeva Abeysinghe formed the halves combination. The Royal team of 88 was unfortunate to miss-out on the services of exceptional fly-half Druvi Perera, who played rugby in Australia before returning to Royal in 1986. Perera, in his early teens, even played fly-half for CR & FC sevens team. But, as fate would have it, he had to hang his boots early into the 87 season, due to injury. Sanjeeva Abeysinghe was no Druvi Perera.
But Abeysinghe had his own bag of tricks, and was exceptional in his own right. Royals three-quarter moves often ended in tries through centres Anura Dhammika, New Zealander Bruce Cameron, wingers Somesh Selvaratnam, Tilak Silva and full back Shantha Fernando, joining the line forming the overlap. Fernando also had an outstanding season with his fine kicking boot slotting over many penalties and conversions being a footballer himself scoring over 130 points thus becoming the highest points scorer in that season. Royals quintessential captain of 88, Lasitha Gunaratne played as a prop forward in the years 1985, 1986, and 1987 for Royal College along with his elder brother Roshan Gunaratne.
Lasitha also represented CR & FC as a young boy playing as prop forward, at the age of 17. He was up against veteran club players such as Norman Silva, Hafeel Marso, J.K. Shanthikumar, Ali Sabri, Ravi Python Wijenathan, K.M. Navaratne, Sidath Nagahawatte, Razali Noordeen, Saman Jayasinghe, Hisham Abdeen, Nalin de Silva, Rex Anthony, Panda Wijeratne, Ajantha Samarakoon, Palitha Siriwardena and late Parakrama Samaraweera to name a few, yet came out successful against them in the end. Bonsa is the youngest player to captain CR at the age of 22, and also the first CR & FC rugby skipper to captain in three different years in 1992, 1993 and in 1995 as well. He also captained the Sri Lanka under 19 sevens team in the Roslyn Park seven a side tournament in England in 1988, and played for the Sri Lanka national under 24 team in 1987. He was recruited to the senior national team while still a schoolboy at the age of 18 to play as prop forward in the Sri Lanka national fifteen a side team in the 1988 rugby Asiad.
Winners take chances.
Like everyone else they fear failing,
But they refuse to let fear control them.
Winners don't give up.
When life gets rough they hang in
Until the going gets better.
Winners are flexible.
They realize there is more than one way
And they are willing to try others.
Winners know they are not perfect.
They respect their weaknesses
While making the most of their strengths.
Winners fall but they don't stay down.
They stubbornly refuse to let a fall
Keep them from climbing.
Winners don't blame fate for their failures
Nor luck for their successes.
Winners accept responsibility for their lives.
Winners are positive thinkers who see well in all things.
From the ordinary they make the extraordinary.
Winners believe in the path they have chosen.
Even when it's hard,
Even when others can't see where they are going.
Winners are patient.
They know a goal is only as worthy
As the effort that's required to achieve it.
Winners are people like you.
They make this world a better place to be.........
(Dedicated above to the 1988 Royal College victorious leader Lasitha 'Bonsa' Gunaratne, from his entire 88 rugby team mates).

Lawyers for Democracy hail high profile arrests
The Lawyers for Democracy (LfD) issuing a statement on the arrest of the Presidents Chief of Staff I.H.K Mahanama and State Timber Corporation Chairman P. Dissanayake hailed the efforts taken by the Bribery Commission to net the two high profile individuals.
The LfD said such arrests would have been unimaginable during the previous regime. The two individuals were arrested at a car park of a five star hotel in Colombo, while accepting a bribe of Rs, 20 million from an Indian businessman as an advance payment. The transaction relates to a deal in the shares of the Kantale Sugar Factory. According to officials from the Bribery Commission, the suspects had solicited a bribe of Rs. 560 million from the businessman but later reduced it to Rs. 100 million.
It is vital that the people recognize the courage displayed by officials in the Bribery Commission in the recent past where corruption cases were filed against powerful former officials like Gotabaya Rajapakse and a serving Court of Appeal Judge, Lfd said in a statement. Still, rogue elements mobilise supporters to protect the corrupt with the active support of the previous regime.
In this moment, when President Sirisenas chief of staff has been netted by an independent commission during a sting operation, there is only one pertinent question to ask: Given the impunity the former regime showed to crimes by its inner circle, would the arrest of Gamini Senarath, former Chief of Staff to President Mahinda Rajapaksa ever have been possible during his reign.
The LfD also hailed the head of the state for his impartiality which he demonstrated by refusing to interfere in the raid or the investigative process. It is our fervent and sincere hope that this shall be the course of future anti-corruption action in Sri Lanka going forward and other politicians in power will follow the exemplary conduct and precedent set by the President in this instance.
The Presidents office suspended of the two officials who were arrested by the commission. President Sirisena went on to instruct that the law be strictly enforced without any obstruction to the legal process.
We urge the people of Sri Lanka to take serious note of the urgent need to support institutions that are battling corruption within the system, and investigators in both the Bribery Commission and the Police Department, the statement said.

Marxism  changed  China- Xi
CHINA: The 200th anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx on Friday illustrated how times have changed in China, as a group of seven of Donald Trumps trade hawks spent the day in Beijing negotiating over the impending trade war.
Chinese President Xi Jinping gave a major speech on how Marxism still drove China onwards, while across town, Chinas top economic advisor, vice premier Liu He, upheld the principals of globalisation and free trade in talks with the American group.
The Marx anniversary speech, which was televised nationally, highlights that Xi is pushing the ruling Communist Party and its philosophy into the centre of Chinese life  on university campuses, in business and in government.
That this could occur at the same time as economic reform and opening up was explained by Xi as Marxism adapting to the times.
Among a small busload of foreign media invited to hear Xi speak, Fairfax Media struck up a conversation with a North Korean journalist. He strode smiling up the staircase in the Great Hall of the People, wearing the standard North Korean grey summer suit (worn without a shirt underneath) and obligatory Kim Jong-il and Kim Il-sung duo lapel badge.
It is rare for a North Korean reporter to be seen, let alone speak with western media. Marxs anniversary would be big in Pyongyang, he said.
Times were good, the reporter said. Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi had met with Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un this week, and North Koreas nuclear reactor would be publicly dismantled.
What was left unsaid was that China and South Korea have very likely offered North Korea a path for economic reform, out of old-school socialist planned economies, in exchange for nuclear dismantlement.
Marxism had changed China, said Xi, and scientific socialism was by no means an immutable dogma.
The great social changes in contemporary China are not ... a simple application of the template envisaged by a classical Marxist writer, nor a republication of the practice of socialism in other countries, nor a reprint of the modernisation of foreign countries, he said.
Marx was even invoked as a champion of globalisation. Xi gave an apparent dig at the Trump trade delegation across town.
Countries are more connected and interdependent to each other than ever before. An integrated world is there. Whoever rejects the world, the world will reject them, said Xi.
Xi said the world had undergone earth-shaking changes since the Communist Manifesto was published 170 years ago, but its general principles were entirely correct.
The speech reinforced that China has no intention of following western democratic reforms.
China faced unprecedented heavy tasks of reform and challenges and risks in governance, Xi said, but it had to use Marxism to solve its problems.Karl Marxs work can be explained in five minutes, five hours, in five years or in a half century, wrote French political thinker Raymond Aron.
A utopian vision of a just society for some, a blueprint for totalitarian regimes for others, Marxist thought is laid out in the Communist Manifesto and the three-volume Das Kapital.
The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggle, says the Communist Manifesto, co-written with Friedrich Engels and published in 1848.
Marx believed that humanitys core conflict rages between the ruling class, or bourgeoisie, that controls the means of production such as factories, farms and mines, and the working class, or proletariat, which is forced to sell their labour.
According to Marx, this conflict at the heart of capitalism -- of slaves against masters, serfs against landlords, workers against bosses -- would inevitably cause it to self-destruct, to be followed by socialism and eventually communism. Marx believed that religion, like a drug, helps the exploited to suppress their immediate pain and misery with pleasant illusions, to the benefit of their oppressors.
The quote usually paraphrased as religion is the opium of the people originates from the introduction of Marxs work A Contribution to the Critique of Hegels Philosophy of Right.
In full, it reads: Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people. The idea was used to justify brutal purges of religions in Russia, China and across eastern Europe.
Some scholars point out that Marx saw religion as only one of many elements explaining the enslavement of the proletariat and may have been surprised to see radical atheism become a core tenet of communist regimes.

Milk powder price hike applicable to new imports  Ministry clarifies
The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Cost of Living has recommended the Consumer Affairs Authority to allow milk powder importers to increase their retail price after repeated requests from the companies citing rising world prices amidst mounting losses.
These companies have been requesting us to permit them to increase the retail price for a while now.
 In order to ensure that consumers are not affected, we have exempted infant formula, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathiudeen said.
This price hike will only be applicable to milk powder manufactured or imported after May 5, he said.
The price of a kilo of milk powder was increased by Rs.50 while a 400g pack was increased by Rs.20. A 1kg packet of full cream milk powder which was sold at Rs.810 will now be sold at Rs.860.
The Ministry also confirmed that the price hike is only applicable to full cream milk powder and not other types such as infant formula or non-fat milk.
Clarifying futher, a communiqu from the Ministry cited that the Maximum Retail price of other different weighted milk powder packs would be increased pro rata (proportionally) based on these rates.
Minister Bathiudeen who is also a member of the Cabinet Sub-Committee said that the companies had requested for a bigger price hike than what the committee had approved.
The recent history of allowing MRPs of one Kg of milk powder has been Rs 810 (May 2012 onwards), Rs 962 (from Feb-2014), Rs 810 (from Feb-2015), Rs 810 (from March-2015), Rs 810 (from July 2016), and Rs 860 (latest revision of May 4, 2018).
The allowed MRP of 400 Gram milk powder packs has been Rs 325 (2012 May onwards), Rs 386 (from Feb-2014), Rs 325 (from Feb-2015), Rs 325 (from March-2015), Rs 325 (from July 2016), and Rs 345 (latest revision of May 4, 2018).

Minister defends BOI in wake of bribery arrests
Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said he did not believe the recent arrests of senior government officials for soliciting bribes would affect foreign investment.
Naturally, we are concerned about these things happening, he said at the ministry offices in the World Trade Centre.
(But) as far as the Board of Investment is concerned, we dont have that issue, Minister Samarawickrama added.
The Bribery Commission arrested Presidents Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation Chairman P. Dissanayake on Thursday night for accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million from an Indian businessman. They were suspended by President Maithripala Sirisena last morning. The bribe appeared to be related to the deal to revive the now-defunct Kantalai Sugar Factory.
Though the BOI was involved in the beginning of the project in 2015, Minister Samarawickrama said it had not been involved since the deal had been tied up in arbitration following a dispute over land allocation.
He said the Bribery Commissions investigation was a sign of good governance.
Because of our transparency only that this is came out, he said.

NEW TECHNOLOGY, CHALLENGE TO SOUTH ASIA - Mangala
Finding the capital and how to absorb the many thousands of people who may lose their jobs with the advent of technology are key concerns for many South Asian countries including Sri Lanka, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
Sri Lanka has a very high number of Accountants compared to other parts of the world other than in India. But we have also been told that by 2030, accountants will be redundant with the advent of Artificial Intelligence. We have to prepare ourselves from now on. At the other end of the spectrum,blue collar workers, such as drivers and factory workers are also affected. These are the challenges we are trying to grapple with, Minister Samaraweera said.
Minister Samaraweera made the above observations participating in a four-member panel discussion on Technology for Change on CNBC Global parallel to the 51st Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board of Governors Annual Meeting 2018 at the ADB Headquarters in Manila.
ADB President Takehiko Nakao, President of Kickstart Ventures Minnette Navarette and Managing Director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Nandita Parshad were the other panelists, who participated in the programme conducted by CNBCs Anchor Oriel Morrison.
The discussion focused on the emerging new technologies and their impact on developing Asian countries.
Samaraweera pointed out that Sri Lanka is still at the second Industrial Revolution and trying to leap into the digital (4th) Industrial Revolution to catch up for lost time due to three-decade bitter and ruthless war.
Unfortunately, as a country we could not harness our full potential because we could not come to terms with the diversity of our own nation. We are trying to catch up for lost time and in doing so it is not that easy because populist slogans are again trying to bring out extreme forms of nationalism to the forefront. They portray technological advances as a threat rather than an opportunity.The challenges before us are monumental, but we are determined to face them strong, the Minister said.
The choice before us is whether we are going to enter into a new era of innovation and creativity or into another period high unemployment and anarchy. We have to adjust ourselves as quickly as possible to the changes taking place in the rest of the world. That is why we are promoting ICT education and changing school curriculum, he commented.
To absorb young minds to the new technology, the Government has a programme to provide free Wi-Fi to all school and provide tablets to rural school children free of charge. We have selected 14,000 schools as a pilot project for this purpose. In the same time, Farmers Unions, Women Societies etc. are also being assisted to adapt to these changes.
As a country we are determined to leap forward into the fourth Industrial Revolution without too many bruises, he added.
The minister said that people in the rural areas of Sri Lanka have superstitions associated with new technology and changing peoples mind-sets are important to overcome such barriers.
Some people, even among the educated, think of those technologies as a threat rahter than an opportunity, he said.
Kickstart Ventures President Minnette Navarette giving her opinion on Minister Samaraweeras remarks on providing free tablets to school children said,adapting to new technologies requires changes to the entire education system than simply providing the computers or the devices.
We have had an experience where we had donated computers to some public schools and a year later they were still in the boxes. The reason isnt that the schools did not want them. It was because bringing computers into the schools meant they needed electrification, technicians, maintenance, to be able get Internet to them and the teachers needed to learn how to use them. Yes, make the investments for sure, but also make investments in people to allow them to come into the world of technology with more openness and experience, she pointed out.
The forum also discussed private sector involvement in technological development and Minister Samaraweera joining in the conversation said Sri Lanka offers very attractive incentives to both local and international investors in the private sector interested in robotics, science and new technologies.
ADB President Takehiko Nakao advised the developing countries to be extra-cautious of the potential risks to fraud and cyber-attack when it comes to financial technology.

Non-science of politics in Cabinet shuffle
What is possibly the longest reshuffle of the Cabinet and other ministers has ended with hardly any signs of the use of science in the task, as promised so often in the wait for these changes. There are many questions that could be raised about science, if any, used in the allocation of portfolios, and the combination of subjects. The wider issue that has prevailed is the politics of continuance or survival of governance. The new ministers are tasked to take the government till the next general election in mid-2020, or at least till a new presidential poll in early 2020.
The ascendance of the UNP in the Cabinet is in keeping with the results of the last general election in August 2015, when the party led by Ranil Wickremesinghe, emerged as the largest party in parliament. The situation changed with the forming of the unity government bringing a section of the SLFP to it, led by President Sirisena. The resignation of the 16 SLFP members, Cabinet ministers and others, who voted against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe at the recent No Confidence Motion, has certainly altered the structure of government, with President Sirisenas SLFP members in government reducing to 25.
When Parliament opens its next session on Wednesday (8th) these 16 SLFPers will be seated in the Opposition benches, as an independent group, but under the leadership of President Sirisena, who remains Head of The Cabinet and Government. They have not moved to the Joint Opposition (JO) of Mahinda Rajapaksa, but do have a not so hidden attraction to them. The politics in the coming months will certainly show the stresses and tensions of this divided SLFP  many being pulled towards the JO, some remaining with President Sirisena, and some also drawn towards the UNP.
Play of politics
The Cabinet re-shuffle itself had little of political impact, in the context of the divisions within government, but it did show the play of politics in the voting of the NCM against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. Apart from the reduction of SLFP members in the Cabinet, there is also the inclusion of Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, as the new minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs. He earlier left the Cabinet, as Minister of Justice and Buddhasasana, when the UNP called for his resignation, due to increasing criticism of delays in the legal process against those of the previous government allegedly involved in fraud and corruption, and his criticism of the economic relations with China. While very critical of government since his resignation, he voted against the NCM on the Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, with no support for the JO. His inclusion in the new Cabinet shows a play of the science or skill of political reconciliation. However, being in charge of Higher Education, apart from Cultural Affairs, certainly places him in a ministry of constant conflict among academics, students, and the public, a major area of conflict within government in the past three years. One has to see how much he has of the science of negotiation in divisive disputes.
In some show of the science of reality, President Sirisena did turn down a request by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe to include Ravi Karunanayake, former Finance and Foreign Affairs Minister, in the new Cabinet. His association with those involved in the Central Bank Bond issue is well known, and recorded in the related Presidential Commission Report, too. He has been publicly forgetful of the Penthouse rents he received from such sources. These matters did cause him to resign from his portfolio, while declaring his innocence. This request to have him in the present Cabinet was certainly not stuff of the science of clean politics.
The post re-shuffle politics will see new pressures from anti-Ranil SLFPers, with a push from the JO, for changes in key office- bearers of the SLFP and the UPFA  Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera. They were appointed secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA by President Sirisena following disagreements with the former office-bearers - Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha in 2015. In moves to bring about a government without any SLFP association with the UNP, the new independent Blues seated in Opposition benches, will make moves for further breaks in government ranks.
This is an aspect of politics the SLFPs official leader, President Sirisena, will have to pay special attention to, if the latest Cabinet shakeup is to have any impact on governance.
Green divisions
The UNP faced its own major crisis, with defeat in the recent local government polls, which it covered up well, especially the threat to its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe in the NCM. But not all promises of a major shakeup within the party, with effective restructuring have been wholly successful. A Politbureau is appointed, but the key positions are still in the hands of the Party Leader. The recent meetings of the Politbureau and Working Committee, did call for inner party democracy, and changes in the Party Constitution, especially on appointing of key party personnel.
The party saw strong opposition to the re-appointment of Ravi Karunanayake as Assistant Leader, which saw a very senior member, Joseph Michael Perera, from Kandana-Ja-ela leave the Working Committee. Sajith Premadasa, Deputy Leader too, had made serious criticisms of key appointments, especially that of the General Secretary. The new Gen. Sec. Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has given up Cultural Affairs from his portfolio as Minister, to give him more time for party work. This seems a clear endorsement of the wider opinion that the post of General Secretary should not be held by an active elected politician.
There is a strong body of its young membership that seeks reforms recommended by the Ruwan Wijewardene Committee on party reforms. There is a body of membership that sees many with good leadership qualities, kept out by the present trends of party organisation. There are reports of backbench members of parliament not attending party meetings in opposition to the trends against democracy within the party.
A call for a more democratic structure in the UNP is certainly important in the wider context of democracy within the country, where most political parties that claim to support democracy, function with doors closed to the democratic process. It will be interesting to know how far and fast this move for reform within the UNP will move, especially in the context of the upcoming Provincial Council polls and the later General Election.
Tea sympathy
The government has taken a major decision in favour of the tea and rubber industries, by lifting the ban of Glyphosate  the herbicide/weedicide  that has caused major threats and hardships, especially to the tea industry.
There will be objections, especially by Athuraliye Rathana Thera and those supportive of him, who call for organic fertilizers only. While the call for and use of organic fertilizer is certainly most useful, there is so far no scientific evidence produced to show that Glyphosate is or has been the cause of the Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDu) that does affect a large section of the population engaged in agriculture, and over which it was banned.
The search for the proper cause of this tragic illness must continue, and all facilities both economic and scientific must be provided for it. But, this does not mean that the major export led agriculture crops- tea and rubber  must be endangered by the ban on Glyphosate, which has for many years been a major input of value to these industries, and thus to the national economy, and also the people engaged in these industries.
There is also a major threat of Sri Lanka losing the Japanese market for tea due to the Japanese objections of the use of MCPA - a Glyphosate substitute - used by the tea industry. The tea industry has already lost Rs 20 billion due to this.
It is also necessary to understand that the EU postponed any ban on Glyphosate for four years, enabling it to be phased out while a proper substitute or substitutes are found. Sri Lanka is certainly in no situation to face the harsh economic consequences of this ill-thought-out ban, which does not have full scientific support.
It is necessary for environmentalists and others interested in supporting organic fertilizer to carry on their research and publicity to bring about a proper understanding of the dangers that may prevail here from Glyphosate and also the actual threat of CKDu.
Why not 21A
With the JVPs call for abolition of the Executive Presidency, with its proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which is getting increased public attention, there are also civic groups thinking in terms of a 21A, which will reduce or keep a proper control of the number of representatives elected to the Parliament and the Provincial Councils.
The example of what has happened with the numbers elected to the local authorities, shows the need for urgent action to bring proper democratic controls on the number of representatives elected to legislative and administrative bodies.

Paddy farmers to get 50 kg fertiliser bag at Rs 500
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday instructed Colombo Commercial Fertilizers Limited and Lak Pohora to release their stocks to the market without delay.
This instruction was given at a meeting held yesterday at the Ministry, following complaints received from farmers in various parts of the country regarding the non-delivery of subsidized fertilizer. The government has already taken measures to provide subsidized fertilizer to farmers under the re-implemented fertilizer subsidy programme.
Under this programme, a 50kg bag of fertilizer will be sold to paddy farmers at Rs 500 and the fertilizer will be issued through Agrarian Services Centres.A bag of fertilizer for farmers who grow other crops will be sold at Rs.1500.

Parliament not involved in moving Agriculture Ministry - Speaker
The Speakers Office releasing a statement yesterday, denied reports that it was Parliament which had directed the Agriculture Ministry be moved from Rajamalwatte to Rajagiriya.
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera had previously made the statement that the Agriculture Ministry was moved to a building in Rajagiriya on a rent of Rs 23.5 million a month, from Rajamalwatte due to a request made by Parliament.
In 2015, when the new government came into power, there was no office space for the newly appointed Oversight Committees and the Speaker had directed that the necessary space be built in the garage premises of the ground floor in Parliament.
But at the time, the government was focused on providing all MPs with office space close to Parliament. And thus with the dual purpose of providing space both to the Oversight Committee and MP offices in the same building, the government made the decision to take over the premises of the Agriculture Ministry for this purpose and to shift the Ministry elsewhere, the statement read further.
It was not a decision made by Parliament. He further noted that there was no proposal made by Parliament to move the Agriculture Ministry in part or in whole from Rajamalwatte and to shift it to a building in Rajagiriya. In keeping with the governments decision, steps were taken to refurbish the Rajamalwatte building for Parliamentary purposes with labour provided by the Navy and the old equipment was renovated, saving cost on having to spend on new ones.
The Speakers office, he further noted under his leadership functioned with utmost transparency and did its best to save on public expenditure.

Path to sustainable development
Muhammad Yunus, (born June 28, 1940) is a Bangladeshi, banker, economist, social capitalist and civil society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty and that across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development.
In February 2011, Yunus together with Saskia Burstyn, Sophie Eisenmann and Hans Reitz co-founded Yunus Social Business  Global Initiatives (YSB). YSB creates and empowers social businesses to address and solve social problems around the world. As the international implementation arm for Yunus vision of a new, humane capitalism, YSB manages incubator funds for social businesses in developing countries and provides advisory services to companies, governments, foundations and NGOs.
Successful enterprising activities
Contrary to what is often claimed, microcredits are not a way out of poverty; on the contrary they most often result in a greater deprivation and humiliation of their victims. On the Indian sub-continent 65 million people have taken on a microcredit, 90% are women. Worldwide, women count for 81% of microcredit users (112 million). After an enquiry among microcredit victims and militants acting in their defence, we present here some emblematic cases. We point out that we have been unable to meet any advocates of microcredits.
Contrary to the usual claim, (affirmation) that a small loan will permit the development of successful enterprising activities, in most cases the users have used microcredit to cover more imperative and immediate necessities such as rents, loans, costs of schooling or medical treatment. Microcredits in Sri Lanka have most often been granted to women without any income, say Eric Toussaint the famous social worker and his group.
These examples were all mentioned when they met over a dozen indebted women in Negombo; they had come at the bidding of a local organisation that is active on housing rights. This organisation represented by a lawyer and discussion took part a few days before, in the 7th annual CADTM South Asia workshop that discussed public and private debt and particularly the nefarious effects of microcredit.
This association, along with many activists that they encountered during their stay has become aware of the rapid expansion of microcredit over the last few years and the distress it is causing among the poor classes, especially the poorest who have incomes of less than 100 euros a month. It must be noted that Lankan minimum wage is at 10,000 rupees (52 euros) a month.
In above mentioned cases minimum rents for a family are at this level and the minimum wage is not guaranteed because many jobs are in the parallel sectors of the economy (undeclared employment). The families they met were between four and six persons trying to live eat, be housed, educated and cared for, where necessary, on one income. In all the cases they met, the women who took out micro loans did so in order to face one of these basic necessities. In all cases the women were forced to seek further loans, sometimes from local usurers, to cover repayments of previous loans with such extortionate conditions that normal repayments become impossible.
All these stories confirm the declarations made during the assembly organised by the CADTM in Colombo on April 6 to 8, 2018. The representatives of populist social movements from all over Lanka were present. The distress of these families push many women to seeking work in the Middle East and, so they are absent for long periods.
These jobs do not always allow the women to pay off their debt. Many women, despite promises made, find they are not paid for their work, which is often the cause of even more oppression. It was reported that employment agencies for the Gulf States are forcing women to take the contraceptive pill, bringing credibility to the many reported cases of domestics being raped. What is more, Lanka has just been through a long civil war causing many women to be single mothers, particularly among the Tamil people in the North and East of the country.
Self-employed occupations
Two conclusions may be drawn from the workshop: firstly it is necessary to urge a movement of non-payment of microcredit debts in order to bring the authorities to the negotiating table with the radical mass movement for access to soft loans. Secondly it is also necessary to integrate the resistance to abusive microcredit into a comprehensive struggle for income increases, a guaranteed minimum for the fishermen, small farmers and other self-employed occupations, improving public services, authorities creating more jobs and measures in favour of small producers.
It is fundamental to put the question of microcredit into a worldwide perspective; breaking the Vicious Cycle of Illegitimate Private Debt in the global South. In general the debt system is gathering steam in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, just as in the highly industrialized countries, after going through several fundamental changes over the past 40 years. Cycle of illegitimate private debt came mainly since the outbreak of the Third World debt crisis in the early 1980s. Austerity policies aiming for structural adjustments encourage private debt. Structural adjustment programmes were widely implemented on the pretext of the public debt crisis. The late 20th century saw the domination of austerity policies and structural adjustment programmes in most countries, particularly in the so-called developing countries and the former Eastern bloc.
International institutions imposed these structural adjustment programmes, with the willing complicity of right-wing governments in order to implement a series of counter-reforms conducive only to the interests of large private enterprises, the great powers and local ruling classes. These policies have degraded the living conditions of a large section of the population, particularly in the agricultural regions but also in the urban areas. This is the opinion of local and international socialists.

This award had gone missing from Wednesday evening and a complaint over the incident had been made to the Bambalapitiya police by the family member of late Dr Lester Peries over the phone.
The Bambalapitiya police had deployed a team to investigate into the incident as they received the complaint.

Presidents Chief of Staff, STC Chairman remanded
Presidents Chief of Staff I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake who were arrested by the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) last Thursday were remanded by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara until May 9.
They were taken into the custody by CIABOC while allegedly accepting the bribe in a hotel in Colombo and later produced before Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe.
According to CIABOC officials, I.H.K. Mahanama had demanded a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale sugar factory.
Mahanama had allegedly attended to this matter of settling the transaction some time back while he was the Land Ministry Secretary. However the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was high and demanded to reduce it. Within several weeks, Mahanama had allegedly agreed to accept Rs.100 million.
Thereafter, the Indian investor had made a complaint before the CIABOC and the two suspects were arrested by Bribery Commission officials in the car park of a leading hotel in Colombo on Thursday evening.

A promise kept
One of the key elections planks and pledges of the Rainbow Coalition, which swept to power in 2015, was taking a tough stand on corruption and malpractices at all levels in society. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe expressed their personal commitment to eradicate corruption as part of their quest to uphold the principles of good governance.
They pledged to probe the misdeeds of the previous regime, which is usually given whenever a new Government comes to power. There were many who dismissed this as political revenge. People could not be blamed for thinking in this manner  after all, they have the bitter experience of the politically motivated jail term imposed on former Army Commander, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka during the previous regime over a minor tender issue.
But the anti-corruption drive of the President and the Prime Minister was not motivated by political considerations of this nature. They made it clear that the anti-graft drive will not be limited to those associated with the previous regime. Anyone connected to the ruling apparatus in any way found engaging in acts of corruption will be dealt with mercilessly, they promised. Again, this pledge was greeted with a lot of sceptism and even sarcasm.
Both leaders however understood that for this pledge to work, the Police, Judiciary, anti-corruption bodies and other enforcement bodies must regain their independence. Without this assurance, officials tend to turn a blind eye to any acts of corruption by those connected to the ruling party. It is in this context that several fully Independent Commissions were either reactivated or established anew to enable the officials to act without any fear.
Among them was the Commission to Investigate Acts of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) which had been literally run to the ground by the previous regime. Since it was reinvigorated, it has been doing great work, probing alleged acts of corruption by politicians from all sides, public officials, business people and various other parties.
We saw the biggest indication of its impartiality, integrity, fearlessness and investigative talent with the arrest of Presidents Chief of Staff, I.H.K. Mahanama and State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P. Dissanayake over the charge of accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million from an Indian businessman at a Colombo hotel on Thursday. This is perhaps the most high-profile arrest it has made in recent times and completely negates the allegation spread by the Joint Opposition that they have been unfairly targeted by the CIABOC and other law enforcement agencies. It also nullifies the common refrain that only the small fry get caught in the bribery net while the big fish go scot-free.
On his part, the President has instructed relevant officials to show no mercy and take strict legal action against the two officials. He also instructed officials to immediately suspend the services of both officials facing bribery allegations. The President deserves plaudits for his swift and impartial actions. Now there is no doubt that the law will take its course, unhindered by any political interference.
This arrest also brings to the fore a marked difference between this Government and the previous one. Under that regime, not even the servant of a ruling party leader would have been arrested as anyone who was even remotely connected to the powers that be was strictly off-limits for the law enforcement agencies. Anyone who dared to go against this unofficial dictum had to pay a very heavy price. The overnight impeachment of former Chief Justice Shiranee Bandaranayake for apparently giving a verdict that affected a top minister is a case in point.
On the other hand, this arrest is a latest in a series of cases against persons connected to the current Government who have been implicated in acts of corruption. The Government appointed a Presidential Commission to investigate the Treasury Bond issue, which summoned even Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. This is in fact, the first time that a Government investigating body summoned a sitting Prime Minister. Pursuant to inquiries on this issue, several top officials of Perpetual Treasuries Limited are in custody and an Interpol Red Notice has been issued on former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran.
Quite apart from corruption cases, the Government has let the law run its course in other instances of law and order violations committed by powerful persons connected to those in power. When the Police informed President Sirisena that his brother had caused a fatal accident, his immediate reaction was that the normal law of the land should prevail. Accordingly, the Presidential sibling was taken into custody and the President has not interfered in the case at all.
There are several significant takeaways from this episode of high-profile arrests. It has reaffirmed the importance of establishing independent commissions and implementing the strict policies of the Government against bribery and corruption. It has also highlighted the independent and impartial background created by the Government that has enabled law enforcement authorities to perform their duties independently without any trepidation. The time has come to expedite all probes into acts of corruption and take strict steps to eliminate this scourge from our society.

Rajarata mega projects accelerated to resolve drinking water issue
Nimal Wijesinghe,
Anuradhapura Additional District Group Corr.
Mega water projects will be accelerated to resolve the drinking water issue in Rajarata and other areas under the instructions of the President.
Accordingly, a special discussion was held recently at the President's Office led by President Secretary Austin Fernando.
Senior Officials from the Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry, Town Planning and Water Supply Ministry, Water Supply and Drainage Board, Mahaweli Authority, Wildlife, and Forest Conservation and Agrarian Development Department participated in the discussion.
The committee decided to get water for the Mega Anuradhapura North and the Mega Trincomale Water Supply Projects from the Yan Oya River and the Yan Oya Reservoir once it was completed. The proposed Mahawilachchiya Water Project would be included in the project and additional water would be taken from the Kudawilachchiya tank. The latter in the Wilpaththu sanctuary area was now abandoned. The Water Supply Board will provide Rs. 225 million to the Irrigation Department to renovate the tank. It was agreed to educate the Rajangane farmers about the Thambuttegama Water Supply Project for them to avoid false information.
Rs. 19,000 million will be granted by the Chinese government and contractors were selected to commence the project. The proposed Eppawala/Rajangane/Nochchiyagama and Giribawa integrated mega water supply scheme will begin at a cost of Rs. 50 billion. Israel will fund the project.
The Mahaweli Authority has agreed to provide water for the Palugaswewa Water Project. Water will be taken from Huruluwewa to commence the Galenbindunuwewa Water Project.

Reducing spate of injuries was the highlight  Prof Arjuna de Silva
Professor Arjuna de Silva who resigned with Dr Harindu Wijesinghe from the Sri Lanka Cricket medical panel said that the highlight of their four-year association with SLC was reducing the spate of injuries to cricketers down to zero.
Before we went for the Indian tour last year we had zero injuries which I believe was a good achievement, said Prof de Silva.
Speaking further Prof de Silva stated, We streamlined the rehabilitation and injury management areas. We started the rehab lab with two foreign physios - one for rehab and one for injury management. The medical team today is very big unlike in the past where there was only one physio. Now there are two foreign physios and around four local physios. One physio is doing rehab while the other physio tours with the team, which I think is a good plan.
We also introduced facilities to liaise with foreign consultants like Dr Chamindu in England and Prof Siri Kannangara in Australia. We also streamlined anti-doping and it has been quite okay during our period, players have been made aware of their responsibilities, he said.
Prof de Silva and Dr Wijesinghe resigned from the SLC medical panel due to pressure of work.
The university students who were on the road have decided to come back for their term so there is a lot of time commitment which is the main problem for my resigning from the panel. Dr Harindu is also stepping down for the same reason, said Prof de Silva.

Royal College, Colombo will have a massive edge over Trinity College, Kandy when they scrum down for the second leg of the 74th Bradby Shield rugby encounter at Trinity College grounds in Pallekele, Kandy today commencing 4.00pm.
The junior game for the C. E. Simitharachchi trophy will be played prior to the first XV encounter.
The two teams look almost even but Royal has a massive edge due to having a 32 points lead winning the first leg (39-7) at Royal Complex, Colombo a fortnight back.
Trinity will be making every effort to beat the Royalists in their own den as they are playing in front of their home crowd in Kandy.
The team that takes control of the game within the first 30 minutes as they did in the first leg should hold the key to winning the Bradby Shield.
The outcome of the second leg would mainly depend on how the Trinity three quarters will make use of the good ball. Trinity has always enjoyed the luxury of speedy and penetrative set of three quarters and there is no exception this time too.
If the Trinity forwards could secure the good ball and feed their three quarter line more often, then Royal will face a tough task. In the first leg in Colombo Trinity failed to grab possession and hence their three quarters were kept on cold storage.
Royal has its own strength to give Lions a testing time as they could boast of a mobile eight who will use their heavy forwards to score through the famous rolling maul.
When one talks about the success of Royal forwards, it goes back to that brilliant side of Royal 2015 with their unsung hero (highest try scorer in the league that year) and rolling maul specialist number eight Supun Warnakulasooriya who scored four back to back tries in the second leg at Royal complex.
Experienced wing three quarter and playmaker Sabith Feroze will captain Royal who will make every effort to thrash the Lions in Kandy to retain the Bradby Shield for the fourth consecutive year. But everything will depend on how their granite hard forwards will play today.
Royal has enjoyed a fabulous season this year having won all their matches against Kingswood College Kandy (29-3), St. Anthony's College Kandy(55-13), S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia (55-nil), St. Josephs College Maradana (18-13) and Trinity College Kandy (39-7 Bradby1st leg) in the ongoing 2018 Singer league rugby championship.
Royal College head coach (former Royal College rugby vice captain, CR and Sri Lanka national captain) Dushanth Lewke told the Daily News: Its a new game this time around and since we are playing them at their home venue, we are expecting a much tougher match than the first leg.
Leading Trinity in the 2018 Bradby second leg will be Sri Lanka national under 18 player and full back Avishka Sheik, who is incidentally the son of formidable 1976 Bradby winning Royal College rugby team full back S.E.Sheik.
Trinity had a slightly low record this season in this years 2018 Singer league, and they have failed to remain unbeaten. Trinity has two wins to their credit winning against arch rivals St.Anthonys College Kandy (15-11) and S Thomas College Mount Lavina (34-24), while losing to St.Josephs College Colombo (25-32), Kingswood College Kandy (21-23) and Royal in the Bradby 1st leg (7-39).
It is pouring down rain at Pallekelle today (Friday), so I dont really know what the ground and weather conditions are going to be when the match commences tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon, said Lote Raikabula, head coach of Trinity College Kandy and former Fiji and All Blacks seven's rugby star.
We highly respect our opponents Royal, and we definitely want to perform better than the first leg in front of our own Trinity crowd.
The boys and the management are very disappointed how we played the game and how the first leg ended in Colombo. We want to put up a really good performance and play better rugby than in Colombo to make our Trinity supporters both young and old happy, he said.
Of the 73 encounters to-date, Trinity leads with 39 wins to Royals 32 and there have been two ties in the series - in 1992 (3-3) and (0-0) in 2016 (22-17) and (13-18).
Over the years, the match has produced many top class Sri Lankan players and traditions that could only be witnessed at the Bradby Shield encounter.
Whatever the outcome of the game one guaranteed factor is that the thousands of rugby fans who will fill the Trinity grounds at Pallekelle in Kandy to capacity are assured of a game of fast open rugby.
Ravi Bandaranayake, the captain of Trinity College in 1981, will be the chief guest at today's second leg.
The match will be refereed by Rohan Fernando.

Royal really tame the Trinity 'Lion'
Royal smashed unbeaten Trinity to smithereens with a rousing display to win by 19 points (2 goals, 2 tries and a penalty) to nil in the First Leg of the Bradby Shield match played yesterday at Longden Place.
Royal were just great. They rode determination and resoluteness right from the word 'go' to have Trinity in a vice-like grip out of which they just could not break free.
It might not have been an altogether elegant or classical display by Royal, but the manner, in which they played, hell-bent on destroying anything ahead of them, provided a truly stirring performance.
Their forwards completely outplayed Trinity's 'eight' in the loose. Quicker on the loose ball they pounced on each stray pass to make some rushes that had the Trinity defence rattled and shaken. Skipper de Silva led them in the loose with his most striking performance indeed, and had splendid support from Tilak de Silva, Kannangara and Yousoof.
BIG BOOB
For once, the Trinity forwards were being dictated to harried and hustled in the loose they had a tough job containing the rampaging Royal forwards and furthest from their minds was the support they could have leant to their outsides.
But where Royal really exploited was in the weakness that lay in Trinity's full back.
Trinity made the biggest tactical rugby blunder of the year in shifting their regular fullback, Shafi Jainu Deen to the inside three quarter berth and bringing in their Under 17 full back.
Jainu Deen has been the designer of Trinity's attacking rugger and, at inside, he was too easy a target for the Royal defence.
All Royal had to do was kick to the full back - and instantly they were placed in an attacking position.
That's exactly what they did and they stayed in attack right through the game, reducing Trinity to a rattled, shaken and inept fifteen.
PURPOSE
But whatever Trinitys tactical mistakes were theres no taking the shine off Royal's magnificent, glorious win.
They played with the will to win - and played it with such purpose and determination that there really was no stopping them.
White, the Trinity outside stammered and crashed in their play, the Royal threes moved with far greater sting. Trinity's halves combine of Ismail and Buthpitiya was not a patch on the Royal's combine of Malwatte and Samarawickrema.
Consequently Royal were able to launch more moves while Trinity could not come up with a single complete move, being tacked in possession or forced to kick ahead.
By far the most outstanding three quarter was Royal's centre, Jagath Fernando. His defence was superb, and in attack he was the player who fashioned Royal's moves.
It was fitting he should have scored the best try of the match when he intercepted a pass from forty yards out and scorched through to side-step the fullback and score.
GIFT TRY
Royal knocked up eight points in the first ten minutes of the game. First, winger Soyza scored off a move begun from a loose ruck about five yards out. Then off a five yard scrum in Trinity's '25' their scrum half Buthpitya slung a pass that went astray in Trinty's in-goal area.
Trinity, rather than touch down in defence, juggled around and the ball rolled loose for Yousoof to touch down. C.T. de Silva converted to make it 8-nil.
This gift try completely knocked the bottom off Trinity - and Royal were set for a scoring spree. Before half-time was through, they scored again when the forwards started a foot rush from their own half, booted the ball right to the goal line for winger Soyza to touch down. C.T. de Silva converted 13-nil.
Then came Jagath Fernando's solo try, and late in the game C.T. de Silva kicked a penalty to make it 19-nil.

Royal win easily
Royal enjoyed one of their finest hours in recent Bradby Shield games when they thrilled a crowd of over 7,000 by toppling Trinity with a sparkling 19-0 victory in a first 'leg' match, played at Longden Place, yesterday.
Trinity were out paced, out manoeuvred and outclassed by this 'new look' Royal team. This was apparent from the way Royal set off from the kick-off.
The Royal three-quarters were always threatening in attack and with better handling and passing they had to score. The Trinitians, on the contrary, were a nervous lot. They dropped their passes and were rushed to errors so often that it made things easier for Royal to drive a thick wedge in the loose through quick heels and mount their attacks.
Of the four tries that Royal scored, the best came late in the game when 15-year-old Jagath Fernando intercepted a pass near the halfway mark and ran straight to score mid right. C.T. de Silva converted.
Royal had a better supply of the ball through the good work of hooker Punithakumar in the set pieces and L.A.I. de Silva in the lines out. And every time the hall came their way Samarawickrema slung his passes swiftly to Malwatte for the entire line to engage some hard running.
The Royal forwards outwitted Ajith Abeyratne, Omar Furlounge and Shanti Kumar. All this was the good work of C.R. de Silva, who was ably supported by Rex Pereira, Yousoof, LAL de Silva, Punithakumar and Kannangara.
Powerful line kicking by Jagath Fernando kept Trinity pegged in their 25 during the first ten minutes of play. Maintaining pressure near the goalline Royal scored in the 12th minute.
A quick heel from a set piece10 yards from the goalline saw the ball go down to winger HSD Soysa who fell over for an unconverted try.
They came hack again in quest of more and hustled full back Nugawela to err behind his goalline and lob a pass for Yousoof to pounce on it and score a try. C.T. de Silva goaled this.
Three minutes before the half Jagath Fernando began a dribble in mid field and Nugawela once again collapsed under the onslaught for winger Soysa to grab the ball and score a try. C.T. de Silva goaled it for Royal to lead 18-0 at the half.
After the restart came Jagath Fernandos try and later a penalty goal put over by Tilak de Silva made the final tally 19-0.

Samurdhi recipients, staff to get better deal - Harrison
Unresolved issues of Samurdhi officers and staff would be solved fast and Samurdhi recipients would be empowered, Social Empowerment Minister P.Harrison said.
He said Samurdhi Officers had been stagnating in the same position deprived of promotions and career opportunities. He said their issues have to be addressed soon as it was a grave injustice. Then only their fullest service could be gained for the benefit of the Samurdhi recipients,
The minister assumed duties at the Social Empowerment Ministry at Sethsiripaya yesterday.
He said although Samurdhi programme continued for a long period under the previous government after the Janasaviya programme, the country had yet to reach the expected targets. He said President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had placed their confidence in him to deliver on the expected targets in reaching the rural masses.
The Minister it is for the first time that the Samurdhi subject had been vested under a UNP Minister.But nobody needs to take me as a monster, the Minister said. I would like to take the support of all and to empower the poor Samurdhi recipients as it is a national responsibility.

Singapore FTA will create jobs - Malik
Contrary to reports that the new Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) would disproportionately benefit Singapore, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama said it would create new jobs and revenue at home.
This process will generate more employment opportunities for Sri Lankans, including our professionals, he said.
He was speaking at the ministry offices at the World Trade Centre on Friday.
The allegation that Singaporeans will be able to freely take Sri Lankan jobs is a diabolical lie, Minister Samarawickrama said. The FTA does allow experts and senior management employed by foreign investors to obtain time-bound work visas, however. Minister Samarawickrama further rejected the claim that the FTA was signed without Cabinet approval, pointing to the Cabinet Decision of January 16, which authorised him to sign the agreement a few days later.
There have also been concerns that ASEAN countries would use Singapore as a point of entry to take advantage of the lower tariffs into Sri Lanka.
But, K.J. Weerasinghe, the FTAs chief negotiator, pushed back on that notion, saying that that the FTA had rules of origin and other safeguards. Speaking broadly about foreign direct investment, Minister Samarawickrama said the governments trade liberalization policies were showing concrete benefits.
Last year we achieved a record investment of 1.9 billion dollars, he said. This year we are expecting an increase to 2.5 billion dollars.
This clearly shows that the policies of our government are well-received by the international community, and well-received by our exporters, he added.
Minister Samarawickrama said the government was currently negotiating Free Trade Agreements with India and China, and was exploring the possibility of a deal with Thailand as well.
We are on the correct path, he said.

Smith back in Australia to win back trust after tampering scandal
Sydney, Friday: Deposed Australia captain Steve Smith has returned home from time out overseas, saying he is prepared to win back trust after his role in a high-profile ball-tampering scandal.
Smith, who was sacked and sent home in disgrace after the third Test against South Africa, had been lying low in New York but made his first appearance on social media in a month to thank the cricket public for giving him a second chance and his family for their support.
The former skipper posted a photo of himself and fiancee Dani back in Sydney and said he wouldn't be taking his fight to earn back trust for granted. "It's great to be back home in Australia. I have had some time away to come to terms with everything and now it's time to get back into it," Smith wrote on Instagram on Friday.
"The amount of emails and letters I have received has been incredible and I have been extremely humbled by the enormous amount of support you have given me.
"I now have a lot to do to earn back your trust."
Cricket Australia last month suspended Smith and team vice-captain David Warner from all international and domestic cricket for a year, while Cameron Bancroft was suspended for nine months.
Bancroft was caught by TV cameras trying to tamper with the ball using sandpaper, triggering a dramatic series of events that led to the banning of the three players and coach Darren Lehmann standing down from his role.
Smith was greeted back by Lehmann, who tweeted "welcome home mate" in response to the 28-year-old's post.
Former Test Justin Langer was Thursday appointed as Lehmann's successor in all three formats of the game. AFP
