Girl child egged on for future leadership
The Women and Child Affairs Ministry in collaboration with other institutions under the purview of the ministry, UN and NGOs have taken measures to minimize gender-specific challenges faced by women to encourage them to become tomorrows leaders, Women and Child Affairs Ministry Secretary Ashoka Alawatte said.
She was addressing the national ceremony to commemorate the International Day of the Girl Child at the BMICH, recently.
The Ministry Secretary stressed the importance of ensuring rights of young women.
He added that some of them have lost their rights and freedom due to religious and cultural barriers.
Child Protection Authority Chairman H. M. Abayaratne said young women should practice hard work to achieve their goals.
He stressed the importance of being disciplined, self-confident, and dedicated young women.
In 2012, the United Nations passed a resolution that named October 11 as a day when the global community stops and considers the issues impacting the lives of girls around the world.
The aims of the day are to highlight the needs and challenges girls face, while promoting girls empowerment and the fulfillment of their rights.

Journalists now enjoy freedom of expression
Journalists now enjoy freedom of expression. Earlier thugs came in white vans abducted and made them disappear, Chief Incumbent of the Vajiragiri Viharaya in Tangalle Ven. Mirisse Dhammawansa Thera said.
The Thera was addressing the 25th Annual General Meeting of the Hambantota Journalists' Association at the temple recently.
The Thera said the journalists today can criticise the government without fear. Many journalists in Hambantota have no special privileges or a high income, yet they do a laudable service for the country, the Thera said.
"The narcotic kingpins in the death row enjoy luxuries and they have modern equipment to direct underworld activities," the Thera said.
Ven. Dhammawansa Thera donated monetary gift to the Association and its treasurer Raja Waidyasekera received the gift. K.K. Dayasena was appointed the Chairman and William Wanniarachchi was appointed the secretary of the association.

Namal Kumara, not a PTFDP employee
The Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention (PTFDP) which functions under the Office of the President yesterday stated that Namal Kumara of the Anti Corruption Force was not an employee of theirs and has never been one.
PTFDP Director Dr. Samantha Kumara Kithalawarachchi releasing a statement to the media explained that despite Kumaras claims that he was hired by the PTFDP in 2015, he was only a volunteer who had joined one of their programmes among the many thousands around the country.
The PTFDP is a special project which functions under the direct supervision of the President and was launched in 2015 to curb the drug menace in the country.
Thereafter, the PTFDP; a multi stakeholder committee of experts was formed to run various drug prevention campaigns and programs around the country.
The statement explained that in order to promote their various programmes, applications for volunteers around the country were called for through the Divisional Secretariats in each region. Thus far 20,000 volunteers work in various drug prevention programs around the country.
Namal Kumara, a resident of Warakapola too had volunteered for the drug prevention programme in the past couple of years and worked in the Kegalle district, the statemenst added.
He is not an employee of the Presidential Secretariat and does not work in the Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention and a complaint has been made to the CID to investigate into whether he posed off as an employee in the above organisations to conduct any illegal activities, the statement further added.

Ranaviru Sevana begins producing artificial limbs
The Ranaviru Sevana state-of-the-art wellness centre for disabled War Heroes at Ragama, turned a new leaf on Army Day on Wednesday when it ceremonially commenced its workshop for the production of Prostheses and Orthotics, benefiting over 15,000 amputees and physically-handicapped Army War Heroes.
The establishment of the workshop, equipped with new machinery and equipment of international standards was brought to completion, under the initiative of Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake. He was supported by the President for financial patronage to realise this cause.
Accordingly, the President, lauding the heroic deeds of affected War Heroes, facilitated the approval for about Rs. 160 million for the project which included machinery and equipment to the value of about Rs. 80 million, according to Major General S. K. Thirunavukarasu, Director General, Directorate of Rehabilitation.
At the workshop, about 25 foreign trained Army technicians would manufacture and assemble artificial legs and limbs or prostheses upon the importation of required components. The construction of the workshop that cost about Rs. 80 million had been designed enabling amputees to get their worn out artificial devices repaired without seeking new replacements for a considerable period.
Battle-affected War Heroes would be benefitted by this project as they can learn to use artificial products in the correct manner during their stay in the place.
Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake attending the inauguration of the new complex, unveiled a plaque. The Chief Guest was also briefed on the workings of the machinery and equipment by unit heads.
Lieutenant General Senanayake thanked those who supported the project, including foreign-based companies.
This is a tribute paid to the heroic deeds of our War Heroes on this landmark day of the Army.
It will certainly boost the morale of physically-handicapped War Heroes until they are naturalized and returned to society as ordinary citizens. This facility, perhaps the best in the region, could be further expanded under phase 2 and 3 in the future to turn it to be a public venture to serve the country one day, the Commander said.
Major General S. K. Thirunavukarasu, Director General, Directorate of Rehabilitation explained how the new workshop saw its birth as an extension to the Ragama Ranaviru Sevana and acknowledged the support received from the Commander, Army Engineers, other agencies and philanthropists.
At present, 115 handicapped resident War Heroes undergo rehabilitation and recuperation at Ragama Ranaviru Sevana.
Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana, Deputy Chief of Staff and Senior Officers of the Army, with civil invitees were present.

Tagore auditorium designed by SEC
The State Engineering Corporation, in a letter to the Daily News, yesterday clarified that the Rabindranath Tagore Memorial Auditorium built using an Indian grant was designed by architects and engineers of the SEC and not by Geoffrey Bawa.
In the article published on the topic on October 10, it was mentioned that the building was designed by Geoffrey Bawa. The Daily News would like to highlight that the error was a result of a typographical mistake in the press release sent to the paper by the Indian High Commission.
The Indian High Commission too has clarified that the building was designed to conform to the design principles of Geoffrey Bawa and all credit should go to the SEC for it.

1968 Olympics, symbol of turbulent times, turn 50
MEXICO CITY, Friday - It was 1968, revolt and upheaval were sweeping the world, and the Olympic Games could hardly avoid being swept up, too.
Friday marks 50 years since the 1968 Olympics opened in Mexico City, bringing the worlds of sport and politics crashing together -- and broadcasting the collision live around the world on color television for the first time.
It was the year that Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated. A year of student protests that exploded in Berlin and Paris and spread around the world. The year the US began to truly question the Vietnam War, and the USSR crushed the Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia.
At the Olympics, it was the year of George Foreman, Mark Spitz, Dick Fosbury and his famous Fosbury Flop, Tommie Smith and John Carlos with their iconic Black Power salute -- and so many more.
As the Games approached, the winds of change were blowing in Mexico, too.
Capitalizing on the international attention, student protesters took to the streets to call for democratic change after four decades of one-party rule.
We dont want the Olympics, we want a revolution! was one of the slogans they chanted.
The turmoil alarmed President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) as they readied Latin Americas first Olympics.
On the night of October 2, 10 days before the opening ceremony, army troops opened fire on 8,000 peaceful demonstrators in the Plaza of Three Cultures, in the Tlatelolco neighborhood of Mexico City.
Independent reports say anywhere from 300 to 500 people were killed.
POWERFUL PLATFORM
Hushed up by the Mexican government, which put the death toll at just 20, the massacre is little-remembered abroad.
But it was certainly noticed by the generation of young, politicized athletes making their way to Mexico City, including talented African American sprinters Smith and Carlos.
They have both cited the bloody crack-down as one of the influences for what they did next.
Four days into the Olympics, Smith won gold in the mens 200m, becoming the first person to run the race in under 20 seconds, as Carlos, his compatriot, claimed bronze.
On the podium, the pair thrust their black-gloved fists into the air as the national anthem played, a defiant protest against racism in the United States and human rights violations everywhere.
I came to Mexico City to make a statement. Not to win medals, Carlos said on a recent visit to Mexico City.
But the president of the International Olympic Committee, Avery Brundage, saw to it the men paid a heavy price: they were suspended from the Olympic team and sent home.
RECORDS SHATTERED
Their former teammate Wyomia Tyus, who won gold in the womens 100m and 4x100m -- publicly dedicating the latter to Smith and Carlos -- said the Olympic Village was electrified by the politically charged climate of the time.
There was so much unrest going on in the world that we all had to pay attention to it, she said after recently returning to the Olympic stadium for the first time.
The only way to help people was by speaking up or doing something. We had a platform where that could happen, and the world could see, added Tyus, who, like Smith and Carlos, was active in the movement known as the Olympic Project for Human Rights.
Other protests included that by Czechoslovakian gymnast Vera Caslavska, who won silver in the floor exercise and defiantly bowed her head as the Soviet anthem played for gold medalist Larisa Petrik -- recalling how Moscows tanks had crushed her countrys nascent opening.
They were the first Olympics where a woman lit the torch -- Mexican sprinter Enriqueta Basilio -- the first where East and West Germany competed separately, the first broadcast in color.
But the Games were also stunning as pure sport.
Mexico Citys high altitude -- 2,300 meters (7,545 feet) -- led to scores of broken records in the thin air: 30 world records and 76 Olympic records.
The most impressive may be American Bob Beamons 8.9-meter long jump -- still an Olympic record.
Or perhaps it was his compatriot Fosburys 2.24-meter high jump, using the backward technique that was mocked at the time -- but revolutionized the sport.

## Section: Features

A Zero Hunger World by 2030, Theme World Food Day 2018:
Is this an achievable aim
The global population today is calculated as 7.2 billion. To feed this number at the recommended 500 g (2150 kilo calories) of food per person per day, 2.16 billion tons of food are required annually. Of the amount required, cereals comprise half, which amount to a requirement of 1.08 billion tons. The world produces nearly 3.3 billion tons of food annually and one third of this is wasted, that is, 1.3 billion tons that never get eaten. Food loss and waste amounts to about $680 billion in industrialized countries and $310 billion in developing countries, according to the U.N. Every year, consumers in wealthy nations waste almost as much food (222 million tons) as the entire net food production of sub-Saharan Africa (230 million tons). Food discarded in Europe could feed 200 million people.
Therefore the dilemma that is faced by the hungry themselves, the farmers who continue to be poor, women who are unseen agricultural workers, the traders and decision makers is; why do 825 million go to bed hungry Why do 3.1 million children die of malnutrition and starvation each year Why are quarter of the worlds population malnourished even those who are not obviously hungry
In Sri Lanka too, 25% are malnourished, with a double burden of over and under nutrition. A majority of the population consumes only 80% of the calorie requirement. Only 35% of children under 5 receive a minimum acceptable diet. One in six of these young children are either too short for their age or too thin. At least 25% of women in urban areas are overweight. A 10 year plan that is proposed to assure food security falls on deaf years.
Right mix of nutritious foods
Therefore the simple argument in this morass of numbers is why should we talk about 2030 People should not go hungry now as the resources are available not only to fill hungry stomachs and alleviate hunger pangs, but to have the right mix of nutritious foods. All peoples of the world have a RIGHT to ingest proper food. In fact, many countries explicitly include the right to food in their constitution. In accordance, food should be made available at an affordable price or food assistance should be provided for those who are vulnerable.
Solutions to alleviate hunger and malnutrition cannot be provided without addressing terminology, looking at statistics and the causes for this unconscionable situation.
According to the Food and Agriculture Organizations latest definition; Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food which meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life. The same agency defines hunger as undernourishment and refers to the proportion of the population whose dietary energy consumption is less than a pre-determined threshold. Dietary energy supplies in a quantity not to feel hunger does not mean that total nutrition requirements are met. Another step forward to impactful programming in improved nutrition is to assure nutrition security which is the assurance that all essential nutrients are included, available and food is prepared in a form that can be eaten easily.
Hunger is the most basic level of food requirement. 825 million going to bed hungry means that the cheapest staples are either not available close at hand nor affordable. Sometimes it may mean that these staples are affordable, available but cannot be prepared for eating. Nearly 1.7 billion having an incomplete nutrient profile implies that dietary diversity or all food groups in all splendid colours are not included in the diet though staples are consumed. If nutrition security is not met by these 1.7 billion it also means that fruit, vegetables, green and animal products are not available or are too expensive to consume. Yet another reason is the lack of knowledge or the wrong kind of food related behaviour practice d for generations.
Natural disasters
The solutions that need to be worked out are many and varied. Solutions depend on the context and correct design for takeoff. Actions require an enabling environment to be created. For example; it is difficult to assure nutrition security in Syria when millions are displaced, without proper housing and kitchens to prepare food. Those who prepare food are traumatized, proper meals cannot be prepared in such circumstances This also happens during natural disasters.
Possible solutions are described briefly.
r Formulate a global food balance sheet taking into consideration the demographic profile of the people of the whole world and actual biological needs. These needs change according to stages of life, activity levels, weather conditions, migration and meal patterns. As an example it would be prudent if countries that have a winter season programme for their peoples varying energy needs. This would save food in one season and be used in the other on a basis of calculation than the old adage common sense approach of saving for winter. How much exactly does a country have to save up for winter
Piece meal approaches of countries over producing or the reverse will be prevented as ready markets for excess can be identified. Match this with national food balance sheets and ascertain gaps. This could be regionally balanced to manage cost of transport, perishability, palatability etc. Therefore countries can manage, trade and distribute the food they have more effectively. Plans for food security should be done for decades rather than three or five years. A longer term view can save resources and programme investment more wisely. As mentioned above the 200 billion tons wasted by Europe could be purchased at a reasonable price by Africa. Leaving the food trade to the mercies of market forces cannot resolve the hunger issue of the world. Any way why is such and excess of food produced
r Map pockets of vulnerability to natural disasters, poverty etc. The Vulnerability Assessment Mapping (VAM) of the World Food Program should be done at scale so that counting of vulnerable people can be done sub regionally, nationally, regionally and globally. The causes of vulnerability to food insecurity can also be ascertained with VAM methodology, with suitable solutions activated. Imagine that 42 million people in the US face hunger! These should be included in the global and regional VAM map.
r Richer countries that can afford, should facilitate buffer food stocks and agricultural inputs against disasters in poorer countries. This provides a cost effective approach rather than wait for a disaster, making the emergency response quite expensive. Of course the development agencies in this sector now have gone into resilience building mode to buffer and strengthen vulnerable communities against shocks and climate change. However this has to be a long term investment with consistent and concerted action that goes beyond three years of relief and recovery operations and even five years of a country programme. Such programs must result in resilient behaviours of vulnerable groups. Such change requires at least 10 years of work in a community.
r In reducing hunger and malnutrition the sensible way is to give a person a rod to fish rather than give his dinner is appropriate for all times. In many countries of the developing world livelihood development is done sporadically, with gaps in the package of inputs required. Market integration is poor with weak infrastructure and knowledge of markets. The poor produce goods that have no markets and are in more trouble than before, which severely compromises their food intake which is the first coping strategy. Livelihood programmes should be properly planned and calculated and implemented with rigorous monitoring.
r Agricultural productivity is the pivotal factor in the pricing of food, which determines food and nutrient intake to a great extent. What is the cost of a calorie or a gram of food There are many issues of land degradation because of over or wrong use of the land. The improper use of chemicals is another issue. This not only kills pests, but also people, leaving many families without a breadwinner. Chemicals are expensive especially when over used. There should be a debunking of the myth programme to alleviate the fear of organic farming. Multinational chemical companies spreading these myths of low organic productivity should be taken before the law and punished. Poor countries where these poisons are off loaded should regulate the use of such chemicals and reduce usage gradually. Water availability and the lack of water conserving agricultural techniques being implemented to scale, is a major cause of low productivity as well. Israel provides best practices for the whole world on greening the desert with highly sophisticated irrigation methods. Cuba offers lessons in organic farming, especially urban gardening programmes. Cuba is a zero malnutrition country.
r Closely intertwined with less productivity is the marginalization of women and the vast gaps in allocation of resources to facilitate their role in improving agricultural productivity. More productivity of the land will result in reduction of poverty and increase the empowerment of women. With half the population holding up the sky, not owning land, with the resultant lack of access to irrigation water, credit and agricultural inputs and subsidies, hunger cannot be reduced. Women get half the pay compared to men as agricultural labourers. Womens labour force participation is much less than men. Women have approximately, 1/10th to 1/8th access to technological knowhow and ownership of machinery. The role of women and their access to resources needs to be seriously redressed if the world is to see an end to hunger.
r Food and nutrition related behaviour changes are a pre-requisite to reducing hunger and malnutrition. Changes are necessary in preparing meals that have a good mix or diversity. Prudent purchasing and being thrifty is a must to manage household income. Using as much fresh food as possible, ingested raw, for best impact thus reducing the intake of processed food which is prepared energy intensively should be internalized. Processed food also has a large amount of salt, sugar and fat. There has been a logarithmic increase in overweight with the sharp rise in processed food consumption, especially among children, who are very often from more affluent families. So while some consume more food than required, on the other side of the scale there is under nutrition. In the same household that has over and under nutrition, both suffer from hidden hunger of micronutrient deficiency, due to lack of dietary diversity. Countries of the world must have comprehensive approaches to behaviour change, reinforced by media, interpersonal communication, development of cooking skills and meal planning. Food waste related behaviour should be improved and made punishable by law if not complied, especially in relation to food service.
In conclusion, unless there is a comprehensive approach, supported by bold steps, altruism in sacrificing profit at least to a certain extent, changes in attitudes and knowledge, sincere commitment by politicians especially of the super powers and hard work of bureaucrats, the private sector and the people ourselves, ending hunger cannot be a reality at any time.

AFC allows fourth substitution in extra-time at 2019 Asian Cup
DUBAI, Friday - Teams will be allowed to make a fourth substitution if their matches go into extra-time during next years Asian Cup finals, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) said on Friday.
Soccers law-making body, International Football Association Board (IFAB), earlier this year approved the use of a fourth substitute during extra time and the rule proved to be a success during the World Cup in Russia.
The entire continent is eagerly awaiting Asias most prestigious tournament and it is, therefore, essential that the AFC Asian Cup adopts the latest regulations, AFC president Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa said in a statement.
I am confident it will add to the excitement of Asias flagship national team competition and further strengthen the AFCs ambitions to be the worlds leading confederation.
The regional governing body said the new regulations will also be in place during this months AFC under-19 championship in Indonesia as well as next years AFC under-19 womens championship and the 2020 AFC under-23 championship.
Last month, AFC said it would introduce the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system at the Asian Cup.
The extended 2019 Asian Cup will see 24 teams taking part for the first time, up from the 16 that competed in the last four editions. The tournament kicks off in the United Arab Emirates on Jan. 5.

Australias Hastings puts career on hold due to lung condition
SYDNEY, Friday - Former Australia all-rounder John Hastings will stop playing cricket indefinitely to battle a medical condition that causes his lungs to bleed every time he bowls and could potentially kill him, the 32-year-old said on Friday.
Hastings, who signed for the Sydney Sixers in May but will not play in the Big Bash League this season, said he had endured a difficult period over the last few months as doctors were still unable to diagnose the problem.
Every time Ive been trying to gear up and get ready to bowl, Ive been coughing up blood. I wont be able to bowl this year or probably moving forward unless this situation gets sorted out, Hastings told RSNs the Breakfast Club.
Its just something that they cant say, look, youre not going to have a fatal bleed on the field or its not going to cause long-term damage... at this stage, unless something miraculous happens, I wont be able to bowl.
Hastings played one test match, 29 one-day internationals and nine Twenty20 matches for Australia before his retirement from international cricket in 2017.
The all-rounder said the condition, which first surfaced years ago but worsened this year, had left him shattered as it did not affect him during activities like boxing and rowing.
Ive come to terms with it now, but over the last four or five months its been a very tough period, Hastings added.
Ive played this game my whole life and I wanted to keep playing it. I wanted to play tournaments all around the world.
Thats one of the reasons I retired early from one-day and four-day cricket. To see it maybe slipping away, its tough to take.

Becoming security conscious
The word security brings to mind armed military units in the streets, guns and barricades, soldiers and war in a country where war existed in a near past. It is natural in a land where several generations have had guns and bombs in-their-faces almost every day. It should bring to the mind at literally and figuratively the problem of political prisoners. Natural also in a world that has become small due to communication technology and therefore has war delivered to the front door so to speak, hence political prisoner is an entity known to everybody or obtained or learned in daily conversation. On the other hand, it is not surprising that national security has mostly been associated with the protection of the regime or rather the incumbent government, even though it is frequently associated with the people and the nation. Media creates much such pseudo equableness. So what is security in general
Language experts tell us the word comes from the Latin Securus meaning free from care and evolved through the Latin word Securita and the Old French Securite to Secure in English and also Security; so the dictionaries tell us. Essentially it refers in general to a state of being secure and free of worry. Now this could be private or public. Certainly is not just about protecting territory, from armed attack from within or without. It is about obtaining and protecting a law abiding, well behaved all citizens.
Safety of people and property
It offers a dimension that opens us to all sectors: education, health, nutrition, environment, sustainability and basic freedoms even as it speak to national boundaries and resources or the general safety of people and property.
If we were to take a comprehensive view of things, in the world dominated by the western world led by America then we would have to conclude that insecurity is sadly a constant; well, at least into the foreseeable future. There are imponderables (e.g. the price of oil, the maverick and destructive nature of US foreign policy and military prerogatives, trade wars and a development model that pays lip service and nothing more to the health of the planet).
Lanka is a prisoner of agreements that contravene interest of ruling groups, but were signed under duress of HR campaigns or out of ignorance. On the other hand such leaders swallowed the development lie, compromised food security, and sneered at technologies that were developed over centuries. They placed trust on crooks, brigands, murderers, and such to run state affairs, and played a key part in the sustained development of impoverishment on all fronts.
Through fascistic rule people have collectively refused to recognize the greatest insecurity of them all: that which is resident in their minds and prevents them from recognizing resources and potentials. Instead masses allowed others to imprint in own consciousness other versions of realities. Security is not only about the right now and certainly not about protecting the lifestyles and positions of privilege of the few. It is not about safeguarding systems made to rob, cheat, hoodwink, insult, humiliate and impoverish people. A war situation understandably pushes a lot of these issues to the back-burner, but even in such situations these cannot be forgotten. Perhaps the tragedy has been that even when war was not a problem, these matters are not considered important. One American has said your (Sri Lankas) food security lies in the wheat fields of North America. USAID was essentially writing the countrys agricultural policy at the time.
Political prisoners
That is, the USA doing what is in her interest. The tragedy is that Lankans have been happy to just tag along; not just in the agriculture sector but the overall paradigm of development which is essentially a recipe for continued underdevelopment and maldevelopment.
National security is above all intelligence. Yes, more than military hardware. National security means nothing if food security is ignored or compromised, if theres no security against climate change. On the other hand National security is a failure if the dignity and self-respect of all citizens is not assured. Peoples security is nothing if people have to second guess themselves before expressing opinions, nothing if people cannot live the lifestyles that give them meaning, nothing if laws and regulations can be bent by the powerful. Personnel security is nothing if institutions encourage wrongdoing and systems offer refuge to wrongdoers.
National security, most importantly, is bound to equality, autonomy and self determination of nationalities involved. Otherwise, will be a grotesque proposition if theres no discussion and agreement on what nation really means.
Also it will be a source of political prisoners!

A tense situation was reported at Newstead Girls College in Negombo last morning with a bomb scare after a telephone call received by the Principal.
The incident took place around 8.00 am and the school authorities had immediately assembled all students to the school playground and informed the police.
The Police Crime Division along with the Army, STF and the Bomb Disposal Unit conducted a search operation with sniffing dogs by 8.30 am.
However the call turned out to be a hoax with nothing harmful found in the six-hour long operation.
The police and school authorities believe that this might have been done to disrupt the prize awarding ceremony to be held yesterday.

Cancer-hit badminton ace shelves appearance to focus on recovery
KUALA LUMPUR, Friday : Malaysian badminton star Lee Chong Wei has shown he's a "true fighter" after treatment for nose cancer but he has put public appearances on hold to focus on his recovery, a senior official told AFP on Friday.
Badminton Association of Malaysia president Norza Zakaria said the former world number one is looking well despite losing about five kilos (11 lbs) in weight while undergoing "tough" chemotherapy and proton therapy in Taiwan.
Lee had flagged a media appearance "a few days" after his return to Malaysia on Sunday, but Norza said the 35-year-old needed to rest to strengthen his immune system.
"Lee is a true fighter. He is in incredible spirit. He was extremely cheerful and jovial," he said.
"Lee shared with me his experiences during treatment and told me that his chemotherapy and proton therapy was tough."
Norza said he had breakfast with Lee on Thursday, where the player consumed soup. He said Lee looked better since his return to Malaysia.
"Lee has lost some weight, maybe four to five kilogrammes, but he is looking good," he said.
Last month, BAM announced that the three-time Olympic silver medallist was diagnosed with early-stage nose cancer.
BAM had said in July that Lee was suffering from a respiratory-related disorder and was pulling out of the World Championships and Asian Games.
Lee is Malaysia's top sports star after his long run of success at badminton's highest levels, despite his oft-lamented failure to win a world or Olympic title.
But Norza said he told the three-time Olympic silver medallist to recuperate and not to think about his future in the sport.
"I told Lee, we can sit and talk about the future of his badminton career in the next three weeks and I told him all Malaysians are praying for his speedy recovery," the badminton chief said.
Lee is currently ranked fifth in the world, after fighting his way back to prominence following his return from a doping ban in 2015.
Lee tested positive for a banned anti-inflammatory drug at the 2014 World Championships, an incident which many feared would end his career.  AFP

Chases runs boost West Indies in second Test against India
HYDERABAD Oct 12: Roston Chase hit an unbeaten 98 Friday to give the West Indies hope of setting a challenging total as they battle to level their Test series against India.
The tourists were 295 for seven at stumps after electing to bat first in the second and final Test in Hyderabad.
West Indies at times looked in trouble but Chase built crucial partnerships, including a 104-run seventh-wicket stand with skipper Jason Holder, who made 52. Chase was accompanied by Devendra Bishoo, on two, at the close of play.
Bishoo can score runs and keep his wicket intact. Ideally youd look at the magic number of 400 in the first innings, said West Indies coach Stuart Law.
350, 400 will be ideal for us and obviously the new ball with Shannon Gabriel, with his express pace, and Jason Holder back with his bounce and swing, we can get early breakthroughs and expose the middle order of India and put them under pressure. But Law acknowledged that his team will have to work our socks off to get to 350.
Holder made a strong return after missing the opening defeat in Rajkot with an ankle injury, hitting his eighth Test fifty.
The second new ball did the trick for India as paceman Umesh Yadav got Holder caught behind on a rising delivery.
Umesh and spinner Kuldeep Yadav claimed three wickets each to rattle the West Indies middle order as the tourists slipped to 113-5 and then 182-6.
But Chase kept his calm to counter attack with wicketkeeper-batsman Shane Dowrich in a 69-run sixth-wicket stand, as skipper Virat Kohli mixed and matched the Indian bowlers.
Umesh finally broke the partnership by trapping Dowrich lbw for 30.
Chase got to his seventh Test fifty just before tea and is on course for his fourth Test century. His highest Test score of 137 not out came against India in Jamaica in 2016.
I think he understands spin. They face a lot of spin back in the Caribbean in domestic cricket, said Law.
He has got a long reach, he takes half a stride and is there to the length of the crease. He uses that to his advantage, he is a clean striker of the ball. India are a bowler short after debutant paceman Shardul Thakur suffered a groin injury in his second over and limped back to the pavilion. He was sent for scans and did not return to field.
Had Shardul been there, it would have been more help for the spinners. Like I got three wickets and if he could have chipped in with a couple, said Umesh.
Actually when you are bowling with one fast bowler and three spinners, you finish overs quickly so the idea was to slow down the pace of the game a little bit, he added.
The morning session saw a fan run onto the field and embrace Kohli, who was clearly upset. The fan tried to plant a kiss on his cheek and take a selfie.
Security officers overpowered the youngster and hauled him off the field as the crowd roared and clapped. AFP

Sri Lanka-England 2nd ODI today
Dananjaya holds the key for Sri Lanka
DAMBULLA, Friday  Akila Dananjaya is a key component in Sri Lankas bowling line-up where with the number of variations he has up his sleeve he can spin his team to victory.
But even for a bowler of Dananjayas talent to be successful Sri Lanka must make sure they put a decent total on the board for the bowlers to challenge the opposition.
The absence of such totals will only make Dananjayas bowling ineffective as he will be bowling largely to run saving fields rather than attacking ones that would bring him a bag of wickets and put his team on the victory trail.
England had faced Dananjaya only once before the start of the ODI series in a T20I at Pallekele six years ago when he took two wickets for 2 wickets for 26 runs and subjected them to a 19-run defeat.
In the rain-truncated first ODI at Dambulla on Wednesday, Dananjaya conceded 30 runs in his five overs for the wicket of Jason Roy.
England knowing Dananjayas capabilities will surely target him and try to see him out of the attack by going after his bowling as did Jonny Bairstow who hit him for a six and a four.
Mental strength is really important for a spinner. When a batsman hits a boundary, youve got to work out if hes hit a bad ball, or whether hes hit a good ball. If youve just bowled a bad ball, theres no need to change the plan. Working that out makes it much easier to have a good strategy, said Dananjaya.
With modern day batsmen employing the sweep and reverse sweep consistently against spinners Dananjayas reply to that was: I dont try anything too fancy in the match, I try to stay within my game and execute the same sorts of things that I do at training. Sometimes I do get a feeling about how a batsman is going to play me, and I then will maybe change my approach and try something different. Ill just try a slightly different tack to put pressure on the batsman.
Dananjaya said that if Sri Lanka can keep England down to about 275 or less they would have done well as a bowling unit. He however sidestepped the question when asked why Sri Lanka played only five specialist batsmen in the first ODI by saying: Thats a question for the selectors and coach.
Sri Lanka whos batting has been rather wonky in ODIs need to strengthen their batting instead of sticking to five specialist batsmen and two all-rounders as they did for the first ODI if they are to compete with a strong England one-day unit that is oozing with confidence having defeated India 2-1 in the ODI series played in England.
The way England got about the Lankan bowling in the first 15 overs of the rain affected first ODI scoring at slightly over six runs an over gave a hint of what they are capable of. Their batting runs very deep to no. 9 where their third spinner Liam Dawson has opened the batting for Hampshire in recent times in red ball cricket.
The past two days have been bright and sunny with not a drop of rain and it is hoped that it will remain that way for today as well for the day game where being a Saturday a good turnout can be expected.

Federer battles past Bautista Agut in Shanghai
SHANGHAI, Thursday - Twice Shanghai Masters champion Roger Federer was far from his best against Spains Roberto Bautista Agut but did enough to reach the quarter-finals with a 6-3 2-6 6-4 win on Thursday.
The top-seeded Swiss, who is fighting to defend the title and his world number two spot, broke in the fourth game and sealed the opening set with a crisp backhand volley.
But Bautista Agut, the 2016 finalist, was back on song in the second set and won four straight games before forcing a decider courtesy a stunning backhand return.
Having lost a set for the first time in eight meetings with Bautista Agut, Federer cut down his errors before breaking in the ninth game en route to his 38th match win of the season.
In the last four the 37-year-old will face eighth-seeded Japanese Kei Nishikori, who knocked out big-serving American Sam Querrey 7-6(7) 6-4.
Wimbledon and U.S. Open champion Novak Djokovic exacted revenge over Italian Marco Cecchinato with a 6-4 6-0 victory.
AGGRESSIVE DJOKOVIC
The 31-year-old Serb is now unbeaten in 15 matches on the ATP tour and has won 28 of 30 matches since losing to then world number 72 Cecchinato in the French Open quarter-finals in June.
I was making him play always an extra shot, Djokovic said. I was aggressive when I needed to be. The second set was perfect, really.
I wanted to start off well because I know that he battles hard and he makes you deserve every point, win every point.
Seventh-seeded Wimbledon finalist Kevin Anderson awaits Djokovic in the quarter-finals after the South African overcame Greek youngster Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4 7-6(1).
Fourth seed Alexander Zverev raced past Australian number one Alex de Minaur 6-1 6-4 to improve his match record to 48-15 for the season.
With a dominant serve and a mix of clever groundstrokes, Zverev moved just one match win away from qualifying for the ATP Finals for a second consecutive year.
The German will next face 11th-seeded Briton Kyle Edmund, who produced a clinical performance to beat Nicolas Jarry of Chile 7-6(5) 6-3 in 90 minutes.

Five of the best Test matches ever played
It is said that the Test cricket is the most difficult form of cricket. A victory in Test cricket victory is savored much more than any victory in limited overs cricket. For any cricket, the longest format of the game is held in the highest esteem as that is the format in which one's technique, grit, and composure are tested. Wearing the whites of one's country remains the ultimate dream for any cricketer.
Here, we discuss some of the greatest test matches ever played across the world. While there have been plenty of incredible test matches over the years but great care was taken to list five best matches which took in some thrilling performances and nail-biting finishes. The five games which made this list are as follows:
1. INDIA BEAT AUSTRALIA BY 171 RUNS  KOLKATA, 2001
Score- Australia- 445 & 212; India -171 & 657/7
The second test in Kolkata of Australias series against India in 2001 was Test cricket at its best and one of the greatest test matches of all time. It is ranked higher due to its surprising result at the end. In Kolkata, the contest was between two good teams. It was the third case in Test match history that the side following on had won.
Australia batted first and hit 445 with a brilliant 110 by Steve Waugh which lifted Australia from 256 for 8 to 445. For India, it was Harbhajan who took 7 for 123 in 37.5 overs and became the first bowler in the 69 years of Indian Test cricket to achieve a hat-trick. Australia looked well set for their 17th consecutive test win when they dismissed India for a relatively low total of 171 in the first innings.
In the follow-on, India replied 115 for 3 before VVS Laxman came to bat. He scored one of the greatest knocks of all time with a brilliant 281 run and shared a superb stand of 376 with Rahul Dravid. India declared the innings at 657 for 7. Chasing the target of 384, Australia were dismissed for 212 with off-spinner Harbhajan Singh taking six for 73.
2. ENGLAND BEAT AUSTRALIA BY 18 RUNS  HEADINGLY, 1981
Score- Australia 401 & 111; England 174 & 356
As per many cricket experts, this is the greatest test match of all time. The series is simply dubbed as Ian Bothams Ashes. This was just the second time in Test match history that the side following on had won. At the point when Ian Botham landed to bat in Englands second innings, they were five wickets down and still 122 runs behind.
England lost their next two wickets in quick successions and it looked all over for them. Only then came an awesome inning from Ian Botham (149 not out from 148 balls with 27 fours and a six), aided by a fine fifty from Graham Dilley. The pair put a rapid 117 run partnership for the 8th wicket. Chasing the target of 130, Australia was cruising at 56 for one. Then an astonishing spell of 8-43 by Bob Willis shattered the Australian innings for 111.
3. SOUTH AFRICA LOST TO ENGLAND ON THE VERY LAST BALL OF THE MATCH  DURBAN, 1948
Score- South Africa 161 & 219; England 253 & 128
Chasing a target of 128 from 28 overs, England was 126 for 8 at the end of 27.5 overs. With three balls left any one of four results remained possible. Alec Bedser was on strike with Cliff Gladwin at the non-striker's end. Bedser leveled the score with a single and changed the end. Gladwin missed the second ball.
Afterward, in a deep conversation, he and Bedser decided to race in any outcome except the wicket being hit. As the bowler commenced his run-up, all the South African fielders ran towards the wicket to prevent the single which would win the match. Gladwin swung his bat, but again missed his stroke and the ball struck his thigh and bounced a yard or two in front of him. Before the fielder from the short leg picked the ball, both the batsmen changed their end. A drama came to an end.
4. WEST INDIES BEAT AUSTRALIA BY ONE WICKET, BARBADOS, 1998-99
Score- Australia 490 & 146; West Indies 329 & 311
Brian Laras unbeaten 153 against Australia in Bridgetown is generally and legitimately viewed as the best innings in a run chase of Test cricket. Australia scored 490 in the first innings with the assistance of a splendid 199 innings by Steve Waugh. Chasing the target West Indies were 98 for 6 before a 7th wicket partnership of 153 between Sherwin Campbell and Ridley Jacobs took West Indies into a formidable position.
The next day, West Indies continued their dominance by bowling the Australians out for 146, leaving a target of 308 for victory. When three wickets lost, it appeared the cause was lost for the West Indians. West Indies position kept on deteriorating on Day Five till they were 105 for 5. Now Lara made his move, he produced one of the greatest knocks to overcome the mighty Australians. Finally, West Indies Won by 1 wicket as Wisden put it, he had guided his team to victory as though leading the infirm through a maze. It was only the fourth time West Indies had scored more than 300 to win a Test match. Steve Waugh himself described it as one of the Greatest Test Matches he had ever played in.
5. SRI LANKA BEAT ENGLAND ON THE SECOND LAST BALL OF THE MATCH  LEEDS, 2014
Score- Sri Lanka 257 & 457; England 365 & 249
After facing 122 deliveries for the 10th wicket, it was the second last ball from Eranga which prevailed over all the efforts that both Ali and Anderson brought out to save the match and gave Sri Lanka a memorable Test series victory. Anderson faced 55 balls over 81 minutes without scoring a single run and tried his best to save the match.
Moeen Ali scored a century in the second innings and got full backing from other English batsmen. At the point when the ninth wicket was down, it simply seemed like a formality for Anderson and Ali to play as many balls as they could. The match ended with a high profile drama and at last Sri Lanka won the match with just one ball left.  sportsk

Heartwarming gestures by sportsmen on the cricket field
Cricket is a fiercely competitive game in which every athlete steps on the field to win it. However, there are some deeds of sportsmanship which justifies the tag of gentlemens game.
On several occasions, cricketers proved why the spirit of the game is beyond everything, even winning the match. Such actions full of grit and gratitude manage to steal millions of hearts and, leave behind an everlasting memory. So lets have a look at some of the most heartwarming gestures by cricketers on the cricket field.
#5 Dhoni calls back Bell
During a match of the 1987 World Cup in Lahore, Sir Courtney Walsh chose to lose the match instead of running out a player in an unfair manner.
Pakistan required 13 runs in the last over to win the game against mighty West Indies, Walsh had already conceded 11 runs off the first five balls, now the equation was two runs off the final ball.
Courtney Walsh stopped, backed out in his delivery stride but didnt run out the non-striker who was way ahead of the crease. Next ball, Abdul Qadir scored the desired runs to win the match for Pakistan, but the grace of Walsh remains forever.
#4 Gracious Courtney Walsh

#3 Gilly walks off in a World Cup semi-final
Australian opener Adam Gilchrist walked off the field despite being given not out. It was the Semi-final of World Cup 2003, Gilchrist nicked a ball off leggie Arvind Desilva to be caught by the wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara.
The umpire rejected the appeal for caught behind but Gilchrist, being the true ambassador of the game, walked straight to the pavilion. Gilchrists act was lauded by fans and received a lot of appreciation from former players.
Aussies are known to be quite competitive and wont leave any stone unturned especially in a Semi-final of a World Cup, but Gilly showed respectable behavior and upheld the spirit of the game. Later on, the Aussies went on to win the game, but the hearts of the fans were already won.
#2 Team India waves Sri Lankan Flag
After defeating Bangladesh in the final of Nidahas Trophy, men in Blues thanked the Sri Lankan crowd for their support. After a controversial knock-out by Bangladesh on the other night, Sri Lankan fans were left with teary eyes.
Sri Lankan crowd turned hostile against the Bangladesh team and decided to support India in the final of Tri-series. India beat Bangladesh by four wickets in the last-ball thriller courtesy of a cameo from Dinesh Karthik.
Captain Rohit Sharma thanked the Sri Lankan crowd for the support and love they offered to the Indian team. He further led the boys to wave Sri Lankan flag around the ground.
#1 NZ pays tribute to late Phillip Hughes
The accidental demise of former Australian opener Phillip Hughes left whole cricket fraternity in dismal. The trend of #keepyoubatsout became a movement across the globe with fans and cricketers posting pictures of their bats out as a tribute to the deceased cricketer.
Another touching gesture was by New Zealand Mens Cricket Team. New Zealand was playing the second test of the series against Pakistan. The Kiwis needed to win the match to level the series, despite that they decided not to bowl bouncers in the match as they were taken aback by the on-field death of Phillip Hughes.
Even, Brendon McCullum and Kane Williamson did not celebrate their double-centuries. New Zealand players wore black bands with P.H. written on their jerseys.- sk

MP Hirunika Premachandra yesterday said she is planning to consult a lawyer to get more information from the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) with regard to the allegation levelled against her by some sections of the media claiming that she had taken Rs.20 million from the Maga Neguma account.
Without knowing the real facts behind this allegation, I cannot take any action. But, once I find the reason for those who make such false allegations, I will take a decision with regard to those who publicised this falsehoods, she added.
Some electronic and print media claimed that MP Hirunika had taken Rs.20 Million from the workers welfare account of the contract company involved in the Maga Neguma Programme and had used it for her political activities.
MP Premachandra, while totally denying this allegation at a media briefing held at Sirikotha yesterday,said that she is not aware about the reason for making such an allegation and that she has the ability to prove these allegations wrong.
As a young politician, I do not want to add a black mark to my political career by resorting to such cheap things. I had not even entered politics during the period of time mentioned in the allegation, she added.
Hirunikas name is mentioned in a bill issued for a sum of Rs. 243,000 during the said time period and she said that it is questionable as to how that amount has increased up to Rs. 20 Million.
Though the bills claim the equipment was ordered under my name along with another name, but at least my signature was not placed on this bill, she said.

Huge Wimbledon expansion one step closer
LONDON, Thursday - A huge expansion of the Wimbledon tennis championships which would transform the tournament and bring qualifying on-site moved a big step closer on Thursday after a local golf club decided all members would benefit equally from a proposed buyout.
Wimbledon Park Golf Club members voted by more than the necessary 75 per cent to amend their constitution. Now all members would benefit from the 65 million pound ($85.83 million) windfall, not just those of more than 10 years standing.
Under the All England tennis clubs buyout offer, the golfers will receive a reported 85,000 pounds ($112,285) each to sell the declining asset  the tennis club already owns the freehold to the land which would revert to the All England club in 2041 in any case.
The golfers are expected to vote on the offer before the end of the year.
Wimbledon wants to use the land - landscaped in the 18th Century by English landscape architect Capability Brown - to move qualifying on-site from its current location some three miles (5 km) away in Roehampton.
The whole experience of being at Wimbledon we think could be transformed, All England Club chairman Philip Brook said recently.
EYES WIDE OPEN
And this isnt about building new big stadia, its about a wonderful opportunity...tennis in an English garden.
We are not planning to build hotels, multi-storey car parks, a helipad, a shopping centre.
The aim was to move the qualifying event on-site, he said.
Most of the people who play qualifying lose and dont ever make it inside of the gates of SW19, and we think thats a shame, and were the only grand slam where that is the case. Bringing that event on-site would be fantastic.
Should the golfers accept the offer, then part of the land will become available to the tennis club at the end of 2021, and other parts available at a years notice.
The heritage of the land means it comes with numerous constraints, including some 40 trees which could never be moved, Brook said, adding that the club had already done initial work with external consultants who are familiar with Capability Brown land.
Were going into this eyes wide open in terms of that aspect of it. We are very interested in building grass tennis courts over there.  Agencies

Importance of fire safety
Fire is one of mans most important discoveries, yet it is also one of the most dangerous. Sayings such as you are playing with fire illustrate the dangers associated with fire. It can raze solid structures to the ground in a matter of hours and snuff out precious lives in a matter of minutes.
We pen these lines in the aftermath of the truly horrific fire at a popular clothing store in Pelawatte, which virtually paralyzed the area for the better part of the day on Thursday. The fire was so big that even an Air Force Bell 212 helicopter equipped with the bambi bucket had to be pressed into service. The only silver lining in the black smoke, so to speak, was the lack of any injuries to shop workers or consumers. Also, adjoining shops escaped with little or no damage. But sometimes fires can be really devastating  one example was the destruction of the Grenfell Tower in London last year with the loss of 80 lives.
We do not know the cause of the Pelawatte blaze yet  that is a job for the Police and fire investigators. But we do know how and why fires start in some buildings. The primary cause for the generation and spread of fire in buildings is bad design headlined by cost cutting. No building can be completely fireproof, but there are fundamental precautions that should be taken from the initial design stage itself.
First, there should be adequate ventilation and fire exits in any building. We have seen many buildings that can house hundreds but which have only one major exit. This can be extremely dangerous in an inferno. Moreover, there should be clear signposting on fire exits and emergency exit routes in every building. Fire resistant and retardant material must be used wherever and whenever possible in construction.
There should also be enough smoke detectors, water sprinklers, fire hydrants and water hoses that can contain a fire. Fire extinguishers are a must for every building, though we have seen many buildings which do not have them. Electricity leakages are another leading cause of fires. There should be a periodic inspection of the electricity wiring and connections at least once every six months in every building, regardless of its age. Arson  setting fire to a structure deliberately - can sometimes be a factor. Though it cannot be called arson, sometimes even a carelessly thrown cigarette butt can start a fire (there should be a strict no-smoking policy in high rise environments). It is also possible for LPG leakage to lead to a fire.
The leading cause of injury and death in a fire is often not burning per se  it is smoke inhalation, which sometimes immobilizes even physically fit victims who can otherwise find their way out. In many infernos, victims are also trapped inside by badly designed buildings that provide no easy exits until they are consumed by smoke and fire. The design of some buildings often makes it difficult for fire crews to reach certain areas to rescue victims. Fire safety is a must for any building, big or small. Every building, especially those coming up anew, must have the latest fire safety technologies and ample access for the exit of tenants and entry of fire crews.
In the light of the construction boom involving high rise condominiums sweeping Sri Lanka, the authorities must examine these structures and impose tougher conditions if they have failed to meet the minimum fire safety requirements required under Sri Lankan law. If our laws are not adequate at present to deal with these problems, new laws must be passed.
In most countries, it is obligatory for the owner to state how many persons can be accommodated in their building at any given time. This is essential, because any number exceeding the set limit will pose a massive danger to all in the event of a sudden evacuation. It is also essential for every city in Sri Lanka to have a 24/7 state-of-the-art firefighting fleet with advanced vehicles manned by qualified and trained professionals. There are new technologies such as fire dousing drones, the latest front in fighting high-rise fires and wildfires. Constant monitoring is the key to containing wildfires, which sometimes occur in Sri Lanka.
No matter how many latest technologies are used, there is a chance that fire could win. It is a never ending fight with a major force of nature that has the power to destroy everything in its path. Our best defence against fire is constant vigilance and the use of materials that could prevent it in the first place. It is also worth having knowledge of exactly what you should do if a fire erupts  this is why it is important for residential towers, malls and offices to conduct fire drills regularly. This way, residents and tenants have a greater chance of emerging alive when an actual fire strikes. No corners should be cut when it comes to fire prevention and safety. After all, one cannot measure precious lives in terms of money.

India spin test ideal for Bangladesh tour, says W. Indies coach
HYDERABAD Oct 12: West Indies coach Stuart Law Friday said his batsmen being tested against quality Indian spinners is ideal preparation for their upcoming tour of Bangladesh.
The Caribbean side are battling to level the two-match series against India with Roston Chase hitting an unbeaten 98 on day one of the second Test in Hyderabad.
The West Indies, who lost their opening game by an innings and 272 runs in Rajkot last week, will travel to Bangladesh for two Tests, three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches in November-December.
Coming to India we expect to play a lot of spin ... we are going to face lot of spin over there (as well), so its good the boys are getting a taste of spin here, Law told reporters in Hyderabad.
Its a great learning curve for us and we try and get the dirtiest and dustiest pitches to bat against them so we did learn how to play spin, added Law, who has decided to give up the West Indies job after the Bangladesh series.
The Jason Holder-led West Indies will play five ODIs and three T20 matches in India before heading off to Bangladesh.
Law praised the West Indies, who drubbed the touring Bangladesh side 2-0 in July during a successful home season, for their cricketing talent and a bright future.
The thing I have noticed at my time with the West Indies here is that there is lot of talent, not only in this team but also in the whole of cricket back in the Caribbean, said Law, who will coach English county side Middlesex from next season.
After brief stints in charge of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, the 49-year-old took over the Windies reins in January 2017 and led his team to a memorable Test victory over England at Headingley last summer.

Ireland's O'Brien retires from international cricket
Dublin, Friday: Ireland wicketkeeper-batsman Niall O'Brien announced on Friday that he is retiring from international and first-class cricket after a 16-year career.
The 36-year-old, who made his international debut against Denmark in 2002, played 216 times for Ireland and appeared in his nation's first-ever Test, against Pakistan, in May this year.
O'Brien opted for the number 72 shirt to mark his match-winning score in Ireland's famous win against Pakistan at the 2007 World Cup.
His county career included spells with Kent, Northamptonshire and Leicestershire.
"It is with a heavy heart that I am announcing my retirement from international and professional cricket," said O'Brien, who has played much of his career alongside his younger brother Kevin.
"I have been blessed to have been lucky enough to have represented my country for 16 years with plenty more ups than downs and for this I look back with nothing but smiles and laughter."
Cricket Ireland performance director Richard Holdsworth said O'Brien had been symbolic of the rise of Irish cricket.
"He has the distinction of being central to one of those truly iconic Irish sporting moments -- the World Cup win over Pakistan in 2007," he said.
"While he had many more achievements throughout his career subsequent to this, it is the part he played in that win that etched him into the Irish sporting psyche and something he should be justifiably proud of." AFP

Ladies College the new force in schools netball
Ladies College reached a milestone in their sporting history when they became runners-up in the recently concluded All Island School Games Netball tournament.
Brenda Rajapakse who is in charge of netball at Ladies College shares her views on the rise of netball at the school.
Q: What is the secret behind the success of netball at Ladies College
Brenda Rajapakse, MIC of netball at Ladies College
A: We always pray before and after our matches no matter what the result is. Our Principal Eesha Speldewinde has been a source of encouragement and strength supporting us all the way. The Teacher in Charge of Sports Kamala Kulatilake has helped us coordinate everything and is present at all the tournaments encouraging all of us. The same students participate in many other sports but with the arrival of coach Mr Deeptha Bandara who joined us in 2015 and with the support of coach Mrs. Pushpa Navaratne, the players showed more commitment and dedication towards the game. Practice schedules made by the coach Deeptha Bandara and playing many practice matches arranged by him, against other schools, sports clubs and specially practicing with the Sri Lanka Air Force netball team has helped us immensely, especially in developing the skills and confidence of all the players.
Q: Being an elite school in Colombo what are the barriers faced by netball in the past history
A: Especially having to play against some of the best schools in the island early at circuits and at zonal level and playing according to a knock-out format is a huge challenge for us. Also getting all the top players together for all 4 tournaments through the year was a tremendous challenge since they have exams and other sporting commitments locally and internationally. A lot of hard work was put in by these players and the coaches for many years.
Q: What are Ladies Colleges achievements in sports in the last couple of years
A: We as a private school have being performing well in the fields of tennis, athletics, swimming, water polo, rowing and many other sports individually as well as in team events. Performing well at the Circuits, Zonals,Western Province as well as All Island and in other private meets in netball was unusual but we really did well this year.
Q: Ladies College has good facilities than most other schools, why do you think its taken such a long time to enter the top level at netball and what is the reason for this dramatic turnaround
A: I personally think its the commitment of the coaches and the players because as Mr Deeptha joined us only in 2015 the players have showed great improvement by becoming champions in the Circuits and qualifying through Zonals and Provincials for the All Island.
It was a huge challenge for us to get through from the Western Province since only two teams finally get through from our province and both teams came to the All Island finals. As I said before playing according to a knock-out basis is really tough. More than the facilities I think its the new techniques, training and knowledge put in by the coach and the team being coordinated was the key to our success.
Q: What is the contribution the players and parents have made
A: The contribution put in by the players especially the ones who are in this particular team (under 18) I have no words to explain. We have most of the players who engage in other activities, such as Anika Seneviratne representing our school and in many International Tennis Tournaments.
She represented Sri Lanka in the Asian Games this year which took place during these tournaments and has also won the prestigious triple crown at the Sri Lanka Open Nationals in August just before the netball finals. She also represents the school at athletics. Sarisha Gunasekara took part in the Junior South Asian Games in the shot putt event and won the Bronze medal for her country, Sulani de Silva represented the school in hockey and water-polo (other than netball), Ovidini represented the school in basketball, Ganya Senanayake in athletics, Nuwangi Gunawardane in table tennis.
Bimanya is our shooter and a key member of the team. Ganya, Anika and Bimanya were selected for the National under 17 netball pool, but always attended school practices without any hesitation while they were selected and practiced at the junior netball development pool which played matches against the Singapore national team and a British club side. Although they had multiple practices to attend they gave their full dedication and commitment. All the players were right on the dot at 6.00 in the morning for their netball practices and fitness.
The parents too did their part and supported me in many ways throughout the years. During the school holidays they sacrificed all their personal commitments towards the success of their children and the school. A special thank you goes to them.
Q: How many players represented the Sri Lanka team from Ladies College
A: We havent had any players representing the Sri Lanka National netball team but we have had many players for the past many years representing the Sri Lanka Schools netball team for the Waverly International School netball tournament held annually in Australia. Three players Ganiya, Anika and Bimanya represented the under 17 national side this year.
Q: Your views on the school netball association and their contribution to the schools netball development.
A: The schools netball association has given its fullest support towards organizing many inter schools tournaments which has provided the opportunity for the students to participate in many tournaments. Through this they have given many opportunities for the players to develop their talents, skills and also to gain experience. The junior national squad is a good example.
Q: What are the future plans for the development of netball at Ladies College
A: We have already approached many youngsters to come in for practices in different age groups and are hoping to do some coaching camps for the players. Our main goal is to become overall champions at the Nationals. This performance as runners up has really helped make netball a popular sport in the school.
Q: Tell us something about Ladies College sports history
A: We have had many students representing the country for over 100 years. Damayanthi Darsha who is an old girl of Ladies College, her performances were exceptional in track events, many tennis players and swimmers represented the country and have excelled in many events and hold records in the sports field. Ladies College continues to support all sports equally and have always given their full backing to the national cause.

Lalith and Anushas appeals fixed for Oct. 19
Two Appeal petitions filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court to convict them over the Sil Redi distribution case were yesterday fixed for October 19 by the Court of Appeal.
When the matter came up before the Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench comprising Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli, the Registrar of Colombo High Court tendered in court the proceedings pertaining to the High Court trial.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to three-years-Rigorous Imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.

While handing out a lengthy judgment, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors have proven the accuseds guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015-Presidential Election.l
While observing a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs.50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused were further ordered to pay a fine of Rs.two million rupees in default of the payment of fine they will have to serve additional one year imprisonment.

They were found guilty of all charges.

Nuts and Bolt! Sprint legend grabs double after painful kick
Sydney, Friday: Sprint legend Usain Bolt scored his first goals in professional football Friday after starting up front in a pre-season game for Australias Central Coast Mariners.
The 100 metres world record-holder, who is bidding for a professional contract, recovered from a painful kick in the groin to grab a double against Macarthur South West United in Sydney.
Bolt, 32, finished with his left foot after some slack marking on 55 minutes, celebrating with his trademark Lightning Bolt pose.
The Jamaican then capitalised on a defensive mix-up to score his second on 69 minutes before being substituted six minutes later with the score at 4-0.
It was the first game Bolt has started since joining the A-League club in August for an indefinite trial.
Im just happy that I got a chance and Im proud of myself, Bolt told host broadcaster Fox Sports after the game.
It was a big deal... first start and scoring two goals. It was a good feeling. This is what I worked towards. I try to get better and I am on the way to doing that.
Bolt said he had a lot more to learn and was keen to join the Mariners on a professional contract.
Im keen, thats why Im here to play my best and to try and get into the team. AFP

Our record against spin is right up  there, says Joe Root
DAMBULLA, Friday  Dont expect England to struggle against Sri Lankas spinners as they have done in the past for the present team as Test captain Joe Root described is an all-round side with plenty of options to work on which has made them the no. 1 ranked ODI team in the world today.
I think we've certainly got it in us. There has been signs of that and as a team, our record against spin is right up there if not the best in the world over the last couple of years, said Root at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
This is another opportunity to show everyone how good we are against that and to perform well on these surfaces. To do that it's important to understand the rhythm of batting here is very different to back home. The way we structure setting a target or chasing one down might be very different to how we go about it at home, he said.
We've managed to do that very well in other places in the world where we've had success recently. It's just another opportunity to do that and to put some experience in the bank for the World Cup. Hopefully from tours like this we'll have had success in different conditions.
Root described the present England ODI team as a well rounded one with plenty of options. I think we are a very well rounded team with plenty of options in all departments, especially batting as deep as we do we give ourselves a good chance.
With this group I don't think it's skill-based, I think it's about reading the game, reading the situation and adapting quickly. Whether its rain taking time out of the game or the surface changing drastically over the course of a day/nighter or throughout the day, said Root.
The way we approach cricket in ODIs is very different since the last time we toured. There is a very different balance and make-up to the team, and the way those guys naturally play will always put bowlers under pressure, whether thats seam or spin. That can be challenging if you have guys that score in different areas it can be quite to control length.
Through a lot of hard work over the last three of four years, we have come a long way, but we still have a lot of developing and improving to do to be No. 1 in the world for a long time and to challenge in the World Cup. This is an opportunity to prove that against spin. Weve done it in the majority of places throughout the world, but can we do it here on spinning surfaces Root queried.
DANANJAYA LIKE KULDEEP
Root described Akila Dananjaya similar to Indias Kuldeep Yadav. Yeah, he's got a few skills. Definitely having faced the majority of the overs he bowled has helped with picking things up. He can turn the ball nicely both ways, I think he's got a googly as well so he's obviously a very talented bowler that looks to take wickets. You could tell that with the fields they set, they wanted to attack us and try to capitalise on the two early wickets.
Root said that every bowler youve never faced before is a mystery, because you dont know what youre going to get.
As a batter its very easy to build things up, to over-anticipate how things will go. Most importantly you have to play whats in front of you. A lot of times in the past, playing against quick guys like Mitchell Johnson you can build it up and think itll be even quicker, and then you can get out there and its a little bit easier. You can get yourself out by talking yourself out. Most importantly you prepare, watch the footage, see how they operate and go and play accordingly.
Its a talented attack, the Sri Lankan spin attack. They have some fine bowlers but we will have to play well against them to score big runs. Its about worrying about your own game, being clear about each bowler within that attack, Root said.

Mahatma Gandhi an example to the whole world, President Sirisena
During a time when certain groups are belittling the reconciliation process initiated by the government, Mahathma Gandhis legacy was a great example for true reconciliation, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
President Sirisena made these observations in Parliament yesterday, participating in the Special Adjournment debate on the Commemoration of the 150th Birth Anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
Speaking further, President Sirisena said that Mahathma Gandhi was an exemplary personality to the whole world.
When India gained independence, he urged that Pakistan should not be made a separate country. He was in tears as he requested Muhammad Ali Jinnah, not to ask for a separate country. But his request was not accepted. Now, look at the long prevailing Indo - Pakistani conflict. How much has it affected the economy of these two countries Look at the billions of money allocated by both these countries for security purposes. How many were killed President Sirisena pointed out.
President Sirisena also said that Mahatma Gandhi was not a politician, but a humanist who gathered and led all contemporary leaders with a non-violent approach.
Mahatma Gandhi led the people who were suppressed by British colonial rule towards independence, cherishing discipline, order, patience and love.
He was an example not only to our country, but to the entire world, President Sirisena observed.

Parliament commemoratesMahatma Gandhi : the Father of India
Parliament yesterday, took up a special Adjournment Debate to commemorate the 150th Birth Anniversary of the late Mahatma Gandhi, prominent political and spiritual leader of India.
The 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi is being commemorated as a global event starting from October 2.
The Adjournment Motion was moved by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh was present at the VIP gallery along with his diplomatic officers to listen to the debate.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at the commencement of the Adjournment Debate announced that Gandhis vision, based on truth and non-violence, is a guiding light for the entire world. Gandhi, who is remembered with great respect as the Father of India and Father of non-violence, spearheaded Indias independent movement based on truth and non-violence, said the Speaker.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe called Gandhi as an extra-ordinary political strategist who challenged the largest empire of the world through Satyagraha.
Gandhi realized that you have to mobilize the masses to free India and that you have to use legal framework as the tool, he added.
Wickremesinghe quoting Gandhis words, I can see that in the midst of death life persists, in the midst of untruth truth persists, in the midst of darkness light persists, went on to say that this was the confidence he gave the people of India, a confidence which others copied from the people of India as they struggled to win their freedom. Gandhi is shared by all of us.
Though he is known for leading the freedom struggle in India, his influence was such, that it immediately influenced the countries around India.
Swaraj meant not merely political independence, but self-sufficiency, the Premier said.
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, Party Leaders and members of both the Government and the Opposition, joined in the debate that continued for about half a day.

Amendments to Commissions of Inquiry Act to expedite judicial process:Minister Rajapakshe
The amendment to the Commissions of Inquiry Act intends to lower the duplicity of proceedings and expedite the judicial process, Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe yesterday said. With the amendment, the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act and the Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry Act would be brought to an equal level, he pointed out.
Minister Rajapakshe made these observations, opening the Second Reading of the Commission of Inquiry (Amendment) Bill yesterday.
He pointed out that the findings of a Presidential Commission of Inquiry are considered admissible evidence which leads to duplicity of proceedings when taking legal action. Even though the COI comes up with solid evidence in an inquiry, the Police have to conduct a separate inquiry from the beginning, when legal action is taken on the same case. This results in duplicity of proceedings, he said.
The Attorney General could take legal action based on the findings of a Special Presidential Commission of Inquiry. With this amendment, the same status would be given to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry as well. The only difference is that the person who could institute legal action is not the Attorney General, but the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, Minister Rajapakshe explained.
In reply to a question raised by JO MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena, Minister Rajapakshe observed that following these amendments, the Bribery Commission could take legal action based on the findings of the Treasury Bond Commission if the evidence collected by the Commission be adequate.
Minister Rajapakshe also said that experts would be recruited to the Bribery Commission for the first time in Sri Lanka. He said that countries such as Hong Kong, with a less population than Sri Lanka, has experts attached to their corruption fighting establishments whereas in Sri Lanka, there is not a single expert used for the same process.
The Minister also observed that the amendment to the Bribery Act is not satisfactory. He also pointed out that the Assets Laxatives Act should also be amended for which Cabinet approval has been granted. Rajapakshe also pointed out it that is of national interest that new laws be introduced to strengthen the anti-corruption establishments.
The current laws only cover bribery and corruption in the public sector. But we understand that there is bribery and corruption thriving in the private sector as well. We need to bring in new laws to curb bribery and corruption in the private sector. We dont have a law in reference to bribing in the guise of giving gifts or presents. There is no law on conflicts of interest or bribing foreign dealers. We need to bring in new laws covering all these sections he said.

Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm developmentMinister urges JVP not to hamper joint venture project
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga urged that the Governments endeavour to develop the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm by way of a joint venture project between the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Lanka Indian Oil Company (LIOC) not be hampered.
He requested the JVP not to spread falsehoods on the initiative to develop the Trincomalee oil storage facility which had been idling for years.
The minister was responding to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake on September 21.
The Minister said the upper tank farm comprising 85 tanks would be leased to a sub company formed jointly by the CPC and LIOC for development. Out of them 16 tanks would be handed over to the CPC by the sub company once the development work is over.
The period of the lease will be decided by Cabinet.
The agreement signed between the Sri Lankan Government and LIOC on February 7, 2003 would be cancelled with the signing of the new agreement.
The lower tank farm comprising 15 tanks, which are already being used by the IOC, would be given to the same company for a period determined by Cabinet.

PRESIDENT APPOINTS SENIOR MOST CAREER JUDGE AS CJ
President Maithripala Sirisena speaking at an event in Battaramulla said that he had inquired on the personal, professional and academic credentials of the justices serving in the Supreme Court.
He went on to state that the appointment must be based on seniority in service and that for the first time in 30 years, he would be appointing a Chief Justice based on seniority.
The Supreme Court judges met upon my return from Seychelles and urged me to nominate the most qualified and senior judge of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice. They said by doing so the career judges would nurse the confidence that they too will stand the chance of being appointed to the post sans undue influence, the President said.
The Constitutional Council has approved the nominee of President Maithripala Sirisena for the post of Chief Justice of Sri Lanka. The President had not submitted a list of names, instead he had nominated a judge who had served the judiciary unsullied for the last 38 years and who had also served as President of a Labour Tribunal. He is credited for having risen the ranks to now hold office in Sri Lankas apex court.
President Sirisena said that when a politician engages in misconduct, the image of other good politicians is damaged. The misconduct of a politician affects the images of other good politicians he said.

Quality assurance in Higher Education
In recent years, the role of students in the quality assurance of higher education has become recognized, across Europe, South East Asian countries as being both necessary and desirable. Students have increasingly become involved in the improvement and enhancement of their own learning experiences.
Whether it be through providing feedback on the programmes they have taken, contributing to the development of learning and teaching in their subject area, participating in university decision making processes, or representing student views in any number of ways through a student union or other representative body -students voices are today being heard loudly and clearly and, ever more often, their views are being taken seriously in many of the countries in Europe, South East Asia.
This article brings together a wide range of sources of evidence about the variety of types and levels of involvement of students in the quality assurance of higher education in the European Higher Education Area. Students are involved within the processes of their own institutions, as part of the quality assurance of institutions and programmes by outside bodies, and in the review of the quality assurance of those bodies themselves. Participation takes many forms, both formal and informal.
European quality assurance provides opportunities for the exchange of information and ideas on all areas of the quality assurance of higher education. The rich diversity of student involvement with quality assurance provides us with an abundant resource from which we can research and share good practice and so help all involved to learn and to develop.
Present context in student involvement
Due to marginalization of political interferences the real needs of the students are not being heard in Sri Lanka. Union activities are not towards the development of the university or the respective welfare activity rather those activities are aimed at achieving objectives of one specific group of individuals. This trend needs to be stopped. Student leaders and followers need to take the proactive role in participating the development process of their universities and the community at large. Life of a student is important throughout the value addition process in higher education.
Value of students in quality assurance in higher education
Students are at the centre of all that we do in higher education. We need to involve students in most areas of our work in higher education as they are the best stakeholders to rate the outcome of the higher education and education. UK quality assurance highly engaging students in quality assurance process. Students are involved in review teams, on the Quality Assuarance and Acreditation Board and provide them with advice through Student Advisory Committees.
What is student engagement
Student engagement is about empowering students to shape their own educational experience and creating excellent teaching and learning.
The following organisations support student engagement across the UK:
The Student Engagement Partnership (TSEP) champions and develops student engagement in the higher education sector in England. It is supported by the National Union of Students (NUS) whos Vice President for Higher Education is a Quality Assuarance and Accreditation Board member. SPARQS (student partnerships in quality Scotland) is an agency which puts students at the heart of decisions being made about the quality and governance of the learning experience. They support students to shape the nature of their learning and contribute to the overall success of learning provision, regardless of wherever and however they learn.
Wise Wales is a collaboration of organisations working to create a culture of meaningful partnership between educators, students unions and students across Wales. They help to share best practice, and above all put the collective student voice at the heart of what they do.
How can students get involved in quality assurance
Each university or college of higher education is responsible for ensuring the quality and standards of its courses and those students are achieving appropriate standards for the level they are studying at, as set out in the UK Quality Code for Higher Education.
They are responsible for checking that universities and colleges are maintaining the standards required and continuously improving on them  this is what we mean by quality assurance. The reports we produce inform students and the wider public whether a provider meets the expectations of the UK higher education sector.
Opportunities for students to take part in the quality assurance of higher education include:
 Being a representative for the programme to be developed
 Getting involved with the students union at the institution  there is often an Education Officer amongst the elected officers in the UK higher education system
 Look out for opportunities at Quality Assuarance to become a student reviewer or student member of the Committee
 Being a Lead Student Representative and contributing to a student submission, the meeting with the review team and the response to review outcomes.
Students could talk to students union or request for more information about how to get involved in quality assuarance process.
Role of students
The role of the students consists in being the largest stakeholder in higher education, investing time and money in education.
As such they have a special interest in factors that are relevant in making education a good investment. Students should be seen as partners in the academic community, because they often have a balanced view of the aim of the academic institution; on the cultural, political and historical aspects of the academic community; on the institutions role in society and on the future of the academic tradition.
This insight combined with factors such as the influence of their age, their peer group, and the time they live in, means that students may bring a valuable perspective into the panels work if the students involvement could be recognized in the review process in the higher education sector especially.
However, Sri Lanka will need time to adapt to such practices.
Wider participation and equitable access
Wider participation in higher education is important including disable category where we feel that undergraduate degree programmes in special needs education are lacking.
Improving disable friendly atmosphere in universities is needed. Student unions and leaders need to ensure facilitating rest of the students including the disable category in higher education and recommend further developments rather than damaging the public property and taking the revenge from the society at large. The famous quote Quit or Learn is more appropriate in present context.

Ranil Wijayapala: In Defence of the Truth
A tribute to senior Sunday Observer journalist Ranil Wijayapala who passed away one year ago.
Every time I go to the Sunday Observer, I cannot help looking at the corner where Ranil Wijayapala used to pound away at his keyboard, editing a copy or writing one of his trademark defence stories. I can almost hear him say Good Morning, Aiya with a radiant smile on his face. Yes, it is hard to imagine that he left us exactly one year ago.
I had the rare fortune of working with Ranil in both the Sunday Observer and the Daily News, where both of us began our respective journalistic careers. Now that I am back again in the Daily News, I can still remember the day in February 1997 when he first walked into the editorial room. The one thing I wont forget is the smile on his face as someone made the introductions.
Ranil was a fast learner. He had a yearning for learning new things in a profession where one never ceases to learn. If he made a mistake in reporting or in a copy, he made sure never to repeat it. From novice reporter to Defence Correspondent to News Editor, he literally made his mark in journalism during a life cruelly cut short. Above all, he feared no challenge in journalism  and in life itself. It was this fearlessness that enabled him to battle the greatest challenge in life. He may have lost this battle, but by living on in others hearts, he has surpassed the impermanence of life. He had a good heart and a zest for life, which is why everyone here in Lake House just cannot believe he is gone forever from our midst. He will be remembered as a fine human being first and as a brilliant journalist second.
During a journalistic career spanning over two decades, he covered many beats including Parliament, politics, crime, education and health. But his specialty was defence.
Thrust into journalism at the height of the conflict, he earned a name as a brilliant defence correspondent for both the Daily News and the Sunday Observer. His weekly defence column with up-to-the-minute analysis in the Daily News was eagerly awaited not only by the general readership but also by the defence establishment and foreign observers.
He was no armchair analyst  he walked the talk, reporting from all the major battles of the Eelam War until the final battle at Nandikadal. Indeed, Ranil could have obtained defence news over the telephone as most others did, but that cozy life was not for him. He wanted to be in the thick of the action, reporting from the battlefield as bullets and mortars whizzed past. He was also a versatile feature writer on many topics of current interest.
He joined the Sunday Observer in 2009. While working as a senior reporter of the Sunday Observer, he was appointed News Editor and held that position until his untimely demise. He had a remarkable nose for news and guided colleagues and reporters to produce exclusive stories.
Ranil was a man of peace, so when he expressed a desire to cover the war for the Daily News, I was a bit surprised. But I realised that underneath that serene outlook was a man who had nerves of steel. For the next 12 years or so, Ranil would cover the conflict extensively. Having seen the horrors of war first hand, Ranil did not rejoice in it or glorify it.
He has told me on more than one occasion that he wanted the war to end soon and peace to return. Luckily, this was achieved in his lifetime and despite his perceived penchant for war reporting, he was happy that it was over.
Ranil lived his life to the fullest with his wife Sriyani and two sons Uvindu and Dinidu by his side. Ranil personified courage, commitment, bravery and a search for truth as a journalist and as a human being. His was a short but eventful, even adventurous life that had no place for regrets and no place for sadness.
A Bana Sermon will be held at his Kaduwela residence today in his memory, followed by a Sanghika Dana tomorrow.

Seven bowlers to take 5-wicket-hauls in all three formats
Indian won the toss and posted a mammoth of 649 for 9 (declared) in their first innings. In reply to that, the Windies were bundled out for a meager 181 in their first innings which forced the Indian team to enforce the follow-on. The second innings story was no different for the Windies as they were deflated for just 196 runs in their second innings which handed India their biggest victory against them - an innings and 272 runs.
There were plenty of highlights for India from the game, be it the debutant Prithvi Shaw, the skipper Virat Kohli, the home boys Pujara and Ravindra Jadeja, Ravi Ashwin, Pant, and last but not the least Kuldeep Yadav who registered his first five-wicket haul in Test cricket.
With the five-wicket haul, Kuldeep became a part of many records. He also became the first and the only bowler in the world to take five-wicket hauls in all three formats of the game in a calendar year. Apart from that, he also became one of the very few bowlers to have taken five-wicket hauls in all the three formats of the game.
Thus, in this feature, we will have a look at all the seven players, including Kuldeep, to have achieved the feat of registering a five-wicket haul in all the three formats of the game.
#7 KULDEEP YADAV (Tests: 1, ODIs: 1, and T20Is: 1)
Kuldeep Yadav had a fair run against the Windies in the first innings of the first Test. He produced a fantastic spell to run through the West Indian batting line-up in the second innings by registering his best figures in Test cricket.
In the process, he also became the only first bowler in the world to have taken five-wicket hauls in the all the three formats in a single calendar year. Besides, he also became only the seventh bowler to have achieved the feat of five-wicket hauls in all the three formats of the game.
#6 IMRAN TAHIR (Tests: 2, ODIs: 3, and T20Is: 1)
Another spinner to have a place on the list is a leg-spinner from South Africa - Imran Tahir. With two five-wicket hauls in Tests, three in ODIs, and one five-wicket haul in T20Is, Tahir is one of the few members to have his name on the list.
Interestingly, Tahir is the only South African to have a place on the list. It is noteworthy to mention that Imran Tahir is the oldest member of this club. His recent five-wicket haul came against Zimbabwe where he took six wickets which also included a hat-trick.
#5 UMAR GUL (Tests: 4, ODIs: 2, and T20Is: 2)
The only Pakistani bowler to have a place on the list is a fast bowler from Peshawar - Umar Gul. Known for his fierce bowling skills, Gul accounted for as many as eight five-wicket hauls in international cricket - four in Tests, two in ODIs, and two in T20Is.
With two five-wicket hauls in T20Is, Gull calls for the most number of five-wicket hauls in T20Is tied with Ajantha Mendis. Gul has scalped 85 wickets in T20Is which also makes him the only third-highest wicket-taker in the history of T20I cricket.
#4 BHUVNESHWAR KUMAR (Tests: 5, ODIs: 1, and T20Is: 1)
The first ever Indian bowler to have made this list is Bhuvneshwar Kumar. The Indian death overs specialist has recorded four five-wicket hauls in Tests, one in ODIs, and one in T20Is. Kumar has now become one of the mainstays in the Indian team across all the formats.
He was the latest member of the club before Kuldeep Yadav. Bhuvi registered his name in the list after an excellent five-wicket haul against South Africa in the T20I series scheduled in February 2018.
With that, he also became the second Indian after Yuzvendra Chahal to have taken a five-wicket haul in T20I cricket.
Kuldeep was the newest and the third Indian member to have his name on the list of five-wicket hauls in T20Is.
#3 AJANTHA MENDIS (Tests: 4, ODIs: 3, and T20Is: 2)
Ajantha Mendis, a mystery spinner from Sri Lanka, also finds a place on the list. Mendis has taken a total of nine five-wicket hauls in the history of international cricket. He has taken the five wicket-hauls in the ratio of 4:3:2 in Tests, ODIs, and T20Is, respectively.
In addition to that, he also is the first and only Sri Lankan spinner to have achieved the feat. No other Sri Lankan spinner acquires a place on the list.
He also remains the only spinner to have as many as two five-wicket hauls in T20Is.
He was the first Sri Lankan to have minted his name on this very list of five-wicket hauls in all the three formats.
#2 LASITH MALINGA (Tests: 3, ODIs: 7, and T20Is: 1)
Another Sri Lankan to feature on the list is a legendary fast bowler - Lasith Malinga. He accounts for a total of 11 five-wicket hauls in the history of international cricket - three in Tests, seven in ODIs, and one in T20Is.
On 1st October 2012, Malinga became the only third player to have his name on the list.
Besides that, he also became the second Sri Lankan to have written his name on the list.
#1 TIM SOUTHEE (Tests: 7, ODIs: 2, and T20Is: 1)
Tim Southee, a fast bowling specialist from New Zealand, became the first ever bowler to have his name on this list. Southee has registered ten five-wicket hauls across all the three formats with a haul of seven in Tests, two in ODIs, and one in T20Is.
He also remains the only New Zealander to have his name on the list. With as many as seven five wicket-hauls in Tests and 220 Test wickets to his name, Southee has taken the fourth most number of wicket in Test cricket among all the New Zealand bowlers.

Asian Rugby Sevens Series 3rd leg Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka men's team should make use of home advantage
Sri Lankan Mens Tuskers should make use of home advantage in the third and final round of the Asian Rugby Sevens Series that gets underway at the Racecourse International Stadium, Reid Avenue today.
A miserable run to a disastrous sixth place out of eight teams in the second leg in South Korea, has given the side a lack of self confidence going into the third leg in Colombo.
Sri Lanka has come a long way since 2016 being placed second to a hopeless fifth place so far out of the concluded two legs in Hong Kong and South Korea this year.
The players are going to have no excuses in terms of being able to come out and be comfortable, where they are playing as a bunch of professional rugby players. In reality that comes with added experience, expectation as well and a bit of pressure the players put on themselves; since they are playing in front of their home crowd.
There is plenty on the line for a Sri Lanka sevens rugby outfit that has exuded a relaxed and focused vibe during training for the past 10 days at the Race course.
With the winner of the three-round Asian Sevens series booking a spot in the main draw at next years Hong Kong Sevens tournament, whether at least the mens Tuskers will give off their very best to better the rankings will be left to be seen in their final hurdle in Colombo.
Furthermore, the top two teams overall secure their place in the HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series qualifier next year and a fast start to the series this weekend is a key factor.
Its always a bonus that doing well will get you to these kinds of tournaments and playing against the top teams in Asia.
What was really pleasing about is that last season Sri Lanka sort of had a bit of a look at their game, and although they hadnt done much wrong they still finished overall fourth in Asia, Sri Lanka had to get a better team on the day to play the match with confidence
High Performance Director Inthi Marikar, who was a vastly experienced coach with lots of stints and knowledge in New Zealand, came in 2016 and put things right where Sri Lanka managed to learn some lessons and put them in to play with head coach Matt Turner finishing overall second in Asia just behind number one Hong Kong.
It was a lot about the training and hard work Marikar did with the Sri Lankan national sevens squad purely under him to condition the players mentally and physically to be able to handle pressure. Sometimes the players totally get it a bit wrong, but its about how you respond and Marikar was definitely the man to take our rugby forward internationally. But unfortunately he resigned from the post just before the concluded Asian Games in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Since then things look very much jaded for the countrys national men's seven a side rugby which has fallen to the lowest sixth place out of eight teams in South Korea last month just above Chinese Taipei and Malaysia, therefore going backward almost 10 years to 2009.
Going back to the main tournaments overall standings thus far, a win or a top-two finish in Sri Lanka puts Japan in the box seat to take out the overall series this weekend, but playing in Sri Lanka will be tough competition, therefore we have to wait and see whether their power pack display carried throughout the first and second legs will be enough for them to seal victory.
SRI LANKA 12 MAN SQUAD:
Srinath Sooriyabandara (Captain)-(Kandy SC), Danush Dayan (Vice-Captain)-(Kandy SC), Danushka Ranjan (Kandy SC), Gayan Weeraratne (Kandy SC), Naveen Henakankanamage (CH & FC), Sudam Sooriyarachchi (CH & FC), Kevin Dixon (CR & FC), Reeza Raffaideen (CR & FC), Kavindu Perera (CR & FC), Omalka Gunarathane  (CR & FC), Dinuk Amerasinghe (Havelock SC), Adeesha Weeratunge ( Navy SC)

Tamil reps erred by taking violent stance in 1977 - Sampanthan
Sri Lanka could have averted an armed struggle had the Tamil political representatives taken a lesson from late Mahatma Gandhi and launched a Satyagraha campaign on the basis of truth, civil disobedience and Ahimsa in 1977, Opposition Leader R.Sampanthan said.
Joining in the adjournment debate to commemorate Gandhis 150th Birth Anniversary in Parliament yesterday, the Opposition Leader observed that it was a great mistake that they did not engage in such a non-violent course of action in 1977 against the Sri Lankan Government.
He pointed out that the Tamil political representation was strong in Parliament at that time as a large number of their members had been elected to Parliament from the North and the East of the country.
I have often thought that in 1977, when there was a UNP Government elected under President J. R. Jayewardene, we could have averted an armed struggle in this country, if we had resorted to Satyagraha, civil disobedience and Ahimsa on the lines of what Gandhi taught us. Had we done that we could have won our own self-rule in our areas without violence. It is my hope that we will never have violence in this country again, said the Opposition Leader.
He also urged the Tamil people to abide by the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi to win their rights without resorting to violence, if the Government fails to deliver on its commitments to find an adequate solution to the national question.
We must all be grateful to this great son of India for the concept of non-violence, Ahimsa, Satyagraha, truth and civil disobedience which he introduced as an instrument to fight injustice, inequality and subservience. He unified India. India is a large country. He preserved the identity of all people in India. Every Indian, whether he was a Bengali, Panjabi, Thelingu, Malayali or Tamil, first called himself an Indian. He made India one country in which Indian people lived with self-respect. He brought India together, not merely by recognising linguistic identity and carving out states on the basis of linguistic identity, but also by ensuring that this linguistic identity did not surpass the Indian identity, he added.

Allegedly releasing lorry with sand sans permit:
Thebuwana OIC on the mat
The Officer-in-Charge of Thebuwana Police in Kalutara is on the mat for allegedly releasing a lorry loaded with sand travelling without a valid permit.
A special police team is conducting investigations into the matter on the orders of Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara. ASP Kingsley Gunasekara of the Special Investigations Unit of the Police Head Quarters is conducting investigations. Thebuwana Police OIC had been summoned to the Police Head Quarters to record his statement. A Sergeant had seized the lorry and arrested the driver but the OIC had later released the driver without producing him before the Mathugama Magistrate. Sergeant Sanath Gunawardena had confronted the OIC and created a scene on October 3 at Thebuwana. A large crowd had also gathered in support of the Sergeant.
Kalutara Police arrested the Sergeant and produced him before Mathugama Magistrate Kosala Senadira and he was remanded for a few days.
The public also held a picketing in favour of the Sergeant.
The Mathugama Magistrate later released the Sergeant on Monday ordering a personal bail of Rs. 50,000 with two sureties. The Special Investigations Unit is to hand over the investigations report to the Inspector General of Police.

Three oldest players to score a century in ODIs
One-day cricket has always been known as a youngsters' game. It takes a toll on the player as it demands a lot of physical activity. To score a century in one-day cricket, a player should not only be well-equipped to play a wide range of shots and get boundaries but also have the awareness to rotate strike and get some quick singles and doubles.
While a century is an achievement any cricketer craves for, some cricketers have been more fortunate to get a century when they are relatively older. In this article, we look at the three oldest cricketers ever to score a century in ODIs.
#3 ED JOYCE (39 years 111 days)
Ed Joyce is one of the most popular cricketers to have ever played for Ireland. He is also one of the very few cricketers to have played for two countries ( Ireland and England ). At the beginning of 2018, Ed Joyce slammed a century against UAE in the tri-series (also featuring Scotland) at Dubai.
After being put to bat first by Ireland, UAE could only put up a paltry score of 222-9 in 50 overs. Rameez Shahzad was the top scorer for UAE with 75 off 111. Niall O'Brien was really good behind the stumps and took five catches.
In return, Ireland lost wickets in quick succession and were left reeling at 91-5. Ed Joyce then went on to add 131-run partnership with Gary Wilson for the sixth wicket to take Ireland home. He played a very calculated innings and finished with 116 off 149 balls, with 13 fours and a six.
#2 SANATH JAYASURIYA (39 years 212 days)
Sanath Jayasuriya is one of the most dangerous batsmen of all-time. His exploits at the top gave the Sri Lankan batting line up, much-needed confidence and allowed the other batsman to express themselves.
He scored 13430 runs in 433 matches, at an average of 32.36, with 28 hundreds and 68 fifties. He became the then oldest player to record a century, when he did it against his favorite, India in 2009.
In the first match of the 5-ODI series at home, Jayasuriya played a scintillating knock, scoring 107 off 114 balls. His innings had 10 fours and a six, played at a very good strike-rate of 93.86. No one apart from him could get it going and the hosts only scored 246-7 in 50 overs. India chased it down very easily but Jayasuriya's innings gained a lot of attention.
#1 KHURRAM KHAN (43 years 162 days)
A very surprising name here at No.1 on the list. It is Khurram Khan of UAE who is the oldest player to score a century in ODIs. He achieved this feat when he scored a century against Afghanistan in a 4-match ODI series.
After beating Afghanistan in the first ODI very convincingly, the focus shifted to the second ODI in Dubai. The hosts won the toss and chose to bowl first. Afghanistan posted a chaseable total of 280-8, on the back of Nawroz Mangal's 129 off 123.
In return, the hosts lost two early wickets and were reduced to 32-2. Khurram Khan, who came in at No.4, steered the innings along with Mohammad Shahzad and the duo added 160 runs for the third wicket, before the latter got dismissed.
Khurram Khan then went on to smash a century, scoring 137 off 138 balls, accompanied by 17 fours and a six. This was Khurram's only century in ODIs and he also became the first UAE player to score a century.  sportsk

Turkey, U.S. press Saudis on missing journalist
TURKEY: Turkey and the United States on Thursday ratcheted up the pressure on Saudi Arabia to explain how a journalist vanished after entering its Istanbul consulate last week, with US lawmakers warning that military ties were at risk.
President Donald Trump became more forceful in his call for answers from Saudi Arabia but he also rebuffed calls from the US Congress to show more resolve, saying he would not jeopardise arms sales to the close ally.
Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national whose articles have criticised Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has not been seen since October 2 when he went to the consulate in Istanbul to obtain official documents for his upcoming marriage.
Turkish officials have said he was killed -- reportedly by a 15-man "assassination team" that arrived on two planes -- but Riyadh insists that he left the consulate safely.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in his most extensive remarks on Khashoggi, challenged Saudi Arabia to provide CCTV images to back up its account.
"Is it possible there were no camera systems in a consulate, in an embassy" he asked. "If a bird flew, or a fly or a mosquito appeared, the systems would capture this; they (Saudi Arabia) have the most cutting-edge systems," he was quoted as telling Turkish reporters.
The consulate said CCTV cameras were not working that day and dismissed the murder claims as "baseless". The Washington Post reported however that the Turkish government has told US officials it has audio and video recordings which show how Khashoggi was "interrogated, tortured and then murdered" inside the consulate before his body was dismembered. - AFP

Two yesteryear batsmen who would have wreaked havoc in todays times
The cricket aficionados have watched the might of West Indies in the 1970s and 80s; witnessed the Australians dominate the world cricket in the 1990s before India took the mantle in the early 2000s. Each era had its own star bowlers and batsmen. But, only a few of them were the best of all time. According to the popular opinion, the two batsmen who played in the 1970s and 80s were superior to most of the players we see today.
Let us discuss both of them.
#2. VIVIAN RICHARDS
Vivian Richards was macho and suave, both in looks and batting. He made his debut against India in 1974 and announced his arrival with aplomb by scoring 192 not out. His batting style was extravagant and aggressive. Richards was probably the first batsman to look into the eyes of fast bowlers and challenge them to have a go at him. Like Sunil Gavaskar, he never wore a helmet and yet played the pull and hook shots to perfection.
Richards could dispatch a ball from outside the off-stump to square leg for a six and then play an elegant square cut of the same ball. The interviews of most of the fast bowlers like Lillee, Thomson, Imran, Akram, and others show their admiration for him.
He was brutal but never lost the grip of his technique. His duel with Lillee is folklore in the annals of cricket history. All throughout his career, he batted against Thomson, Lillee, Imran, Richard Hadlee, Kapil Dev, Bishan Bedi, and others who were the best in the business. If he played against Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammad Amir, James Anderson, Kuldeep Yadav, and other such bowlers, he would have scored an obscene amount of runs.
Richards played when the West Indies had batsmen like Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Clive Lloyd, and others. He did not get sufficient time in test cricket and ODIs to display his talent and conviction. One can be sure he would have added a few thousand runs to his batting statistics, had he batted long enough.
#1. SUNIL GAVASKAR
The Little Master was a work of art. People marvelled at his batting similar to the way they looked at the Mona Lisa. The way he stood and took his stance was a sight to behold.
He played every stroke in the books with such grace and manner it felt that someone had translated the words into action on the field. He played the exquisite straight drives, perfect square cuts, and elegant late-cuts. A few YouTube videos show him playing the hook and pull shots of the bowling of Malcolm Marshall. Kapil Dev once told in an interview Gavaskar bore the entire burden of Indian batting and hence gave up playing these risky shots.
No bowler could dominate him. He faced Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding, Imran Khan, Abdul Qadir, and others with ease and determination. He would have scored more runs if he had to face the bowlers of modern times such as Stuart Broad, Shaun Tait, Shane Warne, Muralitharan, and others who despite being great were no match for the yesteryear bowlers in terms of skills, variations, and consistency.
In those days, bowlers could ball as many bouncers as they liked. The batsmen had less protection as compared to what they have nowadays. Gavaskar played all his matches against Australia, England, Pakistan, West Indies, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand. Except for Sri Lanka, all other teams were established and had an array of strong bowlers. Had he played against Zimbabwe or Bangladesh, he would have scored profusely.
The wickets were uncovered in those times, and hence it was very difficult to bat in the initial 10-15 overs of the day. He was gifted with supreme concentration, which helped him negotiate the fast bowlers with no struggle. Nowadays wickets are covered, and hence the effect of dew and moisture is not considerable. Had he played now, he would have scored a few thousand more runs.  sportsk

US supports heritage preservation project
US Embassys Charg daffaires Robert Hilton inaugurated a two-year project to preserve pre-historic artefacts in the collection of the University of Jaffna.
The funding is provided by the U.S. Department of State under the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP). It totals over Rs. 23 million.
The project will rescue artefacts such as clay pots, brass and copper items, temple statues, coins, coral stones, and ceramic objects that are on the verge of irreversible decay.
Most of the collection was excavated in the Northern Province.
The project will involve both undergraduate and postgraduate archaeology students of the University of Jaffna. Professor P. Pushparatnam, a senior professor and the Project Director, submitted the proposal to the U.S. Embassy and AFCP.
University of Jaffna Vice-Chancellor Professor R. Vigneswaran will assist the project.A nations cultural heritage is one of its most precious resources, said Charg Hilton.
Cultural heritage reminds us of the historical experiences of humanity.
I am delighted that the U.S. Embassy is supporting the preservation of these important artefacts, which tell the story of the Sri Lankan people. When preservation is complete, the objects will be on display at the University of Jaffnas museum.
Since 2001, AFCP has funded 13 projects in Sri Lanka, including the conservation of a Buddhist temple, the restoration of the Batticaloa Dutch Fort, the preservation of Buddhist, Hindu, and other collections in the Anuradhapura Archaeological Museum, and the preservation of the intangible heritage of ritual music and dance forms of the Adivasi, Tamil, and Buddhist communities.
AFCP supports the preservation of cultural sites, cultural objects, and forms of traditional cultural expression in more than 100 countries.
