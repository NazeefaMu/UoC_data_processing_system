Farmers yet to receive fertiliser subsidies
Fertiliser subsidies for farmers were not deposited in their bank accounts as promised by the government. If the government breach their promise further, farmers will launch another struggle after five days, All Island Farmers Alliance and Provincial Councillor Chairman Namal Karunarathna said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Dambulla Siyapatha Hotel recently.
Karunarathna said the government is trying to suppress farmers' rights. He said the farmers have to struggle to gain their rights. "We made several protests to win our rights in the past and succeeded in gaining some of them. Another struggle will be launched to gain the fertiliser subsidies," he said.
He said sufficient rice and paddy stocks are available until next February. "The Auditor Generals report has proved it. But the stocks are remaining in private sector. The rice market has limited only to a few large -scale paddy millers.
The entire monopoly of rice market was grabbed by the private sector.

Organised group on mudslinging campaign
An organised group of members numbering about 40 are conducting mudslinging campaigns using separate websites against government parliamentarians, said Higher Education and Highways Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella.
They are led by a Joint Opposition MP, he said. The minister said: We will conduct a formal investigation into this and take legal action against this group.
This is a well-organized attempt to tarnish the unity between the two major parties as well as to sabotage the process of providing long-term solutions for unresolved problems.
The Minister stated these views attending an event held in Rajawatta, Peradeniya on Sunday.
Even during the recent floods and landslides, mudslinging campaigns were conducted against government parliamentarians. A majority of the people are against such acts, he added.
Provincial MPs and other invitees attended the event.

## Title: Welcome increase in Lankas tea crop for March

Welcome increase in Lankas tea crop for March
Following the decline in tea production, tea export earnings during the calendar year 2016 amounted to US$ 1.269 billion representing 12.3% of total export earnings compared with US$ 1.340 billion amounting to 12.7% of export earnings in 2015, according to the Ceylon Tea Brokers Annual Report 2016/17.
This substantial drop was partly due to adverse weather conditions and, importantly, the restriction placed on the availability of weedicide and consequent curtailment of necessary agricultural practices and inputs. These contributory factors led to extremely poor performance. All three elevations recorded lower figures.
Sri Lanka tea production for the year under review witnessed a substantial decline, recording the lowest production in last seven years.
Tea production for the year ending March 31, 2017, amounted to 288.7 million kilos recording a significant decline of 31.1 million kilos (-9.7%) compared to the previous year.
High Grown and Mid Grown production has dropped by 10.7 million kilos (-14.5%) and 5.5 million kilos ( 11.1%) respectively whilst the Low Grown production declined by 15.0 Million kilos (-7.6%).
Total quantity of tea exported for the financial year ending March 31, 2017, including re-exports with imported tea amounting to 282.73 million kilos showing a considerable decline of 25.48 million kilos (-8.27%) compared to the same period last year.
Drop in production accounted for the lower export volume for the period 2016/17.
However, with the increase in the FOB price per kilo from Rs. 592.89 to Rs. 680.42, total export value for the period showed a marginal gain of Rs. 9.64 billion (+5.27%) as against the same period last year.
Export earnings from tea, the second largest export commodity in Sri Lanka, which accounts for about 12 % of total export earnings, marginally declined to US$ 1.30 billion as against US$ 1.32 billion in 2015/2016 recording the lowest value for the last seven years.
Despite this, the single most redeeming feature on the performance of Sri Lankas tea industry last year has been the increase in the auction averages compared to 2015 both when expressed in Sri Lanka Rupee and the US dollar equivalent.
Following the limited availability of tea, together with improved demand from some of our main markets, prices have moved up further during the first four months of 2017.
At the time of compiling of this Report, to date auction averages for the current year are at all-time highs both in terms of Rupees as well as the USD equivalents.
"Although there was a welcome increase in Sri Lankas national crop for March it is too early to predict whether this pattern will be maintained for the rest of the year and we can only hope that the total tea crop for 2017 will at least record a figure over the psychological barrier of 300 million kilos," says Ceylon Tea Brokers PLC, making a comment to their Annual Report 2016/17.
This encouraging sign however should be tempered with a word of caution in that if the availability of tea out of Sri Lanka continues to be limited, at some point, we may lose our market share in the more important importing countries due to a lack of regular and adequate supply.
In spite of the higher average FOB price per kilo reflective of the higher auction prices, the total volume of exports have declined following the drop in production. Increase in value has compensated for the drop in volume in respect of Rupee earnings from tea, which amounted to Rs. 184.78 billion in 2016, marginally more than the Rs.182.05 billion in 2015.
The disappointing factor however is that the total value of exports in terms of US dollars has declined to US$1.27 billion, which is the lowest since US$ 1.15 billion in 2009.

Belle Wirakoon  a tribute by Tamara Hewage
We sadly miss Belle Wirakoon who dominated table tennis in the 1970s. I just started playing table tennis during that time when I met this humble lady who was having strength and fighting spirit.
She had a very good character and was able to face victory as well as defeat equally. At that time I was so glad not to meet her in the draw as I was not good enough to play against choppers.
Belle was the best defensive womens player at that time. Preeth Swaris was the only player who could dominate against her easily. I have lost to Belle almost all the occasions I met her in the singles event.
Ive learnt a lot from her especially how to play against a defensive player. I think many women players gained a lot of experience through her.
We all sadly miss her and may her soul rest in peace.

Bowlers are getting eaten alive in ODIs
One of the critical duties of cricket administrators is to ensure the laws of the game maintain a reasonable balance between bat and ball, like a pair of scales see-sawing in the process of finding an even balance; a constant jiggling so neither the bat nor the ball is favoured too much.
On the early evidence of the 2017 Champions Trophy, theres currently a bar of gold on the scale representing the bat and a feather on the other side, denoting the plight of the bowler.
Three hundred runs for a 50-over innings is now the norm, and quite often it isnt enough to gain victory. And all this in an England summer blighted by rain squalls that you would normally expect to juice up the pitches.
The former world record-holding wicket-taker Fred Trueman used to bemoan the fact that the last bluddy bowler to be knighted was Sir Francis Drake. The way things are heading, the modern bowler will only kneel before royalty to plead for mercy.
Despite the inclement weather, the ball has neither swung nor moved much off the seam. That normally lethal finisher Lasith Malinga of Sri Lanka has been reduced to pitching deliveries well wide of off stump in the hope that batsmen will either toe-end the shot to the man on the cover boundary or thick-edge it to the fielder patrolling third man.
Once a bowler is directing deliveries well wide of the stumps, all the classic ambushes are removed from the contest and the batsman has the upper hand. Once a bowler is purely trying to contain, often in the hope that the shot will only bring a four instead of disappearing deep into the crowd, the spectacle is basically reduced to a batting exhibition.
To emphasise the normalisation of the 300 total, it has twice been chased down in the first eight matches of this Champions Trophy, once against the much-vaunted Indian bowling.
India, thought to have one of the better balanced attacks in the tournament, were powerless to stop a vibrant Sri Lankan batting line-up imbued with the death-or-glory spirit of the modern batsman. Theres no doubting the power, the nerveless approach and the innovative spirit of the modern batsman. They appear to be completely oblivious to the embarrassment a batsman used to experience when he holed out in the deep, playing what was deemed a reckless shot. Its now considered an abrogation of duty if a batsman doesnt try to send at least one delivery soaring into the stands each over.
If a fan heads to an ODI hoping to see the odd classic dismissal where the batsman is lured to his downfall after a series of searching deliveries, he had better be seated for the opening over.
In this century alone, the run rate in ODI matches has improved by nearly one per over. In this decade the number of sixes per innings has increased by one and a half times. The average per wicket is three runs better now than in 1999. This is not a calamity of global-warming proportions, but if batting stats keep climbing at this alarming rate, a tipping point must surely be reached. There will come a time when an ODI becomes a batting exhibition rather than a contest.
The more the first-innings totals climb, the harder it becomes for the chasing side to stay in the contest. There are too few exciting finishes now in ODI games without the number being further reduced.
The administrators are going to have to give greater consideration to the evolution of bats. Boundary sizes will need to come under closer scrutiny, and some experimentation with the ball is required to aid bowlers in gaining some swing. Somehow the emphasis on wicket-taking rather than pure containment has to become a viable consideration.
The game cant become a batting exhibition where fans are baying for the bowlers blood. After all, Lions versus Christians eventually lost its lustre as a contest.  Cricinfo

Brilliant Ariya on top of world with Manulife Classic win
Toronto, Sunday: Thailands Ariya Jutanugarn drained a 25-foot birdie putt to win the Manulife LPGA Classic in a three-way playoff Sunday, guaranteeing her ascent to the world number one ranking.
Her dramatic win at Whistle Bear Golf Club in Cambridge, Ontario came after rival Lexi Thompson stumbled with four bogeys on the back nine which saw a four-shot lead evaporate.
On the first playoff hole, Thompson looked to have recovered her composure when she crushed a long tee shot 50 yards further than Ariya and South Koreas Chun In-Gee.
Ariya, who had underhit her tee shot into the fairway rough, hit her second onto the green.
Both Chun and Thompson then missed long birdie putts leaving Ariya with her shot at glory which she duly converted.
The result capped a rollercoaster week for the 21-year-old from Bangkok, who had wrongly been informed by the LPGA last week that she had taken the world number one ranking.
The LPGA later revealed she had not in fact taken the top spot from New Zealands Lydia Ko because of a rankings miscalculation.
Thompson meanwhile was left reflecting on her third defeat in a playoff this season after she looked to be cruising to her second title of the year.
Thompson, 22, had opened up a four-shot lead by the 11th hole.
But back-to-back bogeys on the 12th and 13th holes gave her rivals hope before Thompson recovered with a birdie on the par-four 15th.
However a three-putt on the par-three 17th set up a tense finale with Thompson one shot clear.
After making the green in regulation, the American was left with two putts to win.
But her birdie putt rolled up short, leaving her with a four-footer for victory which she then missed, setting up the playoff drama.
Ariya had entered the playoff after a three-under-par final round 69 while Chun forced her way into contention with a two-under-par 70. AFP

Call of  motherhood
Sirima Jayasekera who is living in London as a bankers wife, a concert pianist and music teacher with four children found the call of her Motherhood to reach the children of the world. Her love for children and the belief to be the cradle of hope for mankind is deep seated. The call bloomed into a flower a decade ago noticing the fate of children in the Cancer Hospitals children ward in Sri Lanka.
While the call of universal motherhood churned within her, she had to work out the mathematics of reality for the manifestation of the project to bear fruit. She combined two of her passions, Motherhood and Music. Symphony for a Child is Jayasekeras brainchild to make the funds available to create the facilities needed to up-lift children in need.
The first concert Symphony for a Child came to being at Regent Hall in central London in 1999. It made 4, 000 sterling pounds. Ever since then she has collected 4, 000 to 6, 000 pounds every year in London. She now has a ward at IDH Angoda Sri Lanka, with a playground and now she is targeting to add a Library to it. She has also extended her motherhood to children of North and East of Sri Lanka too. She considers those living there to be victims of war and as the hope for the nations peace.
This year with her presence in Sri Lanka, Symphony for a Child will be held in Colombo at the Lionel Wendt Theater. To enhance the concert Sirima has embraced Piano, Flute, Violin, Cello, Vocal Duet, choir, Kandyan Drums, Jazz Piano and Rhythm Blues. The variety will reach a wider audience.
Sirima as she is popularly known did whatever possible and is still doing whatever possible at 85 to give a better life to children in her motherland. What manifested from her generosity are the wards 2A and 2B of the IDH hospital for HIV positive children which is on its ninth year of existence.
It is also noticeable that the wards are up to European standard in hygiene, facility and service. Sirima is not stopping here Plans are made to venture further.
Symphony for a child does not stop at giving only shelter, cure and good health but also provides a solid foundation in education. Namal Yapage was recommended to Sirima by Susil Gunesekera. Hailing from the rural south, he completed his education in Kattubadde University and won a scholarship to Sydney West University in Australia. Today he has a doctorate in Civil Engineering having received four special awards for his thesis.
There are several others with good academic achievements. All are under the umbrella of her care without exception and they all feel that there is light at the end of the tunnel.
Symphony for a Childs proceeds from inception has been donated to the AIDS foundation of Sri Lanka to treat the HIV Positive children and families affected by HIV/AIDS. The foundation supports in facilitating prevention and care programs initiated by the Sri Lankan Government. They are an indispensable unit in the efficient and effective working of the project.
Sirima does not hesitate to mention the dedicated staff of the hospital who manages the wards at IDH in Angoda. Caring is a 24 hour dedicated shift and without doubt a tiring job. Consultant doctors Nishadi Ranasinghe, Ananda Wijewickrema and Myrna Cabraal along with the devoted hands of Matron Geethani Udugamakorale Sister Madusha and ward nurses deliver the sun-dial of hope. Sirima considers them to be the engine of the project and the heavenly caring hands to the children.
Opportunities can change the world to good is Sirimas belief. For her it is not a statement but a conviction. Her motherhood dream is a reality now.
This years Symphony for a Child will be held in at Lionel Wendt Theater, Colombo, on June 25 at 7 pm. The program has been put together with many great names volunteering to perform for the cause without any financial considerations.
Sulara Nanayakkara will play the Violin; Rashane Fernando is a classical guitarist; Ramya Perera will be at the piano playing modern jazz by Fazil Say; and students of Mary Anne David will perform a combination of classical and semi classical songs that will be a delight to listen to. The students of Haasinee Andree will add to the mix with a spectrum of modern music.
Drumming a beat would be the students of Ravi Bandhu Vidhyapathy. Tilanka Jayamanne a Flautist will perform a solo.

Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratories will be established island wide: Health Minister
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne in conversation with the current President of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) Prof. Carlo Fonseka.
We are now in the process of equipping and establishing Cardiac Catheterisation Laboratories in every Province to minimize patients expenses and to reduce the waiting period for surgeries, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
He said this while addressing the Sri Lanka Heart Associations 17th Annual Academic Sessions held in Colombo recently.
According to Minister Senaratne, the HealthMinistry has allocated a fairly large percentage from the Health Ministry budget worth Rs.85 billion to provide free services for interventional, surgical and medical management for cardiac patients in Sri Lanka.
Minister Senaratne pointed out thatGovernments multifaceted efforts to fight non-communicable diseases or life style diseases, such as setting up healthy life style centers island wide, introducing the traffic light indication to control sugar, salt and trans-fats, restricting tobacco/ alcohol marketing etc. will help to mitigate this trend.
Today, Cardiology Services are widely available in all major hospitals in the country as a result of the appointment of consultant cardiologists not only to all tertiary care units, but also to almost all provincial and district General Hospitals as well, he said.
We are also now in the process of revising the procurement procedures to ensure a continuous supply of stents, balloons, catheters etc. to ensure smooth running of the newly setup chain of Cath labs.
It is also my wish to upgrade the national cardiology unit at NHSL to a state of the art regional center of excellence, so that we can use the expert knowledge of our well qualified cardiologists in interventions and surgeries for the benefit of our people, the Minister said.

CB wont defend exchange rate with reserves - Governor
The Central Bank would not use reserves to defend the exchange rate in the future, said Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
We want to make sure that we do it gradually and to ensure that the economy remains competitive and the exchange rate contributes to it, he said at the 22nd convocation of the Institute of Bankers of Sri Lanka (IBSL) held at the BMICH, last week.
Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) intends to manage the exchange rate flexibility and the framework is over time - gradually - to get to the point where the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is 100.
The Central Bank will make sure there is no rapid fluctuation or volatility in the exchange rate. Moreover, it will be very watchful to see that there is no speculation and we will move decisively to deal with anybody who embarks on speculative activities.
Dr. Coomaraswamy further noted that it is not profitable to have an export performance improvement without a competitive exchange rate.
In addition, CBSL is introducing a flexible inflation targeting regime for the monetary policy which would enable the CBSL to have a much more forward looking and proactive monetary policy.
Moreover, this would enable the Bank to move quickly and early in terms of interest rate movements.
We are able to smooth the interest rate cycle and not to have the sharp volatilities and fluctuations as seen in the past. Commenting on local banking sector, Dr, Coomaraswamy noted that strong capital liquidity requirement and macro-prudential regulations should provide enough cushions for the banking sector to face any turbulence in the coming years.
The Governor further noted that plans were also put in place to support the growth framework of the economy in the area of investment policy and promotion, trade policy and trade facilitation.

Walk gone to the dogs
The dog walkers are a nuisance to people who go for a walk early morning down Isipathana Mawatha. There are about eight to ten dogs taken for a walk to relieve themselves. Its absolutely nauseating to see dog excrement early morning on the pavement. Couple of them take spades and throw the stuff into the nearby drain or the nearby lane.
Ironically these are all English educated people who might think they are the Crme de la socit. There are some who are courteous but some are even arrogant and flaunt the dogs job right in front of your eyes. For a person who goes for a morning walk, very likely has just gulped down a glass of water and mostly on an empty stomach this sight is nauseating. Rainy days make it worse as the excrement is soggy and smelly and attract flies.
Earlier the sand or grass patches on the street were dog toilets, now with the paved roads, it has become worse. If this uncivilized behaviour of the so called educated society continues, what do we expect from the more unsophisticated general public These are ladies who would scorn at a fallen bread crumb on a table at home or a hotel but would not mind standing by the roadside while their pets relieve themselves. The same society would wrinkle their noses when a manual labourer smells of sweat. How hypocritical can the society be Mind you there are foreigners belonging to the diplomatic corps, I have observed several times at the Independence grounds taking dogs for similar walks. Would they do that in their own countries, never! But they think the white skin is a passport for arrogant behaviour in South Asia.
This routine happens in the evening and night as well but there are less people at that time of the day. I am sure this happens in other parts of the city. At least our own educated society should be more civic conscious and be a good example of civilized behaviour for others to emulate. Bring a spade and a bag and remember the sight is disgusting to others or better still do that in your own garden!

He said that the Port City would also have several specialsed ares including a marine university area, recreation area, residential area and also the financial district, Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) is a special financial zone that is expected to become an offshore financial centre.
Thow also said that the Port City when completed would be similar to small city in the world like Canary Wharf area in London. He said that this project is also in the main route of the proposed Silk route of China and it would be of tremendous importance.
He said the project has already attracted numerous investors from all over the world.
In 2016 the Port City project was again added in the Megapolis plan and the government which planned an International Finance Center in Colombo with its own laws decided to sign a new tripartite agreement which resulted in the project becoming the Colombo International Finance City.

Discipline first!
Muhammadh Irfan Aqeel, a 16 year old boy, has brought glory to his Alma Mater, St Marys College, Nawalapitiya, by obtaining nine As at Ordinary Level 2016 exam. A student from the school has achieved this feat after a lapse of 18 years.
Aqeel has focused on both studies and sports. In the countdown to the exam, he has done past papers and model papers without depending much on tuition.
Aqeels parents, Muhammadh Irfaan and Fathima Rizmiya and his teachers at St Marys College, Nawalapitiya, were the great forces behind him, enabling him to achieve this feat.
Daily News T&C interviewed Aqeel on behalf of other students who strive to make mother Lanka proud. The discussion turned out to be an eye-opener.
How did you feel when you got to know of this accomplishment
I was very proud as I could draw the attention of the country towards my school. Being the only student in the school to obtain nine As after 18 years is of course a personal achievement as well.
How did you engage in studies and what kind of support did you get from your parents and teachers
I mostly did past papers and model papers without depending much on tuition. I attended seminars and workshops held in school with my friends when the exam was nearing. I must thank my teachers for organizing those seminars.
At the time I was studying for Ordinary level, there was no laboratory in my school. I used to watch science experiments on the internet using my mothers smart phone.
My parents were the pillars of my success. My mother who is a housewife even ironed my cloths and paid for my class fees in time. She taught me Tamil at home.
Did you engage in sports while studying for your Ordinary Level exam
I played cricket in school and was in under-11 and 13 teams. I was also a member of the under 15 swimming squad. Engaging in sports enhanced my physical fitness.
What good qualities have you derived from your parents
Our family lived in the Sigiriya Air Force camp when I was five or six years old. My father served for 12 years there. I had many Sinhala friends there.
My father gave me a golden advice. He told me discipline comes first. I must give first priority to discipline. He encouraged me to do sports but said if I intend to excel in studies I must make sure sports do not disrupt my studies.
As Muslims we pray five times a day and Friday is a special day where we go to the Mosque. My father insisted that I should respect all religions.
Do you have brothers and sisters
I have two younger sisters. My elder sister is studying at an International school.
You study in Tamil medium but have a sound knowledge in English. How important do you think English is for children
English is the gateway to a vast knowledge hub. I am good in grammar but must improve my spoken English.
I intend to enter the medical college. In the university lectures are conducted in English as I have heard. So to continue with my studies I must know my English. When you know your English you can read many books on varied subjects and enhance your knowledge.
Also knowledge in English paves way to find good jobs here and abroad.
I think all Sri Lankan children must be taught English as a common language for communication purposes.
What activities do you engage in these days
Since I am at home these days on Ramalan vacation, I enjoy spending time with my little sisters and parents. In the meantime since I want to follow subjects in the Science stream, I attend private classes on the subjects; chemistry, physics and biology.
What is your future ambition
want to serve my country by becoming a specialist doctor. I intend to become a Gynecologist.
In my present school, Nawalapitiya St Marys College, there is only Commerce and Art streams so I will enter Gampaha Zahira College do to my Advanced level studies.

Do not doubt government's forward march: Kiriella
"The discussions held among the main parties in the good governance government to review their collective agreement for the next four years have been successfully completed. Therefore, no one should entertain any doubts about the government's forward march," Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
Minister Kiriella was addressing a meeting after laying the foundation stone for a new children's park at Rajawatta, Peradeniya on June 11.
He said the President and the Prime Minister had great confidence in each other and the government will go from strength to strength during the ensuing four years.
He said two and a half years had lapsed since the government assumed power and certain critics were claiming that the government was short-lived. "To those predicting the downfall of the government, I would say they were highly mistaken for the government would last for its full term with added strength and vigour," the minister said.
He said it was the United National Front, which provided leadership to the campaign to bring President Maithripala Sirisena to power.
Therefore, the UNP had a duty to steer the national government forward while protecting the President. He said the government has committed to fulfil the pledges held out to the people during the Presidential and the General Elections.

Matching the right skills and talent development for future market requirements Motivating students to build on their strategic leadership skills, develop confidence and interpersonal relationships, develop time management skills, EDULINK International campus launches an exciting and innovative competition titled the EDU 360 challenge.
Organized by EDULINK International Campus with the clear intention of inspiring young school leavers in honing the skills of school leavers for the corporate world, the competition will involve group activities on strategy, entertainment activities and an after party.
The students will be testing limits and pushing boundaries to complete exciting races, scavenger hunts and a host of interesting challenges within a stipulated time period , with the ultimate winner carrying away a trip to Malaysia for two nights and three days and the 2nd and 3rd prize winners being awarded a holiday package in a five star hotel and high tea at the Hotel Galadari.
Better soft skills for better jobs: Speaking of this initiative, The Director of EDULINK International Campus, Kanishka Weeramunda said, We wanted to take a deep dive into helping eliminate and minimize the soft skills gap that exists among students in terms of being prepared to face the corporate world. Students need to have strong communication and problem-solving skills, leadership and teamwork if they want to succeed in the workplace today.It has been found that whilst many young students today are well qualified, these soft skills are greatly lacking. We believe that competitions of this nature will motivate students to learn these skills and understand their importance. Having these top soft skills on a resume could translate to placement in a much higher level job, resulting in a significantly higher pay for such students.by gaining these high-level skills.
The event will be held on June 24 commencing from 9am at the Colombo Racecourse Grounds. Interested students can register by visiting www.edu360.edulink.edu.lk
EDULINK International Campus is a fully owned subsidiary of EDULINK Consultants, Dubai, UAE being currently affiliated to two high ranked UK universities namely; University of Northampton and University of Greenwich, is utilizing this innovative venture in ensuring that students complete their education with the requisite soft skills that matches their competences and will put them in a better position to gain the jobs they have qualified for.

Every child has a right to be heard
Sri Lanka has all the necessary vital statistics to be a child-friendly country: high literacy rate, high life expectancy, educated population, good infrastructure, low population growth, excellent geography and location.
World Bank has given us middle-income country status with GDP Per Capita (nominal) of $ 3870.00. The Bank has also forecasted accelerated economic growth in the next three years on the back of the proposed reform programme.
United Nations categorized us as High Human development country. In UNs latest Human Development Index, we are ranked 73. On top of all, we have literacy rate of 93%.
All these figures are well above our regional peers.
So, at first glance, Sri Lanka is an ideal place in South Asia to raise a child. However, this picture is not as close to perfection as one might believe. Certain things still escape Sri Lanka in terms of its childrens rights, particularly, child labour, education, and juvenile justice.
Look at these figures. Over 9,000 instances of violence involving children were reported to the National Child Protection Authority in 2016. Studies highlighted that 40 percent of parents surveyed in the Colombo district admitted physically abusing their child, 14 percent of adolescent girls and boys surveyed had experienced some form of sexual abuse and 31 percent of adolescent boys and 25 percent of adolescent girls surveyed had experienced emotional abuse. These are disturbing facts.
Poverty
It is a fact that the majority of our children and youth are in school or are enrolled in formal training. Yet, some do not have this opportunity and must work to help support their families. On the brighter side, we have witnessed that, during the last two decades, there has been an increase in income for most of the citizens resulting a rapid decline of children who need to work. Still the problem is not fully eradicated. A recent report indicated that out-of-schoolchildren amounts to around 2 per cent. However, lower-secondary-school-age (10-13 years) children face greater a risk of dropping out (5.1%).
This study found the reasons are most commonly linked to income, poverty, inadequacies in the supply of schools and teachers, deficiencies in the teaching - learning process, conflict and disasters caused by natural hazards, lack of political commitment and politicization of the system etc. Of the problem of out-of-schoolchildren is to be solved. These inadequacies had to be sorted out.
In accordance with provisions of Young Persons and Childrens Act, a child is a person under the age of 14 years and the Act prohibits employment of children. The Department of Labour receives over two hundred complaints of child labour every month.
The majority of the boys engaged in child labour are from rural areas working as agricultural and low-technology sector workers while the girls are mostly used as domestic aides in urban areas.
As the study has pointed out, poverty has a significant impact on the lives of children who often have poor health and are less likely to have access to higher education. The Government must look into this issue on a priority basis.
Health
Sri Lanka is having a free and universal healthcare system. It scores higher than the regional average in healthcare having a high life expectancy and a lower maternal and infant deaths. It is known for having one of the worlds earliest known healthcare systems and has its own indigenous medicine system.
Family Health Bureau (FHB) is the focal point for Maternal and Child Health (MCH) in Sri Lanka. The system had been well developed and effective in delivering preventive and promotive maternal and child health services to the population and had been highly spoken of as a model for other developing countries.
Education
Sri Lankas education system is considered as one of the best in the region. In fact, the education facilities in Sri Lanka have improved dramatically since independence. School education in Sri Lanka is compulsory to age 14 of which the first 5 years are spent in primary school. At the end of this there is an optional scholarship examination that may permit access to a superior grade of school.
The State provides a number of vocational and technical training centres, and programes for apprenticeship training too. These take place within a system of seven levels of qualifications, of which the upper one is rated equivalent to State degree level. There are also a variety of tertiary academic institutions where programes may be followed that range from one-year certificates through to doctorates.
Grey areas
However, this near image of perfection in the education sector hides some grey areas that are related to discipline, to discrimination, and the right of self-expression.
Sri Lanka expressed its commitment to prohibiting all corporal punishment of children, including in the home, at the July 2006 meeting of the South Asia Forum, following the 2005 regional consultation of the UN Study on Violence against Children. By now, 51 countries have banned corporal punishment. UN Committee on the Rights of the Child calls physical punishment, however slight, invariably degrading. It does more harm than good. In Sri Lanka, however, prohibition is still be achieved.
The second grey point- discrimination  also need to be studied. Unfortunately, some forms of discrimination still persist, especially children with disabilities or special needs. Data on children with disabilities are very limited and difficult to access but it is an obvious fact these children experience widespread violations of their rights. A very small percentage of all handicapped children begin school yet, and of them, majority drop out due to unpleasant experiences.
A survey in 2012 indicated that there were 88,740 mentally and physically handicapped children between the ages of 5 -19 years, of which 62% were receiving education through mainstream schooling, and 34% had not received any form of education. These statistics indicated that the handicapped children with multiple and intellectual disabilities abstain from attending schools. This was because public and private provision of education lacks expertise and capacity to deal with such children.
If we are talking about Inclusive Education, then we should recognize every childs fundamental right to learn. The education system should provide equal opportunities to all children and attempt to alter school culture, policies and practices to accommodate differences in learning and physical abilities of children. This matter also needs the attention of the Government.
Another grey area is the right of children to express their opinions. We have excluded children from participation in matters that affect them. Ask any parent or teacher. The answers are consistent. Children lack competence; they lack knowledge and judgement; involving them in decisions is to place too heavy a burden on them; parents and teachers know what is best for their children; giving children a voice will lead to excessive demands, bad behaviour, disrespect for elders; participation will expose children to risk of harm.
However, time and again, experience shows that children  even very young children  given the time and opportunity, demonstrate not only that they have views, experiences and perspectives to express, but that their expression can contribute positively to decisions that affect the realisation of their rights and well-being.
We use discipline, which does not encourage children to express their own ideas but rather reinforces their feeling of being constantly bullied.
NPEVAC
So, where do we take it from here. Minister of Women and Child Affairs recently said that the Government has decided to introduce a new policy document on child care, child protection and child alternative care, to support necessary amendments to the Children (Judicial Protection) Bill.
We have proposed to include a bill of rights in the Constitution with a special clause to include child rights and protection, she said at the launch of the National Partnership to End Violence against Children (NPEVAC).
NPEVAC, a new initiative to end violence against children by 2030 is a collaborative partnership between the Government, UN agencies, international organisations, civil society, faith groups, the private sector, the media, children and other key stakeholders. This partnership to end violence against children creates a vital window of opportunity for Sri Lanka to discuss challenges and exchange knowledge. This is a commendable move.
If this partnership is going to be a success, it must develop a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency and multi-pronged approach. This approach should include child centric policies and practices in all matters pertaining to children, emphasis on training and development of all professionals working with children, inter-agency collaboration and a strong partnership with parents and the public.
Let us hope the NPEVAC partnership will understand that children are human beings and are the subject of their own rights. First of all, the Partnership must offer a vision of the child as an individual and as a member of a family and community, with rights and responsibilities appropriate to his or her age and stage of development. By recognizing childrens rights in this way, the Partnership can firmly set the focus on the whole child.

Fertiliser subsidies for farmers were not deposited in their bank accounts as promised by the government. If the government breach their promise further, farmers will launch another struggle after five days, All Island Farmers Alliance and Provincial Councillor Chairman Namal Karunarathna said.
He was addressing a press conference held at the Dambulla Siyapatha Hotel recently.
Karunarathna said the government is trying to suppress farmers' rights. He said the farmers have to struggle to gain their rights. "We made several protests to win our rights in the past and succeeded in gaining some of them. Another struggle will be launched to gain the fertiliser subsidies," he said.
He said sufficient rice and paddy stocks are available until next February. "The Auditor Generals report has proved it. But the stocks are remaining in private sector. The rice market has limited only to a few large -scale paddy millers. The entire monopoly of rice market was grabbed by the private sector. The government, meanwhile, permitted to import poison mixed rice and now the people have to consume poisonous rice," he said.
"The government has power to pull out rice stocks from the private sector and release them to the open market.
"They did not do that because they can gain something from the way it operates," he said.
All Island Farmers Alliance Secretary T.D. Sarath, Minipe Farmer Foundation Chairman A.M.W. Bandara and Dambulla United Farmer Foundation Chairman Sunil Ranaweera participated.

Half Girlfriend: Beacon on Bhagats brand of sympathy
First we had Three Idiots which became a roaring success at the box office. Hello, Kai Po Che and 2 States followed. Now it is yet another Chetan Bhagat book which is converted into a movie that has taken on the wide screen.
Half Girlfriend originates from Bhagats novel of the same name. The story rotates around Simrao boy, Madhav, who is struck by a thunderbolt when he spots the Delhi lass Riya.
Half Girlfriend is definitely not one of Bhagats best works. It seems a mystery what these two characters share in common when he can barely speak a sentence in English while she acts like a British import. Even if both go for each others looks the tiresome and clingy manner in which Madhav hangs onto Riya would put any smart girl off a guy for good. However both seem to find common grounds in basketball and music. Thus an alliance forms which heads towards something which can be termed as a strange relationship.
You get many episodes which have been repeated in previous Bhaghat works. For example Riya unwinds on top of a peak - India Gate. This is a common feature in many of Bhagats heroes and heroines. Likewise despite his handicap Madhav wins the day though he does not strike out as the boyfriend many girls would like to take home to their mother.
Mohit Suri has included a few fun moments in Half Girlfriend. The comic bits come from watching Madhav desperately trying out ways to make Riya his full time girlfriend but only ends up getting her approval to be his half girlfriend.
Commitment-phobic
You almost see a dj vu performance from Arjun Kapoor from the one he gave life to in 2 States as Krish Malhotra. For those who enjoyed 2 States purely because of Alia Bhatts spunky performance Kapoors performance in Half Girlfriend is tiresome to watch. He needs to get away from these stereotype roles and show his acting prowess through more energetic characters.
Shraddha Kapoor does not deliver a significant performance as Riya. Viewers are suppose to be mesmerized by the free spirited dame but they are left baffled on what has become of Madhav so that he leaves his mother, their school and the gorgeous girl he begins to associate with on rebound to chase Riya across the world. It seems frustrating that Riyas commitment-phobic nature is overdone in the film.
Only Vikrant Massey seems to give a pitch perfect performance as Shailesh, Madhavs college buddy who gives sound advice. He is the one who notes that Madhavs infatuation will turn into a fatal attraction some day.
Lacks reality
The film lacks reality as well. For instance the story goes to show that it is a cake walk to obtain a U S visa for an Indian. Madhav might have gotten a chance through his association with the Bill Gates Foundation but it is a mystery how Riya made it to an American Jazz bar.
One of the plus points in Half Girlfriend is that it is fast paced. However this seems to make the characters forget what they were talking about in the previous scene. The music is not worth a mention because only Manoj Muntashirs Phir Bhi Main Tumko Chahoonga comes to mind. The rest of the music and lyrics are forgettable.

Housemaid receives Rs. 4.9 m  as arrears of unpaid wages
A housemaid named Gnaparagasm Nishanthini of Eravur, who had been employed in a house in Saudi Arabia for 15 years without a salary, has received Rs. 4l.9 million as arrears of pay due to the intervention of Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
This is the biggest salary arrears received by an expatriate worker in the history of the foreign employment sector.
Nishanthini, born on December 11, 1986, had gone to Saudi Arabia in 2000 at the age of 14 without registering at the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment.
She had been employed at the same residence for 15 years but her employer had not paid her any salary. In 2005, she had gone and obtained refuge at the Suraksha Womens Welfare Centre maintained at the Sri Lanka Embassy in Saudi Arabia. Minister Athukorala, who came to know about her predicament, had directed the labour consultant at the Sri Lanka Embassy to lodge a complaint to the Saudi Labour Ministry about the matter.
The Saudi Labour Ministry had obtained a payment of Saudi Riyal 123,400 equivalent to SL Rs. 4,936,000 as arrears of pay to her. The Saudi Government was taking legal action against the errant employer.

CCTV cameras at bus standsto curb extortion demands
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva yesterday said the National Transport Commission (NTC) has taken 2,095 files to the FCID to investigate into various malpractices which had occurred when granting bus route permits during the previous regime.
The minister noted that the regulation of the transport sector had become a major issue.
It is a problem whether we can control it through legal,ethical or other means under good governance, he added.
A large number of people come to me every day for a route permit and I have to turn them back.
I tell them, come to me only if you are prepared to adhere to the principles of good governance. I cannot grant permits in an illegal manner, the minister said at a workshop on the strengthening of the national and provincial transport sector at Waters Edge.
The minister told provincial authorities that extortion from bus owners by thugs and other influential people was still rampant.
Thus the minister urged provincial authorities to install CCTV cameras at bus stands to curb the issue of buses still being subjected to extortion demands.
The NTC will fund the initiative, he added. It was also noted that long distance buses stop at undesignated places and that CCTV would also help put a stop to that, the Minister said.

## Title: Impact of UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka

Impact of UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka
The claimed justification of insurrectional violence and the proportionality of the State Reaction is a conundrum that faces all Member States in the UN.
Identification of transgressions based on reliable evidence and remedial action through credible judicial mechanisms is the need of the hour.
By nominating the need for an ad hoc hybrid court, the UN High Commissioner has pre-judged that offences of the nature of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity have taken place during the thirty year period of the conflict.
The High Commissioner has chosen to ignore that many Sri Lankans have served with distinction as judges, prosecutor and investigators in international courts.

Two public statements on 6th June 2017, one by the current United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Hayley at the UN HRC and other by the British Prime Minister, Theresa May impel me to write this article.
Ambassador Hayley spoke after ZeidRaadai-Hussein criticized Israel for the 50-year occupation of Palestine, and said that the United States was looking very carefully at the HRC and US participation in the Council. The Ambassador continued It is very hard to accept that this Council has never considered a Resolution on Venezuela, and it adopted five biased Resolutions in March against a single country, Israel and that It is essential that this Council address its chronic anti-Israel bias if it is to have any credibility.
The British Prime Minister speaking outside 10 Downing Street, declared that enough is enough and that there was far too much tolerance of extremism in response to a terror attack in London and promised a strengthening of counter terrorism strategy. This statement follows a pledge last year [quote] every effort must be made to stop British soldiers from falling victim to abuse of the legal system by lawyers representing Iraqis who allege they were victims of war crimes during the occupation of their country.
While I do not endorse either stance, it is pertinent to observe that the major planks of the UNHRC Resolution on Sri Lanka, supported by the US and Britain, namely,
i. Requesting the GOSL to fully implement the recommendations based on the report of the UN High Commissioner,
ii. Encouraging continued engagement with the High Commissioner and the relevant procedure mandate holders in the promotion and protection of human rights and truth justice, reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka,
iii. Requesting High Commissioner and the relevant mandate holders [in consultation with the concurrence with the GOSL] to strengthen their advice and technical assistance,
iv. Requesting the High Commissioner to continue assessing progress on the implementation of its recommendations and to present an updated report to the UNHCR at the fortieth Session.
It is probable their strong support, may have been underpinned by political pressure brought on the two HRC Members by local pressure groups in their own countries rather than an unbiased assessment of the situation in Sri Lanka.
Having participated in the process of Resolution drafting, moving amendments and canvassing support for Sri Lanka as a delegate to the Human Rights fora during the 1983 to 1991 period, I am aware of the interaction of the multi faced interest groups that pressurise member states in one direction or another.
On March 23, 2017 the UNHRC adopted a consensus resolution HRC 43/1 on Sri Lanka giving time until 2019 to achieve reconciliation and transitional justice, by Promoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka.
Before we commence an examination of the text of the UN Resolution, it would, in my opinion, useful to recall that unlike the judgement of a judicial tribunal, which determines factual issues relevant to a dispute and directs remedial action in specific terms, a UNHRC Resolution only recommends mechanisms to redress breaches of human rights.
It should be borne in mind that the UNHRC, which in 2006 replaced the Commission on Human Rights maintained the basic framework of the Commission, was a UN body mandated to monitor the protection of human rights on a global review and to halt an ongoing transgression or to avert a looming catastrophe by emergency action or to examine serious violations in a period preceding a report with a view to recommending measures to prevent recurrence. These measures could include mechanisms of restorative and retributory justice.
The UNHRC consists of 47 member states elected by the UN General Assembly for three year terms and shared by regional groups. While it is understood that a Member State which engages in gross and systematic violation of Human Rights could be denied membership of the UNHRC, such action has only occurred once and that too was a suspension of membership for about nine months.
It would also be useful to keep in mind that the Council consists of Member States and not of independent experts and that the contribution to the text of a Resolution is a reflection of political reality prevailing in each of the Member States and catering to the varied interest groups results in the on the one hand this but on the other hand that found in the text of a Resolution.
The High Commissioners Report [par 1273] recognizes that Likewise, there must be recognition within the Tamil community, for example, of the destruction and harm inflicted on civilians and communities by the LTTE. While the LTTE no longer exists nor controls territory, the legacy of the abuses, committed by and large with total impunity, remains and must be addressed. Even now, in some parts of Sri Lanka, those who were the victims of abuses by the LTTE are still afraid to talk about what happened in the presence of former LTTE cadres. It is a moot question whether this exercise would produce any worthwhile results.
The GOSL should be vary that UNHRC Resolutions often use the velvet glove to recognize that the implementation of the measures recommended should be as far as the domestic legislation permits, with the concealed iron fist that a State is obliged to bring its domestic laws within the parameters of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, and customary International Law.
The sponsors of the Resolution have stated that the Resolution was to support the GOSL to adopt such measures as would achieve reconciliation and justice in Sri Lanka as a means of ensuring a non-recurrence of conflict and strengthening democratic governance and freedoms for all Sri Lankans.
It would be clear that the UN, representing the international polity requests the GOSL to obtain evidence of any war crimes committed during the relevant period and to place any evidence that prima facie appears credible before a competent judicial tribunal, identifying persons responsible for such transgressions and significantly denying such persons immunity for their actions and deal with them according to law.
The Resolution underscores the words, reconciliation and transitional justice. We need then to identify what the resolution contemplated by those words.
The concept of transitional justice has evolved from the judicial processes required to remedy gross human rights violation committed by dictatorial regimes and war crimes and large scale abuses of human rights, to the current processes of establishment of judicial processes for reparation of war torn societies.
Coupling transitional justice with reconciliation indicates that the primary focus of the community of nations is on the creation and establishment of credible initiatives of fact finding as a means of promoting reunification of a society disrupted by a period of violent armed conflict, with the concomitant loss of human life.
The text of Resolution HRC 34/1
The purported objective of the resolution is forward focussed. As stated in its caption the recommendation contained in the Resolution is are base for the establishment of a framework within which all the people in Sri Lanka could enjoy the full exercise of their fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Resolution recalls previous Resolutions on the subject, reaffirms that  it is the responsibility of each State to ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of its entire population, and reiterates the commitment of the UNHRC  to the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka, recognizing that it is primarily a task to be performed by the GOSL.
UN Resolutions usually commence with Preambular paragraphs which state the reasons for which the HRC is addressing a particular issue and highlight past international action on the topic.
The preambular paragraphs of the instant Resolution, first signal appreciation of the GOSL permitting visits by delegations representing the several UN Organisations, and welcoming the steps taken by the GOSL to implement the recommendations contained in the Resolution of 2015. The tone tightens slightly on the need for further progress on issues that remain unimplemented.
Balancing the concern, Clauses 1 to 8, acknowledge the peaceful transition of power both at the Presidential Election of 2015 and the Parliamentary Elections later that year and the consequent steps of advancing respect for human rights, good governance and the establishment of democratic institutions.
Clause 9 commences a possible inroad into the affairs of a sovereign State, it commences with congratulatory phrases about the mechanisms set up to  Investigate allegations of bribery, corruption, fraud, and abuses of power, the language strengthens to  and stressing the importance of such investigations and the prosecution of those responsible in ending impunity and promoting good governance, to foreshadow the subsequent stress on the importance of such investigations and the prosecution of those responsible in ending impunity that is found in the text of the later Clauses 15 to 18.
A slightly less positive tone is found in Clauses 10 and 11, where praise for restoration of the civilian administration in the North and the East, the demining and resettling of persons displaced by the years of conflict resulting in the improvement of the environment which defenders of human rights and promoters of civil society now enjoy, is somewhat soured by the reference to reports of ongoing violations and abuses of human rights.
In Clause 12 the UNHRC declares Reaffirming that all Sri Lankans are entitled to the full enjoyment of their human rights regardless of religion, belief or ethnicity, in a peaceful and unified land. The last two words, unified land reflect the recognition that separation of the State is not the solution to the problems faced by the Sri Lankan people.
While recognizing the right of a State to protect itself from terrorism, the text in Clause [13] continuesStates must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, as applicable.
This appears to be the toe-hold for the call to repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act. The UNHRC recognizes that a sovereign State has the jurisdiction to draw the line between legitimate protest and resort to violence to pressurise the State to redress the alleged grievances, but cautions that State action to quell the threats must remain within the parameters prescribed in the UN Instruments relating to preservation, promotion and protection of the Human Rights of individuals or groups.
This reference targets the Prevention of Terrorism Act [1978] and the subsequent modifications of that Act. Examinations of the provisions of this Act and amendment, repeal or replacement of the Act is recognized as being within the domestic jurisdiction. Perhaps with the unstated caveat that in the context of a State being obliged to bring its laws within the restrictions of Human Rights as are permitted by International Humanitarian Law.
This perhaps is the conundrum that faces any State.
Repression (or the perceived repression) of fundamental rights and freedoms of the people, whether as groups or as individuals, by the State in which they reside, needs be rectified by resort to democratic processes of recourse to free elections or firm judicial remedy.
The failure of either results in action that the aggrieved refer to as fights for freedom and the State refers to as acts of Terrorism, or insurrection.
The distinction is in the eye of the beholder.
The extent to which a State could restrict human rights in anti-terrorism action appears to be echoed by the British Prime Minister when she said enough is enough:
Recasting the content of the 2015 Resolution
Three mechanisms have been devised to reinforce the content of the 2015 Resolution to the operative content of the 2017 Resolution, one, to recall the measures recommended in that Resolution, two, to welcome the positive engagement of the GOSL with the High Commissioner since October 2015, and third, to request the High Commissioner to continue with the engagement.
Accordingly the Operative Clauses need be read with the recommendations in the 2015 Resolution.
The purpose of the request for co-operation between the GOSL and the UN High Commissioner is set out as the  promotion and protection of human rights and truth, justice, reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka and to provide technical assistance in the areas of the promotion of Human Rights, truth, justice, reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, is diluted by the words  in consultation and with the concurrence of the GOSL
The words  in consultation and with the concurrence of the GOSL would be of significance in the interpretation of the terms of the operative paragraphs that follow.
Placing the GOSL under scrutiny
The Resolution also places the GOSL under the supervision of the UN High Commissioner by the indirect pressure of the High Commissioner being mandated to scrutinize compliance by the GOSL and to provide a comprehensive report with the discussion of the report being placed on the agenda for the fortieth session of the HRC.
As stated at the beginning of this presentation, as recently as June 6, 2017, United States, one of the principal movers of the Resolution, openly accused the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein as being partisan and anti-Israeli. Whether the statement has merit or not it must impact on the issue of impartiality at least in the eyes of a major sponsor of the Resolution on Sri Lanka. It would wrong for a Member State which has concerns for the impartiality of a UN High Commissioner to persuade another Member State to accept a finding by the High Commissioner without due caution.
What reasons are given in the Resolution for the measures recommended
The arguments for and against maintaining, amending, repealing and or replacement of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 1978 (and the subsequent modifications) are too complex to be presented herein and are best left for another day.

Informatics Holdings facilitates Brand Fundamentals workshop with Nicholas Khne
Brand Fundamentals, a workshop towards growing Sri Lankan brands, jointly organized by Informatics Holdings Ltd and the Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) was held on May 30 at Ramada, Colombo.
Focusing on creating, managing and growing brand value, the event conducted by renowned brand consultant Nicholas Khne, saw a large number of enthusiasts including business owners, senior executives, marketing directors and entrepreneurs representing the apparel, construction and IT-BPO industries actively participate.
Following a step-by-step process on building powerful brands, the workshop also covered pertinent topics such as digital in brand building as well as the generational transition in family owned businesses.
The founder and owner of brand consultancy Wunderbrand, Nicholas Khne has a BA in Marketing Communications from the University of Johannesburg, a Chartered Marketer his consulting experience spanning over 15 years includes a client portfolio of renowned brands in Africa, the Gulf as well as the sub continent.
Having played an integral role in making Nandos one of the best success stories in Africa, Khne also launched Comedy Central in the region. The idea for this workshop was born during one of the keynote speeches delivered by Khne in Mauritius.
His insightful take on Creating Great African Brands was seen by Informatics Holdings as an area that was timely, relevant and easily translatable into a Sri Lankan context.
Speaking on the need for a masterclass in brand building, Group Managing Director of Informatics Holdings, Hiran Wickramasinghe said, As a homegrown company, at Informatics we are well attuned to the needs local industries, not only from an IT perspective but also from the point of view of the challenges they face with global brands. A workshop on brand strategy, especially seen through the lens of an emerging market as opposed to the usual UK and US brands was a much needed forum.
Khne said, I believe that the world shouldnt rely solely on brands from the US or Europe. And for brands from emerging markets to be successful, they need to make brand strategy a core area of focus. However the cost to do so is generally a hurdle, and through this workshop conducted in partnership with Informatics Holdings and IIT, I hope to eliminate that to some extent.

IPM Great HR Practices 2017: A new initiative  to recognize results driven outcomes
Over the years, the Human Resource Management (HRM) discipline has played a significant role in adding value to organizations.
Such contributions are widely known and published in the global literature, most prominent being practices emanating from the developed world. Although many novel and value-adding HR practices have emerged in the Sri Lankan HR landscape, there is still a lacuna in the domain of literature relating to Great HR Practices in Sri Lanka.
In view of this, the organizing committee of the NHRC 2017 has initiated a meaningful new addition to this years conference - Great HR Practices which aims at bridging this information gap that prevails in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, presentations by 4 Sri Lankan corporates on four selected best practices in HR, in line with this years conference theme will be showcased to the countrys HR fraternity at the National HR Conference 2017 as a featured event. It is envisaged that this new segment would further enhance the level of HR awareness among the countrys business leaders thereby facilitating greater organizational efficiency, productivity and employee engagement across the workplaces.
The National HR Conference is a platform created by IPM Sri Lanka to raise the bar on human resource management by sharing knowledge, best practices and insights. The Great HR Practices 2017 is an innovative initiative that will further enhance the value of the NHRC by helping to share HR related best practices that have been deployed by Sri Lankan companies to drive results driven outcomes, said Ken Vijayakumar, Chairman of the NHRC 2017 Organizing Committee.
Great HR Practices is a special knowledge sharing forum where the participating organizations will present their Great HR Practices at the proceedings of the NHRC 2017. The 4 companies were selected based on a structured evaluation process by an eminent panel of HR practitioners and academics.
The evaluation takes into consideration the originality of the particular HR practice, its effectiveness and sustainability, and most importantly its extent of value creation within the business landscape. These great HR practices are those that have been initiated during the past 5 years and are currently ongoing.
The Great HR Practices 2017 Project is co-chaired by Samantha Rathnayake, Management Consultant, Postgraduate Institute of Management, University of Sri Jayewardenepura and Dr. Jayantha Pathiratne, Management Consultant.
The four companies that have been selected to present their Great HR Practices are Standard Chartered Bank on Employee Engagement, Polytex Garments Ltd on Industrial Relations, DSI Samson Group on Employee Motivation through Rewards and Camso Loadstar (Pvt) Ltd on Performance Management.

Kanrich Finance wins AREA award
Kanrich Finance Limited (KFL), won an AREA award at Asias leading large-scale and regional CSR programme, organized by Enterprise Asia, for its CSR initiative, 'Kanrich Thaksalawa'.
A licenced finance company with a history of over 44 years, this initiative was developed with a goal of providing free English education for rural students.
The project was piloted in 2016 to provide an opportunity to less fortunate children of the companys under privileged customers in Sri Lanka.
The programme currently serves over 400 children.
The project was initiated with a strong vision of being able to advance the countrys future generation, providing opportunities to these children to access global environments, developing them into the future leaders of tomorrow.
Experienced and qualified teachers were hired by the company who were involved in teaching students from various levels with a goal of bringing them up to high standards.
Each students standard or level is closely evaluated via the extension of tests and examinations, which is used as a tool to identify whom to pay more attention to.
The students are also being put through a practical session to develop their communication and presentation skills, said Assistant General Manger Shyaminie Fernando.
This free service is currently provided to students starting from the Grade 6 and will be continued until the student passes on to Grade 10, thereby collating enough time to build a strong relationship and genuinely assisting the student in reaching at the ultimate desired level.
This project intends attaining the corporate mission in being a responsible corporate entity in the industry, thereby being a unique initiation for the company where extended support and a sense of encouragement is provided to Kanrichs customer base.
As an expansion plan, Kanrich also has made provisions for a second phase of the project in providing learning opportunities for a further 1,800 children via the implementation of 50 study centres across the country within the year 2017.
Further, in incorporating a sense of innovation, Kanrich also has ideas in the provision of a mobile library for the students in view of further improving their reading and understanding skills effectively. The ultimate goal of this project is to create one million future leaders from the rural community by 2025.

A kick for a sick lift: See ya later escalator!
My column last week dealt with my stark fear of lifts. Yes, I did concede that I have a considerable phobia of riding them. I also admitted I suffer from claustrophobia and am terrified for a number of reasons of stepping into an air-tight metal box the size of a luxury toilet cubicle, which is devoid of a loo when you become stuck and incontinent with downright fright and lose control of your bladder.
I agree that there may be no single invention that shaped the modern megapolis as much as the lift and has enabled cities to push continually skywards. Ok, I acknowledge they are a marvel of progress and are innovatively designed with safety features. But I still hate them. So I take steps to avoid them. I agree they are a convenient source of mobility when you consider the ups and downs of their use in high rises.
Sometimes, they are not on the up and up. Lifts, as one elfin designer friend so pithily described them, are like dress shirts, you can button up or button down. Yet a lift is one of the most uncomfortable places to be in. Essentially, youre stuck in a tiny room, surrounded by strangers, with the air oozing of awkward silence.
The single most ruthlessly uncomfortable aspect of lift rides is that there is nowhere to escape. Bad breath, bad jokes, body odour and bad attitudes are all amplified in spaces where people are trapped with no means for relief until the car mercifully reaches their floor.
Personally speaking, having lived in concrete jungles comprising high-rises in countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong and the lifts to success have often been out of order. Yet, unless I have to travel in a stratospheric direction with the sky the limit, I am usually constrained to use the stairs ... one step at a time.
Fear impels me to adhere strictly to the signs on the stairways whether there is an emergency of an impending inferno or not: In case of fire do not use lift. I take out my marker pen and mischievously scrawl a slight amendment under the sign: USE WATER!
Grand-daughter Moya 13, and seemingly going on 22, appears to be the brightest family spark in the cynical department. She posted a rebuttal to me on my last weeks column in which I mentioned: As in the case of many others I am always impatient while waiting for a lift. I am a firm believer that many lifts work on the pressure you exert on the call button. So punching it a 100 times will make it arrive a lot faster.
I quote a part of her scathing missive verbatim: Darling Dada, Sarcasm and stupidity sometimes meet in a lift. If you press the lift button three times after its been already pressed do you really imagine it will go into hurry mode What cheek! I was seriously considering disowning the family brat despite her attractive hazel eyes and a peaches and cream complexion.
I fired back: Yes Moya Baby, life is like a lift. On your way up or down you sometimes have to stop and let some people off. I am seriously considering the prospect of renouncing our relationship the same way.
Sri Lankans refer to these contraptions as lifts as in the Brit equivalent while the Yanks call them escalators. I believe both names are problematic misnomers. Think about it. Both lift and elevator would seem to refer only to upward motion. The same goes for ascending room and escalator. Would someone please enlighten me on what you call the darn thing when it is going down
I do not vouch for the veracity of this story spun by an Indian journalistic colleague in Hong Kong named Rajaram. Yevery day has its ups and downs, says Rajaram. He claims he entered a posh hotel and a bevy of attractive women was already inside. Rajaram says: I mentioned my floor saying: Ballroom please. To which the lady standing in front of him replied: Im sorry, I didnt realise I was crowding you.
I suffered a traumatic experience in a Singapore condominium lift with two expatriate women and three school kids inside. Suddenly the darn contrivance came to a shuddering halt on the 6th floor and the lights flickered and went out. Terrified, I hit the emergency button and someone answered. I explained that we were stuck and queried: So, do these things have an air supply The guy answered: Erm. I think so. Some consolation I thought as I answered him: Yeah, me too mate.
We all shared a laugh, but it was one of nervousness. I started to feel lightheaded and hot. We had been in for about two minutes. I began to worry about the oxygen supply, so I prised open the doors. Fresh air piled through the doors. I took a huge gulp of air, something I had rationed until this point. But now I was starting to get into full-blown panic mode although I resisted the urge to yell because of consideration for the three kids inside.
I suddenly realised that the most important thing to do when youre in a stuck lift is to stay calm. Ive seen people go from complete cool demeanour to raving insanity in such situations. Who am I kidding, I am that person. So do as I say and not as I do.
I glanced at the kids and they looked at me for guidance. The little boy slipped his hand into mine for reassurance. Suddenly I felt a calm enveloping me and I said with more hope than faith: There is nothing to be scared of because I am Batman in disguise. And Batman doesnt let his friends down. Ill get us out of here soon.
The kids smiled for the first time in those harrowing three minutes or so. I then asked them all to move back and in that confounded confined space charged the door and slammed it hard with my heel. To everyones astonishment the doors slid open, shut again and the lift began moving.
It was actually going down to the ground floor. It opened and the kids and the women rushed through not giving the lift a chance to trap us again. The maintenance crew was at hand to greet us. As we escaped the kids told them their services werent needed because Batman had rescued them.
The kids looked at me with worshipful eyes while thanking me for the help. So did the two ladies. I nodded my head in modest acceptance.
As I sauntered out of the lobby I simply addressed the lift while waxing poetic: See ya later escalator. And thanks for saving me from being a public urinator!

Lamudi Lanka hosts Real Estate Expo
Leading property portal Lamudi Lanka (Pvt) Ltd. hosts its third Real Estate Expo this weekend. The event is set to provide direct access to the real estate world with a range of presenters and exhibitors showcasing Sri Lankas best property and home services to buyers, sellers and investors.
The third Expo is scheduled to take place on June 17 and 18 at the North Lawn, Taj Samudra from 10am to 7pm on both days.
The show will provide property seekers the chance to view the latest upcoming projects, meet leading real estate experts and obtain reliable services all at once.
Recognized as a leading online portal for properties, Lamudi states that one of the main objectives of the real estate expo is to reach out to property seekers who do not have internet access. Even though the countrys internet penetration is rising, there are still many people who do not have access to the internet on a daily basis. Therefore the real estate expo will be a hotspot for offline property hunters to discover the infinite opportunities available in the real estate industry. The rapidly evolving real estate in Sri Lanka
The relaxation of regulations regarding the buying of property and lands for locals and foreigners are continuously encouraging local buyers and foreign investments. The increasing internet penetration (27%) in the country is leading to increasing numbers of online property seekers in particular.
Thanks to technological advancements which have contributed to the improvements of Sri Lankan economy, the country is now exposed to multiple global opportunities, thus making it one of the most desirable destinations to purchase a home/apartment, invest, and foster new businesses.
Records and statistics from the past few years show that Colombo is the prime city where most property seekers and investors are interested in purchasing real estate. However, as a result of rapid urbanization, properties within the citys limits are commanding very high prices, directing people to purchase properties in the outskirts as well as in Kandy, Galle, Rajagiriya, Dehiwala, and others.
Lamudi believes that the third real estate expo will be an ideal spot for property seekers to find their properties and for investors to discover better investment opportunities all under one roof. The event intends to provide developers with the opportunity to showcase their latest developments to a large crowd.
In addition to browsing and discovering a wide range of properties, visitors are also able to meet esteemed real estate experts directly and discuss their requirements to obtain reliable services and offers. Developers will be showcasing their projects in the form of 3D models giving potential buyers a clear vision of properties.

Lankan apartments overpriced - Skyline
Skyline Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd which has invested Rs. 400 million for Skyline Kotte apartments at Bangala Junction, Kotte, has reached its final phase of construction. It will be unveiled by December, 2017.
The property built by team of young engineers offers the 30-unit luxury apartment complex provides five-star living at an affordable price.
A unique feature of the project is that it has being built without any pre-sales.
We invested Rs. 400 million with 65% borrowings and using our own capital as we wanted to give the customer a near completed apartment unit rather than asking the customer to buy a property only looking at drawings and computer images, said Director, Skyline Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd., Dinul Wijethunga.
The project built on six floors will have a rooftop swimming pool, sauna, jacuzzi, spa and gymnasium and imported mahogany and steel finish fittings to offer luxury.
We have paid great attention to detail in identifying simple conveniences and merging them with value offerings to introduce what we believe is a milestone in the housing industry, said Matarage Real Estate Consultants (which is handling the marketing) Anoma Matarage.
Skyline Kotte also features a dual-elevator system, parking with separate entrance and exit, 24-hour security and surveillance, vending machines and Pin access and video surveillance in each apartment.
An engineer by profession he said that they observed that many of their competitors in the industry keep huge margins and in contrast they wishes to keep a small profit and give a better deal for the buyer. We do not want to be overpriced.
He also said that they are looking at other investments in the hospitality training and restaurants sector and apartments in the future in Colombo and Gampaha.
Apartments range in three categories from 1,301 sq.ft. to 1,434 sq.ft., and include three bedrooms, three bathrooms, kitchen, living area and three balconies. The starting price from Rs. 19.9 million.
Designed by Team Architrave and constructed by Dwellco (Pvt) Ltd, Skyline Property Developers (Pvt) Ltd have partnered with pioneers in the field of architecture and design to ensure it appeals to residents accustomed to the highest world-class standards.
Pre-sales commenced last month and with only 20 apartment units remaining, potential buyers are offered a 5-10% discount upon half or full upfront payment.

Leave for England today for ICC Womens World Cup: Spin oriented Sri Lanka looking for helpful pitches
Sri Lanka Women cricketers head coach Hemantha Devapriya hopes for dry weather and helpful pitches that would suit his team laden with spin in the upcoming ICC Womens Cricket World Cup in England.
At the moment its cold 17 degrees hopefully if the sun comes out it will be helpful. Those are things we cant control. Our success will depend on getting a good score on the board and our key is spin. We select batters upto 6 and we have two spinners coming in Ama (Kanchana) and Shashikala (Siriwardene), said Devapriya.
You can swing the ball in the first 10 overs or so and once the swing goes our bowlers are not going to be that effective to get the batsmen out. We have two left-arm spinners as well and sometimes if the fast bowlers fail we may have to go with spin. We are going with a positive frame of mind to score runs and get wickets, he said.
The return of experienced all-rounder and former captain Sashikala Siriwardene to the side from injury Devapriya said would certainly make a big impact on the team.
Her return has strengthened the team a lot. She will make a big impact because she is an all-rounder and she has the experience also. Her experience will be very useful in the middle, said Devapriya.
Our aim is to try and finish in the top four we have a fair chance of doing that. When you compare us with other teams they are well ahead of us but you never know in a tournament of this nature.
According to Devapriya Sri Lanka has prepared well for this tournament ironing out most of their faults and it is now upto the players to deliver in the middle.
Since I took over six months ago Ive found out that our run rate has not been that great and our batters strike rate was not so efficient. Other than (Eshani) Lokusuriyage and (Chamari) Atapattu who had strike rates of little over 60, others were below that some under 40 which indicated that if Atapattu and Lokusuriyage scored we managed over 200 runs, observed Devapriya.
What they were lacking was creative shots and use of the feet. They were averaging only 41 singles per match. We worked on it and they improved it to 100 singles. We increased their shot range also like using the pace of the ball. They were very negative on back of the length balls and not creating a shot off that delivery. We practiced with hard plastic balls on granite surfaces to overcome that lapse. We also played a lot of practice games with under 17 boys and in the last two games we managed to get over 200 runs, he said.
Another area Devapriya said they worked hard at was the fitness. Fitness was a big problem I had especially with ageing players. When you are not fit it affects the fielding. Gradually we increased their workload fitness coupled with fielding. At gym sessions we introduced new exercises to develop the technique to generate power when batting. Overall I had only six months and I never expected them to reach this standard, they developed very fast and their confidence has gone up.
Sri Lanka will play three practice games against India, England and a county side before their first World Cup match against New Zealand on June 24.
SRI LANKA WOMEN SQUAD: Inoka Ranaweera (captain), Prasadani Weerakkody (vice-captain), Chamari Atapattu, Chamari Polgampola, Shashikala Siriwardene, Dilani Manodara, Chandima Gunaratne, Nipuni Hansika, Ama Kanchana, Eshani Lokusuriyage, Harshitha Madavi, Hasini Perera, Udeshika Prabodhani, Oshadi Ranasinghe, Sripali Weerakkody.

Lest we forget
The 27th commemoration of the massacre of the 400 policemen who were mowed down by the LTTE after they had surrendered to the terrorists on the instructions of the then government was held on Sunday in Ampara with a multi-religious ceremony and attended by the loved ones of the departed policemen. This harrowing incident, which marked one of the blackest episodes of the 30 year civil war, in all too familiar fashion, is now erased from the memories of the general public.They have gone to their unmarked graves unsung and unwept.
No inquiry was held to get to the bottom of this incident nor any individual or individuals called to account for this most barbaric mass massacre of our men in uniform. One would have thought that the Rajapaksa regime would price open this matter, if for nothing else but to gain political mileage from the fact that the incident occurred under a UNP regime. But the former President had very good reasons for not doing so, keeping his own counsel on the matter. For the individual who was directly blamed for the bloody massacre was well ensconced in the bosom of Rajapaksa, not only enjoying ministerial office under his regime but also made an office bearer of the political party he led. What is more, the very individual who was directly responsible for ordering the killing of the 400 policemen, in a supreme irony, was provided a police guard as a government minister and what is more, was waited on and even saluted by the policemen in his security detail. This, from a leader who now accuses the government for carrying out a witch-hunt against war heroes.
The government even at this late stage should do its utmost to see to the welfare of the families of these policemen. They should not be left in want and their every need should be attended to. The fate that befell them would not have occurred had they not obeyed orders to surrender and fought the terrorists. Hence the state has a moral obligation to look after the interests of the families of these policemen. It is also not too late to launch an investigation into this episode and seek out the individual who masterminded this dastardly crime, for the man with these policemens blood on his hands is still at large and is seen even addressing political rallies of the Joint Opposition.
Be that as it may, the role played by the police in the war against terrorism has largely gone unhonoured and unrecognized, with the credit for the war victory exclusively going to the tri-forces which had been hogging the limelight right throughout. True, the battle proper was fought by the security forces but it is undeniable that the police played a vital ancillary role that facilitated the whole exercise and in the process losing its men too to terror attacks. While the war was raging, the police, it was, which maintained at least a semblance of law and order in the theatre of conflict and facilitated a skeleton civilian life. It is time therefore that the police too gets the due share of the credit in the final victory over the LTTE. The supreme sacrifice made by 400 of its men alone stands out for the significant and thankless job done by the Police in achieving the final outcome. To them go the nations salute.
John bashing
Tourism and Christian Affairs Minister John Amaratunga is no stranger to controversy and is good copy for the print media. But there are times when Amaratunga falls foul with the media as well. Last week saw one such instance when the Minister lost his cool and took some media personnel to task for repeatedly badgering him with questions on the garbage situation in his Wattala electorate. According to Amaratunga the media was not invited to a discussion he had with some of his constituent on the garbage issue and that he was within his right to act the way he did. The Minister, while later apologising for the incident nevertheless made the accusation that certain media personnel were acting to a hidden agenda which he no doubt implied to be political.
Everybody who is somebody in the media circle has jumped the bandwagon in John bashing. One can understand media persons coming to the defence of their colleagues who were subjected to rough treatment by a government Minister. But one cannot fathom how the members of the Joint Opposition can take high ground on behalf of the media. While condemning the incident Gampaha District MP and JO front liner Prasanna Ranatunga says; This is not the first time that government members have threatened journalists and media institutes. It would be relevant here to jog the MPs memory to the episode where Mervyn Silva stormed the SLRC with a band of thugs and ran amok before being manhandled by the employees or the incident where the Sirasa Studio was set ablaze. So much for protecting media institutes.

Macron heads  for crushing  Parliamentary majority
French President Emmanuel Macrons party is on course for an overwhelming parliamentary majority, after Sundays first round of voting for the National Assembly left traditional parties in disarray.
Projections showed Macron widening his centrist revolution, with his Republique en Marche (Republic on the Move, REM) party and its ally MoDem tipped to win between 400 and 445 seats in the 577-member National Assembly in next Sundays second round.
Such a share would give Macron one of the biggest Parliamentary majorities for 60 years.
France is back, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe declared triumphantly.
But the vote was marked by record low turnout of 49 percent, possibly reflecting fatalism among Macrons opponents in the face of his seemingly unstoppable advance, experts said. Official final results released early Monday showed Macrons one-year-old REM and MoDem winning 32.32 percent in the first round, ahead of the Republicans on 21.56 percent and the FN on 13.20 percent. The Socialists and their allies secured just 9.51 percent while the radical left and communists were on 13.74 percent.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel congratulated Macron on a great success Sunday.
The French press Monday noted Macrons success but stressed the record abstention rate keeps its political significance in perspective.

Make up tips for girls who wear glasses
Eye wear is no more just a necessity. With a glamourous make-over, they have made their mark as fashion accessories. However, if you still feel that despite having beautiful eyes, your glasses make you look not-so-attractive, worry not. With just a few changes to the way you wear your make-up, you can enhance your look and discover an entirely new dimension to yourself.
1) Have well groomed eyebrows
Keep in mind to have trimmed and well groomed eyebrows all the time since overgrown or messy brows spoil the look. Thinner brows with an arch look best with thinner frames, whereas thicker or darker frames look best with thicker brows with an arch. If you have any prominent gap in between your brows then just fill them up with a fine eye brow pencil, in a colour that matches your brows.
2) Use matte foundation and blush
If you have an oily skin, you are probably used to the glass rims sliding down your nose with a layer of foundation sticking to it. To avoid this, use a matte foundation. The second best choice would be a water-resistant foundation. Apply a light dusting powder over the foundation. It will prevent your glasses from slipping and messing up your base make-up. Even for the blush, use a matte natural colour and avoid too much shimmer.
3) Enhance your eye make-up
Since glasses are directly related to your eyes, you have to pay more attention to the eye make-up. Firstly, try different colours  both subtle and bold  to check out what looks best on your eyes and suits your frames. Once you zero in on the shades, remember the combo so that you don't end up having eyes that look dull with your frame. Also remember, a smooth base for your eye shadow is important to keep the eye make-up in place. Try using a good eye make-up primer or use a hint of matte finish foundation, followed by a touch of translucent powder.
4) Use a thinner eyeliner
An eyeliner will make your eyes more noticeable, but use them smartly. If you wear thick, dark frames, then draw a slightly thicker eyeline, but if it is a frameless glass or have thin frames, go for a thinner liner. Take some time and use a two-step process  apply a thinner liquid eyeliner on the upper lids and follow it up with a nude shade liner to the lower waterline. It will make your eyes stand out.
5) Avoid Clumpy Mascara
Using a mascara definitely makes your eyes look bigger. Use it as you would do normally, but be sure to remove any clump by using a mascara brush whenever needed. However, avoid too much mascara on the lower lids since they can cast further shadows under your eyes. Keep it light or skip the lower lashes and focus only on upper lashes.
6) Opt for subtle lips
We all know of the unwritten rule  the focus should either be on the eyes, or the lips, and never on both. So if your eyes are quite prominent because of your glasses, then choose natural hues for your lips. However, it's a good idea to try out different options until you find a perfect balance, that suits both your skin tone and the colour of your frames.
7) When going out for a party
For a glamourous party look, make sure not to go OTT. Keep the basic points in mind. You can try wearing bold eye make-up, alongside glossy lips. Add a bold eyeline and you are ready to party. Smudging the eye liner slightly for a smoky look goes well with glasses. However, if you must, use shimmer of a lighter shade. TNN

Massive scheme afoot to provide drinking water for Anuradhapura rural people
Every possible step will be taken to provide drinking water to the people in rural areas of Anuradhapura in view of the fast spreading CKDu (Chronic Kidney Disease of uncertain etiology), the Anuradhapura District Agriculture Committee (DAC) said.
The DAC head and Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said the JICA funded Maha Kanadarawa water supply scheme is now under construction as a major step in this regard.
The kidney disease are spreading in 22 divisional secretariat divisions, healthcare surveys show. Many patients were reported from the Kebithigollewa, Rambewa, Medawachchiya, Mihintale and Padaviya divisions. The Mahakanadarawa tank based Anuradhapura north water supply project is built at a cost of Rs. 14,896 million with the financial assistance of Japan International Corporation agency, Wanninayake said.
Drinking water will be provided to 100,000 families in the Rambewa, Medawachchiya and Mihintale divisions in 75 Grama Niladhari divisions from the Mahakanadarawa water supply project. Project Director Engineer DB Gunadasa said the construction work of the project will be completed by November 2018.
The second phase of the Anuradhapura north water supply programme will see the construction of a massive water supply scheme using the water of the Wahalkada reservoir, he said.

Mastercard supports  flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka
Mastercard partners with United Nations World Food Programme
Lending its support to the innumerable Sri Lankans affected by torrential rains, Mastercard announced that it has partnered with the United Nations World Food Programme's (WFP) flood relief efforts in Sri Lanka.
Silvio Barzi, Independent Director, Mastercard Inc., handed over a donation from the company to WFP Deputy Country Director, Nguyen Duc Hoang recently.
The WFP is supporting the flood relief efforts with the Government of Sri Lanka by initially providing 22.5 million tonnes (mt) of dhal to supplement the hot-meals of the 75,000 affected population, with the support of Mastercard funding.
While we are pained by the scale of devastation by the floods around the island, we are truly inspired by the resilience and unity of Sri Lankans who have come together in support of one another, said Silvio Barzi.
As a company that has been a part of this community for around 30 years, we are committed to providing support and assistance to its people during this difficult time. As a first step, we have contributed funds to the World Food Programme's ongoing relief efforts and will continue to do what we can to help the country recover from this natural calamity.
Mastercard and WFP have been working together for over five years towards a single mission: to end hunger. Believing that technology has the power to unlock innovation in food assistance delivery, the partnership has worked to bring new ideas to WFP programs and raise important funds.
In addition to leveraging its technology, Mastercard has enabled employees around the world to undertake temporary assignments at WFP offices in order to take a hands-on approach to the partnership.
In one example, a cost-benefit analysis of the School Meals Programme conducted by WFP in Sri Lanka with the support of Mastercard found that each dollar invested to feed a schoolchild produces a return on investment of US$8.32 throughout the child's life.
Furthermore, with the creation of a donation platform that integrates charitable giving into everyday life, Mastercard and its bank and retail partners have helped raise funds to provide over 17 million school meals to vulnerable children around the world.

Matara  Kataragama Railway Extension: CMC will not compromise on quality: Project GM Tang Ming
The China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation, better known as CMC is a Chinese government entity and will not compromise on quality, safety or stake its reputation for any reason, said CMCs Project General Manager for the Matara  Kataragama Railway Extension Project (Phase I) Tang Ming.
He was responding to allegations made by former team leader appointed by the project consultants Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB) at a press conference which was aired over electronic media a few days ago.
We are deeply concerned about the allegations, he added.
The Transport Ministry awarded the designing and construction of phase one of the Matara  Kataragama Railway Extension to China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation while appointing the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau as consultants. Phase one which is the 27km stretch from Matara to Beliatta will cost the Sri Lanka government USD 278 million and is financed by Chinas Exim Bank.
CMC with a staff of over 2000 stationed worldwide is experienced in the construction and upgrading of railway lines and has successfully completed the construction of the 158km Ankara - Istanbul high-speed railway project in Turkey which commenced in 2006 at a cost of USD 1.27 billion, before engaging in the construction of phase one of the Matara - Kataragama Railway Extension Project in 2010, Tang Ming said.
CMC has also been awarded the locomotive and carriage and construction plants, and component assembly project in Myanmar in 2013 at a cost of USD 102 million and in 2015 was awarded the high-speed upgrading of the 926 km Teheran  Mashhad railway project costing USD 1.69 billion. All the above projects are on a design and build basis and are financed by China Exim Bank. In addition, the company has supplied many Diesel locomotives and passenger carriages to Pakistan, Iran, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Turkmenistan, Brazil, Cuba and even Sri Lanka, said CMCs Project Manager in Sri Lanka Wu Fan Yu.
We have cast over 300 concrete girders for the Southern Railway Extension Project of which only less than 1 percent failed certification.
These girders have been discarded and the rest have been launched under the supervision of the CECB and Ministry of Transport. It is the CECB that has been appointed by the Ministry of Transport to approve and monitor the design and construction of Phase one of the Matara  Kataragama Railway Extension and engineers from CECB are expected to approve contract material submissions, contract methods and monitor every step of the construction process. It is only once they certify that we can proceed with the construction or move on to the next step, explained Tang. It is true that the project is behind schedule. There are many reasons for the delay including adverse weather conditions including delays caused by CECB, he added.

May unveils Britains new Cabinet
UK: Britains embattled Prime Minister Theresa May on Sunday unveiled her full Cabinet, making few changes as the premier clings to power after losing her Parliamentary majority in a snap election.
May made Damian Green, former work and pensions secretary, her deputy by naming him first Secretary of State. Treasury Chief Secretary David Gauke moves in to take Greens place, while the leader of the House of Commons, David Lidington, becomes justice secretary.
Lidingtons move sees him replace Liz Truss, who has faced criticism in the justice role and has been moved by May to Gaukes former post as treasury chief secretary.
A surprise appointment came with the naming of Michael Gove as environment and agriculture minister, less than a year after he was sacked from the cabinet by May.
I genuinely didnt expect this role, he told Sky News.
The minor reshuffle has been seen as a reflection of Mays weak position after she called a snap election, only to lose seats in Thursdays vote in a dramatic change of fortunes.
In announcing the remainder of her Cabinet on Sunday, May kept Jeremy Hunt on as health secretary despite him being vilified for his handling of the treasured National Health Service.
Liam Fox stays on as international trade secretary, a post created in the wake of Britains decision last year to leave the European Union as the country searches for new partners outside of the bloc.
Downing Street announced on Friday that there would be no reshuffle among the governments top ministers, including Finance Minister Philip Hammond despite reports ahead of the election that he may be sacked. Boris Johnson stays on as Foreign Minister, alongside fellow eurosceptic David Davis as Brexit minister.
Mays replacement last year as Interior Minister, Amber Rudd, keeps her post, as does Defence Minister Michael Fallon.- AFP

A memorial evergreen
Despite that the civil conflict ended over eight years ago, there are somewhat few memorials to those killed in the war who were not part of the armed forces or police. Beyond that, there remain thousands of missing persons who lack graves or monuments of commemoration.
Chairman of the Center for Humanitarian Affairs Jeevan Thiagarajah hopes to ameliorate both of these situations through the planting of a massive forest in the Poonakary Division in the Kilinochchi District that will commemorate the dead, missing, and missing in action on both sides of the conflict.
Thiagarajah, who has decades of experience working on issues related to good governance, security, and human rights, was deeply affected by the horrors people suffered during the war. His boss was blown up in the late 1990s, and he was appalled at the violence of the war in general, and not least of the southern insurgency.
But what bothered him most were the cases of the missing and of children who were conscripted.
During the war, he would go to the UN Human Rights Council, and on one of his visits, he received information on 11,000-12,000 complaints from families of missing persons.
As I remember, not more than two of these families had received a response as to what had happened to their missing relations, he said.
Furthermore, just after the war ended, Thiagarajah attended a conference in the United States where a man told the harrowing story of a woman grieving over a gravestone.
This man said that the woman was crying over the gravestone of her daughter, who was officially a combatant who had perished.
All of these conscripted kids started as schoolchildren. They lost their childhood and their schooling life. If they happened to survive, they are known as former combatants, not as former schoolchildren. That narrative about children who had perished unsung, unknown, and unmarked, is what I want to bring awareness to. If you can find a grave, which is unlikely, it is usually unmarked, he said.
A forest memorial
Though he has been thinking about these issues ever since the end of the conflict, it was only in the past few weeks that Thiagarajah settled on planting a forest as a memorial to the dead and missing.
He owns 40 acres of land in the Kilinochchi district, and he intends to plant up to 100,000 trees on the plot that will act as memorials to individuals. He plans to allocate 50,000 slots to members of the armed forces and Police and the other 50,000 to anyone who was not in the government forces, but was killed or is missing.
It is unclear whether 40 acres would be enough space to harbour 100,000 trees, but Thiagarajah said that he would have access to at least another 40 acres that are owned by a family member.
To plan and develop the forest, Thiagarajah has enlisted the help of internationally-renowned analog forestry expert Ranil Senanayake. Analog forestry does not rely on chemicals and aims to foster ecological functions that would allow a natural forest to grow. Senanayake will decide which species of trees to plant and how and where to plant them.
While he owns the land, he is well-aware that such a massive and ambitious project requires outside help. Over the past two weeks, he has written to Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Karunasena Hettiarachchi and to Chairperson of the Office of National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga to guage their interest in the project.
I have effectively asked the armed forces if they want the 50,000 slots. If they say yes, I would like their technical and planning support. Likewise, I have asked ONUR if they would be willing to help find 50,000 families who want to plant trees in remembrance of their relations who are dead and missing, he said.
Though he has spoken to Hettiarachchi, he has yet to receive an official response from either the Ministry of Defence or the ONUR.
It is his aim to have members of the public buy a tree in the name of a dead or missing relative. Thiagarajah wants the trees to be impersonal in that there will be no names or other special markings or symbols on the trees. The only means of identification will be a number for both the slot and the tree.
He also wants to give people who have purchased a tree the option of receiving a second tree that they would be able plant in their garden or in their town. This way, they might have a memorial closer to home.
They could also treat that tree as a kind of fixed deposit that, for a very modest startup cost, would become very valuable down the road, he said.
Though the plans for the forest are not yet finalized, Thiagarajahhas several rules concerning the organization of the trees. Because the forest is slated to be a memorial to both soldiers from the armed forces and people were not in the armed forces, it will not be cut into special sections based on ethnicity, religion, or government affiliation. Instead, a computer will determine the plot people receive.
Yet another aspect of the plan is the inclusion of a floored, roofed, and open-walled structure within the forest that would serve as a place of worship for any religious service at any time of day.
In this respect, Thiagarajah was inspired by Beiruts Garden of Forgiveness, a symbol of national unity, which lies in the city center and is surrounded by various places of worship for multiple religions.
He hopes to make the forest meaningful and accessible to everyone. Therefore, people of any religion would be able to worship amidst the trees that would memorialize Sri Lankans from every ethnicity and faith. Through this project, perhaps, those from the North and East and the government forces can find some common ground.
Funding, environment aspects,and challenges
Funding for the project, however, has yet to be sorted out. Thiagarajah is hopeful that people could buy a tree for Rs. 1,000, but that would not pay for the forests upkeep. Therefore, he is also looking into the possibility of offering trees as carbon credits to those who are environmentally-conscious or the corporate sector.
But perhaps the most promising and ambitious funding plan is to align this project with the forestry drive that President Maithripala Sirisena recently announced.
My goals for the forest match up well with the forest project that the President is leading. We wish to enhance forest cover and plant more trees, so it could be good for both parties to work together, Thiagarajah said, while noting that he is excited about the positive environmental impact that the project would bring about.
Im a recent convert to environmentalism. I work very hard to improve the environment. Im looking at the issues of water security, deforestation, floods, and climate change. Thats weighing heavily on me and influencing me, he said.
There are still significant obstacles that must be overcome if the project is to succeed, however.
First off, it is expensive to keep up and irrigate a new forest: In the first 20 years or so I would need to be able to provide drip irrigation. So I would need to find and use some water to get things going, but after I will the forest would be self-sustaining, he said.
Ranil Senanayake, for his part, noted the following challenges:  The soils and water flow in the northern areas differ from most of the country, as they lie on a limestone bed. This feature brings great potential as well as danger as all the surface water drains into the vesicular formation below.
He also remarked on the high concentrations of agro-toxins and artificial fertilizers in the area as potential challenges to be overcome. But outside of the potential problems the planting of the forest would present, Thiagarajah said that it would be very difficult to alert 50,000 families of the dead or missing to the project and to convince them to buy plots.
Getting the message out to the unknown, the unsung woman or man or child; thats the challenge. Another issue is getting messages to remote places and convincing people its worth it to buy trees. And that has to be done very carefully, because it might stir up memories which would cause trouble and damage, he said.
Furthermore, these people would have to be able to prove that their relatives are dead or missing, and that could be difficult in and of itself.
There is no doubt that this project offers a new method of integrative memorialization that also stays away from erecting massive structures that, for better or worse, glorify war and, by extension, suffering. It remains to be seen, however, if and when the project is implemented.

No show by Ven. Gnanasara Thera
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera was not present in Court yesterday regarding a Contempt of Court action filed against him over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court and the Court was informed that Gnanasara thera was not appearing since he has death threats.
The Court of Appeal observed that Court will have to issue a warrant against the accused if he failed to appear in Court on next inquiry date.
Presidents Counsel Tirantha Walaliyadda with Counsel Sasika Mithunaarachchi appearing on behalf of Gnanasara thera told Court that their client was not appearing in Courts since he has received death threats.
However, on a previous occasion, counsel who appeared on behalf of Gnanasara thera tendered a medical certificate to Court informing that Gnanasara thera was being treated at a hospital for an illness.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appearing for the Attorney General moved Court to issue a warrant for the arrest of accused for not appearing in Court on several occasions citing various reasons.
The Court of Appeal Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Devika Tennakoon observed that they would not issue a warrant against the accused but Court wanted the accused to be present in Court on July 18, 19 and 20.
On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire into such a complaint.
On a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the constitution.
Earlier a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on the charges of Contempt of Court, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this Contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges leveled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

The actress underwent special Hindi class to learn her dialogues. She worked hard at her diction but since she only had very few days to learn, at times she would take longer to get the language right and director Kabir Khan is known to be a perfectionist.
Its then that Salman turned to Zhu Zhus rescue. He would go over her lines before her scenes, explaining the meaning of her lines. He even came up with easy ways to help her remember these lines.

Sarfraz the hero  as Pakistan squeeze into  Champions Trophy semis
Cardiff: Sarfraz Ahmed produced a superb captains innings following a top-order collapse to see Pakistan into the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy with a three-wicket win over Sri Lanka at Cardiff on Monday.
Pakistan, chasing a seemingly modest 237 to win, slumped to 162 for seven.
But Sarfrazs 61 not out and Mohammad Amirs 28 not out saw Pakistan home with 31 balls to spare after they shared an unbroken eighth-wicket partnership of 75.
Man-of-the-match Sarfraz, crucially dropped twice, ended the contest when he uppercut Lasith Malinga for four.
It was his fifth boundary in 79 balls and led the joyous wicket-keeper to run a semi-circle round the ground.
Pakistan will return to Sophia Gardens for a last-four clash with tournament hosts England in Cardiff on Wednesday.
Earlier, Pakistan induced a middle-order collapse as Sri Lanka slumped to 236 all out.
Both Pakistan and Sri Lanka had to win on Monday to join already qualified title-holders India from Group B in the knockout stages of a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international sides.
India will play Bangladesh in Thursdays second semi-final at Edgbaston, with the final at the Oval on Sunday.
In what was a must-win match for both sides, Sri Lanka were dismissed for 236 -- well below the modern-day ODI par total of 300.
And it seemed like it wasnt going to be their day when Pakistan opener Azhar Ali was dropped on nought by Asela Gunaratne at point.
But fellow opener Fakhar Zaman was far more dynamic, hitting three fours in as many balls off the unorthodox Malinga.
In just his second match at this level, the left-handed Fakhar completed a 34-ball fifty. But, two balls later, he fell for exactly 50 when a top-edged hook off Nuwan Pradeep was caught by Gunaratne at fine leg. Pakistan, then 92 for one, saw three wickets go down in a hurry.
Babar Azam and Mohammad Hafeez both fell to tame legside catches before Azhars painstaking 34 ended when he fended at paceman Suranga Lakmal and Kusal Mendis held an awkward catch at a wide slip position.
Shoaib Malik (11) then feathered a catch behind following an attempted pull off Malinga. Fahim Ashraf thrillingly hooked Malinga over long leg for six but the ODI debutant was run out for a run-a-ball 15 when bowler Thisara Perera deflected a Sarfraz drive onto the stumps at the non-strikers end.
Sarfraz was now the key man but Sri Lanka dropped him on 38, when with Pakistan 194 for seven, Thisara Perera at mid-on floored the simplest of catches.
And he was missed again, on 40, when substitute Seekkuge Prasanna dropped a far more difficult chance running in from deep square leg.
In the end, Sri Lanka were made to pay for a poor batting display.
Sent in by Sarfraz, they were making steady progress at 161 for three while top-scorers Dickwella (73) and captain Angelo Mathews (39) were together at the crease.
But the loss of Mathews sparked a middle-order collapse that saw four wickets lost for just six runs as Sri Lanka slumped to 167 for seven.
Only same late tail-order hitting, including Suranga Lakmals ODI best 26, got Sri Lanka past 200 in an innings where Pakistan pacemen Junaid Khan (three for 40) and Hasan Ali (three for 43) did the bulk of the damage.
All-rounder Mathews, fresh from an unbeaten fifty in Sri Lankas shock seven-wicket victory over India, drove off-spinner Mohammad Hafeez for six, while Dickwella ended a sequence of 54 balls without a boundary by cover-driving left-arm spinner Imad Wasim for four.
Mathews, however, fell when an inside edge off Mohammad Amir gave the elated left-arm paceman his first wicket of the tournament.
In what turned out to be a brilliant all-round match for wicket-keeper Sarfraz, he held a superb low one-handed catch to dismiss Dickwella after the batsman got an inside edge to Amir. AFP

A sorry ending to a happy reunion: Brothers united after three years die on rail track

Two brothers, Shashi Madhushan (24) and Thikshana Shakshan (12) met with a tragic ending last evening when they were hit by a train while taking selfies on the rail track between Bambalapitiya and Kollupitiya.
The brothers, residents of Anuradhapura, had met after a long separation when the older brother Shashi Madhushan arrived in Sri Lanka after completing his studies in Singapore the past three years.
The family had picked the older boy Shashi Madhushan from the airport and then driven to Galle Face in Colombo to celebrate the joyous occasion.
On the way to Kollupitiya, the brothers had stopped to take selfies on the coastal rail track and met with their untimely death.
Grandmother of the deceased W. Prema Gunawardene said the two brothers had been so engrossed with taking selfies they had failed to hear the train bearing down on them.
The younger brother Thikshana Shakshan was decapitated instantly, while the older brother had succumbed to his injuries en route to the Colombo National Hospital.
The head belonging to the younger brother was recovered from the Kollupitiya Police Station today.

Soundarie bares her Soul: Soul-stirring!
Soundaries Soul is a quest to win the hearts of men and women. She will sing in gods abode, far after the last waves of the ocean die upon this earth. Her music will never die and will never be forgotten. And the best is yet to come.
Soul an evening of Original Music by Soundarie was held recently at Lionel Wendt theatre. It was an evening when we were powerlessly under the spell of Soundarie David. It was a show where every item was personally crafted by Soundarie with great passion and love.
The music and Soundarie were one that evening. It was symbiotic. It could not have been any other way. The music must flow throughout the mind of the artiste and that day Soundarie was immersed in her music. It was a phenomenal performance.
Every music item was choreographed excellently. There was some sort of a force that connected the performers to us, an irresistible force that spoke to our hearts, a force that reached out to us and compelled our attention, a force that was spellbinding and mesmeric. A cocoon of music was created around us.
Right throughout the performance Soundarie had this energy that was so admirable. It was obvious that Soundarie had put in so much effort. That is why she is one of the greatest performers in Sri Lanka. She really cares about her audience and believes in them as much as she believes in her music.
Grace and talent
Always humble, she is a fine example of grace and talent. Though she is prodigiously talented and is able to create some of the greatest pieces of music, she has never let this distract her from the focal point of her music - which is to share the gift of music God has given her. As mentioned before, music is Soundaries gift and it is a light to the world.
Her music undoubtedly had meaning. It speaks individually. It offers the audience the message - that life has so much beauty in it. Indeed in a pamphlet issued at the evening Soundarie speaks:
Whilst classical music has been my training. Over the years Ive grown to appreciate and love different genres of music. My family, friends, music legends and life experiences have been influential in my development as a musician, and have to a great extent inspired me. Soul is my way of speaking the thoughts within my soul that words cannot express. They are simple melodies that anyone can relate to. To all those who have helped me with this concert, especially my sponsors and my amazing event and production team, a heartfelt thank you. To the musicians on stage and off, to my teachers, my family and friends  thank you for being my inspiration, said Soundarie.
Soundaries emotional moment
The evening featured some scintillating performances not only by Soundarie but the artistes who performed alongside of her. Jerome De Silva delivered a rendition of Hamlet. De Silvas deep voice and the melody played by Soundarie held the attention of the crowd.
Soundaries very own girls Soul Sounds made it a night to remember. They did their teacher proud as they charmed everyone with their music. Certainly it must have been an emotional moment for Soundarie seeing these girls remaining true to her that evening. Former Stigmata member Andrew Obeysekera and Dushy Perera, both who have made a name for themselves in the music industry, performed alongside to Soundarie, making the performance one of power and a performance of the highest standard. The lighting and the special effects and the brilliance of her companions added to the radiance of the performance.
Bathiya Jayakody a childhood friend of Soundaries did not disappoint as he crooned the evening away doing a little dance as well. Shehara Liyanage delivered a performances that may indeed have raised goosebumps. Her voice certainly was magnetic.
It was a performance that showed us there was something bigger than ourselves out there. Truly music is universal and unites people. Because that day the crowd was united in wonderment.
There was a real appreciation of the music.
But more than anything music healed all of us. Soundaries music has the potential to heal. That day it really entered our minds and it was like a balm applied. The music was personally crafted by Soundarie, who I am sure is not unaware of the heights her music can lift people up to.
The compering too blended nicely with the evening with the witty Danu nicely introducing his witticisms at appropriate points.
And all throughout the performance there was Soundarie seated at her piano, the center of the performance. Despite the fine performances one could not help but look at her as she seemed to direct the flow of energy.
----------------
Soundarie in brief
Soundarie is a qualified lawyer with a masters-in-law, in the field of intellectual property and entertainment law from the University of California Berkeley. She was the Deputy Director at the SAARC Cultural Center based in Sri Lanka for the last six years and is currently the Director, programs for the Colombo Cultural Hub. Her awards include the SAARC Woman of Achievement Award, the Zonta Award and the Bunka Award.

Terrors beyond imagination
The Mummy is a 2017 American 3D action-adventure horror film directed by Alex Kurtzman and written by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie and Dylan Kussman, with a story by Kurtzman, Jon Spaihts and Jenny Lumet.
It is a reboot of The Mummy franchise and the first installment in the Dark Universe film series. The film stars Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, Annabelle Wallis, Jake Johnson, Courtney B. Vance, Marwan Kenzari and Russell Crowe.
There were two sequels, 2001s The Mummy Returns, and 2008s The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.
Though safely entombed in a crypt deep beneath the unforgiving desert, an ancient queen (Sofia Boutella of Kingsman: The Secret Service and Star Trek Beyond) whose destiny was unjustly taken from her, is awakened in our current day, bringing with her malevolence grown over millennia and terrors that defy human comprehension. From the sweeping sands of the Middle East through hidden labyrinths under modern-day London, The Mummy brings a surprising intensity and balance of wonder and thrills in an imaginative new take that ushers in a new world of gods and monsters.
Nick Morton is a soldier of fortune who plunders ancient sites for timeless artifacts and sells them to the highest bidder. Morton must now stop the resurrected monster as she embarks on a furious rampage through the streets of London. Russel Crowe plays a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde  like character.
The Mummy is screening at Majestic Cineplex at 10.15 am, 1.15 pm, 4.15 pm and 7.15 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.15 pm and Empire Cineplex at 1.30 pm, 4.30 pm, 7.30 pm and Fri/Sat at 10.30 pm and Sat/Sun at 10.30 am.

Thirteen citizens to receive  National Civilian Bravery awards
The 23rd National Civilian Bravery Awards to recognise those who saved the lives of others at the risk of their own will be held on June 15.
The event scheduled to be held at 3.30 pm at the Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre will have 13 ordinary citizens recognised for their acts of bravery between January 1 2016, and December 31, 2016. Three of these candidates are to be recognised in two special categories of The Civilian Bravery Philanthropy Award and the Civilian Bravery Flora/Fauna Award.
Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya will be the Chief Guest at the event. In the last 23 years, 300 people have been awarded National Civilian Bravery awards, DIG Legal, Discipline and Conduct Range Ajith Rohana said.
The DIG was addressing a media briefing at the Government Information Department yesterday.
The awards help encourage ordinary citizens to step up in a time of need, especially during emergency situations where passers-by can do more to recue people, before official rescue teams reach the emergency destination, he added.
The awards were a brainchild of the Foundation for Civilian Bravery, a non-profit organisation established by Act No. 4 of 2009 to honour civilians who voluntarily risk their lives saving or attempting to save the lives of others.
We want to introduce the concept of heroism to society and to have people discuss what that should mean. At times people engage in nefarious activities having thought that, that would make them a hero. Therefore, it is important that we understand what constitutes heroism, Founder/President of the Foundation for Civilian Bravery Kasun Chandraratne said.
Since 2016, Janashakthi Insurance PLC has been sponsoring the event and this year, Janashakthi Director/CEO Jude Fernando said they received a record number of applications for the awards and hoped to conduct this years ceremony in a grander manner than last year.

Treasury Bond issue: Auditor General stands  by his statement
Government incurs losses
Auditor General (AG) H.M. Gamini Wijesinghe said he stands by his statement that a loss has been incurred by the government due to the Treasury Bond issuance on February 27, 2015.
The Auditor General was testifying before the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond Issue yesterday.
Additional Solicitor General Yasanta Kodagoda led the evidence.
Kodagoda questioned AG Wijesinghe on the special audit report regarding the Treasury Bonds issued by the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank from February 2015 to May 2016. The audit report was submitted on June 29, 2016. The commission questioned AG Wijesinghe whether he would define the outcome of the Treasury Bond auction as a loss or a disadvantage.
The questioning was based on the differences in Sinhala terms used in the COPE report and the Auditor Generals report regarding the outcome.
The COPE report used the Sinhala word awasiya which means a disadvantage, whereas the AGs report mentioned it to be an alabhaya meaning a loss.
AG Wijesinghe said the transaction has incurred a loss and not a disadvantage.
The term disadvantage came into use later, used by the COPE committee, he said.
The Auditor General said the immediate loss incurred by the transaction is Rs. 400 million. The gap of Rs. 0.4 billion can be calculated examining the difference between the face value of the Treasury Bonds which is Rs. 10.058 billion and the amount received from the auction which is Rs. 9.658 billion. The discount given to these bonds is the reason behind the calculated gap, AG Wijesinghe said.
He said the value of accepted bids taken as a percentage of the value of bids offered, it would be a 905 percent.
In comparison with the acceptance of bids from 2008 to 2014, the highest percentage would be a 407 percent at the auction held on May 8, 2012.
Asked as to what would have been the best option that the Central Bank could have taken to fulfill the governments debt requirement on February 27, 2015, AG Wijesinghe said the Public Debt Department should have taken Rs. 2.6 billion through the auction method and raised the rest via the direct placement method from the captive sources such as the EPF, ETF, Insurance Cooperation and the Bank of Ceylon.
Asked as to who decided on a 12.5 coupon rate fixed on the Treasury Bonds issued on February 27, 2015, AG Wijesinghe said he did not receive a proper explanation as to who fixed the rate.
He said it seems that the officers of the Public Debt Department have decided on the coupon rate as they prefer.
AG Wijesinghe was asked by the commission as to why he did not attach the second option sheet provided by the Public Debt Department to the Tender Board on February 27, 2015. There have been two option sheets, the first one which includes the proposition of the Public Debt Department and the second one, including the actual decision to accept Rs. 10.5 billion at the auction.
AG Wijesinghe said he would look into the matter and inform the commission by the next day.

The Auditor General is to appear before the commission today as well.

We are currently witnessing the Year of Giving 2017 initiative declared by UAE President Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, which further instills the value of giving and the importance of lending a helping hand to the disadvantaged people across the world.
Receiving the cheque, Ambassador S.J. Mohideen thanked the Lulu Group for its gesture.

The world community has responded by supporting the people of Sri Lanka with an open heart and this noble gesture by the Lulu Group is much appreciated and accepted with gratitude by the people of Sri Lanka, said S.J. Mohideen.

Unique way to tackle violence..!
And as the world tackles violence with age old conventional methods written by generals and other famous leaders in history books, a Chief Minister of the ruling BJP party, the party of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has come out with even a more unique way of tackling violence: The Chief Minister after going through sleepless days and nights, seeing his state violently targeted by striking farmers who dont want to pay back loans, and seeing the escalating situation, concluded enough was enough, and decided to go on an indefinite fast!
I can imagine officers and government officials, frantic with concern, now calm and peaceful as they realize the state of affairs in the state is under control.
With same quietness and stillness they answer frenzied queries from police officers and military, Sir, the farmers are burning buses and cars, should we use firearms against them
No reason to! The chief minister has the situation under control! smile the officials, as they go about their normal day.
And suddenly the world sits up and takes notice of this new technique used by one of the larger states in India:
A jailor in Mexico who finds his prisoners are on a prison break, refuses to eat, I will not eat till those jailbirds return to their cells! he says with deadly resolve, even as the escapees jump over the wall and run away.
In England, Theresa May looks forlornly at the poll results, realizing she has lost 16 seats, Im going to go on a fast! she tells the nation on BBC. I want those sixteen seats back. I want a majority in Parliament again, and will fast till I get my way!
Are you going to give up all food, till then asks the concerned TV anchor.
Well maybe not all food, but certainly ice cream, especially the vanilla kind, I detest! says a resolute Theresa May as the nation shudders and the opposition wonder whether they should return the seats theyve just won.
And in the US, Trump glances at Fox News and likes the new method, I will get back my falling ratings! he grunts, I will get people to like my friend Putin!
And how dear, will you do that asks the First Lady.
I will give up reading! said the president, No books or novels!
But you always found those books difficult husband, especially long sentences and big words!
Yeah! says the president, But let the people decide, either no reading or accept Putin!
And in India, the Chief Ministers aide looks gleefully at his junior as farmers throw stones outside, Our boss is looking slim and fit!
Maybe I should also go on fast, says his junior looking at his spreading waistline, It does seem to be a unique method..!

When Sri Lanka thrashed Bangladesh in WC 2015
Rewinding our readers minds, to the above match which the ardent fans might remember.
Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat, Dinesh Chandimal got the nod to replace injured Jeevan Mendis. The game was played at the MCG where Sri Lankans are bound to throng there to watch the proceedings and once they enter the arena, they will watch with abated breath.
T.M. Dilshan and L. Thirimanne opened, Sri Lankas batting line up which ran deep with Chandimal anchoring the no. 7 slot. Thirimanne was dropped in the first over by Inamul Haque off Mortaza, I for 0 after one over. Hussein bowls a wide to Thirimanne from the other end and follows up with another, and Thirimanne got the first four of the match, a mistimed drive through the covers. It was 11 for 0 after 3 overs. He still found it difficult to find the sweet spot of the bat although scoring in a disjointed fashion, after 6 overs it was 25 with a solitary boundary thus far. At this stage Dilshan was 4 off 7 balls Thirimanne was more in the scenario than Dilshan. It was 28 for 0 after 7 overs. Taskin replaced Hussein and Dilshan thwacks him past cover for 4 and summarily dispatches him to square leg for another and nonchalantly hooks him for yet another, 40 for 0 after 8 overs. Mortaza was bowling on a tight line and tempts Thirimanne to go aerial past mid off for 3 and then snicks him past slips for three, Mortaza was livid and the score stood at 46 for 0 off 9. Shakib al Hassan was introduced to the attack and Dilshan edged him past slip for 3 runs. 51 for 3 after 10 overs and Sri Lanka were comfortably placed, Thirimanne a laborious 29 off 42 balls and Dilshan the more enterprising was 18 off 22 balls. Dilshan pulled Mortaza through mid-wicket for four, due to his open stance and exaggerated bottom hand play his offside shots looked crablike but not so his leg side fluent play. Mahamadullah, the off spinner was introduced to the attack at 60 off 12. Shakib bowls a tight maiden over to Dilshan, and the following over gets a 4 past cover, using his footwork to good effect, 80 for 0 after 17 and 83 for 0 after 18, Bangladesh doing a containing job, after a long drought of fours Dilshan breaks the stale mate and cuts loose; and pulls Mahamadullah for four and straight drives Taskin for another four, and followed by two more, a flurry of fours got him to his fifty, our score stood at 103 for 0 in 21 overs. Thirimanne lifted Sabir over the bowlers head for four and got to his 50 off 74 balls, a dogged innings indeed, immediately he gets out trying to paddle sweep and gave a catch to Taskin at deep third man off Rubel.
Kumar Sangakkara walked out to a tremendous roar from the crowd, it was his 400th game, 25 overs had gone 122 for 1, and a solid platform was built for a big score. Immediately Sanga showed Thirimanne how to play the paddle sweep over the slips and got a clean four. It was 133 for 1 at a run rate of 5, fours kept rolling on and it was 160 for 1 off 32. Sangakkara artistacaly opened the face of the bat to avoid the cover fielder and got a four off Taskin the exasperated bowler. A caught and bowled chance was dropped off Sanga and the crowd breathed a sigh of relief, he then drove Shakib al Hassan past extra cover for four and the 50 partnership came in 52 balls, runs coming at a fair gallop. Sanga is on song now cover driving Mortaza for four and brought up the 200, he got to his fifty sweeping Shakib for four, 52 off 46 balls, after 40 overs, 217 for 1, Dilshan got to his hundred in 116 balls bringing up the hundred partnership as well. The trade mark Dilscoop was also on display and another boundary. It was batting at its best by the two Sri Lankan maestros, Dilshans unorthodoxy vs Sangakkaras improvisation, our guys were really proud to be Sri Lankans. And the banners and the flags were a blaze. Sri Lanka wraps up at 332 in 50 overs.
Bangladesh went gamely for the target but fell short by 92 runs, Dilshan shone with the ball together with Lasith Malinga to bring home the bacon. Dilshan was the Man of the Match.
SRI LANKA OUTCLASS INDIA
Looking into the current scene Sri Lanka outclassed, out thought and bamboozled India. Although hampered with injuries and penalties, they came with all their guns blazing on the day and it was batting at its calculated best. It was Kusal Mendis the little daredevil from Moratuwa who peppered the mid wicket boundary with his extraordinary hand to eye coordination and the more orthodox Danushka Gunathilake who with his high elbow technique and power packed strokes down the ground and over it that broke the back of the cock a hoop Indian bowlers. The Indian bowlers faces for the first time in this tournament looked like dead corpses. Both were unfortunately run outwhen well set, then it was the muscle bound Kusal Perera and somewhat stiff Angelo Mathews show, the former found his timing wanting but the latter took command from the word go with his little dinks on either side of the wicket and the angry looking Virat Kohli was at a loss trying to stop the run drip. Gradually Kusal found his rhythm and was muscling the ball to all corners of the park and next to no time the target was within reach of the Lankans when cramps got the better of him. Kusal of course was running like a hare in comparison to Mathews dawdling, which could be excused for his injury prone limbs. Mathews was the master of the match situation at all times and till the end. In the end the great improviser Asela Gunaratne was the catalyst to hasten the victory for the Sri Lankans. A Sri Lankan fan said, it was high speed hitting. It was the mother of all upsets on the Champions Trophy thus far.

Where the world ends
The elephant he was in pursuit of, after being severely wounded and driven back into the forest, reappeared close to Major Haddock, who fired and immediately moved to one side; his servant, who had stood behind him, then fired; and the animal turned off towards Major Haddock, whom he seized, threw down, and trampled to death. This was the work of a moment; for the servant flew to the spot, and, while he was raising the mangled remains of his gallant master, the elephant walked slowly off. Sir Robert Wilmot Horton, Governor of Ceylon, has erected a stone pillar, with an inscription, to mark the precise spot where this melancholy catastrophe occurred.
Jonathan Forbes makes such a reference to Sir Robert Wilmot Horton in his work, Eleven Years in Ceylon. Sir Robert does not sound much familiar to contemporary Sri Lankans, most of who have already been to the national park named after him: Horton Plains.
If you are in Colombo, sketching plans to reach this destination, be mindful of one thing: it is the destination that is cool, more than the journey. Whether it is private or public transport, the journey is going to be a long, arduous, one unless you opt for a helicopter. Travelling by train will be cost-effective, but remember to book the seats in advance. Neglect such a small thing and be ready to travel for eight hours from Colombo Fort to Ohiya.
Sunrise over the plains is a burgundy spectacle. The almost snowy peaks of the early morning hold the colour of the sky. The grass is wet and tangles the grass in verdant greenery. Horton Plains is blessed with other attractions such as Worlds End and Bakers Fall. The birdsong is inconstant, but the wildlife presence is very much felt.
Located at an altitude of 6000 feet above sea level, you need to be prepared for a great climb in order to reach the Worlds End. En route, you will hear stories about young couples who have committed suicide on the Worlds End. The more depressing thing, however, is the sight of garbage sprinkled across the plains. You have two choices on such an occasion: either lash out the fellow Sri Lankans or volunteer to gather the dirt into a bag to freshen the picturesque plains.
Whatever the choice you may pick, it is going to be about nine kilometres if you really plan to reach the Worlds End. And that means a walk of six hours  or so, depending on your pace. That walk with the cool breeze wafting across is not that strenuous like walking in the Colombo heat. You will still feel exhausted, but all that tiredness will dissolve into one of accomplishment as you finally reach the peak. Draw a breath, steel yourself and fix your gaze downwards.
And take a while to explore the souls of those of us, the humans, who had the courage to take that lethal leap.
Horton Plains is home to two els: leopard and sambar. You might have a chance to pay a call upon either of them, despite sighting a leopard is a rare prospect. Your chance of encountering a leopard is high if you choose to spend the night at the Plains. Leopard and Sambar have an interconnection. The Sambar is constantly on a vigil about the leopards, and the latter takes about 10 days to finish off a carcass of the former. That leaves much room for us humans to dread. Rather oddly, however, their taste buds are more tailored for sambar flesh than that of humans. A sambar squints at you for a moment and will look forward to a bribe of a grub.
If you have plans to spend a day or two, be armed with winter clothes. At night the temperature tends to go down to the minus. However wintry it may feel, try a bath in the freezing water and you will get accustomed to the cold weather.
Before Sir Robert Horton stumbled upon here, the plains were known as Maha Thenna (Great Open Plains), because of the meadow extraordinaire. During the times of the British, the area was not much developed. Only the horse-riders could access the jungle. The travellers mostly belonged to the colonial elite who were in pursuit of game.
There is so much to watch out for in Horton Plains thanks to its rich flora and fauna. And that is exactly why you should take extra care of your clothing, footwear in particular. Put on proper footwear; because you have several hours to walk, for one, and on the other hand you might be greeted by unwelcome earthly creatures ready to feast on your skin.

The apex of evolution in photographic technology is capturing the right moment. It is an act of camera technology, photographers observation and his reflexes known as motor skills. Capability to capture the right moment shows the cameramans prowess whether he is old-school or represents digital era, says veteran and renowned photographer, writer, poet and a teacher of photography, Lal Hegoda.
Hegodas latest photography exhibition, Solosak Roo (Sixteen Photographs) will be unveiled at the Lionel Wendt Art Centre on June 22. The event will be opened for the public from 23 to 25 from 10 am to 7pm.
How can I abort the fetuses originate after all 16 photographs had been taken So I give my fans a bonus by adding few more photographs to the exhibition, says Hegoda. Hence the exhibition will physically showcase 22 photographs by the veteran.
Hegoda has served 47 years as a teacher of photography. He has held photography exhibitions in Colombo, Kandy, Galle and also in the United Kingdom and Tokyo. His very first exhibition (Freuds Daughter) was held in 1971.
Lal Hegoda says there cannot be any Art without imagination. Photography too has a technique but one should not be a slave of technique, he says.
He adds; Photography could also be considered as a folk art. There is a fourth dimension in human life. The photographer can make this fourth dimension visible in human minds through his works.
Hegoda also indulges in poetry and often adds value to his innovative photographs with verses of divine touch. At the unveiling of his book Lokaya Ekama Yaayaki (The World is one common locale) few years back which had a mix of photography and poetry he said, People of the new world do not just look at photographsthey read photographs.
Hegoda sees the world through the lenses of a camera and tells us a story to take home and think, seasoned author W A Abeysinghe said at the event. Abeysinghe said the vision, imagination, philosophy and presentation will ultimately win over technique.
Hegoda has his own philosophy on photography. Photography is a massive external drive that preserves visionary memory. Photography thus is equivalent to a vast external drive that serves the entire world, he says.
The human brain stores memories as a computer encapsulates data. Memorizing means recalling old memories into the limelight of active memory, like serving data to a processor. Data stored in human brain is meant to fade off gradually. Unimportant and unused data shall be outdated and forgotten with the passage of time. However forgetting is not a complete deletion, it is merely a dwindled stage of memory. Data documented in photographs would not decay if duly preserved. A photograph can thus recall something which is already forgotten or occurred decades ago, he elaborates.
You can get to know how your mother looked like when she was young. Perhaps there should be an image showing her delightful face on her wedding day. How would have she looked when she was pregnant with you Which other medium will enable you to engage in such time travel Hegoda ponders.
