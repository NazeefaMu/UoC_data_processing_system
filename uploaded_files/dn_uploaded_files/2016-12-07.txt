Seems like practice made it perfect, said Darmeega Selvarajah, captain of Team Sony.
The Red Bull Gravity Challenge attracted 242 teams with over 1000 spectators. Not all the teams managed to get their eggs landing safe and sound but some dropped it unscathed from 15 metres without being damaged.
Each team of three was given one minute to climb the 15 metre platform and drop their device. An independent jury evaluated their creativity and the idea behind the egg-landing device.

## Title: SLC sows the seeds to win next World Cup

SLC sows the seeds to win next World Cup
Sri Lanka Cricket is certainly on a mission. That mission is totally focused on winning the 2009 Cricket World Cup in England. The last few weeks has seen SLC spearheaded by its energetic president Thilanga Sumathipala making their intentions clear in no uncertain manner.
The decision to invite former Pakistan captain legendary left-arm fast bowler Wasim Akram to help weed out potential fast bowlers was one such move. Although the visit was brief Akram who was the chief guest at the Dialog Cricket Awards spent a day with the Lankan squad of fast bowlers and what he saw impressed him.
After spending several hours with the national teams main established strike bowlers and promising youngsters, Akram said there was no lack of raw pace, but they needed to develop their ability to swing the ball.
Most of the bowlers had a pace of 130 to 140 kmph, said Akram, who himself bowled at a similar pace in his prime in the 1990s. The idea is to teach them how to believe in themselves and how to fox out the batsmen.
According to the SLC chief, Akram was invited to mentor local players in the next two years and visit the country at least twice a year.
We have invited him to be with us in the next two years as our consultant in pace bowling, said Sumathipala.
Two Sri Lankan legends Aravinda de Silva and Chaminda Vaas who played against the Pakistan swing king have already been designated roles by SLC towards building up a team to win the World Cup.
De Silva, one of the greatest batsmen produced by the country heads the SLC Cricket Committee where important decisions pertaining to the national team is taken and Vaas, a former left-arm seamer and Sri Lankas leading fast bowler was recently tasked with identifying fast bowling talent across the country.
In a recent development, former Test captain and solid middle-order batsman Hashan Tillakaratne and former all-rounder Upul Chandana who was an outstanding fielder during his playing days were drafted into the SLCs Skill Development Program which is run under the supervision of High Performance Manager Simon Willis, the former Kent coach.
Willis was of the opinion that Sri Lanka has a lot of talented youngsters and this development program has identified 20 fast bowlers to be trained under a long term plan. Our plan is to have a back up to be used as the requirement of the national side, said Willis.
De Silva who is playing a pivotal role in this operation said on the recruitment of Tillakaratne and Chandana, that SLC has launched a long term program to develop cricket and the two former cricketers have joined to educate and share their vast knowledge with young cricketers.
De Silva said that he intends roping in former greats like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Asanka Gurusinha and Muthiah Muralitharan in the future.
De Silva has been responsible for SLC recruiting former South African wicket-keeper Nic Pothas as the national fielding coach in July to improve the national teams fielding standards which had dipped over the years to lower levels.
Commenting on that appointment Sumathipala said, It is the focus of my administration to build Sri Lankas next world champion team. We will deploy the necessary resources and invest in the infrastructure to make this happen.
We always believe in engaging the best professional advice and technical support for our national team, and this appointment is one such positive step. Our last few outings are showing a marked improvement in the batting and bowling both, however our fielding has been letting us down and Pothas joining the support team already in place will give the necessary boost to this important area.
With Sri Lanka Cricket going out hammer and tongs by recruiting the best possible support staff to enable the national team to bring back the World Cup which they last won 20 years ago, it is the duty of the national cricketers to make maximum use of the facilities that are being provided to them by the controlling body to raise their performances to a level that should see them achieve their ultimate goal.
SLC have already acquired the services of De Silva, Vaas, Tillakaratne and Chandana  all four of whom were members of Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup winning squad. With more to follow SLC are not leaving any stone unturned towards achieving their goal.
The World Cup is another 30 months away but SLC has already started to sow the seeds that could make winning the most prized possession in cricket a reality.

Federer, Serena skip IPTL over India cash crunch
NEW DELHI: Tennis stars Roger Federer and Serena Williams have both pulled out of an exhibition tournament in India next week as a result of the country's cash crunch, organisers said Tuesday.
The two former world number ones had been the big-name draws of the Indian leg of this year's International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) which is scheduled to take place in Hyderabad from December 9-11.
But the IPTL said in a statement it was "sad to announce that Roger Federer and Serena Williams won't participate at this year's IPTL", citing the "uncertainty" sparked by the government's decision last month to withdraw high-denomination notes from circulation.
"We have had challenges this year, and we were hoping to get past them," said Mahesh Bhupathi, the veteran Indian tennis player who is a founder and managing director of the IPTL.
"With the current economic climate in India and the uncertainty of spending money, I reached out to both Roger and Serena to explain the situation," said Bhupathi, but he was ultimately unable to convince them to appear as planned.
"They have been both been very supportive of the IPTL the first two seasons and we look forward to bring them in future years."
The tournament was to have marked the comeback of 35-year-old Federer, who has been sidelined since July with knee problems.
The government's so-called "demonetisation" scheme has caused major cash shortages across India, with big queues outside banks now commonplace after authorities placed a daily limit on withdrawals.
Hyderabad is the third and final leg of this year's IPTL which promotes a shortened version of the game that organisers say is more television-friendly than the traditional format.
The first leg was held in Tokyo from December 2-4, while the second leg begins later Tuesday in Singapore. AFP

Sudamericana title given to plane crash team
ASUNCION: South American football confederation CONMEBOL agreed Monday to award the Copa Sudamericana to Brazilian club Chapecoense, whose team was wiped out in a plane crash while heading to the final.
The body issued a statement announcing the posthumous honor to the previously unsung club, which was having a fairy tale season until the disaster a week ago.
Chapecoense vice-president Ivan Tozzo hailed the decision as "justice."
"We were sure that 'Chape' would be champions. It is a beautiful tribute," he told a news conference.
The charter plane flying the team to the biggest match in its history ran out of fuel and crashed into the mountains in northwestern Colombia.
A total of 71 people died -- most of the club members, including players, management and staff. Three players, two crew members and a journalist survived.
The side was heading to play the first leg of the Copa Sudamericana final against Colombian club Atletico Nacional in the city of Medellin.
Nacional responded to the crash by calling for Chapecoense to be granted the Copa Sudamericana, the second highest club football title in South America.
The Paraguay-based confederation said Monday it had heeded Nacional's request in deciding to hand the title to Chapecoense.
"CONMEBOL awards the title for the 2016 Copa Sudamericana championship to Chapecoense," including the $2 million in prize money, the confederation said in a statement.
It awarded Nacional its $1 million CONMEBOL Centenary Fair Play award.
"There is no greater demonstration of the spirit of understanding and fair play... than the consideration and respect shown by Atletico Nacional to its brothers in Chapecoense Football Club," the statement said.
The small Brazilian city of Chapeco held a massive funeral on Saturday for its team after the victims' coffins arrived home, each draped in the club's green and white flag.
A minute's silence for the team was scheduled to be held before every Champions League and Europa League game this week.
Chapeco awoke meanwhile to the steep task of rebuilding a top-flight team from virtually nothing.
"We have lost practically all our assets," said Tozzo last week.
He took over from president Sandro Pallaoro, who died in the crash.
"After everything we have achieved, now we have to start again from scratch," Tozzo said.
"We will have to start to think, because we do not have 11 players to put on the field.
"We will need a great deal of help from the Brazilian Football Federation and the broadcaster Globo," which owns the rights to screen the matches, he added. AFP

Westbrook bags sixth triple-double
LOS ANGELES: Russell Westbrook motored to his sixth straight triple-double on Monday as the Oklahoma City Thunder squeezed past the Atlanta Hawks 102-99.
Westbrook moved to within one game of equaling Michael Jordan's seven consecutive triples in 1989 when he secured his 10th assist midway through the third quarter.
Westbrook eventually finished with 32 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists as the Thunder improved to 14-8.
The 28-year-old is now three away from matching the legendary Wilt Chamberlain's all-time record of nine consecutive triple-doubles set in 1968.
Westbrook has compiled 11 triple-doubles so far this season -- the same number as the rest of the NBA combined.
"What Russell is doing is incredible, remarkable. It's something the league hasn't seen like this in a long, long time," Thunder coach Billy Donovan said. "But I also give Russell, and our guys, a lot of credit. We're a team... They're all trying to make each other better."
The Thunder were left grateful for Westbrook's steadying influence after they fought off a late Atlanta rally on Monday.
The Hawks had suffered blowout defeats in their previous two games, losing by 36 and 44 points.
However they fought back from 15 points down to move within three at 90-87 midway through the fourth quarter.
Westbrook reasserted control with seven unanswered points before adding two free throws with 1:18 remaining to put Oklahoma City into a winning position.
Westbrook, who is averaging triple double numbers for the season of 31 points, 10.9 rebounds and 11.3 assists, made 10 of 22 from the floor and 9 of 14 from the foul line.
"He does so many different things," said Thabo Sefolosha, Westbrook's former Thunder teammate who was given the thankless task of attempting to guard him.
"He has such a high energy level. You have to try to take his air space, contest his shot. He made a bunch tonight."
Donovan meanwhile praised Westbrook's ability to read the game before choosing when to strike.
"I think he was just kind of biding his time, seeing what was going to be open," Donovan said.
"He's reading the game in his mind and then he's going to take advantage of the opportunities that he thinks are there." AFP
