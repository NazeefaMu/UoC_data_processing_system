Skating on thin ice
Franchaises have a nostalgic quality about them. The Ice age series is evergreen. Manny, Sid and Diego have been on our favourite list ever since animations made their way to the screen and became the fad.
The movie starts on a promising note with Manny, the woolly mammoth showing the classic symptoms of being in a long-term relationship by forgetting his wedding anniversary. Trouble arises when we discover that his wife, Ellie, has not forgotten it. However these issues are just butter on the toast since a lot of gags  many which miss the shot  are aimed at the viewers. Manny also has trouble reconciling with the idea that his daughter Peaches could potentially leave the family for boyfriend Julian.
Director Mike Thurmeier seem to have run out of ideas because he has failed to capture the uniqueness that all the previous Ice Age movies boasted of. This is a tried-and-tested formula which seem to be brought out again and again with each animation which hits the big screen.
Co-directors Thurmeier and Chu rely too heavily on slapstick shenanigans to keep the proceedings clipping along. Despite their combined efforts, the film never achieves the sense of fun or genuine excitement that marked some of the earlier editions.
Impending doom
Scratwith his acorn
Like always theres an impending doom on planet Earth thanks to the misadventures of Scrat, the saber toothed squirrel. The hurtling asteroid, of course, is his handiwork as he continues his epic struggle with his beloved acorn, redefin all-consuming obsession. Somehow, in the process, he manages to kickstart a series of disastrous spatial events that threaten earths existence.
Scrats the first person on the moon, Scrat is the reason Mars is devoid of life, Scrat gave Saturn its rings Scrat is everywhere but where he should really be. The character has generally excelled as an enjoyable distraction in previous Ice Age films and continues to be so in Collision Course.
While these new characters add freshness to the plot, even their designs arent anything new. Shangri Llama looks like a slavish copy of the Yoga guru Llama from Zootopia, that release earlier this year. The Dromaesours family consisting of an evil Dad and his reluctantly grey shaded son and daughter is straight out of Hollywood family movie stereotypes book. The standard love interest role that was portrayed by Jennifer Lopezs Shira in the last movie has now been conceded to Brooke the Sloth.
Funny scenes
Collision Course has its share of funny scenes. For example Sid, in the clutches of love, says, Im getting butterflies, and Manny reacts with a Im getting nauseous. All of Scrats antics are enjoyable. Buck is a riot too, especially as Neil Debuck Weasel, the astronomer inside Bucks head who helps save the world.
The filmmakers seem to depend far too heavily on the affability of the A-list voice cast, which includes John Leguizamo as the lovelorn sloth, Queen Latifah as the mammoths missus, and Jennifer Lopez in the role of the middle-aged white tigress.
The Ice Age movie franchise is 14 years old. Collision Course is the fifth installment. Sadly the formula is getting old and the imagination of the makers looks a bit jaded too. The ideas behind the movies has gotten old and monotonous. Sadly the makers behind this franchise is content with reworking the same old. So before we get a sixth installment it is best to bid the endangered species adieu.
Ice Age: Collision Course is screening at Majestic Cineplex, Liberty Lite cinema and Savoy cinema, Wellawaththa.

Hrithiks Mohenjo Daroexperience
Makers of Mohenjo Daro have extensively shot in Bhuj for the film. In fact, the bigger coincidence was that Ashutosh had also shot one of his hit and critically loved films, Lagaan in the same place. The Mohenjo Daro set was constructed on the same land where the Lagaan cricket ground was made.
The team was pleasantly surprised to see that the cement platform created to make the cricket pavilion during Lagaan was still there in Bhuj when they arrived for Mohenjo Daro and it continues to be there.
During Lagaan, the crew and the unit of the film stayed in residential apartments as back then Bhuj didnt have many hotels or infrastructure. However now, Bhuj has become far more developed with so many more hotels and infrastructure. But at the same time, it continues to be a very sweet, positive, clean town which made the experience so memorable for the entire team.
With the kind of vision that Ashutosh had for the film, there were about 300 crew people on set all the time during the shooting in Bhuj.
Also what many dont know is the fact that there are several localities of Bhuj who have also got cast in the film! The makers held a full-fledged audition for all the locals of Bhuj.
Hrithik will be seen romancing Pooja Hegde on the celluloid which has also created intrigue amongst audiences. Mohenjo Daros trailer released and proved to be a visual spectacle, rising anticipation levels of the audience. Presented by UTV Motion Pictures and Ashutosh Gowariker Productions, and produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur and Sunita Gowariker, the film will release worldwide on August 12.

Arpita opens up about Salman Khans wedding
The rumours about Salman Khan tying the knot with Iulia Vantur have been doing the rounds for quite a while now.
In fact, some time back, Bhai stated that he would be getting married on November 18 but the year had not been finalized. During a recently held event, Salmans sister Arpita was asked a question about his impending marriage. Replying to the query, she refused to offer a comment, reported Pinkvilla. I am not answering that question, you can ask him to talk about it, she added.
Interestingly, this is an exciting time for Salman. His latest release Sultan opened to a thunderous response at the box office earlier this month.
At present, he gearing up to begin work on his next film Tubelight which will be directed by Kabir Khan.
Moreover, on the personal front, the Rajasthan High Court recently acquitted him in the 18-year-old Chinkara/ black buck poaching case. Pinkvilla

Beauty and the Beast is just the ticket after Colony
Here in a suite in the Corinthia Hotel in central London is Emma Watson. She is here to discuss her latest project, a thriller set in a cult in Chile during the Pinochet dictatorship. It shouts serious cinema, another step in the carefully curated career of the girl known to the world as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films. There are absolutely no owls in this cast.
Watson is now a woman of many parts: a UN goodwill ambassador, a founder of the equality campaign HeForShe and a feminist book club, and a model for Burberry and Lancome. She recently has been inducted into the Oscar voting academy, and also has been rock-solid in her support for the black actress playing the grown-up Hermione on the West End stage in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
She has been on the big screen for 15 years, yet she is only 25. I realise that I have interviewed her three times, watching her grow up in public from a fuzzy-edged teenager into a sleek, sophisticated cog in the movie-making machine.
In The Colony, set in 1973, Watson plays Lena, an air stewardess who goes undercover to join the cult and find her German boyfriend Daniel (Daniel Bruhl, star of Rush and Inglourious Basterds), who has been kidnapped.
Watsons previous post-Potter films, such as My Week With Marilyn, The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Bling Ring, were decidedly lighter in tone  or sillier if we include Noah and the comedy-disaster This is the End.
Were definitely not in rom-com territory with The Colony  not that theres anything wrong with rom-coms, she says of the film, which made just $81 in its opening weekend in Britain earlier this month. But its pretty dark material. It was a really interesting paradigm switch  the fact that I got to play a girl who rescues a boy.

K-POP rocks in Sri Lanka
Shaping your mind and body to appreciate a foreign culture is one thing, but shaping your voice to sing in anothers language or to fight in anothers traditional martial art form is another.
Singing in a language other than your native tongue can be a daunting task for any singer. It takes more practice than singing in your own tongue. There will be many words you will find difficult to pronounce or articulate. You have to focus on syllables and sounds, might as well have to break down each word in order to learn its diction. It necessitates application and training. The end result is going to be that you will realize that you have participated in anothers culture. The reward is the joy that you actually lived in it.
A contestantsingingher heartout
Such joy has been experienced amid much appreciation for Korean culture by all who participated at the Korean Cultural Festival 2016 on Saturday (July 23) at Musaeus College Auditorium, Colombo.
The festival consisted of Korean Ambassadors Kukkiwon Cup Taekwondo Championship and National Preliminary Selection Round for Koreas K-Pop World Festival 2016. Minister of Sports Dayasiri Jayasekara, President of the Sri Lanka Taekwondo Federation Harshana Rajakaruna were chief guests.
When Sri Lankas K-poppers for national selections hit the stage they absolutely raised the roof. They delighted a full- packed house with an estimated 1500 people at Musaeus College Auditorium with some of the hottest K-pop songs.
Nineteen candidates were in the line for K-pop international selections, having been selected out of hundreds of candidates who had applied for the selection process. Boy dance groups, girl dance groups, beat bands and female and male singers were among the selected group of nineteen.
These artistes and dancers got the audience on the feet in no time. Some of them seemed nervous and others seemed excited. All in all they all gave an allencompassing exciting K-pop evening that evening. They dazzled the audience with dance-pop, pop ballads, slow rock, electro-pop, R&B and hip hop. They love what they did and enjoyed it thoroughly.

They brought to life South Korean pop on stage. It saw two cultures in embrace and perfect pitch. K-pop spread with excitement and fun. The local boys and girls stunned the audience with their singing and notably their diction of Korean language. They were singing and dancing in a professional environment. The vocalists delivered some signature K-Pop singles by top K-pop artistes. They also sang what are billed as hot favorites of K-pop.
The five male lineup Lalith Dance Group won the grand prize, a trip to Korea courtesy Korean Air. They are to perform at the K-Pop World Festival 2016 which will be held in Changwon, Korea on September 30. They put up a winning act, not only in terms of power and energy they threw during their performance, but also dramatic intensity they created on stage.
Dishad Lankesha Weerasinghe of Ananda College and Harini Diaz were declared the Best Singers and were given awards of excellence and trophies.
Dishad and Harini were indeed outstanding. They sang with power, vocal agility, good technique, natural vibrato and in perfect pitch. Moreover their Korean articulation was extremely good.
Korean Ambassador to Sri Lanka Won-Sam Chang who made K-pop, a successful event in Sri Lanka, had these words to share with the audience and the contestants:
We have received so many applications from Sri Lanka for the K-Pop festival this year. Although some were not elected for the events national preliminary round of the festival, I must say they were all impressive and possessed with special skills. If they work harder and practice from now on they may be able to secure a place for the selections next year.
I believe that music and dance are art forms that can express ones inner self. I know that remembering words and phrases of a foreign language and execute their diction while singing is not at all an easy task. Hence I greatly appreciate the effort and the commitment of those who will sing today at the festival.
I hope that this event has given you opportunity to learn about the Korean culture. I hope that Sri Lanka-Korean relations will grow as a result of events like this. The Korean Embassy is at the ready to organize similar events for this purpose.

Spice Girls trio to earn $14 million each for one-off gig
Spice Girls bandmates Mel B, Geri Horner and Emma Bunton will pick up $14 million (10 million) each for a two-hour long performance, according to new reports. The girl group celebrated the 20th anniversary of its first single Wannabe earlier this summer (16), and Scary Spice, Ginger Spice, and Baby Spice have teamed up to stage a show to mark the occasion in London's Hyde Park next summer (17). Renamed GEM, they will perform without bandmates Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) and Melanie Chisholm (Sporty Spice), who have refused to be part of the get together, but the fact that all five original members won't be part of the show hasn't stopped promoters and big sponsors throwing money at the three remaining Spice Girls.
Insiders now claim the singing trio will pocket $14 million each from the gig - that's over $100,000 (74,000)-a-minute per person. GEM may not have Posh and Sporty, but the commercial opportunities for the girls is still huge, the source tells the New York Daily News. In addition to their huge one-off performance pay-out, executives at huge international companies are reportedly eager to provide sponsorship and endorsement deals ranging in the tens of millions to support the nostalgia comeback the Spice Girls reunion will provide for fans around the world.

India builds big lead after Rahul century
KINGSTON, Sunday - Opening batsman Lokesh Rahul scored a career-high 158 as India consolidated their dominance on day two of the second test against West Indies in Jamaica on Sunday.
India scored slowly, adding only 232 runs off 88 overs, while losing four wickets on a day that will not go down as one of the most compelling in cricket history.
The visitors were 358 for five in their first innings by close of play at Sabina Park in Kingston, a lead of 162 runs with five wickets in hand.
The Windies attack bowled with discipline and while they did not exactly terrorise the batsmen, they at least kept them mostly in check.
Not that India were under any pressure to score quickly. With three days left, they have time on their side and seem determined to grind out a big lead.
Rahul posted his third century after just 11 test innings in his burgeoning career.
He faced 303 balls before being dismissed by fast bowler Shannon Gabriel, caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich.
My mindset was to play positively, Rahul said in an on-field interview.
The wicket was a little slow when we started but it got better as the day went on but the bowlers kept putting the ball in the right area, so it was hard to get runs today.
The weather was really, really hot. That was the biggest challenge for me.
I was cramping.
Rahul was the only Indian batsman to get past 50.
Number three Cheteshwar Pujara scored a painstaking 46 off 159 balls before being run out by a sharp piece of fielding from Roston Chase, who scored a direct hit from more than 20 metres.
And captain Virat Kohli, coming off a double century in the first test won by India, accrued 44 before being caught at short-leg off the bowling of off-spinner Chase.
I got one to get a bit of extra bounce and that was the end of him, Chase said.
We didnt get the wickets as we liked but they didnt run away with the score (as in) the first match, so that was one positive.
All-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin, who took five wickets with the ball on Saturday, could not emulate that success with the bat, falling to leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo, lbw for three.

Djokovic beats Nishikori in Rogers Cup final
TORONTO, Sunday - World number one Novak Djokovic continued his dominance of Kei Nishikori with a 6-3 7-5 victory in the final of the Rogers Cup in Toronto on Sunday.
After clinching his 30th ATP World Tour Masters 1000 title, Djokovic immediately started to turn his attention to something more elusive, an Olympic gold medal.
In his first tournament since an upset third round loss to American Sam Querrey on the grass of Wimbledon four weeks ago, Djokovic returned to his winning ways and became the first four-time winner of the Rogers Cup. The 29-year-old Serb seized the opening set in just over 30 minutes, and then dug deep during a spirited back and forth in the final stages of the hardcourt match. Djokovic was bolstered by a strong service performance as he won 82 percent of his first serve points and recorded five aces.
I worked on it (with my coach), Djokovic, who struggled on serve earlier in the tournament, said in a courtside interview.
I had to change something, I was not getting many of the free points (as I did today).
It allowed me to be more aggressive. It was my best (serving) performance of the week.
With the second set tied at 5-5 and the score at deuce, Djokovic won a pair of rallies to earn the decisive break.
Djokovic put extra loft on a forehead to create an unforced error from Nishikori on game point, before triumphantly pointing at his head to illustrate his savvy.
He served out to close the match.
Nishikori fought hard to stay in the final set but seemed to be bothered by his rackets as he made multiple trips to the side of the court to change.
The Japanese player recorded his fourth straight Memphis title in February for his 11th ATP Tour victory, but he cannot seem to solve the worlds top player and has now lost nine straight times to Djokovic.
It was a shame to lose but this was my first time final here in Toronto, Nishikori told the Canadian crowd. So, it was a great week.
Djokovic, a 12-time grand slam champion, will now turn his focus to the Rio Olympics, a tournament he has yet to conquer.
He earned a bronze medal in singles at Beijing in 2008 and fell just short of a medal at London in 2012.
I dont need to explain that every athlete dreams of being a part of the Olympic Games, he said.
Im competing in singles and doubles. Hopefully Ill get at least one medal. - Agencies
