More Chinese companies keen on biz opportunities in Lanka
More new Chinese companies are looking for opportunities to do more business with Sri Lanka, said Standard Chartered Bank CEO, Jim McCabe.
Speaking at Shangri-La Hotel Colombo recently, he said that the China-led Belt and Road initiative and Sri Lanka being involved in it is one reason for this eagerness.
Asked if Sri Lankan political situation was also been discussed by potential investors, he said that they do question but Chinese investors dont shun away. He said that there was keen investor interest especially in the Hambantota port and the investment zone which runs through a larger area. We forecast that there will be a lot of new investment for this zone.
The CEO also said the proposed economic zone in Horana by Rotana Thailand too is being talked about by investors and they were also keen about the PPP model especially for the proposed Colombo Kandy highway and extension of the Southern highway to Hambantota.
He also identified Colombo International Container Terminal, the Port City as other areas that would woo investors.
Head of Banking Standard Chartered Bank (China) Sam Xu said that the Standard Chartered Bank has already been involved in more than 50 deals in 2017, worth more than $10 billion, across a range of products and services. He said that that was increasing with around half of them been in Africa, a quarter in South Asia including Sri Lanka and the remainder from across the rest of the Belt and Road footprint. Standard Chartered has the strength to enable our clients to take advantage of the benefits presented by this initiative and we are well positioned to support Sri Lanka to expand its economic relationship with China.
Xu said that Belt and Road will also bring more cooperation opportunities for Sri Lanka and China. The Belt and Road initiative was proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2013 to create an economic cooperation strategy, involving billions of dollars of trade and investment, as well as policy coordination across dozens of countries in Asia and beyond.
He said that today China is one of the Banks biggest clients followed by Japan, Korea, Singapore and Malaysia when it comes to banking with Sri Lanka.

Writing is a Necessity
The first book I read of Anita Desai was Fire on the Mountain, borrowed from the university library during my undergrad days. It was not the kind of book I usually read, back then. Nanda Kaul, the protagonist was old. She had retreated to the high mountains to spend her last years in isolation with the fond hope of finding spiritual peace. Sure, the book was a slow-drip tale, slower than the 154 bus I took to uni and back every day. Yet, I read it in one breath. It was not the plot that captivated me, but the prose  prose that so courageously broke all of George Orwells celebrated rules for writers.
Now that I have read several other books by Desai I know for a fact that she uses a large number of words to make a scene more vivid, more alive. When you turn randomly to a page in a book like Clear Light of Day, you come across a description like the following  that of a cat descending a tree. She came slithering down the satiny bark, growling and grumbling with petulance and complaint at her undignified descent. Then she was in Bims arms cuddled and cushioned and petted... Later on the same page, we have a middle-aged character named Bakul sitting flaccidly, flabbily on a chair. A critic making a case for lucidity might argue that just one of those words could serve the purpose, but in Desais work adjectives and adverbs (carefully chosen ones, of course) accumulate to make a picture even more immediate. As critic Jai Arjun Singh says, Desais style shows us that good writing doesnt necessarily have to be spare and direct. Also, her overdose of words sometimes conveys the perspective of a particular character  a thoughtful character who is not a writer by profession and who doesnt have to feel conscious about using too many words. Seen out of context, ...growling and grumbling with petulance and complaint at her undignified descent may seem like over-writing, but consider how this word arrangement reflects Bims perspective of her beloved pet, apart from adding humour and affection to the scene.
Desai is also interesting because of the way she looks at translators. In her latest work, The Artist of Disappearance she writes of a professor named Perma Joshi who translates a novel from an Indian language  and finds that she loves how powerful it makes her feel. (This leads her to change the original text in the belief she is doing a favor to the writer whose work she is translating.) Desai says she based the story on translators that she has known over the years. I realized that all translators, they all long to be writers themselves, she explains. If they didnt have that longing, they probably wouldnt be very good translators, but a lot of them do have that creative urge  and my character Perma Joshi simply gets carried away with that. She says she has never felt that her own work was translated unfaithfully, but her daughter, Kiran Desai, once wrote a very funny book that, when translated into Scandinavian languages, didnt make anyone laugh. There was no humor left in it whatsoever.
As one of Indias most celebrated writers, Anita Desai has been publishing for almost 50 years and came close to winning the Booker Prize three times. (Ironically, her daughter, Kiran beat her to it in 2006 for The Inheritance of Loss.) Desais novels include Clear Light of Day (1980); In Custody, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1984 and made into a film; Baumgartners Bombay (1987); Fasting, Feasting (1999); and The Zigzag Way (2004).
Talking about her childhood in an interview on CNN Desai said that from a young age she had wanted to be a writer. My family would see me sitting in a corner, scribbling all the time, so they used to address me as The Writer. I just wanted my books to be on the bookshelf too.
She recalls her mother who was German, was a wonderful storyteller. She could tell us the familiar Grimms fairy tales, but as no one else has ever told them to me. Ive never heard them so wonderfully embroidered. In the same way, she could tell us about things like Christmas in Germany, or Easter, or skating on frozen lakes and eating strawberries in summer. It was all like fairy tales to us  it didnt resemble anything in our own world. We thought of them as these marvelous stories she spun, not realizing until we were grown up how much deep homesickness and nostalgia this must have come out of. She never spoke about that to us. I visited Berlin [years later]. At that time there was still a wall across the city, so it didnt resemble at all what my mother had evoked in her stories. Besides, so much of it had been flattened during the war, and what had come up was a mostly modern city. It was very painful for me to go back and tell her that actually I couldnt find any of the things that she had told me to go and look for.
Desai wrote most of her novels while bringing up four children. When asked how she managed to be a mother as well as a writer in India she says, As a woman, youre expected to lead a certain kind of life. To do anything other than that is not looked upon as normal and one has to find a way to justify it. For instance, it wasnt expected of me to have a career and this is something I fought against...I wanted to open a door and step out into the world which lay right outside. Step into it and see what was happening there, and write about that.
She did not expect her children to follow in her footsteps and was pleasantly surprised when her daughter became a writer. All my children told me they never wanted to become writers, Desai recalls. They said, You lead such a boring life. We dont want to live like you do. 
Nevertheless she had always told her daughter Kiran that she wrote wonderful letters, but it wasnt until Kirans college professors encouraged her to write that she really took it seriously. Now the mother and daughter write together, in the same house. Its wonderful to be able to talk about our work, about each others work, about the books we are reading, says Desai.
As with most writers, Desai too is never satisfied with what she writes. Usually, a feeling of disappointment follows the book, she confesses. Because what I hoped to write is not what I actually accomplished. However, it becomes a motivation to write the next book.

ADB, UK establish fund to improve trade, connectivity in Asia-Pacific
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of the United Kingdom, through its Department for International Development (DFID), yesterday launched the Asia Regional Trade and Connectivity Fund (ARTCF) ahead of the Annual Meeting of ADBs Board of Governors in Manila, Philippines.
The fund, to be administered by ADB, will provide support to address some of the frontier challenges ADB members face in improving regional integration, such as enabling private sector development and addressing regional public goods. DFID will provide an initial contribution of up to $30 million. The ARTCF will initially focus on eight Central and South Asian countries, specifically Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, the Kyrgyz Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.
In line with ADBs Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 20162020, ARTCF will help the selected ADB developing member countries to identify and design projects that improve cross-border transport, energy, and information and communications technology infrastructure. It will also help recipients of the fund tackle red tape and regulatory bottlenecks; provide financing for regional projects to increase their poverty reduction and gender impacts; and strengthen the capacity of the member countries for prospective investments.
The fund was launched at an event attended by ADB Vice-President for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development Bambang Susantono, ADB Vice-President for Private Sector and Cofinancing Operations Diwakar Gupta, ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada, and DFID Asia Regional Deputy Head Duncan Overfield. ADBs partnership with DFID will help further our ambitious knowledge-driven agenda and ensure that our members have access to the most effective, evidence-based solutions to further their regional integration goals, said Susantono. Let me extend my special appreciation to DFID for its support on new regional cooperation and integration areas.
One of ADBs core goals is to help our member countries work, trade, and connect more easily with each other and across the region, said Mr. Gupta. ADBs partnership with DFID will strengthen regional cooperation and integration operations while addressing some of the regions most important development priorities. Since joining in 1966 as a founding member, the Government of the United Kingdom has contributed $3.09 billion in capital subscription to ADB and committed $1.43 billion to the banks Special Funds as of 31 December 2017.
ADB and DFIDs first cofinancing collaboration was in 1996, and since then, the two institutions have partnered on poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, finance, health, climate change, and public and private partnerships to benefit the people of the Asia and Pacific region.

Apple in $100bn share buyback as revenue rises 16 %
Apple is returning another $100bn (73bn) to shareholders from its huge cash pile as solid iPhone sales helped revenues rise 16% to just over $61bn.
The company sold 52.2 million iPhones in the three months to March - only a touch below expectations, despite waning global demand for smart phones.
Revenues at Apples services business that includes Apple Music and the App Store jumped almost a third to $9.1bn.
Apple has about $145bn in the bank, but plans to return the cash to investors.
After the announcement, Apple shares rose 3% in after-hours trading on Wall Street.
Although the share buyback helped push the shares higher, overall the quarter was impressive, said Ben Stanton, an analyst at Canalys.
It looks like on pretty much every front Apple has had a win, he said.
The company, flush with a huge cash pile on strong earnings boosted by the US tax cut plan of 2017, also announced a 16% boost to its quarterly dividend.
That came on top of $22.8bn in buybacks executed in the prior quarter,Overall Apple reported a 3% rise in the number of phones sold, while revenue from phones jumped 14%, reflecting more expensive models.
Some analysts had questioned whether demand for the most expensive iPhone would hold up after the initial rush.
But Apple said the iPhone X was the best-selling model in every week of the quarter - despite costing almost $1,000 or 1,000.
The average selling prices came in at $728, below analyst expectations of $742, which finance chief Luca Maestri blamed on clearing stocks of older models.
On a call with financial analysts, chief executive Tim Cook dismissed concerns about soft demand for smart phones, pointing to the millions of people who still do not own one.
We still believe that over time every phone sold will be a smart phone, so it seems to us... thats a pretty big opportunity, he said on a call with investors.
The iPhone continues to account for the bulk of Apples revenues at just over 62% of the total. Sales of iPads rose 2% to 9.1 million units compared with the same period last year, while Mac sales slipped 3% to 4.07 million.
Apples services unit added 30 million subscriptions in the past 90 days alone, bringing the total to 270 million.
Mr Stanton said that growth underlined a shift in strategy to develop businesses outside its core products: This is the future of Apple.
Overall profits in the quarter were $13.8bn, up a quarter from the same period in 2017.
The firms revenue hit a record for the March quarter, which follows the Christmas rush and is traditionally one of the companys weaker periods.
Sales growth of more than 20% in Japan and the greater China market - a critical area for the company - helped to lift the numbers.
Mr Cook said Apple had the three top-selling phones in China and brushed aside concerns about how a brewing tariff fight between the US and China, where many of its phones are made, could hurt the company.
I think theres a lot of things that bind the countries together and Im actually very optimistic, he said.
Apple bought shares worth $23.5bn in the three months to March. It has purchased about $200bn of stock since 2012.

Australia chief sees way back for Warner
Sydney: Disgraced David Warner still has a future in Australian cricket, the sport's chief executive James Sutherland says, handing the explosive opener a lifeline after a cheating scandal.
Warner was identified as the mastermind behind the plan to use sandpaper to tamper with the ball during the third Test in South Africa this year that shocked the sport.
While former skipper Steve Smith was charged with knowledge of the plot, Warner was charged with developing it and instructing Cameron Bancroft to carry it out.
Smith and then vice-captain Warner were banned for 12 months while Bancroft was exiled for nine months.
All three held emotional press conferences to apologise, with public sympathy for a contrite Smith and Bancroft.
Warner, who was also banned from ever holding a leadership role again in Australian cricket, admitted he was "resigned to the fact" he may never play for his country again.
But Sutherland said the door remained open.
"I think everyone deserves their chance and their own personal redemption story is very much in their own hands now," he told Melbourne radio station SEN late Tuesday. AFP

Boeing to buy aerospace  parts maker KLX
Plane maker Boeing Co said on Tuesday it will buy aerospace parts company KLX Inc for about $3.2 billion in cash to expand its aircraft services business.
The $63-per-share deal gives KLX an enterprise value of $4.25 billion, including about $1 billion of net debt.
The acquisition is contingent upon the successful divestment and separation of KLXs Energy Services Group business, KLX said.
KLX stock has risen about 24 percent since Dec. 22, when the company said it will review strategic alternatives including a potential sale.
Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said last week its services growth would be complemented by strategic acquisitions.
The plane maker said there will be no change to its 2018 guidance or capital deployment strategy and expects annual cost savings of about $70 million by 2021.
Last year, Boeing launched a global services business which announced deals worth nearly $1 billion in February to capture more of the higher-margin services and spare-parts revenue.
KLX will be part of Boeing Global Services and will be merged with Aviall, Boeings parts, equipment and services unit.
The combined business will provide a one-stop-shop that will benefit its supply chain and customers, said Stan Deal, chief executive of Boeing Global Services.
Goldman Sachs advised KLX on the deal, while Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP was its legal counsel.

British Consumer borrowing slows  ahead of interest rate decision
Growth in unsecured lending - including loans, credit cards and overdrafts - slowed sharply further easing pressure on interest rate policymakers.
The chances of a Bank rate rise in May have receded in recent days amid signs of slowing economic growth.Bank of England figures now show that consumers unsecured borrowing slowed from a 9.4% annual rise in February to an 8.6% increase in March.
Manufacturing growth was also slower than expected, a survey suggested.The latest manufacturing purchasing managers index from Markit/CIPS fell to a 17-month low of 53.9 in April from 54.9 the month before, although a figure above 50 still indicates the sector is expanding.
The weaker-than-expected data led to a further fall in the pound, with sterling at a three-and-a-half-month low against the dollar on Tuesday morning, dropping below $1.37.A series of lacklustre economic data raises the question of whether the Bank of England will go ahead with an interest rate rise when its Monetary Policy Committee meets next week. Growing consumer borrowing has been one of the factors that policymakers have taken into consideration. However, annual growth has been falling, owing in part to the bad weather curtailing potential spending on credit cards on the High Street.
Until recently, analysts had expected policymakers to raise interest rates in May, and possibly then again later in the year.
That would have brought some cheer to savers who have witnessed years of low returns.
However, official figures released last week suggested the UK economy grew at its slowest rate since 2012 in the first quarter of the year, expanding by just 0.1%.

Cambridge Analytica: Facebook data-harvest firm to shut

Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy at the centre of the Facebook data-sharing scandal, is shutting down.
The firm was accused of improperly obtaining personal information on behalf of political clients.
According to Facebook, data about up to 87 million of its members was harvested by a quiz app and then passed on to the political consultancy.
The social network said its own probe into the matter would continue.
"This doesn't change our commitment and determination to understand exactly what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again," said a spokesman.
"We are continuing with our investigation in cooperation with the relevant authorities."
What are the accusations against Cambridge Analytica
The company has been accused of using the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum.
In March, Channel 4 aired undercover footage of Cambridge Analytica's CEO, Alexander Nix, giving examples of how the firm could swing elections around the world with underhand tactics such as smear campaigns and honey traps.
The UK-based company, which denies any wrongdoing, has an extensive record of working abroad on many election campaigns, including in Italy, Kenya and Nigeria.
Why does it is say it is shutting
Clarence Mitchell, a spokesman for Cambridge Analytica, referred the BBC to astatement on the firm's website.
"Over the past several months, Cambridge Analytica has been the subject of numerous unfounded accusations and, despite the company's efforts to correct the record, has been vilified for activities that are not only legal, but also widely accepted as a standard component of online advertising in both the political and commercial arenas," it said.
"Despite Cambridge Analytica's unwavering confidence that its employees have acted ethically and lawfully... the siege of media coverage has driven away virtually all of the company's customers and suppliers.
"As a result, it has been determined that it is no longer viable to continue operating the business."
The statement added that its parent company SCL Elections was also commencing bankruptcy proceedings.
The sting in the tail
When the news of Cambridge Analytica's demise broke here at Facebook's F8 developer conference, it is safe to say few tears were shed.
The scandal over data misuse has been a crisis not just for Facebook but for the thousands of external developers whose access to data has been curbed in response to the affair.
But if they were tempted to celebrate there was a sting in the tail in the political consultancy's statement. It claimed that what it did was not only legal but was standard practice in the world of online advertising.
That rang true to some people in this world and there may be more evidence of such practices as Facebook continues its audit of apps.
Cambridge Analytica may be gone but as more stones are lifted there may be more unpleasant surprises to come about the use and misuse of personal data.

Cathay Pacific Group services expands  to Davao City and Medan
The Cathay Pacific Group will introduce with regional airline Cathay Dragon, two new services, to Davao City and Medan, from 28 and 29 October respectively.
The cities are the eighth and ninth new destinations the group has announced during an unprecedented year of expansion and will boost Hong Kongs connections with two of ASEANs founding member states.
Davao City, the main trade, business and tourism centre of the island of Mindanao in the southern Philippines, will be served four times a week; while Medan, the thriving capital of North Sumatra in Indonesia, will be served three times a week. The new routes, the only non-stop flights between Hong Kong and Davao City and Hong Kong and Medan, will both be operated by Airbus A320 aircraft.
Cathay Pacific Chief Customer and Commercial Officer Paul Loo said the new services reflect the groups commitment to growing its reach to destinations not otherwise served directly from Hong Kong, providing customers with more choice and strengthening Hong Kongs status as Asias largest international aviation hub.
Davao City and Medan are key trade and tourism centres in their respective regions and each looks set play an important role in the Belt and Road Initiative.

The funeral of internationally acclaimed filmmaker Dr. Lester James Peries took place with full state honours, at Independence Square, Colombo, amidst large gathering of artistes, politicians and the public. Mourners from the mighty to the humblest including the leading lights in the film world who appreciated and talked of his immense contribution to the local film industry were present at the funeral.

President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and former President Mahinda Rajapaksa were among the large crowd of mourners who had come to Independence Square to pay their respects to this cinematic genius who left an indelible imprint in the hearts and minds local cinemagoers and the people of Sri Lanka in general.

Stars say a few words
Dharma Sri Abeyratne
Veterans of the film industry expressed their sentiments as they gathered at the Film Corporation to bid adieu to Dr. Lester James Peries yesterday.
Dr. Lester James Peiris is felicitated as he brought the local film industry to the world arena, veteran actor Ravindra Randeniya said. He is the symbol of the Sri Lankan film industry. He introduced many qualified artistes to the film industry through his films. I wonder whether such a capable filmmaker will be in our country even after centuries.
Iconic actress Malani Fonseka said that Dr. Peries is among the four legendary filmmakers in the international film industry. The Sinhala film could reach to the higher and advanced position as a result of his talents and capabilities. When we participated in world film festivals, we saw how he was felicitated by the world as a legend in the film industry, she said.
Douglas Ranasinghe, a veteran actor, said that the vacuum created by the demise of the acclaimed film director could not be filled as there would be no alternative for years. Dr. Peries was an iconic character in the film industry, since he could lift the Sri Lankan film industry to the world, he said. He had a rare talent to read characteristics of actors and actresses and then he gave instructions separately based on the talents and capabilities of each person. He was an actors director.
I, as a newcomer to the film industry met Dr. Peries in late 1960 when he was directing Akkara Paha. The way he directed the film was really exemplary, he said.
When going beyond the legendary role he played as a director, Ranasinghe pointed out that he was a kind-hearted, humble and friendly person who had a flair for joy.
It is significant that he did three rehearsals prior to the shooting, he added. One for camera, second for light, and the third one for him, that is, for the director. Those days it was rather boring, but now we know how what it was worth.
Dilhani Ekanayaka said that Dr. Periess demise is a real loss to the nation. I doubt anyone can render the invaluable service that Dr. Peries did for the Sri Lankan film industry. He lived meaningfully, he served the industry meaningfully.
She further said that Sri Lankans could get a genuine taste of a film by viewing his cinematic masterpieces. The film Nidhanaya is a real treasure for the entire local film industry, she added.
Secretary of the Vocalists Association Janaka Wikremasinghe said Dr. Peries was the symbol of local film industry when considering the unique service he rendered to the film industry. Dr Peries with the assistance of Sunil Shantha opened a new chapter for film songs, he said.
Senior Film Director Chandran Ratnam said that Dr. Peiries was a guiding light for his (Ratnams) film career. With such a guiding light, the local film industry shone and reached heights.
I took part in international film festivals, including the Canness Film Festival and I then understood how he lifted the local film industry to the international stage, he said.
Free Art Guilds (FAG) Chairman Sudath Rohana suggested the establishment of an International Film Study Centre as a mark of respect to the late Dr. Lester James Peries.
Such an International Film Study Centre would not only be a felicitation of the invaluable and iconic film director, but would also bring immense benefits to the young generation entering the film industry.
According to him, Dr. Peries entered the film industry directing the film Rekhawa in 1956 and brought the local film industry to the international level. He is honoured as one of the three iconic film legends in Asian cinema. The other two are Akira Kurasowa (Japan) and Sathyajit Rai (India).

Economy performing well - Central Bank
The Central Bank said that the domestic economy was actually performing well, strengthened by new foreign investment despite news of the Sri Lankan Rupee falling in value to the US Dollar.
A Bank communique said that improved IMF reports, the recent credit upgrades from two top international ratings agencies and strong bond sales were signs of stable, long-term growth.
The full statement:In recent days, serious concerns have been expressed regarding the performance of the Sri Lankan economy. In this context, it is instructive to gauge the level of external support for the Sri Lankan economy from international capital markets.
This would be an independent barometer of the health of the Sri Lankan economy as international capital markets are hard-nosed in their assessments, the Central Bank said.
An International Sovereign Bond (ISB) amounting to US$ 2.5 bn (the largest ever) was successfully issued. It was 2.6 times over-subscribed. Large orders were placed by some of the worlds largest and most reputed investment funds.
With the receipt of ISB proceeds, gross official reserves have increased to US$ 9.9 billion which is historically the highest level.
There has been a very favourable response to the RFP for a term loan of USD 1 bn. The Government is considering up scaling this loan and to utilize the incremental proceeds to repay more expensive existing debts.
Despite outflows from emerging markets in the wake of normalization of US interest rates as well as synchronized growth in US, Europe and Japan for the first time since the Global Financial Crisis, there have been net cumulative inflows both to the stock market as well as the rupee denominated Government Securities market.
There have been foreign portfolio investments in equity, through primary and secondary market investment in the Colombo Stock Exchange to the tune of USD 9. 6 mn to-date in 2018. In 2017, inflows amounted to USD 278.5 mn.
Net inflows into the Government Securities market amounted to USD 6.05 mn so far this year. In 2017, net inflows amounted to USD 441 mn. FDI flows of USD 1.9 bn in 2017 were an all-time record, albeit from a low base.
In addition, staff-level agreement has been reached on the fourth Review of the IMF EFF, subject to Cabinet approval of the automatic fuel pricing formula. The fifth tranche of the IMF facility is expected in June 2018. After June 2017 the IMF has issued several positive statements regarding improving macroeconomic stability and outlook.Last year two ratings agencies namely S&P and Fitch changed the outlook to stable from negative.
The above reflects positive sentiment regarding the performance of the Sri Lankan economy and its prospects on the basis of independent assessments made by external parties who have backed this by inflows of their money in to the country.
It is imperative to build upon this by persisting with sound macroeconomic policies: fiscal consolidation, prudent monetary policies and a flexible exchange rate which supports the competitiveness of the economy. This should be supported by the acceleration of structural reforms to strengthen factor markets; improve the investment climate; boost investment promotion, introduce trade facilitation measures; and complete trade negotiations. Political stability is essential for sustained growth and development.

Ex-ministers to support Govts good deeds
Most Ven.Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake thera of the Malwatte Chapter said he believed that the 16 SLFP members who held Ministerial posts would remain in the government for the full length of its tenure.
The Prelate expressed these sentiments when the group of 16 SLFP members who resigned from government ranks called on him at his temple in Kandy to receive his blessings.
The SLFP members said that eventhough they would sit in the Opposition, they would support all good deeds of the government.
The Mahanayake said the UNP and the SLFP were two diametrically opposed parties and as such it was natural for problems to crop up when they served in a unity government.
SLFP Treasurer MP S. B.Dissanayake said they will remain with the President and the SLFP and try to prod the government on the correct track. Although they would sit in the opposition from May 8 they would strive to strengthen the SLFP and the UPFA under the chairmanship of President Maithripala Sirisena.
SLFP senior Vice President John Seneviratne said they held ministry posts in the unity government with the firm intention of doing some service to the country.
But unfortunate they could not bring about the change they expected. The country had fallen into dire straits in the economic, cultural and social officers during the immediate past and as such the SLFP would not be able to face the public if it continued to remain as a partner in the government.
Former ministers Anura Priyadarshana Yapa,Susil Premajayantha, Dayasiri Jayasekara, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane, Chandima Weerakkody and former Deputy Ministers Sumedha Jayasena, Dilan Perera, T. B. Ekanayake, Anuradha Jayaratne, Susantha Punchinilame, Lakshman Wasantha Perera and former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala were present.

Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake said the decision to lift the ban imposed three years ago had been taken after considering scientific research which proved that this substance is not harmful to human health.
Japan has rejected a stock of tea exported from Sri Lanka claiming that the stock contained chemical substances exceeding the default residue level imposed by them.Sri Lanka Tea Board sources this was due to the weedicides being widely used by planters as a substitute to Glyphosate.

All Provincial Councils come under the same government. It is the Governor who implements Presidents vision and powers at Provincial level.
He said that many areas in Colombo are inundated even after a minor rain as a result of reclamation of paddy fields. Accordingly, constructions will be permitted only on bare land. I hope to implement a systematic programme to protect the environment in the Western Province.

Govt signed SLSFTA without Cabinet approval - MP Wimal
National Freedom Front Leader Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa yesterday alleged that the government has signed the Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) between Sri Lanka and Singapore without Cabinet approval.
He was addressing the media yesterday at the NFF office in Pitakotte.
Sri Lanka and Singapore signed the Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (SLSFTA) on January 23, 2018 during the visit of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in Colombo.
MP Weerawansa further alleged that International trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema has misled the Cabinet of Ministers by making fake documents to sign this agreement.
There was no urgent need of signing such an agreement since Singapore does not impose special taxes on Sri Lankan exports. This agreement has been signed without informing the professionals and industrialists who will be directly affected from this agreement, said the MP.
He further said that the Cabinet Paper with this regard had been submitted to the Cabinet on January 9, 2018. Though this had been discussed during a Cabinet meeting, Cabinet of Ministers did not grant the approval.
He urged the government to withdraw this agreement and invited the professionals to come forward to fight against this agreement.

Hino 500 Series Dakar Rally Truck in Sri Lanka
Toyota Lanka (Private) Limited, the sole authorized distributor for Toyota and Hino vehicles in Sri Lanka is giving all its customers and racing fans in Sri Lanka a unique opportunity to see a Hino Rally Truck that successfully completed the Dakar Rally.
The Dakar Rally is recognized as the worlds toughest Rally Championship, held annually in South America since 1978. The race is a test of endurance of both the vehicle and its driver. The terrain that the drivers must navigate and overcome is much tougher than what conventional rally drivers are accustomed to and the vehicles used are true off-road vehicles rather than modified on-road vehicles.
The Hino 500 series truck is an annual contender in the Dakar Rally and has finished in all 27 Dakar Rallies since its first entry in 1991. Hino Motors became the very first Japanese truck manufacturer to enter the race. Hino Motors swept the overall Trucks category championship for the first time in the categorys history in 1997 and has won 18 Under-10-Litre class championships and is currently on a 9 year winning streak from 2010 through 2018.
Toyota Lanka is immensely proud of this rare opportunity that we have received to bring down the actual Hino 500 series truck that competed at the world renowned Dakar Rally. Our aim in bringing this vehicle to Sri Lanka and opening it for public viewing is to communicate the absolute brand power Hino commands on a global scale, said Toyota Lankas Managing Director Shungo Yoshioka.
The formal unveiling of this monster of a vehicle took place at the Toyota Lanka Head Office and thereafter will be on display for public viewing from the 23rd of February onwards. It will also embark on a journey across the island covering several major cities. Joining Toyota Lanka on this unique venture is Advantis, the Official Logistics Partner providing their equipment and expertise for the movement of this monster rally truck.
Toyota Lanka will utilize this opportunity as a unique brand building exercise to further cement its position as the exclusive distributor of Hino Trucks in Sri Lanka. It will also highlight and communicate to the Sri Lankan market, the many strengths inherent to the Hino brand.
Toyota Lankas COO/Director Manohara Atukorala also commented on this unique viewing saying, Toyota Lankas island-wide campaign will not just be a stand-alone brand building exercise. It will also be a platform to showcase the many functional benefits of our own Hino truck lineup to our target audience. The Hino 500 series rally truck does not vary all that much from the production version in terms of its chassis, engine and transmission, therefore Hinos Dakar Rally achievements vouch for its phenomenal engineering and reliability. Our road conditions are negligiblein comparison to the conditions faced at the rally, hence we are confident that this campaign will no doubt solidify Hinos reputation as a highly durable and reliable truck brand.

Inseparable bond
A little over a week ago Colombo experienced two great cultures joining hands. The Japan Expo Sri Lanka 2018 Exhibition was held at the BMICH recently. Japan is a resilient country and its culture is rich and diverse. It is fitting that such an exhibition should take place as both our peoples are resilient and have emerged from a period of darkness. Japan showed tremendous courage and rebuilt their country and economy after the Hiroshima Nagasaki bombings and Sri Lanka ended its civil war nearly a decade ago. Both countries were hit by devastating Tsunamis and have recovered. Therefore it is only natural that these two nations should join hands in a time of great political instability in other parts of our world. Perhaps this will serve as a reminder to all that ties of love are stronger than hate mongering.
Among the activities arranged were the Tea Ceremony, Ikebana, Sumo Wrestling and Japanese films.
The opening was attended by dignitaries who addressed the audience gathered and laid emphasis on the greatness of this event and its benefits.
Minister of Science, Technology and Research and Minister of Skills Development and Vocational Training Sarath Amunugama said that Sri Lanka and Japan have definitely been the best of friends even before the time we received independence.
Literacy rate
Sri Lankans have been very interested in Japan and Japanese have been very interested in Sri Lanka. At the time of independence, commentators said that the two countries that have the greatest potential to develop were Japan and Sri Lanka. Both had a very high literacy rate. Both had a democratic government and both had leaders who knew each other. At the San Francisco conference, J R Jayewardene represented Sri Lanka at the conference. We were the only country in the whole world that said publicly  We dont want one yen of reparation from Japan. Japan is a friendly country and a Buddhist country, and whatever happened in the war they remain our friends and we dont want any separation from them. That has been remembered in Japan and there is a statue of President J.R. Jayewardene, said Amunugama.
Whenever dignitaries from Sri Lanka visit Japan, Japanese leaders very gratefully recall the role played by President J.R. Jayewardene and the Sri Lankan government of that time.
So we have had very friendly relations. Many Sri Lankans have gone to Japan. Some have settled down there. Some have come back and begun enterprises here. So we have a growing relationship with Japan. This is a cultural event and it is very good that we emphasize the cultural relations between our two countries. We have a strong Buddhist background. But today I would like to mention something which is not normally referred to. And that is the role of Professor Sarachchandra who was a cultural icon in Sri Lanka and still is. All his cultural work  his plays, novels and poetry, all have been strongly influenced by Japan. He was in Japan for I think one and a half years on a scholarship. And our iconic play called Maname was strongly influenced by what he saw and read in Japan. He wrote one important novel - Malagiya Aththo. It deals with his experiences in Japan. Especially with a nice beautiful Japanese girl called Noriko. Today there are so many Sri Lankan girls called Noriko. So we must encourage scholars to study this relationship between Sri Lanka and Japan because Japanese culture has certainly influenced Sri Lankan theatre and literature apart from Sarathchandra. We have studied political and economic relationships but what about cultural relationships explained Amunugama.
History investigation
Amunugama also stated that there are so many areas that a lot of people do not know about. Areas that must be brought into the open. These areas need to be investigated because there is so much history between our two countries.
I think this should be a very important event in the Sri Lanka calendar for every year. It should not be confined to three days but at least should be one week! A lot of people should see it as it is something fantastic. We look forward to more and more Japanese tourists coming to Sri Lanka. The tourism board I understand is building golf courses all over the country because the top Japanese businessmen come and play golf! So here is to a long relationship, as we have never had problems with Japanese tourists. A lot of Sri Lankans are learning the language. When it comes to the economy I must say that Japanese products are of high quality. So I wish to congratulate the organizers of this event, said Amunugama.
Ambassador of Japan in Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma said it is undoubtedly a great joy for him to attend the 2nd Japan Expo Sri Lanka 2018 exhibition.
There will be so many Japanese Cultural activities such as Ikebana, Bonsai and Tea Ceremony. Also, there will be the introduction of new, young Japanese pop culture related activities and also traditional folk festivals. There will also be movies from Japan along with authentic Japanese food. This is by far the greatest exposition of the diversity of Japanese Culture in Sri Lanka. I wish to express my deep gratitude to all efforts taken by the organizers and the sponsors and associations in Sri Lanka involved in this. The relations between Sri Lanka and Japan have always been good. But we are now trying to make it even stronger. We have succeeded in increasing exchanges at the political level. Now we have more Japanese investment coming in. We have more Japanese tourists coming into Sri Lanka  hopefully more than 50,000 this year. That is a seven percent increase from last year, said Suganuma.
Strengthened relationship
He also stated that now there are more Sri Lankans going to Japan because of their interest in Japanese culture.
The prospects of strengthening our relationship is very good. This event is the ideal opportunity for those who are not familiar with Japanese culture to become knowledgeable about it. I hope everyone will enjoy the various aspects of Japanese Culture, said Suganuma
Executive Committee Chairman of Japan Expo Sri Lanka, Michiyo Furusawa, said that Sri Lanka and Japan have many things in common and that our relationship is indeed greatly valued by Japan.
We are both island countries and beautiful countries at that. We are both hospitable and kind to people. We are both friendly and welcoming. The Japan Expo Sri Lanka 2018 is a festival organized in the hope that it will broaden mutual understanding between our two countries and cement our friendship. We want the people of Sri Lanka to be exposed to Japanese culture and technology.
This time we have tried our best to bring to you the best of Japanese culture. We want you to have a good time and hope that you will enjoy. We are doing this in the hope that we will get to know each other well and understand each other deeply. This is something I firmly believe in  friendship. We will create a wonderful future for each other. We will improve our relationship, said Furusawa.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 23
Inspiring bosses lead from their hearts, invest their hearts in their people and let them grow
There has been a debate for years about what makes a leader. This debate has resulted in two schools of thought. One school proposes that leaders are made from a select few unique of individuals, born with a rare set of leadership abilities  leaders are born. The other school of thought proposes that leaders are made, that we learn, grow and develop into leaders  leaders are made.
Warren Bennis is an American university professor, organizational consultant and author, widely regarded as a pioneer of the contemporary field of Leadership studies. He spent a significant amount of time studying leaders and leadership. He also spent time on the faculties of Harvard and Boston University, an author of over 30 books and an adviser to four United States presidents. After as significant amount of research on leadership, he came to the following conclusion:
The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born  that there is a genetic factor to leadership. This myth asserts that people simply either have certain charismatic qualities or not. Thats nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.
The truth is that major capacities and competencies of leadership can be learned if the basic desire to learn them exists. It turns out that the vast majority of leaders are made through focused effort, hard work and daily action.
No one would say leadership is easy, but the rewards are great! In making the commitment to be a role model, to look positively at the future, to encourage his people to be the best that they can be and then thank them for their efforts, leaders are fostering not only their own development,but positively moving his people into the future.
Attributes
There are four attributes that compel people to follow a leader, includingthat the leader be honest, forward-looking, inspiring and competent. People who work with such leaders are significantly more satisfied, committed, energized,and productive.
Writing in in his book, Executive Excellence, Joseph Folkman reports on improving nine leadership behaviours has the greatest impact on employee satisfaction and commitment.
The following are those 9 behaviours.
1. Inspire and motivate others. Leaders who effectively inspire and motivate others have high energy and enthusiasm. They energize their team to achieve goals and increase performance.
2. Driving for results. The drive for results is vital; however, some leaders are all push (drive for results) and no pull (inspiration), which reduces motivation. A healthy balance is necessary.
3. Strategic perspective. Leaders who provide their team with a definite sense of direction and purpose have more satisfied and committed employees. These leaders paint a clear perspective between the overall picture and the details of day-to-day activities.
4. Collaboration. When leaders show that they can achieve objectives that require a high level of cooperation, they create synergy, and everyone enjoys the work more.
5. Walk the talk. Being honest and acting with integrity creates a more satisfied and committed workforce. Leaders need to be role models and set a good example.
6. Trust. Leaders engender trust by becoming aware of employee concerns, aspirations, and circumstances; projecting deep expertise, knowledge, and confidence in making informed decisions; being consistent and predictable; and exhibiting honesty and integrity.
7. Develops and supports others. When leaders help employees to develop new skills and abilities, employees have higher satisfaction and commitment, and become higher performers and more promotable. Effective leaders are thrilled by the success of others.
8. Building relationships. Leaders who stay in touch with employee concerns engender higher employee satisfaction and commitment. Such leaders balance getting results with a concern for others needs.
9. Courage. The leaders with the highest employee satisfaction and commitment are courageous. They dont shy away from conflicts. They deal with issues head-on; when they see the first signs of problems within their teams, they address it directly and candidly.
This is an excellent checklist for personal leadership development or to assess or review the skills of anyone on your team or in your organization that youre trying to develop to increase employee engagement.
Inspire and motivate
Today, we will take item (1)-Inspire and motivate others and study it in detail. We will discuss the balance in future instalments.
Effective leaders know how to motivate employees by motivating team members to want to do what needs to be done by effectively using these three motivational factors. (1) Appreciation,(2) Involvement and (3) Awareness of personal situations. Many people are surprised to discover that money is not one of the top three.
Motivation in the workplace is often linked to money, and with good reason. Getting a paycheck is one of the main reasons people go to work in the first place. But as far as a reason, or motive, for completing tasks, its not very high on the list.
Even if you inherit new team members from another department and you know nothing about the people youll be leading, you can tailor these three factors so they will motivate the entire team. This is how leaders create sustainable, high performing teams.
Now, lets take a look at the top motivational factor  appreciation which is the most powerful motivator. Though its the most powerful of the three factors, appreciation must be used appropriately; that old saying about too much of a good thing definitely applies here.
If an employee hears how great he is doing every day - no matter what quality of work hes turning out - this appreciation becomes meaningless to him. It comes across as a fake managerial tactic to coerce him to get the work done.
Words of praise dont work for everyone. In fact, they can turn some people off. The trick here is to know what each person will respond to, and make sure that they get it.
Appreciating people correctly
Lets take, what is known as bicycle analogy to see how a leader can utilize appreciation most effectively in correlation with communication priorities. The various Technical skills - engineering, accountancy, computers, trades etc. - that enable business owners to get started are what can be described as Rear Wheel skills. They are functional and drive the business along. It is necessary to be good at these and keep the processes - the chains, cogs and gears - well oiled.
Unfortunately, the possession of rear wheel skill is only half of what is needed. In order to expand and develop the business the owner manager also requires effective Front Wheel skills. These are the more personal human skills - communication, interpersonal and analytical. For a business to grow it needs the owner manager or managers to effectively communicate its rear wheel skills to customers. Sales and marketing is more about front wheel than rear wheel skills.
Back wheel communicators need recognition to be very tangible, in the forms of accomplishments, tasks completed or goals achieved. Front wheel communicators need recognition to be intangible - that is, touchy-feely, emotional and expressive.
Now, lets add in communication pace:
Faster-paced, back wheel communicators are motivated by public, tangible appreciation. These team members tend to have large houses and luxury cars. Their offices commonly have the walls full of plaques and awards. Publicly given, tangible signs of appreciation keep them motivated because they like having something that they and others can see.
Faster-paced, front wheel communicators are motivated by one-minute praise sessions. Intangible terms like wonderful work, fabulous improvement and outstanding job motivate these team members. They are likely to not only show you their letters of praise from clients, but ask you to read them aloud, and to post them on the department bulletin board as well. To them, public praise is an instant turn off. Meet with these team members one-on-one to communicate with them and use phrases such as the team and the contributions your team has made.
Short advices to bring inspiration:
Find out what they need. Be respectful, Stop micromanaging. Lead by example, Be personable, Stress your companys purpose, Do what you say, Be decisive, Show emotions, Push their limits, Admit when you dont have the answer, Dont impose fear, Develop future leaders from within, Encourage personal growth, Help overcome weakness, Hold your team accountable, Ask a lot of questions, Demonstrate knowledge, Be flexible, Understand your purpose, Welcome involvement, Get to know your team, Be transparent, Hold brainstorming sessions, Be accessible.
Human capital
Drawing insight from Eastern philosophy, we can conclude like this: If we want to change the way of being, we have to change the way of doing. This strikes us as profound in the moment and even more profound over time  and the sentiment matches what we learned in our study. Leaders can only change by doing things differently. The more often they behave in a new way, the sooner they become a new type of leader, an inspirational leader. We know that individual inspiration is the gateway to employee discretionary energy, and that, in turn, is critical to making the most of your scarcest resource  your human capital
Valuing inspiration throughout an organization teaches everyone to be more aware, reflective, and empathetic. Ultimately, a team that reinforces the core principles of inspiration will have a competitive edge, and a more productive and resilient future.

Intl film studies centre to honour Lester - President
The nation is in mourning for a great man who shaped an era, said President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday as he addressed the state funeral of late Dr Lester James Peries yesterday.
I spoke to Dr. Lester James Peries last when I visited his house on his birthday two weeks ago. He was a man who succeeded in portraying Sinhalese culture, society and the rural landscape of the country to the world through cinema, the President said.
He added that whilst it was the norm for people to be known by their country, Sri Lanka came to be known through Dr. Peries.
As a government we decided to have his final rites with state honours and declare today a day of mourning as an honour to his vision and humanitarianism.
The President further said that the great artiste was a pioneer in teaching both local and international cinema ways of connecting the environment to the people.
As he expressed the governments and the nations sympathies to Dr Peries wife and family, he asked that all in the field of local cinema come together to build on the vision and intelligence of the late Dr Peries to take Sri Lankan cinema forward. The President also heeded to the request made by Prof. Sunil Ariyaratne to help build an international film studies centre dedicated to the late veteran.
He added that while it was the norm for people to be known by their country, Sri Lanka came to be known through Dr Peries .

Japanese startup plans Lankas first electric vehicle plant
Opening a new chapter in Sri Lankan automotive industry, a Tokyo based high-tech research and development startup is planning Sri Lankas first ever large, industry scale electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing facility.
The startup from Tokyo is also setting up international standard EV charging systems known as micro-grid stations across the country, as part of their hi-tech transfer to Sri Lanka. A top Japanese investment team consisting of key executives of Tokyos Future Science Research Inc (FSRI), along with high ranking former Japanese officials is now in town for the projects initial groundwork. The proposed EV manufacturing operation is to take off by producing Sri Lankas first ever smart, EV tuk-tuks.
We are not coming to Sri Lanka because of the availability of resources -such as cheap labour. If that is the case we can go to some other destination where the resources are available even cheaper stressed the Chairman of Tokyo based Future Science Research Inc (FSRI) Akihito Matsumura on May 1 in Colombo. FSRIs Matsumura , who is leading a delegation consisting executives of his company and several former Japanese technocrats. He expressed these views at a meeting with Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bthiudeen.
FSRIs Matsumura added that his teams arrival in Colombo is also due to the favorable impressions he received about Sri Lanka from President Maithripala Sirisenas recent visit to Japan.
Minister Bathiudeen, responding to FSRIs Matsumura welcomed their plans to launch this new project in Sri Lanka. This new venture is innovative and Sri Lanka is in fact honored to have it here. It will be a great step forward for Sri Lankas automotive sector and will involve both the BoI and my Ministry. I and my officials will extend our fullest cooperation to get this off the ground. Already 85 Japanese FDI projects are here employing 10,000 Sri Lankans. Chairman Matsumura and his team did not reveal any details of their planned investment values in the proposed EV initiative.
In the 10 year period of 2007-2017, Sri Lanka received Japanese FDI investments totalling $ 273 Mn. There are 85 Japanese private sector projects in operation in Sri Lanka at present. Among the sectors of Japanese investments here are semiconductors, printed circuit boards, safety sensors, ceramic items, cement, apparel, building and repairing of ships, power and tourism, infrastructure, and logistics.

Sri Lanka opener Dimuth Karunaratne is in doubt for Sri Lankas three-Test tour of the Caribbean after suffering a fracture on his index finger of his left hand at practice.
An X-ray has confirmed a fracture which is certain to rule him out for at least a few weeks.
If the fracture requires surgery - a decision that will be taken over the next 24 hours - he will almost certainly be out until July. The three Tests against West Indies are scheduled for June.
The left-handed Test opener sustained the injury while batting in the nets in preparation for Sri Lanka's Super Provincial one-day tournament that began yesterday.

Keeping our microbes in good shape
Do we ever think who we are from a view of a scientist We wake up, go to jobs or for studies, eat, drink, wash, sleepetc. Normally we are busy in our day today lives. We live in this macro-world, and when we are diseased, we get medicines to be cured. We dont care how the disease was caused instead we forget everything after we have been cured.
A scientists especially microbiologists does all above activities with millions to billions friends within and around him. These friends are the microorganisms, but they are not friends at all the times. If a man is rich and wealthy, everybody get close to him to get benefits, but if he is in a bad situation, all will leave. Thats the real behaviour of humans. Likewise, some microbes behave as friends when the man is in a good health, but soon become enemies when man is not good in health, but some are actual friends in their whole lifetime.
Lets move onto our topic Human-Micro biome, we are all humans, and Micro means related to microbes which we cannot see with our naked eyes. Biome means a habitat where organisms can occur naturally. Human Micro biome is the collection of microbes that colonize the human body. Some scientists say, it is a newly discovered organ of our body, and some say it is an ecosystem. The main hotspots of micro biome in our body are, nasal cavity, oral cavity, skin, gastro-intestinal tract and urogenital tract, but even healthy individuals differ remarkably in diversity of microbes that occupy habitats in each body. Each area is dependent upon beneficial species. For an example, the gut microbes which inhabit in intestinal tracts mucus lining, provide a protective barrier that guard intestinal wall against pathogenic bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and some toxins. These microbes also create antimicrobial substances which are powerful, natural antibacterial, anti-fungal and antiviral that destroys pathogenic organisms.
Although these microbes are beneficial, sometimes they cause infections when the peaceful relationship with human becomes altered. For an example, gut bacteria are necessary for maintaining intestinal walls health, because bacteria send signals to intestinal cells to secrete mucus and sometimes to secrete bacteria-killing molecules, but if the mucus layer gets thinner and bacteria get close to the gut wall, an immune reaction will be triggered. If more close to gut wall, inflammation becomes chronic, so it may harm our body. Therefore these organisms are beneficial as well as detrimental.
The microbiome is a complete, dynamic, ever-changing ecology, with genetic variations according to which niche in the body is being populated. For an example, on the skin alone, each bodily area has a different local microbiome, actually microhabitats. As microbes are very small, we should think small. For an example, when a typical microorganism of 3m in length travels a distance of 3mm, it is like 2km for a human. Even more across that 3mm distance numerous chemical and physiological differences may exist that may greatly affect microbes.
Imbalance of microbiome seems to be implicated in a wide range of disorders. For example; Low diversity in the gut leads to obesity and inflammatory bowel disease, and high diversity in the vagina leads to bacterial Vaginosis. Likewise some disorders are directly linked to microbial diversity. Here diversity means the number and abundance in distribution of microbes in human body.
If we use antibiotics to cure a disease, the gut microbial diversity get decreased up to some extent immediately, then there wont be sufficient bacteria to digest food parts into small molecules which provide us energy. Then malnutrition can occur. Poor balance of gut microbes is associated with every digestive tract disorders as well as auto-immune conditions and psychological and behavioral issues.
Some of above mentioned facts and many more revelations began with development of the project, called Human Microbiome Project (HMP). With the modern technology, called Genome sequencing, this HMP targeted to find out the exact diversity and exact relationship between humans and microbes which inhabit within human body. It revealed the diversity and abundance of each habitats signature microbes to vary widely, with strong niche specialization both within and among individuals.
The main five hotspots were mentioned previously, and HMP analyzes every micro-habitats diversity within those 5 hotspots. HMP uses several techniques to sequence. Firstly it collects samples, and controls the quality. After these samples are used for 16s rRNA gene analysis via 454-Pyrosequencing method. To assess functions, it uses Paired-end illumina shotgun metagenomic sequencing method. These analyses are based on two diversities, Alpha (a) (within sample) and Beta () (samples from the same habitat among subjects). These findings led us to totally different ways to study and deal with microbes. Those microbes are a part of our body and our human genome determines the compositions of our Microbiome. So, this may pave the way for further identification of individuals such as DNA fingerprinting, and will become a better source.

Proving expensive equipment and fine golf courses not essentials:
Killinochchi Academy wins inaugural Inter-Academy Novices Golf Title
Killinochchi Academy emerged winners of the inaugural SLGU Inter-Academy Novices Golf Tournament conducted by the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU) at the Eagles Heritage Golf Club in Anuradhapura recently. By winning the inaugural title Killinochchi Academy provided true testimony to the facts that one does not need to have expensive equipment and well maintained golf courses to start golf and the golfing talent in Sri Lanka is just waiting to be discovered and nurtured.
Twenty three junior golfers took to the field to compete in the inaugural SLGU Inter-Academy Novices Golf Tournament as part of SLGU's program led by its President Priath Fernando to unite the country through golf. The tournament was possible after the 'HSBC Future Lions' program initiated in conjunction with HSBC in September, 2017 by moving to the next phase of testing the competitive skills of kids who had never before played in a tournament.
The first phase was to train and certify Level 2 instructors using the services of Anil Perera, a Class A Professional, PGTCA USA. These instructors were then used to train the potential kids who were selected after the initial talent spotting 'HSBC Future Lions' program. Whilst, the Colombo and Welisara kids practiced at the Navy Aqua Range in Welisara, the Anuradhapura kids practiced at the SLAF Eagles Heritage Golf Course in Anuradhapura. The least facilitated group of kids, the Killinochchi Academy could only use their school grounds to sharpen their skills.
Commenting on the programme, Mark Prothero  Chief Executive Officer: HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives said: The HSBC Future Lions Junior Golf grass root programme attracted over 300 children in its inaugural year. We are hugely encouraged with its outcome and our congratulations to the junior golfers from Killinochi on their victory at this inaugural event. HSBC as a global supporter of the game is delighted to support SLGU in its endeavor to engage more junior golfers and provide an opportunity for players from across Sri Lanka to experience the sport and more importantly enjoy it. We look forward to the HSBC Future Lions programme in 2018 .
Up to a maximum of eight kids from ages 12 to 17 from each Academy were hand-picked by the instructors to represent their Golf Academies after training just 1-2 hours per week over a five month period. The results were better than expected with some kids making pars and one even making a birdie with the best score of 50 for 9 holes by the overall individual winner, Thanuja Kalhara from Anuradhapura. Priya Hemantha, head instructor of Kilinochchi was awarded as the Best Instructor for producing the winning team.
If I had to point out to one thing apart from the golf swing, it would be the enthusiasm and focus from these players said Anil Perera, Golf Development Consultant of the Sri Lanka Golf Union.
Whilst there were no corporate sponsors for this event, the cost has been met by donations through a fund raiser organized by Sri Lankas top golf professionals called 'Pros give back', in appreciation for the support that they were given by the SLGU to become top amateurs before they turned professional.

Lanka sends two green anacondas to India
The Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens welcomed a male and a female green anaconda from the Sri Lanka National Zoo on Sunday under the animal exchange programme after a gap of six years.
C Ravishankar, Director of the Mysuru Zoo, said, The reptiles aged about four years were flown in from Sri Lanka to Bengaluru on the night of April 28 and reached their enclosure at the Mysuru Zoo in the early hours of April 29. They have been housed at the quarantine enclosure at the zoo.
He said, The length of the reptiles is about 6 to 8 feet and they weigh about 15 kilograms. Their condition is stable. They were transported under constant supervision from the zoo veterinarians and animal keepers. Five green anacondas were last received from the same zoo in 2011 and after an interim of six years, for the second time, we will be receiving six anacondas from the Sri Lankan zoo after obtaining approval from the Zoo Authority of India. Under the exchange programme, the Mysuru Zoo will be sending four black bucks and four nilgais to the Sri Lankan zoo, said the director.

Lester broke away from norm to produce great cinema - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the state funeral of Dr. Lester James Peries, paid tribute to his perseverance in breaking away from the norm to produce great cinema for Sri Lanka and the world over.
In a time where local cinema was filled with remakes of Indian cinema, it was Dr Lester James Peries who decided to break away from the norm and produce Rekhawa, said the Prime Minister, speaking at Independence Square.
When Rekhawa was shown many said the film was over and that he would revert to the norm but he did not give up. He directed six more in the 1960s. Between 1960-1980 he directed 14 films.
We are thankful to him for that. If he did not have that strength to persevere we would not have had Sinhalese or Sri Lankan cinema, he said.
Recalling fond memories of his time with the late Dr. Peries, the Prime Minister noted that having grown up with his movies, one of the last members of his parents era had passed away.
I met him at his residence on his birthday recently. I was surprised at his memory and he gave me a painting done by his brother Ivan Peries.
He further noted that Dr. Peries also had a record for turning novels in films with many of his films being sourced from them.
My deepest sympathies to Sumithra and her family,the Prime Minister said.
Dr. Peries was 99 at the time of passing.

Marriage (re)made in heaven!
The new Cabinet of the Yahapaalanaya government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was sworn in on May Day after a great deal of political manoeuvring and introspection from within both the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP).
The Cabinet is dominated by the UNP, given that the number of SLFP parliamentarians loyal to President Sirisena has dwindled to twenty-five with sixteen SLFP ministers and MPs leaving the government following the unsuccessful motion of no-confidence against Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
There were significant changes in some portfolios, with some of them even changing between the SLFP and the UNP, but there were no major surprises. The only newcomer to the Cabinet was Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe being in sworn in as Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs. Rajapakshe had earlier quit as Minister of Justice after the UNP demanded his resignation. As such, there was no one receiving a Cabinet portfolio for the first time. At the time of writing, appointments to deputy minister and state minister posts were yet to be made.
Much-anticipated appointments
Two portfolios held by the SLFP previously were hand over to the UNP. The Ministry of Social Empowerment and Social Welfare was divided between P. Harrison (Social Empowerment) and Daya Gamage (Social Welfare). Gamage is also responsible for Primary Industries. Ravindra Samaraweera was appointed as the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations, also previously held by the SLFP.
Some of the much-anticipated appointments did not materialise. Although there was a request from the UNP to appoint Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as Minister of Law and Order, Ranjith Madduma retained that Ministry. President Sirisena has also resisted a request by the UNP to reappoint Ravi Karunanayake to the Cabinet.
The lead up to the reshuffle was not without its share of drama, both in the SLFP and the SLFP. In the SLFP, President Sirisena was under pressure to allow the party to leave the government. In the UNP, the Premier was under scrutiny for the reforms he was undertaking within the party.
At the SLFPs last Central Committee some SLFP parliamentarians wanted a vote on whether the party should continue in a coalition with the UNP. However, President Sirisena who was presiding decided that such a move would be counterproductive in that it could aggravate the divisions within the party.
There were also suggestions that posts held by party officials should be reviewed. Many interpreted this to be a move against the general secretaries of the SLFP and the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), Duminda Dissanayake and Mahinda Amaraweera.
It will be recalled that at the last general elections in 2015, President Sirisena ran into some strife with the then general secretaries of the SLFP and UPFA, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa and Susil Premajayantha. Soon after the polls, he replaced them with Dissanayake and Amaraweera. Last week, there were calls for these appointments to be reviewed but the President did not respond favourably to the suggestion.
Instead, the President proposed a reorganisation of the SLFP and said this will be undertaken after the new session of Parliament is inaugurated next Tuesday. Significantly, it is during this session that the sixteen SLFPers who voted for the motion of no-confidence against the Prime Minister are due to sit on the opposition benches.
Meaningful reforms
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe too had to navigate through some stormy weather in his own party, the UNP, where he had promised meaningful reforms, firstly in the aftermath of the February 10 local government elections and secondly following the motion of no-confidence against him.
Several committees had been appointed to study reforms in the party and these committees had presented their recommendations. A twelve member Politburo was also appointed, tasked with taking overarching policy decisions as it was felt that this was beyond the unwieldy Working Committee.
Despite these efforts, there were two issues that created unease within the party. They related to the retention of Ravi Karunanayake as Assistant Leader of the party and the appointment of Akila Viraj Kariyawasam as general secretary.
Karunanayake has been under a cloud recently, even since he was implicated by association in the Central Bank bond sale controversy. His portfolio was changed from Finance to Foreign Affairs in May 2017 because of this.
Subsequent evidence led before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the bond sale revealed that Karunanayakes rented apartment had been paid for by Arjuna Aloysius, the son-in-law of former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran and a key person of interest in the inquiry. Following this revelation, Karunanayake resigned from the Cabinet in August 2017, albeit protesting his innocence.
Minister and Former Attorney General Tilak Marapana were asked by the UNP leadership to inquire into what steps need to be taken regarding Karunanayake. Marapana recommended that Karunanayake should refrain from discharging his duties as Assistant Leader of the UNP until finality is reached in respect of the legal issues related to the findings of the Commission of Inquiry.
It is against such a backdrop that Karunanayakes continuation as Assistant Leader was opposed. Although many opposed the appointment, two stalwarts spoke out: Former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera and Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake.
Though not currently a parliamentarian, Perera is a party elder, having entered Parliament in 1976 at the Ja-Ela by-election, even before Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and is therefore much respected. Perera stormed out of the Working Committee meeting stating he cannot agree to Karunanayakes appointment and subsequently tendered his resignation from the Working Committee. Similarly, there was some discontent about Kariyawasams appointment which was due to two schools of thought about the role of the general secretary. The Ruwan Wijewardene Committee which studied party reforms had recommended that the post of general secretary should be a person who is not an active politician and hence able to devote his entire time to the party.
Indeed, this had been the practice during the J. R. Jayewardene era of the UNP and the name of Imtiaz Bakeer Markar had been proposed for the post. Markar, a former parliamentarian and fluent in all three languages, was a popular choice among the parliamentary group.
Comments on party leadership
However, there was a different view that the general secretary should be an appointment made by the party leader to avoid potential conflict. The SLFPs experience in 2015 was cited as a case in point. Eventually, Kariyawasams appointment was accepted but it wasnt a unanimous choice.
Some, such as Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera, in fact, spoke out against the party leadership publicly. Perera was critical of the reforms and stated that they do not meet the aspirations of the majority of party members. Other UNPers have however opted to discuss their grievances in private.
While there is an appreciation that party reforms would never please all factions in the UNP, it is left to be seen whether the UNP will now stand united with a view to taking on its electoral challenges- or whether the reforms will lead to further discontent and unrest.
The next step for the new Cabinet sworn in on Tuesday is to consolidate its agenda. It is no secret that the UNP and SLFP have been at cross purposes for the past three years even though they were part and parcel of the same government. The President and the Prime Minister are keen that this rivalry is replaced by a common agenda.
Minister Sarath Amunugama has been entrusted with the task of formulating such an agenda. What will follow in the next two years is virtually the second innings of the Yahapaalanaya government. The UNP and the SLFP hope it will be better than the first- and no doubt the country will watch them with interest.

One year later...:
Meethotamulla residents pine for lost homes
D.S. Rasikas house was among those which were enveloped by the massive mountain of garbage when the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed exactly a year ago. Even though she was given a flat by the government soon after the collapse, she still wishes that the tragedy had not happened and that she could live with her family in their own house in Meethotamulla.
Living in a flat is not similar to the life we lived before, she said. There is a huge difference. We led a more peaceful life there.
It is one year since the Meethotamulla garbage dump tragedy. The survivors and the residents of the area claimed that not even a handful of garbage from the dump has been removed. All of them  those who have been given flats and others who are yet to receive compensation according to their land value - live with the blind hope that the government would clear the garbage dump and settle them in their own lands.
On the eve of New Year celebrations last year (April 14), the garbage dump in Meethotamulla, Kolonnawa, collapsed claiming more than 30 lives. According to the Disaster Management Ministry, more than 100 houses were completely destroyed and nearly 150 families were evicted from the area which was declared as a danger zone by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO).
The Peoples Movement Against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump revealed that even thoughthe government provided flats, around 63 families who refused to move into flats were living in rented houses in other areas.
Voice of the people
When interviewed by the Daily News, a resident of the area K. Sandun said the amount paid by the government as compensation to those who were affected was insufficient.
He claimed that the assessments were not done fairly and added that for some, receiving flats was more profitable compared to the house they had before, but for others it was unfair.
He said that the government should have done a proper assessment and given compensation according to the land value.
In the meantime, M. Piyasena said that he refused to move to the flats, but he was satisfied with the governments approach to the problem and he was happy with the compensation payment provided by the government.
He further said that these housing units provided to the shanty dwellers were already dirty and the government should ensure that they take care of these premises and keep them clean.
However, M.G. Siriyawathi said that the compensation paid for their properties was not enough to either build a new house or purchase one.
She said she did not feel as if she belonged to this place any more.
Siriyawathi pointing her finger at her house said it had not collapsed, but had been declared as a danger zone, and for the past one year she and her family have been living in a rented house.
We were asked to leave our house soon after the collapse, she said. The government gave us rent for four months, but they are yet to give the rent for the last six months.
She said the full amount was given by the district secretariat to the people who had deeds and she added that they too had title deeds for their property.
Therefore, we were asked to bring a letter to the district office, she said. They informed us that they have got the order to give the money and needed a letter to pass it.
Thereafter, Siriyawathi was given Rs. 1.35 million as compensation, but she has found that this was insufficient for them to buy a new house.
If the government asks us to go to our houses, we are ready to go, she said. We would like that to happen.
K. Ramanayake was asked to vacate within days of the disaster as the authorities feared a further collapse of the dump.
We requested the government to at least give us the land value or we would not have a future, he said.
Ramanayake lives in a rented house in Nagahamulla now and lamented about the difficulties in finding a proper school for his children.
Even though Rasika is living with her husband and two children in the flats, she feels that they are trapped inside a building.
We could not save any of our belongings, we earned all back with great difficulties, she said. We got this apartment and Rs. 2.5 million and the officials told us that this apartment was worth Rs. 4.5 million.
Rasika explained that not all have managed to thrive in their new living spaces in the apartments and that some have left their apartments, while others have given it out on rent.
We would like to go back to our village, she said. We are waiting for something to happen. If the government removes the garbage dump and cleans the surrounding area and gives it to us, we are ready to go back to our lands.
Immediate measures taken
Immediately after the collapse of the garbage dump, President Maithripala Sirisena appointed a one-member committee - former Judge Chandradasa Nanayakkara - to inquire into the causes that led to the Meethotamulla tragedy. A comprehensive report on the damage caused to life and property due to the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump was handed over to the President in February 2018.
The Colombo Municipal Council Commissioner V.K. Anura was removed from his position by Governor K.C. Logeswaran on March 2, based on the recommendations of the committee. The decision was made by the Governor after receiving instructions from the President to take appropriate action according to the report.
Short-term and long-term recommendations regarding the disposal of waste at Meethotamulla were included in the committee report, with the report pointing out the importance of establishing a central institution to manage the process of waste disposal in the Western Province.
The report also highlighted the importance of establishing garbage incinerators and the President said that he will give instructions in the future to the relevant ministries and institutions to implement the recommendations and proposals of the committee report.
The report further revealed that the cause for the tragedy included the fact that the CMC from its initial stages failed to follow a proper method for the purpose of waste disposal and failed to properly implement the proposals suggested in this regard.
Compensation for victims
The people affected complained that no measures were taken to value the lands of both properties over which the garbage collapsed and properties in the danger zone.
In the meantime, Piyasena said that the main issue was the continued delay in getting compensation for their lands.
He said that it was governments carelessness and irresponsibility that led to the disaster.
It is more correct to say that it was the government that let this disaster happen, he said. We were already struggling to lead a peaceful life and the disaster added to our plight.
National Disaster Relief Service Centre Director Chaminda Pathiraja said that compensation given to the people differs according to the damage caused.
He said that 170 families moved to the flats and 60 families live on rent.
The families living on rent are given rent allowances since May last year, he said.
Pathiraja said that the Valuation Department is currently doing the valuation for the lands and said that they will hand it over in the coming weeks.
There was a meeting with Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya on April 19 and the Valuation Department said that they would present the report in three weeks, he said. But I think there is a slight delay due to the New Year and Vesak holidays. They will present it soon.
Ramanayake claimed that the rent allowance given to the people was stopped last August and the representatives of the Movement Against the Meethotamulla Garbage Dump intervened and the Cabinet proposal to pay the allowance to the families was approved for a further six months.
Pathiraja, in response, said that the rent allowance from September 2017 to February 2018 has been paid. He assured that once the land valuation report is completed, the problem would be solved.
After the compensation for land value is paid, the lands will legally belong to the Urban Development Authority, which the government is expecting to do within the next few months.
In the meantime, Kolonnawa Urban Council member Saliya Wickremasinghe claimed that the government has not taken any initiatives to remove the garbage from that area.
They somehow managed to remove the people from that area and they are taking initiatives to pay them compensation, he said. I am not very well aware of the progress, but I am also concerned about the environment.
He further insisted that land valuation should be done.
Around 22 acres is covered by garbage, he said. The government has been talking about projects, but I do not see anything happening.
Urban Development Authority (UDA) Director General Sumedha Ratnayake, speaking to the Daily News, said that the government had decided to take over the land and convert it to an urban park.
He said that even though the first phase of the landfill site in Aruwakkalu was completed, it was only going to provide a long-term solution to Colombos waste disposal and not deal with the existing garbage dump at Meethotamulla.
If we are to transport the garbage in Meethotamulla, it is going to cost a lot, he said. Therefore, we have decided not to go for that option.
Ratnayake explained that a conceptual design on establishing an urban park was done by the Moratuwa University and it would be implemented with the support of the National Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLR and DC), National Building Research Organization, and the Sri Lanka Army.
Kolonnawa Urban Council is left without a place to dump garbage
The Meethotamulla garbage dump at the start was a small scale garbage dump for just the Mulleriyawa and Kolonnawa Urban Councils. Following the shifting of the Bloemendhal garbage dump, garbage collected from the CMC was also dumped at the Meethotamulla garbage dump.
According to Kolonnawa Urban Council Chairman Gupthila Silva, they do not have a place to dump garbage from Kolonnawa now.
The Colombo garbage issue was only raised after the collapse of the Meethotamulla dump, he said. Until then, even though there were internal issues and people protested, nothing happened, he said.
Silva claimed that in 1996 the land which belonged to the Kolonnawa Urban Council was taken over by the UDA. The land was initially used by the council to dump the garbage from Kolonnawa and its suburbs, but with the support of the UDA, the CMC had forcefully begun dumping garbage in that land in 2009.
Today after the collapse, every other urban council has a place to dump their garbage except for the Kolonnawa urban Council, he said. We are not allowed to dump in Dompe or Karadiyana.
Silva further explained that the people living in the areas belonging to Kolonnawa UC were low-income families and the garbage often was not segregated.
According to Silva, only segregated garbage could be sent to Muthurajawala, but the garbage collected from their council was mostly mixed, and thus they needed a separate place to segregate them.
Even the CMC has been given a place to dump mixed garbage, but not us. We are meeting the subject minister this week to discuss the prevailing issues regarding garbage, said Silva as he struggled to balance interests, both the local and national.

Memories of Bradby Shield
The Bradby Shield encounter popularly called The Bradby is the highlight of the school rugby calendar. It is played annually between traditional rivals Royal College and Trinity College. The 2nd leg is on Saturday in Pallekele. Royal and Trinity were among the first schools to take up the sport and continued meeting since they first met in July 1920. From this game it was a yearly encounter, with Trinity College winning the first 21 games. Royals first win came in 1941.
In 1945, the principal of Royal College, Edward Lawrence Bradby, put forward the idea of a trophy, to which the principal of Trinity College C.E. Simithraaratchy gave the fullest backing. Royal College principal offered a wooden shield designed and made by Kandyan silversmiths. It is a wooden disk decorated with intricate traditional Kandyan silver works. The agreement was , the shield should be presented to the winning teams captain soon after the final whistle of the 2nd leg. Today the under 18 game is played for the C.E. Simithraaratchy Cup, which was donated by an old boy called George Hemachandra. Thus the two principals who went all out for the Bradby have two trophies named in their memory.
This years first leg of the 74th Bradby played on 21 April saw Royal come up with an excellent overall performance to outplay Trinity by 39 points to 7. This game was also a league game which meant that the Royalists remain unbeaten in the league so far and top their group. The under 18 game also went in favor of Royal.
The first Bradby game was in 1945 when Royal led by C.D.L. Fernando beat Trinity led by Robert Sourjah 3-0 in the first leg in Colombo. However in the game played in Kandy the Trinitians managed to win 6-0 under S.B. Pilapitya and clinched the shield in the inaugural year on the basis of aggregate.
Royals first win in the Bradby came in 1948 under the captaincy of Ashroff Ashey Cader, Royal with four freshers won both legs- 6/3 and 8/6.
From 1952 to 1957 Trinity recorded six consecutive wins. In 1956 it was regarded as the Golden Year of Trinity rugby. They beat Royal in both legs 15-0 and 11-0. Nine members of that Trinity team played for Sri Lanka - Frank David, Rodney Frank, Nimal Maralande, Rajiv de Silva, Sena de Silva, Gamini Weerasinghe, Mike de Alwis, Ken de Joodt and Franklyn Jacobs. The side was coached by Bertie Dias.
In 1958 Royal led by Lorensz Perera who sprang from one wing to the other to collect a Trinity kick to touch and ran 75 yards to score the match winning try regained the Bradby after a lapse of six years.
The return match in 1964 at Nittawela will long be remembered for one of the most remarkable drop goal kicking ever seen in a rugby match in Sri Lanka with Royals Lakdasa Dissanayake executing three drop goals and another drop kick to convert a try - over 40 yards out, which enabled Royal to win the Bradby after two years. He contributed 11 points out of Royals 14.
In 1971 Fred Pereiras Royalists recorded the highest score for the series up to that time when they beat Trinity 22 points to 3, only one game was played due to JVP insurgency in the country.

The highest sequence of wins in this series is six by Trinity, between 1952 and 1957. Royal won the Shield four years back to back from 2001-2004. Today the tally is Trinity 39 wins, Royal 32 and 2 tied.

Money laundering case against Mahindananda: Further trial fixed for May 9
A case filed against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house valued at Rs.27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7, over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money, was yesterday taken up for further trial by the Colombo High Court.
Testifying before the Colombo High Court, the Treasurer of a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress, affirmed in Court that he took measures to transfer the trade unions funds amounting to Rs.2.9 million among three individuals, including former Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
At a previous occasion, witness Douglas Kahawage informed Court that former Minister Aluthgamage was functioning as the President of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress and that he had made a request that a loan be granted amounting to Rs.2.9 million.
The witness said the funds were subsequently remitted to three bank accounts belonging to former Minister Aluthgamage, his security officer and a personnel staff member to the tune of Rs.1.4 million, Rs 1 million and Rs.500,000 respectively.
The case was fixed for further trial on May 9 by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
Court was informed that Aluthgamage had filed a transfer case in the Court of Appeal seeking an order transferring this case to any other court other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga. This transfer application is to be taken up before the Court of Appeal on April 5.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Mahindananda Aluthgamage, alleging that Aluthgamage had purchased a house at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7 from an individual named Christopher Roshan for Rs. 27 million. The Attorney General alleged that the accused has failed to disclose how he was able to raise the money for the purchase of the house and further alleged that he had committed an offence that comes under Section 3 and 4 of the the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.
The former Minister stands accused of financial irregularities in a complaint lodged against him by the Convener of the Voice Against Corruption Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.
Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty with Counsel Hafeel Farisz appeared for the accused.

Moon asks U.N. to verify closure of Norths test site
UN: South Korean President Moon Jae-in has asked the United Nations to verify the planned closure of North Koreas nuclear test site, a UN spokesman said on Tuesday.
Moon made the request in a phone call to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, a few days after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un told the South Korean leader he planned to shut down the test site in May.
The president sought the support of the United Nations to verify the imminent closure of the DPRKs nuclear test site, as announced by the DPRK Chairman Kim Jong Un, said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric. The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK) is North Koreas official name.
Moon also asked for UN support to transform the demilitarized zone into a peace zone between the two Koreas, he added. Guterres said the United Nations was ready to discuss possible forms of support, but no details were provided.
The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UNs global nuclear watchdog, has the expertise to carry out verification missions.
Kim told Moon during the summit on Friday that he planned to dismantle the Punggye-ri nuclear test site as the leaders pledged to pursue a permanent peace treaty and denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
The Security Council has imposed tough economic sanctions on North Korea after Pyongyang last year carried out a sixth nuclear test and a series of advanced missile launches. Guterres on Friday applauded the truly historic summit between the Korean leaders and urged them to quickly turn their commitments into action. - AFP

Mr and Mrs Public Servant are you awake
Population projections indicate that by 2031, 21.9% of the population of Sri Lanka will be over the age of 60. Sri Lanka is thus expected to be the first low per-capita income country to enter into this global phenomenon. With the aged dependency set to rise from 13.5 in1991 to 36.0 in 2031, the financial burden will fall on the working age population. In other words, 6 workers supported one aged person in 2001, but 3 will have to support one elder in 2031.
Moreover, the elderly population in rural areas is five times the elderly population in urban areas. Therefore, with low household incomes associated with rural households, their burden will be felt more.
Seniors are susceptible to (i) Functional Decline that reduces our mobility, strength, balance, agility, leading toward increasingly levels of frailty, (ii) Age-related Disease including dementia, cardiovascular disease, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancer, strokes, age-related macular degeneration (AMD or ARMD), and glaucoma and (iii) Nonphysical challenges -Vulnerability- from home and society, Mental breakdown. It requires  (i) Age-related Adaptation: As the body becomes increasingly frail, our primary task is to successfully adapt to more profound levels of functional decline, frailty, and dependence and (ii) Age-related Health Care for Psychological Challenges of Aging. Dementia, Grief, Depression, Isolation, Reconciliation.
Potential solutions
1. Encourage and teach the ageing population about lifestyle choices that are healthier, such as how to eat right, the long-term effects of alcohol and tobacco consumption and consistent exercise. Health promotion and disease prevention need to be widely adopted. This is necessary for preventing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, etc.
2. Provision of adequate long-term care by members of family or caregivers which can be either formal or informal. While through partnerships and sponsorships it is possible to provide formal long-term care facilities, this without a lot of money can only be provided to a select few, thus where possible it is necessary to encourage informal long-term care, as this is a lot easier to obtain than formal care. Family members need to be appropriately educated in order to provide care and identify any problems that require specific attention. By collaborating with hospitals, we can enlist nurses to provide families with the training they need to take care of their dependents.
3. Providing opportunities for engaging in a personally meaningful activity, allowing individuals who have self-esteem while respecting ones self, others, and the environment.
4. A deterrent to the ageing population participating in society could be their physical environment. Access to transport and improvement in disability access in public places is necessary so that they can access not just services but be able to participate in social environments and enjoy a better quality of life.
5. It is also important that there is sufficient access to address mental health problems. A culture of prioritizing just physical ailments has led to an increased rate of depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety and other mental health disorders amongst an ageing population, thus it is necessary to provide information on where access to appropriate healthcare can be obtained. Furthermore, drop-in sessions can be facilitated which provide advice to those in need.
6. Enhance the interaction with the person with Dementia, it is important to apply the Montessori principles Relate, Motivate, Appreciate.
7. Another aspect that needs to be addressed is an improvement of social needs for the ageing unemployed population. A significant portion of the ageing population is physically able to participate in society, thus it is possible to enrol them in volunteering activities. It enables them to be a productive member of society while being in a social environment where they can meet and interact with people from all walks of life.
8. The issue of ageism needs to be tackled by working with groups representing and working for the ageing population, by portraying realistic and positive images of the ageing population through media. This is necessary to tear down discriminatory practices and rebrand attitudes towards the older generation in Sri Lanka.
9. Cluster homes for senior citizens- The proposal is for a PPP to build low-cost homes built to ICTAD standards in clusters with central service facilities with each room and toilet costing less than SLR 500,000. The homes should be culturally and environmentally friendly with rooms (5-8 rooms around an inner courtyard with therapeutic gardening options). Philanthropists could lease land. The State may subsidies outright or in part the cost of building with options for the leasing of units by beneficiaries from Government and /or selling back units. Units could also be auctioned to beneficiaries with a ceiling on bidding. A percentage could be set aside to be given free to homeless poor, abandoned seniors due to past conflict. Beneficiaries /families could collectively determine service providers. The clusters could potentially be administered by cooperative societies for Government.
It would provide for home based rehab services to improve their functional status and/or minimize further deterioration, receive home palliative care in accordance to their wishes to achieve maximal quality of life during their last days at home, cared for through a person centred care approach, receive appropriate continence and bowel care that strives to promote independence where appropriate, receive routine assessment for pain and appropriate management to relieve suffering from pain, in a safe physical environment that minimises the risk of falls and injuries, and have access to equipment that enhances their safety depending on identified needs and risks.
10. Supporting active ageing of retir Senior Citizens from armed forces.
* Providing access to full time, part time and volunteer opportunities to deploy, skills, knowledge and experience through Employment for Elders) through a dedicated website.
* A Senior centre for self-help groups for fellowship (music, dance, yoga), options to order healthy food; use a library, psychological and mental support.
* Providing access to information on Physical Challenges of Aging including but not limited to -Functional Decline, Age-related Disease, Age-related.
Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne through State Secretary Sunil Samaraweera a veteran on Social care has acted and moved on many fronts on this subject.
Extending the occupational life of Senior Citizens in Sri Lanka- letter DG Pensions
We write with reference to our letter of December 21, 2016 addressed to S/PM and response of January 3, 2017 copies of which are appended for ease of reference in which we are for the expansion of the labour market to individuals from ages 55 to 70. We are currently developing a platform named Employment for Seniors (EFS) which primarily aims to connect mature job-seekers with potential job-providers, and mature volunteers with areas of need. Employers who wish to hire mature workers would post vacant positions within their organisations on the EFS system.
Individuals aged 50 years or older, and interested in employment, may register as a client at EFS by requesting an appointment. Clients would be scheduled to meet with qualified volunteer counsellors and receive referrals to the posted companies based on preference, ability and training experienced. Then, clients may contact an employer of their choice directly to apply for the position available.
Mature job-seekers would benefit through attaining guidance and support from a volunteer job counsellor; job referrals and advocacy of their skills to employers; an annual senior job fair featuring extensive career educational programmes and networking opportunities; workshops and resources which will aid in gaining employment, leading to financial stability.
We thus seek your support to:
 Jointly develop a flyer to share with all pensioners;
 Seek a mature group of Lead Volunteers to locate in 24 Districts to guide seniors.
 Enable pensioners who wish to register for the services offered through the platform.
 Seek your nominee to support guide this initiative.
Would you like to respond DG pensions
We have laboured long and hard to ensure our seniors remain in good physical and mental shape. We have knocked ceaselessly on many doors.
This article should show the length and breadth of detail and opportunities lay on the table. An MoU to ensure every single pensioner benefits and is able to access to options lies dormant at the Dept. of Pensions for months with no interest in moving it forward. Its not good enough to send the monthly pension and stop doing so when the pensioner dies and is buried or cremated.
There is a duty to care beyond Mr DG Pensions. This applies equally to those at the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social services whose delegated tasks for which they draw a month salary is the well-being of seniors. It might be useful to know the Government of Singapore has identified the number of seniors who will live single and those who need home visits along with the required human resources to services needs. Mr and Mrs Sri Lankan public servant, would you care to do likewise

Budding young chefs armed with forks, knives and ladles battled in this gastronomic venture creating delicacies which will not only tantalize taste buds but will also be a feast for the eyes. Chefs between 18 to 26 years took part in the event. The 2018 Olympiad had three rounds as compared to four rounds in the previous years. The event kicked off with an opening ceremony which was held at Talkatora Stadium in Delhi on January 28. The first round of the competition for each team took place in Delhi, Pune or Bangalore. The second round and the Grand Finale were held in Kolkata at The Hyatt Regency and the IIHM campus.
Before the finals, a special event was organised for all the participants and for their mentors. A symposium held for mentors at the Hyatt Regency on the penultimate day was followed by a special cooking session that was additional to the competition. The special session was titled United World of Young Chefs and each student had to prepare their national dish. At the end of the evening, the finalists names were announced.
You qualify for the finals after you get through the first and second rounds. They gave us a list of the dishes we had to make three months before the competition. I made an Eggs Florentine and a Lemon Souffl for the first round. Everyone had to cook the same recipe during this round. It was simply about us being able to follow the basics. We had to prepare a vegan and a vegetarian meal for the second round. The starter had to be vegan while the main course and the dessert needed to be vegetarian. I made a tofu based starter which had an Asian touch to it. Ratatouille deep fried in noodles was my main course and for dessert I whipped up a buckwheat nuga and a mint jelly. We had to make a chicken dish and a dessert comprising of shoe pastry for the finals, Thivara recalled.
Thivara has made a stuffed chicken roulade and a shoe pastry with cream cheese and cinnamon filling with malt whiskey sauce. Eleven competitors made it to the finals at the event.
A Malaysian competitor won the competition. His menu was similar to mine but the techniques he had used in cutting up the chicken and presenting it was very different to mine. I really admire his output, she said.
She notes that they were judged while they were preparing the food as well as when they have finished making the dishes.
I was selected to take part in the Young Chef Olympiad 2018 after I won a silver medal at the Chefs Guild competition. A team of 10 William Angliss Institute students took part in the event. I was the one who topped the team, she explained.
Thivara has always had a flair for cooking. Though she had followed the commerce stream at Ladies College, Colombo, she soon realized that the culinary art is her forte. She was the winner in the schools culinary art competition The Pineapple Trophy in 2009 and 2011. The competition was judged by chefs from a leading hotel in Colombo.
The first time we had to make dinner for a delegate. The second time we had to make something for tea. My work was appreciated by the jury and I managed to clinch first place both times, she enthused.
Apart from these wins the 24 year old has also taken part in Canada Prima Bake Masters in 2015 and the Italian Competition in 2017.
A group of us competed at the Canada Prima Bake Masters 2015 and we won second place. The competition was all about baking using Canadian ingredients, she noted.
Home Science was my favourite subject at school. Even at home I would spend my free time experimenting with ingredients in the kitchen. My siblings, Virantha and Amaya, were the ones who graded my work. They loved it when I cooked, Thivara added with a smile.
Though her parents Janaka and Bimalka Fernando were both into the garment industry, they stood by her decision to enter the field of culinary arts. Thivara began her route to gastronomic delights by volunteering for the Chefs Guild Sri Lanka in 2015. Her mentor was Chef Kapila Jayanetti, Senior Academic Head Culinary, William Angliss Institute at SLIIT, mentor for YCO 2015  2017 and the mentor for Young Chefs Club of Lanka (Youth Arm of Chefs Guild of Lanka).
Speaking about being a woman in a field which is dominated by males, Thivara said that more women have ventured into the field in recent years.
There is an increase in female chefs in recent years. I completed a four month internship at the Jetwing Hotels head office, where I worked under the E-commerce team in 2016. I was the only female chef there. I believe that this is due to our culture. People believe that the hospitality industry should be male dominant but the views are changing overtime, she said.
She says that the field cannot be based on gender. Passion for the subject needs to be considered first.
There are so many females who have the flair for cooking but hesitate to get into the industry because they are scared of the social outlook. Another chef from Iceland and I were the only female chefs who made it to the finals at the Young Chef Olympiad 2018, she said.
Though she does not have a signature dish as such she loves specializing in desserts. She is also a fan of the Italian cuisine because she loves the flavours and the techniques they employ. She is currently studying commercial cookery. Her ambition is to work in Australia for a span and to return to her motherland to open her own restaurant.
Her message to other youth who like to venture into culinary art is to follow their dreams.
Do not be afraid of what others think or say. It took a little convincing to get my parents to give me the green light to go ahead with my passion. However everything paid off after I excelled in the field. So just go for it and follow your heart, she concluded.

Policy decision made on absorbing health workers
A policy decision has been made to absorb health workers who have completed 180 days of work into the permanent carder, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, he has failed to implement some decisions made by him due to the bureaucracy which exists within the Health Ministry. The bureaucracy hinders the forward march of the health service, the Minister said.
He was addressing the Health Trade Unions May Day celebration held at the Jayewardene Centre in Colombo yesterday.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that some officials are similar to that of parasites. Their contribution towards the advancement of the health sector is minimal, he said. Decisions are made after discussions with trade unions and once those decisions are implemented, I take the responsibility, he said.
After making decisions, trade union leaders and trade unionists have to go after health officials and beg them to implement the decisions. The bureaucracy should be defeated. All health workers should be provided with training and a valid certificate. Promotions should be given on talent, the Minister added.

Political robots disrobed
Most of the politicians in Sri Lanka are not given to public service.
This is because service has acquired a menial connotation. In a complex society as todays, we cannot produce by ourselves all that we require living a normal human life. Especially today, we cannot supply all our needs by ourselves alone; we depend on the fair and dependable commitment of others to their regular work or services for us to live our lives without too many challenging difficulties. All of us depend on one another. We cannot live justly and fairly without contributing according to our skill and capacity our share of work to the community, that is, to the lives of others and to the lives of those who are not able to support themselves due to some disability.
Political robots have had the misfortune of getting programmed with minds and attitudes of hate. Like automatons, they make irrational excuses undermining equality and for perpetuating bias and divisive discrimination. They cause the country to get mired in disunity and stagnation. One cannot live justly and fairly when ones thought is filled with hate leading to hateful actions. This is why those who misuse things and abuse people are filled with disgust with all that they have misused and with themselves for misusing them, destroying others and themselves in the process.
New methods of education need to be evolved to build healthy hearts and minds and heal unhealthy ones to let them appreciate the meaning and consequential values of human dignity, equality and liberty.
Parliamentary sessions
They should be educated to think creatively to proceed through a transformative process to live a civilized life. Though we have been an Independent country for over seventy years, most of the ruling class have inherited or artificially put on and become wrapped up in a feudal mentality given over to leisurely lazy living, merely giving orders to others and enjoying the fruits of other peoples toil as if working for a living, to earn ones bread with the sweat of ones brow, with the striving of ones own hands and minds were beneath their dignity. As a result, there are those who according to their capability is not proportionately, sufficiently or at all contributing their share to the development of the country and the well being of others.
Prominent political robots of parties with decrepit ideologies unconnected to the humanity of all the people of todays society are among those who have put on this decadent and iniquitous feudal mentality. Most Sri Lankan politicians have divested themselves of their inherent humanity and polluted themselves with selfishness and dishonesty imprisoning themselves in the servitude of corruption.
It is due to this iniquitous, which means unequal and unjust mentality that politicians have surrounded themselves with privileges in an overblown manner foolishly claiming them to be their rights. This makes the politician far above the others, arrogating to themselves more than their rights and allowing others less than their due rights.
Thinking egoistically, they forcibly take over powers they are not vested with, break the law and intimidate the people. It is due to this incongruous and bizarre mentality that parliamentarians have arrogated to themselves a disproportionate range of privileges that cost the taxpaying citizens a vast expense. So they get for themselves several perks such as allowances for the attendance of parliamentary sessions, overblown housing rent, office and telephone expenses, entertainment and travelling expenses, highly subsidized meals, allowances to meet expenses supposed to be incurred in serving the people. Besides all these Ministers arrogate to themselves privileges peculiarly extended to each ministry.
Besides, there are also highly fraudulent transactions which bring in unaccountable incomes which are sometimes secretively hidden in foreign banks. All these get covered with an aura of legitimacy and contribute to raising the cost of living for the people.
The privilege they should certainly enjoy is the right to speak freely inside the chamber of the House of Parliament. Just because they cannot be prosecuted for what they speak, they are morally bound to speak the truth and nothing but the truth in the assembly that is made august not only because it is the highest legislative assembly in the land but also because all that is expressed there are supposed to be true, reliable and honourable. And its purpose is to uphold justice for the people. If to protect the common good and the rights of all the people, certain individuals thievery, culpable incompetence and unacceptable public conduct have to be exposed and such individuals have to be accused of wrongdoing, such exposure of misconduct and accusation is a service done to the people and in the name of the people.
As everything said in the highest assembly is factual and relevant, it is presumed that nothing is said merely to hurt, disparage and ruin the character of anyone. That would be a breach of privilege whether it is accepted or not. However, the truth could hurt the wrong-doer.
But our politicians are so thick-skinned, that even after large-scale fraud and corruption they show no sense of guilt or shame. They astutely hide them and cleverly try to evade responsibility for their deeds even though they feel their cancerous leprosies continually consume them internally.
The iniquitous person hates his own being. Yet they could be human enough to be sensitive, acknowledge their wrongdoing and repent, like the good thief on the cross to Jesus right who desired salvation. But their arrogance is such that they wish others to imagine them to be innocent among thieves, like Jesus Christ who died between two thieves! It is when they have been so insensitive as to abuse their power and deceive and swindle the people as a whole that they turn into hideous political robots and not servant leaders of the people. Servanthood is demeaning to these arrogant feudal-minded foxes sprung from the prototype and mould of King Herod. Their political parties are like ships irretrievably grounded on sand dunes. They are never guided by the stars of truth and justice, equality of all the people, freedom of thought, civilized expression and choice and openness to human enhancement.
Corrupt elements
In the circumstances, political party restructuring could turn out to be merely a formula for evasion of honesty, social justice, responsibility, accountability, and the rooting out of falsehood, inequality, self-indulgence and favouritism. That should not happen.
However much you reorganise and restructure, if the same old corrupt elements will manage the new structures in their habitual style they will find new ways to fend for themselves according to their base desires. Even to adopt a New Constitution is to basically change structures of the legislature, the executive and the judiciary, to give them a more reliable new tone to make them effective in truth and justice and peoples well-being and to usher a renewed social culture.
Adopting a New Constitution is indeed a sine qua non to truly institute the sovereignty of the people and thus to meet their just aspirations of human dignity and rights of equality, freedom and honour based on truth, justice, solidarity and that peace which is the inheritance of those of goodwill and not of evil intent and conspiratorial scheming. Goodwill towards all the people is the prominent element absent among the politicians and the political environment of Sri Lanka. A superficial hail fellow well-met type of passing camaraderie has no social depth nor is it durable goodwill.
But this insincere exhibitionistic manner of conduct by the cunning politicians often displayed to the public is what has so far prevented the adoption of a New Constitution that is just and fair by all the citizens of Sri Lanka.

Scent and sensibility
A scent speaks much about your persona. The trail of fragrance that you leave behind will determine how you spend your day to a large extent. Get a little nosy about the subject with these pointers and make your scent make your day!
Choosing the right perfume
A fragrance is very physical so if it is love at first spritz, it means you have found your confidence-boosting scent. Spritz one of your favourite scents to your skin, let it settle and see if it still feels right at the end of the day. Test it on people you love and hear what they say. But most importantly, check if does boost your confidence and makes you feel fabulous.
Perfume, deodorant or body spray
Using a deodorant is a definite must as a deodorant is a substance applied to the body to prevent body odour caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. Perfumes are a mixture of different aromatic extracts and oils that give pleasant odours. On the other hand, a body spray is just a milder form of perfume. Perfumes are costlier than body sprays. The body sprays that are more like scented alcohol are less concentrated and lighter.
Testing a perfume
Test the perfume on blotting paper or a tissue or apply a few drops or the lightest spray to your wrist or the back of your hand. Dont sniff it right away. Wait a few minutes. Give the fragrance time to bloom on your skin.
Skin type and perfumes
Perfume experts cannot stress this enough: what smells good on one person may smell different on another. It is not just a matter of taste or preference or a matter of how the nose perceives a certain smell. Rather, its a matter of how the body and skin reacts with the ingredients of a certain fragrance. The truth is that a brand of perfume can be the Number 1 best-selling fragrance across the globe but it is not going to smell great on everyone because of each persons unique body chemistry.
Differences between Eau de Parfum, Eau de Toilette, aftershave and cologne
The main difference between types of fragrance lies in the concentration of essences. The order of highest to lowest concentration is first perfume, second, Eau de Parfum, third, Eau de Toilette, and fourth Eau de Cologne. Perfume is very expensive because it can have up to 40 percent concentration of essences.
Niche perfumes
Boutique artisanal perfume studios whose production is on a much smaller scale and whose presence in mainstream retail stores is minimal or non-existent are thus referred to as niche. These are the scents you might likely find at a perfume specialist or high-end fragrance boutique.
Perfumes for daytime and perfumes for nighttime
There are no rules that some perfumes should be worn at daytime while others are reserved for nighttimes. Basically, wear a fresh light perfume in the day time, and strong and dark tone smelling ones at night time. This is because day time is usually warmer than night time, and vice versa.
The amount of perfume one should spray on oneself
Fragrances latch onto fibers, which is why the strands of your hair will carry the scent of perfume for a long-lasting effect. Spray your scent of choice behind the ear lobes. This area is a pulse point, where the body is warmer, which will serve to enhance the fragrance. However it is not advisable to wear more than one perfume at a time.
Fragrance and mood changes
Fragrances can both affect and change your moods. Not only does fragrance affect the mood, but it can actually enhance work performance and behaviour in various ways.
Making a perfume last long
The best time to spray on a perfume is after a shower or bath. Well-hydrated skin holds fragrance the best, so spritz a fragrance after getting out of the shower and applying unscented body lotion.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who visited Hanoi last week, at the invitation of his Vietnamese counterpart, President of the National Assembly Nguyen Thi Kim Ngn, presented relics of the Lord Buddha to Vietnam at the end of bilateral discussions.
The relics would be deposited with a befitting traditional ceremony at a famous Vietnamese temple in Hanoi in the near future. Vietnamese government as well as the Vietnamese Buddhist Sangha highly appreciated the gift of relics.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was accompanied by members of the Sri Lanka  Vietnam Parliamentary Friendship Group comprising of Members of Parliament Ramesh Pathirana, Bimal Ratnayake, Vidura Wickramanayake, Sujith Sanjaya Perera and Buddhika Pathirana.

Lose the most points in ODI rankings
Sri Lanka slips to ninth in T20I rankings behind Afghanistan
Following the annual update of the ICC ODI and T20I Team rankings Sri Lanka have slipped to ninth position (from eighth) in the T20I standings behind newcomers Afghanistan (ranked 8th) and in the ODI rankings although retaining eighth position they have lost the most points  7 (from 84 to 77).
Sri Lanka had a horrendous 2017 year where they lost 23 of 29 ODIs and 10 out of 15 T20Is.
Meanwhile England have overtaken India to seize the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings while Nepal have rejoined the T20I ratings but will need to play one more match before they are ranked on the ICC T20I rankings.
Englands rise up the table is largely because of a forgettable 2014-15 season which saw them winning only seven out of 25 ODIs against other Full Members. The 2014-15 season has been dropped from the latest calculations while those from the 2015-16 and 2016-17 seasons are weighted at 50 per cent.
England, who last topped the ODI rankings in January 2013 have gained eight points and moved to 125 points. India, who were at the top before the update, have lost a solitary point and are in second place with a total of 122 points. South Africa, who were second, have dropped down to third place after losing four points, from 117 to 113, leaving them nine points adrift of India and only one point ahead of fourth- placed New Zealand.
The remaining places remain unchanged, meaning that the current top 10 ranked sides are the ones who will be playing in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019. However, there have been some significant changes in points.
World champions Australia have lost eight points to go down to 104 in fifth position and are only two points ahead of ICC Champions Trophy 2017 winners Pakistan, who have gained six points.
In other changes, Bangladesh (93 points) have gained three points, Sri Lanka (77) have lost seven points, the Windies (69) have lost five points, Afghanistan (63) have gained five points, Zimbabwe (55) have gained four points and 12th-placed Ireland (38) have lost three points.
In the T20I rankings led by Pakistan, there is no change in the top seven places but Afghanistan are now ahead of Sri Lanka in eighth slot.
Pakistan (130) and Australia (126) remain in the first two positions without a change in their points total while India have gained two points to reach 123. New Zealand (116) are unchanged on points while England (115) have gained a solitary point.
Other significant changes on the T20I table see South Africa (114) and the Windies (114) both gain three points with the former ahead on decimals in sixth position, Sri Lanka (85, ninth position) lose four points, Zimbabwe (58, 12th) lose three points, the Netherlands (53, 13th) gain four points, Hong Kong (42, 15th) lose four points and Ireland (33, 17th) lose three points.

Strong voice for horticulture  industry vital
Serendib Horticulture Technologies Chairman and CEO Dilip de Silva says if the government institutes are more amenable to producers and exporters of horticulture products, most of the challenges could be overcome and the opportunities could be made into reality.
Speaking to Daily News Business, Dilip de Silva said that the government agencies should support exporters in their endeavour to reach markets and archaic regulations of import and exports should be looked into on a case by case basis. Commenting on improving the industry in Sri Lanka, Dilip de Silva said there should be only one Ministry dedicated to Horticulture.
At the moment there are several ministries involved. This model will never work in improving the industry.
We will be stagnant while all the other countries are advancing. I hope the President and the Prime Minister will give serious consideration to this point of view when assigning responsibilities to the new ministries.
Also commenting on increases in fuel prices, he said, that would certainly have a negative impact on the market.
Firstly, our production costs will go up and then the costs of our customers who have greenhouses which need heating will also have a higher bill to pay. We need to be very mindful about the cost. If the market is going to stagnate or decline, then expansion of business will have to be put on hold and we would concentrate on existing orders.
In the meantime, Serendib Horticulture Technologies on its global expansion as consultants in plant biotechnology has been contracted to an Iranian company, Zarkesht in the province of Mazendaran.
Commenting on the latest venture of the company, he said that they have been working for over a year on the consultancy with the objective of transforming an existing laboratory in Iran to a commercial entity at the invitation of its owners.
Dilip de Silva further said, Its an honor for the company and the country to be invited to Iran, which is a technologically advanced country, to transfer the companys technology to Iran.
The companys main objective is to introduce commercial technology in plant tissue culture and to introduce management information systems in order to make labs in the host country more productive and competitive.
In April this year, two of its Mangers, Shyamali Widyarathne and Prasanna Thirimanna along with Dilip de Silva were invited for two weeks to train the staff in commercial applications, development of protocols and to develop a management information system.
This was successfully completed. We have now been invited to take up a management contract for a period of two years, said Dilip de Silva.
When other countries are seeking our advice and technology to improve their horticulture industries, Sri Lanka lacks the commitment to develop horticulture with the locally available technology.
In addition, the company is currently working on another project in Qatar with a private company, where a new lab will be established with the companys expertise.
This will also open up job opportunities for Sri Lankan diploma holders and graduates. The company will be interviewing for job opportunities during the next two weeks.

Students will enter into the loan agreement with the Bank of Ceylon who will provide the loan facilities, with a loan repayment period extending up to 10-12 years.
The commencement of payment will be upon gaining employment.
Acting Vice Chancellor, Horizon Campus, Dr. Ruwan Perera welcoming the new students selected for this years scheme said that Our aim through partnering this scheme is to produce the thought leaders that will develop and drive new businesses for our country.
Chairman, Horizon Campus, Upul Daranagama said that initiatives of this nature was a solution for the country to retain their talent pool and prevent brain drain, providing both the opportunity and accessibility for students to qualify and remain in the country to improve local industries and businesses through new and innovative approaches, that will also result in improving the countrys local economy. Minister Mohanlal Grero, the Chief Guest at the occasion informed that the government has at present spent over 35 billion on higher education, which showcases the importance that they place towards producing a nation of qualified youth to serve our local industries.
Horizon Campus firmly believes that this new interest free loan scheme will be helpful towards enhancing educational opportunities for students in the country and in ushering in new horizons in the Sri Lankan tertiary education market.

Tips to lighten dark underarms
Some of the main causes of dark underarms are shaving, regular use of hair removing creams, excessive sweating, poor ventilation of underarms, accumulation of dead skin cells, and use of alcohol-based deodorants and antiperspirants.
You can easily get rid of dark underarms using simple home remedies that are safe, effective, natural and affordable.
1. Potato
The mild acidic property present in potatoes is a great natural bleaching agent. Unlike strong bleaching agents, it will not cause skin irritation.
* Simply rub a thin slice of potato on your underarms.
* You can also grate the potato and apply the juice to the affected area, allow it to dry for 15 to 20 minutes and then wash it off with lukewarm water.
Use either of these remedies twice daily for better and faster results.
2. Cucumber
Just like potatoes, cucumbers also have natural bleaching properties to help lighten discolored skin.
* Simply rub a thin cucumber slice on your underarms or grate a cucumber and apply the juice under your arms. Do this once or twice daily until you are satisfied with the results.
* Another option is to extract the juice from a cucumber and mix it with a little turmeric powder and lemon juice. Apply this paste on the affected area. Leave it on for 30 minutes, and then wash it off with water. Repeat this home remedy once daily or every other day for best results.
3. Lemon
Lemon works as a natural bleach and a powerful antibacterial and antiseptic agent. This is why lemon is used in the treatment of various skin-related problems including dark underarms. Lemon can dry out your skin, so apply a moisturizer after using these remedies if needed.
* To remove dead skin cells and lighten your underarms, rub a lemon wedge on the skin for a few minutes. Leave the juice on your skin for about 10 minutes and then wash the area thoroughly. For better exfoliation, you can sprinkle a little sugar on the lemon wedge and then use it. Do this a few times a week.
* Another option is to mix a little turmeric powder, honey or plain yogurt in some lemon juice and apply it to your underarms. Leave it on for about 10 minutes and then wash it off. Repeat three or four times a week.
4. Baking Soda
Baking soda can be used to make an exfoliating scrub to get rid of dark underarms. This will help remove dead skin cells, which is one of the main causes of dark underarms. It will also help unclog skin pores.
1. Mix baking soda and water to make a thick paste.
2. Use this paste to scrub your underarms.
3. Wash it off and pat dry the area thoroughly.
4. Repeat a few times a week.
You can also apply a light dusting of equal parts of baking soda and cornstarch to neutralize body odor.
5. Orange Peel
Orange peels can be used to lighten the skin under your arms, thanks to their skin lightening and exfoliating properties.
1. Put some orange peels in the sun for a few days until they dry out completely.
2. Grind the dried peels into powder form.
3. Mix two teaspoons of powdered orange peels with enough rose water and milk to make a thick paste.
4. Gently scrub your underarms with the paste and then leave it on for about 10 to 15 minutes.
5. Finally, wash the area with cold water.
6. Repeat the process two or three times a week.
6. Coconut Oil
Coconut oil is another good option to get rid of dark underarms. Coconut oil contains vitamin E that can help lighten the underarms. At the same time, it will also work as an effective natural deodorant.
1. Massage the dark underarms with coconut oil.
2. Leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes.
3. Wash it off with mild soap and lukewarm water.
4. Repeat two or three times daily until you achieve the desired results.

Trump delays decision on steel  and aluminium tariffs
US President Donald Trumps administration has extended negotiations on steel and aluminium tariffs for 30 days with Canada, the EU and Mexico.
It has also reached a deal in principle with Argentina, Brazil and Australia.
In March, Mr Trump imposed worldwide tariffs of 25% on US imports of steel and 10% on aluminium.
Some countries were then exempted temporarily from those tariffs, including Canada, the EU and Mexico.
The EU said delaying the decision prolongs market uncertainty, which was already having an effect on businesses.
It was open to discussions, it said, but warned: As a longstanding partner and friend of the US, we will not negotiate under threat.
China was not included in the exemptions and later retaliated with its own duties on some US imports.
Mr Trump responded by calling for further US tariffs against China, escalating trade tensions between the two giants.
South Korea was given an indefinite exemption in return for a 30% cut in its steel exports to the US.
In all of these negotiations, the administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security, a statement from the White House said.
The statement said the details of the agreements with Argentina, Brazil and Australia would be finalised shortly.
Canada and Mexico had previously been given exemptions until 1 May while talks took place over Nafta (the North America Free Trade Agreement), as had Argentina, Australia, Brazil and the EU.
After a week-long charm offensive from both French President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the Trump administration has decided to kick the can down the road.
This delay gives the administration more time to convince trading partners to perhaps consider quotas in lieu of tariffs - a concession to which South Korea has already agreed. But even with this extension, its anyones guess as to just what will constitute a win for a president who has promised to put America first.
The EU reacted firmly to the US decision, insisting that it should be fully and permanently exempted from these measures, as they cannot be justified on the grounds of national security.
It has already threatened a series of countermeasures if that does not happen.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday his government had been in regular contact with the White House on Canadas temporary exemption to metals tariffs. Canada is the biggest exporter of steel to the US.
In response to Tuesdays announcement, the UK said it would continue to work closely with its EU partners and the US government to achieve a permanent exemption.
We remain concerned about the impact of these tariffs on global trade and will continue to work with the EU on a multilateral solution to the global problem of overcapacity, as well as to manage the impact on domestic markets, a UK government spokesperson said. (BBC)

UK car production  falls as domestic demand slumps
The number of cars made in Britain fell in February as domestic demand slumped by double digit figures, industry figures suggest.
The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said that 145,475 vehicles were built during the month - 4.4% fewer than a year previously. It blamed a 17% fall in production for the UK market, where consumers are holding back on big ticket purchases.
Boss Mike Hawes said the figures were of considerable concern. More than eight out of ten cars made in Britain are exported, with demand in this market dipping only slightly in February, according to the figures. However, it was domestic demand that suffered, falling from 34,143 to 28,336 units - the seventh consecutive month of decline at home. According to analysts, new car sales have been falling in the UK as Brexit-related uncertainty weighs on consumer spending decisions.
They also blame the weaker pound since the Brexit vote, which has made imported vehicles more expensive, and confusion over the future of diesel. Last week, ratings agency Moodys said it expected new car registrations to fall 5.5% in 2018, following a 5.7% drop in 2017. -BBC

US stocks fall on worries about trade, Iran
Wall Street stocks finished lower on Monday (April 30) as worries about trade conflicts and Iran policy pushed aside positive earnings announcements.
US stocks started the day on a high note following strong McDonalds earnings and a stream of merger announcements, but weakened midday around the time that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran of lying about its nuclear intentions.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 148.04 points (0.61 per cent) to close at 24,163.15.
The broad-based S&P 500 dropped 21.86 points (0.82 per cent) to end the session at 2,648.05, and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index also shed 53.53 points (0.75 per cent) to 7,066.27.
Major deals unveiled ahead of Mondays session included T Mobiles proposed buyout of Sprint.
But shares of Sprint nosedived 13.8 per cent and T Mobile fell 6.2 per cent on doubts that regulators will permit the transaction to close. Other telecom companies also slid, including Dow member Verizon, which shed 4.3 per cent. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, attributed the markets change of heart to geopolitical concerns as investors try to guess whether President Donald Trump will withdraw the US from the Iran nuclear deal.
The unease also comes ahead of a Tuesday deadline for the Trump administration to enact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, Canada, Mexico and four other counties that currently benefit from exemptions.
McDonalds surged 5.8 per cent as it reported that first-quarter earnings rose 13.2 per cent to US$1.4 billion, easily topping analyst expectations following strong sales in the US, China and other markets.
Twitter jumped 4.5 per cent after announcing a venture to partner with Disneys ESPN business on a live sports venture. Disney rose 1.1 per cent. Andeavor surged 13.1 per cent after it agreed to be acquired by fellow refiner Marathon Petroleum for US$23.3 billion. Marathon dropped 8.4 per cent. Channel NewsAsia

Vesak celebrations in Canberra
Vesak was celebrated at the Sri Lanka High Commission in Canberra on Sunday April 29 with the participation of Sri Lankan community and Australian officials. The celebrations commenced with the invoking of blessings and chanting of pirith by the resident Venerable Theras of the Sri Lanka Buddhist Vihara in Canberra, followed by a short Anusasana and Buddha Pooja.
The High Commission staff presented Bhakthi Gee while High Commissioner S. Skandakumar joined in to sing the final song "Poya Sande Sanda Kiranin" whose theme was for a world that exists in righteousness and peace. Live music was provided by the Canberra based Nada Roo Music Group.
Addressing the gathering High Commissioner Skandakumar said the teachings of the Buddha, notably on tolerance, compassion and equanimity were important lessons for our day to day lives. It was for that reason that Vesak is celebrated universally, no matter what ones religious faith might be. He referred to the manner in which Ven. Walpola Rahula Thera was assisted in 1930, in his early education by a Jaffna born Tamil, Saravanamuttu Thangarajah, a school teacher at St Thomas' College, who unhesitatingly opened his home in Udahamulla to the Thera and supported him. The relationship was so close that when his benefactor passed away, the Venerable Thera could not stop the flow of tears.
The High Commissioner also reflected on India's Independence in 1947 that saw large scale loss of life and displacements and pointed out that six months later Ceylon - as Sri Lanka was then called - was granted her Independence in a peaceful and dignified manner that was envied by all.
"That Independence was achieved not by aggression but through the intellect of our eminent fellow citizens represented by Sinhalese, Tamils, Burghers, Muslims and Malays and showcased what we were capable of when we came together, respected and supported each other, he said. The High Commissioner added "in the nineties when a devout Sinhala Buddhist embraced a conservative Tamil Hindu it had a magical effect on our Nation's cricket. I refer to Arjuna Ranatunge and Muthiah Muralitharan". Continuing further, he recalled how the whole Nation came together to raise funds to purchase a pet scan machine for the Maharagama Cancer Institute, that helps to diagnose life threatening illnesses in their early stages. He observed that it was commissioned in the presence of the Health Minister by a young boy who was terminally ill; cancer did not ask that little boy what his ethnicity was before it affected him, reminding us all of how vulnerable each of us are. Yet, what that boy has is the love and prayers of all Sri Lankans in his battle.
The High Commissioner finally noted that Lord Buddha stressed the impermanence of life; and it is inevitable that one day God will call time on each of our lives.
When that occurs, the only asset we will take with us is our conscience. He noted that real happiness comes from being at peace with that conscience because no human being can ever hope to build his happiness on a fellow beings unhappiness.
In conclusion, the High Commissioner wished everyone "Peace For Your Conscience". The High Commission premises was adorned with Buddhist flags and colourful Vesak lanterns made by the staff.

Voting for Most Popular title enters final phase
All arrangements have been finalized to hold the annual selections for the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest shortly. As usual, the selections will be made by a panel comprising umpires and school cricket officials.
The lists of the top performers have already been submitted. The names of the most outstanding cricketers who will be considered for respective awards have already been shortlisted. But the final selections will be made by a special selection panel, headed by the President of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) Oshara Panditharathna.
The special selection panel will comprise of officials from the SLSCA as well as representatives from umpiring bodies, including the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association.
This years Mega Show is of greater importance as Sri Lankas first school cricket awards show will be celebrating its 40th anniversary. Last week, we went down memory lane to discover the four-decade long unique story behind the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, especially its first half since 1979.
Way back in 1979, the then Royal College captain Ranjan Madugalle was taken by surprise when the Sunday Observer introduced the countrys first-ever school cricket awards show.
In fact, Madugalle, who now serves as the Chief Match Referee of the ICC after captaining Sri Lanka with distinction, was totally unaware that there would be an awards show for outstanding schoolboy cricketers after the 1978/79 First X1 season.
Since Madugalle became the first recipient of the most prestigious award in school cricket, the Mega Show has produced many legendary Sri Lanka cricketers who have made their presence felt in the international arena in a big way.
Following the footsteps of Madugalle and Ranatunga was Roshan Mahanama of Nalanda College who became the first ever player to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in successive years (1983 and 1984).
Then another Nalandian, who had been in the audience to witness Mahanamas crowning glory  Asanka Gurusinha, was adjudged the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 1985.
The organizers of the Mega Show always believed in the rich outstation talent and the need to lend them a helping hand while inspiring them to become future national players. It was with these goals in mind that a separate segment for outstation school is accommodated.
It was through the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Outstation contest that yet another legendary Sri Lanka cricketer, named Sanath Jayasuriya, had been born.
From his school days at St. Servetius College, Matara, Jayasuriya had shown signs of a world class cricketer. His willow had been a nightmare for the then bowlers in school cricket. His rich harvest for St. Servatius won him the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Outstation title in 1988.
Recalling that great milestone in his cricket career that had taken place exactly 30 years ago, Jayasuriya said it is one of the most unforgettable moments in his career.
Not only me, but also my parents, brother, relatives, coaches and school masters, were thrilled and excited to witness that moment of glory. They all enjoyed that cherished moment. It was a great feeling. All past winners, be it the All-Island or Outstation, had made their mark in Sri Lanka cricket. So, when I won the title, I felt that I am getting closer to earning a place in the national squad, said Jayasuriya, the most valuable player at the 1996 World Cup tournament.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year produced a galaxy of stars in the next three years too  Kumara Dharmasena, Marvan Atapattu and Muttiah Muralitharan. ICC Elite Panel umpire, Dharmasena won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award in 1989, followed by Atapattu and Muralitharan.
It was one of the greatest moments in my career. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration.
That helped and encouraged me to play for Sri Lanka. Winning such a mega award gives a huge image and confidence to a schoolboy cricketer to go places. We were determined to reach the top of the ladder and did so with dedication, the former Sri Lanka all-rounder Dharmasena said. The next star to emerge through the contest after him was former Ananda College, SSC and Sri Lanka captain Marvan Atapattu, who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 1990. Atapattu, who had also served as Sri Lanka national coach, said he had considered the mega title as a certification or a guarantee that he would play for Sri Lanka after his school career.
As I had been performing well and scoring constantly for Ananda as a schoolboy cricketer, many considered me as a future Sri Lanka prospect. Although I too had felt that I had a chance, there was no guarantee. All those who had won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title before me had gone on to play for Sri Lanka with distinction. When I won the title ultimately, I knew that I too could play for Sri Lanka within months, he said.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest is not only a part of Sri Lanka cricket history but also in world cricket. The world record holder for the most number of wickets in Test cricket Muttiah Muralitharan too had stepped into the big league through the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest.
Right from his early school cricket career, Muralitharan had been a highly successful bowler and was adjudged Observer Schoolboy Cricketer in 1991 when he was playing for St. Anthonys College, Katugastota. Gracing the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards night as the chief guest seven years ago, Muralitharan went down memory lane.
You are the future Sri Lanka players. You must keep the Sri Lanka flag flying wherever you go, he told the gathering.
Play hard and dedicate yourself, then success is bound to come. As young cricketers, you must keep in mind that only 11 could play in a team. When you get that rare chance of playing, you must put your heart and soul and give hundred percent to the team, so that success will come your way.
Dont be disappointed if you fail once or twice in the early stages of your career. Keep on trying and success is bound to come your way.
Meanwhile, voting for the most popular segments of the 40th Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest, conducted in three divisions, is on its last lap. Voting for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contests could be made through voting coupons which continue to appear in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Dinamina and Thinakaran.

Whats in the lunch box 
A healthy breakfast is important for active children. It is important to offer healthy lunch box choices as well if they miss out on breakfast. Healthy lunch box tips include fresh fruit, crunchy vegetables and a combination of protein, dairy and carbohydrate foods.
Eating healthy food helps children concentrate and learn. However, healthy eating changes are not always easy to make. Try to set a good example with your own lunches. Encourage children
to help choose and prepare their own lunch. They might like to make a list of the foods they enjoy. Praise your child when they choose healthy foods for their lunch box.
There are limited times for children to eat during the day, especially at school. Children may prefer to play with friends instead of eating. Encourage your child to sit and eat before heading out to play.
Food suggestions for lunch boxes
There are lots of food choices available for lunch boxes. However, it can sometimes be difficult to decide which foods are healthy choices. Here are some suggestions for you:
Fruit  best choices include fresh fruit. Dried fruit is sticky and high in sugar, so have it occasionally.
Vegetables  try vegetable sticks with dip or a small container with mixed vegetables such as cherry tomatoes, carrot sticks and cucumber. Chips and packets of crisps are best left for parties and special occasions.
Milk, yoghurt and custard  include a small drink of milk wrapped in a cloth in the lunch box. Fruit yoghurts should be kept cool in an insulated lunch box.
Dips, cheese and biscuits  pre-packaged or your own homemade versions of cheese and crackers are fine. Children enjoy mini packaged cheeses. Avoid sweet dips such as chocolate spreads. Oven-baked savoury biscuits are just as high in salt and fat as chips and are best avoided.
Different breads add interest  include a variety of bread, especially if children begin to lose interest in sandwiches.
Try bread rolls, pita bread, flat bread, bagels, fruit loaf, buns or muffins.
Vary the fillings  fillings can include vegemite or other yeast extract, peanut butter, cheese (try different types), tuna, egg, minced meats, grated carrot, lettuce and chopped roast meat.
Muffins and cakes  try making your own muffins and cakes as a great way to include more fruit and vegetables. Donuts and creamy cakes are best offered at birthdays and special occasions instead of in lunch boxes.
Muesli and breakfast bars  almost all bars are too high in sugar to include regularly, but cereal bars may be better for teeth than chewy sticky muesli bars. Try to avoid muesli bars and chocolate bars in lunch boxes. These are expensive and usually stuck together with fats and sugars.

Why a bill for meters
The sudden implementation of compulsory billing taxi meter system has fallen on all taxies like a severe thunderbolt. Sometimes humans can escape a natural thunderbolt by using his common sense but not a man-made thunderbolt.
What is the dire necessity for the introduction of this law Users of taxies did not clamour for this. The general public believed that all taxies should have metres but not billing meters. As a matter fact, many did not know that there were billing taxi meters. Thus, there was no need for billing taxi meters. Rather than the introduction of billing taxi meters, they were questioning as to why the traffic police did not regularly check on whether the current taxi meters were adjusted to read higher charges. Anyway who created this need
Is it the billing taxi meters importer, whoever it be Did this importer misuse his muscle to prompt the Police or administrative authorities to introduce this unnecessary law for him to make money on a sharing basis
This message should reach the information of the Parliament and the government.

Will Sri Lanka become a force in 7s
Possibly a crash course in 7s fundamentals...and more insight into the sheer volume of legwork they clock up as prep to survive.
The heart and lung busting power is beyond words and perhaps the vital factor, whichever way we approach the form guide for 7s.
Fiji, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, England, Kenya, USA and Samoa showing us the incredible skill and conditioning required surviving at this elite level...all World Series long.
Of course the burning question about Sri Lanka becoming a force ...will unfortunately remain just that ...a big IF.....given our current crop and record on the Asian circuit over the last 5 years.
We need to aim for full time professionals who travel to at least 6 tours annually.
The national squad given huge chunks of game time and quality understanding as a unit in the middle.
This is a decent start with lots to anticipate and evolve....
Naturally Priyantha CEO and director Rohan will be stretched beyond the union comfort zone.
I further believe you must harness as much experience as they can find ...to team up this radical path to regional domination.
As mentioned last week...Kenya and USA have trail-blazed scorching progress, defying logic, science and our imagination.
Their almost surreal transformation leaves islanders like us ....equator friendly and fresh transfusions of hope.
We need to create our warrior class.
If elite class and almost genius need a statement....the Cup finals...Australia v Fiji ...extra time, clock red ...Fiji scrum ...No panic ...just steely belief...islanders score, Australia weep...the world celebrated .what sorcery, what 7s.
Bula bula Fiji.
At home ...its that magnificent Bradby 2nd leg at the Pallekelle cauldron of fire....Trinity have much to do ...while Royal 30+ in the bag. need 70mins of showcase power to blitz the 74th edition back down to sea level oxygen at Reid Avenue HQ and history that elevates them all.
Crucially, it is all in Trinitys hands and depending on Sheiks skill as captain and leader....the nature of this final will duck and dive to script.
I think we all need Trinity to shock confident Royal and really challenge them from kick-off to full time.
Aggression, heart and spirit to play hard ...relentless and skills so sharp...that will make the crowd gasp in admiration.
All roads will lead to Kandy this Saturday...travel early and park sensible...as exit plans are patience and calm...then the way out in order.
The Singer school season is relentless and unforgiving so far ....with a ton more anticipated.
Can Joes step up.....Will Patana force their way back Have Martis and Peteris got the X factor and more to outplay Royal
It boils down to manageable injuries, especially to key players and bench strength.
Teams with the luxury of form and balance will be licking their lips in huge anticipation...as will their faithful following...knowing the quality of finishing.
As islanders and traditions go ...it is all down to our young gladiators to step boldly and play hard but fair at all times.
Respect and decency must prevail.
Bula bula our rugby hearts that believe.
Cheers Sri api!

World Press Freedom Day
Today, countries around the world are celebrating the 25th edition of the World Press Freedom Day. The main celebration is being held in Ghana this year. Launched by the United Nations in December 1993, the World Press Freedom Day has become the internationally recognised occasion to reassess the significance of free media for a democratic society. It is a date to encourage and develop initiatives in favour of press freedom, and to assess the state of press freedom worldwide. It serves as a reminder to governments of the need to respect their commitment to press freedom and is also a day of reflection among media professionals about issues of press freedom and professional ethics. This years theme is Keeping Power in Check: Media, Justice and The Rule of Law.
World Press Freedom Day is a day of support for media which are targets for restraint, or abolition, of press freedom. It is also a day of remembrance for journalists around the world who lost their lives in the exercise of their profession. At least 80 journalists and media workers were killed last year worldwide while more than 260 journalists were jailed. Egyptian photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid (popularly known as Shawkan), arrested in 2013, has won the 2018 UNESCO World Press Freedom Prize. The award honours a person, organisation or institution that has made an outstanding contribution to the defense and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world, and especially when this has been achieved in the face of danger.
More and more journalists worldwide are facing danger, as the latest Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Sans Frontiers (RSF) shows. The climate of hatred is steadily more visible in the Index, which evaluates the level of press freedom in 180 countries. Hostility towards the media from political leaders is no longer limited to authoritarian countries where media-phobia is now so pronounced that journalists are routinely accused of terrorism and all those who dont offer loyalty can be imprisoned. According to RSF, many leaders no longer see the media as an essential part of democracy, but as an adversary to which they openly display aversion. The line separating verbal violence from physical violence is dissolving, the Report adds.
In this years Index, Norway is first for the second year running, followed  as it was last year  by Sweden (2nd). Taiwan (Rank 42) has the freest press in Asia and Bhutan leads South Asia at 84th place. At the other end of the Index, North Korea (180th) is still last. Sri Lanka has fared very creditably in this edition of the index, climbing 10 places to 131 (in 2017, it was 141) which amounts to a vast improvement within just one year. The National Unity Government has made a clear commitment to media freedom and in fact, apart from one isolated incident there have been no attacks against journalists.
The Government has opened investigations into the assassination of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunga, the disappearance of Prageeth Ekneligoda and assaults on several other journalists including Keith Noyahr during the last regime. Several arrests have been made reading these cases and legal proceedings are underway. Many other positive steps have been taken, including the introduction of Right to Information (RTI) laws. White vans are no longer following journalists who are critical of the Government. This momentum should continue and next year, we hope to see an even bigger improvement.
No Government can grant media freedom per se. It is also up to the media organisations and journalists to report with responsibility and within ethical boundaries. Journalism needs more professionalism and it is vital to comprehensively train journalists. They should be given a sound training in ethical, balanced and objective reporting. The intense competition between media houses (both print and electronic) and also the emergence of new outlets such as blogs and social media has created a race to be the first with the news regardless of consequences. The truth can sometimes be a casualty of this process.
Moreover, some media in Sri Lanka are still polarized along ethnic and religious lines. We saw the dangerous consequences of this divide in the recent events in Ampara, Digana and Ginthota. It is also next to impossible to control the flow of fake news on the Internet, though this can have disastrous repercussions. It is heartening to note that both traditional and non-traditional media as well as social media sites are addressing this vital issue to avoid such events in the future.
The media landscape is constantly changing, primarily as a result of the emergence of the internet. Many question whether the traditional print newspaper will survive the next five decades, with many newspapers already having shifted to web or app only editions. This is no doubt a challenge, but it is also an opportunity to engage with younger audiences via multimedia. The keyword here is convergence, with audio, video, text and graphics all coming together to tell the story more effectively and clearly. Regardless of the medium, good journalism will never die because there will always be a story to tell.
