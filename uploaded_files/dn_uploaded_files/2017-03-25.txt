Around 250 feared dead on Black Day in Mediterranean
ITALY: Over 250 African migrants were feared drowned in the Mediterranean Thursday after a charitys rescue boat found five corpses close to two sinking rubber dinghies off Libya.
The UNs refugee agency (UNHCR) said it was deeply alarmed after the Golfo Azzuro, a boat operated by Spanish NGO Proactiva Open Arms, reported the recovery of the bodies close to the drifting, partially-submerged dinghies, 15 miles off the Libyan coast.
We dont think there can be any other explanation than that these dinghies would have been full of people, Proactiva spokeswoman Laura Lanuza told AFP.
It seems clear that they sunk. She added that the inflatables, of a kind usually used by people traffickers, would typically have been carrying 120-140 migrants each.
In over a year we have never seen any of these dinghies that were anything other than packed. Lanuza said the bodies recovered were African men with estimated ages of between 16 and 25.
They had drowned in the 24 hours prior to them being discovered shortly after dawn on Thursday in waters directly north of the Libyan port of Sabrata, according to the rescue boats medical staff.
Vincent Cochetel, director of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR)s Europe bureau, said NGO boats patrolling the area had been called to the aid of a third stricken boat on Thursday afternoon, raising fears others may have perished on what Proactiva called a black day in the Mediterranean. Despite rough winter seas, migrant departures from Libya on boats chartered by people traffickers have accelerated in recent months from already-record levels. Nearly 6,000 people have been picked up by Italian-coordinated rescue boats since the end of last week, bringing the number brought to Italy since the start of 2017 to nearly 22,000, a significant rise on the same period in previous years. Aid groups say the accelerating exodus is being driven by worsening living conditions for migrants in Libya and by fears the sea route to Europe could soon be closed to traffickers. - AFP

Around four percent school children have STDs
Around four percent of schoolchildren in Sri Lanka have some sort of Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and over 10 percent of them are drug addicts, Educational Non Academic Employees Union Secretary Ajithge Thilakaratne said.
Big Matches further promote those. Therefore, Big matches should be completely banned. There is no way of regulating them because no Principal respects and follows circulars issued by the Education Ministry, Thilakaratne said.
Addressing a press conference at the Public Library in Colombo yesterday, he said that one in every 10 school children is a drug addict. Thilakaratne challenged any school Principal who can come forward and claim that no student from his/her school uses drugs. Statistics are incorrect and unavailable because most of the school children afflicted by STDs seek medical treatment from private hospitals with or without the assistance of their parents. Only Rehabilitation Centres, Physiologists and Psychiatrists in the country have current statistics and details of the true picture.According to Thilakaratne, most school Principals do not adhere and follow Education Ministry circulars.
It is the past pupils who control big matches. Any outsider can enter the ground where a big match is played. No only during the big match season, even on normal school days, some children bring drugs into schools hidden inside their shoes, trousers, shirts etc and sell inside schools. This is how they develop sick a mentality and invade girls schools and harass them, he alleged.
Thilakaratne pointed out that his organisation has informed about this situation to the Education Ministry authorities on numerous occasions, but all to no avail. Nothing has been done to prevent this dangerous trend. Now it is up to the parents, teachers and the media to educate the children and save them from this grave trend, he added.

Boost for Lanka-Russia ties
The current State visit to Russia by President Maithripala Sirisena is significant in many ways. This is the first State visit to Russia by a Sri Lankan leader in more than four decades. The last Sri Lankan leader to pay a State visit to Russia was Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1974.
Incidentally it was during her husband the late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes tenure that Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties with the then Soviet Union. Ever since, the two countries have had excellent diplomatic, trade, cultural and educational relations. However, actual Russia-Sri Lanka ties go back to the 1840s  records indicate that Russias Count Saltykov visited Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, twice - in 1841 and in 1845-46. He wrote a book detailing what he saw in Sri Lanka. A Russian consulate was established in Galle in 1891. Well-known Russian writers Anton Chekhov and Ivan Bunin also visited Ceylon. The island was also visited incognito by Russian Crown Prince (tzesarevich) during his round-the-world travels.
Russia has been a close ally of Sri Lanka at all times, regardless of which party was in power in either country. The two countries have worked together closely at the UN and other world forums. Russia took Sri Lankas side whenever unfavourable resolutions were brought against Sri Lanka at the United Nations or other world forums. Russia steadfastly helped Sri Lanka in its battle against LTTE terror.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has been cited as the worlds most powerful man by many prestigious publications. Putin has added a new level of dynamism to the Russian Presidency and once again made Russia a major player on the world stage. President Maithripala Sirisena too is held in high esteem by the International Community for his commitment to peace and mutual co-existence. Thus the meeting between the two Presidents is likely to be very productive. Sri Lanka also has a firm friend in Sergey Lavrov, the Russian Foreign Minister, who speaks fluent Sinhalese having worked at the Soviet Embassy in Colombo for a long period.
During the Presidents visit, the two countries will enter into several new Agreements and Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) to expand bilateral cooperation in several fields such as energy, trade and commerce, agriculture, education, judiciary and defence. Energy, agriculture and education are vital since they have the potential to make a difference for our future. The visit is expected to strengthen friendship and cooperation further and enhance bilateral trade between two countries, the Sri Lanka government has said.
The Soviet Union and after its break-up, Russia assisted Sri Lanka to become economically stronger in several ways. It gave 100 percent scholarships for Sri Lankan students to study at leading Russian universities, which was a turning point in our education annals. Russian literature, translated into Sinhala and English, enriched young Sri Lankan minds. The Russian Cultural Centre in Colombo gives an opportunity for Sri Lankans to get closer to Russia through Russian cultural performances and other events. Russia assisted Sri Lanka in constructing of the metallurgical plant in Oruwela, the tyre-producing plant in Kelaniya and milling and house construction plant which helped the national economy. Russia has also assisted in Sri Lankas oil exploration efforts in the 1970s.
Sri Lanka-Russia trade links remain healthy, though there is a lot more room for improvement. Tea comes to mind when one mentions Russia and indeed, the country is one of the biggest buyers of Pure Ceylon Tea. Russia used to buy more than 30 percent of the Ceylon Tea output. Other main export products to Russia include apparel, industrial and surgical gloves, aircraft components, desiccated coconut, activated carbon, discharge lamps, coir fiber and coir products, pneumatic and retreated rubber tyres and tubes. The main imports from Russia to Sri Lanka are base metal products, paper and paper products, non-metallic mineral products, chemicals and plastic products, electrical and electronic products, parts and machinery woven fabrics.
While improving trade is essential, more attention should be focused on people-to people contact. Russia has climbed several steps in the inbound tourism market with thousands more Russian tourists discovering the allure of this island. But there is one significant lacuna  Aeroflot has scrapped direct flights between Colombo and Moscow that began way back in 1965.
There is an urgent need for the reestablishment of direct airlinks between the two capitals. This should not be difficult, since Russian flag carrier Aeroflot still operates to nearby Male in the Maldives and a stop in Colombo can be slotted in, possibly with fifth freedom rights. This will lead to a boom in travel between the two nations, as many Sri Lankans are also discovering Russia as an emerging destination.
One newspaper article on the Sri Lankan Presidents visit to Russia described Russia as an all-weather friend. This is indeed an apt description of a country and a people who always stood by Sri Lanka, whatever political storms swirled outside. Thus President Sirisenas landmark State visit to Russia and bilateral talks with President Putin will help augment that very special relationship that has stood the test of time.

Can this $199 device stop club tennis cheats
LONDON: It's in!"
"No, it was most definitely out."
It's a scene played out daily on tennis courts the world over.
Although pros have had electronic line calling during matches since 2004, club players and juniors can now buy their own device for roughly the same price as a new tennis racket.
The $199 In/Out promises to put a stop to those endless discussions about line calls once and for all.
The device is the brainchild of French inventor Grgoire Gentil, who spent two years developing it in his living room in Palo Alto, California.
"Detecting the lines of a tennis court is like detecting the lines of the road in the Tesla," Gentil said in an email exchange with CNN.
Arguments
His device, which is the size of a small camera and will be available this summer, can be set up in less than a minute on top of the net post. It provides real-time line calls.
"I'm an inventor and I understand electronics," said Gentil, an avid tennis player who learned to play on red clay during his youth in Paris.
Although the ball leaves a mark on clay, arguments over which mark is the right one first gave him the idea for the In/Out device.
"I'm aware of the progress of computer vision for the self-driving car," he said.
"I knew that it was possible to apply the 'same' algorithms to sports."
Hawk-Eye, PlaySight
With a precision of two to three centimeters on average, In/Out may not be as accurate as Hawk-Eye and PlaySight but it doesn't come with the same hefty price tag.
The Hawk-Eye ball-tracking and challenge system, brought in by the grand slam tournaments in 2006 after a number of highly controversial line calls against current women's world No. 1 Serena Williams during the 2004 US Open, costs around $60,000 per court.
PlaySight's SmartCourt system costs up to $12,500 on an outdoor court, with an additional $500 a month for maintenance and cloud storage. It offers multi-angle, instant high-definition video review and analysis and is used by clubs and elite performance centers across the world as well as top players such as former French Open finalist Simona Halep. "I'm a tennis player and I'm aware of Hawk-Eye and PlaySight," said Gentil, who holds a Master's degree in mathematics and physics from Ecole Polytechnique in France and a Master's degree of science in engineering management from Stanford University in California.
Other sports to follow
"I have always dreamed of the same but for any player on any court at an affordable price," said Gentil, who partly funded the development of the In/Out device from a company sale to networking technology giant Cisco Systems in 2004.
Although Gentil is focusing on the market for recreational and junior tennis players, he said he's received "dozens of emails" from volleyball players. - CNN

Can blue card solve concussion issue
Yellow and red cards are used to discipline players in rugby and now one international federation is to trial a blue card to safeguard their health.
The system -- to be launched by the Australian Rugby Union and effective Saturday across grassroots competitions -- gives the referee full authority to dismiss from the pitch any player showing signs of concussion during a match.
In a game of more hits, more tackles, more carries and more collisions -- in the words of former England international Alex Corbisiero -- the recipient of a blue card will not be permitted to return to the pitch for the remainder of the match, and cannot return to rugby until they have passed tests to prove a full recovery.
Affected individuals must undertake the minimum stand down period under ARU guidelines -- 12 days for adults and 19 days for children -- before obtaining professional medical clearance.
Only then will they be able to return.
Rugbys concussion headache
Concussion is a brain injury that results from force either being directly applied to the brain, or transmitted up to the brain as a whiplash effect.
In rugby, it can follow anything from a big tackle to an innocuous fall, and can alter -- among other things -- consciousness, memory, mood, or sleep.
A player can be concussed without losing consciousness -- and indeed many such individuals express a desire to continue playing. It is there the danger arises.
Symptoms vary wildly from case to case and often take time to reveal themselves. Premature return can hamper full rehabilitation and put the player under risk of further concussions.
But even at elite level, players have been returning to the pitch despite showing clear warning signs.
George North was allowed to continue earlier this season despite losing consciousness, prompting Barry ODriscoll, a leading doctor and former international rugby player, to deem the protocol not fit for purpose.
Expansion
World Rugby CEO Brett Gosper told CNN in November that player welfare is the governing bodys No.1 priority, stressing the elite game has never been safer to play.
Whereas the average concussion assessment of a player during the 2015 Rugby World Cup was 64 seconds and done on-pitch, now the checks are far more rigorous and informed by a video review.
The blue card system represents ARUs intention to tackle the concussion problem head on across all levels of the game and could be rolled out nationwide, according to the organizations chief medical officer Warren McDonald.
Our concussion guidelines are there to ensure that everyone in our game is educated on how to manage concussion, said McDonald.
Ultimately the aim is to gather feedback from the upcoming trials and work towards rolling out the Blue Card system nationally across our grassroots competitions at both junior and senior level.
Referees will carry blue cards in the opening round matches of both junior and senior competitions this weekend, kicking off with Saturdays two scheduled first round matches in the ACTs John I Dent Cup.
There are no plans to implement the system at elite level.

CB intent on keeping inflation at mid-single digit range: Dr. Coomaraswamy
As the Central Bank yesterday tightened its monetary policy and raised its key policy rates by 25 basis points, Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said the increase was to send a strong signal that the Central Bank was intent on making sure inflation remained at the mid-single digit range.
It thus raised the policy rates effective as of yesterday (24) with Standing Deposit Facility
Rate (SDFR) being increased to 7.25 percent and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) raised to 8.75 percent. The Statutory Reserve Ratio (SRR) at 7.50 percent remains unchanged.
This is a precautionary measure to contain the build-up of adverse inflation expectations and the possible acceleration of demand side inflationary pressures through excessive monetary and credit expansion, stated the Central Bank.
These increases, according to the Governor, was also a proactive measure put forward by the Monetary Board which met on Thursday, the second time this year and signals a change in the way the Board manages inflation.
The best way to manage inflation is to manage inflationary expectations. Inflation expectations could disrupt inflation stabilising in the single digit mid-range, Dr. Coomaraswamy said and added that these interest rate increases would not have much impact on ordinary loan interests but was only a measure to curb inflation. In addition, the Governor pointed out that the tightening of monetary policy was also due to the Central Bank having to accommodate bunching up of government borrowings in the first half of this year. The rate hike, according to Dr.Coomaraswamy also remains in line with the US Federal Reserve hike in March,
We wanted to maintain the same differential to discourage any outflows and to encourage inflows,explained the Governor.
There have been considerable outflows from the government securities market in early 2017 but that trend, according to the Governor has subsided, and in March 2017, there were some marginal inflows.The Sri Lankan Rupee however has depreciated by 1.2 percent against US dollar as well as other international currencies.
By the end of 2017, the Central Bank expects GDP growth to be at 5-5.5 percent.
Central Bank, Economic Research, Additional Director Dr.Chandranath Amarasekara explained that the reasons behind the tightening of the monetary policy and recent increase in market inflation rates was due to the prevailing drought conditions as well as adjustments to the existing tax structure. There was a significant increase in imports at the start of this year due to imports of refined petroleum products given the energy requirements during the drought,the Governor said. In addition, a widening trade deficit has also been observed, in 2016, it was USD 9.1 billion compared to USD 8.4 billion in 2015. In 2017 the trend is expected to continue as expenditure on imports increased by 13.2 percent in January 2017 with earnings through exports contracting by 1.1 percent.
Tourist arrivals which did well at the end of last year, has dropped by 0.1 percent, bringing earnings through it in February 2017 to USD 338.9 million, compared to January-February 2017 where it was at USD 715.2 million.
Worker remittances on the other hand have seen a marginal improvement with January 2017 reporting an increase by 1.4 percent to USD 571.6 million. In addition the Monetary Board had also taken into account the notable achievements in fiscal operations which have resulted in overall budget deficit in 2016 declining,Dr.Amarasekara added.
We are not happy with the current growth of the economy so we dont want to choke the economy too much, said the Governor as he hoped that interest rates would remain steady in the immediate future, along with hope for the rains to arrive by at least April-May and a more positive global economy.

Central Bank Governor says: Htota deal will stimulate economy
Major plus for countrys reserves:
Good news if deal is finalised by this year:
The Central Bank has stated that the Hambantota Port deal was important to cushion and absorb possible shocks to our ailing economy.
Hambantota is a major plus for our reserves, if it does not go through, the people will have to bear difficult burdens in the second quarter of this year,Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said. The Central Bank Governor was addressing a media briefing at the Central Bank yesterday.
He added that it would be good news if the deal was finalised by this year.
The deal, according to Dr. Coomeraswamy will bring in USD 100 million at the time of signing, USD 300 million three months later and USD 700 million, six months after that.
This year at least we could get USD 400 million if the deal goes through, the Governor who is facing a difficult situation in managing the countrys dwindling foreign exchange reserves said.
The government was earlier successful in acquiring a USD 1.5 billion IMF loan last year to avoid a balance of payment crisis and this year it raised USD 1 billion in development bonds. But according to Deputy Governor, Dr.Nandalal Weerasinghe, this has not been sufficient,
The IMF money will only be given to us over a period of three years with each tranche at USD 160 million. We have already got two and we expect the third in June. But,from 2019 onwards, several international and domestic sovereign bonds are set to mature and this is a problem, said Dr.Weerasinghe.
The additional Chinese money thus will help us manage our short term liabilities using non-debt creating inflows. It will also help the Central Bank manage its foreign reserves,he added.
In 2016, the government had, according to the Central Bank managed the Budget deficit well and decreased it to 5.3 percent though the target was 5.4 percent. But come 2017, the government has USD 2.6 billion in total in debt servicing payments.
We have already paid USD 700 million of that money in the first quarter, and only has USD 1.9 billion to pay, Dr. Weerasinghe said.
This USD 1.9 billion is expected to be paid through the issuance of sovereign bonds worth USD 1.5 billion soon, the raising of a syndicate loan of USD 450 million with reasonable chance that it would go up to USD 700 million and a USD 200 million loan from the China Development Bank,
This would raise USD 2.4 billion and help us meet our obligations for the year but that is a thin margin. Any external shock, like an oil price increase will push us into crisis, Dr.Coomeraswamy said.
In addition to debt, the government also needs to increase its foreign reserves to USD 7-7.5 billion by this year, at present it lies at USD 5.1 billion,
USD 5.1 billion is not a level we are comfortable with. This is less than three months of import cover and in a highly volatility global economy and climate change, we cannot operate with reserves under three and a half months. We have to get to USD 7-7.5 billion, explained Dr.Coomeraswamy and added that ideally the economy would do better if we had foreign reserves of USD 10 billion as a bumper to meet all external shocks to the economy.
If we had the USD 1.1 billion from Hambantota, we can comfortably get to our target. No point in borrowing to pay off debt. We need non-debt creating money like the Hambantota Port to pay off domestic and external debt,the Governor said.
We have to get out of this hand-to-mouth existence, he added and said that in the mid and long term, the government would have to take measures to improve its exports and build confidence among domestic and international investors if we are to avoid living from one crisis to another.

Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said that most developed countries have experienced a downturn in their economy since 2004. The economic growth in the EU and the US are just 1 percent and 2 percent respectively, while in Japan it is only 0 percent.
More than 70 percent of our exports are channelled to the West. Therefore, when the West experiences an economic downturn, our foreign exchange earnings also go down, Gunasekara said.
Most ordinary people do not know anything about this. Today, there is a great economic and social disparity and ordinary people find it difficult to live due to this reason. But, the government has not taken any policy decision on this matter, he said . This situation will worsen in the future, specially due to the policies followed by the new US administration. The new US President has proposed an interest rate hike which has resulted in the dwindling of our foreign reserve from US$ 4.4 billion to US$ 1 billion. Accordingly, the government revenue has also fallen to 10 percent from 21 percent, Gunasekara said.
The government should also probe as to how Rs.4,000 million has been secured for an investment in a distillery in Kalkuda. The government should also probe whether any fraudulent money is being used for this hundred percent duty free project.
The government which came to power on an anti alcohol platform should not entertain this kind of idea like in the Eastern Province which has seen a 7 percent increase in alcohol consumption, Gunasekara said.

Education Ministry protects the corrupt: Union Secretary
The Education Ministry protects those who are involved in bribery, corruption and malpractices and keep mum on over 300 letters sent requesting to take action against them and prevent misusing public funds, Educational Non-Academic Employees' Union Secretary Ajithge Thilakaratne said.
Addressing the media at the Public Library in Colombo yesterday, he said the union received information before the incidents of corruption take place, but was not given an opportunity to submit the details confidentially.
Thilakaratne said some persons in the staff of the Education Minister are involved in corruption. They have taken Rs. 150,00 from each person by offering jobs at the education Ministry through fake 'appointment letters' and issuing fake circulars using fake signatures of the Education Ministry Secretary and the National School Director.
According to Thilakaratne, no action has been taken against the culprits even after the Education Ministry accepted the offences.
The fake circulars and appointments had been issued using the letter heads of the Education Ministry, he said.
Thilakaratne said the Education Ministry Secretary does not respect or obey any commission in the country. The country's law is not implemented in connection with the culprits who used fake signatures of Education Ministry officials and the letter head of the Ministry, he said.

Elections Commission Chair should decide on LG polls: Faizer
The decision to hold the Local Government election should be taken by the Elections Commission Chairman as the gazette notification regarding the demarcation of electoral boundaries is out, Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faizer Mustapha said.
The government has no intention of postponing the Local Government election though certain persons accuse that the government keeps postponing the LG polls.
However, the process of demarcating of electoral boundaries took a certain period of time, he said.
I was instructed to take measures to hold the LG polls soon by the President, he said. However, the minister said that there are a few amendments to be made to the demarcation report. The amendments will be forwarded to the Cabinet," Minister Mustapha said.
According to him, LG polls will be held in a few months after solving issues regarding the demarcation of electoral boundaries in local government wards. Around 2,000 proposals and appeals with regard to the demarcation have been considered.
"The suggestions sent by the main political parties with regard to the boundary definitions had to be considered," he said.
The minister said elections for Provincial Councils will be held on time once the terms of the Provincial Councils come to an end.
When asked by the media whether more women will be provided opportunities to contest at the LG pols, Minister Musthapa said he will receive instruction in this regard from the Attorney General within the next two weeks. He said the LG polls will be held under the new electoral system since the Local Government Act has been revised.

HR violation probe during war: Sri Lanka does not need international intervention
Sri Lanka does not require any international intervention in a probe into human rights violations during the war period, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The minister said this during an inspection tour of the new fish processing centre built by the Ceylon Fisheries Corporation on Wednesday. He was responding to a question raised by the media about his views on Sarath Weerasekara's recent request for an appointment of international judges for a panel to investigate human rights violations committed by the LTTE during the war period.
He said Sri Lanka does not want international judges or a hybrid court to conduct investigations into alleged violations since it has an independent courts network and a team of prestigious and talented local judges to conduct any such probe. He said that such an investigation if any can be conducted through a local mechanism.
Amaraweera said Sarath Weerasekara or anyone else in the Joint Opposition had not sought an opportunity to participate in the main UNHRC sessions in Geneva. Group meetings are held in about 50 rooms in the centre. Weerasekara had attended one such committee meeting rather than the main sessions. Anyone could attend those small committees because certain NGOs provide every facility including free air tickets. The government rejects the request by Weerasekara to internationalise the probe into human rights violation during the war period, the minister said.

The Inseparables the Paternotts and St. Peters College
The Paternotts and St Peters College, Bambalapitiya are almost synonymous with each other for when one talks of the sporting achievements of the school especially at cricket and rugby you cannot leave the name of Paternott out.
The Paternotts have a unique history with St Peters and what better way to introduce it than to say that Norman Paternott was the first cricket captain of the school from 1927 to 1930 and that he was also the schools first Head Prefect.
The 1968 Peterite cricket team captained by Rodney Paternott (fourth from left).
Thirty-eight years later Rodney Paternott followed in his fathers footsteps by captaining St Peters at cricket in 1968 and his younger brother Hamish at rugby in 1970. Rodney belongs to a unique sextet of Peterites who have captained the school at cricket as well as rugby.
The six in order are: Shirley Illesinghe, Percy Perera, Jayantha Fernando, Adiel Anghie, Darrel Wimlaratne and Rodney Paternott. Of this unique honours list the only surviving captain is Rodney with the rest having passed away.
I am hoping to come next year to celebrate 50 years as Peterite cricket captain, said Rodney. I captained St Peters at rugby in 1967 and cricket in 1968. We are trying to have a reunion of the 1968 cricket team. I think except for one, all the cricketers are alive, half of them are in Sri Lanka and the others in Australia.
Rodney was recently in Sri Lanka where he had come down for the celebration of the old boys global reunion more or less leading towards the countdown for the schools 100th year which falls in another five years.
The school is 95 years old and most of us may not be there for the Centenary, so we take every year as it comes, Rodney told the Daily News.
The old boys union celebrated 90 years and they had a big do. Everyday there was some function we had a reunion of the past cricketers Josephians and Peterites. I was there for the Big Match as well, it was my first Big Match since I left for Australia in 1984. Ive come to Sri Lanka many times since migrating but not during the big match. My last visit to Sri Lanka was five years ago, he said.
Rodneys immediate families are all overseas in Melbourne and when he comes to Sri Lanka he visits his cousins and relations.
Rolling back the years Rodney recalled, Darrel (Wimalaratne) and I played cricket for CCC and rugby for CH&FC. For CH I first played as fly half then moved to centre with Darrel. In the 1972 season we beat every club home and away except for the Police. We lost to them in the very first match but beat them in the return. We were the league champions but we lost the Clifford Cup final to Police.
My first captain at CH was an Englishman Morris Marrinon he was our no. 8, there was also Lorenz Pereira as fly half and late Horace Perera. My idol was John Burrows, he was magic. If I learnt anything in rugby I learnt it from watching him. A man of a few words but got what he wanted.
In my eyes Mike Cork, an Englishman who played for CH was the fastest. He was a wing three-quarter and very close to him will be Chandrishan Perera on the wing. Both guys were like lightning. Cork had no idea of rugby but he learnt it on the field. He ran in the British Empire Games. It is unfortunate that Mike and Chandrishan never played together. Mike played in 1972 and Chandrishan came about three to four years later.
While in Sri Lanka, Rodney also took time to watch a few school rugby matches.
I watched the Royal-Peterite match, Royal deserved to win because they played a better brand of rugby. The second game was Peterites playing Isipathana. The Peterites came off well. The school standards have always been high. I have not seen the club games yet. But the school standards have really gone up they will give any of the schools in Melbourne a good run, said Rodney.
Comparing the game during his time and now, Rodney said, Its become more physical, very fast and the game pattern has changed. It has improved in a lot of ways. We had a lot of open play. I was really taken up by the present school standards. The crowd factor is really fantastic.
Rodney was of the opinion that Sevens rugby suited the Lankan style of play.
We should do well with our Sevens it suits our style of play. In Sevens you cannot miss, you need to have possession and if you dont you need to tackle. Sevens is mainly about size and speed. We have speed but we dont have much of the size so you have to compensate for it by tackling.
Former Peterites get together (from left): Ranjan Rodrigo, Michael Elias, Rohan Buultjens, Tony Opata, Rodney Paternott and Russel Arnold.
Paying a visit to the Gymkhana Club (comprises CCC, CH&FC and Queens Club) Rodney was saddened by what the club had to offer today.
Its disappointing to see CH today this club meant a lot to me, it was like my second home. Every day of the week I was at CH we had a good time with the Pink Elephants (a team comprising past and present players). Its very disappointing to hear that CH rugby has declined so much. When I told some of my friends that I wanted my grandson to come and play a couple of seasons for CH, I was told not to put him at CH but at some other club, said Rodney who has two grandsons, the eldest Aaron who is 18 and plays for the seniors as half back.
Looking around the club Rodney observed that there was no past champion team photographs hanging on the walls or any past captains names on the honours board.
I hope they put them back in a prominent place and not in a corner where no one will see. You like to see your past chairmans photographs and past captains names on the board in cricket and rugby for which this club is famous for, said Rodney.
He also had another sad story to relate with regard to the club.
It is disappointing to note that we are over 150 years old and I read a magazine that had been put out for the Centenary year that does not mention the very first team that played in the Sara trophy tournament, said Rodney.
We were originally in the Donovan Andree trophy division II, then we won the Donovan Andree under Laddie Outstchoorn and we were promoted to Sara trophy division I. Dan Piachaud was the first Sara captain and in that Sara side we had Abu Fuard, Lorenz Pereira, Kevin Perera, Vernon Davidson and five Peterite captains HIK Fernando, Travis Fernando, Darrel Wimalaratne, Tony Opatha and myself. It was unique to have five Peterite captains in the first Sara side. We also had Brian Obeysekera, Tony Amith and HN de Silva. There is no mention at all about the Sri Lankans who played in the first year of the Sara side which I believe was in 1971.
Rodney played cricket for CCC only for a short period more time was spent playing rugby for CH.
Since moving to Melbourne, Rodney who is presently retired at 67 worked in a bank for about eight years, was in the public service for another eight years and later helped his son in his printing business.
He has two sons Ryan and Keith and daughter Shanika but none took to sport seriously, although his grandsons have shown the inclination to do so.

Interesting cricket is in store when traditional rivals St. Sylvester's College takes on Vidyartha College in the 27th limited overs cricket encounter at the Asgiriya Stadium. At the same venue on Sunday they will play their 5th T20 match. Their inaugural limited-over game was played in 1989, where the two schools had to share the trophy in a rain washed out game.
This game is played for a trophy in memory of S. Mediwake, the person who introduced cricket to Vidyartha. In the series two games were not played and a few games ended in no- decisions. Sylvestrians have won it the most. St. Sylvester's led by Manjula Perera should have the edge over Vidyartha College led by Ravishka Upananda.

Football, hockey clubs to meet Sports Minister
Some of the football and hockey lovers are to meet the Sports Minister and request him to give a helping hand to uplift the sport in Kandy. Football and hockey first saw the light of day in Kandy in the nineteenth century. Football was first played in Kandy among clubs in the 1930s. Today organized football is neglected at club level, the 2015 and 2016 inter-club tournaments are still to be completed.
Hockey in Kandy dates far back to 1907, when the Indian Rajput Regiment occupied the Kandy Military Barracks, the present Police grounds where St. Anthonys College students use to play with the Indians.
The first "bully-off" in Kandy was in 1907 at the Bogambara grounds when Kandy Sports Club and Industrial Schools team met. Hockey 'died' in 1909 and it was revived in the 1930s when P.T. Rajan stepped in to introduce the game to the schools and later clubs took it seriously. Today how the game is run in Kandy is unacceptable. They dont organize club tournaments but only get active a few months before the AGM.
5th week of schools rugby
Trinity won their fourth match of the season when they beat S.Thomas and brought back the Canon de Saram shield to Kandy. They remain unbeaten in the competition. Their next game is with Prince of Wales at Pallekele, which is going to be the last league game. Dharmaraja went down badly to St. Joseph's and will be playing Vidyartha the date of which has still not been fixed. St Anthonys who had no game last week will play St. Joseph's in Kandy on Sunday. Vidyartha thrashed St. Sylvester's with a half century score to win the Banda/Nilagoda trophy. Sri Sumangala who went down to Nalanda in their last game will play Royal Panadura this week.
Mahanuwara and Colombo at snooker
With the cue sport in the dustbin in Kandy at club level, it was good to see Mahanuwara and Colombo YMBA playing six snooker and three billiard matches. It was a good evening of cue sport and a large crowd was there to enjoy it.
All matches went in favour of the Colombo YMBA. Today only the YMBA is active in cue sport, clubs like Garden Club, Kandy Club have tables but no tournaments whatsoever.
Today in some clubs the cue room has become the store room to stuff empty liquor bottles and bill books. Who is to blame They become active only when it is time to renew liquor licenses.
Kandys rugby lovers say well done to the ladies

Kandy Police division top athletes
Kandy police will be represented by a strong 45 member mens and womens athletic team for the inter police athletic meet which takes place from 31 of March to 2 April at Police Park. Kandy police will present two top teams, where some of the top athletes from the division are in the team. The sporting DIG and SSP Division, E.M. Mahinda Ekanayake and Edmund Mahendera have given their best and now its up to the participants to do well. The mens team will be led by SI C.N.J. Galappathy and the womens by IP W.K. Anurudika.
Good cricket news
Kandy District cricket XI did a good bit of batting and bowling to beat Nuwara Eliya District XI by 96 runs in their inter-district limited overs game played at Braybrooke Place. Kandy scored 209 in 43 overs with Dimuth Karunaratne scoring an unbeaten 110. Ravindu Gunasekra bowled well to take four wickets.

Lloyd Paternott 50 years of Cambrian captaincy
Former Prince of Wales College cricket captain, Ceylon Combined Schools and Sri Lanka Air Force, Negombo Sports Club, Oman Air Force and Singha Cricket Club Oman cricketer Lloyd Paternott will be celebrating fifty years of his captaincy at his alma mater. Paternott played from 1964 to 1967 and captained the school in his final year before joining the then Royal Ceylon Air Force. Paternott met up with the Daily News at his residence at Katunayake.
Q:What is your full name and date of birth and your native place
A - Lloyd Allan Paternott. I was born on 20th October 1947 and I hail from Katubedde, Moratuwa.
Q:What is your first school, the Principal and your first class teacher
A - I had my entire education at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa from Lower Kindergarten to Advanced Level and this period the Principal was J. B. C. Rodrigo. My first class teacher was Mrs. Dorris Mendis.
Q: How did you commence your cricket career
A - Moratuwites are famous for cricket from my smaller days I played softball cricket with my neighbouring friends and at school too with my classmates. During that period there was no organized Junior Schools cricket in our country and most of the schools played a few friendly matches in the under 12, 14, 16 and 2nd eleven.
Q:Did you attend for cricket practices
A - No. I had two younger brothers at the same school and my father was very strict on us and he wanted us to study well so I did not attend under 12 practices. But when I was under 14 my classmate (later wicket keeper, opening bat for our college, Moratuwa Sports Club, Colts Cricket Club and Mercantile Services) Srinath Silva was captaining the Gunawardene House team and he took me to play in the under 14 Inter House Matches. Our House did well and came to the finals where we beat Lewis House. I took 8 wickets for 14 runs. Our Prefect of Games K. W. Dharmapala noticed my performances and he asked me to come for under 14 practices. The same year I played under Priyananda Perera and in the following two years I played under Vernon de Mel and Priyananda. I batted left-hand and bowled left-arm leg-spin.
Q: Did you play for the First Eleven
A - Yes. From 1964 to 1967. My first captain was Priyananda then Nihal Sannasgala followed by Leslie de Silva and in 1967 I captained the team and I played in four big matches and my opposite number was Maxwell de Silva. During my cricket career at school I have taken more than 150 wickets. Against Zahira College I captured 8 wickets for 50 which is still a record for our school against them.
I represented Moratuwa Schools cricket team and played at De Soysa Park against the visiting Indian Schools cricket team and I took 5 for 25. My first wicket was Surendra Amarnath who later went on to play for India. I got him out with my first ball.
Q: Did you play for Ceylon Combined Schools
A - Yes in 1967 I played against the visiting under 19 England Schools team at the Colombo Oval and my captain was Thomian Priyantha Rajapakse. To mention a few other members were Polycarp Wijesekara, Peter de Neise, Glen Vanculenberg, Tony Appadurai and Kumar Ramanathan.
Then from college I joined the Royal Ceylon Air Force the same year and I was able to complete a double that year by captaining my alma mater and getting into the Air Force.
Q: Did you play for the Air Force
A - Yes. I served in the Air Force for twelve years from 1967 to 1979 and during this period I played for the Air Force in Sara Trophy, Donovan Andree Trophy and the Daily News Trophy. Those are the three major cricket tournaments during that period. I toured Gan Islands with the Air Force team.
I could not play for the Combined Services but I was in the pool. During my Air Force career some of my team mates were Keerthi Caldera, Hemasiri Hettige, E. G. Hamilton, Hemasiri Fernando, Dr. Cyril Ernest, Dr. Nihal Gurusinghe, Ranjan Samarasinghe, Ajith Jayasekara, Mohamed Faleel, Anura Vithanachchi, Leslie Ratnapulli, Nimal Cooray, Wilfred Basnayake, Charlie Amrasinghe, S. Dharmaraja, Sarath Fernando, Bandula Tennakoon, Nihal Soysa, S. Jebarajah, Tony Opatha, Brian Obeysekara, Sarath Soysa, D.D.P. Alwis, Dilwin Mendis and several others.
Q: After leaving Air Force did you play club cricket
A - Yes. I played for Negombo Sports Club in Donavan Andree and after that in 1981 I got an appointment it the Oman Defense and served for sixteen years.
Q: Did you play cricket for Oman Defense
A - Yes. I played for Oman Air Force team and Oman Singha Cricket Club for several years. I captained the team in 1997/1998 season and won the B Division Championship and I was awarded the Best Bowlers Trophy and in 1985 also I got the Best Bowlers Trophy in the same tournament. Among my friends I am known as Patta and over there in Oman they called me Ever Green.
Q: What are the other sports you did at school
A - During our time football too was popular as cricket in our school and I played for the first eleven team in 1966 and 1967 and awarded colours. I did athletics in the inter house sports meets and I represented the school in 400 yards and 4x440 yards relay team.
My captain was one time Decathlon champion Ranjith Perera and we were sent for public schools. But I could not do well. I won school colours for athletics too.
Q:Who were the best cricketers you came across during your school and club cricket careers
A - No doubt best batsman was Anura Tennekoon and the best bowler was Barney Reid. At club level I have played with and against very good cricketers of that time. In the Air Force Keerthi Caldera is a class batsman and the best bowler was K. M. Nelson the most dependable batsman was former Sebs and evergreen Norbet Fernando, Sarath Fernando and Dilwin Mendis were the best all-rounders. Sarath was a fast bowler and you are a spinner.
I can remember you won the Best All Rounders prize for about three or four times.
I will give my vote to you. I should mention about Srinath Silva he is a very fine hitter of the ball on any wicket.
I should mention that my father though he was against my playing cricket earlier in my career when I played for college he never missed a match.
Q: What is the advice you can give to young Cambrian cricketers
A - Present day cricket is a different game and now it is commercialized. There were no inter school tournaments during our time and all were friendly games.
Present day you have to play very seriously. When you are inside the rope you forget everything and concentrate on the game.
Dont under estimate any school team because they are all very good sides. Also dont neglect your studies at any cost.
Finally I remember my College, Air Force and all other cricketers who have played with me and against with gratitude. God Bless Prince of Wales College.

Most union leaders responsible for fraud, monetary corruption: Ports Minister Ranathunga
Most of the Colombo Port's Union leaders are responsible for the financial irregularities and frauds and monetary corruptions, said Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranathunga. These union leaders who crows loudly that they stand for the protection of the Colombo Port, have been engaging in various frauds and corruption relating to the port. Minister Ranathunga said so while addressing a batch of new security officers at their passing out ceremony yesterday.
The Minister said the country should be protected from people who ruin and destroy the country. If we wish to make a better country for the future generation, we should render a honest service to the country and to the place where we work, the Minister added. He further said that there was a saying that when a honest person enters the port as a new employee, he or she would become a corrupt person within a month. However, there was a truth in that since there was such an environment. Anyhow, the current management could change that situation and there is no such situation within the Port premises. I dont say that we could obtain our targets totally, but we could make a clear picture for the port. Under the moves taken towards stopping fraud and corruption, we could minimize them drastically. It is a significant achievement in my life, the minister said. I dont say that there arent thieves in the country today. Thieves are there even today. But there should be a mechanism to protect the country from these thieves. Or else, the country could not be driven forward, Minister Ranathunga added.

New Landmark in Bilateral relations between Russaia and Sri Lanka
Relations between Sri Lanka and Russia took to greater heights with President Maithripala Sirisenas historical visit to Moscow at the invitation of his Russian counterpart Vladmir Putin.
His visit marked the first State visit by a Sri Lankan Head of State to Moscow after a lapse of 40 years.
Former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaikes visit to Russia in 1974 cemented more closer ties in the field of economy, trade, tourism and technical cooperation. The then Soviet Union set up the Steel factory in Oruwala, tyre and tube factory in Kelaniya, four milling plants and a grain elevator in Trincomalee and the Sugar-cane plantation at Kantale. They are the symbols of sound relations between the two nations.
It was the then Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike government that recognized the Soviet Union and established diplomatic relations. President Maithripala Sirisena who arrived at Domodedovo International Airport received a warm welcome from the Russian officials.
The visiting president was received by Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Igor Morgulov. Russian President Vladimir Putin pledged to enhance long term economic cooperation and affirmed to build a strong foundation to take bilateral relations to a net height when he met Sri Lankan President Maithripala at Kremlin on Thursday evening.
The Sri Lankan delegation led by President Maithripala Sirisena participated in a special ceremony to mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations.

Condolence Motion on Late Premier Wickramanayake: He was a key figure from 1960 to 2015: PM
Parliament yesterday, expressed condolences on the demise of former Prime Minister late Ratnasiri Wickramanayake.
The Vote of Condolence was moved by Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Party leaders, while members on both sides of the House joined in.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe speaking at the condolence motion said, Late Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka was a key political figure from 1960 - 2015. Over these 55 years, there had been many transformations in Sri Lankan politics and Wickramanayaka could well adapt to these changes. He won the confidence of both ex-Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga, which made him special.
Despite his political affiliations, we were always friends. There may be different political views, but we must have the ability to work together. I saw in the You Tube how UK Parliamentarians acted in unity during the terrorist attack in front of the UK Parliament. This is how the Commonwealth Parliamentary system works, he added.
He always maintained dignity of Parliament - Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R Sampanthan joining in the condolence vote said that late Wickramanayake was not a person who used communalism or chauvinism to promote himself to politics.
I valued my interactions with him because I always felt that I was interacting with a person who had very clear and strong views, but at the same time, those were very modest views.
He was firmly of the view that this country should be undivided, indivisible and united, but also held the view that all the people in this country must be able to live with equality and justice.
He was very careful to maintain the highest decorum and dignity of this House and never did anything that would reduce this august assembly to a common market place. He was not noisy, arrogant and aggressive, he commented.
He was no racist, but had a nationalist feeling - MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said, Late Wickramanayake entered Parliament representing the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP). He was no racist, but had a nationalist feeling. He was an advocate on the unitary character of the state. He came forward to advise us at needy times and we were ready to listen to him. He was a humble politician and a good example to the new comers. Former President Rajapaksa concluded his speech expressing his well-wishes to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for his birthday which coincidentally fell on the same day.
Parliament decided to continue the condolence motion on another date as the Leader of the House informed that many other members, including President Maithripala Sirisena were willing to speak on it.
Speaker advises MPs to avoid disgracing Supreme body
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya making a special announcement in Parliament yesterday, advised the MPs to stick to the subject that was being debated in the House and not to insult or level unsubstantiated allegations against fellow members.
He made this observation making special reference to the Parliamentary debate of March 22, when the House took up a motion relating to the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC). The Speaker pointed out that certain MPs who spoke during this debate resorted to insult the Prime Minister and other fellow MPs with unfair, false and baseless allegations.
He said this behaviour was a disgrace and disrepute to the Supreme body, adding that it was a clear violation of the Standing Orders. He said he raised this matter with the relevant MPs by summoning them.
Documents destroyed due to departmental order, natural calamities:Media Minister
Parliament was yesterday informed that data on ethnic commotion in July and August 1983 are currently not available in most of the Police divisions in the country.
This was stated in an answer tabled by Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathileka in response to a question by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila asking to state the number of Sinhalese persons who died, injured or got displaced in the 1983 ethnic conflict.
According to the answer, the documents had perished 33 years ago, following the occurrence of the incident.
According to the answer, some documents had been destroyed as per a Departmental Order, while terrorist attacks and natural calamities such as the Tsunami disaster and flooding, which also had led to the destruction of documents. The data was not available also because some complaints related to the 1983 incident had not been reported to Police stations and as there had been no proper restoration of documents at Police stations due to the war situation.

President signs special gazette notification: Declaring four forests near Wilpattu North Sanctuary as Conservation forests
All forests located near the Wilpattu North Sanctuary belonging to the Department of Forest Conservation will be declared as one Reserve.
Accordingly, President Mahripala Sirisena, who is on a three day official visit to Russia, signed the Special Gazette Notification in Moscow yesterday ,declaring Mavillu, Weppal, Karadikkuli, Marichchikadi and Vilaththikulam forests as the Mawillu Forest Reserve under 3A of the Forest Conservation Ordinance.
If there is any necessity to make variation of limits of conservation forest only the Minister may by Order published in the Gazette, declare that the limits of any conservation forest shall be altered or varied. An Order made by the Minister under Subsection (1) will have no effect until it has been approved by the President and confirmed by Parliament and notification of such confirmation is published in the Gazette.
Consequently, the conservation forest will get the maximum legal coverage and the protection in this regard will be ensured.
Recently, several media organisations made allegations that deforestation is taking place in the Wilpattu National Park as well as in the surrounding forests.
Even though such allegations were made, investigations carried out in this regard revealed that there was no deforestation taking place, except in lands given for resettlement purposes in 2012/2013.
During the meeting held on December 30, 2016 under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena on this issue, the President has given instructions to issue a Gazette Notification to declare the forests near the released land area as conservation forest to ensure the protection of these forests.

Ravi on sudden inspection tour at Customs
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake went on an urgent inspection tour at the Sri Lanka Customs yesterday midnight.
The Minister inspected the two container yards at Orugodawatta and the Customs Headquarters. The ministry had received many complaints that the functions of the department are slow and that triggered the need for an urgent inspection tour. Another objective of the tour is to ascertain whether the Customs operations are carried out systematically round the clock.
The Customs officials at the container yard were surprised by the ministers unexpected visit. The minister also engaged in a conversation with the representatives of importers to release their containers. Speaking to the representatives, the minister asked them to educate him if there is any delay.
The minister discussed the problems faced by the Customs officers in discharging their duties.
He specially looked into the online system introduced to facilitate the release of imported goods. Minister Karunanayake, who enquired the process of releasing containers to their owners since they reach the port, also enquired about the illegal import of cigarettes reported by the media recently.
Customs Director General Chulananda Perera told the minister the officials were surprised to find only some furniture inside the particular container.
The Minister met some officers engaged in night duty and appreciated their hard work.
We came to know by importers that there is a delay in Customs process. Consequently, we chose to engage in an inspection tour at slack time of this nature. We observed that the Customs is processing very well. However, certain things should be updated. Import and export activities are carried out within 24 hours in other countries.
Our Customs is similarly engaged in such work schedules but services of Wharf clerks are not up to the expectation due to certain disputed circumstances, the minister said.
The Customs Director General said the services rendered by Customs officers should be lauded. He said the visit by the minister to witness their hard work in this dead night is an attempt to appreciate their inestimable services. He also commended the minister for his visit and said the tiring efforts being taken by the minister irrespective of day and night would demonstrate the whole country of his commitment and dedication to his duty.

The Sri Lanka Telecom PLC has filed a writ petition in the Court of Appeal against the inaction on the part of the police to take legal action to prevent the continuing unlawful activities by the employees of SLT Human Capital Solutions (Pvt) Ltd in front of the SLT headquarters.
When the petition came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah, the respondent including the Fort police were directed to give police complaints made by SLT.
The petitioner stated that from time to time, the employees of Human Capital Solutions (HCS) have purported to agitate to be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the petitioner. On or about December 26,2016, the All Ceylon Telecommunication Employees Union launched a purported trade union action demanding that the employees of HCS be absorbed into the permanent cadre of the petitioner.
The petitioner stated that the protests were being done in a manner which was highly obstructive to the public, especially the users of the payments and the petitioner issued an order under section 106(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
The petitioner has cited the OIC of the Fort Police Station, SSP Colombo Central Division, IGP Pujitha Jayasundara, SLT Human Capital and several others as respondents. The respondents were noticed to appear in Court on April 4.
Presidents Counsel Sanjeewa Jayawardena, counsel Lakshana Perera instructed by Sudath Perera Associates appeared for the petitioner.

SOME TEACHINGS OF JESUS FOR LENT SEASON: Seek and you will find
As all Christians and some Muslims around the world observe repentance during Lent that finally leads to the death of Jesus upon the cross, we all suffer from guilt being a part to the world's greatest miscarriage of Justice that is written in blood where history can never wipe Pilate's gruesome error against the innocent Jesus who two thousand plus years ago began his mission to save the world. His wholesome Ministry was filled with love, care, compassion, wisdom etc. for the humble as he went about preaching the Word of God.
Powerful but simple miracles
Let us take a look at some of them as recorded in the Holy Scriptures.
The eyes are like a lamp for the body. If your eyes are sound your whole body will be full of light but if you eyes are no good your body will be in darkness. So, if the light in you is darkness, how terribly dark it will be.
No one can be a slave to two masters. He will hate one and love the other. He will be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and man. This why I tell you not to be worried about food and drink you need in order to stay alive or about clothes for your body. After all isnt the body worth more than clothes. Look at the birds flying about. They do not sow seeds, gather a harvest and put it in the barn. Yet, your Father in heaven takes care of them. Arent you worth much more than the birds
The narrow gate
Go in through the narrow gate because the gate to hell is wide and the road that leads to it is easy and there many who travel it. But the gate to life is narrow and the way that leads to is hard and there are few people that find it. Do not judge you in the same way as you judge others and he will apply to you the same rules you apply to others.
Ask and you will receive, seek and you will find, knock and the door will be open to you.
False prophets
Be on your guard against false prophets. They come to you looking like sheep on the outside but on the inside, they are really like wild wolves. You will know them by what they do. Thorn bushes do not bear grapes and briers do not bear figs. A healthy tree bears good fruit but a poor tree bears bad fruit. So, then will know bad prophets by what they do.
When Jesus finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at the way he taught He wasnt like the teachers of the Law, instead he taught with authority. Jesus went up to the hill for rest and let people too rest.
Jesus bless little children
Some people brought little children to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and to pray for them but the disciples scolded the people. Jesus said, Let the children come to me and do not stop them because the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these. and Jesus departed on his mission.
By morning when Jesus came down from the hill a large crowd had gathered and were ready to follow him. Among them a man suffering from a dreaded skin disease, came to him, knelt before him and said, Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean. Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, and said I do want to'. At once, the man was healed from is disease. Then Jesus said to him, Listen, do not tell anyone but go straight to the priest and let him examine you. Then in order to prove everyone that you are cared, offer the sacrifice that Moses ordered.
And Jesus proceeded with people following in awe, he got into a boat with his disciples when suddenly a great storm hit the lake and the boat was in danger of sinking. Jesus was asleep. The disciples woke him. Save us lord they said, we are about to die.
Why are you so frightened Jesus answered. How little faith you have. Then he got up and ordered the winds and the waves to stop and there was great calm. Everyone was amazed. What kind f man is this they said. Even the winds and the waves obey him.
After healing two men riddled with demons in the territory of Gadara on the other side of the Lake, Jesus got into the boat once again in his own town, when some people brought him a paralysed man lying on a bed. Jesus saw how much faith they had in him and said Courage my son, your sins are forgiven'. Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, they are evil things. It is easier to forgive or to say, Get up and walk. I will prove to you then that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. So, he said Get up pick up your bed and go home'. The man got up and went home. When the people saw it, they were afraid and praised God for giving such authority to men.
A woman who had suffered severe bleeding for twelve years came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak. She said to herself, If I only touch his cloak, I will get well. Jesus turned and saw her and said, Courage my daughter, your faith had made you well. At the very moment the woman became well.
Continues healing the sick and the suffering
The Son of Man never rested. He had very little time left to love, care and cherish before he completed his mission on earth. Jesus was a young man, only thirty three-years-old and was aware of it. As Jesus left the place again, two blind men started following and shouted, Take pity on us, Son of David. When he went indoors, the two men came to him and Jesus asked them Do you believe that I can heal you. Yes, Sir they answered. Jesus touched their eyes and said, Let it happen and their sight was restored. Jesus spoke sternly to them, dont tell this to anyone but they ran spreading the miracle news. After speaking about his suffering and death, and about the Parable of the lost sheep.
The lost sheep
What do you think a man who has hundred sheep and one of them gets lost Jesus questioned He will leave the other ninety nine grazing on the hillside and go and look for the lost sheep. When he finds it, I tell you, he feels far happier over this one sheep than over the ninety nine that did not get lost. Just the same way your Father in haven does not want any of these little ones be lost.

Sri Lanka wins two year Geneva wait
The political debate in Sri Lanka will soon away from its near total involvement with Geneva and get back to the other topics of political relevance here, with Sri Lanka getting a two year extension to implement the UNHRC Resolution of October 2015, which was co-sponsored by Sri Lanka with several other countries. The extension was obtained by Sri Lanka without vote, with showed much international understanding of Sri Lankas situation, and an appreciation of the countrys position.
Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha de Silva made it clear that Sri Lanka will in this two year extension to implement the consensual Resolution 30/1 of October 2015, with patience, understanding and constant effort and perseverance seeks to make the reconciliation process in the country a success, moving towards a progressive and united society, taking the Sri Lankan nation towards new heights in socio-economic development. He re-affirmed what Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera told the UNCHR earlier at this 34 Session of the Council, when explaining the progress made by Sri Lanka in the areas of peace, unity, understanding and reconciliation, and explained the need for a two year extension to carry out the many tasks in the regard.
It is noteworthy that the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, reiterated the need for foreign judges and other legal personnel to be available for probes into any alleged war crimes in the country  both by the State forces and the LTTE - in the final stages of the war with the terrorist LTTE. Yet, the High Commissioner did admit that Sri Lanka had made considerable progress in the cause of peace, understanding and reconciliation in more than two years since the major political change that took place in the country, in January 2015.
Sri Lanka will certainly have to do more from now on with regard to action on Missing Persons during and because of that conflict, setting up of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and the better assurance of equality for all in the process of justice in the country. These are matters flowing from the original resolution of October 2015. But what obviously matters more in the local political context is the issue of foreign judges, in what has been proposed as Hybrid Courts, for transitional justice in the country, The huge echoing of Geneva in the local political debate in the past weeks, especially after Foreign Minister Samaraweeras statement at the UNHRC late last month, has been over this issue of foreign judges. The situation has certainly been made even worse with both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stating their own disagreement on the need for foreign judges, although for different reasons.
Politics of transition
The wide breather that Sri Lanka had now got of a two year extension on implementing the several matters necessary for strengthening peace and reconciliation has also given us the time to come to a final resolution of the issue of transitional justice. There is no doubt the situation has changed in the country from what it was in October 2015. The judiciary is certainly more independent.
There have been two Chief Justices appointed, based on solely seniority on the Bench. The country has certainly moved away from a period of total government control over the judiciary, as seen in the Rajapaksa period, and to an extent even before.
The issue that the Joint Opposition raises, whether Minister Mangala Samaraweera agreed to the hybrid court principle on his own, without the agreement of the President and Prime Minister has been well answered by the Foreign Minister himself, stating it was a government decision.
The voices of opposition being raised against the hybrid court, which involves foreign judges, are being met, through President Sirisenas objection to it on principle, which does come somewhat late, and Prime Minister Wickremesinghes objection on practical reasons, which makes it more realistic. What the Prime Minister says is that the appointment of foreign judges would require an amendment to the Constitution, and as such is not practical in the current context. This is certainly taken in the context of the Governments overall fears of the necessity to have a referendum to adopt a new Constitution. There is no doubt that in the current political situation with divisions within the SLFP, and the increasing rivalry between the SLFP and UNP, the government may not be able to get the two-thirds majority in parliament for such an amendment to the Constitution, even if a referendum is not required for such a change.
This understanding of the political situation, and the fact that the UNHRC cannot compel Sri Lanka to have a hybrid court, would no doubt make this call die down among the majority community, and thereby enable the government to move away from the hybrid court in the next two years, However, it will certainly have to face the harsh reality of how this will be seen by the Tamil community, which is looking for a better approach to the issues of peace understanding and reconciliation. It will certainly be the task of the government, and those among its leadership seeking to obtain big national positions in the national elections that are a head from 2019 onwards, to think of effective reconciliation, through the prevailing judiciary, with all the independence that could be shown, and also by having the courage to bring any issues of alleged war crimes before our own courts.
Back to a farce
The Joint Opposition has been pushed into an embarrassing position with the decision of its MP Wimal Weerawansa to launch a fast in the Welikada Remand Prison. He is objecting to his being held behind bars for a long period, on the issue that this prevents him from serving the people in his electorate, in the Colombo District.
It is reported that some members of JO who saw him had told him that this is not the best approach, because his being held in remand is due to decisions by the courts. In fact, he has launched his fast after the High Court rejected his petition to rescind the Colombo Magistrates Courts decision to place him under remand custody, for an offence that involves misuse of a very large amount of State funds, when he was a minister in the past government.
The people are certainly reminded of his other well known, but very foolish, shameful, and quite hilarious fast near the Office of the United Nations in Colombo, some years back. He was crunching biscuits during that fast and gave up his nonsense when President Mahinda Rajapaksa came to him with a soft drink. It certainly was not a big publicity event for the former President.
Before the latest fast was announced, the JO leader in Parliament, Dinesh Gunawardena did make a statement about opposition members who are held in remand not being able to carry out their service to the electorate. What both he and Wimal Weerawansa should understand is that service to the people does not involve fraud and criminal action, and it is the duty of an MP, who is interested in serving the people, to keep away from the offences that can lead to them being kept in custody and away from the people.
Wimal Weerawansa should be reminded that there have been criminals in the past, who did carry out fasts when in prison, and were brought to the Courts in a stretched state as weak persons, but the Courts did not take notice of such conditions in dealing with them as citizens facing the law. Weerawansa must know he is not a special person before the law, which he must have understood when he was recently not given party leader status in parliament by the Speaker. We will have to wait for the next stage of the Weerawansa drama in the stage of folly politics in Sri Lanka.
Trail of journalist killers
The new evidence placed before the Courts with regard to the assassination of Lasantha Wickramatunge, following a statement by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, certainly opens a new trail in the hunt for the killers of journalists during the Rajapaksa Regime.
Former Secretary of Defence, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, comes to the scene asking why the former Army Commander did not know what those under him were doing in the Army, during his time of command. No doubt the Courts will look into that at the proper time. However, there is no doubt the Secretary, Ministry of Defence was above the Army Commander, and it was very much so during the time of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa in that position.
What is more interesting is to see how so many persons in the Military Intelligence Service have been suspect of involvement in the abduction and possible murder of journalists at that time.
It is a matter both Rajapaksa brothers  President Mahinda and Secretary Defence Gotabhaya - will someday require to give the proper answers.

Supplementary estimate to introduce new domestic airline
A Supplementary Estimate presented to Parliament last morning revealed that the government had decided to introduce a new domestic airline.
The approval of Parliament was sought through the Supplementary Estimate to spend Rs.1.05 billion for the domestic airline which is to be set up as a public private partnership and also for the double
tracking of a railway line in the Polgahawala- Kurunegala section and the Aluthgama-Galle section. The Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry is to handle the project according to the supplementary estimate.
The Same Supplementary Estimate also sought approval to spend a sum of Rs.3.05 billion to expedite the construction of 50,000 houses, including the Northern and Eastern Provinces and Hill Country area for drug prevention and rehabilitation of drug addicts.
The money is to be spent under the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry.
Parliament approval is sought through the Supplementary Estimate to spend Rs 0.2 billion on the Matara Riverside Development project. The Money is to be allocated for the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry. The Supplementary Estimate also sought approval for a sum of Rs.850,000,000 to procure National Cyber Security System for the Ministry of Defence.
A note annexed with Estimate said that the supplementary allocations are provided strictly for the purposes specified in approved budget estimates to relevant spending agencies having carried out a need assessment, giving consideration to relevant financial regulations, and approved procedures.
The note also had it that however, this supplementary provision did not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate by Parliament. The allocation of such purposes has been made under the project of budgetary support services and contingent liabilities of the Department of National Budget and it is under the limit of the approved annual budget. It also said that due to this reason either the burrowing limit or the maximum limit of total expenditure will not be increased due to granting of these supplementary provisions.

Three-match ODI commences at Dambulla today : Selections get curiouser and curiouser
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will commence their seventh bilateral One-Day International series at Rangiri Dambulla Stadium under lights today with the visitors hoping to carry their historic maiden Test win into the fifty-over format.
Of the six ODI series played between the two countries Sri Lanka have been dominant winning five of them and drawing one. The last series played in Bangladesh in February 2014 resulted in Sri Lanka winning 3-0. However since June 2014 Bangladeshs approach to one day internationals has changed a great deal following the advent of former Sri Lanka cricketer cum coach Chandika Hathurusingha taking over as head coach.
Bangladesh are a far stronger and better one-day side than they were at one time. This was proved in what could be called their golden run of 12 wins in 15 ODIs from the 2015 Cricket World Cup where they qualified for the quarterfinals for the first time.
Although they have lost their last two ODI series to England (1-2) at home and (0-3) in New Zealand, they are certainly a handful to reckon with especially against a Sri Lankan unit that is unsettled and looking for consistency.
Sri Lanka will miss the services of two hard hitters of the leather Kusal Perera who is out with a hamstring injury and Niroshan Dickwella serving a two-match suspension imposed by ICC for showing dissent at an umpires decision during a T20I against Australia in Geelong. Dickwella has already missed the final T20 game against Australia at Adelaide and todays game will be his second.
Apart from winning the one-day tri-nation in Zimbabwe last November Sri Lanka have notched up only one win in their last 15 bilateral ODIs against England, Australia and South Africa.
They have a lot to prove to get back to be a consistently winning unit. This series against Bangladesh will be their last before they participate in the ICC Champions trophy in England where they have a tough group to contend with in the likes of South Africa, India and Pakistan.
What is so glaring exposed with the Sri Lankan squad selected for the first two ODIs at Dambulla is the lack of a specialist off-spinner when one considers that Bangladesh have at least five top order left-hand batters in their ranks.
Instead what do we have Two left-arm spinners (Sachith Pathirana and Lakshan Sandakan), a right-arm leg-spinner (Seekkuge Prasanna) with Dhananjaya de Silva and Dhanushka Gunathilaka as two part-time off-spinners who are expected to bowl during the 30 power play overs where only four fielders are allowed outside the 30-yard circle. To make matters worse Gunathilaka has a cloud hanging over his bowling action.
Doesn't such major shortcoming throw into question the very foundation on which teams are picked and the integrity of the selection process
In such circumstances the professionalism and credentials not only of the local staff but also the foreign coaching staff needs to be brought into question the way things are happening today. Did any one of these key personnel in the Sri Lankan support staff bother to study the composition of the Bangladeshi side Or were they fast asleep in a happy fat cat slumber of complacency when it is the pride of a nation that is being tarnished due to their ignorance and incompetence.
On the other side of the coin Bangladesh have lately included their prolific off-spinner Mehedi Hasan into their squad to counter the threat the Lankan left-hand batsmen would pose.
A news agency report quoting Bangladesh chairnan of selectors: Chief selector Minhajul Abedin said team management felt an off-spinner would work against Sri Lankas left-handed batsmen in the ODI series opener in Dambulla on Saturday. The composition of the Sri Lanka team suggested that we would need an extra off-spinner in the series, Abedin was quoted as saying.
As Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland selections are getting curioser and curioser.

UN fears 200 died in coalition airstrike on Mosul

The United Nations has raised grave concerns about reports of high civilian casualties in the Iraqi city of Mosul.
A senior UN official in Iraq said she was stunned by accounts of "terrible loss of life", after claims that at least 200 people had been killed in an air strike by the US-led coalition.
US warplanes are supporting the Iraqi Army's mission to retake Mosul from the Islamic State (IS).
US media reportssay an investigation is under way.
It is not known exactly when the deaths are alleged to have happened.
However, reporters in western Mosul's Jadideh neighbourhood said they saw 50 bodies being pulled out of buildings on Friday, after they were razed in air attacks earlier in March.
Iraqi forces have been waging a months-long offensive to recapture Mosul, the last IS stronghold in Iraq, which has been occupied since 2014.
The New York Times quoted US military officials saying the coalition was investigating reports of civilian deaths from a strike between 17-23 Marc.
Colonel Joseph Scrocca, a spokesman for the US-led command in Baghdad, said that "the coalition has opened a formal civilian casualty credibility assessment on this allegation" from Mosul.
"This process takes time, though, especially when the date of the alleged strike is in question," he said.
The UN estimates that 400,000 Iraqi civilians are trapped in the Old City of Mosul as government forces battle to re-capture it.
More than 180,000 civilians have fled the west of the city in the past month, amid fears that an additional 320,000 may follow in the coming weeks.
Residents who have managed to flee say the militants are using civilians as human shields, hiding in houses and forcing young men to fight.
US officials believe there are about 2,000 IS fighters left in Mosul.

Unmet challenges
The Mahinda group points out that Human Rights Chief Prince Hussein states in his report: The failure to show progress in the above-mentioned cases only strengthens the case for the establishment of a specialized court to deal with system crimes, staffed by specialized personnel and supported by international practitioners. With crocodile tears they claim the statement indicates that the government has been caught in a trap in respect of foreign participation due to the circumstances that had led to slow progress.
The Joint Opposition is like a bull caught in a corner, goes round and round repeating the same statement. But the disruption and uproar, it is creating are not just abuse without strategy. Racial intolerance and religious extremism, the fascistic mix, is an aged old tested instrument for this purpose. The purpose is not hidden; it is frankly declared, flaunted and avowed: Bring chaos and violent conflicts and prepare the stage for a conspiracy to bring down the government by within this year.
Of course; they are not in a hurry to take over; they know the blacklash of a false step could be disaster for the fascistic hooligans far beyond bourgeoisie democracy.
Geneva episode
Hence we can look into what happened at Geneva. This Geneva episode, some say is harmful to the country, with many different representations being made at the 34th session of UNHRC. However it is interesting to note a resolution co-sponsored by Lanka, are being intervened separately on behalf of different national minorities, women and a delegation on behalf of the armed forces. Coming from a free country it doesnt look like washing the dirty linen in public.
On the contrary it shows that the government remains democratic and even though steps are taken to release the woes of the citizens, they are given the freedom to appeal to world authority. The government delegation could have adequately represented the interests of all these groups in Geneva before co-sponsoring the resolution for its citizens. But in the free society there is a difference under the new government. There is certainly a willingness to address each issue in full; gone are the days when activists lobbying in Geneva for the rights of all Lankans, whatever their national origin were threaten by the state forces. This transparency and freedom of expression is surely one of the reasons why Geneva is softer on the Lankan government today, compared with that fascistic past.
Needless to say, that the Government has the right to reject a recommendation by the UNHRC or its head. All resolutions and promises can be postponed or kept away even if those do not conflict with the constitution. If Hybrid Court suggestion is neglected, it will create a negative image among minority communities.
Here the government is rejecting one of its commitments under a resolution adopted in the worlds human rights body, with its own co-sponsorship, without any alternative to remove the fears of Sinhala hegemony in the judicial system.
When President Maithripala Sirisena says that former Chief Justice pleaded before him to extend latters term, promising to give judgements according to the wishes of the president; we have to agree that judicial system has been terribly degenerated. Obviously Chief Justice could not give such a degraded assurance unless he has the backing of a powerful network within the judicial system. We know that progressive sections within the judiciary joined the democratic uprising and there were changes made in the recent period. Were these enough to break the Sinhala hegemonistic interventions and sweep out the decadence brought in by the Mahinda Chinthanaya
Prosecute and punish perpetrators
The Human Rights High Commissioner has referred to several famous cases which he calls as emblematic cases such as the murder of prisoners at the Welikada prison in 2012, killing of protesters by Army personnel at Rathupaswela in August 2013, killing of five students and 17 NGO workers in Trincomalee in 2006, the Kumarapuram massacre and disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda. Though inquiries are made, still culprits are not exposed. Many fingers are directed at the former Defence Secretary; he has not been charged for any such offence. Does the lack of decisive progress in the above-mentioned serious well publicized cases reflect a lack of capacity or willingness of the State to prosecute and punish perpetrators of serious offences when they are linked to security forces This appears to be a challenge to the assurance Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera gave at the UNHRC in 2015 in the form of a request, dont judge us by the broken promises, experiences and u-turns of the past.
The failure to show progress in the above-mentioned cases only strengthens the case for the establishment of a specialized court to deal with crimes originated within the system, including defence forces. There should be a pool staffed by specialized personnel and supported by international judicial organisations. If the pool consists local judges with a Sinhala minority, then it may counter the suspicion of Sinhala hegemony. There was no attempt to mobilize non Sinhala reputed judges in these problematic cases.
This indicates that the government has been caught in a trap in respect of foreign participation due to the circumstances that had led to slow progress and lack of consciousness about the problem faced. Yes, Yahapalanaya continuously blunders; Ministers are at cross-purposes, a day does not pass without some Minister flatly contradicting another. People are expected to tolerate these anomalies as this is joint operation of traditionally hostile parties.
This is exactly the problem; fascistic rubbish accumulated in the past has to be crushed and swept out to create a democratic constitution. Those who accept this challenge should come out and fight; not to miss this chance!

Zahira edged out by Avishka Lee's spectacular penalty
A spectacular 35-metre touch line penalty put over by scrum half Avishka Lee enabled Wesley College to beat Zahira College by 32 points (4 tries, 3 conversions, 2 penalties) to 29 (4 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Singer A division inter-schools league rugby first round match played at Longden Place yesterday. Zahira led 15-10 at half time.
Wesley dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a torrid time to Zahira with their three quarters with the help and guidance of their newly appointed coaching staff of New Zealander Paul Toia, Dulanjana Wijesinghe and Mohamad Sheriff right through the entire match. This really made the difference for Wesley to pull this game off in their favour.
Zahira went into the lead with winger Uzran Lantra scoring two tries and fly half Said Sinhawansa converting one of them and following up with a penalty. Wesley cut down the lead with a try scored by hooker Zain Doole. Lee converted the try and also put over a penalty just before half time.
