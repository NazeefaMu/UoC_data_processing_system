LRC, a people-friendly institution
The Land Reform Commission (LRC), which had bribery and corruption allegations for a long period, is now converted to a people-friendly institution, Land Reforms Commission Chairman Dr. Sampath Subasinghe Arachchi told the Daily News.
The Land Reform Law of 1972 deprived agriculture land to owners of above 50 acres of highland and 25 acres of paddy cultivation.
Under the Land Reform Law, a legendary national leader, the late Land Minister Hector Kobbekaduwa, was instrumental in establishing the Land Reform Commission, acquiring land above the ceiling and redistributing agricultural land to landless farmer families to transform the agriculture sector for national prosperity.
The role of the Land Reform Commission, for over 45 years, was under the provisions of the Land Reform Act amended from time to time by policy decisions taken by governments from time to time.
Under the leadership of Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, the present management would be able to acquire large extents of land distributed illegally and decision were taken to provide these lands to the Industries and Commerce Ministry for the establishment of industrial zones.
The minister has directed us to take disciplinary action against those found guilty of corruption and six officers, found to be involved in bribery and corruption, were interdicted, he said.
The release of statutory obligations of land owners and payment of compensation to them, the utilization of lands which have been vested in productive investments and the collection of revenue of the Commission, protection of lands, training of staff and welfare are the priorities of the Commission, he said.
The LRC is a self-funded body and providing land for investors. Taxes collected from investment projects and the mineral taxes are the main sources of income of the LRC. We have been able to stop unauthorized stone quarrying and sand mining practiced in the country, he added.
After Minister Karunathilaka became the Lands Minister in June 2017, several steps were taken to enhance the efficiency of the LRC services and make the institution a profitable venture.
The number of deeds distributed during six months was higher than the deeds issued during the past five years.
The Commission is also conducting a programme to release lands for families who do not have a single inch of land, he said.
He added that the Land Reform Commission is entrusted with the National Programme for the allocation of one million land deeds.
An accelerated programme of distributing one million permanent deeds for families settled in the lands of the Land Reform Commission is implemented under the guidance of Minister Karunathilake, fulfilling an election pledge of the President and the Prime Minister.
The Chairman said it was useless keeping high fertile agricultural lands under the LRC without making use of them and he proposed to distribute plots of land among unemployed youths willing to be agricultural entrepreneurs.

SAITM students told to pay kdu Rs 1.3 mn per year
SAITM students who are to be absorbed to the Kotelawela Defence University (KDU) have been asked to pay Rs 1.3 million per year, JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa said.
He pointed out this was unfair as these students had been paying money to SAITM for many years. He made this comment while moving a private members motion in Parliament yesterday.
When we passed the legislation to give effect to the transfer of the SAITM students, there was no mentioning of payment of money to the KDU. The transfers must be done free of charge, he said.
UNP MP Prof. Ashu Marasinghe joining in the same debate said even the students who received free scholarships from the SAITM have been asked to pay money when transferred to the KDU.
He requested Government intervention to settle this matter.

Sri Lanka should march forward as a technologically-equipped society, Science, Technology, Research, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Sarath Amunugama said.
He was addressing the 13th International Conference on Computer Science and Education, held in Colombo on Thursday.
The conference was held in several countries in the past, including Sri Lanka, for the last 12 years.
"The development of human resources is vital, if Sri Lanka is to take advantage of growth opportunities emerging in the near future," said the minister.
He added that knowledge in information technology is significant in human resource development.
"Considering the progress in the southern parts of India at present, Sri Lanka could, in the future, jointly build an international technology zone with them," he added.

Anderson strikes as India collapse to 15-3 in between Lords showers
LONDON Friday: India slumped to 15 for three either side of two rain breaks at tea on the second day of the second Test against England at Lord's on Friday.
Rain, which washed out the whole of Thursday's play without a ball bowled, meant just 40 minutes' cricket had so far taken place on the second day.
But that did not stop India losing three top-order wickets in a mere 8.3 overs.
James Anderson took two for five in 15 balls before lunch, while the twelfth of 12 deliveries in the second session saw Cheteshwar Pujara run out for one by Ollie Pope.
England captain Joe Root decided to field when he won Friday's toss, with a combination of overcast skies and a green-tinged pitch making conditions ideal for swing specialist Anderson.
England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker started this match requiring just six more wickets to become the first bowler to take 100 in Tests at Lord's.
The 36-year-old Anderson needed just five balls to move nearer that landmark when, in the first over of the day, he bowled Murali Vijay for a duck with a superb late outswinger that had the batsman playing across the line to leave India none for one.
Vijay's exit brought in Pujara, recalled after India dropped struggling opener Shikhar Dhawan.
But there was nothing he could do as Anderson had KL Rahul (eight), pushing forward defensively, caught behind by wicket-keeper Jonny Bairstow off a thin edge.
Rahul might have left the delivery alone, but with Anderson operating from the Pavilion End there was always the concern that the ball might come down the slope to hit the right-hander's off-stump.
Two balls later, rain stopped play.
The last thing India needed when the match resumed in what were still difficult batting conditions was to donate a wicket to England.
Yet that was what happened.
Pujara pushed Anderson towards point and set off for a single. India skipper Virat Kohli responded to his call and came down the pitch, only to change his mind and retreat with Pujara committed to the run.
England debutant Pope kept his composure, however, the 20-year-old Surrey batsman sprinting in from point to remove the bails, rather than having a wild shy at the stumps. AFP
****
flash : India were 54 for 4 wickets in 22.4 overs with Virat Kohli being dismissed for 23 caught by Jos Buttler off the bowling of Chris Woakes with A Rahane unbeaten on 13.and D Karthik not out 4.

'Breathless Edgbaston proves Tests are still the best'
England's 1,000th Test produced a match befitting the occasion.
The home side's 31-run win over India, completed at the end of a very special hour and a half on a sunny Saturday in Birmingham, left everyone breathless.
It was so typical of Edgbaston, a ground that time and again produces these great finishes with the crowd so heavily involved.
Recently, we have seen many one-sided Tests, where one team gets on top and steamrolls to victory, with the opposition unable to mount any sort of resistance.
This first Test was not like that at all. It ebbed and flowed. Both teams were only ever a 50-run partnership or a couple of wickets away from being on top.
When England were 216-3 on the first day, then again when India were 100-5 on the second, Joe Root's men had the opportunity to nail it down.
Then, only 24 hours before the match ended, I was on the outfield with Root, Alastair Cook and James Anderson as part of the 1,000th Test celebrations. They had long faces because they thought they were going to lose.
That the game swung this way was because of individual displays, mistakes and the conditions.
Performances like Virat Kohli's batting in both innings, Sam Curran's counter-attack on the third afternoon and Ben Stokes' spell on the fourth and final morning.
Deficiencies from batsmen on both sides against the moving ball and a number of dropped catches.
A pitch that showed the folly of playing Test cricket on rolled-out concrete where batsmen pile on the runs. This match has proved that help for the bowlers makes for exciting contests.
You cannot control if a ball will swing or not, but you can offer seam movement or turn, just enough so a batsman never feels in.
Time and again we see that the most compelling Tests are the ones where bowlers are given encouragement.
There will be comparisons drawn with the Ashes Test of 2005 on this ground. It was nice to hear someone like Curran talk about how that game had an influence on him. He would have only been seven years old at the time.
Now, matches like this, finishing with Stokes being roared on by the Hollies Stand, will inspire the next generation.
In the short term, after Stokes bowled so well across the entire match, we are left to wonder how England will cope without him for the second at Lord's, which starts on Thursday.
His affray trial begins on Monday, but he allayed any worries he might be distracted with his performance this week.
Stokes is a fantastic competitor and he used this as a reminder of what a fine all-round cricketer he really is. While replacing Stokes will be a headache for Root, the England skipper can at least be pleased with his own leadership during that final session. I spoke before the series of how Root is still to stamp his authority on the captaincy, but everything went right for him on Saturday morning.
The decision to bring the leg-spin of Adil Rashid into the attack might have looked obvious from a distance, but it is different when you are the captain and you know someone like Hardik Pandya could take him to the cleaners.
Instead, Rashid did what he was supposed to do and pinned Ishant Sharma with a googly.
Root kept faith with Dawid Malan at second slip, despite the Middlesex player's drops in this match. Malan repaid him with a smart catch off Anderson.
England's tactic of starving Kohli of the strike also worked. The India skipper was denied the chance of a flying start. Root's confidence in his own captaincy should now go up a notch or two.
Speaking of Kohli, it is now his job to revive an India team that rolled over here four years ago.
Kohli played so beautifully in this match, but he told me after the game that making his first century in England was secondary to the result. India move on to Lord's, where it is likely to be dry, suiting the tourists.
You feel India have to win in London. If they find themselves 2-0 down heading to Trent Bridge, where we will probably find more traditional English conditions, it's a long way back.
As we leave Edgbaston, Kohli will be one of the memories that I take with me.
His 'mic drop' celebration, Curran's six to bring up his half-century, the tension of the wickets falling on the final morning.
Who says Tests cannot be the future of cricket When it is like what we have seen in Birmingham, it is brilliant.
When you watch, enjoy and appreciate, it is still the best version of the game.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday that the Government plans to launch a countrywide programme to provide financial assistance to women for the introduction of grassroots projects.
These projects would be implemented with the direct contribution of women and the government is presently studying the mechanism to be adopted for the implementation of this project, he said.
He added that this project is to be implemented around the country in addition to the Gamperaliya programme and the people would be kept informed about all details of the programme soon.
The Prime Minister was addressing a workshop to educate women at Temple Trees yesterday.
This year is a unique year for women as the present government succeeded in increasing the number of womens representatives in Local Government to 22 per cent from 1 per cent. The government intends to further increase it to 25 per cent, the Premier said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe added that the women have a role in the implementation of the Gamperaliya programme at grass root level.

Defeat trade union terrorism collectively: Minister Sagala
Prime Ministers Chief of Staff and Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake spoke strongly against the trade unionists whove been relentlessly engaged in strikes, stating that there should be a collective effort to defeat trade union terrorism.
He said commuters, especially students, sitting for the Advanced Level examinations, were severely inconvenienced due to the sudden strike. He added that as a government, they were duty-bound to protect the rights of all and that the government tenets of democracy and human rights should not be perceived as a weakness.
Following is the full text of the statement:
Several railway trade unions sunk to a new low last evening when they launched an unannounced strike, inconveniencing tens of thousands of passengers that use the railway service on a daily basis.
The commuters were detained against their will by trade union leaders who showed callous disregard for the interests of the public  particularly young students currently sitting for their A/L examination.
What they demonstrated yesterday was nothing but trade union terrorism, which elevates the unfair demands of a handful of trade unions above all else.
It goes without saying that we, as a country, must work together to defeat this trade union terrorism in the same way we defeated the separatist terrorism which crippled the nation for over three decades. While we have the greatest respect for trade unions and their rights, it is imperative trade unions act in a civilized manner within an ethical framework. Launching unannounced union actions at peak hours targeting hapless and vulnerable commuters returning home to their loved ones after a long day of work, is unacceptable.
Engaging in strike action must be the last resort of trade unions and not something performed at any provocation.
It is within this context that we have to understand the public outrage following the trade union action last evening. As a government, we are duty-bound to protect the rights of everyone alike both strikers and protestors. We have to make sure law and order is maintained and commuters return home to their families safely. It is with this in mind that we acted to diffuse the tense situation that developed in the Colombo Fort area.
Our government is responsible and respects the worker for fighting for his demands, but our commitment to the tenets of democracy and human rights should not be perceived as weakness. We will take every possible action to defeat this ugly trade union terrorism. For this we request the support of the public  we must work to defeat these unruly elements who have no qualms about holding the entire country to ransom.

## Title: The Disability question
## Supertitle:

## Date: Saturday, August 11, 2018 - 01:00
The Disability question
Disability is no longer an uncompromising term. Thanks to the intervention of numerous government as well as non-governmental organisations, the physical fragility has earned an official status. Sri Lanka entered a new plane of human rights by formulating a national policy on disability in 2003. Over a decade has lapsed, though not much to the satisfaction of the disability movement.
Practical issues emerge when policies translate into action. The theoretical knowledge imprinted in the policy statements do not pass down to the grassroots officials. A disabled person living in a remote hamlet off Anuradhapura cannot receive his/her entitled monthly allowance from the Grama Niladhari without much hassle. The disabled persons are led to the conviction that they are given some favouration. The local competent authorities, on the other hand, complain of lack of funds when questioned about the rights that the disabled persons are entitled to, are something the officials are not aware of.
When the two television journalists reached the northern and eastern hemisphere of this country, they had a specific goal. Their programme, telecasted over a Tamil channel, is dedicated to disabled persons who overcame the challenges of life. But they had a challenge.
Physical infirmity
The current phenomenon compels a disabled persons family to capitalize on the physical infirmity. The arrival of a media personnel from the capital means some opportunity available for seizure. The families have enough ammunition to feed the media and receive sympathy in return. Disability comes first. Then poverty. That naturally leads to a third element, illiteracy. These three elements are the pillars of a crumbling order.
We are not an intermediary between the government and the recipients, the producer of the channel who needs to remain unidentified, says. The television programme producer has a sole aim: expose the disabled persons who have overcome the obstacles in life and thus inspire the fellow disabled persons.
Although a national policy on disability is in force in Sri Lanka at the request of the Disability Movement, the attitude towards the physical fragility is yet to change. The people with disabilities are yet to be an integral part of inclusion in society. A girl with no limbs flourished in making handiwork using her mouth. But that generates sympathy more than inspiration. And the disability is mostly accredited to a karmic force and the cluster is considered de facto apartheid.
They generate ample amount of compassion. But what they actually need is a market to suit their skills. They need aid. But the inflow of aid to Sri Lanka from foreign donors through the mediation of non-governmental organisation is also facing challenge. Sri Lanka formed a national policy on disability in 2003. With more than a decade lapsed, the country is yet to enter a sophisticated disability-friendly platform. The local organisations related to disability movement have been depending on the foreign donors which in turn converts to self-income generation projects such as horticulture and handwork.
But that should not be the destination. The disabled persons of the rural areas shall go further beyond mere projects of minor scale. The foreign donors are now sending smoke signals to the local NGOs: the funds should be allocated more sophisticated projects. Fair by the donors, the funds cannot be allocated to a stagnating industry. Most NGOs operating in Sri Lanka face a problem what most others are unaware of. Their funding is now becoming low. The funding evolved over the years only to prove that Sri Lanka has already become a country without a proper strategic plan. The donors request the NGOs to solve the countrys concerns at any cost.
The Sign Language, for instance, has been made official. The persons with hearing disabilities can now be witness to the news and current affairs, as national news is available in sign language. Yet its expansionism remains a puzzle. This was strongly felt during the election eve when the people with hearing disabilities did not have access to the would-be legislators opinions and statements. It finally affects their franchise right as well.
Although gone unnoticed most of the time, the people with hearing impairments are the largest group that faces most obstacles in dealing with the daily situations. The dearth of sign language teachers has led to this unwelcome shortage of sign language users on electronic media. This unfortunate phenomenon has taken a toll on the practical perspective of the inclusive education.
Disability is largely a misunderstood concept. A wheelchair, for instance, cannot be designed in the same way. The wheelchair should be brought out with the recipients requirement in mind.
The disability comes equipped with another unavoidable element: stigma. A lot of families come to grips with this phenomenon. When a disabled child is born, the husband and his family tends to pass it as a blame on the mother. The birth of the disabled child is considered as the fault of the mother.
Although the governments budget has given green light to the funding for the disabled, how it breaks down has practical issues. The disability money allocated to a Pradeshiya Sabha at times remain unused as the officials have no proper awareness of the disability-related policy. The Rs. 3,000 allowance issued per mensem to the disabled community is mostly noted as a favour instead of a right. The situation changes slowly but not steady enough.
Lesser social recognition
When the common citizens are privy to their entitlements over favouration, it makes a huge affect though at the cost of government officers at the provincial level. As more and more of the citizenry becomes aware of their rights, it enhances the workload of the pradeshiya sabhas.
When you have a disabled child, chances are more that you hardly have a life. The carers of certain childs homes hardly apply for leave. But then the challenge of the disabled allowance is the equal distribution. A person with the spinal injury may not be entitled to the sum of Rs 3,000 because that disability is not visible.
In the workshops, it has been observed that the provincial journalists are more concerned about the disabled community than the city journalists. The city journalists have more national issues to cover, whereas most disabled people belong to rural communities where the provincial journalists roam. The city journalists are mostly highly educated whereas the provincial journalists are from lesser posh backgrounds and lesser social recognition.

Dissolve PCs into District Councils: State Minister
State Minister of Foreign Affairs Vasantha Senanayake, has written to the President, Prime Minister and Parliament, suggesting that provincial councils be replaced in favour of more regional District Councils.
At a press briefing held at the Ministry of State Affairs on Friday, State Minister Senanayake said that his proposal seeks to address the shortfalls of the provincial council as it exists today and the injustices the provincial council system causes. He cited the unfair weight given to larger districts within the scope of Provincial Councils.
In his letter, Senanayake mentioned the political disparity between his home district of Polonnaruwa as compared to Anuradhapura, as well as the Northern district of Wanni, compared to the Jaffna District. The Minister said that under the Provincial Council system, Polonnaruwa and the Wanni are disadvantaged both politically and economically.
He further writes, I have realized thus that our rural communities do not really benefit from devolution, for the Provincial Council system as we have it privileges the larger towns and urban populations. Meanwhile, the politicians involved see themselves as national politicians one level down and perform accordingly, instead of concentrating on local needs.\
I think it is time we discuss that Provincial Councils are not serving the use that we originally intended that we serve, said Senanayake at the press briefing. So why are we spending the taxpayers money funding a Provincial Council that is useless The Minister pointed to the fact that the Tamil National Alliance was willing to postpone Provincial Council elections almost indefinitely, though they were the group championing the Provincial Council system in the first place.

Englands Stokes admits to memory blackout on night of street brawl
BRISTOL Friday: England cricketer Ben Stokes told a court on Friday he was absolutely not an angry man who lost all control in a street brawl and admitted his faltering recollection of events was due to a significant memory blackout.
International star Stokes and Ryan Ali, both 27, are being tried for affray over a brawl that erupted in Bristol, southwest England, in the early hours of September 25 last year.
The cricketer faced cross-examination from the prosecutor Nicholas Corsellis on the fifth day of the trial at Bristol Crown Court.
Stokes said he intervened because Ali and his friend Ryan Hale had directed alleged homophobic abuse at gay men William O'Connor and Kai Barry as they walked away from Mbargo nightclub.
He could not recall what was said, but I am very clear that the words that were used were homophobic, he told the court. Corsellis asked Stokes if he had a significant memory blackout from the night in question.
The sportsman replied: You could say that, yes.Stokes and other England cricketers, including Alex Hales, went out celebrating beating the West Indies in a match in Bristol on September 24.
Stokes said he would have had a bottle of beer after the match, two or three pints at the hotel, five or six vodka and lemonades and then potentially had some Jaegerbombs in Mbargo. AFP

He was addressing a meeting at the Peoples Bank Kegalle branch to introduce Enterprise Sri lanka development loan scheme.
Minister Hashim said Rs. 200 million was allocated to each electorate for the Gamperaliya rural development project introduced by the government, recently.
According to a survey conducted by the Central Bank last year, it was revealed that over 25 percent of the unemployed youths are willing to start self-employment projects if they are supported by loans. These youths are not demanding for government jobs and the government has now come to their rescue, he said.
Under the Gamperaliya project, all state banks will have a special counter to assist borrowers seeking soft loans to start self-employment projects, the minister said.
If one individual with potential succeeds in his/her venture, 10 members of the family will stand to gain.
Therefore, prospective entrepreneurs should be assisted.
The officer at the Gamperaliya Bank counter, therefore, has an important role when assisting those who seek loans, the minister said.
He added that small and medium-scale enterprises which employ over 45 percent of employees in the country contribute 52 percent to the GDP.Kegalle Regional Secretary Shyamalee Piyatissa, Mawanella Local Council Chairman Anura Chandana, former PC Member Upul Shyamal Bandara, UC Member Ishara Harischandra, Kegalle Peoples Bank Provincial Manager Gamini Karunaratna, businessmen and others attended.

Ex-Tour de France winner Ullrich held over escort assault
Frankfurt am Main, Friday: Former Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich was arrested Friday for allegedly assaulting a prostitute in Frankfurt, police said, just a week after the German national was briefly detained in Spain.
He is in police custody, a German police spokesman told AFP, adding that the 44-year-old was under the influence of alcohol and drugs.
Ullrich had allegedly called on the services of a prostitute at the five-star Villa Kennedy Hotel in Frankfurt, Bild daily reported.
But he then got into a quarrel with the escort lady and physically attacked and injured her, police said.
Ullrich allegedly had so tightly choked her that her vision went black, said prosecutor Nadja Niesen, adding that an investigation is continuing on possible grievous bodily harm.
The accused cannot yet be heard.
He is still under the influence of significant levels of alcohol and drugs, she added.
Ullrichs latest woes came a week after he was detained for 24 hours in Spain for allegedly forcing his way into the home of his neighbour, German actor Til Schweiger, and threatening him.
Following the scandal in Spain, Ullrich said early this week he would go into rehab and seek help for his drink and drug addiction.
I have a good feeling in my gut, I feel well. This will be my new start, Ullrich told Bild.
But he had only arrived back in Germany on Thursday evening to start his therapy before getting caught up in the latest drama, Bild reported.
- From cycling to drink-driving -
The former cyclists dramatic fall from grace came two decades after he became the only German to have won the Tour de France, in 1997.
Born in the former communist East Germany, Ullrichs triumph, which came after reunification, turned him into a national hero.
He later also won Olympic gold in Sydney in 2000, but failed to replicate his victory at the gruelling French race, finishing for several years behind US cyclist Lance Armstrong.
Like Armstrong, who was subsequently stripped of all his seven Tour de France wins over doping, Ullrich was embroiled in allegations that he used performance boosting substances.
The German was excluded from the 2006 Tour de France over his links to the Operation Puerto scandal that centred on disgraced doctor Eufemiano Fuentes, who gave performance-enhancing blood transfusions to top cyclists.
After retiring from cycling in 2007, Ullrich finally came clean in 2013 about his doping past.
Since then, he has been caught up in drinking problems.
In 2014, he injured two people in a car crash in Switzerland, and was charged with drink driving.
He was convicted three years later over the case by a Swiss court for drink driving. Sentenced to 21 months in prison, Ullrich was however able to convert that into a suspended sentence of four years plus a fine of 10,000 euros.
Amid his latest woes, his former rival turned friend Armstrong offered his support, according to Bild.
Ullrichs lawyer Wolfgang Hoppe told the newspaper that Armstrong said he was ready to immediately get into a plane with his doctor and come to Europe to help the German.
Armstrong said that the cycling community must hold together.
But that the most important is that Jan first allows himself to be helped, said Hoppe, recounting a telephone conversation with the disgraced US cyclist.

Flashback: When an England cricketer won a bet by scoring a fifty in a Test match
England cricket didnt resume on a great note after the World War I as they went down 0-5 in the 1920/21 Ashes in Australia and a 10-wicket defeat in the first home Test in Nottingham forced a bulk of changes in the team. The selection panel looked towards Lionel Hallam Tennyson, former International and Hampshire batsman who was nowhere in the reckoning. Lord Tennyson, who was well known for his gambling skills, had scored a couple of hundreds while leading his team in the County Championship.
The Hampshire skipper scored an unbeaten 131 against Lancashire ahead of the Oval Test but couldnt save his team from a defeat. The 131-run knock was a follow-up to his 101 against Yorkshire which also was on a losing cause. After the completion of the game against Lancashire, Tennyson went to a club on Old Bond Street in London, well past midnight, when he received the news of his call-up for the Lords Test match starting the following morning.
LOST THE MATCH WON THE BET
Tennyson walked out to bat at No.7 on the first day after his team won the toss. His comeback innings was cut short to five runs as he was stumped off Arthur Mailey. England were bowled for only 187 and the visitors replied by posting 342 runs. Tennyson came out to bat once again at No.7 when England were 165/5 and levelled Australias first-innings lead. The 31-year-old ensured he didnt waste his second chance by scoring an unbeaten fifty.
He scored an unbeaten 74 in 102 minutes with nine fours batting out with the tail to help his team make 283 in the 2nd innings. The Australians chased down the target of 129 for the loss of two wickets to take a 2-0 lead in the 5-match Test series. Tennysons fifty not only helped him feature in the remainder of the series but also won him a bet of 50. Ahead of the match, the England batsman struck a 50 wager that he would score a fifty in the Test.
CAPTAINCY
Jack Hobbs recovered from his leg injury but suffered appendicitis on the first day morning in the next match at the Leeds. He didnt take the field in the remainder of the match and the captaincy responsibilities were handed over to Lord Tennyson. The new England skipper also split his hand but was gritty enough to score 63 and 36 respectively batting with one hand.
However, the Australians clinched the series with a 219-run win and took a 3-0 lead. Tennyson remained as the England captain in the final two Test matches and England put up a strong fight. However, Australia managed to draw both the Tests and kept their lead intact until the end of the series. Tennyson scored 51 in the only innings he batted across the last two Tests but never appeared in a Test for England.

Harsha, Buddhika flare up over corporal punishment on children
A heated exchange of words ensued between National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva and Industry and Commerce Deputy Minister Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament yesterday, over corporal punishment on children.
Deputy Minister Pathirana argued in favour of corporal punishment on children to maintain discipline in schools while State Minister de Silva firmly spoke against it.
The two members were speaking on a Private Members Motion by UNP MP Rohini Kumari Wijeratne which proposed to implement a programme to properly carry out disciplinary inquiries by Student Discipline Committees of schools.
Dr.de Silva pointed out that caning or meting out giving physical punishment to children for minor offenses badly affects their mentality and they tend to become violent when they become youths.
These physical punishments leave bad memories on children and affect their personality. Such children may become violent or repeat such acts to their children, he said.
Deputy Minister Pathirana countering de Silva said that minor corporal punishments are needed to maintain discipline in schools. Today the discipline is seriously eroding in schools. Students are assaulting teachers and principals. Our society is very regressive and child protection laws are being misused. We need to revise those laws, he commented.
Dr de Silva objecting to the Deputy Minister pointed out Sri Lanka Parliament has passed Corporal Punishment (Repeal) Act in 2005 and according to it giving corporal punishment is against the countrys laws. You are an MP and you cannot speak in the House in favour of breaking the countrys laws.
I too am a father of two children and I have never given physical punishment to them. It must be firmly stated here that the teachers cannot give corporal punishment, said de Silva.

Help this 'lovely' couple
The Daily News met present-time Shahjahan and Mumtaz Mahal at Yatigalpoththa, Galewela recently.
The similarity between the Shahjahan couple and Priyantha and Niroshani couple is that the latter couple are living with great attachment to each other. They have nine children.
Unfortunately Priyantha and Niroshani are not as rich as Shahjahan and still dreaming of completing their Taj Mahal for their loving children.
Priyantha Weerakkody (37) is plucking coconuts for a living, while his wife Gayani Niroshani Dissanayake is looking after the children.
"My eldest is 13-year-old. The youngest is 4 years old. One of our children left us forever," Weerakkody said.
"I am plucking coconuts in the morning and come home to spend the rest of the time with my family. That is the brightest part of my life. I never hope of building houses or to buy lands but to bring up my children. My wife readily agreed and we did it. The sad part is that she became a little bit weak."
Weerakkody is from Kandy and Niroshani is from Kadawatha. They had brought a small land at Galewela with the money Niroshani had saved and built a house there but they were unable to complete it.Now they live in their half-built house.
"Our marriage is a result of a love affair," Niroshani said. "He had not changed his love and does all the household chores in the evening as I am weak. One daughter is not with us. She was sent to another place as there is a belief that it is unlucky to have nine children together," she said.
Remaining eight children are schooling. They said they find it difficult to afford uniforms and meal. The most difficult part is to afford private tuition today since the education has become more competitive than those days. Priyantha and Niroshani said that they will bring up their children well and make them serve the nation. Their contact number is 0764020275.

Hidden political hand behind sudden strikes
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera struck a defiant tone yesterday saying that there was a political hand in the sudden strike by railway workers adding that this government would not be bullied into adhoc salary revisions.
Next Tuesday, Cabinet is to approve a proposal for the setting up of a commission which would look into the salary anomalies of the state sector while their report will be the basis upon which any revisions would be made, he said. We cannot increase the salaries of only railway engine drivers as it would cause a huge anomaly within the other sectors of the government service.
The Minister refused to hold talks with the strikers until they gave up the protest adding that the sudden strike was uncalled for and unfair. He alleged that there was a hidden political hand at work and that the government would do everything at its disposal to alleviate the difficulties faced by commuters and students sitting for their Advanced Level examinations. During the last few days alone, we have had the unstinted support of the Army who ran additional buses, police and bus operators who offered their services at no cost, he said.
We have allowed bus operators without permits to operate and invite them to register with the National Transport Commission for a special service until the situation returns to normalcy, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister added that once bus operators (even those without permits) have registered with the NTC, they would be given the opportunity to operate in the mornings and evenings and would be compensated for by the Treasury. Commuters are permitted to use their season tickets when travelling on SLTB buses. I urge the strikes to stop their protest and come for a discussion with the authorities. Their issues can only be resolved through discussions and we are prepared to talk if they are willing to stop their strike. he said.
The Minister elaborating further added that the existing basic salary of an engine driver was Rs.44,600. However, their take home salary inclusive of allowances amount to nearly Rs.200 000.
However, they have been agitating for an increase in their basic salary up to Rs.56,205.
Minister Samarweera added that an increase of the basic salary scale would cause a huge anomaly in the salaries of other state sector employees across the board. He assured that the issue would be sorted within the next two to three months.

Hockey star Junaid M Ayub did St. Sylvesters proud
Junaid M. Ayub having played Hockey, Football and Cricket was one of the top All Rounders produced by St. Sylvesters College, Kandy.
Having represented his Alma Mater in Hockey, Football and Cricket he has achieved milestones in his sporting journey which are yet to be surpassed.
He was the only Sri Lankan, to play for the Western and Southern Command of the Indian Navy, in 1971 and 1972.
According to hockey analysts at that time, Ayub was the most scientific centre half and was an automatic choice for the then National team. However he could not continue his hockey carrier as he had to concentrate on his work as third officer at Ceylon shipping Corporation and second and Chief Officer at Saudi  Europe Lines.
Ayub started his sporting career by first playing for college U 17 team and went on to play for All Island nationals as well. His skills earned him the captaincy of the under 20 team in 1968.
He also captained the Under 20, Combined Kandy Schools team and was instrumental in scoring the winning goal during the last 7 minutes, to win the Championships in the All Island Nationals, held at Matale in 1968.
It was a very, very tough to win a hockey championship at Matale at that time, he recalled.
Commander of the Sri Lanka Navy, Rear Admiral Rajan Kadirgamar who was the Chief Guest and this tournament saw his talent and assisted Ayub to join the Sri Lanka Navy as an Officer Cadet.
When in College, Ayub was the only Sylvestrian in the Senior National hockey pool and also toured India with the Colombo hockey team, to India in 1968.
He also represented Sri Lanka National schools team (only Sylvestrian) and toured India, for the Indo Sri Lanka Dual Sports contest.
While in Scholl he also played for Kandy Whites hockey team and for BRC, which at that time, was a sheer honor to secure a place.
After joining Navy he went on to captained their hockey team in 1974 and guided to be a major force to be reckoned with.
He also played for Defense Services hockey team as a Centre half and was instrumental to win the All island National hockey championships, at Badulla in 1973.
He also played for Colombo HA in the All Island hockey Nationals and scored the only goal during the last 5 minutes against the National hockey team goal keeper, late Johnny Martin of Mercantile HA. Colombo HA had only 3 National players, where Mercantile had 8 National players.

How cricketers use sledging for their tactical advantage
Sledging is a term used in cricket where one or more player of a team picks up a verbal fight or intimidates player(s) of a rival team, to de-motivate or make them lose their focus. This has been in practice since long but has gained a lot of traction of late. Various cricket bodies like ICC and stalwarts of the game like Sunil Gavaskar, and Rahul Dravid etc. have raised their voices against this malpractice.
Sledging started when W.G. Grace played in the late 1880s. They made noises to tease opponents. Australians started this practice in the 1960s on a big scale where the players cursed in front of women during the Sheffield Shield competition. This boosted their ego and became a wooing tactic. Ian Chappell and Rod Marsh used profanity so that they broke batsman's concentration. Australian bowler Merv Hughes admitted that he took 25 % of the wickets just because of sledging. Ricky Ponting supported this practice by saying that sledging helps get players 'out of control' and 'out of their comfort zone'.
India also started sledging with Sourav Ganguly at her helm in the early 2000s. Virender Sehwag has said, "If there's no sledging, there would not be any enjoyment left in the game." MS Dhoni treats sledging as an 'art' and has said it is fair as long as a 'line' isn't crossed. Current Captain Virat Kohli is on another level of aggression and sledging. He once said, "We take it very well and we give it back even better."
Sledging has a number of goals for each player and they use it tactically to gain competitive advantage; specifically, to break concentration and induce anxiety through oral or facial intimidation. Some batsmen enjoy being sledged and they use it to heighten their performance. Vivian Richards, Virat Kohli and Sachin Tendulkar etc. relished being talked to and they gave it back in style.
FEW INSTANCES OF SLEDGING
South African pacer Kagiso Rabada was sledging Kohli after the on-field umpire adjudged Kohli LBW. Kohli gave Rabada a death stare and called for a review. The third umpire overturned his decision. Kohli went on to score 160*.
Vivian Richards was playing a county match. The night before the match, he had a lot of drinks and was feeling hung over. The opening pair got out early so he had to walk in. Due to the hangover, he was unable to concentrate and got beaten by the bowler Greg Thomas, four times in a row. Greg said, Its red, it's about five and a half ounces and you are supposed to hit it. The next ball was hit so powerfully by Richards that it went in the stands.
Viv gave him a look and said, Since you know the shape, size, and color  now go find it. During a test match between Pakistan and Australia in 1991, Miandad sledged Merv Hughes: "Merv you are a big, fat bus conductor".
Merv was furious and within a few balls, he dismissed Miandad. He quickly ran past Miandad and shouted: "Tickets please!". - sk

How the Premier Leagues top six stand after transfer window
LONDON, Thursday - With the Premier Leagues transfer window closing on Thursday, the top title contenders have completed their squad building until January.
Here AFP Sport looks at how the divisions elite teams fared in the transfer market and what their prospects are for the coming season:
MANCHESTER CITY
After sweeping to the title with a record 100 points and more wins and goals than any previous team in the Premier League era, it was tough for Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola to improve his stylish side. Guardiola opted for only one significant new recruit, landing Algeria winger Riyad Mahrez from Leicester in a 60 million swoop. Mahrez bolsters Citys already impressive array of attacking talent and, while Guardiola missed out on Italy midfielder Jorginho, who instead joined Chelsea, the champions combination of youthful swagger and world-class talent still makes them favourites to reign supreme again at the end of the season.
MANCHESTER UNITED
Jose Mourinho made an early splash as he spent 52 million on Shakhtar Donetsks Brazil midfielder Fred and a further 19 million on Porto defender Diogo Dalot, but the Manchester United manager was still underwhelmed by his clubs business. Mourinho spent much of Uniteds pre-season tour of the United States grumbling about the lack of depth in his squad and reportedly feuding with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward over failed approaches for defenders Harry Maguire, Yerry Mina and Toby Alderweireld. After finishing second last season -- 19 points behind City -- United look no closer to bridging the gap to their hated rivals.
TOTTENHAM
Mauricio Pochettino had challenged his club to be brave and take risks when asked what Tottenham needed to do to improve their squad following their third-place finish last season. Fast forward three months and the north Londoners are under-fire from their fans after failing to make a single signing. Pochettino is adamant Tottenhams lack of transfer activity isnt a problem because it was just as important to hold onto the clubs key players.
Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Son Heung-min and Kieran Trippier have all signed new contracts since May. I am not worried, I am not sad, I am so happy. To keep our best players was our objective and we have achieved that, Pochettino said.
LIVERPOOL
Determined to build on a fine season that saw his team finish as Champions League runners-up and take fourth place in the Premier League, Reds boss Jurgen Klopp embarked on a 160-million spending spree. Klopp landed Roma goalkeeper Alisson Becker for 66 million and paid 52 million for RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita. Not content with those eye-catching deals, Klopp added midfielder Fabinho from Monaco for 39 million and landed Stoke playmaker Xherdan Shaqiri in an 18-million move. Having knocked City out of the Champions League last season, while also beating them in domestic action, Liverpool are expected to mount a strong challenge for the title as they look to end their 29-year wait to be crowned kings of English football.
CHELSEA
Hired to replace the sacked Antonio Conte, Blues manager Maurizio Sarri insists he is happy to leave the wheeling and dealing to Chelseas hierarchy -- a stark contrast to his predecessors constant complaints about transfers. Jorginho was Chelseas first close-season signing as the Italy midfielder followed Sarri from Napoli in a 57-million deal. Belgian goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois was allowed to join Real Madrid to be closer to his children, with Croatia midfielder Mateo Kovacic moving to Chelsea on a season-long loan as part of the deal. The 31-million fee for Courtois was immediately reinvested in Spain international Kepa Arrizabalaga, who arrived from Athletic Bilbao for 72.1 million -- a world record for a keeper. Crucially, Chelsea have so far staved off interest from Real and Barcelona in Eden Hazard and Willian.
ARSENAL
Heralding the start of a new era at Arsenal following Arsene Wengers departure last season, Gunners manager Unai Emery has been given a host of new faces in a bid to end his clubs decline.
Wengers 22-year reign ended with a wretched sixth-place finish and a second successive season without Champions League action has had a profound effect on Arsenals recruitment, with star names now hard to come by. Former Paris Saint-Germain boss Emery appears willing to let chief scout Sven Mislintat, director of football Raul Sanllehi and chief executive Ivan Gazidis call the transfer shots and that trio have made a series of cut-price deals for Matteo Guendouzi, Bernd Leno, Lucas Torreira, Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Stephan Lichtsteiner.

Sri Lanka was on course for a big total when Nishan Madushka and Nuwanidu Fernando put together a third wicket stand of 101 and the score at one time read 171-3, but a lower order collapse saw them struggle to 212-9 having lost six wickets for 41 runs.
Madushka missed out on a hundred by five runs when he was dismissed for 95 scored off 136 balls (7 fours) and Fernando contributed 56 off 68 balls (5 fours, 1 six).
Madushka was named Player of the Series and Sashika Dulshan took the Best Bowlers award. Pawan Shah of India was named the Best Batsman.

Judiciary moves strong against Contempt of Court
The public interest moved to the Judiciary this week, following the Court of Appeal decision to sentence the General Secretary of the Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera to six years of rigorous imprisonment, over his contemptuous behaviour in the Homagama Magistrates Court in January 2016.
Gnanasara Thera was found guilty of all four charges of contemptuous behaviour framed against him, proved beyond reasonable doubt, in an important expression of the Independence of the Judiciary in recent years. The sentence was 19 years of rigorous imprisonment, served concurrently within six years. The Court of Appeal held there was overwhelming evidence, proving beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the accused Thera before the Magistrate had been with deliberate intention. It was to intimidate the Magistrate, to obtain an order the Thera had desired, mainly bail for the suspects in the case before the Homagama Magistrates Court, relating to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Eknaligoda.
Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to six months in prison earlier this year, for threatening Sandya Eknaligoda, wife of the missing cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda in the same Magistrates Court.
There was opposition from Buddhist activists to the Thera having to wear the jumper  the uniform of all prisoners, although there are other Buddhist monks wearing this uniform in prison. He was released from prison following his appeal to this six-month sentence. Lawyers for Gnanasara Thera informed the Court of Appeal they would file an appeal against the latest sentence of six years imprisonment. The Thera was not in court when the sentence was passed, as he was undergoing treatment at the Sri Jayewardenepura Hospital.
Interest in the Judiciary - and Contempt of Court, increased with two other cases. The Court of Appeal issued summons on the Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran and three others, to appear in Court. It is on a complaint they had acted in contempt of an Interim Order of the Court, preventing the Chief Minister from removing the petitioner B. Denishwaram from functioning as the Minister of Fisheries and Transport in the Northern Provincial Council.
Interestingly, Chief Minister Vigneswaran was a former Justice of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka.
There is more interest in the Judiciary with Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake pleading not guilty to a charge sheet filed against him over allegations of Contempt of Court. This refers to statements made earlier by Mr. Ramanayake about members of the legal profession and those in the judiciary. All judges of the Supreme Court had determined to proceed with Contempt of Court charges against the Deputy Minister having perused the transcripts and video footage related to his alleged statements.
Opposition Leader chase
There is diversion in the politics of the Joint Opposition, moving away from the defeat of the Yahapalana coalition and plans for the coming presidential and general elections, to the demand for the office of Leader of the Opposition.
The big debate in parliament this week was over declaring the JOs leading member in parliamentary business, Dinesh Gunawardena, as Leader of the Opposition. The JO is not a registered party in parliament, though a group with at least 70, in a house of 225 members. Dinesh Gunawardena could certainly be a good Leader of the Opposition, with his experience in parliament as an MP and Minister, and his personal and political background. His personal suitability apart, there is the political reality of the JO. The leader of the JO is none other than Mahinda Rajapaksa, functional leader of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), former Prime Minister and Executive President, and the mover and shaker of the JO today. Is it not strange the JO does not call for Mahinda Rajapaksa as Leader the Opposition (L/O), but keep pushing for Dinesh G
The Office of L/O is a political twist from the time of the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa from the office of President in January 2015. After that change in government, with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the MPs of the MR government, were an opposition with a parliamentary majority, but unable to assert any political strength. Strangely, Nimal Siripala de Silva was then the L/O with many more MPs behind him than the new Prime Minister had. The adoption of the 19th Amendment, which defined the political party structure, and the results of the General Election in August 2015, changed the whole picture.
The reality today is that all members of the parliamentary group known as the JO contested the election as candidates of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, a political alliance founded by former Sri Lankan president Chandrika Kumaratunga in 2004, which continued under MR leadership. It brought together the SLFP, MEP, and other political parties that accepted MRs leadership. However, the harsh reality is that the leader of both the SLFP and the UPFA today is President Maithripala Sirisena. The UPFA Secretary at the time of the general election was from the SLFP. Mahinda Rajapaksa too was an SLFP/UPFA candidate, returned from Kurunegala District. By the time of that general election, MR had given up his leadership of the SLFP and consequently of the UPFA. All those who are now in the JO, (other than Wimal Weerawansas NFF) are members of the UPFA, whether members of the SLFP, MEP or any other associated party. At least 20 elected and appointed MPs after that poll remain in government, under the leadership of President Sirisena.
What the JO is calling for is a political convolution, to escape their own twist in parliamentary politics. As members of the UPFA or SLFP, they cannot be in both the Government and the Opposition. To be a party of the Opposition they must resign from the UPFA/SLFP and face the possible consequences, which could be the loss of parliamentary seats. They must not forget that MR remains an advisor to the SLFP, as a former party leader. They are in a political trap of ones own making, of being in both government and opposition, without the courage to move out of the party and the alliance that gave their seats in parliament. The spin continues with several members of the JO showing allegiance to President Sirisena as the SLFP leader, with the suspicions they have of the SLPP and the Pohottuwa.
This diversion of the politics of the JO seems more a desire to escape from the emerging conflicts of the Rajapaksa family on the next candidate for the presidency, and a possible diversion from coming court cases on fraud and corruption by the Rajapaksa Regime.
The loss of Anna in Tamil Nadu
The passing away of Tamil Nadu political leader Muthuvel Karunanidhi marks the end of one of Indias prolific political leaders, who had a major impact on Sri Lanka, too.
Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu five times between 1969 and 2011, who rose from poor working class parents to join the former Justice Party as a student, saw him rise to a decisive figure in both Tamil Nadu and Union politics, and a key mover in bolstering Tamil identity in Indias federal structure.
One with radical views, oratorical skills, and a strong respecter of the Self-Respect Movement, which envisioned a society where backward castes would have equal rights. He campaigned against the caste supremacy of Brahmins and opposed a move by the federal government to impose Hindi as an official language of communication in South India.
Karunanadhi helped found the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party in 1949, which would go on to be one of the most influential political entities in India.
He will be remembered in Sri Lankan politics for the sympathies he had for the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He was supportive of the separatist politics of the Tamils and especially the LTTE, and provided the LTTE a good base for training and activity in Tamil Nadu. However, the LTTEs assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did cost him much in Tamil Nadu politics. He remained a strong voice for the LTTE until the final days of the war in Sri Lanka, but could not make the Indian Government support the final push to defeat the LTTE here.
A true pioneer of political theatre in Tamil Nadu, he staged and acted in plays that doubled as vehicles for his political goals. He had similar success in cinema, known as Kalainagar or the artist. Sri Lankan lovers of the old Tamil cinema will remember the film Parasakthi in 1952, with screenplay and dialogues by him, a movie that was a hit for many months. He was known for religious musicals, mythological films and family dramas.
His main political rivals were the matinee idol M. G. Ramachandran, born in Ceylon, and later Jayalalitha, who saw him for more than a decade in the opposition. Karunanidhi leaves behind the legacy of a political leader who brought together the artist, writer, activist and one of the longest players in Indian politics.

## Title: Karunanidhi, The colossus of Dravidian politics
## Supertitle:

Karunanidhi, The colossus of Dravidian politics
INDIA: Muthuvel Karunanidhi was the last of Tamil Nadu's politicians with a colossal mass following, like MG Ramachandran and Jayaram Jayalalithaa.
For decades, the state's politics was dominated by the rivalry between its two towering figures - Jayalalithaa and Karunanidhi.
Jayalalithaa died at 68 in 2016. 90-plus Karunanidhi, a five-time chief minister, had a health scare at the time but was discharged from hospital.
They both had in common great charisma, oratorical skills, and a history in films.
"Kalaignar" (artiste) was famous for his script-writing. The skill greatly helped him in his six-decade-long political career.
Born in Thirukkuvalai on June 3, 1924, a small village in Thanjavur District (now Nagapattinam), he was drawn to the Dravidian movement led by reformist leader Periyar EVR as a teen. He had faced the hardships imposed on him by poverty and his humble caste and Periyar's self-respect movement held untold promise.
A young Karunanidhi was noticed for first time when he led the famous "Kallakudi agitation" in 1953, lying over railway tracks.
He became an ardent follower of Dravidian ideologue CN Annadurai. When Annadurai founded the DMK in 1949, Karunanidhi joined the party that was born out of the Dravidian movement - a social churn that saw the consolidation of lower castes.
"Kalaignar's" RISE
"Kalaignar" rose as a star in both films and politics. He moved to Coimbatore to try his luck at scriptwriting after failing his Class 10 exam.
His screenplay in the 1952 film "Parasakthi," a hit Tamil movie was an example of how the DMK used the silver screen to reach out to the masses.
The DMK wrested power from the Congress in 1967 and never looked back.
When Annadurai died of cancer in 1969, Mr Karunanidhi became chief minister.
In the last few decades, Karunanidhi's political maneuvers ensured that Tamil Nadu was always relevant in national politics. In 1999, the DMK backed the BJP-led government in a no-confidence motion. Later, the two parties contest the national election and the DMK bagged key ministries. But in the next election, the DMK was with the Congress and stayed with the party in 2009. In 2013, Karunanidhi finally withdrew support from the Congress.
On Karunanidhi's watch, the DMK became the family-run party that it is today. The ambitions of an extended family led to political power struggles like between his two sons MK Stalin and MK Azhagiri. The appointment of Stalin, his younger son, as his heir, pushed Azhagiri into a revolt.
Azhargiri was expelled in 2014 after he spoke out too many times against his father and brother.
The DMK patriarch's second undoing was a massive telecom corruption scandal engulfing party leaders like A Raja, his own daughter Kanimozhi and grand-nephews Dayanidhi Maran and Kalanithi Maran.
The party found it hard to live down the 2G spectrum case, widely believed to be one of the biggest scandals in the country, a blow from which the Congress-led UPA never really recovered.
Karunanidhi was chief minister of Tamil Nadu when the scandal broke and at first, denied any public backlash against his party. The DMK was decimated in the next state election in 2011. "The people of Tamil Nadu have given me rest," he said.
But Karunanidhi, a 13-time lawmaker, never lost an election personally since 1957.
In 1974, his efforts led to Chief Ministers winning the right to fly the national flag on Independence Day. Karunanidhi had complained to then prime minister Indira Gandhi that everyone but the chief minister ever got the chance to unfurl the national flag. The centre agreed and on August 15 that year, Mr Karunanidhi flew the flag for the first time.
Karunanidhi was 48 when he first became chief minister. Around that time, he fell out with MG Ramachandran or MGR, a popular actor who had helped propel him to the state's top job after the death of Annadurai. In 1972, he expelled MGR, a mistake that would haunt him for many years.
MGR would go on to form the AIADMK, the DMK's lifelong rival in Tamil Nadu politics.
The AIADMK or All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam came to power in 1977 and MGR made sure the DMK didn't take power while he was alive.
Karunanidhi returned to power in 1989 after MGR's death. When the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991, Karunanidhi - seen as close to the Lankan outfit - was again defeated in the 1991 state elections. Actor politician J Jayalalithaa, a protege of MGR, came to power.
In 1996, it was Jayalalithaa facing corruption charges and the DMK returned to power. Since then, the two parties have ruled every alternate term. Except in 2016, when Jayalalithaa was elected for a historic second straight term.
Over the past few years, the DMK chief was seen to have retreated more and more from public life. He was largely seen in a wheelchair if at all, barely speaking.
GREAT SURVIVOR
The great survivor of Tamil Nadu politics, Karunanidhi was an eloquent orator, a Tamil writer of repute, indomitable publisher and all-weather political strategist. He was an unassuming party campaigner and dedicated communicator who wrote everyday messages to the cadre, penned articles for Murasoli (sound of drums), the DMKs official newspaper, proofread copies until midnight and then woke up at 4.30 AM to read and record his notes for more than fifty years of his political life. These qualities are testimony to the remarkable career of a politician who had been chief minister five times, was elected 12 times to the Tamil Nadu assembly and once to the erstwhile Tamil Nadu legislative council. Among the qualities that endeared him to friends, critics and political foes were his accessibility and ability to face criticism without bitterness and listen to different perspectives even if he disagreed with them.
Karunanidhis role in national politics deserves more attention than it drew during his active political years. As an advocate of state autonomy, he put up stiff resistance to authoritarian rule by then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the dark and brutal Emergency of 1975-77 without worrying about the consequences that included the dismissal of the DMK government and imprisonment of party leaders, including his son, MK Stalin. The role of party newspaper Murasoli and Karunanidhis craft for communicating resistance against the Emergency and the draconian MISA will remain etched in the annals of struggles against political tyranny in the country.
The post-Emergency years and the rise of MG Ramachandran after the DMK split in 1972 led to the diminishing of political fortunes for the party. Though Karunanidhi could never wrest power from MGR and the AIADMK for as long as MGR was alive, he steadfastly refused to see a halo around MGRs larger-than-life persona. Karunanidhi survived almost 13 years in active politics as leader of the opposition after serving as chief minister twice and kept the hopes of his party and cadre alive because of his ideological strength, organisational skills and mobilisational strategies until the return of DMK to power in 1989.
It was during the launch of the National Front in Chennai in October 1988 that Karunanidhi reinvented himself in national politics. He supported VP Singh and his announcement of the Mandal Commission Report with a call for social justice. With the onset of the coalition era in Indian politics, Karunanidhi never looked back. His role in the launching of National Front in October 1988 is a turning point in altering the bipolar national political scenario into a multi-level coalitional strategy in which Karunanidhi played excellent host and strategist in knitting together the seven-party National Front at Chennai.
PARLIAMENT ADJOURNS
In a departure from tradition, Parliament adjourned for the day as the session started, in tribute to Karunanidhi.A five-time Chief Minister and a 13-time lawmaker, Karunanidhi had never been a Member of Parliament.
After obituary references, both Houses of Parliament adjourned. While it is a convention for Parliament to adjourn to pay respects to departed members -- present and former -- the honour had never been extended to a non-member before.
The Centre had announced a day's national mourning for Karunanidhi.
In his tribute to Karunanidhi, actor-politician Shatrughan Sinha had tweeted: "We appeal to the people of Tamilnadu in particular to maintain calm/peace & the nation (read Parliament) in general to announce a national mourning befitting the persona & stature of Karunanidhi. May the departed soul RIP!"
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other political leaders are heading for Chennai to pay their respects to Karunanidhi.
SONIA GANDHI MOURNS
UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi termed the death of DMK patriarch M.Karunanidhi as a "personal loss", saying he was like a "father figure" to her and the country had become poorer without his wise statesmanship.
In a letter to Karunanidhi's son MK Stalin, she said 'Kalaignar' was a towering figure in the world of politics and public service in both Tamil Nadu and the country.
"For me, Kalaignar's loss is very personal. He always showed me great kindness and consideration, which I can never forget. He was like a father figure to me," she wrote.
"We shall not see the like of Kalaignar again, and our nation is poorer without his wise statesmanship, and his dedication to our country and our people," she also said.
The former Congress president said Karunanidhi was a brilliant literary figure who did so much to promote Tamil Nadu's rich and distinctive culture and arts, and brought worldwide recognition for it.
"His decades at the helm of Tamil Nadu's government and politics have left a superb and enduring legacy, for which he will forever be honoured and remembered. I believe he had full confidence that you would nurture and take forward his legacy," she said in her letter.
"Throughout his long and magnificent life, he stood unwavering for social justice and equality, for the development, progress and prosperity of Tamil Nadu, and for the well-being of every single citizen, especially the poorest and most marginalised," she also said.
Sharing the grief with his entire family, Sonia Gandhi said Karunanidhi lived a long and wonderfully fulfilled life and is now released from suffering. She also lauded Stalin for looking after his father well and with "utmost devotion" during his illness.
ARDENT CRICKET FAN
Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Karunanidhi wore several hats during his life. A poet, dramatist, script-writer and most importantly a noted politician in the history of independent India. Along with all these things, the DMK patriarch was also an ardent cricket fan.
According to a report on NewsMinute, Karunanidhi skipped several meetings and appointments to watch the Indian team play and was moved by Sachin Tendulkars retirement speech.
He would somehow adjust meetings, or even cancel them, one of his staff members was quoted by The News Minute.
After the government decided to honour Tendulkar with the Bharat Ratna, Karunanidhi had said, You (Sachin) have walked into history and history is bejewelled by your presence. It is quite natural that the Government of India has announced the Bharat Ratna for you in recognition of your unmatched records. You have set grand standards.
The report also says that Karunanidhi was a fan of former Indian captain Kapil Dev. But his favourite cricketer was Chennais adopted son Mahendra Singh Dhoni, the captain of the popular Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Chennai Super Kings. He made it a habit to watch CSK matches to catch a glimpse of Dhoni. However, he was forced to stop going to the stadium after a surgery.
Back in 2011, when India won the ICC World Cup, the stalwart awarded captain Dhoni and the team a prize money of three crore rupees. Also, he awarded Ravichandran Ashwin, a Chennai boy, a sum of one crore.
He was also very fond of former Indian captain and opener Krishnamachari Srikkanth, who also hails from Chennai.
The report also mentioned that Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan, who is married to a Tamil Nadu girl, was a frequent visitor to the Karunanidhi household.
Whether it was the electoral alliance with the Congress-I led by Indira Gandhi in 1972 or the BJP-led NDA coalition in 1998, Karunanidhi made and unmade alliances based on electoral fortunes than political convictions. He treated allies and rivals alike unequivocally like a seasoned gardener cutting, trimming, and shifting seeds of fortune in the thorny bushes of Indian politics. With his passing away, politics in Tamil Nadu awaits a generational change as time carries away a warrior of Dravidian politics and the last among the giants of first-generation Tamil Nadu politicians after independence.
Karunanidhi leaves his party secure in the hands of his son MK Stalin and the state uncertain with the BJP threatening to alter the political discourse.
The political message is clear: This is not the end of Dravidian parties in Tamil Nadu, but a shifting of focus towards civil society movements.
The battle lines are being redrawn.

Lancashire beat Yorkshire in Roses derby
LONDON, Thursday - Lancashire cruised to a six-wicket win over Yorkshire as they chased down 181-9 to go above their Roses rivals and into third place in the North Group.
David Willey hit 80 from 43 balls for Yorkshire but they lost six wickets and only scored 40 in the last six overs.
Lancs set the groundwork for victory through Alex Davies (34), Karl Brown (51) and Arron Lilley (47). And they reached 185-4 with little fuss for a win which sends them two points clear of fifth-placed Warwickshire.
Elsewhere in the North Group Joe Clarke scored a wonderful 76 as Worcestershire defended a total of 137-8 to beat Derbyshire by 16 runs and return to the top of the table by a point from Durham.
Clarke hit nine fours and three sixes in scoring more than half of his sides runs, but fellow opener Wayne Parnell (12) was the only other man to reach double figures.
In reply, Billy Godleman top-scored with 38, but Luke Wood, Patrick Brown and Ed Barnard all took two wickets as the Worcs retained control to secure their eighth win in this seasons competition. Ian Bell inspired Warwickshire to a comfortable six-wicket win over holders Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston to move above their opponents, as well as Derbyshire, and up to fifth spot,
Bell, who this week stated his desire to get back into the England Test set-up, scored 54 from 37 balls as his side made light work of surpassing the visitors total of 152-4. Colin de Grandhomme finished unbeaten on 49 as they reached 156-4 with 22 balls to spare.
In the South Group, Gloucestershire moved up to second place as Ian Cockbains magnificent 123 helped them amass 242-4 on their way to an emphatic 70-run win against Middlesex. Cockbains maiden T20 ton came at better than two runs a ball and included ten fours and six sixes.
Middlesex could only manage 172-6 from their 20 overs, with Kieran Noema-Barnett (3-18) dismissing England batsmen Eoin Morgan and Dawid Malan during his miserly spell.
Fifth-placed Surreys match against sixth-placed Sussex at the Oval fell victim to a combination of the rain and threat of lightning.

Former Sri Lanka cricketers Mahela Jayawardene, Sidath Wettimuny and Roger Wijesuriya, along with Jayantha Seneviratne and Carlton Bernadus have been included into a committee set up by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam to foster and develop junior school cricket.
The Minister made this disclosure at a Cricket Skills Development Programme organized by the Ministry of Sports yesterday.
Jayawardene conducted the topic Graduation of a Youngster of School Cricket and further said that he discovered junior players were using the regular cricket ball for matches which he got changed to suit the junior age group like it was during his junior days. Its not good to use regular balls in these age groups because they cant learn anything technically, said Jayawardene.
We need to uplift the technical standard from the early stages. I played nearly 20 years of international cricket and during these years international cricket has changed a lot. Our school cricket system is far better compared to other countries but we have failed to win the junior World Cup, he said.
I believe we are facing a lack of technical knowledge and team plans in school level cricket we should no more concerned on these aspects and develop school cricket. We need to focus more on the technical aspects in the future.

Qatar Ambassador under spotlight
Qatar Ambassador A.S.P. Liyanage was hauled over the coal yesterday in Parliament for his involvement in the matter in relation to Stafford Sri Lanka School in Doha.
UNP MP Ashoka Priyantha moved the adjournment debate on the matter where both MPs from government and the Opposition demanded quick action against the Ambassador.
Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister in a statement stated that the Foreign Ministry awaits further directives from President Maithripala Sirisena to solve the issue with regards to Sri Lankan Ambassodor in Qatar A.S.P. Liyanage obstructing the work in Stafford Sri Lanka school in Doha. The statement was read out to the House by the Leader of the House Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
During the Cabinet meeting held on August 7, 2018 State Foreign Affairs Minister Wasantha Senanayake, in his capacity as the acting Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando requested from the President for another meeting with the relevant parties to settle the issue for good. We await another meeting scheduled to be given by the President in due course, the statement said.
According to the statement, a meeting was held on May 28, 2018 which was convened by Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister, headed by President Sirisena along with the attendance of the Ambassador Liyanage, Chairman of the School, the Board of Directors and the Trustees.
The statement further said that at this meeting, President has instructed that no action should be taken until further directives are issued to resolve the issue.
However, it appears that further directives were not issued to the Foreign Ministry up to date. it also said.
Minister Kiriella after reading out the statement made his observations on the matter in concern. I hope that all parties involved in the matter will put their heads together and find a solution to this problem. he said.
Further speaking, Minister Kiriella said the school in concern is a blessing for Sri Lankans who are employed in Qatar, and said that it has helped to keep around 1000 families together, who otherwise would have been living in separate countries.
The President should intervene in the matter and save this school. Even the Qatar government was very impressed by this school that they donated two acres of land to expand the school premises. That is the esteem with which this school is held. Minister Kiriella added.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti, joining the adjournment motion, pointed out that Sri Lankan government and Foreign Ministry should swiftly act to secure the school.
It is not just saving a school, but it is a matter of securing the honour of our country, he pointed out. MP Handunnetti alleged that Foreign Minister and Deputy Foreign Minister are evading the matter and expressed his disappointment over the delay in solving the matter as well.
He also said that it is the responsibility of the Foreign Ministry to officially inform about this issue to Qatar government. Handunnetti demanded the Foreign Ministry and the government to make an official statement expressing the stance they take on this matter.
If there were misdeeds in that school, there are so many ways to figure them out and take actions against.
Why this ambassador poked his finger into that He has no power to do so. This person has clearly violated his diplomatic powers so he should not be given the immunity further. MP Handunnetti observed.
The United National Party MP Ashoka Priyantha moving the adjournment motion regarding the matter said Ambassador Liyanage had intervened in the activities of the said school violating his powers.
Therefore, the Foreign Affairs Ministry should take an immediate action against this Ambassador, Priyantha said.

Rajiv Gandhi killers cant be freed, Indian Govt. tells SC
NEW DELHI Aug 10: The seven Rajiv Gandhi assassination convicts jailed in Tamil Nadu cannot be released, the government told the Supreme Court yesterday, asserting that the case involves the assassination of a former Prime Minister.
The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was a most heinous and brutal crime, the government said, one which had brought the Indian democratic process to a grinding halt as general and state elections had to be postponed.
The murder of an ex-PM was an act unparalleled in the annals of crime committed in the country, said the Centre.
The CBI, which investigated the case, has opposed the release of the seven convicts.
Tamil Nadu had been informed of the decision on April 18, the centre said.
The convicts - Perarivalan, Murugan, Santham, Nalini Sriharan, Robert Payas, Jayakumar and Ravichandran - have been in jail for 27 years, serving life terms.
The court had asked the centre to decide and respond to Tamil Nadus request to release them. A Constitution Bench of top Supreme Court judges had said in 2015 that the convicts cannot be released without the central governments consent.
Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991 by a woman operative of the separatist Lankan Tamil outfit LTTE, who greeted him at a rally in Sriperumbudur town with a bomb strapped to her chest.
In April, the Madras High Court rejected Nalini Sriharans request for early release. Her death sentence was commuted on the request of Congress leader Sonia Gandhi, the wife of Rajiv Gandhi.
Another convict, Perarivalan, had requested that the case be reopened and his conviction be cancelled. The Supreme Court rejected it in March.
Perarivalan, 19 at the time, was convicted for supplying two nine-volt batteries for the belt-bomb. He told a court that he had no idea what the batteries were for.
Congress President Rahul Gandhi, the son of Rajiv Gandhi, had said he had no objection to Perarivalans release, Tamil film director PA Ranjith was quoted as saying recently.
The assassination, the trial and the convicts have been an emotive subject in Tamil Nadu over the years, key to the campaigns of the two main parties in the state, the ruling AIADMK and the opposition DMK. Many in Tamil Nadu believe that the convicts played minor roles and were drawn into a plot they knew little about.
In 2014, then Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa decided to release the convicts but the centre - the Congress-led government was in power - challenged her decision. The Supreme Court then said the state could not take such a decision without the centres sanction, as the case was investigated by the CBI.- NDTV

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya gives ruling:
SAMPANTHAN TO REMAIN OPPOSITION LEADER
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday ruled out any changes to the Opposition Leaders post in Parliament reinforcing the legitimacy of TNA Leader R. Sampanthan holding the post.
Making a special announcement at the commencement of sittings yesterday, the Speaker said that his final decision is that the Constitutionality and Parliament tradition does not warrant any change in the post of Opposition Leader.
The Speaker however assured that he would allocate more time and grant more space in Parliamentary Committees for the Joint Opposition (JO) to be fair with the numbers it is representing.
The Speakers ruling was with reference to the JOs special written request on August 1 to offer the Opposition Leader post to JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena. The JO demanded the post claiming that it had the support of 70 MPs.
The Speaker in a detailed statement said his ruling was after a the careful study of the composition of current Parliament and international best practices. He said all arguments made on the floor of the House last Tuesday on the post of Opposition Leader and opinions of experts on Parliamentary democracy were considered in arriving at his final decision.
The Speaker made it clear that the Opposition Leader post must be held by a person who is not from a political party now in the Government. He pointed to the Parliamentary Resolution adopted on September 3, 2015 which clearly states that the UNP and UPFA are partners of a National Government.
The Speaker pointed out the context in which MP Nimal Siripala de Silva served as the Opposition Leader during the interim period after January 8, 2015 was different to the present context as there had not been such a Parliamentary Resolution of a National Government then.
He explained that the Parliamentary Group Leader of a recognized political party that does not represent the Government and has the highest number of seats is the rightful owner of the Opposition Leader post.
He noted that Sri Lankan and UK Parliamentary tradition as well as precedence are clear in this regard.
However, MPs Dinesh Gunwardena, Chandima Weerakkody and Dullas Alahapperuma spoke against the Speakers decision, but the Speaker said that his ruling should be considered final and thus it cannot be debated.
MP Alahapperuma questioned whether the Speaker will change the decision if the JO MPs leave the UPFA and become independent. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella replied that the JO MPs should first become independent for the House to consider such a request.

Shahzaib Hasans ban for spot-fixing upped to four years
LAHORE Friday: An independent adjudicator Friday increased the ban on Pakistan's World Twenty20-winning opener Shahzaib Hasan from one year to four on appeal from the country's cricket board.
Hasan, 28, was banned in February this year after being found guilty of not disclosing a fixing offer to the anti-corruption unit of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
He was also fined one million rupees ($8,200).
The PCB had appealed the length of the ban, saying it was too lenient. The independent adjudicator Justice (retired) Hamid Hussain has accepted (the) PCB's appeal and lifted the ban to four years while upholding the fine, the board's legal adviser Taffazul Rizvi told media.
Spot-fixing refers to illegal activity in a sport where a specific part of a game is fixed, unlike match-fixing, where the whole result is fixed. Shahzaib is one of six players sanctioned in the spot-fixing case which rocked the second edition of Pakistan Super League last year, a Twenty20 tournament. Swashbuckling opener Sharjeel Khan, Khalid Latif, Mohammad Irfan, Mohammad Nawaz, and Nasir Jamshed were also given bans of varying lengths.
Jamshed is also charged with other breaches and faces a life ban, a decision likely to be announced next week. Hasan's lawyer Kashif Rajwana said his client is likely to challenge the decision in court.
Hasan played the last of his three one-day internationals in November 2010. He has also played 10 Twenty20 internationals for Pakistan, including the World Twenty20 which Pakistan won in 2009.
Hasan, like Jamshed, now lives in the UK. AFP

This Test match showed why cricket is the beautiful game
I despair for those who dont care for cricket (although I suspect that might be the majority of readers). For you will have missed over the past four days not just one of the great Test matches, but also one that reveals what sport is about and why so many are obsessed by it.
England played India at Edgbaston in a match that twisted and turned more than a Le Carr plot and was far tenser.
Sport may be about winning but it is also about drama. Every game tells a story, in fact, myriad stories, with villains and heroes, tension and catharsis, struggle and redemption. And no sport embodies drama as much as cricket. Many find it unbelievable that a Test match can last five days. But thats what helps write plots that often feel like fiction. Complaining that a Test match lasts five days is a bit like moaning that War and Peace lasts 1,200 pages. Its no accident that so many great dramatists  Beckett, Pinter, Stoppard, Ayckbourn, Rattigan  have been drawn to the game.
None of this will mean much to non-cricket fans. Increasingly, it means less to cricket fans too. Cricket has now effectively become two games. The long game of the Test match, watched by fewer and fewer spectators. And the attention-grabbing, biff, bang, wallop of T20, full of excitement but too little drama. Four days in Edgbaston revealed what would be lost if Tests disappeared. It was a game full of brilliant individual moments, of brave play and braver decisions. But above all was the emotional tension of a game that one never knew how it would end.
I started writing this as play opened on Saturday morning with India needing 84 runs to win and England five wickets. I am finishing just as Ben Stokes takes the fifth wicket to win the game for England. Its been an exhausting hour and a half. And not because of the writing.  theguardian

A timely request
This week, we have seen a number of strikes by various groups that severely affected the public. Doctors struck work apparently in protest against the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore while railway workers staged a strike over a salary anomaly. Other trade unions are also reported to be planning strikes over various issues.
While the Government is the presumed target of these wildcat strikes, the pithy Sinhala saying Vidde hawata, vedune pandurata (Arrow aimed at hare, but struck the bush) amply illustrates what actually happens - by trying to put pressure on the Government, the strikers really hurt the public  especially the Middle Class and the poor. When the doctors strike, the rich do not care  they can simply walk into the nearest private hospital. On the other hand, poor patients who have no money to spend on private hospitals have to go home empty handed, after having waited for hours in deserted Government hospitals for doctors to turn up. When railway workers strike, the rich do not care. They just use the car anyway. Again, it is the common masses who suffer as they have no other mode of transport, the bus service being minimal in some areas.
These are the same sentiments expressed by President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday, when he stated that those who strike to win over their rights should also think about the rights of the public in a humane manner. It is not the government but the innocent public that is inconvenienced by these strikes, President Sirisena rightly said. The President stressed that it was the innocent poor rather than the wealthy that mostly benefit by public transport and free health services. As the President noted, the striking railway workers should at least have thought about the students sitting for the GCE A/L examination who have been severely inconvenienced.
It is obvious beyond any doubt that strikers are exploiting the prevailing atmosphere of freedom sans fear and suspicion to organise strikes at will. During the previous regime, just one telephone call from a much-feared and powerful official ensured that strikes were never even thought of and if they did begin by any chance, the fear of the white van stopped them from proceeding any further. And we all know how blood was spilled during several strikes and demonstrations in Katunayake, Rathupaswala and elsewhere.
This was exactly the main thrust of the Presidents appeal to all trade unions - unlike during the past regime, the present Good Governance Government had never used guns or bayonets against strikers or protestors. In fact, there have been no fatalities or even serious injuries at any demonstration held after January 2015. However, as Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said recently, this adherence to democratic principles should not be interpreted as a sign of weakness.
The President pointed out an alternative path for all strikes  discussions and negotiations. He requested railway employees, doctors and other professional groups planning strikes to try and resolve their problems in an intelligent and humane manner without inconveniencing the public. There have been many calls over the years to make health and transport essential services and to outlaw strikes in these sectors. It is time the Government seriously looked at this proposal.
We should remember that there are certain categories of Government employees who can never strike even if they want to  mainly the personnel of the Armed Forces and the Police. They are Government Servants who have sacrificed their life and limb to ensure a brighter future for the rest of the population, without any complaints. Some of them still serve in very remote, harsh areas amidst limited facilities. But do they ever complain No.
We should also keep in mind that there are thousands of people among us who do not have any form of employment. Those who strike over higher pay and other issues should ponder for a moment on the fact that there are many who do not have a job at all. Indeed, Government Servants must always think of their responsibilities and duties towards the public. As the President emphasized, dedication, contribution and honesty on the part of all sections of society are essential to usher in a national re-awakening.
There is also a new trend where trade unions strike over issues that should not concern them at all. The GMOA is striking over the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA, but a question arises as to the doctors qualifications to comment and decide on this issue. They are not experts in economics or foreign policy after all. Earlier, a transport union launched a strike over the issue of SAITM  again, that union had no expertise in the area of education. Stern action should be taken against unions that try to meddle in Government policy on matters outside their purview or expertise.
Frequent strikes give our country a band name and drive away potential investors. They adversely affect the economy and severely inconvenience the public. The authorities must deal firmly with striking unions without descending to the dark depths of 2005-2014 to minimize the hassles faced by the public.

Tokyo 2020 Olympics to introduce facial recognition technology
The Tokyo 2020 Olympic committee said that it will use facial recognition to improve safety and speed up security lines for participants -- a priority in the face of a record heatwave.
Around 300,000 accredited individuals, including athletes, officials, staff and press, are expected to attend the games between July and August 2020. All will have their facial images stored in a database and matched upon entry.
The software, provided by NEC Corporation, will enable swift entry to venues, which will be necessary in the intense heat of summer, said Tokyo 2020 security chief Tsuyoshi Iwashita. This latest technology will enable strict identification of accredited people compared with relying solely on the eyes of security staff, he noted, adding that the measures would detect spoofing, forgery, and the use of lost or stolen credentials. Keeping lines short during the summer games is a great concern to organizers currently facing dangerous levels of heat in Japan. Since April 30, a reported 70,000 people have been hospitalized and 138 killed in heat-related illnesses across the country.
The announcement follows a report from Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun that the government was considering moving clocks two hours forward next summer to combat heat as a test ahead of the games.
KILLER HEATWAVE
Temperatures have been almost 11 degrees hotter than the average at this time of year  the mercury rising to over 41 degrees (105.8F), he highest ever on record in Japan -- in the city of Kumagaya, a short drive from the capital.
The heat has led to cancelling of large events such as the Hanagasa Junko parade, the second largest event of the Gion Matsuri festival.
The heatwave prompted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to outline the detailed heat countermeasures its planning in order to protect athletes, fans and workers in Tokyo.
You will see the first step has already been reflected in the competition schedule, with specific events held at certain times to ensure the well-being of athletes, said an IOC spokeperson in a statement sent to CNN.
Steps are being taken to reduce the risks, with trees planted around the course to offer shade and mist-spraying technologies implemented to cool spectators.
In recent days Tokyo and Japan has been like living in a sauna every day, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said on Monday. - CNN

Tourism tops in Anuradhapura's five-year development plan
Tourism industry in the Anuradhapura district will get a prominent place under the regional five-year development plan, Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told Daily News.
Crop, fisheries, forestry, industry, education, health, social services and infra structure will be other sectors to be developed under the five-year plan, he said.
Wanninayake said the UNDP and the European Union along with the ILO, UNICEF, UNOPS, FAO and IFC fund to carry out the plan. Thousands of tourists visit Anuradhapura daily and the area has potential to be a grand tourist destination. Many more restaurants, guide and transport services and other business that attract tourists can be set up in the area. Wanninayke said the number of people employed in the sector is vague since relevant statistics are unavailable.
The five-year plan mainly focuses on developing infrastructure facilities for tourism sector. roads, restaurants, lodges, and tourist attractions will be developed to gain more income from the sector, the GA said. He said many hotels charge high rates from tourists for poor-quality accommodation and such activities affect the industry. Land should be allocated to build modern tourist facilities and those who encroach on State lands should be discouraged, he said.
He said 1,798,380 tourists arrived in Sri Lanka in 2015 and the number is increasing now.

Trains operate despite TU action
The Sri Lanka Railways managed to operate nine trains from Colombo Fort and Maradana last evening too, despite trade union action launched by several unions.
According to Railways Additional General Manager Wijaya Samarasinghe, several trains bound for Mirigama, Kandy, Matara, Puttalam, Avissawella, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa left Colombo Fort from yesterday morning.
He said that several office trains were also in operation last evening despite Locommotive Train Drivers Associations warning that they would stop the few trains presently in operation. Thousands of commuters were stranded due to sudden wild cat strike launched by several trade unions and traffic on the road opposite the Fort Railway Station came to a standstill for several hours, as angry commuters staged a protest blocking the road on Wednesday. Protesting commuters demanded the government to take stern action against the trade union officials who are trying to win their petty demands at the hands of innocent commuters.

US airstrikes to counter major Taliban attack in Afghanistan
AFGHANISTAN: US forces launched airstrikes yesterday to counter a major Taliban assault on an Afghan provincial capital, where terrified residents cowered in their homes amid explosions and gunfire as security forces try to beat the insurgents back.
Officials said Afghan special forces were also being deployed to the southeastern city of Ghazni after the latest attempt by the Taliban to capture an urban centre, with the assault coming as pressure builds on the insurgents to enter peace talks.
At least one Afghan soldier has been killed and seven others wounded in the fighting, provincial governor spokesman Arif Noori said.
Civilian houses and army checkpoints have come under mortar attack and the bodies of dozens of Taliban fighters are in the streets, he added.
The Taliban began the attack late Thursday from several positions around the city, provincial police chief Farid Ahmad Mashal said.
Residents who spoke to AFP said power has been cut to the area since fighting erupted, with heavy gunfire ringing out across the city and a government building set on fire.
We are scared for our life. The Taliban are roaming everywhere in and around the city, shopkeeper Mohammad Haleem told AFP.
Another resident, Yasan, said the Taliban were using loudspeakers at the mosque to warn residents to stay in their homes.
Heavy explosions and gunfire can be heard. We are terrified, Yasan wrote in a Facebook post.
The US said that the city remained under government control.
U.S. Forces responded with close-air support this morning in #Ghazni, the official account for US Forces in Afghanistan tweeted Friday.
Afghan forces held their ground and maintain control of all govt. centers. Another failed attempt by Taliban to seize terrain, while creating strategically inconsequential headlines, it continued. A spokesman for President Ashraf Ghani said the Taliban had suffered heavy casualties in the onslaught and confirmed the airstrikes.
Commando forces are on their way, and black hawks are hitting important enemy targets, wrote Shahhussain Murtazawi in a post on social media. Police special forces have also been deployed to help block the Taliban advance on the city, an Afghan security official said.
The Taliban issued a statement claiming to have captured most of the government buildings inside the city.
So far 140 enemy forces have been killed or wounded, the group said.
The Taliban frequently exaggerate their battlefield gains and downplay losses incurred during fighting.
Afghan forces have been struggling to hold back the resurgent militant group since the withdrawal of NATO combat troops at the end of 2014.
In May the Taliban attacked the western city of Farah. After a day of intense fighting, Afghan commandos and US air strikes drove the group to the outskirts of the city.
The insurgents have also so far ignored an offer by Ghani in February of unconditional peace negotiations.
However there are tentative signs that diplomatic efforts to bring the insurgents to the table for peace talks may be starting to bear fruit.
The Taliban has long insisted on direct talks with the United States. Washington has repeatedly refused, saying negotiations must be Afghan-led.
But Washington indicated a change in its longstanding policy in June when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was prepared to support, facilitate and participate in talks.
Pompeo also said the role of foreign forces in Afghanistan would be on the table.
Last month Taliban representatives met US officials for talks in Qatar.
Anticipation has also been mounting about the possibility of a government ceasefire announcement for the Islamic holiday of Eid-al Adha later this month.
An unprecedented truce in June brought fighting between security forces and the Taliban to a temporary halt, giving war-weary Afghans some welcome relief from violence.

Venezuela: President escapes assassination
It was 5.41 p.m. on August 4. Venezuelan president Nicols Maduro was addressing a parade at Bolivar Avenue in Caracas to mark the 81st anniversary of the Bolivarian National Guard.
Two drones identified as DJM600s carrying C4 explosives were approaching the presidential rostrum of the parade. One exploded in the air, probably shot down by the presidents security detail, while the other veered off and crashed into a nearby residential building.
It was clearly an attempt to assassinate President Maduro. Though the President was unharmed seven members of the National Guard were injured. Venezuelas Interior Minister, Nestor Reverol claimed the government thwarted the attack using special techniques and [radio] signal inhibitors, which disoriented the drone that detonated closest to the presidential stand.
There was widespread condemnation of the attack throughout the world. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned the attack.
The secretary-general is concerned about the latest developments in Venezuela and rejects any act of violence, said Farhan Haq, Guterres deputy spokesman. Nicaragua, Cuba, Uruguay, Bolivia, El Salvador, various Caribbean island nations, and the regional ALBA bloc repudiated the attack. Russia, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Vietnam and India were among the other nations that condemned it.
The US government did not condemn the attack and instead said that there was no US government involvement. It also put forward a ludicrous claim that the attack could have been engineered by the Venezuelan government itself!
The Venezuelan president accused outgoing Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos of being behind the attempt on his life.
According to the Venezuelan Attorney General 19 persons were involved in the attack. President Maduro announced he would use the countrys international accords to request the extradition of at least five people, including a former colonel, who has been implicated in the terror attack and is currently living in the United States or Colombia.
Three persons - Argenis Valero, Juan Carlos Monasterios and Jos Rivas detainees detained a few hours after the attack, were produced in court and charged with treason and murder. The prosecutor alleged financiers of the crime are located abroad and steps are already being taken to capture and extradite him.
Among them he named retired colonel of the Bolivarian National Guard Oswaldo Garcia, who reside in Colombia, as well as Osman Delgado, who lives in the United States as two of the financiers.
President Maduro has also alleged the former President of Venezuelas National Assembly Julio Borges who lives in a mansion in Bogota protected by the outgoing government of Colombia, was involved in the attack.
Meanwhile, a former police chief Salvatore Lychees, who is also in Bogota, also claimed to have played a role in the attack and warned of others in a televised interview. We had an objective, and at the moment we were not able to materialize it 100 percent The armed struggle will continue.
Pakistans foreign policy challenges
The new government in Pakistan is faced with considerable challenges in its foreign policy. Relations between Pakistan and the United States had deteriorated fast, especially after President Trump came to power. Indo-Pakistan relations too had deteriorated and the Kashmir problem has aggravated. During the election campaign Imran Khan was critical of the relations with China.
However, indications are that the new government will tread cautiously in the foreign policy front. Prime Minister Imran Khan stated that the first priority is to consolidate the good relations with China, which is crucial for Pakistans prosperity. He also softened his stance on India and the United States. Imran Khan correctly stated the premise of the relationship between the India and Pakistan should not be conflict but poverty alleviation for one of the largest poverty-stricken populations in the world. He called for dialogue instead of confrontation.
With regard to US-Pakistan relations he said that they should be balanced and based on mutual respect. It is also significant that Pakistan is distancing itself from the earlier pro-US stand and is trying to be more independent in its foreign policy. Relations with Russia seem to be improving. Last Tuesday the two countries signed an agreement to train Pakistan defense officials in Russia which could result in changed perceptions on world developments. Voice of America commented that the Russians are keen to step in and fill the gap which the United States has created after halting security-related aid to Pakistan. The inaugural meeting of Russia-Pakistan Joint Military Consultative Committee met in Rawalpindi recently where the talks were headed by Defence Secretary Zamirul Hassan Shah and visiting Russian Deputy Defence Minister Col Gen Alexander Fomin. Pakistan and Russia had signed a defense cooperation agreement in 2014.

Young athletes should stay hydrated, but too much water can be deadly
With August football practice fast approaching, every coachs favorite cheer will be to stay hydrated and keep urine clear during the summer heat.
In 2017, a University of Texas football coach created a urine-based Longhorn Football Hydration Chart, which labeled players with yellow urine as selfish teammates and those with brown urine as bad guys. This hydration shaming practice has permeated high school sports, thereby encouraging a sporting culture which equates superior performance with superior hydration.
Overzealous obedience to this hydration advice has uncovered a dark underbelly to superior hydration practices: overhydration. When high school football player Walker Wilbanks died in Mississippi in August 2014 from overhydration, the doctor said that the cause of death was an unpredictable freak occurrence.
Two weeks prior, another high school football player from Georgia drank two gallons of water and two gallons of Gatorade after football practice to prevent muscle cramps and then died. Thus, over the last four years, two high school football players have died during August football practice from overhydrating -- a medical condition known as exercise-associated hyponatremia.
Conversely, no football player has ever been known to die from dehydration, although seven died during this same four-year period from heatstroke, which may be related, but not always.
How do I know about that overhydration kills athletes I watched runners almost die after drinking 100 cups of water during a marathon because they were scared of becoming dehydrated. So, I got interested in thirst.
Turns out, the neuroendocrine thirst circuit dates back 700 million years and is found in most animals, including bugs and worms. Thirst activates the same conscious area of the brain that tells us were hungry or have to pee. To say we need to stay ahead of thirst (or die) is like saying we need to pee every hour to stay ahead of imminent bladder explosion (or die). The molecular and neural circuits that govern fluid intake (and micturition) in real-time are absolutely exquisite.
Its remarkable to think that animals survive without water bottles and urine charts -- they drink when they are thirsty, and we should too.
TOO MUCH WATER, TOO LITTLE SALT
Hyponatremia is caused by drinking too much water or sports drinks, which dilutes blood salt levels below the normal range. Any sudden drop in blood salt levels, from drinking more than the body can excrete, can cause all cells in the body to swell. Brain swelling from hyponatremia can cause headaches and vomiting, while muscle cell swelling can trigger whole-body muscle cramping.
What is most frightening, however, is that these symptoms mimic those of dehydration. They are often treated by medical staff with more fluids.
So, which hydration imbalance -- dehydration and overhydration -- is the lesser of two evils
Dehydration is undeniably harmful to human health and performance. Wrestlers have died from trying to make weight, through vigorous dehydration practices. A recent meta-analysis of 33 studies verified that more than 2 percent dehydration impairs cognition. Dehydration can impair performance and increase core body temperature, as per the American College of Sports Medicines latest position statement. All of these statements underscore the vital importance of staying hydrated.
But I fear that many coaches ignore the finer points that support those conclusions.
For example, three wrestlers who died of dehydration rapidly lost about 15 percent of body weight by withholding fluids while exercising in a hot environment in a rubber suit. Similarly, to achieve 3 percent dehydration, which impairs cognition, individuals need to withhold fluids for 24 hours. And thats without exercise.
These dehydration protocols do not necessarily represent free-living situations. When hikers die from dehydration in the desert, most if not all had become lost or had run out of fluids. Thus, thirst -- or the deep-seated desire for water -- is rarely broken when healthy people die from dehydration. Morbidity and mortality occur when there is no fluid available, fluids are withheld, as in lab studies, or when athletes refuse to drink for other reasons, such as making weight.
WHEN DO ATHLETES AND OTHERS NEED TO DRINK
So how much fluid should football players -- and all other humans for that matter -- drink If you ask fluid balance experts who perform basic science research on the brain or kidney, or clinicians who specialize in fluid balance disorders, researchers who perform brain scans on dehydrated and overhydrated humans, or even worm investigators, they all agree that water balance is tightly regulated and that all land mammals need to drink when thirsty.
Drinking when you are thirsty is not too late, because the thirst mechanism is hardwired into the nervous system to protect against scarcity. Thirst represents the highly individualized signal which protects the balance between water and salt regardless of size, activity or ambient temperature and is encoded in most invertebrate and all vertebrate DNA. Babies are born with this innate behavioral drive.
Then, what about the need for eight glasses of water per day There is no evidence to support this. What about peeing until our urine is clear Dark colored urine merely reflects water conservation by the kidney, rather than water lack by the body.
WHATS A FOOTBALL PLAYER TO DO
Football players absolutely need water, but they should be warned not to overdo it.
In the modern era, where fluid is widely available, in order to stay adequately hydrated, the following must occur:
A variety of fluids needs to be freely available to football players, and
The players should be given the freedom to drink whenever they feel thirsty.
And when the players get hot, they need the opportunity to pour generous amounts of ice water over their heads instead of into their mouths to promote evaporative cooling, rather than dilute sodium levels. Better yet, they should be allowed to go inside and cool off.
We should recognize who the true champions may be with regards to most modern day hydration advice. According to the latest figures, bottled water sales have increased to US $18.5 billion, up 8.8 percent from the previous year. This revenue does not include the vast array of purified, infused, oxygenized, sparkled, distilled, intravenous and reverse osmosis versions that compete for attention on the market.
While we all need water, drinking until our urine is clear is money (and water) flushed away. And with the threat of overdrinking high in motivated athletes, I ask coaches/trainers to reconsider before enforcing the urine color chart in athlete locker rooms: Is it worth the risk - CNN
