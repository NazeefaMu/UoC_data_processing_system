Jaffna Tamils consider SLFP a Tamil party
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) in Jaffna is considered a Tamil party run by Tamils, SLFP Jaffna District MP Angajan Ramanathan yesterday said as he called for the SLFP 67th Convention to be held in Jaffna next year.
Angajan was addressing a SLFP media briefing held at SLFP Headquarters at Darley Road.
He said the President had given them much freedom and autonomy within the party.
"The Jaffna people have welcomed the President with open arms," the National List MP said assuring that a Convention in Jaffna would attract a large gathering.
Responding to a query about a recent LTTE propaganda material asking Tamil women not to marry Sinhalese men, the Jaffna District MP said it was a hoax. "The Tamil people had no interest in reverting to an armed struggle," he said.
`They have suffered enough. I can assure you that no one wants another war," he said.

The 20-20 battles of current politics
While 2020 is clearly the goal of President Maithripala Sirisena in the politics of coalition governance as clearly stated at the meeting with newspaper editors and media heads earlier this week, there is a different 20 issue gathering attention in the debate on the constitutional powers of parliament. It is the proposed 20th Amendment to the Constitution, which is expected to decide on elections to the Provincial Councils.
It must be noted that the original plan for the 20th Amendment was to decide on a change in the system of voting in elections to parliament, to move away from the Proportional Representation (PR) system that is increasingly seen as contrary to the democratic process, causing massive corruption in poll campaigns and keeping Members of Parliament away from the voters. Some necessary changes have been made to the Local Government election process, but parliamentary elections need a major change to make the process more democratic and voter oriented, unlike the current PR system that is more party or pro-candidate support contributor oriented.
The issue before parliament and the public is the move by government to fix the holding of elections to all nine provincial councils on a single date. By and large a good proposal to address voters of all provinces at the same time, and reduce opportunities for corruption in single or a couple of provinces, with those in power able to focus spending and organisational strategies in limited areas. However, the proposal would lead to the delay of polls in three provinces  North Central, Eastern and Sabaragamuwa  the terms of which end on October 1 this year.
The aim of the government is to put off all PC polls till October 2019, when the term of the Uva PC ends. An adjustment in the date of polling in all PCs while acceptable in a wider context, it is certainly lacking in good political judgment to seek postponement of PC polls due in the coming months. This change in the polling dates of all PCs could certainly be done with a suitable and reasonable amendment to the prevailing laws that are part of constitutional provisions, to be effective after a reasonable period of public discussion and acceptance. But the possibility of the delay of three PC polls due later this year, has certainly raised opposition to the proposal, and given considerable strength to the Joint Oppositions charge that this shows the governments fear to face the people.
Misuse of parliamentary supremacy
What is even more objectionable in the proposed amendment is the attempt to give parliament the right to decide the date of future provincial polls. This may seem good in the context of the supremacy of parliament, but it certainly has the considerable danger of the supremacy of parliament being wholly misused, as we have seen happen. The supremacy of parliament must be understood as the temporary extension of the supremacy of the people, to those elected by the people. But, all powers of the people cannot be transferred to parliament, without the people having a decisive say in the matter.
The most glaring example of this misuse, in fact the abuse, of the sovereignty of parliament is seen in how President Mahinda Rajapaksa saw the adoption of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, giving him, and all executive presidents after him, an unlimited number of terms in office, removing the two term limit that existed. It also removed the ability of the State to have independent commissions to manage the key sectors of government. One of the key campaign slogans and demands of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena, and campaign leader the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, was the removal of the 18th Amendment. The large public support to the Common Candidate in January 2015 was, in the main, due to the pledge to rescind the 18th Amendment, because the people saw how the process of democracy could be distorted and made anti-people by such an amendment.
It is, therefore, ironic, to see a government elected to defeat the distorted and politically crooked 18th Amendment and the political leader who used that strategy of the supremacy of parliament to serve ones own needs, seek to use the same means to manipulate the electoral process to the provincial councils. The governments leaders, both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, may be correct in telling the people they should be accepted as true democrats, and would not pose the danger to democracy that Rajapaksa did. But, even presuming that is accepted, there is the danger that such a change to the constitutional process will give the opportunity for others who would follow them to use such means to distort and manipulate the democratic process.
Whatever the good intentions of the government to hold all provincial polls on one day may be, there is the persistent danger of giving a political majority in parliament the right to decide on the date of provincial polls. It is necessary to know that parliamentary majorities, although seeming to reflect the sovereignty of the people, are not necessarily democratic, and could very well be the biggest dangers to democracy, as we have seen not too long ago. The recent political battles and violence in several African countries, with national leaders extending their terms of office through parliamentary votes, adds to our own example on how a parliamentary majority could be used to defeat democracy. Thus the 20th Amendment, as proposed, certainly has to be viewed with concern, and not allowed to defeat the widening of the democratic process that began in January 2015.
The Provincial Polls that come as an extension of the democratic process, through the devolution of limited scope as achieved by the 13th Amendment, must not be manipulated or utilized in any way to endanger the democratic process; however attractive to political forces within the government. Some Provincial Councils are already showing their own objections to this move. The JVP is clearly opposed to it and the TNA will also oppose it. The possibility of obtaining a two-thirds majority is now in question. Even if this is obtained through political manoeuvres, this move will certainly call for a referendum, which the government will not be ready to face. It seems best that this 20  20 debate is abandoned in the wider interest of democracy, and not the divisive interests of party politics.
SLFP at 66
President Sirisenas moves for the government to remain in office till 2020 will see the enlivening of politics with the SLFP celebrating its 66th anniversary in Colombo, today. This is certainly the major move by Mr. Sirisena to show his own leadership of the SLFP, putting down the rival claims by the forces of the Joint Opposition, and the challenges thrown by Mahinda Rajapaksa to the leadership of the party.
President Sirisena certainly painted an interesting history of party politics in Sri Lanka, showing how breakaway groups from the SLFP and UNP had been failures in the 70 year history parliamentary politics since 1947, when the then first parliamentary elections were held. There were several leaders from both the UNP and SLFP who tried to break with the formal leadership, but failed in the process. These included Ranasinghe Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali from the UNP, and Vijaya and Chandrika Kumaratunga, and Anura Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake from the SLFP.
It is also interesting to note that Mahinda Rajapaksa, who has been making a big noise about the Rajapaksa leadership of the SLFP, and his own role in it with recent forgetfulness of leadership realities, is now conceding that those who are not with the official SLFP will have to contest from the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP) in whatever polls are due to take place  most likely the Local Government polls due in December 2017 or January 2018.
A non-alcohol driven crowd that gathers at Campbell Park today, as instructed by the party leader, will certainly have to make a really big show, doing much better than at the 64th anniversary at Anuradhapura, and the 65th at Kurunegala. Apart from the weakening, but persistent rivalry from Rajapaksa, this SLFP anniversary is also of importance to the politics of the National Government or the prevailing coalition between the UNP and SLFP. President Sirisena has made it clear there is no party in parliament that can form a government on its own, and with his own decision that the government will last till 2020, this will require new understandings between the UNP and SLFP.
This will certainly move towards fighting corruption and related exposure of the Rajapaksa Regime. President Sirisena clearly has a stronger hand in this today, and the SLFPs new celebrations will need to strengthen his hands further towards a bigger role for the Blue Flag wavers in the ruling coalition.

Bangladesh bang their bats in dressing room
To celebrate first Test victory over Australia:
After spinning Australia out and recording a famous 20-run Test win in Dhaka, Bangladeshs players celebrated in percussive fashion by creating an almighty racket in the dressing room.
The home side went 1-0 up in the two-match series with with Shakib Al Hasans second five-wicket haul of the game inspiring them to their first Test victory over Australia.
Mustafizur Rahman shared the jubilant celebrations on Twitter, as Bangladesh formed a musical ensemble in the pavilion - chanting and banging their bats against a container.
Australia have now won just two of 23 Tests in the sub continent, despite the best efforts of opener David Warner who top scored with a brilliant 112.
Set 265 for victory, the tourists battled to 244 all-out on a wearing pitch but lost a well-fought match that confounds the theory that Test cricket is dying in the region.
Obviously a great feeling, beating Australia.
A great effort by the boys, especially Shakib and Tamim were outstanding, Mushfiqur Rahim said at the post-match presentation.
If you look at our home performance, it has been pretty consistent.
Against England (last year) also, we were very close in the first test and beat them in the second test. Thats the belief we have.
I think the spinners did a great job. I thought Taijul (Islam), Miraj (Mehidy Hasan) and Shakib bowled really well in both the innings (but) I think Tamim-Shakib partnership in the first innings set up the game for us. Mushfiqur said the lower order woes that prevented Bangladesh from driving home their first-innings advantage showed there was plenty of room for improvement.
The lower order is working hard and if you see at the last few series, they are much better now, he said.
In this test, the wicket was pretty tough to bat on, that has to be said, because the top order also found it difficult to bat.
The boys showed character. All the credit goes to the bowlers, and fielders.
They did miss some (catches) but it can happen.
Hopefully well come harder at them in the next test and hopefully well seal the series.  The Telegraph

## Title: Defeat to Bangladesh was painful but hardly Australian crickets lowest ebb
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Sports
## Date: Saturday, September 2, 2017 - 01:00
Defeat to Bangladesh was painful but hardly Australian crickets lowest ebb
Lets start by clarifying what Australias loss to Bangladesh is not. Firstly, it is no disgrace. There is a reason why they have knocked off England, Sri Lanka and now Australia inside 10 months: this is a considerably improved team. They did a tremendous amount right, winning it every bit as much as Australia contributed to own their demise when placed under that intense pressure. Bangladesh earned this triumph.
To point to their ninth-placed ranking to suggest otherwise misunderstands the rolling four-year rating cycle, eternally limited by what it cannot measure  rapid improvement just like Bangladeshs.
And ignore headlines about remuneration. Sure, the hosts are paid a pittance. Governance structures here, as far as they relate to player hip-pocket returns, are far from healthy. But it is a false equivalency to conclude that Steve Smiths touring party are inherently more capable because they are banking big salaries.
What this is is a bog-standard subcontinental performance compared to what Australian cricket teams routinely produce at home. Another painful setback; one consistent with history and form. But Australian crickets lowest ebb Hardly.
Now thats out of the way, what this actually offers is confirmation this inexperienced side are not world beaters and that the India tour was all good and well, but only as a launching point. I dont know if were better than that at the moment, Steve Smith said of that prospect of dropping to sixth in those aforementioned rankings  for what little they are worth  in the event of a series whitewash.
Most urgent is redressing batting collapses in this part of the world that continue to plague more meaningful progress. At Dhaka, a fatal stumble of six wickets for 41 runs came at the moment their chase looked just about licked, alongside four-wicket slumps for 33 and 42 in the first dig.
Of course, all international batsmen log untold hours simulating what they might expect. But what cannot be replicated, until the time comes, is the pressure that infuses a mindset once one of these tremors begin. For too long the moment that it enters the Australian psyche they might have a problem, they invariably end up with a serious one. Particularly in Asia. That improvement has to be driven above the shoulders, not below.
One man who showed he has learned how to the quell chaos is David Warner, who has turned to meditation in an effort to calm himself more broadly. He adapted beautifully, said Smith of his deputy. He never let the bowler settle on a good length which is important in these conditions. The way he played with positive intent helped his defence as well. In short, he ignored where he was batting and cracked on as he would at home. The neither-here-nor-there Warner from Sri Lanka was long gone in the breakthrough innings. Specifically, when the heat was on, he did not get beaten on the inside edge as so often brought his downfall last year.
By contrast, Matthew Wade was out in single digits twice that very way. The incumbent wicketkeeper-batsman is reeling, and theres no avoiding it anymore. He has never been the most elegant gloveman, but the 30 byes he conceded  however brutal the track and how hard he worked in the horrible humidity  came at the worst possible time. More to the point, in the modern game consistent runs need to come from No7, and with one half-century in nine Tests since his recall, they arent being delivered by Wade. With the urgency of victory in Chittagong, it could be now that he becomes too high a risk to carry.
A left-of-centre option is trusting Peter Handscomb to take over. With ample experience at first class level, he said after the Darwin practice match ahead of this tour he would be available to keep if the circumstances and team balance permitted. Maybe now they do.
Smith was forthright in acknowledging the options available for the second Test, and this is one. Especially if trying to find room for Hilton Cartwright, the West Australian who earned his baggy green in January before completing a bumper 2016-17 domestic season.
The other two alternatives for culling, for different reasons, seem unpalatable. In Usman Khawajas case, despite a pair of calamitous dismissals and adding only two runs for his return to the team, the opportunity-cost of shattering his confidence through omission is too much when he will be a necessary member of the Ashes team. As for Glenn Maxwell, in both innings he looked well in control with solid starts until his disappointing final moments. But he does not look out of his depth, and that still matters plenty.
The puzzle is also shaped by the arrival of Steve OKeefe, in transit as the Test was decided. Smith said if the wicket suits he is comfortable playing three frontline spinners in Chittagong for the first time since Australia played at the same ground in 2006. After the mayhem local tweakers engineered this week, a dust bowl is a lock-in  and in turn OKeefe. What a week for the discard-cum-inclusion.
Following his emphatic man-of-the-match performance, Shakib Al Hasan put it bluntly: After this Test match, theyll show a lot more respect. The SOS for SOK signals a quick change of thinking from the team hierarchy, suggesting they concur. While there was no shame in losing the opener, theres no excuse not to do whatever it takes from here. Beginning at the selection table.

Sampanthan was discussing the issues with visiting US Assistant Secretary of State, Ambassador Alice Wells at the residence of the US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap.
Sampanthan apprised the Ambassador on the political situation in the country and the matters pertaining to the Constitution making process.

Gen. Jayasuriya involved in misdeeds:Field Marshal Fonseka
Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka yesterday, said that he was aware that former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya was allegedly involved in wrongdoings.
I was determined to take action against him after the war on terrorism was over, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka added.
Fonseka added that he received many complaints at that point that Jayasuriya had allegedly committed various offences.
If a proper mechanism was established to inquire into the alleged offences committed by Jayasuriya, I will provide my evidence against him, he said.
Fonseka added that he had informed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to avoid appointing Jagath Jayasuriya as the Commander of Army.
I have never admitted that he was capable of commanding the Sri Lanka Army after my tenure in the Army ended, he added.
Fonseka said that the former ruler singled out Jayasuriya as the next Commander of the Sri Lanka Army at a time when there were around 15 officers above him in terms of seniority.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Fonseka said that former Army Commander Jayasuriya was dancing to the whims and fancies of the former Defence Secretary. He led the Army to drag me into Prison, Fonseka said.
Fonseka further said that there were several divisions in the battle field and they were brought under his direct command.
The divisions in the battle field were not brought under Jayasuriya. He was the Vanni Security Forces Commander overseeing the front line bunker line in Vavuniya. He was only entrusted with providing logistic facilities to Army personnel in the battle field and evacuating of casualties. We are disappointed to hear the Sri Lanka Army being criticized at a time when it deserves accolades and proper recognition.
Many crimes had taken place at some places and they should be inquired into and those responsible, should be punished so that the dignity of the Sri Lanka Army could be protected.
If any person has committed an offence, he should be punished according to the law of the country, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said.
If all those who were involved in criminal activities were to be punished, the Sri Lanka Army would regain its lost dignity.

GMOA warns of continuous strikes over SAITM
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) along with the people's barricade against SAITM will launch island wide continuous strikes within the next two weeks if the government delays offering a solution to the SAITM issue, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that so far the government offered six different sets of proposals to solve the SAITM issue and all of them had been formulated in order to save the fraudulent institution and not to ensure the safety and well-being of the people. This action by the relevant authorities should be completely changed in order to solve the issue in a people friendly manner.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA has already revealed to the country about the persons who are intentionally preventing solving the issue. They prevent the President and Prime Minister from solving the issue. The statement made by the President on SAITM during media heads' meeting held recently is highly questionable. Nobody knows why the Government does not consider the technical facts and solutions presented by the Deans of state Medical faculties.
Six hundred days have passed since the medical students started a fast and over 7,000 medical students missed lectures for eight months by now. Doctors passed out from SLMC approved foreign medical faculties are waiting to sit for the Act 16 Examination. SAITM students are trapped inside SAITM for eight years. Granting intern appointments will be delayed for a long time and there will be no new doctors for the country, he added.

Hotline 3636 to help mothers in labour
A hotline (3636) was launched recently to save the lives of labouring mothers in critical condition with various complications and their infants.
The hotline is open all 24 hours for all Junior Consultants, the doctors from peripheral hospitals and the Consultant Community Physician, Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka (PSSL) former President Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
According to Dr. Jayaratne, the hotline is a voice operating system that directs the doctors to obtain the service.
The hotline offers expert medical advice from a team of Expert Consultants for junior consultants and doctors from peripheral hospitals to manage obstetric, neonatology or public health emergency patient or situations.
The hotline also offers to take over the patient by asking doctors to transfer the patient to a bigger hospital.
Dr. Jayaratne said if doctors use Mobitel connections, they can dial 3636. If they use other service providers connections, they can dial 0710363636. The service is available countrywide. Any doctor who is handling a delivering mother in a critical condition can obtain either advice or the opportunity to transfer the patient to a hospital where expert care is available. Pregnant mothers and infants face serious conditions due to the lack of senior support, inadequate facilities or without transfer options. The service will save many lives of mothers and infants. It will cut down the maternal death rate of the country, Dr. Jayaratne said.
The Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka initiated the establishment of a support group of experts from three specialities (pediatrics, obstetrics, community medicine) to help peripheral level clinicians or junior colleagues to provide expert advice or to take over the serious cases.

Lunch packet price increased by Rs.10
The price of a lunch packet will be increased by Rs.10 from today as a token of protest against the ban on lunch sheets, Sri Lanka Canteen Owners Association President Asela Sampath said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the average price of a rice packet is Rs 120, adding that this would be raised to Rs 130. He said the Association would meet today and decide on price revision of other food items such as string hoppers, kottu, fried rice, pittu etc as they are also usually wrapped in lunch sheets.
The food sellers are seriously affected due to the new ban on polythene and lunch sheets. The take away concept became successful because of lunch sheets. There is no proper alternative for lunch sheets. There is no fixed price for other alternative products, and the importers of such products try to sell them at Rs 6-8 to us. The price of a lunch sheet is Rs 1.70. If lunch sheets are not used, food sellers water bill will rise sharply as all the plates must be washed, he complained.
Insisting that the Government should do away with the new ban on polythene, he said they would help the Government with segregation of waste and recycling.

Im playing after 19 months following a leg injury. In the Zimbabwe and India series I couldnt play well. Ill see where Im at after this series, and evaluate how long I can play given the way my body is, said the 34-year-old Malinga.
No matter how experienced I am  if I cant win a match for the team and do what the team needs, theres no point in me being here. Ill see if I can make up for that 19 months and regain that form over the next three or four months.
Ill see the number of games that I get. If not Ill have to consider the state of my body, and what is expected of me. If I cant deliver that, then Ill happily retire, he said. In the fourth ODI against India on Thursday, Malinga playing in his 203rd match became only the fourth Sri Lankan bowler to capture 300 wickets when he dismissed Indian captain Virat Kohli.
It was only the second wicket Malinga had taken in the current ODI series and his two wickets have come at a cost of 104 runs apiece. In the series against Zimbabwe, Malinga took four wickets in five matches at 50.25.
Since his return to fifty-over cricket in the Champions Trophy he has taken 9 wickets in 12 matches at a cost of 65.33.
However at the pre-match press conference Malinga stated that he would like to play until the 2023 World Cup when he will be 40, but it seems that he has evaluated his performances since then.

McIlroy chomping at the bit to defend Boston title
Norton: Reigning FedExCup champion Rory McIlroy believes his strong record at Boston will prove invaluable as he seeks to defend his Dell Technologies Championship crown Friday on the second leg of the PGA Tour playoffs.
The battle for golf supremacy is down to the top 100 golfers and McIlroy is up for the challenge at the par-71, 7,342-yard course located about 40 kilometres (25 miles) southwest of Boston, Massachusetts.
"I'm a big believer that it is a little bit horses for courses like you hear, and Boston is definitely a track that sets up well for me," McIlroy said.
"I've been lucky enough to win at a couple of courses multiple times in my PGA Tour career, and I think just mentally you're just a lot more comfortable.
"You've hit great shots on that golf course before, you've shot low scores, and you've seen birdies out there.
"That's the thing -- once you know you can make birdies on a golf course, it makes it easier to do that again."
Do it again indeed. The Northern Irishman won at this course in 2016 and 2012, joining Fijian-Indian Vijay Singh as the only golfers to win this event more than once. Singh won in 2008 and 2004.
World number one Dustin Johnson moved to the top of the playoff standings with a win last week over Texan Jordan Spieth.
"Winning last week is big, because I'm probably guaranteed to be in the top five going into Atlanta, which is where you want to be," Johnson said. "Because you win the tournament, you win the FedExCup championship and that's the biggest thing for me."
The top 70 players on the playoff points list after this event advance to the BMW Championship, set for September 14-17 at Conway Farms Golf Club in Illinois.
Then the top 30 players following the BMW Championship will qualify for the Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, beginning September 21. A points reset will take place prior to the Tour Championship, giving all players in the field a mathematical opportunity to win the Tour title.
As Johnson alluded to, the top-five players control their own destiny and would claim the playoff bragging rights with a victory at East Lake.

Former Finance Minister MP Ravi Karunanayake yesterday said they would defeat the No-confidence Motion (NCM) against Minister Rajitha Senaratne by a two-thirds if it was presented in Parliament.
MP Karunanayake was participating in a ceremony to hand over a clean drinking water supply project to Anuradhapura yesterday (31).
MP Karunnayake said it was important to note that the Joint Opposition was bringing the No-confidence Motion against a minister who brought down drugs and medical equipment prices.
When we are making a change in the country, some parties cannot stand it. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes creative development plan has expedited our economic growth. Some who cannot stand the rapid development process try to hinder it many ways, MP Karunanayake said.
MP Karunanayake said their dedication was towards the country and for the good governance for which he gave up his post.
Who is bringing this motion of no confidence One MP is someone who paid Rs. 500 million for his divorce case. Another has two passports. No-confidence Motions have turn into a joke now, he said.
The drinking water supply project was halted for many years and MP Karunanayake restored it by providing special provisions. Over 100 families in Nelumkanniya, Sattakulama and Halmillewa will benefit from the project.

New lease for Unity Govt.
President Maithripala Sirisena has laid it down in black and white. The Unity Government comprising the UNP and SLFP will run its full course until 2020.The MOU signed between the two parties will come up for renewal in December. But he was confident the union will continue, the President told newspaper editors, media heads and publishers at a breakfast meeting on Wednesday.
The President also said he would run the government until 2020 irrespective who leaves it or who comes in. He said, for the first time in the country's post independence history, the two major parties, who were at each other's throats, have come together to serve the people. He was certain that the arrangement will last despite some hiccups on the way.
Of course there is no alternative but for the two main protagonists to coalesce. No party had received a majority in parliament and only chaos can ensue in the absence of a working arrangement. It should also be recalled that a Unity Government was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesignhe's brainchild, for both parties to be equal stakeholders in the government, when, as the leader of the party with the largest majority in parliament, he could have easily engineered some crossovers.
Certainly, there is no reason for the UNP and SLFP to be daggers drawn any more. The SLFP, as a party, had long ago shed its socialist ideology and protectionist economy policies. The party has CBK to thank for that. She not only divested the SLFP from it's inward looking approach and socialist hangovers, but also bettered the greens in her zeal to continue with the market economy, famously saying she, who was once good socialist, will now be a good capitalist. Not only that, she completely rolled back her mother's protectionist agenda and even invited the Shell Company to whom Mrs. B showed the door, back into the country, with no qualms whatsoever.
Hence, the SLFP, at present, will have no trouble in adapting itself to the new reality and meld with the UNP in its thinking and outlook. Vituperative and contentious politics had taken this country nowhere except backwards. Hence, it is incumbent on both parties to set aside all petty differences and work for the common good of the country. Those who want to leave the alliance, as the President said, are welcome to do so. There has been speculation that some ministers in the SLFP are on the verge of quitting the government. Some of their recent remarks, no doubt, are indicative of where their sympathies lay. But they will be making a big political miscalculation if they harbour the thought that the SLFP voters are still with them. Having consorted with the enemy, they are bound to be regarded with scorn and contempt. With the general election a full three years away, those planning to quit will have to remain in the wilderness for that long, either with the Joint Opposition or as Independents, shorn off all ministerial perks. And like the President hinted, commenting on the attempts to divide the SLFP, those being cast adrift from the party would soon find out that they are orphaned. He recalled the fissures experienced by both the UNP and the SLFP at some point of time in their journeys, observing that the ultimate refuge (for all renegades) lay in the original party, be it the SLFP or UNP, in a clear dig at the Joint Opposition.
The President, no doubt, had precedents to go by. UNP and SLFP stalwarts who left their parties to set up splinter groups invariably returned back to the fold. Neither of these splinter groups succeeded on their own, as the results of the by- elections that followed the parting showed. Only Vijaya Kumaratunga managed to push the SLFP into third place at the Minneriya by-election in 1985 contesting from his breakaway Sri Lanka Mahajana Party, which, though, was decimated in the other three by elections held at the same time.
Mahinda Rajapaksa, may, or, may not, be as popular as Vijaya but only his hardcore supporters will vote for him at a future election if he contests from outside the SLFP, while the rest of the JO caboodle will be consigned to the status of also rans.
The President said; only the SLFP has a vision and a policy framework. The party is guided by them. Political parties with individual agendas cannot function in the long run.
It is time that those from the SLFP faction of the Unity Government who are planning to align with the JO ponder the fate that is in store for them before falling into the pile of also rans. The Yahapalanaya administration may have erred in some ways. But it is doubtful if the public are yearning for a return of Rajapaksa rule which they ended only two and a half years ago. With the Unity Government now set to continue its full term, it is hoped that the President and the Government will fulfill all the promises made to the people.

No military alliances, foreign bases here - PM
ONLY joint exercises with friendly countries:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed that the country will not enter into military alliances with any country or make the countrys bases available to foreign countries.
Speaking at the inauguration of second Indian Ocean conference at Temple Trees on Thursday, the Prime Minister reiterated that the government headed by President Maithripala Sirisena will continue military cooperation such as training, supply of equipment and taking part in joint exercises with friendly countries.
The premier refuted claims by some segments that the Hambantota Port would be turned into a military base. He said that only Sri Lankan Armed Forces are allowed to carry out military activities in ports and airports.
Only the Sri Lanka Armed Forces have the responsibility for military activities in our ports and airports, the premier added.He said that the government is working with foreign private investors on the commercial development of sea ports.
The Prime Minister added that freedom of navigation is of paramount importance for Sri Lanka to become the Hub in the Indian Ocean.
It is only then that we can reap the full benefits of our strategic location as well as the availability of ports on all coasts and two international airports with good land connectivity.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also urged all countries to concentrate on a Blue Economy and have IORA coordinate efforts from all countries to address overfishing, pollution and habitat losses.
Coming back to security, the Prime Minister reiterated his call for the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean and there be unhindered lawful maritime commerce according to international standards.
Major world powers have deployed substantial military power in the Indian ocean.Vital sea lanes of communication should be open for all and must be used for mutual benefit in a sustainable manner, he said.
As he touched on the maritime build up of major players such as India, Australia,China,USA and Japan from ocean and the latter three increasing their forward naval presence,Wickremesinghe warned of the need to watch out for naval competition among these major powers.

Patana residents protest against garbage dumping
Residents of Patana town and its suburbs staged a picketing near the Patana Isipatanaramaya Buddhist temple on Thursday, against the dumping of garbage at Patana.
The residents said garbage causes flies and dengue mosquitoes to spread.
The Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha built a garbage recycling plant in the Patana Colony close to Patana town and started dumping garbage collected from Kotagala, Patana and Bogahawatte bazaar.
Tons of garbage collected from the Hatton-Dickoya Urban Council are also being diverted to Patana daily, making the Patana village a breeding ground for flies and dengue mosquitoes. The flies and mosquitoes have stormed into houses, hotels and shops at Patana.

Polythene ban comes into effect
The importation, manufacturing and wholesale trade of shopping bags and lunch sheets was strictly banned islandwide from yesterday, Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Deputy Director General Upali Indraratne said.
Speaking to Daily News, Indraratne however clarified that the CEA does not intend to take stringent action at this point on ordinary people who use the banned polythene items.
First we will fully concentrate on prohibiting the imports, manufacturing and distribution of those items. The available stocks will gradually phase out by another month or two. Then we will gradually start raids. There are provisions to impose a jail sentence of not more than two years and a fine not exceeding Rs 10,000 to an offender who contravenes this environmental law, he said.
Indrarante stressed the polythene manufacturers are legally bound to stop manufacturing all the banned polythene and plastic items from yesterday, adding that the environmental law would be fully implemented against the offenders. We have about 500 regional officers working in our 25 district offices. They will monitor the manufacturing plants and distribution aims in their respective areas, he added.
Asked about replacements available in the market for shopping bags, Indraratne observed it would not be an issue at all, adding that ample other Eco-friendly products such as paper bags, reusable cloth bags, canvass bags, mesh bags, etc are there to take the place of shopping bags. Replacements for lunch sheets are limited, but a bio-degradable sheet is available in the market. The price of a lunch sheet is Rs 1.70 where as the price of this bio-degradable sheet is Rs 4-4.50. However, the prices may come down when the demand increases, Indraratne pointed out.
Indraratne, while accepting that it is not practical to enforce this law over night, however stressed there is no need whatsoever to reverse this important national decision.

President pledges cooperation with India, other countries
Closing the second annual Indian Ocean conference Friday evening, President Maithripala Sirisena said Sri Lanka would work to promote peace and prosperity in the region.
We appreciate peace between our countries, we appreciate peace between every ethnic group, he said in a speech at Temple Trees.
But Sirisena said that drug and human traffickers, pirates, and international terrorists threatened the stability of the region.
From its place at the center of the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka would work to promote peace, reconciliation, and brotherhood, he said. We can be useful for sharing knowledge, global trade, and working towards the progress of humankind.
Speaking just before President Sirisena, General V.P. Malik, a former chief of staff of the Indian army, said the gathering will promote lasting relationships for the future.
To my mind, everyone I noticed wanted more of globalization, and less of protectionism or domination, he said. This is indeed quite different to what we see in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe defended the governments recent decision to lease a majority stake of the Hambantota Port to China Merchants Port Holdings, a state-run company, which reportedly concerned some in New Delhi.
He said that because there is no multilateral trade agreement in the Indian Ocean region, Sri Lanka had to enter bilateral agreements with individual states.
Additionally, I state clearly that Sri Lankas government, headed by President Maithripala Sirisena, does not enter into military alliances with any country or make our bases available to foreign countries, he said.
The conference, which is organized by the India Foundation, closed on Friday night, after playing the national anthems of Sri Lanka and India.

President proposed Chamals name for PM candidate at last General Election: SB
President Maithripala Sirisena proposed that Chamal Rajapaksa be chosen as the Prime Ministerial candidate at the last General Election and if the former President and the SLFP supporters had agreed to this compromise, we would have been able to win 120 seats to form a SLFP government, Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage Minister and SLFP Treasurer, S.B. Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake addressing a media briefing held at the SLFP Party Headquarters at Darley Road yesterday traced the critical mistakes in the history of the Party as it gears up to celebrate its 66th Convention on September 3.
When the General Election came, the President wanted to keep Mahinda Rajapaksa; who had lost the election aside and choose from his own family, a person who didnt have allegations of corruption, to make as the SLFP Prime Ministerial candidate under his leadership. The UNP could field their candidate, Minister Dissanayake said.
Mahinda Rajapaksa agreed to it at first but then later wanted to manage the elections. The defeat at the Presidential election, he saw as a conspiracy and that it was impossible for him to lose. He thought that there was a Mahinda Tsunami in the peoples hearts and he wanted to return. But as party seniors we thought otherwise. We pointed out to him that the Muslim vote which stood at 15 percent had dropped to 2 percent, Catholic vote from 45 percent to 25 percent, the Tamil vote from 30 to 15 percent and our own youth votes had gone to the Swan and people who had only voted for SLFP, voting for the Swan. At that time, the President didnt want the party to break so he withdrew from the election fight and during that election, we face a bad defeat. Our 5.8 million vote base was reduced to 4.7 million. We saw the people keep away from the President and his supporters and vote for those of Mahinda Rajapaksa, explained Dissanayake. The President, he said further had done much to protect the SLFP and its supporters,though we did all we could to defeat him at the 2015 Presidential election. Dissanayake who was appointed as the SLFP Treasurer in 2015 said the UNP had pushed for General Elections soon after the Presidential elections but it was the President who postponed it and prevented a historical defeat for the party at the General.
At the same time, many SLFPers were victimised soon after the Presidential elections and not allowed to come to work, etc but the President resolved all those grievances, he added.
Despite the losses however, Dissanayake pointed out that the SLFPs incumbent has built up the party faster than during previous occasions when the party had faced similar splits.
The 64th Convention we held in Polonnaruwa with the attendance of Mahinda Rajapaksa, and the one in Kurunegala saw a bigger crowd. We believe that at Campbell Park this year, the turnout will be even greater than last year, he said.
The SLFP established in 1951, for those who opted for the middle ground between the bourgeoisie UNP and the Communist LSSP, has Dissanayake said established strong foundations which help built the countrys hoeme grown economy.
Dissanayake believes that the country would have been much better developed today if the UNP in 1978 had followed at least some of its(SLFP) policies.
The SLFP today, too believed that enterprise should not be completely privatised,said Dissanayake and added that the SLFP faction in government will go into the 66th Convention with the economic vision that the government needs to have at least some control of state enterprises and that only management should be improved.
Coincidentally, this years Convention falls on the birthday of President Maithripala Sirisena, as the President himself turns 66. He is expected to make a special statement on the day.

Science, Technology & Research Minister Susil Premajayantha said Sri Lanka lacked innovations, but the situation would change in the near future.
He was addressing a media event on Thursday evening.
In our country, rarely can one see articles on innovations, he said in an interview.
He said the problem started in schools, with a lack of focus on science, technology, engineering, and math education.
When people later have product ideas, very little infrastructure support their work and connect them to investors, he said.
Instead, what we have to do is, promote our innovations, innovators, and match with entrepreneurs, he said. Premajayantha said his ministry along with the Sri Lanka Inventors Commission would establish an innovation incubator, modeled after centers in Houston, Shanghai, and Japan.
Innovators can come and use our lab equipment, our human resources, like engineers, and then they can use new technical know-how to market their products, he said.
He promised a noticeable change in Sri Lankan innovation in the next two years.

Shai Hope comes of age with historic double act
Shai Hope has aged a lot more than five days in this past week. He started this match a kid but finished it a man. He made his very first Test century on Saturday and followed it, three days later, with his second. There is little new left for anyone to do in this game but this was something that had never been done before.
In the 127 years they have been playing first-class cricket at Headingley, no one  not Len Hutton, not Herbert Sutcliffe, not Geoff Boycott  had scored two centuries in a first class match here. Then, in the twilight of on Tuesday night, Hope squirted the ball away square off the inside edge of his bat and sprinted a single for his 100th run. He did not stop long to celebrate; there was still a game to win. Forty minutes later he had done that, too. He finished 118 not out, the last of them the winning runs.
So this Test doubled as Hopes coming-of-age party at 23. His batting has been imperious, almost impeccable, his strokeplay dashing, his defence resolute. Last week West Indies new CEO said he was looking for players to build his team around for the next 10 years. Well, now he has found one. Or two, in fact, since Hope spent most of the day batting with Kraigg Brathwaite, just as he did on Saturday.
Brathwaite almost beat Hope to that Headingley record but was caught behind for 95, trying to drive Moeen Ali. He ended up on a different list, then, of batsmen who have made a hundred here and then got out in the nineties second time around. It is a lot longer than the one Hope is on. Not that Hope seemed too fussed by his feat. Yeah Hope said when told what he had done, Thanks for the news.
At one point the two of them seemed to be racing towards the record. Hope sped to his fifty, scoring so fast he almost overtook Brathwaite, who had been at the crease for 20 overs already. It came from 70 balls and included seven fine fours, glorious shots most of them, stunning back-foot cover drives, fine leg glances, delicate sweeps and swingeing pulls.
Then, when Brathwaite fell, Hope was savvy enough to realise that his role in the game had changed. He slowed right down again. He spent more than an hour on the 10 runs that took his score from 60 to 70. Altogether the second half of his century took him another 105 balls. And towards the end of the innings he was even trying to calm down Jermaine Blackwood, who seemed hellbent on trying to win the game in sixes.
Five days ago Hope was exactly that, a boy with plenty of potential. He has been in the team for two years and had a batting average of 18. He had made a single fifty in the 11 Tests he had played before this. He has had to learn on the job. But his attitude to it was one of the things that most impressed the old hands, who agreed he was worth persisting with. Hes always willing to learn, said Richie Richardson earlier this summer. If he got out a particular way, he would go into the nets and try to work on his weaknesses and I like that about him. Hes always willing to learn and always asking questions. Hes got a desire to work hard and to achieve great things.
Hope was a good schoolboy wicketkeeper-batsman in Barbados, though nothing like as prolific as Brathwaite, who had made 30-odd centuries by the time he was 14. Hopes game seemed to kick on when he won a scholarship to study in the sixth form at St Bedes College in Sussex in 2011, where he was coached by the old Sussex batsman Alan Wells. In the summer of 2012 he scored four centuries in seven innings for the Barbados under-19 team. He made himself a reputation as a stylish stroke-maker and in 2015 West Indies gave him a Test debut as a reward for his form in the first season of the new Professional CricketLeague. He was 21 and had played only a handful of first-class games for Barbados.
Since then Hope has looked a little like a kid in adult cricket, his wicket easy pickings for the old pros. Mitchell Johnson got him three times in four innings when West Indies played Australia, Yasir Shah four in six when they played Pakistan. That was until now.
There have been a few young West Indian batsmen whose careers drifted away after they made early centuries. Only a few years ago Adrian Barath took a hundred off Australia on his Test debut but he played only another 14 games. But Hope, one guesses, will go on to great things. Collar up, sleeves buttoned at the cuff, he is going to become a very familiar sight in the next decade. Hell, Englands bowlers will be sick of him already.

SLFP celebrates 66th anniversary
The SLFP which is eternally etched in the hearts of the self sufficient rural masses donning the cloth and banian, claims a proud history of 66 years.
There was an intellectual who probed the economic, social, cultural and political developments in this country during the middle and latter half of the 1940 decade. He was Queens Counsel H. Sri Nissanka who was a linguist and an eminent legal personality rich with Buddhist values. He was a colleague of late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who studied law at the Oxford University in England. During their university life, Nissanka used to brief Bandaranaike on Buddhist and Cultural values maintained in the country from time to time.
The two of them exchanged views in a friendly dialogue.Sri Nissanka who had a matured intelligence outstripping his age, made Bandaranaike shun his Western culture and habits and imbibe local cultural values and get accustomed to them.
On their return to Sri Lanka after their studies, both Bandaranaike and Sri Nissanka got involved in the legal and political section Sri Nissanka and Bandaranaike started a discussion at the Yamuna residence at Kirillapone to build the SLFP on the theme of social democracy. The end result was the formation of the SLFP in 1951 with the participation of more progressive individuals.
It was Sri Nissanka who proposed the party name as the Sri Lanka Freedom Party and its colour as Blue, symbol as the Hand and drew up its constitution. Nissanka who entrusted Bandaranaike with the responsibility of leading the party, cleared his path by acting as a theoretician.
The furniture including chairs and desks and the pen used at this inaugural ceremony of the party are still preserved at the Yamuna residence (presently called Yamuna Sadaham Ashramaya).
Spearheaded by the five fold forces. The Sangha, Native Physicians, Teachers, Farmers and Workers, the SLFP proliferated into rural areas with great public appeal, gaining the blessings of the rural masses. Turning a new leaf in the history of Sri Lankas politics Mr Bandaranaike was able to set up a new government in 1956 with the support of left parties.
Prime Minister Bandaranaike steered the country towards a revolutionary change by changing its Western oriented foreign policy into one friendly towards the Socialist Bloc led by China and Russia. At a time he was steering Sri Lanka towards development with new energy by launching nationalised services and receiving the unstinted support of the masses, he was gunned down and stilled by an assailant in 1956 marking the most tragic incident in the countrys history.
Although Wijayananda Dahanayake inherited the Premiership he was not able to maintain the party with the same energy. It was the same with later C.P de Silva. Late Sirimavo Bandaranaike was installed as the Leader of the Party on the invitation of all sections and she managed to take the party forward by protecting Bandaranaike policies and overcoming all challenges systematically. Late Bandaranaike rendered a great service as the Worlds First Woman Prime Minister. She conducted foreign policy with great aplomb and finesse. Facing various threats and challenges she managed to protect the party even better than her own children.
The strategies adopted by her quelled the 1971 youth uprising earned plaudits from friend and foe alike. The SLFP which had been trodding a difficult path after overcoming various crises which erupted from time to time is today endeavouring to endear itself to the rural masses by protecting ourness.
Today we are passing a period where democracy is overflowing in the party ensuring great freedom within it. It is most praiseworthy to see incumbent SLFP Chairman President Maithripala Sirisena acting with great patience and steer it with greater energy. Entrusting party responsibilities to youth he has launched a training facility to provide them with political education.
At this important juncture it is the duty of grateful party members and supporters to spare a thought and remember Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who ended a 30 year war and former President and Party Chairperson Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who laid the foundation towards gaining minority support and votes to the party by promoting communal unity and harmony.
As the SLFP celebrates its 66th anniversary on September 3, it is memorable and most significant to see President Maithripala Sirisena donning the party leadership with the support and representation of this five fold forces and the leadership of the country.
Long live the SLFP which celebrates its 66th anniversary.

SLFP hands over proposals
Constitutional reforms:
Steering Committee awaiting proposals to finalise interim report:
Report deals with vital aspects of the Constitution:
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) submitted its Constitutional reforms to the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly on Thursday, Parliamentary sources told the Daily News.
The Steering Committee was awaiting the SLFP proposals to finalise its interim report, which will pronounce the contours of Constitutional reforms. The report, which deals with vital aspects of the Constitution including electoral reforms, devolution of power and nature of the State is expected in the Constitutional Assembly this month.
Steering Committee sources confirming that it received the SLFP proposals from Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said those would be put before the committee at its next round of meeting scheduled from September 6.
The Steering Committee has been ready with the interim report since December last year, but its presentation delayed because the SLFP was bidding more time to articulate its position on constitutional reforms.
Ministers Nimal Siripala, Dilan Perera and Susil Premajayantha are representing the SLFP at the Steering Committee headed by the Prime Minister. Many SLFP stalwarts over the past months insisted that the Executive Presidency should not be abolished and that they were not in favour of any Amendment that requires a referendum.
The SLFP proposals will be important in reaching common ground as to whether there will be a new Constitution or only an Amendment.

Sri Lanka fails to seal direct qualification
ICC Cricket World Cup 2019:
Sri Lanka has been unable to seal a direct qualification place in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 in the ongoing ODI series against India after failing to win two matches.
The 1996 World champions needed two wins in the five-match series to secure a place in the ICCs pinnacle 50-over event, which will take place from 30 May to 15 July in the United Kingdom. The top seven ODI sides apart from host England as on 30 September qualify directly.
But with India taking a 4-0 lead, Sri Lanka will now have to wait for the Windies to lose at least one of its upcoming matches to be able to clinch that berth. If Sri Lanka wins the last match of the series on Sunday, it will reach 88 points on the points table but that will not be enough to ensure it automatic qualification.
The Windies will be able to overtake Sri Lanka in such a scenario since it can also reach 88 points and edge Sri Lanka on decimal points if it wins its upcoming six matches  one against Ireland on 13 September and all ODIs of a five-match series against England from 19 to 29 September.
In case Sri Lanka loses the series 5-0, the Windies will be able to overtake it by beating Ireland and winning either all five matches against England or the last four matches for a 4-1 series win.
Teams not getting direct places in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 will get another shot through a Qualifying tournament. The ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier 2018 will feature the bottom four sides from the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Team Rankings, the top four sides from the ICC World Cricket League Championship and the top two sides from the ICC World Cricket League. The top two sides from the World Cup Qualifier will complete the 10-team line-up for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019.

Sri Lanka to produce drug requirement within the country
Sri Lanka expects to produce 100 percent of its drug requirement within the country by 2020, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, 85 percent of the country's drug requirement will be produced within the country by 2019. A total of 38 companies have already signed agreements with the State Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) to produce drugs in Sri Lanka. He was addressing the gathering after opening the second drug (antibiotic injection vials) manufacturing company in Sri Lanka at Horana recently.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that the drugs produced jointly will be purchased by the Government for a period of 15 years and the drugs produced independently will be purchased by the Government for a period of 10 years. The first drug manufacturing company opened in Kandy and this second company produces injections.
The additional drug production of the country will be exported. The project will save a lot of money for the country.
The new company is a good example against the accusations made by the opposition stating that this Government does not carry out development work. The Government has offered the the people an opportunity to live freely even while criticizing the Government. Some people see this `Maithree Governance' as something wrong, this idea will change soon. The President and Prime Minister will create a `Maithree Governance', he added. Navesta Pharmaceuticals has invested Rs. 1.4 billion for the project under BOI approval. It has created around 100 direct employment and around 500 indirect employment opportunities. Annually it will supply around 50 million injection vials to the state health sector.

Sri Lanka struggle today because of lost generation of players  Malinga
The ongoing assumption that the lack of a proper domestic first-class tournament has been a main cause for the decline of the national cricket teams present predicament at international level took a new turn with legendary fast bowler Lasith Malinga blaming the plight on the loss of a generation of players.
Following Thursdays 168-run defeat in the fourth one-day international to India at the R Premadasa Stadium, Malinga stated, Im not sure if there is a problem at domestic cricket, but what I personally think is that our problems are because we lost a generation of players. If that generation was here, we wouldnt have an inexperienced team like this at international level.
We had players like Chamara Silva, Thilina Kandamby, Jehan Mubarak, Malinga Bandara, Kaushal Lokuarachchi, Kaushal Weeraratne, Tharanga Paranavitana and Malinda Warnapura. Those players played about 10 years of domestic cricket by the time they were 29 or 30, and played internationals for two or three years. Then they were out of the international scene. We lost that 10-12 years of experience from them, said Malinga.
Its really hard to get that experience from a fresh-out-of-school cricketer or a club cricketer. The loss of that generation is being felt in our cricket. If they had still been here  I dont know why we lost them  we would have had the ability to field 6 or 7 experienced players in the team.
When I started playing in 2004, there were 7 or 8 experienced players in the team. A few years ago we lost that. Now our cricket has declined. We are hoping to go to the World Cup and I hope that well be able to take the cricketers who are here now. We should all try to make that happen, he said,
Malinga called on the cricket authorities to have consistency in the selection of players and not to be swayed by public opinion expressed by various individuals.
In a year you might play 25 ODIs. And I havent seen a single player playing all 25 matches. Angelo, Thirimanne and me aside, most of the team has not played more than 30 ODIs, noted Malinga
When you look at other teams, you can think about how many of their players have played a lot of matches, and then you will see our shortcomings. If you take our 11 cricketers, how many ODIs have they played We are lacking in those experienced players.
Thats why when a difficult situation comes and were playing against a good team, we find it hard to come out of that. We need to give these guys a place and experience until 2019. We need to be patient. We need to get together as a country. If we keep criticising everyone one by one, we will keep getting these new teams. We have to protect the players we have, he said.
The current thinking is always The player who is in the team is bad, but the one outside deserves a place. As a player who has played 14 years international cricket, I think the people who are in the team are there because they are better than those outside.
Malinga stated that since the fifth ODI against Zimbabwe Sri Lanka has been unable to get past the 250-run mark and that was due to the lack of international experience from the players.
Since the last match of the Zimbabwe series, we couldnt be successful. In that match we only got about 200 and since then we havent been able to pass 250. I think, personally, if we are playing at international level, its when you get experience at international level that you understand how to handle difficult situations, said Malinga.
A lot of our players are inexperienced at international level, though they get their places because they perform at domestic level. If we gave some chances to the young players here, we will get players who can play for a long time. If we can give them experience to the team that goes to the 2019 World Cup, then you will have players who have played 30-50 ODIs.
In previous teams, you had players who had played 100 ODIs or at least 50 ODIs. We need that. Every other team in the world has that experience in their XI. We need to get there. We need to give the young players more matches and get them to the place we need them to be. Thats whats important, he said.
Malinga pointed out why Sri Lanka keeps failing to win matches is because the young players dont have the confidence to play their natural game.
They (the players) tried their best. I feel they dont have much confidence to play their natural game because the last couple of matches they lost and they didnt get much runs, they feel they have to score every single match.
Most of the players are young. They havent played much international cricket. They are excited to perform, and if you are excited you can do more mistakes. I feel thats the reason why our fielding is not good. It has been the situation in the last couple of months, he said.

STF will completely eliminate drug smuggling: Minister
Law and Order and Souther Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake yesterday said he had set a challenge to the Special Task Force (STF) to completely eliminate drug smuggling in Sri Lanka.
Minister Ratnayake said drug smuggling negatively complements the spread of underworld activities and terrorism.
Minister Ratnayake said the STF was the chief power countering the issue.
The Minister said a new division was formed headed by Senior DIG M.R. Latheef, combining the Organized Crime Division and Police Narcotic Bureau as a part of the challenge.
He said no party would be able to influence the new division. It is solely responsible to counter drug abuse and underworld activities, he said.
Minister Ratnayake was participating in the 33rd commemoration ceremony of the STF War Heroes held at the Katukurunda Training College yesterday.
The Minister said the STF would eliminate the drug issue, just as it contributed exceptionally to the war against terrorism.

Surrey skipper Batty glad no harm done by deadly arrow attack
London: Surrey captain Gareth Batty voiced his relief after no one was injured following a bizarre attack by a deadly arrow that saw a match against Middlesex abandoned at The Oval and the ground evacuated on Thursday .
The arrow, reported to have a metal tip, landed near the Surrey fielder Ollie Pope and close to the pitch during the County Championship fixture.
The players alerted the umpires, who promptly halted play, with fielders and batsmen running to the safety of the changing rooms before a crowd of more than 1,000 spectators was advised to take cover.
Police evacuated the ground, with the umpires eventually abandoning the First Division fixture, which was deep into the final day of four, as a draw.
No one was injured and, according to a statement issued by the Metropolitan Police, it is believed the arrow was fired from outside The Oval in Kennington, south London.
Batty, who was fielding some 25 yards from where the bolt landed, said: It was a pretty tasty arrow with a proper metal end.
I did archery as a kid and that was not a normal archery arrow.
The umpires dealt with it very well. There were no questions asked -- we went off very quickly.
Someone saw it in flight, there was a noise when it landed but it happened so quick. It is a deadly weapon for sure, if it had hit someone it would have caused some serious damage. It just shows the world we live in.
- Ashamed -
The former England off-spinner added: If it is a crossbow rather than a longbow it is probably someone messing around and not understanding the implications of firing something into the air.
Lets hope its a couple of people who will feel pretty ashamed in the morning when they realise what happened. There have been several high-profile terror incidents in Britain in recent months, including one at London Bridge -- just a couple of miles from The Oval -- on June 3 which killed eight members of the public and saw the three attackers shot dead by police. But a statement issued by Londons Metropolitan Police Force, said the arrow attack was not being treated as terrorism-related at this stage.
Police were made aware at 16:35hrs (1535 GMT) on Thursday, 31 August of reports that an arrow or crossbow bolt had been loosed into The Oval cricket ground, said Scotland Yard.
At this early stage it is believed that the object came from outside of the ground.
There have been no arrests. We retain an open mind as to motive. Enquiries continue. Pictures soon emerged on social media of Paul Baldwin, one of the match umpires, holding the pink-coloured bolt.
Surrey chief executive Richard Gould said the club had ensured all spectators were moved to a position of safety after the umpires took immediate action in suspending play.
We dont know whether this projectile was placed deliberately or whether it was simply fired by somebody from a distance and we just happened to be the landing spot, so we dont even know necessarily that it was done on purpose, Gould also told BBC Radio London.
The match was stopped after the first ball of the 69th over with Middlesex 214 for seven in their second innings. John Simpson was 88 not out and former England batsman Nick Compton unbeaten on 28.

Thomas, Sangakkara guide Tallawahs to win
Man of the Match Oshane Thomas whose searing pace dismantled St Kitts & Nevis Patriots chase and Kumar Sangakkara guided a spirited Jamaica Tallawahs to a 41-run win in the Caribbean Premier League match played at Kingston, Jamaica.
Sangakkara kickstarted the innings in the fifth over against Ben Hilfenhaus, riding a pair of streaky shots that fell safely as he carted the Australian for three fours and two sixes in a 24-run over. He routinely used his feet to combat the Patriots spin trio of Mohammad Hafeez, Mohammad Nabi and Tabraiz Shamsi. When he wasnt charging forward, he got creative within the crease, shuffling back and across to disrupt their lines with a series of flicks and scoops. By the end of his innings, hed racked up his third consecutive half-century.
Scores: Jamaica Tallawahs 157-5 in 20 overs (G Phillips 31, K Sangakkara 69, R Powell 43, S Cottrell 2/38)
St Kitts & Nevis Patriots 116 in 17.5 overs (E Lewis 40, Mohammad Hafeez 21, O Thomas 3/31, K Santokie 3/10, Mohammad Sami 2/10)

UNP led by example
UNP General Secretary and Minister of Public Enterprise Development, Kabir Hashim faces a delicate balance between working in a unity government while also ensuring that Party remains strong to face an inevitable election. In an interview with Daily News, Hashim stressed that the UNP has taken bold decisions to fight allegations of corruption within its own fold and will ensure that the UNP will serve the full term of the government, even in the likelihood that the SLFP chooses to withdraw from the national government.
Excerpts follow:
Q: Given that the SLFP-UNP agreement came to an end recently, there have been questions of whether the SLFP and the UNP can keep the partnership going until 2020, and given the various differences that have cropped recently, it seems doubtful. How confident are you that the two parties can stay together until 2020
A: When the elections were over in 2015, we signed an agreement and it was signed mainly for the purpose of a national agenda. We spoke of a national agenda because since independence, this country has had many national issues which remained unresolved. This is because of the two party system which changes every five years. The UNP had 107 seats, we could have formed our own government by getting some people together; at the time we had over 15 members willing to join us. But the Prime Minister had agreed with the President that they would work on a national agenda and that we would have a national government. So we put the country before party and signed an agreement.
The UNP stands by its commitment to go through the five years with the SLFP. We have shared Cabinet positions and many other positions. But now since the agreement has lapsed, it is up to the UNP and SLFP to decide on revalidating the agreement. In our hearts, it is a question of trust and we are ready to go ahead, however difficult it is. For the UNPers it is a matter of sacrifice because we are sharing power. We have been in opposition for the last 20 years, so many UNPers would have preferred to have power to ourselves but we are willing to share. But in the event the SLFP does not want to go ahead with the agreement, we have a mandate for five years, we will think of a way to work with other forces to continue the government. That is our first responsibility and we are confident that the government will continue until 2020 whether the agreement is revalidated or not.
Q: How do you think it is faring for the UNP so far In the last month alone you have had one UNP minister resign and another sacked It does not look good for the UNP within Cabinet
A: On the contrary, I think it is looking very good because the UNP took hard decisions. The UNP led by example. We spoke about a clean government, transparency and accountability. And there were only allegations made against Ravi Karunanayake, he was only a witness in the case, not even the accused. No charges against him. And despite that there was a political witch-hunt and it was a major political issue, so the party spoke to him and he agreed to step down until which time he is cleared. Which era did this ever happen Not only in Sri Lanka but in the whole of South Asia, was there a Minister who stepped down and paved way for a transparent investigation This is what the people have to remember, the UNP took that hard decision. And as far as Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe is concerned, we stand by collective responsibility and that shows that the UNP will not even spare the most powerful of persons if they dont stand by collective responsibility within Cabinet or within the party. They will have no mercy from the party because the party will be strict in its discipline and conduct. So we did very well in those two instances.
I would thus in return re-ask the question, in 2015, just before the election, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he apologizes because 'some of my guys were corrupt and that I should have taken action'. He himself said that in the newspapers. So he is admitting that some or most of his ministers were rogues. The same way, Mahinda Amaraweera, the present General Secretary of the UPFA, made a statement in 2014, on the eve of the elections, saying, 'why are you asking for a change You are saying we are corrupt, but why do you want to appoint new ones will do the same. So let the old rogues be there. He admitted that they have robbed. Two responsible people in their party have said this. Did one person step down Or be held accountable even when they went into opposition Some of have now come into government but did their party decide to clean up any of them So between the two, we are the party which has had the courage to listen to the people and where mistakes have been made, the UNP is willing to correct them.
Q: So are you saying that of the two parties, you now have the moral high ground because you have taken action against those who are allegedly corrupt
A: Not action but we have taken steps to pave the way for accountability and transparency. Since there have been accusations and counter accusations, we have asked a senior minister in our government to step down until investigations are complete. This is an unprecedented move.
Q: Speaking of the corrupt, in 2015 the UNP also promised to apprehend the corrupt and bring in clean government but since then, even backbenchers in your own party complain that little action has been taken with regard to that and they cannot face their own electorates. So do you believe that adequate action has been taken to deliver on the 2015 promises
A: With regard to corruption, there is a lot of discontent in the country that the government has not taken steps and the UNP feels that we havent taken any hard steps against those who were corrupt in the previous government. It's actually in the reverse, where our own members who have not even been proven with guilt have been dealt with. But there is one thing we are grappling with; it is the question of the law of the jungle. Earlier it was such and the former Commander of the Army was dragged into prison like an animal, there was no legal basis on which they took him, no procedures followed. Are people asking us to do the same thing We cannot do that, we have a legal process. So we allow the Police, Law and Order Ministry and Justice Ministry to follow the process but we do admit that there are bureaucratic delays. There are also allegations that there is influencing by some powerful people, there is even allegations that top officials are being bribed to stop investigations, the previous government has made so much money, that they are bribing officials. That is how the story goes, it might be true. That is why the last Cabinet meeting decided that there should be a special process to expedite these cases of rampant corruption, murder, etcthus the suggestion to set up special High Courts to speed up this process. And there would be a special team to follow this up, but we will not go outside of the legal structure for whatever reason.
Q: But the President himself has pointed out that the two UNP Ministries of Law and Order and Justice have been slower than usual to act
A: The President of course always has the recourse to set up of a separate unit, like that of the Bond Commission to speed it up. So instead of blaming each other, if there is any doubt that the UNP is not doing it, the President has access to doing it in an alternative way. But from our side, what we like to point out is that even if you take Nawaz Shariff, he was Prime Minister for two years before he was removed two years later. It takes time. The UNP is not willing to do witch-hunts on anybody but we also will not allow anyone to influence the Justice system and influence the course of justice. Now we are going to get tougher for sure.
Q: The 20th Amendment which has been promoted at a national level is now being increasingly rejected by the Provincial Councils. Do you think there is a gap between what national politicians want and what the Provincial Councillors are prepared to accept and take to their electorates
A: I would say that it is a lack of understanding and lack of communication that has led to some of the Provincial Councils not taking up the vote or voting against it. It was a joint decision by the two parties, within Cabinet and outside of it. So it was very clear within the two main parties that the election should be held in one day and not spread out. Therefore we need to work out a particular system. If there is more communication with the Provincial Council members, it should get sorted out. I do admit that there hasnt been enough communication between the two groups.
Q: But if the Provincial Councils keep rejecting it, would the government go ahead with it
A: The Government is definitely going to engage with the Provincial Councils and discuss it with them and if there is an issue, we will look at other legal recourses.
Q: There are allegations that the 20th Amendment is a farce to postpone elections and the people are asking for elections, even Local Government elections have not been held yet
A: As the General Secretary of the UNP, I want an election more than anyone else. I wanted an election on the day we won the General Election; to have the Local Government Elections one month after and to then immediately go for Provincial Councils. The UNP has always wanted elections and I too think that we should have elections, people want it and we have to give it to them ASAP.
Q: As we talk of elections, it seems that much of governance at present is being carried out under a cloud of election fears and promises. Many decisions are blamed to be motivated by a possible election or that many hard decisions not taken because of it
A: All the hard decisions are being made. We are bringing in the Inland Revenue Bill and we brought the Exchange Control Bill. Hard economic decisions are being made by the Government and mainly led by the UNP. We are not going to play populist politics but at the same time we are not outright stupid. We are also looking after people. We have promised the people we will look after them as much as policy decisions. On a daily basis, when we give people jobs, welfare benefits and houses; it is part of the UNP. If you go back to the 1977 era, JR Jayewardena started giving free books, free meals and free uniforms to children, Premadasa gave Janasaviya. That is how the UNP works and people should be happy about it and election or no election; I look at it as a good thing.
Q: So you think the grassroots UNPer is satisfied with the government and if you do go for an election end of the year, it would be a positive outcome for the party
A: To be satisfied you would have to attain Nirvana and no one has done that here. So people will always want more. That is why we are trying to grow the economy and give them more. But the people understand the current scenario the Government is working in. That we took on an economy with an unprecedented debt burden and that the highest debt repayments are coming up this year onwards with it increasing after that. People understand that we have a coalition government and we have to make decisions carefully, they understand that we dont have full power- we dont have Provincial and Local Governments. So people will give us time and strength to deliver better through those two institutions and then we can deliver better.
Q: Despite you saying people will understand, the Elections Commissioner recently pointed out that that there was a considerable drop in people registering to vote, especially the youth and that too mainly in the Greater Colombo area, a UNP stronghold. Does this not show that the people have lost faith in the system itself
A: That is a question that needs to be addressed and the youth are not usually patient as those who are older. There has been a very bad impression about politicians and politics in our country and that is due to a few cases and few people. People have generalized that all politicians are corrupt and not sincere. I dont agree with it, the majority of politicians are committed and have sacrificed their time and effort for the people. We need to change this perception by the action of good politicians. And yes this is a problem we need to grapple with. People are beginning to lose confidence in the system and politicians. That is why unconventional leaders have come up suddenly all over the world.
Q: What do you plan on doing about it
A: The few good men in Sri Lanka will have to start working a little bit harder.
Q: The UNP has also been criticized for not letting young blood come up. Though you talk of building a second generation of leaders, we dont necessarily see youth being given key positions There is a lot of discontent at the bottom
A: It is not only through position that you are recognized. When you are young, you need to make a mark on your own. The party gives you room to work and you get your positions when you keep becoming more mature and have more experience. You cannot take a young backbencher and make him a Minister or Deputy Minister- that is not how it works.
I sat in the last row of Parliament when I entered and I moved from there and it took me a long time. I was patient, I didnt have any positions, I was never in the Working Committee, Executive Committee or any senior positions but I worked hard and subsequently over the years, I became recognized and I automatically was given the position. That is how the UNP is building the young ones, we are not going to give them positions and say now prove how good you are. You prove how good you are and you will get your position.
Q: So basically, wait for it and you will get it
A: Not necessarily, you need to prove how good you are first. There are many young deputy ministers now. A lot of young MPs are now being groomed to be political leaders in their districts and outside. We have given them positions within the party; to lead different organisations such as youth, women, artists, non-governmental organisations, etc. they are engaging with different groups and learning. Recognition is not giving them a plump ministry or chairmanship. That is not how we do it in the UNP.
Q: That is not necessarily true, is it Your own leader was the youngest Cabinet minister in his time. Surely he did not wait as long as you to get it
A: As much as our leader was the youngest minister, he had to wait almost 40 years to become a strong Prime Minister, so it took him a long time and it was not an easy journey. Same way there are young deputy ministers who got that position just after 5 years in Parliament. They were lucky. I had to wait for 20 years. There are some other seniors who have waited for longer. It is a waiting game. And the UNP has recognized young people and given them work but we are in a sharing government and that is another challenge we have. We could have given more positions to young people but we have almost 35 SLFP Cabinet ministers and deputy ministers; that is a large number, so we had to deprive some of our own key members. There are senior, deserving members who could not be given ministries, so this is a tough time.

Water cut due to contamination fears
The Water Supply and Drainage Board yesterday shut down the water purification plant at Kandana, Horana as a precautinary measure for fear of contamination after a fuel bowser toppled at Kiriella on the PanaduraRatnapura Road.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board officials who visited the scene confirmed the possibility of fuel residue from the bowser draining into the Kalu Ganga which is just 750 metres away from the scene of the accident.
Water supply to Bandaragama, Horana, Boralesgamuwa, Moratuwa and Piliyandala was disrupted as a precautionary measure until officials confirmed that the water is not contaminated.
Water Board officials said that there is a possibility of water being contaminated as the accident had occurred on Thursday night and fuel coming out from the toppled bowser may have seeped into the Kalu Ganga due to heavy rains experienced in the area that night.
However, another bowser was brought to the site to remove petrol from the toppled bowser yesterday morning. Traffic on the Panadura Ratnapura road came to a halt for a few hours due to this accident.

Who holds the advantage in build-up to the Ashes
England and Australia tasted surprise Test defeat to West Indies and Bangladesh....:
LAWRENCE BOOTH
Only a few hours after a leading sports show in Australia tweeted its amusement at Englands defeat by West Indies at Headingley, the boot was placed firmly on the other foot.
Hows that Ashes prep going, lads wondered ABC Grandstand following the heroics of Shai Hope and Co in Leeds. But when Australia slumped to a 20-run loss to Bangladesh in Dhaka, the same question was returned with interest by England fans.
Its fair to say that, with less than three months to go before the Ashes, England and Australia both have questions to answer. And both have only one Test left before they meet in Brisbane on November 23. Sportsmail looks at how the two sides are placed.
THE OPENERS
David Warner could be the star of the Ashes. By the time he was dismissed in Australias fourth-innings chase with the total on 158, Warner had 112 of them. And he averages 59 in 33 home Tests, with 14 hundreds. But Alastair Cook scored 243 against West Indies at Edgbaston and totalled 766 runs in Australia during Englands victorious 2010-11 visit.
The worries are elsewhere: Australias Matt Renshaw has played only nine Tests and Englands Mark Stoneman  Cooks likeliest partner at the Gabba, unless Haseeb Hameed starts scoring hundreds for Lancashire  just two. Stoneman made a confidence-boosting half-century in the second innings at Headingley, but the Middlesbrough-born Renshaw already has a Test hundred under his belt and looks to have the ideal temperament.
THE MIDDLE ORDER
If Steve Smith and Joe Root, the captains and two of the best batsmen in the world, could well cancel each other out, neither can completely gloss over other issues.
Tom Westley has faded since starting his Test career impressively against South Africa at The Oval, although Dawid Malan may well have booked his Ashes place with a pair of 60s.
Australia are playing Glenn Maxwell at No 6 in Bangladesh but, thanks to his off-breaks, he has only ever experienced Test cricket in Asia. That means they are no closer to filling the slot after trying both Nic Maddinson  who averaged six  and Hilton Cartwright during the last home summer.
Perhaps most importantly, the Aussies have no equivalent of Ben Stokes, who is growing in stature as a batsman and balances Englands side beautifully.
THE WICKETKEEPER
Jonny Bairstows improved glovework has been one of Englands success stories over the last 18 months and his counter-attacking batting has driven many an opposition captain to distraction.
After England beat South Africa 3-1, the tourists captain Faf du Plessis bemoaned the fact that one of Bairstow, Stokes or Moeen Ali  the engine room at Nos 6-8  will always come off, making England a tough team to bowl out. Australias wicketkeeper Matthew Wade is a real scrapper, but not in the same league with the bat  averaging 29 to Bairstows 40.
THE SPINNERS
Australias off-spinner Nathan Lyon went past Richie Benauds tally of 248 Test wickets at Dhaka and troubled England during the 2013-14 whitewash on unhelpful Australian pitches. He can be especially adept from round the wicket to right-handers. Moeen Ali has had a summer to treasure, claiming 30 victims at 20 apiece, including a hat-trick to wrap up victory over South Africa at The Oval. But Australia can be an unforgiving place for visiting offies.
Its unlikely either side will go for a second slow bowler, although Englands 20-year-old leg-spinner Mason Crane is itching for his chance, having already tasted Australian conditions during a brief stint last winter with New South Wales.
THE FAST BOWLERS
Australians have long been drooling about the prospect of hitting England with a four-man pace attack of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and James Pattinson. But that would involve either playing Wade at No 6  a place too high  or dropping Lyon, which would leave them exposed if the pitch turns.
Injury problems may settle the matter for them anyway. Pattinson is missing the Bangladesh tour because of a sore back and Starc because of a foot injury.
Hazlewood hobbled off at Dhaka with a side strain. All of them are expected to be fit for the Ashes, but how ready will they be for a five-Test series
England are not lacking for seamers themselves: Jimmy Anderson is closing in on 500 Test wickets and Stuart Broad on 400.
Then theres Chris Woakes, Ben Stokes, Mark Wood and Toby Roland-Jones. The selectors will also keep an eye on Nottinghamshires Jake Ball.
But there is a concern: none of Englands bowlers  not even Wood, assuming he is fit  can match Starc, Cummins or Pattinson for pace. And none can match Hazlewood for accuracy. It may come down to who can keep their best seamers on the park across five games in under seven weeks.
