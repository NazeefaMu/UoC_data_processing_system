Trump and Un thrown out of Opening Ceremony
PYEONGCHANG, South Korea, Friday - People dressed up as U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un caused a commotion when they appeared in the stands at the Olympic Games Opening Ceremony on Friday before swiftly being shown out by security staff.
Were getting along great, said the Un lookalike, who declined to give his name.
We wanted to surprise everyone and bring world peace and then were being escorted out by security guards, which I think is really unfair, he added. Doesnt everyone want peace
The ceremony was marked by a show of unity between North and South Korea.
Athletes from both countries entered the arena under a flag depicting a unified Korea as American Vice President Mike Pence and Uns sister, Kim Yo Jong, watched on from a VIP box.
Is my sister getting the same treatment, the Un lookalike said as he was escorted out of the stadium.

47 Russians lose late court bid to compete at Olympics
PYEONGCHANG: South Korea, Friday - Forty-seven Russians implicated in doping lost a last-minute court bid to take part in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics on Friday, just hours before the opening ceremony.
The applicants, who included Korean-born speed skater Victor An, had asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to overturn an International Olympic Committee decision not to invite them to South Korea.
The applications filed by Russian athletes and coaches have been dismissed, CAS secretary general Matthieu Reeb told a packed news conference.
The IOC was swift to welcome the decision, the latest twist in the Russian doping scandal, saying the ruling supports the fight against doping and brings clarity for all athletes.
The Russian situation has proved highly contentious in the build-up to Pyeongchang, after their team was banned but a certain number of clean Russian athletes were allowed to take part as neutrals.
Fifteen of those who lost their bids on Friday were among a group of 28 who controversially had life bans from the Olympics overturned last week by CAS, which cited insufficient evidence.
The other 32, including An, biathlon gold medallist Anton Shipulin and Sergei Ustyugov, a cross-country skiing world champion, were also omitted from the list of Russians invited to Pyeongchang.
In its decisions, the CAS arbitrators have considered that the process created by the IOC to establish an invitation list of Russian athletes to compete as Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) could not be described as a sanction but rather as an eligibility decision, Reeb said.
However, the CAS decision may not be the end of the matter. A source close to the IOC told AFP that the 47 Russians have also lodged a case with a Swiss civil court in Lausanne.
A spokesman for the 168-strong, neutral Russian team, the Olympic Athletes from Russia, declined to comment when approached by AFP.
Russias suspension in December follows the uncovering of a systemic doping conspiracy culminating at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, where host nation Russia topped the medals table.
Investigations revealed an elaborate ploy where tainted Russian urine samples were switched with clean ones overnight using a mousehole in the wall of the Sochi anti-doping laboratory.
Russia has denied any government links to the conspiracy. But the IOC has suspended its former sports minister, Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, for life.
Russias participation has been fiercely debated among athletes and Canadas team was forced to apologise on Thursday after an alleged altercation at the athletes village.
If you have been caught cheating you need to be gone. It needs to be the same for every country, said USA bobsledder Nick Cunningham.
If youre a clean athlete you should compete. If youre not a clean athlete then you should not compete. Theres no grey area for me about it. - AFP

The Attorney Generals Department yesterday filed its written submissions against the bail application filed by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena who had been remanded in connection with the Central Bank Bond issuance.
Deputy Solicitor General Haripriya Jayasundara with Senior State Counsel Lakmini Girihagama appearing on behalf of the Attorney General filed objections in writing against the defence request that they be released on bail.
Last Monday,February 5, the two suspects were ordered to be further remanded till February 16 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne. The Defence Counsel appearing on behalf of the suspects had made a bail application citing that the suspects cannot be charged under the Public Property Act and Penal Code for criminal breach of trust.
The Magistrate stated that she would make an appropriate order regarding the request after perusing legal facts presented by both parties.
Filing its first B report before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court regarding the Central Bank Bond issuance on February 27, 2015, the CID on February 2 named former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran, Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) beneficiary owner Arjun Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena and the PTL as suspects in the case.

All set for LG polls today
Everything is in place to conduct the much awaited Local Government Elections 2018 today.
This is the first time that islandwide Local Government (LG) polls are being held on a single day making it the largest election in the country.
The Local Government Elections is being held after two years during which Special Commissioners had been appointed to administer the Local Government bodies.
The newly introduced mixed-member proportional system sans preferential votes will be practiced for the first time at this election.
Following a new delimitation of electoral wards, the number of LG bodies have increased from 336 to 341 (24 Municipal Councils, 41 Urban Councils, 276 Pradeshiya Sabhas), and the total number of members have increased from 4,486 to 8,356.
The elections will be held for 340 out of the 341 LG authorities.
The election to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha had to be postponed due to an interim injunction issued by the Supreme Court following a petition received against it.
Out of the total number of members, 60 percent will be elected through the First-Past-the-Post System and 40 percent through the Proportional Representation (PR) system. There are 4,750 single member wards and 169 multi-member wards.
This is also the first time, 25 percent quota has been reserved for female representation.
A total of 56,066 candidates have entered the fray from the ticket of various political parties and independent groups. A total of 15,760,867 registered voters are eligible to exercise their franchise at around 13,374 polling centres.
The Election Commission said the voting would commence at 7.00am and end at 4.00pm.
The voter, this time around, only needs to cast a single vote for preferred political party at the ward level. He or she will not have to choose a preferred candidate, but the list of candidates contesting from each party and independent groups will be displayed at the polling stations. The first election result is expected before the midnight today.
A voting card is not compulsory and the electors whose name is present in the voting registry can exercise their franchise after producing a valid identity document. The National Identity Card, valid Passport, valid postal ID, valid Driving License, Government Pensioners Identity Card (issued through the Divisional Secretary), Elders Identity Card, and Temporary Identity Card (issued through the Department of Elections) are recognized as valid identity documents for voting.
Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said a total of 65,758 police and STF personnel has been deployed to provide security for the polls. Out of them 26,840 Police and STF personnel are deployed at polling stations.
Election monitoring groups, Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE), Peoples Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFEREL) and Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) observed an atmosphere conducive to hold free and fair election prevailed in the country. They observed incidents related to pre-election violence and internal clashes in political parties were comparatively less this time around as there was no competition among the candidates for preferential votes.
In addition to the local polls observers, a team of foreign polls observers have also arrived in the country. The delegation includes four observers from India, two from the Maldives, two from Indonesia and two from the Association of World Election Bodies headquartered in South Korea.
All government schools were closed yesterday in view of LG Elections. The postal vote for the LG elections held on January 22, 25 and 26. The Election Commission had accepted around 560,000 applications for postal voting.
The estimated cost to conduct the LG Elections was approximately Rs 4 billion.
The last Local Government Elections were conducted in 2011 in three stages on March 17, July 23 and August 10.

Dissanayake confronts UK Parliamentarians
Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake on Thursday wrote to British Parliamentarians John Ryan and Siobhain McDonagh confronting their recent demand to withdraw Brigadier Priyankara Fernandos diplomatic status over the incident near the Sri Lankan High Commission in London on February 4.
In a strongly worded letter, Dissanayake observed Brig. Fernando was within the premises of the Sri Lankan mission and his acts cannot be questioned, since diplomatically and legally, he was within Sri Lanka and he enjoys full diplomatic immunity for acts done within the embassy compound.
This tradition is an accepted practice in diplomatic regulations and the tradition is followed in all countries, he reminded.
I am the son of the late Gamini Dissanayake, presidential candidate and deputy leader of the United National Party, who was assassinated by the terrorist organization LTTE, the political wing which both of you surreptitiously support. The said organization has been banned in your country and has been designed as a terrorist organization by many countries including yours and the United States, he said in the letter.
On February 4, which marks the national day of Independence for our country, a day of joy and celebration to all Sri Lankans, the front organizations of the LTTE, which the both of you support, gathered a few hundred supporters to protest outside our embassy in the UK. What is most disturbing and offensive to us was the carrying of the LTTE flag and the abusive and vituperative comments made by the protesters, he added.
Both of you have been carrying a deeply hateful, vindictive and offensive campaign against Sri Lanka.
At a time when brutal terrorism has been eradicated and all communities are building bridges to live as one nation, your continued support to front organizations of the LTTE is self-serving and pathetic.
Tell your contacts in these front organizations to contribute to their own brethren without continuing to fuel the flames of hatred and ethnic division. Sri Lanka needs a real sense of reconciliation without individual like you trying your utmost to break the real achievements that are being done on the ground. In any event, we stand with Brig. Fernando steadfastly and he will continue as our defense attach in the UK, Dissanayake said concluding his letter.
A copy of the letter has been sent to Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Boris Johnson M.

Empower local community to improve jumbo conservation
The Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry has launched several programmes to minimise the human-elephant conflict to preserve the wild elephants. Wildlife Conservation Minister Gamini Jayawikcrama Perera recently presented a Cabinet paper in consultation with the President proposing to launch an integrated wild elephant protection and preservation programme.
This article will briefly study Thailands experience in minimising the human elephant conflict with the empowerment of local communities. Perhaps, we can learn a lesson or two out of their observations.
The total population of elephants in Sri Lanka has been declining except in reservations where they are protected. According to statistics, in early 19th century there were 12,000 to 14,000 elephants and in early 20th century it has come down to around 10,000. While the Government authorities maintain we have around 6,000 wild elephants today, some analysts put it down to 2,500 to 4,000.
In some reservations, the elephants population growth is outstripping available food and water sources. Elephants respond by going outside into local villages looking for their basic needs. The result is what we term human-elephant conflict.
In addition to this issue, over the last century, forest cover in our country has dropped dramatically. Sri Lankas forest cover, which was around 49% in 1920, has fallen to approximately 18% by now. The reasons attributed for this downfall are the threats such as illegal logging, wildlife trade, land encroachment, forest fire and human-elephant conflicts. This predicament poses a serious problem to the elephants continued existence.
Crop and property damage are perhaps two of the most disastrous consequences of the conflict. Elephants can destroy large area of crops in a single night. Elephants also kill and injure people. Some die while trying to protect their crops or while walking at night between neighbouring villages. According to Government statistics, 79 wild elephants and 23 villagers had been killed due to human-elephant conflict in the past two years.
The challenge
Therefore, we do have a serious challenge and it is heartening to note that the government is taken note of it and moving with some solutions.
Thailand also has the same problem. Years ago, they carried out many studies and out of the lessons learnt, wide range of measures and management strategies have been employed to mitigate human elephant conflict. Thai experts suggest that habitat improvements in the wildlife sanctuaries could make it more hospitable to the elephants. The theory is that this would remove any incentive for the elephants to leave the protected area. The experts also suggest a range of other options that could be considered, including the use of contraception for female elephants, land-use changes and electric fences.
Thai authoritys habitat improvement and the use of electric fences would be the most efficient options as short and medium-term solutions. These options were also preferred by the community members.
Study
A comprehensive survey was undertaken. When community members were asked whether they would be willing to volunteer to work to improve habitats for elephants, 93% said that they would be willing to do so. More than half of respondents stated that they did not hate the elephants, but that they also did not want them to raid their crops. These attitudes indicate that local people are willing to support and take part in possible future mitigation measures.
According to the experts, the results of this study will be useful for policymakers and will help them select which policy intervention to employ in the future. However, the study noted that short and medium-term solutions will only reduce the conflict, but not eliminate it. The study recommended that other mitigations measures proposed in the policy options such as land use changes and contraception for female elephants must be put in place to arrive at a permanent solution.
For example, while it was known that land use change contributed to human elephant conflict, it had never been quantified over time. Number of studies were undertaken to assess changes in land use/land cover in many districts and their impact of human-elephant conflict. This research offered baseline information for land use planning to balance wildlife conservation with livelihood development.
Public participation
Based on the results of the study, Thailand initiated in 2012, a community-based elephant conservation project known as Bring the Elephant Home (BTEH) in one of its wildlife sanctuaries. By providing financial assistance, social recognition, and ecological restoration expertise, BTEH and local community leaders encouraged the local community to engage in conservation activities.
BTEH focused most of their conservation activities on community participation, education, awareness raising and capacity building on elephant conservation and forest restoration. The projects prime objective was to restore forest cover and make it a healthy, balanced habitat for wild elephants, thereby lessening the need for the elephants to roam outside the protected area.
In 2015, BTEH received a grant to launch the Conservation Leadership Programme, allowing the organisation to grow and facilitate capacity building. This unique training programme allowed conservation champions/leaders to make a real difference for wildlife. Through the programme, the project established small teams, comprising of local community leaders and sanctuary officers, to be more pro-active in their conservation efforts.
Rather than choosing expensive solutions to prevent elephants from going out of protected areas, such as electric fences, the team explores new solutions, such as joint monitoring plan, crop/livelihood changes, education programme and beehive fence control.
In October 2015, BTEH and conservation leaders conducted a survey, interviewing people who lived around the selected sanctuary. The survey findings were as follows: (1) People working in the agricultural sector have a more negative impression of elephants because elephants raid crops; (2) People who gain benefits through a community-based conservation programme have a much more positive attitude towards the elephants; (3) Most people (87%) feel that it is important to invest in elephant conservation initiatives because they have a long history of coexisting harmoniously with the elephants and the fact that the elephant is considered a cultural icon.
Dealing with conflict
In addition to the assessment, BTEH also organised a Participatory Action Research session to bring community members and forest rangers together to talk about conflict reconciliation.
Participatory Action Research facilitated dialogue and stimulated ownership of conservation projects by community members. Under the common goal A healthy environment for elephants brings peoples happiness, the activities that were desired by both communities and forest officers were (1) a joint elephant patrolling programme, (2) promotion of environmental safeguards - such as forest restoration and improvement of tree nurseries.
In addition to the two issues above, group also presented other strategies to mitigate the conflict, which are: (1) introducing a bamboo collection control system, (2) introducing bee-hive fencing system (3) enhancing electric fencing capacity, (iii) planting economic plants in the buffer zone that are disliked by elephants and (iv) adding more water sources inside protected areas.
Regarding bees and elephants, it is a well-known fact that elephants are afraid of bees. They even have a specific rumble to warn each other of the threat of bees.
The bees presence deters elephants from encroaching on farmers lands. Initially, the beehive fence research work was inspired by the success stories in Kenya. The first beehive-fencing project in Thailand, has shown promising results.
In addition, BTEH also realized that the human elephant conflict cannot be absolutely eliminated as the closed proximity of croplands to the reserved areas.
The strategy to mitigate this problem in future needs adaptive management by discussing and coordinating with the stakeholders (local communities, wildlife researcher, forest rangers, NGOs and other agencies both at the national and local levels).

The league match of the season against Havelocks SC will be special for Fazil Marija as he will make his last appearance for Kandy SC at Nittawela before hanging up his boots. The Clifford Cup knockout matches will not be played at Nittawela. This veteran is one of the best players in his position as fly half and his decision-making and general play helped Kandy SC to be victorious. His performances has been one of the standout features for his school Kingwood College, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka. Fazil retired from national rugby last year having played for the country for 14 years. His last game for Sri Lanka was in the final to Malaysia at this years Asia Division I championship in Malaysia. As a schoolboy he was spotted by Kandy SCs godfather Malik Samarawickrema in the match between Kingswood and Royal, and was invited to play in the Clifford Cup knockouts and today he is a legend inrugby.
Municipal Community sports centres blown off side
Sports at Municipal Council Community Centres has been blown off side by themselves. In the good old days they gave a big hand to promote sports like TT, Carrom, Chess, Iron Sports through the Playgrounds Department Community centers, at grass root level, among the poor youth. They had 42 community centres but sad to say now nearly 13 centres have been closed and they are planning to give these to outsiders, which is going to affect the young sports lovers in a bad way. Some of the closed centresare at Deyanawella, Katugastota Road, Getembe, Wattegoda, Yatiyawella, Bogambara, Aniwattha West, Devi Road, Nawa Katukelle, Jalasayapara, Simonwatha, Asgiriya, Pooranawatha and Galklandewatha. All these centres closed down in the last five years. These centres were provided by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department in the urban area and the New Territories with table tennis tables, fitness rooms, Iron sports rooms, Carrom boards, Chess boards, TV facilities etc.
Rajans have lost 5 games
Dharmaraja is one of the oldest cricket playing schools in the country and this season they are not in good form. They have lost five games and are not doing so well. They lost to Joseph Vaz, Wennappuwa by an innings, Gurukula, St Anthonys, Royal and Nalanda (for the Bandula Warnapura Trophy). The traditional; game played for the P.W.Perera Trophy was called off on the second day as only 10 overs play was possible due to rain and Ananda retained the trophy.
Club football forgotten in Kandy
The year 2017 was one of the worst years for football at club level in Kandy. No tournaments or AGM was held. Kandy was once a powerhouse of Sri Lanka club football. But today it is in a forgotten state. The FFSL is not showing any interest in Kandy football. It is time they woke up from their deep slumber and started to move the game of football in Kandy in the right direction which has today received step motherly treatment.
Dialogs Suren wins at golf
Suren Prematilake, a product of Trinity College attached to Dialog, who is a keen follower of golf did well to win the C division plum in the annual Nuwara Eliya Golf Club championship. Suren is a pretty good golfer, if he takes the game seriously he is sure to win more and more tournaments. He has played on golf courses all over the country.
Antonians on a winning note
A change of format brought through their new coach Sampath Perera has a brought a change for the Katugastota Antonians. They have won eight matches this season after losing the first game.
At one time they were a major force in school cricket producing not only several champion teams but have also some of the finest cricketers who have done the country proud by their achievements. Thanks to Sampath Pereras coaching cricket is back on a good footing. Last season they had a good chance of getting promoted but the losses to St. Benedict's and Vidyartha deprived them of it. They are now in a position to get that overdue promotion to Division I category,

Five great cricketers who should not have played T20 cricket
Well, the game loved by billions set foot into a daunting phase in the year 2005 when the first ever T20I was played. How does it affect the technique Are the players capable of adapting Will this mark the end of Test cricket These were the questions that were pondered over in the eventuality of T20 crickets inception.
However, today the game is highly popular amongst the cricketing fraternity and credit must be given to the ICC and the cricketers as well- Test cricket has survived and it has also evaded the endangered tag with ease.
Till date, many great cricketers have had a shot at adapting to the challenging format and many have even quit the longest format for T20s. Perhaps, quite a few of them should have never played the T20 format of the game, simply because they werent really exceptional as they were in the other formats of the game.
Lets look at the 5 great players who should have never played T20 cricket.
5 SHIVNARINE CHANDERPAUL
Infamous for his crab-like batting stance, the unconventional Shivnarine Chanderpaul has had his fair share of glory across two decades of his cricketing career.
With over 20,000 runs in ODI and Test matches combined, despite his unorthodox technique, Chanderpaul was a colossal presence and averaged 51.37 in Tests with 30 Test hundreds to his name.
Come to the T20 format, he represented Windies for 22 Internationals but possessed a hapless average of 20.17 with 41 being his highest score. He last played T20I in 2010 but plied his trade in many domestic camps since then, but only to managed a T20 career average of 23.
Strictly, Chanderpaul should have distanced himself from the shortest format to take more pride in the immense success he garnered in the other two formats of the game.
4 SOURAV GANGULY
A man of aggression; a leader with passion; a shot through the covers with perfection. This sums up the Bengal Tiger who is one of the greatest left-handed batsmen to have graced Indian cricket.
From attacking the spinners to playing over the in-field to cleverly pacing an innings, Sourav Ganguly was a master with averages of 42.17 and 41.02 in Tests and ODIs, respectively. With age being a dominant factor in the shortest format of the game and with the inception of T20 cricket in Gangulys final phase of his career, he played only in the IPL but struggled to make an impact and cement his position in the line-up.
He represented KKR and Pune Warriors India in the IPL but showcased a poor strike rate of just 107. The bottom line is that Dada could not repeat his heroics in the shortest format of the game.
3 VVS LAXMAN
When you talk about Australia, you talk about VVS Laxman. When you talk about victorious chases, you talk about Very Very Special Laxman.
One of the most proficient right-handers to have represented India, Laxman was the calm and composed head that solidified the middle order in Test matches.
He did a decent job in the ODIs but in the Test arena, he secured a name as one of the batting greats, with an average close to 46, which was combined with adroit wrists and delightful stroke play.
In the shortest format of the game, he played for Deccan Chargers and Kochi Tuskers Kerala but failed to leave any footprint as his average slumped to just 22.31 with a strike rate of 114.71. Simply, the game was too demanding for the crafty player.
2 RICKY PONTING
In the history of Australian cricket, Ricky Ponting is second to only one and that is Sir Donald Bradman. From three World Cups to 71 career hundreds, Ricky Ponting was the protagonist and the face of Australian cricket in the 21st century.
Ponting boasts of a staggering Test average of 51.85 with 13,378 runs and along with an ODI average of 42.03, that comprises thirty centuries, he is certainly a modern day great.
Ponting was gifted with the ability to adapt and thrive at will in any format of the game. But the greatest ever Australian skipper struggled to consolidate the same in the T20 format as he averaged just over 25 in the T20 format with a strike rate close to 121.
The Punter registered only 2 international fifties, with his career-best score being 98. Apart from these figures, Ponting had a daunting task adjusting to the emphatic requirements of the T20 format.
1 JAMES ANDERSON
Simply a genius in the Test arena, Jimmy Anderson is Englands highest wicket-taker in the Tests and ODIs. No current English bowler is close to surpassing Andersons degree of achievement.
He has 269 wickets in the ODIs with an impressive economy of 4.92 and in the longest format, he has 523 scalps at a strike-rate of 56.5. Overwhelmingly, Anderson couldnt manufacture anything similar in the shortest format of the game.
He was punished at hemorrhaging rate in the T20, which is highlighted by his economy of 8.16. He had to toil hard for wickets as well. He has an unhealthy average of 31.40, which emphasizes that he probably should have never played the T20 format. - SK

HelpAge trains elder care assistants
Over 100 males and females, residents of Baddegama, Mawanella and Killinochchi Divisional Secretariats recently participated in training courses as Elder Care Assistants under a special programme, conducted by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) in collaboration with the Prime Minister's office.
The Vocational Training Authority (VTA) and the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) also assisted the 150 day training programme.
Accordingly, all trained personnel received the internationally recognised `National Vocational Qualification Level 2' (NVQ Level 2) certificate which helps them to work as Elder Care Assistants to needy elders in Sri Lankan households and in elder's homes.
In addition, trained personnel with advanced training and experience could also seek employment abroad, especially in Western countries where a large number of vacancies are available for Sri Lankan care workers.
During the in-house training period, the trainees received a theoretical training (class room training) and also a practical training where they were trained to assist elders in their day to day activities.
The trainees also received knowledge on methods of maintaining hygiene and cleanliness of the household environment of the elders.
HelpAge Sri Lanka Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said this was a novel employment generation programme to our country and this special elder care assistance training was given to any interested person between the age group of 18-55 free of charge by HelpAge.
Executive Director Liyanawaduge also thanked the officials of nursing homes, private and public hospitals and elders' homes for extending their unstinted support to carry out the programme during training sessions, conducted in their respective institutions.
Prime Minister's office Vocational and Technical Training Committee Deputy Chairman Asitha Talwatte said the elder care assistant programme helped a large number of persons to obtain employment with higher monthly emoluments.
Prime Minister's Office, Policy Development officer Dr. Nandaka Molagoda urged HelpAge to conduct such elder care training programmes in all districts, especially in rural areas as this programme could be regarded as a part of the creation of the Government's one million employment providing programme.
HelpAge, Home Care Division, Manager Janaka Seneviratna said such programmes will be conducted in future and thanked the Vocational Training Authority and the National Apprenticeship and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) for assisting in the programme.

How to build a rugby player (Part 1)
Night has fallen on a toe-numbing English winter's day. In a manor house, where spirits of aristocrats are rumored to roam ancient hallways, are some of England's finest young athletes.
In a dimly lit, oak-paneled room at Bisham Abbey, 30 miles west of London, these 18 to twentysomethings have gathered for another chapter in their learning.
A grand-looking Victorian lady, framed in gold, peers down on the assembled players and coaches. On these same dark walls hang the works of Raphael. There is no mistaking that this 13th century building has a past.
But despite the antiquities which surround them, this evening is about what lies ahead.
These young men are preparing for a life of distinction. Only the brightest of athletic talents are taught how to cope with media interrogation and social media's potential pitfalls. The world of the sporting elite is no longer just about the physical, the tactical and the mental.
The players, members of England rugby's elite 32-man Under-20 squad -- some of whom were part of the Under 20's Six Nations grand slam-winning team last year -- are being told to think about how they would like to be perceived.
They are told to show their personality, but to use common sense, to assume nothing is private. It is important, he says, to inspire, to promote the sport, to be engaging, to smile. How peculiar it must be as a teenager to have such a destiny.
Such is their age, these athletes have known little other than a life of Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram. What to do with those juvenile tweets from years gone by, published with flippant immaturity Delete. The millionaire stars of today could heed such advice.
This is the third day of a week-long training camp. They have already spent hours on a muddy field, perfecting set-pieces and pre-planned plays, and though daylight vanished some hours ago they are still focusing. There is little of the restlessness associated with the rambunctiousness of youth.
They want to be senior internationals. Listening intently to an hour-long lesson on etiquette and media customs is a fraction of what it takes.
ROBUSTNESS AND INDIVIDUALITY
England Rugby, the world's wealthiest national body, has invested heavily in its youth. The professionalism of the Under-20 set-up, one of the dominant forces in this age group, is the pleasing upshot.
Since its inception in 2008, England have won the Under-20s World Cup three times -- second to New Zealand's five on the all-time list.
No other country has such strength in depth. Despite having a number of players on tour with the senior squad last summer, they still negotiated their way to the World Cup final, admittedly suffering a heavy defeat to the Baby Blacks.
Harlequins' much-talked-about Marcus Smith -- the highest-paid teenager in world rugby -- Saracens' Nick Isiekwe, and Sale Sharks' Tom Curry -- his country's youngest debutant for 19 years but currently injured -- are all still eligible to play at this level, but are part of the senior set-up for the Six Nations, which starts this weekend.
Other than a rudimentary board of honors, which could be easily missed in the room called the "Great Hall," there is little evidence of past successes at the Abbey.
A trophy cabinet would be spilling with silverware -- they have won the U20s Six Nations six times since its formation 10 years ago.
Thirty-one of the seniors' initial 46-man 2018 Six Nations squad are U20s graduates.
Tackle training
But this is not a place to reminisce about the young-boys-made-good. The forthcoming Six Nations, the summer's World Cup, and the hard work ahead is all consuming.
Any youth set-up is a conveyor belt, a factory churning out talent, the pulleys in relentless motion season after season. A rugby player's early years move forward without rest.
But England Rugby, or those in the "pathway" as the country's elite player development program is referred to, are not producing clones. Gone are the days of a homogenous approach to coaching.
"We're trying to get each player to be really individual, charismatic, but it doesn't always have to be extroverted," says Robbie Anderson, the squad's psychologist.
England's current crop are a more introverted bunch than their predecessors of recent seasons. There are spiritual individuals, one of whom reads the Bible on the bus to matches. This is a squad which uses coffee breaks to discuss values.
"They key thing is robustness," says Anderson. "We don't want 23 players who fit into a certain framework.
"They need to ask themselves, 'Am I comfortable with who I am and have I got a support network around me'
"There's people like me looking at the character, Keith Gee is looking at the development and education side, so if they hit a speed bump they're not completely and utterly lost."
The brilliant will reach the pinnacle, but even the good -- of which all in this squad are -- will likely earn a living in the professional game.
But, as Anderson warns, each player, no matter how dizzying their skill, is one injury away from ruination.
INJURIES, CONCUSSION, 'CANNON FODDER'
Another training day, another brutally cold January morning. Heads retract into shoulders like frightened tortoises, such is the air's bite. Only the active stay warm on a day such as this.
England's forwards, not yet fully evolved into granite-jawed beasts, are in the gymnasium making heavy weights look featherlight. The players come in various shapes and sizes, and that, to an extent, is still rugby union's charm.
Watching on is the squad's medical team. These are players in transition and must be treated carefully. Once kings at school age, many are now fledgling professionals, absorbing brutal hits from hardened club players.
Dr. Phil Riley explains that his team's role is not solely to mend. They are here to also prevent and educate.
"Most of them have left school, where they were important, big players, and have gone to a club environment where they're expected to turn up every day and perform every day and are used a little as cannon fodder," he says.
"They go from being less susceptible to injury, because they are the biggest players, to more susceptible.
"We work with our strength and conditioning team and get to know the players well -- their injury history, the problems they've faced in the past -- and try to develop appropriate training programs, medical programs, and rehab programs to either prevent first injury or prevent second injury."
Concussion, of course, is still rugby union's biggest problem. The Rugby Football Union's most recent annual injury audit revealed that concussion accounted for a quarter of match-day injuries.
During the last five years laws have been changed, protocols enhanced, players educated and medics empowered. All of this, says Riley, has brought a "sea change" in coaching culture.
"We haven't got it right," admits Riley. "But we're working towards identifying it, managing it and removing players when there's concern."
SECRET CALLS, SHOWING LEADERSHIP
While the forwards are in the gym, the squad's backline -- the speedsters, the creatives -- are a short stroll away in the Abbey, thinking up strategies to outwit the opposition. In an hour or so, the two groups will trade places.
Pre-planned moves are being written into books. Come Friday night against Italy in Gorizia, these theories will come as naturally to them on the field as flying is to birds. Or that is the plan.
Each move has a name, ones which can't be printed here for fear of giving rivals an advantage. To the uninitiated, the players are talking in riddles. Incongruous nouns are thrown into the middle of sentences. Raised eyebrows can be the only reaction of those not in the know.
They scribble, they whisper and then they openly discuss.
What is notable is that it is the players who dominate the conversation. A coach, in this instance James Ponton, poses questions, but it is the players who must find solutions. Leadership is a word often repeated inside the camp and here it is in practice.
"There's a lot of onus on the players to know our roles in all of the things that we are doing," says Will Butler, a center in his first professional contract with Premiership club Worcester Warriors.
PLANNING, PLANNING, PLANNING
Though yet 10am, the day is already some hours in the making for the players and coaches.
Two hours ago they took their wellness and hydration tests (urine samples). These examinations can tell coaches and doctors much of what they need to know about each individual (the quality of their sleep, their nutritional needs, muscle soreness and hydration, for example).
Breakfast has been devoured and "unit meetings" conducted -- there will be a further two team meetings before the day's end.
Such a detailed approach creates data. Lots of it. The man absorbing this stream of statistics is strength and conditioning coach Robin Eager. There is a wealth of information to filter, he says. It is non-stop.
A typical day will involve copious amounts of planning. He will be in the gym, getting the players stronger and more powerful, and he will discuss with the coaches how best to organize sessions. How hard should a player be pushed Eager will have the answer.
"If the planning process is good, my communication with coaches can be 'yes, we're on plan' and that's all they need to know," he says, admitting that neither coaches or players enjoy deciphering spreadsheets.
The majority of his time will be spent liaising with Premiership clubs, for England only have these players at their disposal for 13 weeks a year. The responsibility of getting a player ready for international rugby rests not solely with the union.

Jaffna potato farmers await sales
Potato farmers in the North undergo severe hardships to sell their produce at least at Rs.50 per kilo at the Dambulla Economic Centre.
Imported potatoes are available at the centre at Rs.36 to Rs.40 per kilo while Jaffna farmers are languishing at the locations without a deal whole day, sources said.
The centre is receiving large stocks of potatoes daily from the Jaffna peninsula as its farmers have received a bumper potato harvest this season.
Their potatoes have been stored all over the economic centre and Jaffna farmers are sitting on their potato sacks without any sale.

Kirama Divisional Hospital ailing
The Kirama Divisional Hospital lacks doctors, nurses and minor staff and over 400 people who seek treatment from its OPD daily undergo severe difficulties as they have to wait from morning to evening to consult a doctor and receive medicines.
The hospital has about 60 inmates at any given time and they do not receive proper treatment as the hospital lacks adequate doctors and staff.
The hospital lacks a mortuary and dead bodies are kept in wards until relatives of the dead remove the bodies. The well from where the hospital receives drinking water remains polluted. Since the hospital lacks facilities to perform post mortems, dead bodies have to be transferred to the Katuwana and Walasmulla hospitals. The hospital has no proper kitchen and its staff work at a small hut by the hospital.
Plans are afoot to set up a mortuary and a kitchen funded by the World Bank, hospital sources said.

Corruption charges against former CJ, CA judge:
LfD wants Lankan judges to follow Indian Supreme Court
The Lawyers for Democracy (LfD) has urged stakeholders in the justice system in Sri Lanka to learn from Indian Judges.It wants a frank discussion on lessons learnt from corruption cases files against Chief Justice and a sitting Appeal Court judge.
The Lawyers for Democracy have expressed their admiration and appreciation for the action taken by the four Supreme Court judges in India last week, where they took the extraordinary step of holding a press conference to inform the public of irregularities that were happening in case administration in the Supreme Court of India under the leadership of the incumbent Chief Justice.
Indian judges took this extraordinary step after informing the Chief Justice that the traditional manner in which the Supreme Court procedures were followed was being flouted by recent actions by the Chief Justice. For example, cases were being fixed for hearing without following the traditional procedures that ensured transparency devoid of bias.The judges had first made their representations to the Chief Justice on these matters, seeking corrective measures.
When that failed, the judges took upon themselves the responsibility of informing the public so that the public would do whatever possible to ensure that the best traditions of the administration of justice are preserved.The judges, at the press conference, pointed out that if the present transgressions continue, best practice standards would suffer and a degeneration of the system would take place over the coming years.
This extraordinary call for caution demonstrates the uncompromising attitude of Indian judges when it comes to the preservation of the traditions of the independence of judiciary. Instead of keeping silence and letting these transgressions continue, they took their obligations seriously and intervened with the view to informing the public so that the public could make informed interventions to ensure that those responsible for systems of administration preserve the best traditions, on which their own protection depends. This courageous and farsighted action needs to be reflected upon and the lessons of such great interventions should be learned by us in Sri Lanka too.
Had there been similar interventions during such transgressions in recent decades, particularly during the administration of Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva, our own system would not have suffered the damage that it has unfortunately suffered. Courageous actions, internally and externally, to prevent any interference with the traditions that preserve the independence of judiciary, which win the confidence of the public, are at the very core of the preservation of the rule of law itself.
This great learning experience needs to become part of our own traditions. Debates and discussions on these issues in no way damage the image of the judiciary. Instead, it enhances the confidence of the people, as already demonstrated by the extraordinary support the four judges won from the Indian Bar and the Indian public. Therefore, measures such as contempt of court proceedings should never be used in order to prevent vital discussions on the preservation of the best traditions of the judiciary.
In Sri Lanka, we are now faced with a situation where a former Chief Justice (one time an Attorney General) and a serving Court of Appeal judge have been charged for corruption. We do not wish to comment on the merits of the case. Our purpose is to draw attention to the fact that two of the judges of the highest courts are facing charges with criminal violations, and how this relates to our institutional problems. The absolute integrity of those who sit in our highest courts is the last and final safeguard of the most important institution protecting the people: the judiciary. When extraordinary problems, such as those manifested in these charges, are brought to the surface, it should be a moment when all concerned with the administration of justice engage in serious reflections about the predicament of the system on which their own survival depends.
The survival of traditions protecting the administration of justices is necessary for the entire nation. Therefore, it is the right of the people of the nation to examine the circumstances under which such matters have become possible, examine the root causes of these problems and take immediate measures in order to ensure that correcting lasting actions are taken towards the restoration of the traditions that preserve the independence of judiciary.
Such a debate is now a dire need among the public as well as among the lawyers. A fearless but dignified bar is an essential element for the preservation of democratic traditions and the traditions protecting judiciary are at the core. If the lawyers keep silent when the very ground on which their own profession rests is uncertain, and perhaps suffer serious peril, their own capacity to engage in their profession with integrity will suffer greatly. If that happens, thats a national tragedy.
Any attempt by an individual or an association (including the lawyers) challenging, except before a court of law, the authority of the CIOBAC will no doubt amount to an interface of the CIOBAC. What is required is a frank discussion on this case and not a challenge, the LfD said in a statement.
The democratic means by which such tragedies are prevented is eternal vigilance. Now the time has come to express our own capacity to keep a vigilant eye on our institutions and show that we do have the courage to intervene when interventions are necessary. Let us all emulate the great example set by the four judges of the Indian Supreme Court.

The Maldives, a honeymoon haven in peril
Famed as an upmarket tourist destination of white beaches and turquoise waters, the island nation of the Maldives is troubled by political turmoil and rising sea levels.
The country is a collection of 26 atolls made up of 1,192 tiny islands scattered 800 kilometres (550 miles) across the equator.
Only 200 islands are inhabited with the countrys population put at 340,000 in the last census but estimated at around 417,000 in 2016 by the World Bank.
Its 298 square kilometres (115 square miles) are home to about three percent of the worlds coral reefs.
Tourism is the principal income earner, providing 41 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2016 and nearly 20 percent of jobs, the World Travel and Tourism Council says.
The archipelagos beauty drew around 1.28 million tourists in 2016, a four-percent rise over the previous year, according to UNs World Tourism Organization data.
It is a destination especially prized among honeymooners, such as Hollywood stars Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes who visited in 2006.
Human rights activist Mohamed Nasheed
Maumoon Abdul Gayoom ruled with an iron fist for 30 years until 2008, when he lost the first multi-party polls to human rights activist Mohamed Nasheed.
Nasheed was forced to resign in 2012 after a police mutiny and demonstrations that he said were part of a coup plot.
In disputed elections the following year, he was defeated by Gayooms half brother, Abdulla Yameen, the current president.
In 2015 Nasheed was sentenced to 13 years in jail on a terrorism charge widely criticised as politically motivated.
In 2016 he was granted prison leave for medical treatment in London, where he secured political asylum with the help of high-profile human rights lawyer Amal Clooney.
While Nasheed continues to push for change from exile, Yameen declared a state of emergency on February 6 after judges ordered the release of his opponents.
Eighty percent of the Maldives is less than a metre above sea level, making it one of the countries most threatened by rising sea levels linked to climate warming.
In 2009 Nasheed held a cabinet meeting underwater to raise awareness of the risk, also warning his people could become climate refugees.
Situated along Indian Ocean trading routes and about 650 kilometres southwest of Sri Lanka, the Maldives has been colonised several times.
Once a Buddhist kingdom, it converted to Islam around the 12th century.
Portuguese explorers occupied the main island of Mahe in the 16th century. The territory then became protectorates of the Dutch and the British before complete independence on 1965.
Sunni Islam today remains the state religion, all other religions being banned.
The Maldives follows a moderate version of Islam while banning alcohol, except in tourist hotels, and homosexuality.
It also flogs women found guilty of fornication, says Amnesty International, which is critical of the human rights situation that it says includes restrictions on peaceful protests and expression.
The Maldives left the Commonwealth in 2016 in a row over criticism of its rights record.
There are fears of radicalisation with the arrival of Middle East preachers and via radical websites.
Nearly 60 Maldivians are known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight with foreign Jihadists, and some are believed to have returned.
In travel advice issued this year, the United States urged increased caution due to the possibility of a terror attack.
The Maldives on Tuesday sought to reassure tourists they would be safe as governments warned their citizens to steer clear of the troubled honeymoon islands amid a spiralling political crisis.
India and China advised their holidaymakers against visiting the tropical archipelago after a state of emergency was declared by the regime of President Abdulla Yameen.
Tourism is a key earner for the Maldives but a dramatic confrontation between Yameen and the security forces against the Supreme Court has further eroded its reputation as an idyllic atoll nation.
Government spokesman Ibrahim Hussain Shihab said no curfew had been declared and the safety of tourists in the upmarket holiday paradise was assured.
The government would facilitate calm at a time of national difficulty, he added.
But China -- the number-one source of tourists for the Maldives -- has urged its citizens against visiting the Indian Ocean nation.
The warning from Chinas foreign ministry comes ahead of the Spring Festival -- the peak period for Chinese tourists to visit the Maldives.
Given the security situation there, we advise the Chinese tourists who are now in the Maldives to closely follow the security situation and enhance self-protection, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular briefing.
In the meanwhile, Chinese citizens are advised to avoid going to the Maldives until the situation on the ground is stabilised.
India and France and other European nations also advised its citizens against non-essential travel.
The United States advised caution, warning of further protests in coming days across the capital Male in response to emerging political developments.
You should avoid areas of demonstrations and exercise caution if in the vicinity of any large gatherings, protests, or demonstrations, the US embassy in Colombo said in its updated travel advice on Tuesday.
Supreme Court
In the latest escalation of the crisis, police clashed with opposition supporters outside the Supreme Court as troops stormed the building to arrest the chief justice and another judge at dawn Tuesday.
Hours earlier, they had arrested the countrys former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom after accusing him of orchestrating attempts to topple his estranged half brother Yameen.
President Yameen has refused to comply with a court order to release political prisoners, despite growing international pressure and concern.
Political turbulence under Yameen -- who was elected in a controversial run-off in 2013 -- has dented the Maldives image as an island paradise, but most tourists are insulated from the turmoil in Male.
The airport is a short boat journey from the capital and many visitors are whisked away to resorts on remote, serene islands spread 800 kilometres (550 miles) across the equator.
Nearly 1.4 million foreigners visiting the Maldives last year, up from 1.28 million the previous year. - AFP

Peaceful campaign, say election watchdog groups
Election watchdog groups observed that the run-up to the Local Government Elections 2018 was one of the most peaceful witnessed in the country.
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Rajith Keerthi Tennakoon said that even though this is the biggest election in the entire history with over 52,000 candidates, generally a peaceful environment prevailed throughout the election period.
He commended the services of the Election Commission and the Police, adding that they took immediate action on incidents related to election violence and violation of election laws.
In the meantime, Tennakoon said that the scale and gravity of election law violations are very low compared to previous elections.
There are many people to attend to the complaints received. Therefore, we see a marked increase in the engagement of the people as well, he said.
Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) National Co-ordinator Manjula Gajanayake said they will deploy 2,000 static observers, 100 mobile observers and around 90 field observers on the poll day.
He said that they intend to cover a minimum of 6,000 polling stations island wide.
Gajanayake also affirmed that a very peaceful environment was maintained in the pre-election period.
In the meantime, CaFFE informed that they have deployed nearly 50,000 election observers all over the island. So far the CaFFE had received around 356 complaints related to violation of election laws.
The Peoples Actions for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFERAL) has deployed about 7,000 well-trained and well-equipped volunteers as observers for the Local Government Elections. Among them, 1,000 were in service during the postal voting at different points and another 4,000 would be placed at polling booths. Over 1,500 will function as mobile observers using 350 vehicles to visit various polling stations and surrounding areas.

Petrol shed blamed for  mixing petrol with kerosene
Customers and workers of a private petrol shed at Kandasurindugama road in Kataragama engaged in an heated argument yesterday when the customers alleged that the fuel they received from the petrol shed had been mixed with kerosene oil.
Residents complained that many motorcycles had mechanical failures due to this reason and that the fuel obtained from the shed was discovered to be mixed with kerosene upon testing. Many three wheelers and motorcycles emanated kerosene smell after the petrol shed pumped fuel to them.
The people who purchased petrol from the shed lodged complaints at the Kataragama Police station regarding the matter and the workers have subsequently stopped pumping petrol.
The workers at the petrol shed said they were unable to comment on the issue. They said that the petrol released to the public was provided by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) through petrol bowsers.

PM's office partners HelpAge to train Elder Care Assistants
Over 100 males and females, residents of Baddegama, Mawanella and Killinochchi Divisional Secretariats recently participated in training courses as Elder Care Assistants under a special programme, conducted by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) in collaboration with th Prime Minister's office.
The Vocational Training Authority (VTA) and the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority (NAITA) also assisted the 150 day training programme.
Accordingly, all trained personnel received the internationally recognised `National Vocational Qualification Level 2' (NVQ Level 2) certificate which helps them to work as Elder Care Assistants to needy elders in Sri Lankan households and in elder's homes.
In addition, trained personnel with advanced training and experience could also seek employment abroad, especially in Western countries where a large number of vacancies are available for Sri Lankan care workers.
During the in-house training period the trainees received a theoretical training (class room training) and also a practical training where they were trained to assist elders in their day today activities.
The trainees also received the knowledge on methods of maintaining hygiene and cleanliness of the household environment of the elders.
HelpAge Sri Lanka, Executive Director Samantha Liyanawaduge said this is a novel employment generation programme to our country and this special elder care assistance training is given to any interested person between the age group of 18-55 free of charge by HelpAge.
Executive Director Liyanawaduge also thanked the officials of nursing homes, private and public hospitals and elders homes for extending their unstinted support to carry out the programme during training sessions, conducted in their respective institutions.
Prime Minister's office Vocational and Technical Training Committee Deputy Chairman Asitha Talwatte said the elder care assistant programme helps a large number of persons to obtain employment with higher monthly emoluments.
Prime Minister's Office, Policy Development officer Dr. Nandaka Molagoda urged HelpAge to conduct such elder care training programmes in all districts, especially in rural areas as this programme could be regarded as a part of the creation of the Government's one million employment providing programme.

Power to the people
D-day is here, with the Local Government polls finally seeing the light of day today after a delay caused by the delimitation exercise. It was a justifiable delay, because demographics and needs of the people in various districts have changed over the last few decades and a redrawing of the electoral map was in order.
Nearly 15.7 million voters are eligible to vote at 13,000 polling centres in todays election, which is being contested by a record 57,000 candidates from political parties and independent groups. They will be vying for nearly 8,000 councillor posts in 341 local bodies islandwide. Over 175,000 public servants and 65,000 Police personnel (both groups who have already cast their votes) will be deployed for election duties. The results are likely to be announced after midnight today.
This Local Poll is significant in many ways. It is the first election being held islandwide after the delimitation process, but even more importantly it is the first election being held under the new mixed electoral system. It is a mix of the First-Past-the-Post and the Proportional Representation (PR) system. The new Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system is said to be much more practical and fairer by all candidates.
The ending of the PR system in the form that we knew is a major victory for all Sri Lankans. It was one of the biggest negative points about our electoral process. The PR system, with its Manape or preference vote made elections a minefield, with many candidates spending millions of rupees on promoting their image and intimidating rival candidates in their own party, leave alone other candidates. Only those who could afford to splash millions could campaign in an entire district, after all.
At this election, however, candidates will be elected from wards, which is perhaps the smallest governing unit in the country, so the question of engaging in propaganda in an entire distract does not arise. Hence, campaign costs can be really low and political rivalries too can be kept to a minimum. Going forward, this system will be adapted to national-level elections as well.
The other most important aspect of this election is that all political parties and independent groups have to allocate 25 percent of their nominations to women candidates. It is rather unfortunate that the authorities had to bring in laws to do so, whereas it should have been voluntary effort on the part of political parties. This should have been dome sometime back, but even at this late stage, the correct step has been taken. The participation of women in local governance is at an abysmally low 2 percent. This is inexcusable for a country that produced the worlds first woman Prime Minister, Sirimavo Bandaranaike.
There are several reasons for this shockingly low figure. Politics in Sri Lanka generally runs in the family and only women who already have a male relative in politics (father, brother, uncle, cousin) usually take the plunge. Moreover, the PR system made campaigning a nightmare thanks to huge costs. Worse, most prospective women politicians have been driven away by the tactics of intimidation of male politicians.
In fact, there were reports that powerful male candidates from several political parties had threatened their own female candidates during the recent election campaign. In fact, certain parties had not even adhered to the 25 percent quota for women, which saw the rejection of their lists in certain areas. This is a damning indictment on the present male-dominated political culture. But the silver lining here is that many professionally qualified, educated women have boldly come forward to contest the elections. This is a good omen for the future and we hope that all parties will voluntarily follow the 25 percent quota at the next Provincial Council and General Elections. However, women themselves must take a pro-active role in voting for women.
The election of more youth and women will lead to positive changes in the villages, which is what this election is all about. Despite the rhetoric of certain politicians, this election will not change the Government  it is about electing honest peoples representatives at town and village level. Youth and women have a greater understanding of the developmental and social needs of their villages. They feel the pulse of the grassroots and understand their problems.
Sri Lanka is a vibrant democracy with periodic elections. An election is a costly affair  this election alone costs Rs.4 billion of public funds. This is by no means a small sum and the public should use this opportunity to exercise their democratic right wisely in order to gain the maximum benefit. Nothing good will happen if voters stay at home, even though voting is not compulsory in our country. It is important to vote because this is an election that empowers your village representatives to work on your behalf. They will be your voice in the countrys governance structure. Voters have a responsibility to send in only the best to the respective councils  as the saying goes, bad lawmakers are elected by good citizens who do not vote. Every vote cast today is a vote for democracy.

Protectionist policies hurt Sri Lankas economy - Harvard economist
The Sri Lankan government must reform its import tariffs, to increase exports, Harvard economist Robert Lawrence said Thursday.
Tariffs are the wrong way to raise revenue, he said, addressing an audience at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Lawrence is the Faculty Chair of the Practice of Trade Policy Executive Programme at the Harvard Kennedy School.
He said misplaced protectionist policies had hurt Sri Lankas economy. The decline of exports as a percentage of GDP since the early 2000s, he argued, correlates with the increase of import tariffs.
Professor Lawrence said he could discern no rationale in the implementation of tariffs over the years, and it seemed to him that they are more accurately a history of who had political influence than they are of who is a great economic strategist.
He said Sri Lanka should instead move towards a simpler tariff structure, and implement direct taxes on things like income and property to maintain revenue.
90 percent of your tariffs should be in the simple schedule, and then there may be some exceptions, he said. He added that those exceptions should be for firms that actually had long-run growth potential.
I think an outward orientation is very critical, he said. Also, its hard to judge what you really are competitive in, and what you really could add value in, when you are putting these penalties on your firms by giving them costly inputs.
He cited the example of the booming air conditioning manufacturing industry in South Africa, which developed domestically as a response to hot conditions in gold mines.
Sri Lanka needs to create an environment that rewards investment, he said. And then let a thousand flowers bloom.

Royal vs. Gateway  inaugural  basketball encounter on Feb 17
In order to take basketball to the next level in the country Royal College and Gateway College have joined hands to inaugurate an annual encounter which is a popular concept in Sri Lanka to make basketball a spectator sport.
This encounter will be a first of its kind where Sri Lanka's leading national school and one of oldest in the country, and a premier international school and one of the youngest in the island will join hands to lay an excellent platform for students with diverse values, cultures and backgrounds to bond together in healthy rivalry and comradeship.
The annual encounter will be played for the Alles-Gunasekara Cup named after two key personalities connected to the two schools. Late R I T Alles, commenced his journey as a teacher of Royal College where he served for over 10 years. Alles did yeoman service to the country as the founder Principal of D S Senanayake College and later as the State Secretary of Education.
Remembered by many as one of the finest educators, the country has produced, Alles is also the founder of Gateway College.
Late E Christie Gunasekara, a Royalist himself was a longstanding vice principal of Royal College and former president of the Sri Lanka Schools Basketball Association who is respected for his unrelenting commitment to uplift discipline and standards of Royal College during his days.
Both schools are keen to make this a unique encounter by introducing a new culture with rich traditions that would include activities for spectator engagement and a joint follow-up social welfare program. Due attention will be paid to upcoming talent by including an under 15 match before the main under 19 encounter.
The girls invitation under 19 game between Gateway College and Bishop's College will add colour and diversity to the encounter.
The Royal team captained by Tharindu Pasan Balasooriya has performed well in the season by winning three titles. Initially they won the D S Senanayake Challenge Trophy by beating S. Thomas in their annual encounter. They also won the National School Games basketball Title and Papare Basketball championship (TPBC17). They are planning a tour to Malaysia in March 2018.
The Gateway team is captained by Ishira Ritigahapola who had been the captain or vice captain in many champion teams of the school. He has also been the Junior National Champion in Practical Pistol Shooting for many years, and represented Sri Lanka on many foreign competitions. Last year Gateway College won the All Island Schools Under 17 (A Division) Boys basketball championship.
The school has continually done well in Basketball from the junior level upwards and currently has a strong outfit that can turn the tables. Hence the spectator will be able to view quality basketball and an event with colour.
The encounter will be preceded by an under 15 encounter between the two schools, and a Girls' encounter between Gateway College and Bishop's College Colombo. The concept of playing an annual encounter was initiated by Royal College Basketball Advisory and Management Committee.
A joint committee including the said committee and Gateway College Basketball Committee are organising the event and they are confident that it will create a platform for more children to develop their personalities through healthy competition and bring the communities of both institutions together, on and off the field.
Esteemed Monash University of Australia and Malaysia will be the Principal sponsor of the encounter. Also Papare.com (Dialog Axiata) as the digital partner has agreed to live telecast the event. Asiri Group of Companies will be Healthcare Partner and Hyperfactor will be the Digital Media Partner.

Russia meddled in 2016 US election - Former President George W. Bush
DUBAI: Former US President George W. Bush has accused Russia of meddling in the 2016 US Presidential election, calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a brilliant tactician.
Bush, interviewed on stage at a business conference in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Thursday, said there was clear evidence that the Russians had meddled but whether that affected the outcome of the election was another question.
But they meddled and that is dangerous for democracy, he said, adding that Russia had done the same thing during the Cold War and was adept at trying to manipulate opinion in the United States and Europe.
Putin is a brilliant tactician who has the capacity to detect weakness and exploit it, Bush said.
The Kremlin has repeatedly denied accusations by US intelligence officials and others of interfering in foreign elections, including the 2016 US vote.
In an apparent criticism of the immigration policies of US President Donald Trump, Bush said it was important to recognise that the United States had a history of welcoming people regardless of their religion or where they were born.
Our system is broken but we've got to fix it. I had tried, but unsuccessfully, he said, without naming Trump.
It is important for our economy and also important for our soul that the immigration system functions well.
On Mexico, he said: I view it as a relationship vital for our economy and for our stability. We've got to enforce our borders and we've got to enforce our laws.
There are people willing to do jobs Americans won't do. A lot of Americans don't like picking cotton at 105 degrees. But there are people who want to put food on their family's table and are willing to do that.

Silva fifty puts Lanka on top in second Test
Dhaka, Friday: Roshen Silva hit an unbeaten half-century to put Sri Lanka in command of the second Test after stretching their lead to 312 against Bangladesh in Dhaka on Friday.
The visitors reached 200-8 at stumps on day two in their second innings. The batting effort came after debutant spinner Akila Dananjaya led an inspirational attack to dismiss Bangladesh for 110 in the morning session.
Silva was batting on 58, his second fifty in the game, which came amid a regular fall of wickets on what seemed a difficult batting pitch at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium. The highest successful run-chase at the ground is England's 209-1 against the hosts in 2010.
Suranga Lakmal, who claimed three wickets with his pace bowling, was keeping Silva company on seven as the islanders kept building on their sizable first-innings lead of 112. Paceman Mustafizur Rahman took three wickets while spinners Taijul Islam and Mehedi Hasan Miraz claimed two each.
Opener Kusal Mendis was out early after veteran left-arm spinner Abdur Razzak trapped the batsman leg-before for seven.
Left-handed opener Dimuth Karunaratne, who made 32, and Dhananjaya de Silva, who hit 28, got starts but failed to convert them into bigger scores.
Silva got to the grind building crucial partnerships including a 51-run fifth-wicket stand with skipper Dinesh Chandimal, who made 30.
Earlier Bangladesh, who started the day on 56-4 in response to Sri Lanka's 222, faltered against Dananjaya's mystery spin that rattled the hosts' middle and lower-order.
Dananjaya, who is playing his first Test after 19 one-day internationals and nine Twenty20 games, returning impressive figures of 3-20. The 24-year-old Dananjaya has off-spin as his stock delivery but can can surprise the batsmen with leg-spin googly and carrom balls.
Dananjaya cleaned up skipper Mahmudullah Riyad for 17, and got two more wickets in Sabbir Rahman -- out for a duck -- and Razzak to flatten the Bangladesh batting.
Mehedi, who was sent in as nightwatchman on day one, remained unbeaten on 38 -- the highest score in the Bangladesh innings.
The first Test ended in a draw in Chittagong. AFP

Sinister motives behind Tillerson visit
United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has completed a visit to six Latin American Countries  Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Jamaica, Mexico and Peru in January. The objective of the visit was to ease tensions and improve relations among Latin America and the United States.
Currently, the United States is not very popular in the Continent. There are differences over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the construction of a wall in the US - Mexican border, the inclusion of Latin American countries also in President Trumps derogatory remark about s....... countries, US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord et al.
However, it soon became apparent that its real objectives were sinister. Just before the visit Tillerson, in an address given at the University of Texas indicated the desire of the United States to coordinate an Energy Union extending from Canada to Chile. Nothing could be more familiar to the former CEO, Exxon Mobile Corporation whose association with oil business is four decades long.
When Chvez re-nationalized the oil industry in 2007, his company rejected the conditions of compensation for its contracts in Cerro Negro, in the Orinoco basin. The draconian demand for 1.4 billion dollars in payments for the alleged losses is still maintained. Now, from the State Department, he seems determined to collect revenge.
In the same address he referred to the infamous Monroe doctrine proclaimed in 1823, almost 200 years ago which declared Latin America out of bounds for other powers. Latin America does not need new imperial powers that seek only to benefit their peoples, he said. His remarks were intended for China and Russia whose relations with the continent has been increasing sharply. Tillerson further added, I think it is relevant today as on the day it was written, thus ignoring its anachronistic nature and displaying imperialist arrogance.
The United States had never hidden its hostility towards the Cuban ad Venezuelan revolutions. In the same speech at the University of Texas he called for hardening of the economic blockade of Cuba and his remarks hinted at US plans to influence the outcome of the April elections in Cuba after which President Raul Castro will relinquish his office.
As regards Venezuela also Tillerson did not hide his intentions. He called upon the governments in the region to assist the overthrow of President Maduro, who was elected with a large majority at democratically held elections. He did not rule out military intervention.
When the Secretary of State of the united States encourages military to replace democratically elected governments, it is a very serious matter since Washington has been associated with each and every military conspiracies and coup dtats in the Continent for decades and decades and has openly supported fascist and dictatorial regimes from Mexico to Chile.
Its modus operandi has been causing food and drug shortages, instigating violent mob reactions and an international media campaign disseminating fake news.
Not only did Tillerson receive a lukewarm response to his proposals but also the ground situation has improved in Venezuela. Last January 31st, the Venezuelan Government and the Opposition came to a preliminary agreement on cooperation to peacefully settle their differences following prolonged negotiations in the Dominican Republic.
Negotiations are continuing. President Maduro has already called for Presidential elections next April.
In a bid thwarting United States attempt to exclude Venezuela from the Summit of Americas scheduled in Lima, Peru in April 2018 President Maduro has already accepted the official invitation sent by the President of Peru.
Germany gets a government at last
German Chancellor Angela Merkels CDU/CSU has successfully negotiated a coalition with the SPD to form a government ending four months of uncertainty following the general elections last September.
The SPD or the Social Democrats had earlier ruled out another coalition with Merkel. But since the failure of CDU/CSU talks with FDP (Free Democrats) it changed mind, especially in view of the common challenge from the far right AfD or the neo-fascist Alliance for Germany.
According to the agreement SPD will get six ministries including Finance, Foreign and Labor while CDU will be in charge of key ministries of Defence and Economy among others. SPD Leader Martin Shulz is expected to be the Foreign Minister while Hamburg Mayor Olaf Sholz would become Finance Minister and Vice Chancellor. Andrea Nohles will be the new leader of the SPD, the first woman to hold the post in the partys history. The two parties have 399 seats in the Bundestag which has a total of 789 seats. However, it will be a shaky coalition in view of the political differences of the coalition. Health, housing and refugee policy are particularly sensitive areas.
However, the Agreement has to be ratified by the general membership, of the SPD which numbers over 460,000. Voting will be by post. There is considerable opposition to any agreement with the CDU, especially among the youth who have even formed a group called NOGROCO (No Grand Coalition). If the membership fails to ratify the Agreement Germany will have to face another election, the outcome of which also may turn out to be a hung Parliament.
The European Union has already welcomed the Agreement as a factor guaranteeing political stability in Europe. Investors and friendly countries also are happy that uncertainty will be eliminated.

Sixty two candidates arrested for violating election laws
Sixty two candidates had been arrested by the police so far while several of them are liable to lose their seat, even if they win, in the event they are found guilty. Further they could lose their voting rights for up to seven years, according to the police, Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Convening a media briefing at the Police Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, the Police Spokesman said the Police had taken all measures to ensure a safe, fair and peaceful election today.
All police deployments pertaining to the election had commenced by last afternoon and over 65,000 police personnel have been deployed for election duties.
Around 42 police divisions have been engaged in election duty and by 07.00 am yesterday police mobile patrols had commenced their surveillance duties. Over 3000 mobile units have been deployed while each mobile unit will be on duty at polling centers, covering every polling centre,the Police Spokesman said.
In addition, he said the armed police officers assigned to each polling station were also dispatched yesterday. Two police officers are assigned to each polling station, who have also been issued instructions to maintain law and order at any cost. One police officer from each polling station was assigned to escort the ballot boxes to the respective polling stations. By last evening all polling booths had received the ballot boxes.
The two police officers assigned to each polling station will be on duty from 07.00 am to 04.00 pm and thereafter while the votes are being counted as well. In some instances the ballots of several polling stations will be counted at one location while in others the counting will be done individually, he said.
Adequate police protection has been provided to the counting centers through their mobile units and where required, STF personnel will also be deployed, Gunasekara said, adding that further STF and CSD personnel will be deployed for duty outside polling stations with the authorization of the Elections Commission.
Door to door campaigning banned
All door to door campaigning was banned from Wednesday night while seven persons who had disregarded this order had been arrested during the past two days. However, the Police Spokesman said this was a relatively low figure compared to previous elections. He said the comprehensive security measures implemented by the police was instrumental in keeping the number of incidents to its minimum.
Further the Police Spokesman said no one will be allowed to congregate within a 400 meter radius of any polling centre adding that it is also an offence to act in a manner that will hinder the duties of the election officers at these centers.
He noted that no one under the influence of liquor, either within or in the vicinity of the polling stations, will be permitted. In such instances, the police have been instructed to arrest such persons and charged under the election laws and the penal code under joint charges. Further if the intoxicated person was accompanied by a certain candidate, he/she too will be charged.
Gunasekara noted that last Thursday too another person was arrested for trying to bribe a voter to obtain his vote.
No photographs or videoing within polling centers
The Police media Spokesman stressed that taking photographs/selfies or videoing within the polling centers is strictly prohibited. He said even all media institutions were required to obtain prior written permission from the Election Commission prior to taking photographs either inside or outside the polling centers.
Therefore, he discouraged anyone from engaging in such photographing or videoing and warned that anyone found to break this law would be arrested and charged. The equipment used for photographing or videoing would also be confiscated and produced in court as evidence.This offence, he added comes under LG election ordinance.
Meanwhile, the Police Spokesman thanked the media for being the catalyst that took the message of the police to the people in ensuring a peaceful and incident free election. He said in addition, the candidates and their supporters too had assisted the police in maintaining a free and fair election and said they expected todays elections to sail through smoothly, thanks to the combined efforts of all.
Violations and arrests made so far
SP Ruwan Gunasekara noted that from the date of nominations, a total of 640 election related complaints were received by the Police.
Of them the majority were threats and verbal abuse amounting to 158. In relation to the 640 complaints, 136 arrests were made by the police. Of them 25 were candidates contesting the election. In addition the police had conducted 191 election related raids and the majority of these offences were regarding the illegal display of posters. Pertaining to such incidents, 127 raids were conducted. Through these raids the Police had arrested 372 persons of whom 37 were candidates, he said.
Accordingly, 62 candidates were arrested in relation to election violations. Of them there are some who are liable to lose their seats and voting rights if found guilty in court. These candidates are facing charges of bribing and exerting undue pressure on people for their votes etc. Several of the arrested persons are still in custody while the rest were released on bail. All candidates that were arrested in relation to flouting election laws so far have been released on bail.
He further noted that all 65,000 police personnel deployed for election duties would continue their duty through Sunday, February 11 and the IGP will decide on whether they should be deployed any further, depending on the post election situation.
Responding to a media query with regard to Police using minimum force to bring a situation that might arise, under control, he said there is nothing called minimum force, but the police would not hesitate to take whatever measures required to ensure peace and law and order is maintained.

Sourav Ganguly writes about crying, The End and his fathers death
Sachin Tendulkar was teary-eyed as he bid adieu to international cricket in 2013 at Mumbais Wankhede Stadium. It was quite an emotional moment for the batting legend to leave the sport. Like Tendulkar, did Sourav Ganguly break down after playing his final Test in 2008 The former captain himself has answered in his new book A Century Is Not Enough.
Ganguly left the cricket scene in November 2008 after playing his last Test against Australia. It was an exit like Sir Don Bradman, as he collected a duck in his final knock. However, in the first innings of the Test he had scored 85.
After seven years, the 45-year-old has penned about his The End. Recently, he was asked by a journalist whether he cried or not after quitting. To which Ganguly writes, I dont shed tears. He went on to add that he did not cry even when his father passed away.
Little did I know that the toughest decision of my life was to be announced on a Puja day in 2008. On Mahastami, when celebrations are usually at their peak, two days before the Bengaluru Test, I took part in a press conference. There I announced that I would retire from international cricket at the end of the series, after the last Test match in Nagpur. The bisharjon was still two days away but I had decided to bring an end to my cricketing career. It was The End as they say in the movies. I was so emotionally drained that the Pujas that year passed me by in a blur. I dont remember a thing, Ganguly wrote.
He added, Almost a decade has gone by. Yet journalists and the Kolkata press still gossip about the events leading to my decision, and what I felt at the time. Surely I couldnt have felt as decisive and calm as I appeared that Mahastami day. Even this week as I write this, a close journalist friend asked me with a raised eyebrow, Come on, you dont expect me to believe that after so much trauma you did not cry after playing the last innings in Nagpur
I replied, no. I dont shed tears. I did not cry even at my fathers death. Most of you, like my friend, wont believe me. Sourav is not telling the truth, youll be saying to yourself. But some of you will be nodding your head in agreement. You know my type. We are a minority who tend to think tears are the easy way out of sadness. But dont let our masks fool you. Maybe its because we hold our emotions in check that they remain within us even more. We look tough on the outside, but inside we bleed.
Ganguly took to the micro-blogging website Twitter to share one chapter of his book.
The book will be available month-end, according to the left-hander, who is now the president of Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB).
Known as Prince of Calcutta, Ganguly payed 113 Tests and 311 ODIs. He is one of the most successful captains of India. Under his captaincy India finished runner-up at 2003 World Cup in South Africa. - IBT

SA v India second ODI farce
Umpires face heat after their  controversial decision
India thrashed South Africa by nine wickets in the second ODI played at Super Sport Park, Centurion. The Indian bowlers were outstanding on the day. They did not let the Protea batters get away easily. The wrist spinners of India impressed once again. They left South African batters bamboozled with their trickery. It was hard for them to get away with it.
South African batting was bundled out for just 118 in 30 odd overs. An Indian win was now imminent as South Africa needed a miracle to win from here on. India got off to a fantastic start as Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan showed fluency. However, the former was sent packing and the in-form Indian captain came in to bat.
It was an easy route from there on as the Indian batters were not troubled by the bowlers. However, they were left fuming by the decision the umpires took. India needed two runs to win. Kohli and Dhawan were batting when India was cruising at 117 for 1 in 18 overs. The umpires under these circumstances took a lunch break. The decision of the umpires left everyone bewildered as many were angry. Virat Kohli was furious with it and so was the South African captain Markram. Many experts questioned the decision taken by the umpires. Aleem Dar and Adrian Holdstock along with match referee Andy Pycroft took a harsh decision. They went with the very old rule book of International Cricket Council.
Everybody was left confused as the legendary fast bowler Michael Holding termed it as Ridiculous. The umpires had already extended the lunch break by three overs when India were 93 for 1. India could have won the game in the next five minutes, instead had to wait for the whole of the lunch break for the win.
Virender Sehwag also made fun of the decision over Twitter. He wrote, Umpires treating Indian batsmen like PSU Bank treat customers. Lunch ke baad aana,
Many have thrashed the ICC for their old school rules and are demanding a change in the same.

Westwood joins lead at Perth
Perth, Friday: Former world number one Lee Westwood and defending champion Brett Rumford continued to lead the way at the $1.75m Handa Super 6 in Perth on Friday.
The pair will play together for a third day in a row on Saturday after sharing the lead at the end of the second round at eight under.
They were one stroke ahead of four players on seven under  Denmarks Thorbjorn Olesen, Australian Lucas Herbert, Scotlands Grant Forrest and Thailands Prom Meesawat.
Meesawat was joint leader until the 18th, which he bogeyed.
In challenging conditions Westwood shot a two-under 70 to join Rumford, who couldnt replicate his first round of 64 and shot 72, in the lead.
The Brit, who chipped in on the fourth and sixth holes, said the wind made low scoring difficult.
I know the wind can really pick up in Perth, but you dont expect it to blow quite as strong as its blown today and it was tricky out there, Westwood said.
You really have to have your wits about you.
The unique tri-sanctioned European Tour tournament sees the top 24 after the first three rounds of strokeplay undertake matchplay on the final day to decide the winner.
The top eight qualifiers have a bye in the first round of matchplay on Sunday.
Rumford, who led by five strokes at the end of qualifying last year, held a two-stroke lead after 14 holes, but Westwood joined him with an eagle on the 15th.
A Rumford bogey on the 17th handed the Brit the lead, only for Westwood to also drop a stroke after missing a 2m putt on the last hole.
Thailands Kiradech Aphibarnrat started brilliantly as one of the early groups on the course and briefly held the lead when he moved to nine under.
However, four bogeys in a row on the back nine saw him drop back to finish at five under.
Aphibarnrats countryman Pavit Tangkamolprasert provided the days highlight with a hole-in-one on the 17th on his way to being three under.
Local amateur Minn Woo Lee is also well-placed to reach the final day, the 19-year-old shooting 70 to be five under.
However, two of the biggest names in the tournament failed to make the cut.
The 2016 US Masters champion Danny Willett was unable to recover from his opening round 76 and shot a 75 on day two to finish seven over as his recent form woes continued, missing his third successive cut.
Fellow Englishman Andrew Beef Johnston also struggled in the warm conditions, the world number 161 shooting a 76 on the second day to be five over.
Johnston started the tournament with an eagle on the first hole and barely fired a shot from there, his fate sealed when he had four bogeys in five holes on Friday. - AFP
