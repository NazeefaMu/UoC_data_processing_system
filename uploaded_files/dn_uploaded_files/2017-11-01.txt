Lankan ports still productive compared to others in region
Though India is investing several million on developing over 12 international ports, the three deep-sea Sri Lankan ports could still be productive, said Deputy Minister of Policy Planning and Economic Development Dr. Harsha De Silva.
Speaking at a seminar at Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute he said after being in isolation for several years Sri Lanka is now engaging with the world and this is why GSP Plus and other incentives have come Sri Lankas way.
This would be a tremendous advantage for the future economy of Sri Lanka. Meanwhile keynote speaker of the event Dr Ganeshan Wignaraja said that Sri Lanka can benefit from Chinas proposed One Belt, One Road initiative. He said that both China and India would be major global players that would dictate terms in global economy. Wignaraja said that China though has slowed down was growing around 10% annually in terms of economic growth, while India is averaging around 6% annually. He also said that the world economy which was slowing down has showed signs of picking up and today the growth is around 3.7%. He also said that china had around 158 million US dollars of FDI from 2000 to 2016 and today there is a shift where China is also investing more outside its country. He said that similarly several Indian companies too are going global and are investing overseas.
There are over 200 Indian IT companies doing business in India.

Rising Star Awards 2017 concludes
Concluding the long quest for the most outstanding personalities in the hotel industry, The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) concluded the vibrant award ceremony Rising Star Awards 2017 on a successful note recently.
Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama participated as the Chief Guest of the event while Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga attended as the Guest of Honour.
The event also drew many luminaries of the industry as well as distinguished guests from various spheres to the BMICH.
Commenting on the occasion, President Maithripala Sirisena noted, the tourism sector plays a key role in offering ample opportunities to the countrys youth at various levels.
Organizing professional competitions of this nature and scale will have a positive impact on drawing fresh blood into the tourism sector, which is one of the most rapidly growing disciplines in the country.
Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe extended his congratulatory wishes to the winners of the Rising Star Awards 2017.
In his message the Premier noted, It is commendable indeed to recognize and reward young talent between the ages of 18 to 27 years contributing to the success of the entire industry and the country, which has now earned a reputation for being one of the ' must visit' holiday destinations for 2017.
It is my wish to see other industries take a bold step to follow such initiatives which will undoubtedly inspire the youth, the future leaders of Sri Lanka.
Minister of Special Assignments Hon. Dr. Sarath Amunugama addressing the audience underscored the important role played by the tourism industry and its contribution towards the national economy.
I was informed by my colleague that 2.2 million tourists have arrived the country since 2016 to date.
The objective of the industry is to increase this number to 4 million in two years.
The tourist arrival declined considerably during the period where essential renovation was carried out at the Bandaranaike International Airports main runway.
Addressing the gathering President of The Hotels Association of Sri Lanka Sanathkwatte that they are the only industry which distributes 10% of our revenue amongst our employees in addition to the basic salary combined with benefits such as uniforms and free meals on duty.
Furthermore, the opportunity of interacting with people from diverse cultures across the globe stand as a unique attribute of the hotel industry.

SAITM will be neither abolished or nationalized  Health Minister

SAITM would not be abolished or nationalized but would function as a non-profit institution approved by the Higher Education Ministry, Co-Cabinet Spokesman, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne made this observation at the weekly cabinet media briefing held today at the Government Information Department.
Elaborating on this, Minister Senaratne said that SAITM would function as a non-profit institution which means that the surplus revenues of this institution will be used only for the improvement of the institution without distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders.
When a journalist inquired asked about Dr. Neville Fernandos response to the governments decision, Minister said that Dr. Neville Fernando has already agreed with this decision.
Responding to a question by a journalist asking whether any decision has been taken to transfer SAITM to SLIIT, Minister Senaratne said that not only the SLIIT, some other educational institutions has shown their willingness to take SAITM under their institutions.
Further responding to a query by a journalist who claimed that the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) doesnt agree with the governments decision on SAITM totally, Minister said that if the GMOA doesnt agree with governments decision totally they should suggest their own solution for the SAITM issue.

$129 bn in extreme weather losses last year
FRANCE: Extreme weather caused around $129 billion (111 billion euros) in economic losses last year, said a report Tuesday that warned the bill will keep climbing as climate change boosts droughts, storms and floods.
There was a 46-percent increase in weather disasters from 2010 to 2016, with 797 extreme events recorded last year, according to research published in The Lancet medical journal.
These resulted in $129 billion in overall economic losses -- a figure roughly matching the budget of Finland.
Losses were counted as damage to physical assets and did not include the economic value of deaths, injury or disease caused by extreme events.
An observed increase in weather disasters in recent years, the report said, cannot yet be unequivocally be attribute to climate change.
But the evidence might plausibly be interpreted as showing how climate change is changing the frequency and severity of these events, the authors wrote.
Climate scientists are loath to blame any particular weather event on global warming -- a phenomenon that needs to be monitored over decades.
But looking to the future, the authors are under no illusions that climate change will fuel the frequency and severity of tropical storms, droughts and flooding around the world.
The finances of poor countries are disproportionately hard hit, said the report compiled by experts from 24 academic institutions and inter-governmental bodies including the World Health Organization and World Meteorological Organization. Their losses from freak weather events were more than three times higher in 2016 than in 2010, and as a proportion of GDP, much greater than in rich nations.
In high-income countries, about half of economic losses were insured, compared to less than one percent in poor nations.
The researchers calculated that rising temperatures caused a loss of about 5.3 percent in labour productivity in outdoor workers since 2000.
Over the same period, the number of vulnerable people exposed to heatwaves -- putting them at risk of heatstroke, heart failure or dehydration -- increased by about 125 million.
The rising mercury also caused a near 10-percent rise since 1950 in the disease-spreading vectoral capacity of a mosquito bearing the potentially deadly dengue virus.
Climate change is expected to have an impact on crop production, with a one-degree-Celsius rise in temperatures associated with a six-percent decline in global wheat yields and a 10-percent decrease in rice grain yields, said a statement in The Lancet, warning of growing hunger.
The world's nations have pledged to limit average global warming caused by humankind's emission of fossil fuel gases, to two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) from pre-Industrial Revolution levels. We have already reached about 1 C.
US President Donald Trump has pulled his country out of the pact, though the withdrawal can only become effective in about four years.

About 300 state hospitals to be digitized by 2019
A total of 300 state hospitals will be digitized by 2019. The programme commenced at the Horana Base Hospital, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, in 2014, expired drugs worth Rs. 350 million were destroyed as there was no proper drug distribution system in the country at the time.
The minister was addressing the gathering after handing over seven buses (mobile dental units) and 50 computers to state hospitals during a ceremony at the Family Health Bureau in Colombo, recently.
However, state hospitals have now been networked and software has been introduced to ensure the proper distribution of drugs among state hospitals. Nothing can be done today without digitization and modern technology. The seven mobile dental units and 50 computers provided to state hospitals are worth Rs. 407 million, the minister said.There was a shortage of 44 to 79 drugs daily due to the non-availability of information on drug stocks online. However, after introducing the new software, all artificial drug shortage in the country ended, he added.

Agriculture is not wading but wallowing in the mud!
The President, ministers and other dignitaries were recently seen pushing ploughs in paddy fields wading knee deep through the mud and sipping kahata with jaggery for the cameras. Slogans such as lets cultivate every inch of cropland and Atu Kotu Purawamu (lets fill the garners and farmyards) were uttered and the latter was even printed on their tea shirts. Surprisingly, there was no reference to toxin free farming which the government was pushing so enthusiastically during the last two years. Has it died an inevitable natural death
Paddy farming keeps farmers poor
Be that as it may, as much as filling the garners, the need to fill the farmers purses is becoming increasingly important to keep them at their job. Increasing technical innovations and labour productivity are critically important. Is the government addressing these issues Whilst the country has strived relentlessly for over 70 years from the 1940s for attaining food security via rice self sufficiency, the matter of farmer income had been totally overlooked. Rice being a low income crop, the farmer had been kept poor, compelling him to supplement his income via off-farm employment. The bulk of the youth are skipping wading in the mud preferring other types of employment, a predominant one being three-wheel driving which brings on average, a net daily income no less than Rs 2,000. A comparable income could hardly be achieved from rice farming even in the high potential paddy districts as seen in the table.
Returns even from irrigated rice is only about Rs 200,000 per hectare. The average holding size is rarely that large, there being ill-legal fragmentation among children. By contrast, the returns in general are much smaller for some of the wet zone districts and in some seasons, can even be negative, largely due to high labour costs and low yields. Compare these paddy incomes for example, with that from other crops (Rs /ha): black gram: 51,302; cow-pea:36,985; kurakkan; 6,350; brinjal: 445,822; green chillies: 833,432; pumpkin: 127. Although the income from vegetables could be attractive, marketing risks and the extents cultivable, limit returns. For pulses, the main constraint has been poor yields and research over the last 50 years has hardly pushed them.
So, on the whole, revolutionary changes in farming is needed.
This demands new vision from both the technocrats and politicians being discussed later. Politicians wading in the mud is no answer, although that is where most of them belong! Much has been spoken about production planning to mitigate overproduction, storage facilities and value addition over decades, but little has hitherto happened to help the dry zone farmer to increase his income. Much needs to be done in the future to keep rice farmers at their task.
Rational land use
On the other hand, the pressure for land, particularly for housing and construction, especially in the urban and sub-urban areas in the wet zone, demands diversification of the paddy and other lands away from unproductive agriculture. Dilanka Gamalath, in an article titled Shelter vs Food  dangers facing agro-land refers to the Minister of Housing and Construction, Sajith Premadasa proposing relaxing regulations under the Agrarian Development Act of 2000, to enable some of the wet zone uncultivated paddy lands in the urban and suburban areas to be used for housing. That is a very sensible proposal contrary to Gamalaths concern that loss of agricultural land could affect food security. Of about 67,000 hectare of paddy lands in the Colombo district, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle and Kandy, nearly 17,000 ha remain uncultivated during both seasons and there is a need to use this land gainfully. Even in the unlikely scenario of the entire 67,000 hectare which is less than 10 percent of the total national rice cover and producing only about 5 percent of the countries rice being diversified, the impact on food security should be negligible. There is no argument that the lands close to townships in particular should be used for housing and industry and this requires the amendment of the outdated Act which prohibits diverting paddy lands even for other crops without authorisation of the District Secretary. But there has to be equitable distribution of lands for all human needs. Not only paddy, but other lands too need to be rationally diverted for such needs across the country. There is a housing backlog and some 100,000 housing units need to be built annually for which land has to be found. Food and shelter are both equally important. Apart from diverting for housing, some of these lands particularly those close to cities, if drained should be ideal for market gardening and protected agriculture (poly tunnels, greenhouses). Cattle farming is another alternative as most of these lands carry Brachiaria grass which is excellent fodder.
Gamalath also refers to a statement apparently made by the President during the launch of the food programme in Kekirawa. The President has supposedly said that one of the threats to agriculture is partitioning of coconut lands.
There is no argument that haphazard partitioning of coconut lands could affect coconut production. However, surprisingly, he has not been aware that over the last two decades or so, despite large scale fragmentation of coconut lands, the national coconut cover has fortunately increased from 390,000 to some 430,000 ha! This is a simple example of response to demand.
Coconut is fast turning out to be a high value crop. Not even the water from mature nuts is thrown away now from the mills; being value added and transformed to a sports drink much in demand in the U.S and Europe. And the scary oil is now the most widely used vegetable oil in the dietary and pharmaceutical industries, globally. So people will continue to grow coconuts, if in demand.
Food security and self sufficiency
Sri Lanka had achieved rice self-sufficiency by about 2010 through the excellent efforts of our rice breeders and other rice scientists pushing both yield and production by 700 percent. The yields jumped from 0.6 t/ha in the 1940s to 4.5t/ha today; the land extent under rice increased only by three fold. The research yields are almost double this figure, so that with proper adoption of technology cutting down the rice cover even by 20-30 percent should not be difficult, meaning the country should potentially be able to feed itself even without the wet zone paddy lands. Moreover, the population increase is only about 1 percent per annum and the future agro-technology advances should easily be able to match this with comparable productivity increases. Chinese rice research yields are already approaching 20 t/ha! The case for self-sufficiency is highly justified given the fact that world rice market is thin and appears to be growing thinner as importing countries continue to relentlessly pursue productivity enhancing policies comparatively more than the exporting countries. This is contrary to world wheat and maize markets because of regular large external supplies such as from U.S, Canada and Australia. There is no central international market for rice similar to the Chicago market for maize and wheat. On the other hand, food security is more a function of per capita income or purchasing power. Most of the highly developed countries such as Norway, Switzerland, Netherlands and Belgium have food self sufficiency ratios of about 50 percent, but this is no concern because of the very high per capita incomes.
Labour productivity and technology
Two of the most disconcerting factors in our country are low productivity and poor technological innovations in the agriculture sector. As for labour productivity, I cannot help quote an example I have seen more than once in the Kandy Municipality area, of two or three labourers cleaning a drain being supervised by a young lady!
We are in an age where labour is being widely replaced by machinery and equipment.
There are effective weeders, transplanters and seeders. How widely are they used What are the constraints to their wider use Is it purchasing power of the farmers These are matters that the government should address vigorously. I was impressed seeing the farmer in the picture, in the U.K, 80 years old, driving his tiller far smaller than a two wheel tractor. Can such machines be introduced here
That we are way behind adopting latest technologies is exemplified by the picture of the high density mango plantation being now practised for over a decade in many Asian countries. I havent seen a single such plantation locally. The closest is the variety Tom J.C a selection by a farmer who has grown it extensively in his farm in Datusenapura. The fruit is yellow in colour, tastes and keeps well, and now widely grown by many, but is over Rs 300/kg in the shop. We need not ourselves generate all the technology that we need. Much can be copied/adopted from outside.
As for our research and development (R&D) in the food crop sector, we can only be proud of the achievements of our past rice scientists who generated high yielding, fertilizer responsive and pest resistant varieties that has made the country self- sufficient. The R&D outputs in the other areas have altogether been meagre leading to small productivity increases. Our subsidiary food crop yields have hardly increased, except perhaps maize, but average yields of Bangladesh and China are over 6 t/ha, of India 5 t/ha and ours 3 t/ha! Our green chilli yields are only 4 t/ha as against that of China, 22 t/ha! The Department of Agricultures (DOAs) R & D has drastically deteriorated. There is just one top rice breeder now as against six in the hay days of the 1970s, and this officer is to retire in a few months.
The same is true of soil scientists, there being just one at the PhD level as against 6 in the 1970s, if my memory is right. Sadly, there has been little or no training and succession planning! This had been pointed out in an exhaustive review of the DOA in 2009 of which not one word has been implemented! Sadly the DOA has lost its focus and priorities, being more engaged in putting up Helabojun sales points and the likes to keep the politicians happy!
Agriculture is now not wading but wallowing in the mud!!

Another 15,000 teachers to be recruited:Akila
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said that plans are afoot to recruit 15,000 teachers in the next few months to ease the teacher shortage. The recruitment of teachers to the College of Education will also be increased to 10,000 in the near future.
This will help to carry out the 13-Year Compulsory Education Programme (CEP) to be implemented at 42 National schools islandwide, he said.
The new system will allow the students, who do not pass the GCE Ordinary Level to proceed to the Advanced Level, to pursue vocational studies to succeed in future, the Minister said.
The Minister was speaking at the annual prize giving ceremony of Ananda Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo yesterday. In order to maintain a developed education system, the scope of the syllabus should be reduced and pressure faced by the children minimised.We are formulating a policy for that, Minister Kariyawasam said.
Principals and teachers should always be practical. Children should be given freedom to enjoy their childhood.
Then only can they achieve better results in schools and other activities, the Minister added.
All principals and teachers should think of the students as their children which will reduce many problems. Especially, they should think about the mental stability of children. Due to the injustice caused to the girl in Kekirawa, we will provide her with a national school and a provide a monthly allowance of Rs.3000 to help her continue her studies, Minister Kariyawasam said.

Australia Senate President Stephen Parry to resign

Australian Senate President Stephen Parry has said he will resign after confirming he is a UK dual citizen.
Parry said in a statement that he believes he was wrongly elected because of his status.
On Friday, the High Court of Australia ruled that five politicians were invalidly elected under the constitution because they held dual citizenship.
Parry inherited British citizenship from his father.
The senior government figure said he was making the announcement with "a heavy heart" after receiving confirmation from the British Home Office.
Parry's role as Senate president is to preside over Australia's upper house, mirroring the role of the speaker in the lower House of Representatives.
A replacement for Parry will be chosen through a recount of votes from last year's election. It is likely to be another member of the Liberals, the senior party in the governing coalition.
He becomes the third government member to lose his job over the saga, following the disqualifications of Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and Regional Development Minister Fiona Nash.
Joyce and Nash were members of the Nationals, the junior coalition partner.

Bangladesh to probe South Africa debacle
DHAKA Oct31, 2017: Bangladeshs cricket board said Tuesday it would launch an investigation into its humiliating drubbing during a recent tour of South Africa in one of its worst performances on record.
Bangladesh lost every match in all three formats, with David Miller smashing the fastest century in Twenty20 history off just 35 balls from the hapless visitors.
Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hasan said the players, managers and coaching staff would be questioned over the woeful showing.
The overall performance was very bad. Of course, we have some questions, Hasan told reporters in Dhaka.
We have to know if there were other problems. We all know Bangladesh can lose games, but we cannot accept the way they lost them. Their bowlers, who were lacklustre throughout the tour, were not all to blame as the batsmen could not do anything even on a flat wicket, Hasan said.
Bangladesh only attained Test status in 2000, and rank ninth on the international ladder, but have enjoyed some recent wins at home over Australia, Sri Lanka and England.
But their drubbing abroad has highlighted the bigger challenge for the cricket minnows, Hasan said.
Bangladesh are expected to host Sri Lanka in January in their next series, before travelling to the West Indies in February.

Beaten O'Sullivan compares Chinese teen to Hendry
Shanghai: British legend Ronnie O'Sullivan predicted a stellar future for teenager Yan Bingtao after he was stunned by the Chinese prodigy in the first round of the International Championship. O'Sullivan, who triumphed at the English Open just over a week ago, failed to pot a ball in the last four frames as he was hammered 6-1 by the 17-year-old in Daqing, northeast China.
"Yan played fantastically well, maybe only Stephen Hendry and John Higgins have played that well against me before," the 41-year-old O'Sullivan told worldsnooker.com, referring to the Scottish greats who have 11 world titles between them.
"I played well in Barnsley and I feel comfortable with my game, I just got outplayed today.
"I didn't do that much wrong apart from missing a couple of balls." It was the most significant victory of the 53-ranked Yan's fledgling career, and five-time world champion O'Sullivan added: "If Yan plays like that he'll be very difficult to beat in this tournament, if he can play like that consistently he'll win a lot of tournaments.
"He has an all-round game, a good temperament and he carries himself well. He has presence around the table and to be a champion you need to portray that image. "All the great players won tournaments when they were 17 or 18 so if he's going to be a great player then he'll win one soon."
O'Sullivan was allowed to wear trainers - as he was at the English Open in Barnsley - because of an ankle injury, but added: "My foot is ok, I feel comfortable in these trainers, so I've no excuses." AFP

Big miracles!
The blue whale is the most massive animal to have ever lived. A full-grown blue whale is larger than the largest dinosaur, larger than the prehistoric mammoths and mastodons. Ranging from 25 to 28 metres long, an adult blue whale is about the size of three school buses lined up in a row. Its heart weighs as much as a drum full of oil. Its tongue can weigh as much as an elephant.
Its hard to fathom just how big that is. But flying above the Indian Ocean in a tiny jet, watching these animals swim across its blue surface, you start to get a sense. F-Airways, a subsidiary of the real estate group Fairway Holdings, has started offering commercial flights in three and five-seater Cessna jets to see the blue whales that feed off the coast of Sri Lanka.
Its a totally different perspective, said marine researcher Howard Martenstyn on a recent afternoon at the Koggala Airforce Base, where the fleet of Cessnas are stationed.
You can really say, My God, look how long this animal is, he added.
Sri Lankanblue whales
Martenstyn said the whales that gather around Sri Lanka are actually a subspecies of the blue whale, called pygmy blue whales. Their name is a bit of a misnomer; the whales are only a couple metres shorter than their larger cousins.
They can be seen off the coast of Sri Lanka all year round, their numbers peaking in April and decreasing slightly in June and July. The whales like to gather in the waters around submarine canyons, which are rich in marine life like krill, tiny crustaceans that make up the base of their diet.
Its ironic that these massive creatures reach their full size by eating something so small. They manage it by eating massive amounts: The U.S. Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that blue whales can eat over 3.5 tonnes of krill during their peak feeding season.
To eat, the whales take big gulps of krill and filter them out through bone plates called baleen. Its estimated that they can eat half a million calories in a single mouthful.
One of the best places to see blue whales feeding is off the coast of Mirissa. The town, once a tiny fishing community on Sri Lankas south coast, has since transformed into a major tourist destination, helped in part by its numerous blue whale watching tour operators.
But Sanjaya Adikari, the Chief Operating Officer of F-Airways, hopes that his companys air-based model could make Koggala a new hub for blue whale watching.
Were giving another option, he said at the Koggala airport last week. From take-off, its just six or seven minutes to whale territory, he said.
In addition, theres rough seas during the Southwest monsoon, which keeps people from whale watching, he said. Were planning to operate year-round, no offseason.
In August you actually see a lot of whales, Martenstyn, the whale researcher, added. Fishermen tell you that, but boats dont go out because of the monsoon.
Adikari said he plans to have his pilots record GPS data on whale sightings on each tour, which could then be made available to scientists like Martenstyn.
While some is known about the whales, like the fact that they can live to be over 90 years old, Martenstyn says a lot of gaps in knowledge remain.
Nobody knows the exact migratory patterns of Sri Lankas blue whales, for example. Martenstyn said he hopes more visibility could help shed light on the remaining mysteries.
The greatest showon earth
Last week, the seas were calm and so were the skies. A Cessna jet took off from the Koggala airstrip with a group of three reporters to go look for blue whales off the coast.
The beaches of Koggala, Weligama, and Mirissa disappeared below as the plane flew towards open waters. On the horizon, massive shipping tankers plied the trade routes between the Persian Gulf and the Malacca Strait.
Its in the space between that blue whales feed, diving for krill and surfacing for air.
Four sets of eyes scanned the water for signs of life. Suddenly, a photographer in the back of the plane yelped, and the pilot banked hard and to the left.
Down below was a massive whale, splayed out on the sunlit sea. It sprayed a fountain of water into the air, and then slowly began arching its back to dive.
As the plane finished its tight circle, the whale flipped its tail into the air, and disappeared into the deep.
Blue whales are largely solitary animals, coming together in groups of two or three to feed. They dive between 300 and 500 metres to gulp up krill.
The pilot kept scanning the ocean in lazy circles, looking to see if the first whale was alone. Sure enough, another whale appeared on the surface, giving away its location with a huge burst of its blowhole.
These whales were moving slowly, but they can travel quickly when they want to. Theyve been recorded while traveling at bursts of 45 kilometres per hour. The whale made a slow dive into the water below.
The plane circled the feeding grounds for about half an hour, watching the whales surface and descend again.
As the pilot made a course towards shore, a pod of about 30 dolphins leapt from the water below, a final farewell to the onlookers.
Howard Martenstyn calls Sri Lanka the greatest cetacean show on earth. Cetaceans, or the class of marine mammals that include whales, dolphins, and porpoises, are plentiful in Sri Lankas waters.
Although the blue whale is the most prominent, marine mammal lovers can also see sperm whales, orcas, and spinner dolphins off the coast of the island.
The ocean around Sri Lanka is like no other Martenstyn writes in his book Out of the Blue.
Sri Lankas location, marine topography and double-monsoon weather system make it an unusually hospital location for marine mammals of many species, he says.
You can watch the cetacean show from a boat, the traditional venue, or you can now watch from a plane.
F-Airways charges about US $100 per person for their air tours. They last between 45 minutes and an hour.
Flying in the small plane can be a scary experience. One reporter almost lost her lunch on a recent flight. But to be soaring above the largest animals on earth: you have to see it to believe it.

The area which comes under the purview of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha will be sub-divided into three areas such as Ambagamuwa, Norwood and Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabhas while the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha division will be sub-divided into three areas such as Nuwara Eliya, Agarapathana and Kotawila Pradeshiya Sabhas.
Minister Ganesan pointed out that the earlier two Pradeshiya Sabhas which struggled to deliver services to 225,000 people each can now easily cope with each Pradeshiya Sabha covering a population of 50,000.

Chinese star trio fined for rare revolt
Shanghai: Table tennis authorities hit world number one Ma Long and two other Chinese stars with $20,000 fines Tuesday but stopped short of suspending them after they quit a tournament in protest at their coach's removal. The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) said that Ma, Fan Zhendong and Xu Xin -- the three top-ranked players in the world -- "damaged the reputation of the ITTF" and "let down the global fans at the China Open".
But the ITTF said in a statement that it had resisted a one-month ban after the trio promised there would be no repeat in future and explained why they had failed to turn up for their round-of-16 matches in Chengdu, southwestern China, in June.
"The trio did not provide the ITTF or the organising committee any immediate reason why they did not turn up for their matches," the ITTF said.
"However, due to the players' explanations, both their own and CTTA's assurances that such behaviour will not be repeated, the three players will not receive any suspension and will be fined $20,000 each." AFP

Hats off to gentleman police officer
It is deplorable to witness and to hear specially through the media, how the Police personnel are being undermined to a greater extent today. It is really unwarrantable to grade every officer in the Police Dept., when there are so many who possess human values to a greater length.
It is a saddening fact, that they are not being highlighted in their good work and values in the same way, when the wrongdoers are being repeatedly highlighted. This impact gives a biased reflection to the minds of the society of the Police personnel.
I recently (10.21.2017) happened to witness the Commemoration of International Senior Citizens Day representing our elders society with other members, organised by the Homagama Pradeshiya Bala Mandalaya in a most exclusive manner, at Homagama Central College. There were few speakers including some politicians, and some distinguished invitees were also present to grace the occasion. Among them was this gentleman, Mr. Herath who took great care and interest over this episode, and was requested to deliver a speech.
His speech was tremendously impressive and he really displayed his impeccability. For a moment I was at a loss to realize that he was a Police Officer, who delivered a lengthy speech in a limited time frame. Congregation was overjoyed. It did not take much time for me to realize, what a humble, caring and loving man he is, with high level of human qualities. He emphasized in his speech the value of the elders, mothers, and how he valued this occasion, and also made everyone happy by singing songs etc. I really appreciate his wonderful speech sparing his valuable time, for the most needed Senior Citizens.
A big thank you, Sir, we need more and more officers like you to revamp your Department.

COMBANK honoured  with two titles at  ACES Awards 2017
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon was named among the Top Companies in Asia and the Top Green Companies in Asia at the 2017 Asia Corporate Excellence & Sustainability (ACES) Awards that honour and showcase Asias finest and most responsible corporate leaders.
The Bank was the only financial institution in Sri Lanka to be ranked among the Top Companies in Asia at these awards.
The Top Companies in Asia selection is based on revenues and the companys overall globalisation, growth rate, market size, innovativeness, international footprint, brand strength, team quality and experience, outstanding leadership ability and overall performance.
The award for Top Green Companies in Asia honours companies that run their business operations with minimal negative impact on the environment, community, and society, while maintaining a profit.
The candidates that qualified for these prestigious awards were judged on a leadership matrix comprising spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation and sustainability, responsible practice, brand equity and revenue, and a sustainability matrix that encompassed products and innovation, leadership value, ethical compliance, diversity and inclusion and community empowerment.
The Commercial Bank of Ceylons position in the Top Green Companies in Asia category can be attributed to the Banks stringent evaluation of credit proposals to gauge their impact on the environment and the sustainability of the projects, support to sustainable energy projects of its clients through lending, and for its own efforts in making its operations more environment friendly.
Commercial Bank adopts a Social and Environmental Management System (SEMS) to assess and manage social and environmental risks in a strategic and systematic manner. Procedures and work flows within the framework of SEMS ensure that the Banks lending is to environmentally sustainable, socially acceptable and economically viable projects.
The Banks Green Development Loans, the installation of solar power systems at branches, its initiatives to migrate customers to digital platforms, and its investments in automated technology that minimise the use of paper are a few of its environment- friendly efforts.
Commenting on the two titles conferred on the Bank at the awards ceremony at the Intercontinental Hotel, Singapore, recently, the Banks Managing Director Jegan Durairatnam said: These awards are a testament that Commercial Bank is not only a financial industry leader in Sri Lanka, but is also a leader in sustainable and planet-friendly business. Empowering our customers to go Green is an important element in our product development.
The ACES Awards are organised by the MORS Group whose vision statement is championing an Asia that is flourishing, resilient, sustainable, and united. The event attended by the Bank saw a total of 44 ACES awards presented to winners from 185 entries across 11 Asian countries.
All entries were voluntarily submitted to a management process audit in order to be eligible to contest.
The awards value and recognise services and achievements of businesses large and small, national and international, for their esteemed contributions to their communities and the world.

## Title: Coronation of XI Jinping
## Supertitle:

Coronation of XI Jinping
Chinas Communist Party formally elevated President Xi Jinping to the same status as party legends Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday, writing his name into its constitution and setting the nations leader up for an extended stay in power.
The move will make Xi the most powerful Chinese leader in decades, with ambitions to tighten party control over society and make his country a superpower on the world stage.
The unanimous vote to enshrine Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in a New Era in the constitution came on the final day of the week-long 19th Party Congress, a gathering of the party elite held once every five years in the imposing and cavernous Great Hall of the People on the western side of Beijings Tiananmen Square.
There is no Little Red Book of pithy quotations as there was under Mao, but instead a mightier, drier tome of his speeches on The Governance of China. Nevertheless, Xis ideas will now become compulsory learning for Chinese students from primary schools through universities.
On Wednesday, more evidence of Xis power will emerge when he introduces the other members of the Communist Partys top leadership, the Politburo Standing Committee, to the media. Experts say it is unlikely that a clear successor will emerge or be anointed, leaving Xis preeminent position free of an obvious challenge.
The Party Congress effectively marks the start of Xis second five-year-term as party general secretary. But the chances are now higher that this will not be his last  or at least that he will remain the most powerful person in China beyond 2022.
The amendment of the party constitution effectively confirms Xi Jinpings aspiration to be the Mao Zedong of the 21st Century  that means a top leader with no constraints on tenure or retirement age, said Willy Wo-Lap Lam, a political expert at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
The inclusion of Xis name in the partys document makes him only the third Chinese leader to be so honoured, with his ideology joining Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as a guide to action.
Chinas Communist Party imposed a system of collective leadership after the death of Mao. It was a party scarred by the madness, cruelty and famine that one man had imposed through disastrous policies, notably the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution.
As a result, Xis two predecessors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, ruled through consensus  as the first among equals at the top of the ladder  and were limited to two terms in power.
Now the party is moving back in the other direction.
Xis power is not unlimited, and many of his key policy measures reflect ideas adopted by the party before he took power. Yet the past week has seen an explosion of sycophancy toward Chinas leader, after his mammoth 3 1/2- hour speech kicked off proceedings last Wednesday. This is a personal style of rule, much like Vladimir Putins in Russia.
Throughout the week, senior officials lined up, one after the other, to laud what they described as Xis profound, courageous, thrilling, insightful masterpiece of a speech that shone the light of Marxist Truth and moved some of them from the bottom of their hearts.
In retrospect, it was an overwhelming assertion of authority to a degree unseen since Mao, said Franois Godement, director of the China-Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
Xi would still have to overcome significant obstacles if he wants to remain in power beyond the next party congress in 2022  including a convention that officials retire if they are 68 or older, said Yanmei Xie, a China policy expert at Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing. By that time, Xi will be 69.
Retaining power behind the scenes
There had been speculation that Xi would break from previous practice by asking Wang Qishan, his right-hand man and powerful head of the anti-corruption authority, to stay on for another five years. Yet the 69-year-old Wangs name does not appear on a new list of Central Committee members, implying that the retirement convention remains in place, at least for now.
He would also have to amend the constitution if he wanted a third term as president  or appoint a loyal follower to the top job while retaining power behind the scenes, as Putin did in Russia in 2008.
Nevertheless, the fact that Xis name figures in the constitution puts him on a par with the partys immortals, Mao and Deng, who had no term limits and did not retire, said Xie. And the drumbeat of propaganda about loyalty to his leadership  combined with the constant threat of an unforgiving anti-corruption campaign that has taken down several powerful rivals  makes it more difficult for anyone who dares challenge him.
The introduction of Xi Thought makes the question of succession while Xi is alive a moot issue, said Bill Bishop, publisher of the Sinocism newsletter. So long as Xi has not met Marx, he is the man with an eponymous theory in the party constitution, so no one will have more authority than him  no matter what title Xi holds, Bishop said.
Xi Jinping Thought embodies several important principles, experts said: primarily that the party is in control of every aspect of life in China, from the economy to the Internet, from politics to culture and religion. The party must be more disciplined, and more responsive to peoples needs, but its leadership must not be questioned.
Xi highlighted what he called the principal contradiction in modern China, between unbalanced and unequal development and peoples needs for a better life.
No more blind pursuit of economic growth at all costs, he implied, but a focus also on the issues that concern people the most, including the need to curb pollution and provide better education and health care.
True global superpower
Meanwhile, the market will continue to play an important role in the economy, but the role of the party, and key state-owned enterprises, will remain supreme. But the other big message is that China is on a path to become a true global superpower  very much on its own terms.
Under his reign, there is no more hope of convergence, said Godement. He referred to the idea that China would become more open, more ruled by law and more democratic as it became wealthier, that its interests and political system would ultimately converge with those of the West.
The idea of political reform in a Western sense is now firmly out the window: Indeed, Chinese state media no longer hides its contempt for the political and economic systems of the West.
China, Xi said last week, is blazing a new trail for other developing countries to follow.
Xis message promotes a nationalist, assertive China, with a much stronger military, a country that he says will not threaten the world but will resolutely defend its interests.
By the middle of this century or before, China aims to close the gap economically and militarily with the United States and become the ultimate arbiter in the Asia-Pacific region, Lam said.
If Maos era was one of revolution and nation-building and Dengs was one of reform and opening that set China on the path to becoming a global economic power, Xis era perhaps is one of control and nationalism, of realizing what he calls the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.
Dengs influence on the course of Chinese history was massive, but his power was wielded less explicitly, often from a position behind the scenes. As a result, his theory on socialism with Chinese characteristics was not formally incorporated into the party constitution until after his death.
Former leader Jiangs ideological contribution is recognized in the document as the Theory of Three Represents, as is Hus Scientific Outlook on Development, but neither man is mentioned by name. - Washington Post

DIPLOMATIC CORPS BOYCOTT CEREMONY
Royal Ceylon Navy ensign fluttered bravely in Trinco on October 15, 1967 followed by Katunayake two weeks later when Royal Air Force Ensign was lowered and to the strains of Namo namo maatha Royal Ceylon Air Force ensign was hoisted in its place.
Strengthening the bonds between the two nations, United Kingdom handed back Trinco base after 156 years of British domination. The base was handed over on October 15, 1967, exactly 50 years ago at a very impressive ceremony at Royal Navy Football grounds lowering of white ensign of British Navy and Royal Ceylon Navy Ensign with the Lion Flag at the top left hand corner being hoisted gradually to the strains of Namo Namo Maatha played by Royal Ceylon Navy Band and steady hand clapping by the large crowd present. Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike made a short speech.
Gaining independence from Britain in 1948, the Dominion of Ceylon marked the beginning of self-rule. Ceylon was a superficially peaceful land when the colonial masters handed over it to the local politicians in 1948. The hastily designed United National Party was duly put in office after parliamentary elections under a British-made Constitution. A Defence treaty was signed by D S Senanayake, the first Prime Minister with Britain that gave the British a base for Royal Navy at Trincomalee, an airfield at Katunayake for Royal Air Force, with training control of the Ceylonese Army, which was manned by British military officers.
The UNP governments continued with the defense treaty with the British Administration that spared the country the cost of maintaining a large military establishment. The British Royal Air Force and Royal Navy had bases in Katunayake and Trincomalee respectively. National Defense consumed less than four percent of the state budget, compelling the governments of DS Senanayake, son Dudley and Sir John Kotalawala to encourage their continued presence in a so-called independent and sovereign state.
The SLFP, the main opposition was critical of UNPs pro-western stand. It alleged that the Independence arranged in 1948 was a mock and that actual freedom could only be achieved by breaking all ties with the English monarchy. The state authority, inheritors of the white masters customs, continued on the same lines without much disruption.
Trinco Naval Base taken over
It was a combined operation by the Royal Navy and Royal Ceylon Navy for the official handing over. Two very smart guards were presented by the two navies during ceremony. Dressed smartly was the acting British High Commissioner, Crosthwaite, who represented the UK government at the ceremony speaking said, it was with pride with the achievements of the Royal Navy we see this base transferred today as a place in which the Royal Ceylon Navy can develop to make in its twin a fitting contribution to the security and well-being of Ceylon.
A special train left Colombo with Parliamentarians, government officials and other dignitaries, while Prime Minister Bandaranaike flew with eight ministers. After about five months of consistent drought there was a welcome shower of rain in the early hours, however it did not rain during the ceremony.
PM in his speech said, this marks another milestone in the long and not uninteresting history of Trincomalee relationship. It was somewhat chequered history but on the whole it can be considered a happy one. When my government took office an year ago, in pursuance of our foreign policy, we requested the British Government to handover the base to us. This step was not taken in a spirit of hostility. Our foreign policy is based on friendship with all nations and non-alignment with any of the power blocs and our request to Britain to handover the base was to give effect to this policy.
Katunayake ceremony
Two weeks later, celebrations moved from East to West. At a simple but historic ceremony on November 1, 1957, Katunayake the last of the British bases in Ceylon, was handed over to Ceylon at the auspicious hour 9.53 a. m., another landmark in the history of the country was achieved.
The Royal Ceylon Air Force band played the first six bars of God save the Queen and the Royal Air Force Ensign was lowered. Then to the strains of Namo namo maatha Royal Ceylon Air Force ensign was hoisted in its place. While this impressive ceremony was in progress inside the air base outside on Negombo road at the entrance to the base three airmen of the Royal Ceylon Air Force were busy replacing the massive RAF Katunayake board with a new boardthat of the Royal Ceylon Air Force(RCyAF).
Guards of Honour, which was presented both by the RAF and the RCyAF were first inspected by the acting High Commissioner, T L Crosthwaite and later by Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike. The HC speaking said, it was their hope that full advantage of this opportunity would be taken to profit by the continued example and knowledge RAF would provide.
PM in a short speech said, that with the handing over of the base at Katunayake, another landmark in the history of the country had been achieved, our independence was now complete. As you are aware, the UK throughout its connection with its dependent territories, treated their anxiety to conduct their own affairs with understanding and sympathy. When the history of this country records itself I feel certain that one of the outstanding factors will be dignity, cordiality, friendship and good grace with which the UK handed back the control of its depended territories to the people who ruled them earlier. The Premier said the method of handing over of the two bases in Ceylon provided that things could be done in an atmosphere of dignity and friendship.
In Afghanistan
The latest of similar events in the history was recorded when, in October 2014, British troops ended their combat operations in Afghanistan as they and U.S. Marines handed over two huge adjacent bases to the Afghan military, 13 years after a U.S.-led invasion launched the long and costly war against the Taliban. At the U.S. Camp Leatherneck and Britains Camp Bastion, which lie next to each other in the southwestern province of Helmand, troops lowered the American and British flags for the final time and folded them away. About ten years before this an important step was taken in the relationship between Ceylon and Britain when Ceylon obtained dominion status and a position of equality among the Commonwealth nations.
However, notable absentees at the ceremony were the members of the diplomatic corps. Did they boycott If so why

Driving positive employee  engagement through sports
Employee engagement is a vital element in creating a successful corporate culture. Virtusa, the largest IT services exporter in Sri Lanka with a workforce of nearly 3,000 IT professionals, has managed to create a strong culture of camaraderie through sports and games.
Captain of the winning team - Pramod ChamalkaAkila Galappaththi
Be it through a game of table tennis or pool at the office or outdoor sports activities, the company has found a way to create highly engaged and happy employees. The recently held Canekeratne Trophy cricket tournament brought everyone in the organization together. Heres a deeper delve into their unique execution.
On equal footing
Sports is a great equalizer, says Chandi Dharmaratne, senior director, Human Resources at Virtusa. It puts everyone on the same playing field regardless of designation.
She explains that there are limits to which day-to-day teamwork can engage people and bring them together as a closely-knit team. Hence the need for a change of setting to one with a more casual atmosphere.
We have always thought out of the box when it comes to employee engagement. As a tech company, we went beyond just a cricket tournament and included an additional social aspect utilizing our internal social network Yammer that really engaged our employees.
Chandi explained how an internal voting system was set up on Yammer to choose the Most Popular Team and how each team could campaign for votes. This led to campaigning on a global scale, across the companys geographies and offices with employees from all levels interacting with each other resulting in a record level of Yammer usage in Virtusas history.
Everyone was engaged and invested in the outcome of the vote, she adds.
This inclusion of a social aspect to the sports event garnered greater interest from everyone as well as expanded it from a single day event to one that kept them engaged for weeks. It also opened lines of communications across departments as well as between employees and the management. It even eliminated the need for any athletic prowess and made it simply about enthusiasm and communication  everyone was truly on equal footing.
Nusky Lafeer, consultant  Technology Services, is a member of the team voted the Most Popular at the conclusion of the Yammer campaign. When the likes count started to go above 1,500+, the competition got very serious, said a very amused Nusky.
The team went through the entire global headcount report and started talking to individuals to be a part of the Yammer campaign. Virtusans from other geos like USA and Germany wished us luck for the tournament and they were really happy to be a part of choosing the most popular team," Nusky added.
Everyone in the team was so excited to the point that some showed up for work even on weekends to keep our lead steady, he reminisced.
Associate consultant Akila Galappaththis team lost in the semi-finals but she recalls that they had so much fun that the outcome did not matter to them. We were excited from the beginning. Apart from regular practice, we spent a lot of time creating the perfect logo and name for our team too, noted a very joyful Akila.
We were beginners when we started the tournament but the excitement of the whole event and everything leading up to it made us feel like professionals. We were very happy about each others performance and it was great team work and so much fun, Akila added.
Creating an internal culture that employees know and communicate with each other can have major benefits to a company. Virtusa has long been a company with an eye on the future and delivering long term results is part of its DNA.
Engaging offline
After weeks of creating anticipation and excitement, the day of the tournament was one of camaraderie and fun attended by players and non-players alike. The online engagement had successfully translated offline, as everyone was already excited about their favourite team winning the actual tournament long before the first ball was bowled.
The Runners Up position was secured by the team which represented Virtusas Facilities staff. Gihan Sameera Fernando captained the team. As the Facilities Team, we extend our services to the whole of Virtusa. Therefore, we received immense support and encouragement from everyone across the company. It was exciting to see how they cheered for us all the way from Yammer to the field, he said.
Nusky Lafeer
Our main goal was to make the Facilities Team proud. This achievement is a result of the dedication and commitment of each member of the team, added a visibly proud Gihan, who also won the Best Batsman award.
The tournament saw many exciting moments but none more so than the champions trophy being awarded to the winning team that ultimately made the crowd erupt in cheers. In the end, regardless of who won, each person at the field that day revelled in the victory.
Winning the Canekeratne Trophy was a proud and unforgettable moment for us, said an ecstatic senior consultant Pramod Chamalka Sendanayake who captained the winning team. Leading the team to beat 41 others was not an easy task recalled an exhausted Pramod, reminiscing the long road to victory. He attributes the win to his teams dedication, hard work and team spirit. We were in good form as everyone was dedicated and took part in regular practice sessions. Our winning attitude and determination got us here, he said.
He went on to add that special occasions like these are a wonderful opportunity for team building, interacting closely with colleagues and taking a break from the regular work environment.

Farah splits with long-time coach Salazar
London: British long-distance running star Mo Farah will no longer work with long-time coach Alberto Salazar but has denied the split is related to doping allegations surrounding the Oregon-based guru, it was reported on Monday.
In an interview with The Sun newspaper, Farah, the four-time Olympic champion over 10,000m and 5,000m, said he was ending his association with Salazar because of a move back to Britain.
The 34-year-old Somalia-born star began training with Salazar in 2011 at his Oregon Project camp in Portland, and won his first world title the same year in the 5,000m at the Daegu World Championships.
Salazar's training base however has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the United States Anti-Doping Agency.
A leaked USADA report this year asserted that Salazar had likely violated drug protocols, later denied by the coach.
Farah, who has repeatedly denied involvement in doping, told The Sun the allegations involving Salazar were not behind his decision.
"I'm not leaving the Nike Oregon Project and Alberto Salazar because of the doping allegations," he told the paper.
"This situation has been going on for over two years, if I was going to leave because of that I would have done.
"As I've always said, I am firm believer in clean sport and I strongly believe that anyone who breaks the rules should be punished.
"If Alberto had crossed the line I would be out the door but USADA (US Anti Doping) has not charged him with anything. If I had ever had any reason to doubt Alberto, I would not have stood by him all this time."
Farah, who has retired from track running to concentrate on the marathon, said family reasons had driven the move.
"I'm leaving simply because my family and I are moving back to London," he said.
"We all loved spending our summer here and Tania and I realised how much we have missed spending time with our friends and family - and the kids are so happy here, too.
"We want the kids to grow up in the UK. It's the right thing to do for my family. But both Nike Oregon Project and Alberto are based in the USA, so it just would not be possible to continue our relationship from London." AFP

First among the Anandians
Ananda College is celebrating its 131st anniversary on first of November 2017. It is quite evident that the contributions made by Anandians were quite remarkable in many disciplines .You refer anything about victory against terrorism , sports, literature ,science, Arts to politics you could not ignore Anandians with their achievements. What was the success story of Ananda College This is all about making -up a sensitive person with love, affection and passion towards to the nation.
History of Ananda College
An educational organization identified as the Buddhist Theosophical Society was formed in Sri Lanka under the leadership of Colonel Henry Steele Olcott who was a founder member of the Theosophical Society of New York. The names of Ananda College and Henry Steel Olcott always go together in Sri Lankan literature. Olcott was born on August 2, 1832, in Orange, New Jersey. After an early career in agricultural science and journalism, he served during the Civil War as a military investigator of fraud and corruption.
This was followed by a career in law, which he later combined with journalism, reporting on spiritual phenomena. Olcott is especially admired for his work among the Buddhists of Sri Lanka, Burma, and Japan, helping them realize the essential value of their own heritage (that is, one of the essences which is inculcated by Ananda throughout the last 131 years. The patriotic love for the country!) . The administrative skill and public activities throughout the world were largely responsible for the society's growth and organizational success.
The Buddhist Theosophical Society opened a number of schools in different parts of Sri Lanka for the higher education of Buddhist children.In 1886 the first of those schools was opened on a modest scale with 37 students in a private house in Colombo. Later this school was named Ananda College after Arahant Ananda, the most devoted disciple of the Buddha. Ananda College has its memorable events in the school's history. One was the visit of Asia's first Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, on November 10 ,1922, as chief guest at the annual prize giving. He declared on that occasion: I acknowledge that the life of Ananda is its humility and unassuming nature.
First student at Ananda
It is interesting to discuss about the first student of Ananda College names as Jinarajadasa. He was born on 16 December 1875 and year 1889 was one of the remarkable year for young Jinarajadasa. This is the year, when Charles Webster Leadbeater, the first principal of Ananda College was asked by A.P. Sinnett (English author and theosophist) to come back to England to tutor his son, Leadbeater agreed and also brought one of his pupils, Jinarajadasa, to England with him. Jinarajadasa went to St John's College, Cambridge where he studied oriental languages and after four years graduated in the Oriental Languages Tripos. He then came back to Ceylon and became the vice principal of Ananda College in Colombo. Jinarajadasa returned to Europe, to study at the University of Pavia, Italy. Hereafter this Old Anandian has become proficient in Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese. Jinarajadasa has enormous contribution to world in terms of literature, knowledge and Wisdom. The story and some life events of this intellectual is always worth to study .See following remarks by Surendra Narayan,
C. Jinarajadasa (C. J.) was the fourth international president of the Theosophical Society from 1945 to 1953. He was born and raised in Sri Lanka until he came into contact with his brother from a past life (said by some to be Bishop C. W. Leadbeater), who took him away from Sri Lanka to guide and help him to grow spiritually and become a dedicated worker for the Theosophical Society.
As many know, the TS was founded by Colonel H. S. Olcott and H. P. Blavatsky, but the inner founders were two Masters of the Wisdom, with one of whom, as C. Jinarajadasa mentions, he had bonds of love and gratitude that extended from past lives and whom he regarded as an incarnation of love and power.Since my parents were members of the Theosophical Society, I invariably accompanied them as a child and later in my college years to the annual conventions of the Theosophical Society at Adyar and Varanasi. There I used to observe and respectfully admire C. J. as a charming leader of the Society. He once came to north India on a lecture tour and wanted a young theosophist who knew Hindi (the language of that area) to accompany him. My eldest brother volunteered and, to his great delight, was chosen by C. J. for that glorious job. Thereafter, when C. J. visited our hometown, he readily accepted my father's invitation to come to our home for lunch. I felt thrilled to be so near him, for he was to me an embodiment of grace and goodwill. He seemed to radiate uplifting currents of bliss and benediction. C. J. was a messenger of love and beauty and carried that message all his life through his writings and lecture tours around the world. He was a rich linguist and, through his fluency in Spanish and Portuguese, greatly expanded theosophical work in South and Central America. Apart from being a linguist, an international lecturer, and a beacon for the TS and many young people, C. J. was also a poet. So I would like to end with one of his beautiful poems, which truly delineates his outlook on life:
Word that is true and voice that is kind,Thought that is just from a selfless mind;Help that is swift and hurt that is spared,Grief that is hid and joy that is shared.These be the flowers that I cull this day,Smiling at eve in thy hands to lay. 
(Source : Narayan, Surendra. C. Jinarajadasa. Quest 93.6 (November-December 2005):228-229.)
As scholar, lecturer Jinarajadasa was awarded the Subba Row Medal for his contribution to Theosophical literature. He has immensely contributed for exciting domain of knowledge with many publications on areas such as Theology, philosophy, literature, art and science.
The story of Jinarajadasa, first student of Ananda college need to be read by all Sri Lankans to study about a great human being with love ,affection and passion towards to world. We need to motivate our children to read .They need to read about their nation, history and about people . A love for tradition has never weakened a nation, indeed it has strengthened nations in their hour of peril.- Winston S. Churchill

Fitch affirms  Standard Chartered Bank Sri Lanka Branch  at AAA(lka);  Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka Branchs (SCBSL) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
SCBSLs rating reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Standard Chartered Bank (SCB; Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at A+/Stable and Viability Rating at a).
The rating is linked with SCBs IDR to reflect SCBSLs legal status as a branch of SCB, which makes it part of the same legal entity.
It also reflects the relatively small size of the branch (around 0.15% of the total assets of SCB at end-2016), and therefore any support would not be material to the head office.
SCBs rating is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency IDRs of B+/Stable; and as a result, SCBSLs rating is at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka.
Fitch believes that support from SCB would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.

Forbidden art
In Sri Lanka the role of temple dancers did not carry any particular ritual purpose in the Sri Lankan Hindu temple traditions. Yet during the temple festivals these professional temple dancers performed dances in the temple premises as well as in the outer verandahs of the temples. Women of a particular caste were only supposed to perform this type of dance in the temples. The male members of this particular traditional class are still known Periyamelakarar because they play the large temple traditional musical instruments called Natheswaram or Nageswaram and Thavil.
Temple functions
Among all the traditional Tamil musical instruments, Natheswaram and Thavil are the biggest musical instruments. Thats why those who handle or play these instruments are often referred to as Periyamelakarar (that means the players of the big musical instruments). And the female members of this clan were known as Devaradiyarkal or Sinnamelakaries.
These female dancers were supposed to dance at the temple functions. With the passage of time, in Tamil Nadu practising and performing dances at the temples were banned by the State Legislative Assembly. Similarly, the moderate Hindu Tamil community and several social reformers of Sri Lanka also opposed the practice of dancing at the Hindu temples due to the malpractices of these temple dancers. And very often these dance programmes ended with disturbances.
The research studies on this subject reveal that first of all, the temple dance performances were stopped at the Arali Muttu Mari Amman temple in the Jaffna district by the bold action of the temple manager. This action caused vigilance among all the temple administrators in the island especially in the northern Sri Lanka. Gradually other temple authorities also tried to ban the dance performances at the Hindu temples in Sri Lanka. Similarly, many big temples like Nallur Kandaswamy temple, Jaffna and Mavidapuram Kandaswamy temple, Kankesanthurai also slowly discontinued and abandoned this tradition. Many of these temple dancers never adhered to the basic Hindu traditional norms or moral codes. They ate meat and danced at the temples.
Custom continued
Still reliable oral evidence reveals that most of these dancers drank and danced at the temples. All these incidents were the main causes to abandon these dance performances at the temples. When the big temples abandoned the temple dances, yet for a long time, village temples and small temples continued this custom. They arranged such programmes mainly to attract the crowd despite the fact that severe social stigma was strongly attached to this tradition.
During the British era the temple dancers were called Nautch girls. These temple dances were not considered as a part of temple rituals in Sri Lanka. But it was considered more or less as a social practice at the temples by the average people. However, in India dancing at temples was considered as a part of temple rituals.
According to Sri Lankan historical evidence of 1946, at one temple in Mallakam in the Jaffna district a large crowd was overwhelmed at a temple premises including, elderly people and small children irrespective of their age differences to view the dance performances of four Nautch girls in the temple premises.
Systematic refinement
This entertainment event normally started late in the nights and continued till the early hours of the following day. Those dancers dressed themselves with beautiful saris and heavy makeup. It was generally said that these dances of the Nautch girls were not either refined or systematically structured. No proper or well defined repertoire was adopted for their dances. Despite all these drawbacks certain temple authorities arranged these shows at their temples until the last quarter of the 20th century.
They arranged these shows just for entertainment especially during the festival time. Normally these dancers also started their dance with the invocation song on Lord Ganesha as usual in the Hindu tradition. In other words, the ancient temple dancers of Sri Lanka always dedicated the very first dance item to Lord Ganesha. In Hinduism Lord Ganesha is supposed to be the God of success, God of worldly wisdom and remover of obstacles, and later they switched on to some other songs of their own choice.
Hence the approach and practice of Hindu temple dance tradition in Sri Lanka was entirely different from the Indian Hindu temple dance traditions.

Irrigation Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa while addressing the media yesterday quelled rumours over the alteration of the status accorded to Buddhism, adding that the preservation and protection of the religion lies with the Head of State and that a Constitution was a pragmatic solution to the national question.
It is the sincere aspiration of the President and the Prime Minister that the creation of a new Constitution through consensus and discussion will unify its citizens for a peaceful country, he said.
Different politicians may have varying views, but the quest of this Unity Government has never been more firm, he said.
MinisterSoysa added that there have been many attempts throughout history to re-write a Constitution,while accoording the foremost place to Buddhism while treating every Sri Lankan as equal. Do not tarnish this effort, he said, adding that this was only the start of the process and not the final constitution.
The Minister further said it was a rare occasion where two major political parties had come together and reached a consensus for the creation of a new Constitution and requested people to make use of the opportunity than to sabotage the efforts of this government.

ZHUHAI Oct31, 2017: Former world number one Angelique Kerber suffered defeat at the hands of Russias Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on the first day of the WTA Elite Trophy Tuesday, a rough start for the German at the season-ending tournament.
Pavlyuchenkova, seeded fourth, beat 29-year-old Kerber 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 in one hour and 54 minutes at the Zhuhai Hengqin International Tennis Centre in southern China.
Eighth seed Kerber, who clinched both the Australian and US Open titles last year, still has a chance to qualify for the semis because of the round-robin format of the tournament.
Having struggled to find her feet in the first set, down 4-1 after the first five games, she managed to redeem herself in the second, gallantly holding serve in the third game and snatching a key break in game six before levelling the match.
The two traded service breaks at the start of the third set but it wasnt long before the Russian had Kerber on the run. I was not playing good in the first set. I start to play my game actually in the second set, and then, yeah, I think at the end she won the deciding points, she told media.
Earlier in the week the German, who has dropped from world number one in January to 19th, told AFP she had learned some lessons this year and was looking forward to a fresh start next season.
I dont think its the best year, she told the post-match press conference.
Today I was not able to play from the beginning my match and my game. So I was always having, like, up-and-downs, and thats for sure not the game I can play. Americas Coco Vandeweghe earlier beat her Chinese wild card opponent.
The second seed downed Chinas number one player Peng Shuai 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 in one hour and 55 minutes.
The 25-year-old had previously won only one match in her past four tournaments on Chinese soil.
She admitted starting off sloppy against Peng -- the oldest player in the line up and ranked 27 in the world.
Today was a survive and conquer kind of day, I really was playing not so well, very below average for the standard that Im used to playing, she told journalists.
Its a tough part of the year and a tough event... after the US Open its kinda, its, its rough, theres no secret about that, she said.
Peng had got off to a good start, securing the break in the second game and holding serve to give her a 3-0 lead.
But the American made a comeback in the second and third sets, losing serve just once.
Today I felt that I played pretty well but then my opponent did even better, said Peng, the crowd favourite, who also still has a shot at the semis. The Elite Trophy features 12 players placed nine and below in world rankings, while those ranked eight and above made up the field for the WTA Finals in Singapore which ended Sunday. AFP

Get priorities right to put cricket back on track
Sri Lanka cricket clearly needs to get its priorities right especially in the fifty-over one-day format if the team wants to make an impact at the next Cricket World Cup in England 2019 let alone think about winning it, which at this stage seems a far cry away and only a distant dream.
Sri Lankas sudden dip in form especially in their batting unit is something hard to explain and there doesnt seem to be a solution to how they can come out of the rut they have fallen into and is hurting them grievously.
Cricketers have come and gone over the years since Sri Lanka first played in the World Cup in 1975 but never have they experienced such a low depth in the batting, which has always been their forte even during the early years as a Test-playing nation. At the time it was the lack of international experience that proved a setback to our cricket until the arrival of Dav Whatmore as head coach of the national team. From 1995 the countrys cricket scaled the heights it has never reached before and remained so for the next two decades until after the 2015 World Cup when the dip in fortunes started to take place.
Sri Lanka has won only two bilateral ODI series (v West Indies and Ireland) out of 11 since then and apart from winning the tri-series in Zimbabwe that also included West Indies; they have failed to get beyond the first round of the ICC Champions Trophy.
To add more salt to the already festering wound they have suffered three 5-0 whitewashes this year alone at the hands of South Africa, India and Pakistan  so low has the countrys cricket sunk that it needs a Messiah to come and save it from total degradation.
Sri Lankas cricketing stocks has never been so low in the batting department where we have produced some of the greatest players ever to grace the cricket field. Sri Lanka maybe hit by injuries to Angelo Mathews, Kusal Perera and Asela Gunaratne that have weakened the middle order batting, but are we so famished of batsmen that we cannot find suitable replacements for them
The fault lies with the school system as well as the domestic club system  both of which have been diluted to the point that we are no longer producing the quality batsmen and bowlers we used to in the past. The club system as we are made to understand has been diluted by increasing the number of clubs from 14 to 24 to strengthen the vote base of the administration that is in power, and the schools system where the controlling body for the sport - the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association has no control on the number of matches a school plays for a season which has resulted in several schools playing as many as 20 or more matches, some against schools that are hardly competitive. As a result scoring 1000 runs and capturing over 50 wickets in a season has now become a very common feature compared to the past where batsmen got to the 1000-run mark playing only 10 matches or less.
When Graham Ford arrived as coach for a second term he said that there were no quick fixes to Sri Lankas present problems of team building and that it would be years before Sri Lanka becomes a top cricketing nation again. He saw his role as a long-term facilitator of the rebuilding process. The lack of short-term results prompted SLC to appoint a new coaching and management staff that led to loss of faith and the eventual resignation of Ford.
Since the series against Zimbabwe, SLC has been saddled with Nic Pothas whose credentials as head coach is a far cry when compared to those who had held that position before. A first-class cricketer Pothas previous experience at coaching before he took up the role of fielding coach of the Sri Lanka team was being appointed the first director of cricket of Guernsey, an island in the English Channel. To Pothas credit it must be said he has done an exceptional job in uplifting the teams fielding standards to the level where it is competing with other countries today. But whether he has the know-how and is qualified to hold the position of head coach to take Sri Lanka cricket forward is a matter of conjecture. Pothas is among the five who have applied for the permanent post of head coach which SLC will decide before the end of the year.
Sri Lanka also needs to look hard at the one-day captaincy. Upul Tharanga will come under scrutiny as all three whitewashes Sri Lanka has suffered this year have been under his captaincy. Tharanga is also facing the danger of a lengthy suspension for slow over-rate. During the last five months, he has been suspended twice for slow over-rate offences and another transgression will see him banned for six games. Tharanga seems to be a laid back captain who does not have the charisma or the drive to get the best out of his players. At the moment Sri Lanka is in dire need of someone to fit the bill, but the cupboard looks rather bare.
Dinesh Chandimal led the Test team from the front to beat Pakistan 2-0 and overcome the defeats suffered at the hands of India, a feat which the one-day and T20 teams failed to achieve.
Currently the national team seems to be starved a good leaders and good batsmen. Where is the countrys cricket heading
It is normally the bounden duty of the administration that is currently in power to uplift the cricketing standards of the country by finding solutions to the problems that are affecting the nations beloved sport. In that aspect the Sumathipala administration faces a tough challenge to extract the countrys cricket from its present predicament, a challenge which he has not faced in his previous three times as president.

Govt has provided relief to  pepper farmers - President
President Maithripala Sirisena underscored the need to adopt a dynamic plan to increase agricultural exports, while endorsing quantitative and qualitative standards of agricultural crops.
President Sirisena was speaking at the 45th Annual Session of the International Pepper Community held at the Earls Regency, Kandy recently.
He further added that the government has taken various steps for the development of the pepper industry and even though pepper prices decreased recently, the government has provided the necessary reliefs to pepper farmers. During the 2015, Sri Lanka exported around 16,660 metric tons (Mts) of pepper compared to 8,031 Mts in 2014, registering a 107% growth . When compared to the average export of 9,519 Mts over the last 10 years, export in 2015 was the highest.
The Government of Sri Lanka has considered that pepper, in addition to cinnamon, was the most important export spice commodity. Pepper production is confined to a few countries in Asia including Sri Lanka and the Pacific, Brazil and Madagascar.
Currently, Sri Lanka ranks at fifth place in terms of area under pepper cultivation after India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Brazil, and seventh place in terms of production, with a world share of 5.7% in production.
Also, Sri Lanka is the fifth largest exporter of black pepper, after Vietnam, Brazil, Indonesia, and India.
However, productivity levels in the industry remain low, despite improvements seen over the years.

Holder and Dowrich stand negates Razas wicket haul
BULAWAYO Oct31, 2017: An unbroken 144-run stand for the eighth wicket between Jason Holder and Shane Dowrich ensured the West Indies emerged from day three of the second Test against Zimbabwe on Tuesday with a vital first-innings lead.
Holder and Dowrich came together with the West Indies reeling on 230 for seven, still 96 runs short of Zimbabwes first-innings total, after Sikandar Raza tore into the tourists with a maiden five-wicket haul.
They turned the game on its head with a counter-attacking partnership as Dowrich ended Tuesday unbeaten on a career-best 75, while Holder contributed 71 not out.
That saw the West Indies to stumps on 374 for seven, leading by 48 runs.
Sometimes youre going to have to raise your hand and say that we tried everything and it didnt work because the opposition have batted well, Raza said. Credit to them for batting that well. The record partnership for the eighth wicket at Queens Sports Club took some of the shine off the offspinners five for 82, which was the first five-wicket haul by a Zimbabwean in Tests at the ground since 2003.
Having contributed 80 in the first innings, Raza was also the fifth Zimbabwean to score a 50 and take five wickets in a Test.
While the second evening had produced attritional cricket as the West Indians crawled to stumps on 78 for one, the tourists were more adventurous on day three with opener Kieran Powell leading the way in a 55-run stand for the second wicket with nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo.
It took the introduction of Raza to change the course of the morning, as he had Bishoo caught and bowled for 23 and then trapped Kyle Hope lbw for one.
Powell looked destined for a fourth Test century after he was dropped on 85 by Graeme Cremer, but seamer Chris Mpofu ensured the mistake was not costly as he used the second new ball to have the opener caught at gully for 90.
An attacking 56-run stand for the fifth wicket between Shai Hope and Roston Chase put the West Indies back on top after lunch, before Raza intervened once again.
After Chase was trapped lbw for 32 by the offspinner, Hope was bowled for 40 and Jermaine Blackwood became Razas fifth victim.
With a large deficit and just three wickets in hand the West Indies looked set to concede a first-innings lead on a difficult pitch, but Dowrich and Holder swung the match back in their favour.
Were only 48 runs ahead, but weve put lots of miles on their legs, said Powell.
Were going to come back tomorrow with two set guys, put some more miles on their legs and stretch out that lead as much as possible. Any lead is a good lead on this pitch. AFP

Hong Kong to become first Asian host of Gay Games
Hong Kong: Hong Kong will become the first Asian city to host the Gay Games in 2022 with rights campaigners celebrating the winning bid for a city often criticised for lagging on LGBT rights.
Hong Kong beat Mexico's Guadalajara and Washington DC to host the 11th edition of the event, with the jubilant bid team saying it would attract 15,000 participants and bring HK$1 billion into the local economy.
Organised by the LGBT community, the Gay Games features a range of sports and is open to all participants, "without regard to sexual orientation, and there are no qualifying standards", the Hong Kong bid team said in a statement.
Competitors come from many countries, including those where homosexuality remains illegal, it added. The Gay Games was founded by former Olympic decathlete Tom Waddell and first held in San Francisco in 1982. The next edition will be held in Paris in August next year, featuring 36 sports, from mountain biking to fencing and athletics.
Hong Kong's Pink Alliance, which promotes equal rights for the LGBT community, said the games would "help to bring a wider understanding and acceptance of our community", not only in the southern Chinese city but throughout the region. AFP

HSBC profit up as Asia business grows
Banking giant HSBC has reported pre-tax quarterly profits of $4.6bn (3.5bn) for the three months to the end of September.
The result marks a huge 448% increase from $843m posted in the same period a year ago. At that time, earnings were hit by a one-off loss of $1.7bn from the sale of its Brazilian unit. The latest result met market expectations and was helped by cost-cutting and a focus on Asia. "Our pivot to Asia is driving higher returns and lending growth, particularly in Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta," HSBC's chief executive, Stuart Gulliver, said in a statement. The firm's earnings were further boosted by higher premiums from its insurance and asset management businesses in Asia.
HSBC's shares were down more than 1% in late morning trading in London following the earnings update.

Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders has been named winner of the 2017 Man Booker Prize for Fiction. Lincoln in the Bardo is the first full-length novel from George Saunders, internationally renowned short story writer.
The 58-year-old New York resident, born in Texas, is the second American author to win the prize in its 49-year history. He was in contention for the prize with two British, one British-Pakistani and two American writers.
Lola, Baroness Young, 2017 Chair of judges, comments:
The form and style of this utterly original novel, reveals a witty, intelligent, and deeply moving narrative. This tale of the haunting and haunted souls in the afterlife of Abraham Lincolns young son paradoxically creates a vivid and lively evocation of the characters that populate this other world. Lincoln in the Bardo is both rooted in, and plays with history, and explores the meaning and experience of empathy.
Lincoln in the Bardo focuses on a single night in the life of Abraham Lincoln: an actual moment in 1862 when the body of his 11-year-old son was laid to rest in a Washington cemetery. Strangely and brilliantly, Saunders activates this graveyard with the spirits of its dead. The Independent described the novel as completely beguiling, praising Saunders for concocting a narrative like no other: a magical, mystery tour of the bardo  the intermediate or transitional state between ones death and ones next birth, according to Tibetan Buddhism. Meanwhile, the Guardian wrote that, the short story masters first novel is a tale of great formal daring...[it] stands head and shoulders above most contemporary fiction, showing a writer who is expanding his universe outwards, and who clearly has many more pleasures to offer his readers.
Saunders told TIME magazine that he didnt really want to write about Lincoln, but was so captivated by this story I'd heard years ago about him entering his son's crypt. I thought of the book as a way of trying to instil the same reaction I'd had all those years ago.
Lincoln in the Bardo is published by Bloomsbury, making it the third consecutive year the prize has been won by an independent publisher, following Oneworld Publications success in 2015 with Marlon James and 2016 with Paul Beatty. Bloomsbury has won the prize three times before, with Howard Jacobson (2010), Margaret Atwood (2000) and Michael Ondaatje (1992).
Saunders win comes in the month that 1989 Booker Prize-winning author Kazuo Ishiguro was named as this years Nobel Prize in Literature recipient. Ishiguro follows in the footsteps of other Booker Prize-recognised authors who have gone on to win the award including: V. S. Naipaul, Nadine Gordimer, William Golding, J. M. Coetzee and Doris Lessing.
Luke Ellis, CEO of Man Group, comments:

MAS recognized at Presidential  Environmental Awards
It's tough for large-scale companies to implement sustainability efforts across their organisations but that has not stopped MAS Holdings from trying.
Having integrated sustainability into the core of its business, MAS Holdings has demonstrated that a 'Change Inside' that resonates at a personal core is probably the best way to tackle sustainability issues.
This approach was recognized by the Presidential Environmental Awards this week where MAS took seven of the top awards in both the Apparel and Textile sectors.
Seven of the MAS facilities applied and were recognized for their efforts and their commitment to sustainability from having basic policies and data gathering to engineering more impactful waste, energy and water saving projects.
Auditors also applauded the fixed and regular culture building initiatives carried out by MAS which help both their staff and their communities appreciate and support the environment better.
Each facility scored extra points for specific sustainable solutions and standards such as ISO 14064, solar power projects, biogas facilities, water and energy efficiency measures, sustainable product lines and biodiversity projects.
MAS has a clear sustainability vision it calls the Change Inside where it seeks to generate more renewable energy than it uses by 2025 and reforest 25,000 acres - 100 times the space of its operational footprint. It has also set out clear goals to reduce energy and water usage as well as to become zero toxic in all products and processes.
Organised and audited by the Central Environmental Authority (CEA), the Presidential Environmental Awards seeks to reward individuals, institutions, organizations and activities which have made unique contributions to the field of environmental conservation and protection. The awards are given under three categories - Social, Culture, and Institutions. The process of auditing and choosing the finalists took 4-5 months with several rounds of auditing and checking of records and verifying projects.

Navy out to redeem lost prestige
The Navy Rugby team started playing rugby in 1961 in the B Division and in 1975 they competed for the first time in the "Division A" Rugby League, under the captaincy of P. L. B. Nandasiri. In their very first game against the 1974 Clifford Cup champions, Havelock SC they narrowly lost by 13 points to 9 at old Army grounds, Gall Face and in 1976 Navy SC competed in their first final of the Clifford Cup, captained by Ilex Perera, again losing to Havelocks 3-15. It wasn't until 1989 that Navy SC appeared in their next Clifford Cup final under the captaincy of now slain war hero Parakrama Samaraweera, losing to CR & FC 3-6 after making a sensational entry into the finals by beating formidable Police SC on a toss of a coin in the semi finals after the scores read 6 all even after the extra time and a penalty tie breaker having scored an easy 16-4 win over Havies in the quarter finals.
In 2010 and 2011 they were again successful in reaching the Clifford Cup final, falling short both times to Kandy SC. The club capped off an undefeated league season by also winning the Clifford Cup for the first time in the club's history beating Havelocks 27-22 in the finals in 2013/14 season thus remaining as the unbeaten double champions under flanker Rohitha Chichi Rajapaksa. Since then they have become one of the leading rugby playing Clubs for the past four years.
Since tasting success in 2013/14 season, Navy SC has failed to reach the top in local rugby arena as they by their own standards had a rather disastrous season last time around, in the 2016/17 season. Navy SC started on a winning note but when the season progressed they never get going from there onwards and finished overall in third place. The player who stood out on top from the rest in the last season is undoubtedly their young full back Thilina Weerasinghe who single-handedly won Navy team many matches with his accurate kicking and remained as the second highest total point scorer by collecting 154 points in the concluded league tournament.
But this time around in the 2017 /18 inter club league rugby season they are in a team building stage due to player transfers to other clubs. Several of their top class rugby players left the club to join other clubs this season including their cracking centre and Sri Lanka national player Lee Keegal, strongly built Sri Lanka national prop forward Sathya Ranathunga, Sri Lanka third row forward Sajith Saranga, Sri Lanka under 20 second row forward Matheesha Sarathchandra and Sri Lanka under 20 forward Chathura Dilshan who have joined CH and FC for the forthcoming season.
Fresh new players who have already joined Navy for the upcoming season are former Police Sports Club Scrum Half / Fly Half Mohamed Abzal, Havelocks Wing three quarter Rehan Thiyagaraja and Royal College/Police Sports Club/Sri Lanka Centre Mushin Faleel,
This rugby season the Navy rugby team will be captained by seasoned campaigner third row forward Danushka Gertha Perera.
Their main obligation this season is to regain the league title which they lost to Kandy SC in the last two seasons and in 2015/16 season virtually by a mere single try difference in total in the end.
Navy coaching staff comprises Head coach Mothilal Jayathilake, three quarters coach Dev Anandh together with their long serving manager Menaka Suranga will look to implement their style of game plan to take the Sailors towards success and powered Navy outfit to cause a few upsets this season and will be looking to improve their showing from last season this time around.

NDB posts PAT of  Rs 3.3 bn in Q3
National Development Bank PLC (NDB) reported a 64% commendable growth in its Profit After Tax over the comparative period to record Rs. 3,310 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017.
The Banks Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 5,679 million was an increase of 61% over the comparative period. Continuous and consistent improvement in core banking operations of the bank over the reported three quarters and dividend income from group companies contributed towards this remarkable performance.
The PBT and PAT of the bank, excluding the group dividends grew impressively by 51% and 50% respectively, which is a clear reflection of the strong performance of the core banking operations.
Net interest income (NII) recorded a 23% growth over the corresponding period to Rs. 7,656 million. Accelerated NII growth over the quarters was due to steady growth in loans and advances coupled with improved Net Interest Margins of 2.90% for the nine months of 2017 as compared to 2.62% for the comparative period.
Net Fee and Commission Income of Rs 1,812 mn for the period was a growth of 10% over the comparative period and was in line with the increase in business volumes. Net fee and Commission Income have progressively improved over the three quarters affirming that fee income remains a strategic priority in improving the profitability of the Bank. Net gains from trading had a 16% growth to Rs. 793 mn which was also in line with business volumes generated during the period.
Total Operating Income which is a combination of NII and non-interest income had a 29% growth to Rs 12.02 billion. The total impairment charges for loans and other losses for the nine months was Rs. 872 million, a reduction of 11% over the corresponding period last year. Sound credit review, effective monitoring and recovery processes adopted by the bank have resulted in reduced impairment charges for the period.
Total operating expenses was Rs 5,472 million, an increase of 13% over the comparative period. If not for the one-off cost involved in the pre-payment of a foreign currency loan, the increase was only 8% over the comparative period and reflects the efficient and effective cost management initiatives adopted by the bank, despite branch expansion and launch of new products during the period.
The cost to income ratio (CIR) of 45.8% was well within the banks targets of maintaining its CIR below 50%. The profit attributable to shareholders was Rs 2,520 million and was 28% over the comparative period.
The moderate performance in the capital markets activities experienced during the nine months period, continue to pose a challenge to the investment banking and stockbroking businesses within the NDB group, resulting in lower contribution from the group.

The petitioner states that he became aware through the media that Yasantha Kodagoda PC, Additional Solicitor General had on October 1, 2017 informed the Bond Commission, that the petitioner had made death threats against Anika Wijesuriya.
The petitioner states that when he became aware of the above on October 17,2017 he lodged a complaint with the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station against the fourth Respondent for assaulting and threatening him at the said Love Bar Club on October 14,2017. Nethikumara said on October 18,2017, several national newspapers too reported that Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC informed the Bond Commission 17th October 2017 that Anika Wijesuriya who gave evidence before the Presidential Commission fled the country due to death threats posed to her by various parities affiliated with Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The Petitioner states that the newspaper articles implied that SASG Yasantha Kodagoda had informed the Bond Commission that the Petitioner posed death threats to Anika Wijesuriya directly.
The Petitioner states that he was taken by surprise to read the claim that Anika Wijesuriya fled the country due to death threats posed to her by the Petitioner, as he learned from reports published that Anika Wijesuriya left the country on October 6,2017, 7 to 8 days before from the date on which the telephone conversations occurred.
The Petitioner further states that it has been alleged in the media that, Anika Wijesuriyas entire first week of October was spent in Bali and thereafter en route to London she had arrived in Colombo on October 5,2017 in the aircraft bearing No EK 349 at 1.55 a.m.
The Petitioner states that as per the same article, from 2.08 a.m. of October 5,2017 she was in Colombo until she left the country on an aircraft bearing No. EK 655 on October 6, 2017 at to 10.10 p.m. Nethicumara believes that Anika Wijesuriya was during the said time period spending a vacation out of the country and the position that she fled the country due to any death threats is far from truth.
Nethicumara states that in all the afore mentioned newspapers, it was reported that SASG Yasantha Kodagoda stressed that an investigation must be carried out with regard to the incident and that Police protection must be provided to family members of Anika Wijesuriya under Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015.
Nethicumara states that as per the newspaper articles, Anika Wijesuriya was already been named as a witness under the Protection of Victims of Crime and Witnesses Act No 4 of 2015.
Nethicumara states that by the contents of all newspaper articles aforementioned, the inference made was that he posed death threats to the 4th Respondent over Anika Wijesuriya giving evidence at the Bond Commission against Minister Ravi Karunanayake.

NEW CONSTITUTION NEEDED - PRELATE
The constitution making process should not be reversed due to the wants of a small minority of monks who want to bring back defeated politicians into power. The government should instead work to fulfil the aspirations of the 6.2 million people who voted for them, Asgiriya Chapter Deputy Parivenadipathi, Kadugannawa, Karuduwatte Sri Sudarshanaramadipathi, Ven. Yatiwaldeniye Medhankara Thera said yesterday. The President and the Prime Minister have made it clear to the country that neither the unitary state of the country nor the place given to Buddhism would be harmed by a new constitution.
The Ven Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter too has stated that there was nothing wrong with power devolution.
Thus it is clear that a few monks are working according to a political agenda to sabotage the new constitution, he added. The Thera explained that there were greater numbers of monks in favour of a new constitution compared to those who were against and that needed to be highlighted.

A new era of Parliamentary democracy
The 21st death anniversary of Sri Lanka's first Executive President JR Jayewardene falls today. Reproduced below is a speech made by him to mark the formal opening of the new parliament in Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte on April 29, 1982
Our country has a very ancient history of government with which the people were associated. Anuradhapura had a Mayor (Nagaraguthika) 2000 years ago; Polonnaruwa in the 11th Century A.D. had a Cabinet of Ministers and the buildings in which they deliberated are still to be seen. Village assemblies (Gan Sabhas) have existed from the earliest days.
When the Maritime Provinces came under British rule, Chief Justice Sir Alexander Johnston recommended in 1810 that Sri Lanka should be given a free Constitution. This did not happen because of a change of Government in the United Kingdom. A Legislative Council with official and unofficial members was however established in 1833.
Elections to the Legislative Council were first held in 1911 when a member called the Ceylonese Member was elected by the whole island on a very restricted franchise. Ponnambalam Ramanathan, later Sir, was the first to be so elected. In 1920 and 1924 the membership was enlarged and more members were elected. This Legislative Council existed till the grant of Universal Franchise and the creation of the State Council in 1931. The Elected Municipalities of Colombo Kandy and Galle were established in 1865.
The Legislative Council sat in the building erected opposite Gordon Gardens which later was the home of the Senate and now of the Presidential Secretariat and Conference Hall.
From 1930 sittings were held in the State Council building which Hon. Members vacated a few weeks ago. The Legislative Council, The State Council, The House of Representatives. The National State Assembly and Parliament sat here from 1930-1931; 1931-1947; 1947-1972; 1972-1978 and 1978-1982 respectively.
Free elections and Democratic freedoms
Many famous sons of Sri Lanka elected by the people, no longer with us, have taken part in debates in these two buildings; Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan, Sri James Peiris, Sir D B Jayatilake, E W Perera, D S Senanayake, W A de Silva, S W R D Bandaranaike, Sir John Kotelawala, Dudley Senanayake, Sir Francis Molamure, T B Jayah, George E de Silva, A E Goonesinha, Philip Gunawardena, N M Perera, G G Ponnambalam, S J V Chelvanayakam, S A Wickramasinghe and several others whose names are part of the political history of our country. They belonged to two generations that preceded the generation that sits in the Chamber today. I have been associated with all of them except Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan and Sir James Peiris during the 44 years of my public career. My father and his brothers were Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan's sponsors in the 1911 election and they worked with Sir James Peiris and some of the others mentioned above to establish the Ceylon National Congress in 1918.
There is only one Member of the 1931 State Council elected by Universal Franchise still alive, Vaithialingam. I hope he is here today. There are two who were Members of the Second State Council elected in 1936 alive and still in active politics - myself elected in 1943 and Dr Dahanayake, MP elected in 1944. Both of us have seen these Assemblies in peaceful periods and also in turbulent moods. We have both been State Councillors.
Members of Parliament, Back-Benchers, Ministers, Opposition Leaders and Prime Ministers and I am sure it is as much a pride to him as it is to me to be able to be with you today.
In 1947 was elected the first Parliament which had the opportunity of governing a Lanka free once again after 133 years. From 1947 we have had 8 general elections, several by-elections, six changes of government. Free elections and Democratic freedoms have survived throughout this period.
The new building we occupy today is situated in a city, Sri Jayawardhanapura, Kotte, which was the capital of Sri Lanka from 1411-1568. Western imperialists first came to our land during this period.
Though Bhuvenekabahu V ruled at Gampola during the latter years of his reign, he also called himself King of Jayawardenepura, Kotte, where Nissanka Alagakkonara had built the fort of Jayawardenepura, Kotte. It was however, in 1411 when Parakramabahu VI began what was to be a very long reign that he established himself here and it was he who really founded the Jayawardenepura Kotte Kingdom. He gave it supremacy over other subject kingdoms in the country; contributed to its golden era of poetry and during his 55 years of rule made this period rich in literature, incidents and achievements.
He was the first Sinhalese Monarch since the days of Parakramabahu I and Nissankamalla to bring the whole island under one rule, and the last ever to do so. Even today the Sandesa poems which reached their maturity in his period and Kavyasekera and Guttila Kavya are a source of enduring joy. Owing to the constant harassment by the Portuguese the kingdom moved from Jayawardenepura (Kotte) to the Udarata (Kandy) and in 1597 the city was finally abandoned and its temples, buildings and monuments were razed to the ground by the Portuguese.
Hopes and aspirations for future
We see around us in these new buildings, features that represent the culture and heritage of the past and embody our hopes and aspirations for the future. We commence here a new era of Parliamentary Democracy in a Chamber worthy of an Elected and Sovereign Assembly. Let us look after this building and its environs carefully.
What should be the standard of conduct we should maintain Let us ask ourselves some of the questions the Buddha asked, when King Ajasatta of Magadha sought his advice as to whether they should go to war with the Republic of the Vaggis:
Do the Vaggis have frequent gatherings Are they well attended
Do they assemble and disperse peacefully
Do they attend to their affairs in concord
Do they proceed in accordance with their ancient laws
Do they show respect and honour; esteem and veneration towards their elders and deem it worthwhile to listen to them
Do they show respect and honour; esteem and veneration towards their shrines
These conditions lead to a nation's welfare. If they follow them their growth is to be expected, not their decline, he said.
In this Temple of Democracy let us so conduct ourselves for the welfare of the many, that generations yet unborn may say, that within this Chamber our words and conduct represented our finest hours.

New York attack: Eight killed by man driving truck

At least eight people have been killed and 11 seriously hurt in New York after the driver of a truck mowed down people on a cycle path in Lower Manhattan.
A 29-year-old man who emerged from the white pick-up truck was shot by a police officer and arrested. Officials later said it was a terror attack.
Media named him as Sayfullo Saipov, an immigrant who came to the US in 2010.
A note was found in the truck that referred to so-called Islamic State, a law enforcement source told CBS News.
The suspect - who had apparently settled in Florida - was taken to hospital.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said it was a "cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians".
He added: "We know that this action was intended to break our spirit. But we also know that New Yorkers are strong, New Yorkers are resilient and our spirit will never be moved by an act of violence and an act meant to intimidate us."
President Donald Trump tweeted:"My thoughts, condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!"
New York Police Department (NYPD) Commissioner James O'Neill said the injured had "serious but non-life threatening injuries".
He described what had occurred, based on the latest information he had received:
Shortly after 15:00 local time (19:00 GMT), a vehicle rented from retailer Home Depot struck cyclists and pedestrians while being driven along the West St-Houston St path for many blocks
The vehicle then hit a school bus, injuring two adults and two children on board, and came to a halt
The driver emerged holding what appeared to be two handguns and made a statement "consistent with a terror attack"
He was shot in the abdomen by a police officer stationed near the scene
A paintball gun and a pellet gun were recovered from the scene
"The dead and injured were just going about their days, heading home from work or from school or enjoying the afternoon sun on their bicycles," the commissioner said.
"This is a tragedy of the greatest magnitude for many people, for many families here in New York and beyond today."
Mangled bicycles littered the scene of the attack, which occurred as much of the city was celebrating Halloween.
One witness, identified as Eugene, told ABC Channel 7 that he saw the white pick-up truck driving fast down the cycle path alongside the West Side Highway, near Stuyvesant High School, at full speed and hitting a number of people.
He also reported hearing about nine or 10 shots.
Another witness, who gave his name as Frank, told local TV network NY1 that he had seen a man running around an intersection and heard five to six gunshots.
"I saw he had something in his hand, but I couldn't tell what it was. But they said that it was a gun...
"When the cops shot him, everybody started running away and it got a little bit crazy right there. So when I tried to look again, the guy was already down."
President Donald Trump had been briefed on the incident, the White House said.
In separate tweets, he said:
"In NYC, looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!"
"We must not allow ISIS [Islamic State] to return, or enter, our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!"
Piecing the evidence together
At the moment the New York authorities are saying that it was a lone wolf, that the attack wasn't part of a wider conspiracy or plot.
But this is an active crime scene at the moment and they are still trying to piece together precisely what happened.
The attack happened on Halloween, one of the most festive days in the New York calendar.
The pavements were crowded with kids in costumes and there are still children trick-or-treating just yards away - it's a bizarre scene.
But it shows how New York absorbs this kind of thing.
We are just yards from Ground Zero, a site which reminds all New Yorkers of that awful day back in 2001. It didn't take police long to confirm that the city had once again been the target of terror.

oDoc wins Commonwealth  Digital Health Award
oDoc, a Sri Lankan startup linking patients with doctors on-demand, emerged winners in the Telemedicine category at the recently concluded Commonwealth Digital Health Awards. Developed over 12 months, the award-winning platform provides a "360 degree solution" for both patients and doctors - providing pre-consultation notes on an electronic health record, video consultations, and a valid prescription sent to your smartphone.
This saves users from the hassle of waiting rooms and traffic jams with the advantages of better diagnoses and treatment augmented by modern technology.
The Commonwealth Digital Health Conference and Awards ceremony, held at the Cinnamon Grand Colombo, marked the launch of the Commonwealth Digital Health Initiative followed by the adoption of the Commonwealth policy brief on 'Digital Systems for One Health'.
The highlight of the conference was the digital health mall, which showcased 35 shortlisted digital health innovations from India, Singapore, Malaysia, Malta, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Norway and South Africa.
Speaking after the awards ceremony, Heshan Fernando, founder and CEO of oDoc said "We put medical consultation and e-prescriptions into the palm of your hands and we are doing this by combining mobile technology and artificial intelligence with the best clinical expertise." Fernando highlighted pediatric and dermatological consultations as popular use cases. He also pointed to the option for anonymous consultations through oDoc being particularly useful for those seeking sexual and mental health consultations.
Explaining oDoc further, Fernando stated "You can basically book appointments in seconds and see a doctor fully registered with the Sri Lanka Medical Council whenever you want, wherever you are, through just three taps of your smartphone.
Once you request your consultation, the doctor will then video call you, assess your condition and provide you with a valid prescription with the doctor's seal, right to your phone. All within a matter of 10 minutes. The showing of lab reports and follow-up visits could take place the same way.
Studies have shown nearly 75 per cent of all regular doctor visits could be handled effectively through video just like this." Dr. Janaka Wickramasinghe, who is a practicing doctor and a founder of oDoc explains, "The benefits of this system don't end with just convenience. We built an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) platform from the ground up just to assist these video consultations.
This allows a doctor to document a consultation digitally rather than through written notes. "
oDoc have to-date signed on 10 companies including MAS Active, Union Assurance, Expolanka, Hela, Akbar Brothers, and Brandix, and will have a total of 20,000 users on their cards.The platform together with its fast adoption rate has also drawn the attention of investors, with the startup raising US$ 1 million in funding - Sri Lanka's largest seed round investment - from Ajit Gunawardena, Brandix and LOLC.
The nascent Sri Lankan startup ecosystem is on the path to gain a boost if startups like oDoc gain traction and can scale operations.

Over 6,000 Co-operative employees in the Southern Province will be provided with a pension, starting from January. The decision was conveyed by Co-operative Development Commissioner G. L. N. K. Kularatne, who recently visited the Co-operative Department in Galle. This decision was taken in consultation with the Chairman and General Manager of all Cooperative Societies in the Southern Province.
Accordingly, 80 percent of the final wage earned just before retirement is expected to be paid as a pension. The concept proposed by Southern Province Co-operative Minister U. G. D. Ariyathilaka, will have the same format as the pension scheme implemented by the North Western Provincial Co-operative Department.
The Beralapanathara and Beliatta Co-operative Societies already have a functioning pension scheme, but this will be a first for the Southern Province.

Parent numbers seeking mantenance allowances on the rise
The number of parents who seek legal aid for maintenance allowances from their well-to-do children, is currently on the rise. Accordingly, about 131 aged parents have filed cases against their children during the first nine months of this year as those children have ignored them after owning all their properties and lands legally by way of title deeds.
Last year, 93 complaints were received by the Social Welfare Ministry and these figures have been confirmed by the National Secretariat of the Elders Director Suminda Singappuli.
Most of these children who have neglected their aged parents are professionally-qualified government doctors, lawyers, engineers and other categories of high-ranking officials. Some are employed abroad at present. In Sri Lanka, about 1.7 million persons who are above 60 years of age are currently living in the country.
"Since certain children dont look after their aged parents, a suitable insurance and welfare project for aged parents have to be introduced in the future by government authorities," said Kurunegala Divisional Secretary W. E. Jayathilake, speaking at a meeting of representatives of elders societies of the Kurunegala district held yesterday at the Bingiriya Youth Training Centre in Kurunegala.

As delay may deprive country's democracy
Constitution should include election dates
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne questioned if the Constitution should not include the election dates as the delay in elections deprives the democracy of a country.
He also said the Constitution should limit the amounts spent on elections by politicians. He said that the identity of those who finance politicians at elections should be revealed since the vote should not be allowed to be bought.
He made these observations yesterday, during the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in Parliament.
He said that there had been long dialogues if Sri Lanka needed a new constitution.
He added that 40 years had elapsed since the second republic constitution passed. There had been issues with the same constitution. Chandrika Kumarathunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa protested demanding the withdrawal of the same constitution.
"Then President Chandrika Kumarathunga's attempt to pass a new constitution in 2000 proved a failure," State Minister Wickramaratne said. "Later, the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa sharpened his powers by way of an amendment to the Constitution instead bringing in a new constitution. The Mahinda Chintanaya 2015 too stressed the need for a new constitution."
He said that Mahinda Rajapaksa staged protests when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was made, claiming the country would be divided. He questioned as to whether it had happened as Rajapaksa predicted.
He also added that when there was an issue at a particular area, the majority and those who were in power had to solve the issue.
"Always there are people who needed to divide the country," State Minister Wickramaratne said. "But we could not be driven by such demands and make a constitution."
He also said however, the country has to make a new constitution that was accepted by the majority of the minority groups. He also added that the proposals should be able to be accepted by the Sinhalese who are the majority of this country as a whole as well.
"We have missed many such opportunities of bringing in new constitutions," Wickramaratne said. "We should not miss this opportunity."
The UNP and the SLFP, the two parties of the government have a major responsibility in solving this issue.
A fear had been created that there was an attempt to divide this country by means of this new constitution. This report has it that the new constitution should have clauses that prevent the country being divided and it also recommends that there should be clauses that no province nor a section of the country could be separated or be promoted to do so. "None of us wish to divide this country," Wickramaratne said. "There is no hidden agenda behind this new constitution."
He also questioned if the Cabinet should not be limited, prevent delay of elections etc, by way of this new constitution.
CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES FOREMOST PLACE TO BUDDHISM, CITIZENS' RIGHTS: MANGALA
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday asked as to how could anybody could object to a Constitution that guarantees rights of all citizens and essentially honours the Lord Buddhas teachings of Metta, Muditha, Karuna, Upekka.
The minister was taking part in the Constitutional Assembly debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee. Observing that Sri Lanka cannot afford to miss this window of opportunity to create political stability and achieve prosperity and economic development, Samaraweera pleaded to seize the opportunity and go forward as one nation.
The minister, who took the floor after UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma, reminded the House how MP Alahaperuma together with colleagues Nalanda Ellawala and Dilan Perera went from village to village campaigning for a new Constitution in 1995 under the Sudu Nelum Movement.
It is he who asked in the House today as to whether the country needs a new Constitution. The draft Constitution that MP Alahapperuma then campaigned for was a far more progressive one than what we have proposed in terms of power sharing. That draft Bill did not contain the word unitary but united. It even agreed to offer police and land powers to the Provincial Councils, the minister recalled.
The minister citing several statements by former leaders SWRD Bandaranaike, JR Jayawardena, Mahinda Rajapaksa, Rohana Wijeweera and also the Communist Party, pointed out all have agreed beyond question that there is an ethnic issue in the country.
All people, irrespective of background and which part of the country they live in, have suffered the horrors of violence for long years. They have sadly been deprived and cheated of the rights of economic prosperity that this nation could have achieved during the last 70 years.
All the citizens of this country desire for lasting and sustainable peace, equal citizenship, respect, economic prosperity, equal protection of the law and they all want to call this land their home. We must be able to be united in diversity he added. The minister pointed out the Constitution making process followed by the Government was completely a bottom up and all inclusive process which left nobody behind.
Steering Committee interim report prepared after considering public views :Rajitha
It has been the first time that preparations of an interim report for a Steering Committee on the Constitutional Reforms was made after looking into the views of the public, said Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne yesterday.
He said that since January 2016, public views were taken to prepare the interim report, adding that even for the changing of the electoral system, a new Constitution needed to be formulated.
He made these observations yesterday, during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms, which was held in Parliament.
Minister Senaratne further said that six decades had passed after the late SWRD Bandaranaike had attempted to solve this issue.
"I always fought for the abolition of the Executive Presidency," Minister Senaratne said. "I regret that I had to vote in favour of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution."
He added that devolution of power was not a new topic. "It had been functioning for a long time now. None could oppose this and call himself a true patriot," Minister Senaratne said. "There is no other traitor than those who oppose this. The biggest victory for this Constitution is that the TNA is agreeing to support it, which was an unprecedented opportunity. Therefore, we must grasp this opportunity." Health Minister Senaratne said that during the Constitutional Council in 1972, the late J R Jayewardene proposed for the Executive Presidency, but the late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake refused it. But in 1978, Late Jayewardene and late R Premadasa set up the Executive Presidency.
"But late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike pledged that she would abolish it at the first opportunity they get to do so," Minister Senaratne said. "Former Presidents Chandrika Kumarathunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa too promised to do so."
He also said that G L Peiris maintained that a President should be a nominal President. Dinesh Gunawardena too said the executive Presidency should be abolished. For the first time we have a President who was ready to reduce his powers.
"So we should not miss this opportunity," Minister Senaratne said.
New Constitution a Trojan Horse
The new constitution is a Trojan Horse brought to Sri Lanka, said Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma yesterday.
He also said there are similarities in the new Constitution and the existing one. He added that the when the 1978 constitution was formulated the opposition Leader was Amarthalingam whereas today the opposition leader is R Sampanthan. The leader was J R Jayewardena in 1978 and today Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He made these observations during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in the House of the Parliament.
He also said that although this is a historic event there are many flaws in the process. He added that Wijayedasa Rajapakshe had questioned the legality of the process. On the first day of the debate a government side deputy minister resigned from position and came to sit with opposition. He added that by the time of the debate an American war ship was in Colombo Harbour and he could understand the message of it clearly. However he questioned as to who was correct, was it the then President J R Jayawardena who formulated the 78 constitution or those who protested against it. He added however although the American constitution that was formulated 241 years ago had been amended 27 times the Sri Lankan Constitution that was formulated 40 years ago has been amended at 20 occasions.
Due to JO's stance of criticizing new Constitution
Bandula lost a chance to highlight his progressive contribution as Chairman of Finance Sub-Comm.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti pointed out that the Joint Opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena lost the chance to highlight his progressive contribution as the Chairman of Finance Sub-Committee because of the JOs stance of fiercely criticizing everything related to the new Constitution.
Taking part in the Constitutional Assembly debate on Constitutional Reforms, Handunnetti pointed out Finance Sub-Committee, in which he was a member, has proposed empowering Parliament in a meaningful way to establish effective parliamentary control and thorough supervision over projects undertaken utilizing public finance.
It has also proposed disclosing the advantages and disadvantages related to major public investments undertaken either as public or public-private partnerships. These are progressive proposals. Is the JO asking to discard all these by abandoning the Constitution making process he asked.
Handunnetti revealed that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya recently convened a meeting with the COPE and COPA Chairmen, Auditor General, the Finance Minister and Finance Ministry Secretary to discuss on follow up actions on the reports of Parliamentary watchdog committees. The Speaker, referring to five COPE reports and three COPA reports, presented in the current Parliament said that he felt it as a big sin to overlook the revelations in them.
He asked what measures could be taken in such regard. This again highlighted the need to strengthen Parliament control of public finance in a more meaningful manner, he noted.
The MP, pointing out that a constructive debate on the content of Interim Report could not be seen in the country, said some are trying to pander to ultra-nationalist mentality by using the report as a football and as a short cut to power.
Unitary status and position granted to Buddhism
Viable solution applicable to all communities should be reached
Let's try to negotiate and reach a viable solution applicable to all communities as nothing is affecting the unitary status and the position guaranteed to Buddhism, said Highways State Minister Dilan Perera yesterday.
He said further that the this is the last bus that the country gets to formulate a new constitution with the co-operation of all communities of the country so all should attempt not miss it.
He made these observations yesterday during the debate on the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms which was held in the House of the Parliament. He said that all the parties and communities would not be able to fulfill their aspirations in this endeavor and all have to be flexible. "All leaders who were in power attempted to solve the issue but failed," State Minister Perera said. "But we all have a habit of objecting all."
He also said that during the Sudunelum movement Mahindananada Aluthgamage, C B Rathnayake and myself went from village to village for a united country.
"I think Althgamage could not have two thoughts," State Minister Perera said. "Even Wasudeva Nanayakkara maintains that there should be power devolution. But he has a different issue with Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe. So he hesitates to support this."
State Minister Perera further said there is a split in the Joint Opposition and the Parliament cant stop formulating the new constitution for fear of the cardboard hero Wansa. He also said that the Tamils too have issues. "The Tamil women remained within palm leaf fences," State Minister Perera said. "But the issues dragged them out of the fences bearing weapons."
He added that cast system is festering most of the Tamil people in Jaffna. "These issues have to be addressed soon," State Minister Perera said.

Pick and stick with Ashes 'keeper, says Gilchrist
Sydney: Wicketkeeping great Adam Gilchrist has called on Australian selectors to pick and stick when they decide who will be behind the stumps for the upcoming Ashes series.
Three players are seen as being in the mix to take the gloves -- and also provide middle-order batting stability -- ahead of the first Test against England in Brisbane on November 23.
They include the current incumbent Matthew Wade, who has struggled with the bat, his predecessor Peter Nevill, who was axed 12 months ago, and the fast-improving Alex Carey.
Whoever gets the nod should be given an extended run, said Gilchrist, who played 96 Tests, making more than 400 dismissals and scoring over 5,500 runs.
"Whoever they pick, they just need to give them a good run at it," he told radio station SEN late Monday.
"Say 'We've got to settle here now'. Like they've done with (Matthew) Renshaw at the top of the order.
"He was untried and they threw him in there. He's had 10 or 11 Tests now."
Gilchrist pointed to fellow wicketkeepers Ian Healy and Rod Marsh as players who repaid the faith of selectors by becoming greats of the game.He said there were arguments for all three players, but he believed South Australian Carey, 26, could be the surprise pick despite his lack of international experience.
"I'm hearing a big push for Carey from South Australia," he said.
"He's slightly younger than the others... I believe he's a very hard worker and a top team man and a good guy to have around.
"I'm probably starting to think that it's more likely that (selectors) might say 'OK youngster, you're in'." AFP

Plantation  crisis and  solutions
Large commercial plantations are considered as a country within a country and most planters do go through trying circumstances with physical and mental stress as a given! They now need to gird themselves with what it takes with a professional and results-based approach to conquer the challenges thrown at them in the future.
Looking ahead to the future, we see that the plantations that move away from mono-crop models to multi-crops and optimize the varied and rich resources found in plantations will still be the mainstay of our economy.
We hope that agro-based business encompassing alternate power, unconventional, adventure tourism to name a few, along with multi-cropping ventures, would elicit much attention by the state and indeed by multinational corporate entities than ever before as plantations embark on a new beginning that is lying latent  only to be seized with those blessed with courage and vision!
Learn from past lapses
We dont wish to dwell on the lapses of the past; neither do we wish to blame individuals or organizations but we need to make certain that we avoid such destructive mistakes in future. We have been stressing on the systematic killing of the plantations industry of Sri Lanka due to mostly short-term rapacious exploits through a series of newspaper articles during the past two years.
We thank all those newspapers wholeheartedly for the yeomen service to the nation by publishing them amidst fierce propaganda by a small, yet influential group of people claiming to be the industry leaders.
We believe that there is fundamentally not much wrong with most employees of the industry but the leadership of certain RPCS led to a point of almost no return for the industry. If we scan the RPCs, it is not difficult to understand that the root cause for better performing RPCs and poorly performing RPCs is the CEO or indeed the greedy Board of Directors who have made a pawn of CEOs.
These CEOs get the blame for making their ravenous owners happy. Not that they arent aware of the consequences of extractive agriculture or inexplicable investments away from the core business but their survival depends on the ability of making these owners delighted. Ours is a country where such highly paid jobs (of CEO) are scarce, especially to the incompetent. So these incompetent CEOs choose a winning strategy to delight their master (owner) by hook or by crook and safeguard their self-interests, perks and benefits, unmindful that the plantations are being destructively exploited. We find that certain stockbrokers are also guilty of not disclosing the truth to the investors and making a fast buck by devious and unethical means.
A CEO must have the competencies to perceive change and proactively execute appropriate strategies that will be dramatic in mitigating the impacts of the escalating costs and managing other risks. That includes the growth of the business as well. The resources are going to be scarce when the population keeps on increasing.
We propose that these CEOs who hardly perceive the practical reality of supply and demand but wait for opportunities to assign blame to anyone, be trained at PIM through short courses. PIM has been conducting similar programs in the past for senior executives of other industries and they have been performing absolutely great following the training. In terms of interventions through HRM, there are many CEO coachs and consultancy firms in the market that can help these top executives until they become fit to perform their jobs. These are the short term strategies the Ministry of Plantations Industries can launch. Most CEOs heading those poorly performing RPCs, are adequate trainable material with loads of experience.
Areas of concern
It is patently clear that opportunities are lost when diversification onto other crops are not carried out in a timely manner. Such favorable crops could afford to attract and retain high-calibre professionals. Furthermore, lack of attention to soil development and enrichment, poor attitude towards groundwater retention, not proactively mitigating the risks and realities of climate change, lack of developing people objectively and systematically, not adding value to the process (entire value chain) or to the product, not undertaking lifecycle analysis and no initiatives to decrease inefficiency of both men and machinery are a handful of such reasons.
It is the responsibility of the CEOs to manage them. That is why we say that the blame should be placed fairly on to mediocre qualitydecision-making. Who is fooling whom The excessive cost of the industry is due to low productivity, poor quality (land, labour, machinery, power) and the waste of energy. The production of crops has gradually diminished over the years. This is one of the main reasons why the labour productivity has plummeted. Do the RPCs expect the productivity to be brought by the employees from their respective homes It is the duty of successful agribusiness managers not to allow a single ray of sunlight to go waste without being converted into cash.
Why ask for glyphosate
To re-cap, we use five types of weeding mechanisms such as contact herbicides, selective weedicides, translocate weedicides, systemic weedicides and cultural weeding practices by bush-to-bush merger and planting an appropriate leguminous cover crop on the vacant patches so that weeds can be easily controlled, etc. Ideally weeds need to tackled before they reach flowering stage as flowers produce seeds that germinate when right conditions such as good soil, moisture and sunlight are available. Whilst good soil and moisture cannot be controlled, sunlight could be, by proper cultural methods.
In agriculture, the scientists recommend a combination of organic and inorganic fertilizers. In the plantation agriculture, the recommendations are to use chemical or inorganic fertilizer only. In reality, the subject of fertilizer is a combination of organic, inorganic and soil pH in backdrop of hydrolysis. We understand that the Institute of Nano Technology has come out with a fertilizer with organic, inorganic properties and a buffer action to correct pH. Without the soil carbon or the organic properties of the soil, the microbes will not thrive. In the absence of microbes, the soil becomes almost dead or sterile. It is these microbes which convert artificial or chemical fertilizer into plant food that is consumed through the demand created due to plant metabolism activities.
The requirement of chemical fertilizer too can be reduced due to the increase in the useful microbial population of bacteria and fungi. Furthermore, this will also be useful in managing diseases and retention of soil moisture with soil temperature that is conducive for higher yields.
Fertilizer plays an important role in agriculture. Usage of fertilizer becomes useless without a proper understanding of the important role played by soil. The global agriculture is moving towards precision agriculture and LEISA techniques such as low external inputs and sustainable agriculture. This is another reason why the costs are high. Organic and integrated farming concepts have enough to offer in this direction of animal husbandry and crop production. We are very vulnerable to impending droughts without maintaining a proper soil structure, which can again send our costs through the roof.
Yet, what do we do We blame the employees for high costs. When farmers all over the world use drones like technologies to improve overall efficiencies, we keep on blaming the employees for non-existent issues in order to hide our lunacy.
This is why we say that the Prime Minister has understood the reality, compounded by errant RPCs.
A grand investment opportunity
If there are any entrepreneurs interested in land-based investments leading to profitable business outcomes, a plantation of Sri Lanka will undoubtedly be an ideal opportunity. The infrastructure is well developed and supports to exploit the untapped potential for residential development, commercial development, export crop producing, growing of medicinal herbs, livestock raising, growing of valuable timber, mineral production, vegetable farms, vineyards, orchards, warehousing, processing plants and even recreational activities (outdoor adventure) leading to health and fitness; these aresome opportunities, just to name a few.
Do we havea product in tea
I am not going to much detail on this subject as I had elaborated on same in the last article of mine which appeared in the newspapers last month. Anyway, it is most unfortunate that for the last 150 years, we have been unable to develop a product due to lack of a product. If products were developed out of tea, then there wont be a need for an auction system as products are marketed and not auctioned.
Therefore, the decision makers and the government must be conscious enough to refrain from spending millions on selling commodities overseas on the disguise of tea promotion. Lets have a look at how a product is defined and compare with what we call a product to understand how to do better.
A product attributes include size, color, functionality, components and features that affect the product's appeal or acceptance in the market. The industry must hire food scientists and food technology experts to develop a product. We hope that those holding high positions are aware of basics of marketing and how to make a consumer friendly product that will be in high demand. Both Jayewardenepura and Peradeniya Universities can be made use for this gigantic task which is peanuts for the scientists there.
A good example in this regard is Dilmah tea. This much sought-after product received its global recognition on the strength of the finest Ceylon tea. In the light of this definition, all of us are well aware that only a very little has been done by the RPC management to create a product, except maybe by a few. Tea can be made to be a health food by extracting its medicinal properties (anti-oxidants) and soft gel capsuling it. Never to underestimate our potential due to availability of seven types of different teas in here on their agroclimatic locations. The question is where are our goals and strategies to move this industry forward We do not have a vision, let alone goals and strategies. Whom do we blame for the dire state of this industry
Let us get out of this blame culture. Its never too late to make a change. We believe that the tea industry can be turned around to become a US$ 10 billion industry. Whilst we assure the total commitment in achieving this goal as planters, the other professionals such as finance, accountants, marketing, IT, economists, agronomists, and HRM must come out with hybrid strategies as enablers of making it happen. For planters nothing is impossible. For that, they have been trained to bloom wherever they plant!
For the first time the CPS, PA and NIPM have embarked on a timely effort in defining the profession of a planter. A planter leads an agribusiness professionally to reach desired growth sustainably. The objective of this initiative is to define the profession and also to develop a set of professional standards which are a fitting intervention at a time we celebrate 150 years of tea in Sri Lanka.
In conclusion, we agree with Albert Einstein and it is about time that we start with the end in mind. We must be crystal clear as to what we expect from the business of plantation management. Will it be a smart plantation or else conventional How do we plan the growth What are our retention and cost mitigating strategies What are our product or services portfolios Are we going to go green and what is our business model, are some of the key areas that we should be clear.
We proposed a financial goal of US$ 10 billion revenue per year from the industry. All master plans developed so far for the plantations industry must be used to develop implementation and monitoring strategies. The implementation should be with the qualified professionals such as operations, HRM, marketing, finance, engineering and IT/ICT. Its only through a qualified and competent head (CEO) armed with requisite skills of managing these professionals to achieve the planned goals. Needless to say, if history repeats itself, it will be the final snap of the rope ending in the doom of the plantation industry.
Over to you Mr Prime Minister. Your Minister in charge of the industry will never let you fail. We are fully aware of the smart strategies employed by your Minister in bringing in appropriate technology from the best countries to improve efficiencies of theoverall systems of plantations industries.
We need the right mindset and attitude from the top to bottom. We also need advanced technologies, right products, improvements in per capita income, more employment opportunities in plantations and we need ahigh-performance culture in the industry.
The turning point is discipline which must be upheld always. This paves the way for the formation of the Green Army and thats all employees in uniforms. High level of physical fitness to all grades involved in plantation agriculture is compulsory. How do you expect all those who cannot walk to go to the fields and set as an example to the staff and workers A fit mindset will remain always inside a physically fit body.
We are with you and looking for opportunities for restoring beyond much spoken former glory. Mr Prime Minister, you know that you have to break eggs to make omelettes. Also we need to remind you of one more HRM principle and that is - right people drive business. This applies to the entire country.

PM and the media
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is perhaps the only leader in post independence Sri Lanka who had been criticized, insulted and humiliated in equal measure, while being both in the government and Opposition. One has only to recall the insults and calumny heaped on Wickremesinghe during his long innings in the Opposition, under both, the Chandrika and Mahinda regimes. Not only was he insulted at a political level but he was also humiliated at a personnel level too. One recalls how posters bearing the distorted visage of Wickremesinghe, of the likeness of a famous comedian in the western cinema, was splashed across the country on the eve of the 1999 presidential election. However, to his credit, Premier Wickremesinghe, characteristically, came out of it all, unscathed, and better for the experience.
However, sections of the media are still baying at him. While criticism from certain quarters is somewhat measured, there are other media houses which have openly come out firing with all cylinders, singling out the Premier for special attacks.
Speaking at an event to enumerate the two year progress of the government, at Sirikotha, on Monday, the PM lamented the stance of the media to single him out for criticism, although much has been dome by him in terms of developing the economy and ensuring media freedom. He asked the media, though, not to fear and that they will not be white vanned for their trouble, unlike in the past, where journalists were abducted in the dead of the night, tortured and even killed. He said, even though the UNP led national government had achieved a great deal in terms of freedom and economic development he was unreasonably criticized by sections of the media.Is it because we gave journalists the freedom to criticize, and write, that they are constantly attacking us, especially me he queried. In the same vein he asked the media to fear nothing and that his responses will only be verbal, adding that the white van syndrome was a thing of the past.
The Premier also went onto point out how even trade unions have seized on the new found freedom afforded them by the unity government, to stage politically motivated protests, on issues that had nothing to do with their professions, quite a refreshing experience indeed ,considering how these TU leaders were shivering in their pants, when the Rajapaksas were in power.
True, Premier Wickremesinghe may have a justifiable grievance against sections of the media for the undue criticism, specifically targeting him. Certain media houses, particularly the visual media, have been making not so subtle criticism of the Premier, over a period of time, and have gone to the extent of distorting his statements and pronouncements. One TV channel, which makes no bones as to whom it owes its loyalties to, have taken things further. The individual hosting the morning programme giving out the daily newspaper accounts, even makes fun of the comments and statements of the Premier's, often sneeringly. Another channel has reserved its news segment to make frontal attacks on the PM, even introducing special programmes, where, known critics of the Premier are bowled full tosses to obtain the answers that are to the liking of the owners of this channel.
True, the media, in a true democracy, is free to criticize the Prime Minister .US President Donald Trump is still being taken to the cleaners, by sections of western media. There are also TV channels which promote the agenda of politicians, which also is permissible. However, a balance ought to be maintained somewhere along the line. TV channels should not be used as tools to downgrade and vilify a country's prime minister, merely to satisfy the vindictive lust of their owners, who may have lost out on multi billion rupee contacts.
Not just Premier Wickremesinghe. Even President Sirisena has lamented on the conduct of certain media, which he claims were portraying the wrong picture to the general public, while the positives of the government were being blanked out .The President, like the PM, may have a grievance on this score. The divisive nature of the news given on the proposed new constitution, by certain media, is a case in point. While both, the President and PM, had clearly stated that no final document has been hammered out and that the Maha Sangha will be consulted to clarify all doubts, the media are giving weightage to the comments of pro-Rajapaksa bikkhus, that are likely to whip up mass hysteria, leading to a conflagration. This aspect of the picture should be taken into consideration by the authorities and put into operation a counter campaign to allay the fears of the majority community. The President had often complained that the media had failed to present the development programmes undertaken in the country, in a positive sense, to the public. Now, a constitution goni billa is being created in earnest. It is time the government got it's act together and put together an effective mechanism, to combat all myths that its opponents may try to spread, using the services of sections of the media.

Samsungs AddWash washing machine to be launched in SL
Samsung Sri Lanka announces that Samsungs award winning AddWashFront Loading washing machine range is soon to be launched in Sri Lanka.
The innovative features of Samsungs AddWash range have been developed, taking into consideration consumer insights and feedback, which makes the state-of-the-art washing machines the best in its class.
Activities such as adding left-out clothes even after the wash cycle has started, allowing hand washed clothes to go through a spin or rinse cycle and other unique features are available on the Samsung AddWash washing machines.
Furthermore, AddWash washing machines are recognised as the worlds first to incorporate such a feature such as adding laundry even after the wash cycle has commenced, addressing a common consumer pain point identified by Samsung through product innovation. Given the fact that front loader machines normally get locked until the wash cycle is completed, the flexibility to add laundry once the cycle has begun truly fulfills this much-felt consumer demand. The AddWash series from Samsung comes with a secondary door which enables consumers to add laundry in this manner with ease.
Enabling consumers to interact with the washing machine has been a key area of development for Samsung which constantly seeks ways to improve consumer interaction with their products. It also enhances the flexibility offered to consumers in terms of adding detergent, fabric softener etc.
With a digital inverter motor delivering exceptional energy saving benefits and Eco Bubble, the machines are packed with outstanding features such as less noise, durability and long lasting performance.

There is a possibility of the Sri Lanka national team playing more matches in Pakistan in the futurewith the existing level of security, Sri Lanka T20 skipper Thisara Perera said on Tuesday after playing a match at the Gaddafi Stadium for the first time in nine years. The Sri Lanka team was attacked at the same venue (Lahore) in March 2009.
Only three experienced players, including Perera were in the T20 squad and Perera further said that the players were concerned about safety and were able to convince the other players regarding their security. In nine years of my cricket experience this has been the first time that I have seen so much of security Perera said.
The security arrangements in Lahore were excellent and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) gave the assurance of maximum security and the players were highly satisfied with the arrangements Ashley De Silva Chief Executive officer of Sri Lanka Cricket said. De Silva spoke on future tours as the junior squads are to be sent to Pakistan as soon as possible. Our FTP (Future Tours Program) currently has not scheduled any tours for the National team in Pakistan, he said but we intend to send the under 19 team and the A team in time to come.
National Coach Nic Pothas said that the experience gained by the young players in the T20 matches will stand them in good stead in the future and may help them to gain places in the test and ODI squads.

'Sri Lanka needs specialist skills to grow  faster and employ more people'
State Minister for Finance Eran Wickramaratne's comments that the government will cut red tape in issuing visas to fill critical skill gaps is a welcome development as it will help Sri Lankan businesses grow faster, win bigger contracts and employ more people.
Shortages are apparent in several sectors as Sri Lankas labour market with unemployment falling to 4.4 percent in 2016 from 6.5 percent in 2006. Tourism, agriculture and construction sectors are among those complaining. The leisure sector not only needs well-trained workers until domestic training catches up, but also specialists with Chinese language and cooking skills to cater to a sudden influx of tourists from China.
Firms in IT and business process outsourcing (IT/BPO) sector are also finding it difficult to get specialist workers in particular.
The difficulty in getting specialist skills has stifled an entire eco-system of small, medium and start-up companies that are emerging, preventing them from winning bigger contracts and growing faster.
A growing IT sector, where more small companies expand rapidly, or which drawn outside investments, can also help retain some of the most talented IT professionals who are now migrating due to lack of upward career growth.
The tech entrepreneurs who are complaining of skills shortages are also IT professionals.
Fear psychosis
The proposal to streamline the process of sourcing labour from overseas has triggered a protest from one group of IT workers.
Though it is understandable that these workers fear that they may lose jobs, IT workers-turned SME entrepreneurs say there is not enough awareness in the country about the dynamics of the market, which is fast changing and how cutting red tape will bring benefits for everyone including workers themselves.
Those chasing short term gains and protection will not only deny an opportunity for Sri Lanka to grow, but may also hurt themselves in the long term, by denying opportunities for career growth. Meanwhile other countries are not standing still. Countries like Vietnam, which are more open in multiple ways, is already ahead of Sri Lanka in the BPO game and is overtaking others.
Past experience has shown that clearing bottlenecks and removing roadblocks can unleash growth and employment.
Sri Lanka's IT service sector got a firmer foothold in the global market in the 1990s when the then telecom minister broke a monopoly held by Sri Lanka Telecom by introducing competition. An international voice and data monopoly was broken a few years later, ending another protection afforded to SLT, cutting costs and making the IT sector competitive. Though Sri Lanka Telecom lost market share, its business is now part of a bigger pie and the firm is better positioned deal with competition from services such as Viber and WhatsApp. The entire country also has access to cheaper telephony and faster data services. Many people have found work in businesses connected to the telecom sector.
The fee levying Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) was also set up in the late 1990s, partly with the intermediation of the Board of Investment, giving economic freedoms to many students who would otherwise have been hurt by a roadblock in the form of a taxpayer-funded state monopoly in IT degrees. At the time there was no government IT Officers Association, like in the medical sector or any such body to prevent these freedoms from being given to the students and the country, after resistance from Sri Lanka Telecom was dealt with.
It is therefore important to understand the issues and dynamics at play in the software and IT market, particularly in the small, medium and start-up sector, and why tech entrepreneurs want foreign specialists to grow faster.
Skills gap
The Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies (SLASSCOM) says about 3,000 students qualify from state universities each year. Reliable estimates are unavailable of private sector output or migration. The best graduates are snapped up by the largest players. Some are also absorbed by firms catering to the domestic market. Some qualify in hardware and networking areas.
But it is a fact that large companies like Google and Microsoft who employ a 1,000 or more workers in a location are not coming to Sri Lanka. The IT/BPO industry is estimated to employ around 80,000 people of various disciplines. Understandably, existing industry players may also be comfortable with this situation as the entry of any big name can lead to poaching and a steep rise in wages.
The problem of attracting large tech companies who need a large volume of labour is one side of the coin. The lack of specialist skills is another one. Given that Sri Lanka is a small market students tend to go on a more general route. It may not make economic sense to go for additional qualifications especially when it is quite easy to get a well-paid job with expertise in general areas.
But the industry is changing fast and new skills are needed. At one time a programming language like Python may be 'hot'. At another time there may a shortfall of good User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX) specialists, who will design and build the front end of an application so that users can do their work easily and with as less training as possible.
The list goes on, and it changes rapidly.
Unleashing the SME ecosystem
Industry watchers say there is a trend where entrepreneurial software engineers with several years of experience under their belt, are setting up small outfits to cater to the international market. They have knowhow, some management skills and customer relationships to work with foreign clients.
For a small company, getting the right mix of specialist skills is not easy, especially when requirements change rapidly.
For example, a Sri Lankan SME bidding for a contract in Europe may require 30 software engineers, but the client asks for five certified usability testers. Another deal may require five qualified data scientists. The company may have 25 staff, but lack the five specialists. They will have to give up the job, when specialists are not available even if the client firm is willing to engage them.
Sometimes such talent may be available from a larger company, but poaching them at high prices may make the bid unviable. Due to the lack of specialist skills, many SME founders say they are now hitting a roadblock.
IT entrepreneur say that Indian or Filipino developers are not necessarily cheaper to employ than Sri Lankans, while living costs in Sri Lanka are also higher than countries like India.
lack of career growth
A fast growing industry will also help reduce the migration of seasoned professionals, which is a big problem dogging the industry.
Currently, IT professionals who gain experience and reach lower management level find that there is not enough opportunities for career growth due to the slow expansion of the industry.
By the time a tech professional gains mid-level experience, the salary gap between Sri Lanka and other markets widens. With limited options at home, these professionals migrate.
If the industry grows faster, more experienced IT professionals will remain in the country. By opposing measures that may make an industry grow faster a section of IT workers may be denying themselves and their colleagues' opportunities for career growth.
Lagging behind
As it happened with products exports, there are fears that Sri Lanka is lagging behind, though the country may have been a pioneer in removing the first state controls.
In the Global Services Locations Index compiled by AT Kearney, Vietnam was ranked 19th in the world in 2007, with a People Skills and Availability score of 0.99 points. Sri Lanka was only slightly behind with a score of 0.96.
By 2017, Vietnam had moved to sixth place, overtaking the Philippines. Vietnam had radically improved its score in People Skills and Availability to 1.39. Sri Lanka's score in the People Skills and Availability sub-index had only improved to 1.07 points.
Philippines had been a leader in East Asia due to its English ability. Vietnam had an early start serving the Japanese market but big Western firms are now moving in. AT Kearney noted that a "significant percentage of the predominantly young Vietnamese population is now fluent in English."
Young Vietnamese are learning English quickly due to a booming formal and informal private education system staffed with teachers from the US, UK and Australia who are moving to the country easily.
Clearing roadblocks
The start-up boom and the wide adoption of software in the local market offers hope. But it can be realized by being open to investment and talent.
When more Sri Lankans work with specialists, they will also acquire some of the know-how as knowledge diffusion occurs faster when people move.
SLASSCOM, the industry body, has recommended that a programme be launched to attract diaspora and international knowledge workers, a non-resident type dual citizen scheme be introduced and easier visa and work-permit process for knowledge workers similar to an existing programme to attract regional headquarters of global companies to Sri Lanka be offered.
Sri Lanka should not just think about clearing red tape for easier sourcing of specialist skills as the government plans, but move beyond and think about a structured skilled visa programme along the lines of other countries that are technology hubs.
Other countries are moving even further. Thailand recently announced a four-year 'smart visa' for business professionals without the need for a work permit.
Sri Lanka plans to be a service hub for the Indian Ocean. These lofty goals cannot be reached without quick access to knowledge workers who will in turn impart their knowledge to Sri Lankans.

Sri lanka, Qatar to boost trade
In his closing statements following two days of trade talks between Sri Lanka and Qatar, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said it was time to take a fresh look at trade relations between the two countries.
The level of trade between our two countries has not been very impressive over the last years, he said, citing that two-way trade fell from US$ 48 million in 2015 to US$ 45 million in 2016.
Delegates from Sri Lanka and Qatar held trade talks at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel on Monday and Tuesday, as the second session of the Sri Lanka-Qatar Joint Committee on Economic, Commercial and Technical Cooperation. The meetings come at a time of tension for Qatar, as the country faces a diplomatic freeze from its Gulf neighbors, led by Saudi Arabia.
As you all know the meetings of this committee comes in the wake of the illegal blockage imposed by the neighbouring countries, which aims to undermine the stance of the State of Qatar as an economically independent and sovereign nation, said Sheikh Ahmed bin Jassim bin Mohammad Al Thani, the Qatari Minister of Economy and Commerce. But both leaders said the discussions held economic potential for the two countries.
Minister Bathiudeen said that the discussions were fruitful and resulted in many positive outcomes, specifically for the power and energy, aviation, hospitality, industry, and agriculture sectors.
We look forward, through this committee, to find mechanisms to increase the volume of trade between our two countries, Sheikh Al Thani said.
President Maithripala Sirisena also visited Qatar on an official visit last week, where he met with its Emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.

STATUS QUO FOR BUDDHISM TO REMAIN
Constitutional lawyer and MP Dr Jayampathy Wickramaratne proposed changing the controversial definition of Sri Lanka in the Interim Report to Republic of Sri Lanka for clarity.
The MP was opening the Constitutional Assembly debate for the second day yesterday.
Dr. Wickramaratne pointed out the two clauses proposed by the Steering Committee to Article 9 of the Constitution have granted foremost place to Buddhism and have specifically stated that it is the duty of the State to protect and foster the BuddhaSasana.
Observing that some people have raised concerns over using Sri Lanka instead of Republic of Sri Lanka in the Interim Report, Dr Wickramaratne clarified that the report at the outset has clearly mentioned that Sri Lanka is a free, sovereign and independent Republic. However, to allay suspicion in this regard, I propose changing it to Republic of Sri Lanka in the draft Constitution, he said.
The MP stressed that there is no proposal of secession in the Interim Report and it has clear provisions against secession which even the existing Constitution does not provide.
No Provincial Council can declare any part of the territory of Sri Lanka to be a separate State or even speak in favour of secession. Moreover, it has the provision for the Centre to take over some or full powers of the Governor, Chief Minister, Provincial Cabinet of Ministers and other provincial authorities if any Provincial Council deliberately contravenes the Constitution or promote armed riots, he added.
Commenting on the ekiya rajya, Dr Wickramaratne said if the translation orumiththa nadu does not best reflect the meaning of ekiya rajya, a better word could be proposed.
It means a State which is undivided and indivisible, he stated. He said the only power taken away from the Governors is the power to override the Provincial Public Service Commission.
This was done as per the request of all Provincial Chief Ministers, he explained.

Thoughts found in words
Shifting gradually from his earliest mainstay of interest in the theatrical activities with emphasis on make up and other behind-the-stage activities, but not entirely abandoned, the veteran writer, poet, short story writer, Buddhadasa Galappatty has taken more time devoted to poetry and Sinhala column writing.
To the best of my knowledge, Buddhi, as he is known to us, is one person who reads almost all the Sinhala poems that appear in the book market. Most of the Sinhala poems that come out are not only read by Buddhi, but takes pains writing a regular column titled as Kavi Mihira which appear in a Sinhala daily.
He takes care to read them and picks out the best in order to introduce them to fellow readers. The Kavi Mihira is now collected in the form of anthologies. This year marks the appearance of the third volume which runs to a bulky 396-page work.
Social media
In this volume of poems there are 72 poets. All of them are newcomers to the creative field. There are three main areas that are touched by Buddhi. Firstly the picking process presumably is one of the hardest as it is not only a printed selection but also the social media where a lot of poetry is exhibited as pioneer skills. Secondly come the author publications which reach him regularly.
Thirdly are the appearances of the early or the more known poets out of which he picks his choice giving vent to the more social significance. Perhaps this area is the most controversial area, as it lingers on to the element of ideological preference than anything else. When all is said and done this is an arduous task where there are overridings and competitions. Sinhala poetry today has come to stay as one of the overpowering creativities in the literary scene.
But most of them go unnoticed. Unlike in most other countries, some of them never get translated either into English or to any other language despite the merits they hold. Buddhi is noticeable about the matter and he feels that some of these modern day Sinhala poems ought to be translated.
Some of the finest poems as picked up by Buddhi come from the poets like Anurasiri Hettige, Subhashini Dharmaratne, Ajith Nishantha, Upul Senadhirige, Anuradha Nilmini, Kumara Hettiarachchi, Narmada Wickramaarachchi, Troy Mahamohottala, Sunita Koswatta and Liyanage Amarakirti.
Controversial point
I felt a certain degree of freshness on seeing these poems lined up as an anthology. But to what degree at extent to which they are discussed at large could be a controversial point. This anthology has faced upheavals as a commodity meant to mark the annual book fair at the State Literary Festival. Most poems come as debut create works that need the support from some social sector. But it is clearly observed that compilers of the calibre of Buddhi, try hard to promote the dictum of Mao Tse Tung, which meant as let thousand flowers bloom. The same could be said about the poetic conventions. I see that though they are overpoured.
The discussion and the critical evaluations are a drawback. Even at the school level most teachers of literature find it difficult to go beyond the prescribed text which is compiled in haste and unmethodically. This has been lingering on for some time.
Contemporary eye
Buddhi too has brought out his column titled as Edawasa Sondurumaya, one I received in the fourth volume, packed with varying types of reminiscences, notes, short profiles, and belles letter cum nostalgic material.
I felt that this is not only one way securing the writings of a person who is wide awakened to the socio-political nuances, but also a series of contemporary eye openers to the more latent perspectives of the day.
All in all, I felt that Buddhis collections contributions to daily papers and journal never go wasted.

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said that those who threatened to set the House on fire, could not be allowed to stifle democracy.
Speaker Jayasuriya reprimanded Joint Opposition MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Keheliya Rambukwella and Prasanna Ranaweera for trying to shout Constitutional lawyer and MP Dr.Jayampathy Wickramaratne down and disturb his speech repeatedly.
As Dr.Wickramaratne took the floor opening the Constitutional Assembly debate for the second day, the JO MPs repeatedly disturbed him asking for opportunities to raise a Point of Order.
The MP declined to allow the JO MPs take his time and tried to continue his speech.
Speaker Jayasuriya asked the JO MPs to raise their concerns in the time slot allocated to them, adding that the MP must not be disturbed. MPs Dinesh Gunawardena, Keheliya Rambukwella and Prasanna Ranaweera defying the Speakers order made a din in the House.
The Speaker, at this point, noted those who threatened to set the House on fire could not be allowed to stifle democracy in this manner. Every MP has the right to speak and it is my duty to safeguard this right. All of you will be given time, dont disturb others. If you cannot conduct yourself properly then leave the House, he warned.
As MP Gunawardena yelled at the Speaker saying it is a shame, the Speaker retorted that he was ashamed to see the mean conduct of senior Parliamentarians.
Dr. Wickramaratne however managed to continue his speech amidst continuous disturbances.

In that years Battle of the Blues he was bowled out for a duck, but he held the match-winning catch.
He had his primary education at Bishops College, Colombo Late J.R. Jayewardene, who was always known as J. R. led the Royal rugby team in 1924 and was a fine line-out specialist and played in the company of V.C. Batholomuesz, W.L. Siebel, R.F.C. Schrader, E. D. de Silva, E.F. Don, C.D.R. Bastian, K.S.

Interestingly during this period Trinity had a number of overseas students in their rugby team from England, France, Uganda, Burma and China.
JR was also a top-class footballer and played as centre-half, and was the vice-captain of the Royal College team. He was a fine boxer and a tennis player. J.R. always gave a big hand for sports. As a keen cricketer and ruggerite he often visited Kandy to play against Trinity College, in the 1920s. JRs name was extremely popular among the Royalists not because he participated in numerous sports disciplines but for his outstanding contributions.
His pet sport was cricket and he gave the game a prominent place in his life and went on to become one of the most honored presidents of the Cricket Board. He gave cricket a prominent place. When Sri Lanka gained Test status in 1982 he was the head of the country.

In 1988, the J.R Jayewardene Centre was established by the J.R Jayewardene Centre at the childhood home of J. R. at Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo. It served as an archive for J.R Jayewardene's personal library and papers as well as records from the Presidential Secretariat and gifts he received during his tenure as President. Although J.R.

Tamil prisoners on hunger strike
Viggy urges former President Kumaratunga to intervene
Northern Provincial Council Chief Minister C. V. Vigneswaran has written to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga appealing for assistance in transferring the cases of three Tamil prisoners on hunger strike, from the Anuradhapura High Court to the Vavuniya High Court.
Vigneswaran had asked the former President to intervene in favour of the prisoners who had been fasting for the last 37 days.
The three prisoners, Rajathurai Thiruvarul, Mathiarasan Sulakshan and Ganeshan Dharshan last week filed an appeal in the Court of Appeal against the Attorney General and the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID).
The prisoners state that they were arrested by the TID and produced before the Magistrate before being committed to fiscal custody. They also revealed that they were remanded in various prisons and are at present being detained in the Anuradhapura Prison. In 2013, they were indicted by the Attorney General in the Vavuniya High Court and their case was called on 58 instances without a trial being initiated. In 2017 September, the Vavuniya High Court Judge fixed the case for trial for two days but thereafter, the AG had moved to transfer the case to the Anuradhapura High Court.
The prisoners complain that they do not have relatives or friends in Anuradhapura and that they speak only Tamil, making it hard for them to understand the proceedings in another language.
They pointed out that they would be thus denied a fair trial in Anuradhapura and drew attention to the fact that out of the 67 witnesses in the case, 64 were from the Police and Armed Forces.

## Title: What is the lifestyle of Canadian Tamils

What is the lifestyle of Canadian Tamils
In North America, in Canada, there are many people from Lanka, Tamil Nadu and other countries. They speak an ancient (about 21 centuries ago) but a contemporary language called Tamil.
The Tamils from all parts of Lanka, north, east, central, Uva and west have gone to live in Canada for various reasons. This had been happening for phe last half a century. Majority of them are from the Jaffna peninsula. They are now Canadian citizens wherever they come from. A handful of them must be having dual citizenship of both Lanka and Canada.
Such people produce literature and films in their mother language which is Tamil. Although they are now reckoned as Canadian Tamils, what they produce as literature as
Pulam Peyar Ilaakiyam (literature produced by the uprooted people) by some Lankan newspapers and magazines, just because many of them write about their experiences during the ethnic war situations in Lanka. However, even if they write about their Lankan experiences what they write cannot be called Lankan Tamil Literature. In fact they should be categorized as Canadian Tamil Literature.
Respective countries
Similarly there is Tamil Literature from citizens from countries like Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Britain, Australia and New Zealand and South India. Although the writers may have come from Lanka what they produce belongs to the literature of the respective countries and they are no more Lankan Tamil Literature.This fact is forgotten by Lankan Tamil commentators. So, to my mind Pulam Peyar Ilakkiyam is a misnomer. Let that be.
A well-researched book by a former academic from Jaffna University and now a Canadian citizen, Prof Ilaiyathamby Balasundaram is an original and first of its kind work. This 518-page book printed in Toronto on gloss paper by Swami Vipulananthar Tamil Research Center in 2017 can be called a Magnum Opus.
It is a book in Tamil titled as Canadaavil ilankaith thamilarin vaalvum varalaarum. (Lankan Tamils Life and History in Canada). Under 11 topics, the writer gives comprehensive and valuable information on his chosen title. In a short review like this, it is impossible to comment on his admirable content. Most matter is new to me. Although I have been to Toronto - only on two occasions - I wouldnt know much about Canadian Tamils. So I shall list the subjects of his book that may interest readers to buy and enjoy the book. They are listed in Tamil. I translate those into English.
1. Canadian Tamils entry into the country: a historical view.
2. Education for new immigrants in Canada.
3. The Status of Tamil in Canada.
4. Tamil Culture and prevailing of such culture in Canada.
5. Canadian Tamil Literature and Studies in Tamilogy.
6. The greatness in Science and Semantics of the Canadian Tamils.
7. The activities of Tamil Media in Canada.
8. The political activities of Canadian Tamils.
9. The lifestyle of senior citizens and Generation Gap.
10. Associations for the arts, literature and culture in Canada.
11. Conclusion
Tamil contributions
Apart from the main test, the book includes a bibliography of researched books and literary materials.
There are also indexes on Saiva Temples in Canada Catholic Tamil Prayer Churches, Tamil Radio Stations in Ontario, Tamil newspapers published in Canada, Tamil magazines published in Canada, books published by the Tamil Media in Canada, Tamil websites in Canada and Tamil Films produced in Canada.Prof Fr Joseph Chandrakanthan in his evaluation of the book says it is a good guide for other Tamils in other parts of the world to record their contributions in Tamil and this book is serious social document that is comprehensive.
In his Preface, Prof E Balasundaram details his painstaking effort that started in 2005 and thanks all those who assisted him in this praiseworthy undertaking.
This book deserves to be made available in all libraries and universities and research institutions.

Win in the wilderness
Photography as a subject is one of the most interesting activities being followed by countless people around us, irrespective of what equipment they utilize. Photography in itself captures a moment for a lifetime and captivates our imagination through images. Images, irrespective of theme or substance, acquire the power to control our lives and even change it many ways.
Sri Lanka is bountiful in terms of professional photographers who go the extra mile in bringing stillness to everyday life and there are amateurs who showcase amazing captures whilst diminishing the ideal that a photographer needs fancy equipment to get the job done. It really all has to do with an eye for detail and even better, for that right moment in time. Be it photography in fashion, landscape, aerial, wildlife or sports, Sri Lanka has it all.
Were here to talk about not just the amazing flare that goes into delivering a picture but to discuss about the amazing level of consistency and ambition one special Sri Lankan wildlife photographer has displayed in the course of one year. A unique attribute he holds no doubt in comparison to a few other wildlife photographers is the fact that he had only been active as a Wildlife Photographer for a little over two years and has managed to compete in a number of photography competitions globally and won 252 awards and recognitions! We met up with Lakshitha Karunarathna, one of Sri Lankas most recognized wildlife photographers and sat down to find out how he got to achieve this in so little, a time.
Photography was not in the cards for me growing up. I would say that I was more of an observer and this extended to aspects of nature and wildlife. I was always fixated with documentaries that were so hard to find during my younger days. These came in VHS and were not found freely, even in Colombo at the time. My biggest inspiration was British broadcaster and naturalist, Sir David Attenborough. Over time, I collected nature related documentaries and built a huge library. I was more of a wildlife enthusiast and later on decided to work on acquiring my own collection of originals and updating my database, Lakshitha said.
It was a recent progression into wildlife photography for him, having commenced in 2014. His interest in photography spiked when he witnessed his wedding photographer interacting with him and his bride during their wedding photo shoot. Our wedding photographer was Rasanga Dissanayake.
He was simply a very creative and interactive photographer and a joy to work with. He was constantly keeping us engaged and he kept explaining to me the process he embraced and he simply inspired me to try my hand at photography, he reminisced.
Lakshitha eventually travelled to Dubai and bought himself a camera sans the lenses. Coming back to Sri Lanka, he got himself few third-party lenses. He added that more than focusing on how expensive the equipment should be, he simply made use of available resources and gradually started with Bird Photography.
Along the way, he made contacts from the wildlife photographic fraternities in the country and made friends along the way. Many of them provided him with good feedback and some encouraged him to try out competitions.
Lakshitha added, My style of photography extended towards capturing photos that evolved with out of the box creativity. I believe that was one of the main ingredients which helped me secure 252 awards in less than a year since I began entering photography competitions. I had managed to secure a number of awards from well-known competitions such as 40th Taipei International (Taiwan), 2017 DVF Photo Cup (Germany), 60th Maitland International (Australia), 37th Northern Counties International (England), 51st Oklahoma International (USA) & 92nd Zaragoza International (Spain)  To date, he has won 79 Gold, 20 Silver and 24 Bronze Medals and over 129 other awards which includes Blue Ribbons, Honourable Mentions, Judges Choices and Merits totalling it to over 250 awards in all, from 35 countries.

Woods announces return to action in November
Los Angeles: Tiger Woods will make his latest return from long-term injury at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas next month, the former world number one confirmed on Monday.
The 14-time major champion has not played since February after a recurrence of back problems which forced him to miss the 2015-2016 season.
"I am excited to return to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge," said Woods, who also made his last comeback at the tournament in Albany which benefits his charity foundation.
Woods is included in an 18-man field which features many of world golf's elite, including world number one Dustin Johnson and world number two Jordan Spieth.Woods has not played a competitive round since firing a 77 in the first round of the Dubai Desert Classic in February.
Woods withdrew from the event the next day and underwent another back operation in April, his fourth back surgery in all, that sidelined him for the remainder of the season.
Since then Woods has posted videos during his battle to regain fitness, most recently footage of him firing a "stinger" shot with a long iron.
During his latest injury layoff, Woods served as a US team assistant captain at the Presidents Cup last month where said he was uncertain if he would ever return to competitive golf.
The golf superstar has also battled demons in his private life, and was arrested for driving under the influence in May after being found asleep in his Mercedes-Benz by the side of the road near his home in Florida. Woods, who was found to have five drugs including the powerful opioid hydrocodone in his system, later revealed he underwent professional treatment to help him manage his medications.
Woods last week pleaded guilty to reckless driving following the May incident.
Under a plea agreement reached in Palm Beach County, north of Miami, Woods will avoid jail time unless he commits major violations of his probation.
The plea deal requires Woods to spend one year on probation, pay a $250 fine, perform 50 hours' community service, and complete "DUI (driving under the influence) school".
Woods, whose 79 career PGA Tour wins are three shy of Sam Snead's all-time record, has not won a major title since the 2008 US Open and has not won any event since the 2013 World Golf Championships Bridgestone Invitational. AFP

Young Yevan finishes in top 16 at IAME World Karting Finals
Yevan David, a 10-year-old Sri Lankan born up and coming racing star who currently based in Singapore, finished in the top 16 at the IAME World Karting Finals 2017 held in France, amidst mechanical problems during the qualifying session.
The IAME World Finals were held earlier this month at the Le Mans International Karting Circuit in France with 400 of the world's top drivers vying for honours.
This was the first time that IAME invited Mini drivers (8-12 years) to participate in the event by winning their home championship titles. Mini Drivers from Europe, North America, South America, Russia, Middle East and Asia took part in the finals in France. Yevan, having won the championship for South East Asia, qualified to represent Asia at this prestigious event.
The grid was competitive and Yevan had the pace to be in the top 10 throughout Practices.
Unfortunately during qualifying, his kart had a mechanical fault and he could only qualified 33rd from 36. In the heats that followed, he fought his way up to finish 20, 24 and 30 from 36, the final place being the result of having to avoid another driver who had crashed and spinning out.
After starting 27th in the pre-final, Yevan fought his way forward to finish 21st.
The final proved to be a hard fought race which was red flagged four laps in due to a crash and Yevan battled to finish in 16th place.
The result also puts him in the top 16 drivers for his age group in the world.
He will now race in Singapore and Thailand for the rest of the year but will be racing on his home soil, Sri Lanka in January 2018 at the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit in Bandaragama where he started karting, at the inaugural X30 race in Sri Lanka.
