Good Intern Doctor programme axed
The state sponsorship and funds allocated for the programme 'Good Intern Doctor' organized by the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA), has been curtailed this year due to an act of sabotage, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo recently, he said that the former health minister (current president), Maithripala Sirisena offered both state sponsorship and funds for the programme, but now unfortunately, the Health Ministry has extended its fullest support to a group of persons who are trying their best to sabotage the programme.
According to Dr. Aluthge, the GMOA conducted this programme very successfully every year and even amidst any hazard, the GMOA will go ahead and conduct the programme successfully. The programme is aimed at improving the quality and standards of the health service.
The programme has three main sections. They are Native Language Training Programme, Skills Training Programme (re-training doctors with the assistance of the College of Anaesthetists and College of Physicians in order to function as a resident doctor) and Good Intern Workshop.
The Communication Skills Training Programme is one of the key topics discussed during the programme, he added.

10 great cricketers : who were terrible fielders
Cricket has seen its fair share of decidedly below average to poor fielders in international cricket over the years.
Many of the most gifted cricketers in the world have been found wanting when it comes to the discipline of fielding. Had it not been for their considerable prowess in one or more disciplines of the game, they would not have been able to make it. Here is a look at 10 of them.
10 SOURAV GANGULY
Former Indian captain and one of the world's leading one day opening batsman in his day, Sourav Ganguly, may have won many games for his team but as far as fielding was concerned he was a bit of a liability.
Ganguly wasn't that bad a catcher and in fact, grew to be a pretty safe catcher as time went by but he was an extremely slow mover in the field and cost the team runs in almost every game.
His diving was awkward and he did not attempt that too often, while his attempts to chase shots to the boundary were almost always unsuccessful.
He was a perilious catcher during the early years of his career as well, but he gradually improved.
9 LASITH MALINGA
If one is asked to name a few bowlers, who have redefined death bowling in limited overs cricket then Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga will figure somewhere near the top of such a list.
He has been instrumental in Sri Lanka's success over the past decade or so but when it comes to fielding, he has often been found to be an erratic and unpredictable fielder, much like his bowling.
Malinga is quite quick and he can dive as well when he so wishes but his catching often leaves a lot to be desired.
Obviously, he does not drop catches in every game but quite often his positioning or judgement of the trajectory of the ball is found wanting and had it not been for his immense abilities as a bowler, he would not have played international cricket for this long.
8 SHOAIB AKHTAR
One of Pakistan's greatest modern bowlers and the fastest bowler in the world during his peak was not always much of an asset on the field.
Akhtar wasn't a bad athlete by any stretch of the imagination, otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to fashion that legendary run up that generated all that pace.
However, on the field, he did not always seem to be up for it when it came to chasing down fours or running a lot to cut down runs. In the process, he became a liability for Pakistan, at a time when fielding standards all over the world were improving at a frightening pace.
7 JAVAGAL SRINATH
For a period stretching over more than a decade, Javagal Srinath was one of the world's better fast bowlers and India's pace spearhead. There is no doubt that he is one of India's greatest fast bowlers and at the same time, probably one of the poorer fielders that the team had to accommodate in its recent history.
Srinath, like most fast bowlers, fielded at third man or long leg and while he was a safe catcher, it was his ability to cover ground that left a lot to be desired.
Following his shoulder injury, he had to alter his throwing technique and that made his throws from the deep a loopy one. Batsmen often ran twos when the ball went to him in the deep.
6 MORNE MORKEL
South Africans are generally known for being excellent fielders, however, their 6 feet 5 fast bowler Morne Morkel is a notable exception to the rule.
Over the years, he has been one of the best fast bowlers in the world but as a fielder, he has been a liability for the side for quite some time. Morkel is not a swift mover by any stretch and in addition to that, owing to his towering frame it is often tough for him to get down quickly.
That often leads to South Africa conceding unnecessary runs and last but not the least, he is not always a reliable catcher either. He often makes simple catches look difficult and that is often the attribute of a poor fielder.
5 GLENN MCGRATH
With a tally of 563 Test wickets and 381 one day international wickets, Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath is one of the greatest to have ever played the game. However, in all other attributes of the game, he was a complete liability.
McGrath's batting was strictly that of a tailender while his fielding was another thorn in the flesh for the Australian team.
He was the worst fielder in the Australian side of his time, and one of his biggest failings was perhaps his inability to cover ground while fielding at the deep. Although he was a reliable catcher, there was not much else to be praised about his fielding.
4 ARJUNA RANATUNGA
Former Sri Lankan captain and without a doubt, one of their most influential players ever, took the cricket team to new heights and is still regarded as an iconic cricketer.
However, the portly Arjuna Ranatunga often found it difficult to excel on the field to the same degree that he did as a captain or batsman.
Ranatunga was not a particularly disastrous fielder and in fact, he was a pretty safe catcher but he was often found wanting when a piece of fielding was dependent on movement or running. In the same vein, Ranatunga was also a notable run out candidate throughout his cricket career.
3 RAVICHANDRAN ASHWIN
India's off-spinning ace is well on his way to becoming one of the greatest spinners to have ever represented the country and his prowess as a batsman had also seen him climb to the top of the ICC rankings for Test all-rounders.
Despite his obvious excellence as a cricketer, it is perhaps his fielding that weighs him down a bit and at a time when global fielding standards are higher than ever before, Ashwin's struggles as a fielder stand out.
Ashwin is quite slow when he is supposed to move quickly and chasing balls heading for the boundary is often a struggle for him. On the other hand, he might know how to dive but his diving technique is often found to be thoroughly ineffective. That said, he is a safe catcher and hardly ever drops anything.
2 SAEED AJMAL
Before his bowling action practically ended his career in international cricket, Pakistan off-spinner Saeed Ajmal was perhaps the best spinner in the world and on his way to becoming one of Pakistan's greats.
As a fielder though, he was often comically bad and had it not been for his superlative skills as a bowler, he would have found himself out of the team immediately.
Ajmal couldn't run fast, nor could he be relied upon to stop everything that came his way and last but not the least, most team-mates held their breath whenever he found himself underneath a catch. That said, his excellence as a bowler completely overshadowed his shortcomings as a fielder.
1 INZAMAM-UL-HAQ
Former Pakistan great Inzamam-ul-Haq will go down in history as one of his nation's finest batsmen and in fact, he was among the best in the world during his career.
However, when it came to anything remotely to do with athleticism or hard running, Inzamam was often found wanting and it was not only restricted to his running between the wickets.
As a fielder, he was never really in any mood to exert himself in any way and while he was a safe catcher, bowlers could never depend on him to make an extra effort to stop shots that went either side of him.
Had he not been such a high-class batsmen, it is unlikely that his comical fielding would have been tolerated.  sk

BEYOND THE RHETORIC: STRIVING TO UNITE IN DIVERSITY
Our nation comprises many races, each with a culture and a history of its own. It is for us to blend all that is best in us, and to set ourselves with the resolute will to build up that high quality, and to join with the other nations of the world in establishing peace, security and justice for all people - D S Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, on February 4, 1948
For the first time in our 70 years post-independence history, all our parties have had a stake in Constitution-making exercise voicing their fears and aspirations loud and clear. True, there is little consensus, and still more leagues to tread to see some light at the end of the tunnel, but the multi-party involvement it receives is heartening to note.
The debate on Constitutional Reforms, during which Parliament convened as Constitutional Assembly, saw the active participation of the UNP, SLFP, JVP, TNA, other minor parties and even the Joint Opposition group. Two more days were added to the initial three-day arrangement for the debate as many were eager to take the floor and place their views on record.
The debate kicked-off at a time when the new Constitution has become a topic in the popular dialogue. Reminding the quote, A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes (English preacher Charles Spurgeon), the analysts pointed out the popular perception on draft proposals was largely driven by half-baked truths, misinformation and misinterpretation of the content.
Democratic dialogue
The debate opened up a healthy dialogue on thorny areas related to the Constitution. It provided a platform for all parties to articulate their positions and lobby for what they stand for. The SLFP and Jathika Hela Urumaya stood their ground on retaining the Executive Presidency while the JVP and some in the UNP insisted on its abolition.
The TNA aspired for a federal solution within an undivided and indivisible country but was willing to consider any agreement the two main parties accept. This was an unprecedented stand the TNA has taken under the leadership of R Sampanthan with the earnest desire to hammer out a final solution for national question.
The JO flatly rejected the Interim Report and wanted the entire exercise be abandoned right away on the grounds that it endangers the unitary character of the State and foremost place for Buddhism. This was despite the repeated assurances by the Government that the ekeeya rajya and foremost place for Buddhism will be intact in the new Constitution.
Political football
The JOs has been an approach of running with the hare and hunting with the hounds when it comes to constitution-making effort. They involved in every step of the process so far from unanimously adopting the Resolution to presenting the Sub-Committee and Steering Committee reports. Two JO stalwarts MPs Dinesh Gunawardena and Prasanna Ranatunga were overwhelmingly appreciated for their active participation in the Steering Committee deliberations all throughout. But outside Parliament the JO fiercely led a No campaign against a new Constitution instilling fears of secession in the minds of people in the Southern polity.
The JO members however were unable to quote any harmful proposal in the Interim Report to shore up their claims. Many argued that the JO opposed for the sake of opposing turning a blind eye to many progressive features in the report. JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake commented that the JO was using the report as a political football to bag more votes at the upcoming Local Government polls.
Finding a common ground
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, in yet another attempt to engage with the JO constructively, went on to read out the JOs observations in the Interim Report point by point, making it clear that reaching an agreement on most of them will not be difficult. He invited them to keep aside the political slogans, come to grips with the issue that led to war and help resolve it amicably.
We in the Government are on the same page with you on many of these proposals, the TNA is not disagreeing and the JVP agrees. What more you want Why do you disagree now Lets sit at a roundtable and discuss how we can reach a consensus, he told the JO.
We will consider all the proposals. Nothing has been finalized. The process will stretch out beyond April. This report only contains reflections of Steering Committee deliberations so far. We are not yet into drafting the bill. The prime objective of this debate is to consult the views of all, the PM said allaying fears of imposing a new Constitution on the country overnight.
Arguments and counter-arguments
Minister Mangala Samaraweera, TNA MP M A Sumanthiran, State Minister Dilan Perera, known for their moderate views, were among those who well-exploited the debate to dispel the public misconceptions, counter-argue the JOs claims, and assert the importance and true spirit of the proposals made.
Minister Samaraweera, who took the floor after UPFA MP Dullas Alahapperuma, reminded the House how MP Alahaperuma together with colleagues Dilan Perera and late Nalanda Ellawala went from village to village campaigning for a new Constitution under the Sudu Nelum Movement started in 1995.
The draft Constitution that MP Alahapperuma then campaigned for was a far more progressive one in terms of power sharing compared to what we have proposed today. That draft Bill did not contain the word unitary but united. It even facilitated police and land powers to the Provincial Councils, he turned tables on the MP.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas election manifesto that promised to lay down a procedure similar to what is being followed today to make a new Constitution, his inaugural address at the All Party Representative Committee (APRC) in 2006 during which he advocated for maximum possible devolution of power, his undertaking to fully implement the 13th Amendment and even go beyond that, were cited at many a times by legislators to expose the diametrically opposite stand Rajapaksa and his allies have taken today.
The inability of leaders to stand by what they accept and keep to their commitments even after they cease to hold power has been a major setback in the country, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan noted while quoting at length several past statements by Rajapaksa.
Former President Rajapaksa, who spoke in the debate on the fourth day, criticized the attempt to bring in a new Constitution as a conspiracy and called for conscience votes on it. Observing that he had been overwhelmingly quoted over the past three days said his was an attempt to unite the country and not divide it.
Reflective thoughts
State Minister Dilan Pereras 40 minutes speech was frankly retrospective of the past mistakes committed and the many opportunities Sri Lanka as a nation missed. Dont miss the last bus, he warned while pleading all parties to be willing to compromise to resolve the national question once and forever. Remember, the TNA after Sampanthan would hardly agree to include the word ekeeya and offer Buddhism the foremost place. Lets grasp this golden opportunity. We got this problem from our fathers as they could not solve it within their lifetime. Even we are gradually getting old now. Are we going to pass this burden to our sons, he asked.
With the dates set for the LG polls, the delicate process of Constitution-making is at the risk of being exploited as a political battle-cry. The window of opportunity unlocked in January 2015 to hammer out a deal cutting cross party lines is becoming narrow, but hopes continue. Whither are we bound if we miss the last bus

Four time International Masters champions Colombo Veterans will be aiming to win the championship for the fifth time as they boast of some of the best former national and club players. But it wont be as easy as a team from football fame England will be participating for the first time this year and they will be a tough side to beat. Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, Mauritius, former champions Singapore, South Africa, UAE, and hosts India are the other nations that will field veteran teams.
The teams will be divided into two groups and the first round will be played on a league basis and the two group leaders will play each other in the final to determine the champion.

This year too Colombo Veterans FC will field almost the same team that won the International Soccer Masters Tournament under the theme of Goodwill Soccer Festival in Dubai last year.Due to inclement weather Colombo Veterans FC players are finding it difficult to have regular practices. But coach cum player and former Sri Lanka Youth M. Faiz and the team manager Feroze Inham are confident that the team would perform well and clinch the title for the fifth time.
The team is fully sponsored by the founder and president of Colombo Football FC, Ramanathan Puwanenthiran who is also a team member who will bear the entire expenses of the team including airfare and accommodation in India.
Puwanenthiran fondly known as Puhal is a great promoter of football and founded this club to ensure that retired soccerites enjoy their lives and be left in isolation.

Education reforms with modern facelift - Minister
The government will continue to find solutions to issues in the education system while introducing futuristic and modern educational reforms,Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
Minister Kariyawasam speaking at a ceremony held at St. Joseph's College Colombo, said the government has contributed immensely to the education system within the last two and half years.
When I took the position as Education Minister of Sri Lanka, of the 10,053 national schools, only a 65% had electricity. Now it is 95%. We have launched 18,500 projects in line with the Nearest School is the Best School national programme. We have given 26,000 sanitary toilet facilities within the last two and a half years as well. When we introduced the Suraksha Insurance scheme, we gave it not only to students in national schools, but to all school students including private schools and international schools, Kariyawasam said.
The Minister said plans are on to provide 150,000 laptop computers to all government schools by the end of this year.These laptop computers are taken on rent, considering the low cost and maintenance purposes,he said. He also said that every student starting classes for the Advanced Level Examination, will be provided with a branded iPad.The government is to provide iPads for teachers as well.
While pointing out that some small schools face the risk of closure, Kariyawasam said the government has taken action to reduce the minimum number of students per classroom to be 35 in the coming five years. Accordingly, the minimum number of students per classroom will be reduced each year from one head. Thus, in five years, the minimum number of student will be 35, Kariyawasam explained.
Highlighting the launch of smart class concept in 150 schools, Minister Kariyawasam said the government is considering recruiting around ten to fifteen thousand teachers in the next coming few months as well. He also said that the number of trainee teachers recruited to Teacher Training Colleges will be increased by 1500. Minister Kariyawasam added that the government expects to increase the number of trainees in Teacher Training Colleges to 10,000. He also said that teachers should have either a degree or three years education on the subject they will be teaching at schools.
Minister Kariyawasam pointed out that the present governments objective is to create a practical and competitive younger generation with good education, good hearts and good spiritual values.

Ensure independence of all education institutes -Archbishop
Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday urged the government to remove long continued political interference over the academia and ensure the independence of all education institutes in the country.
Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith also pointed out that making education institutes independent will immensely contribute to the development of a country as well.
The Archbishop of Colombo Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith further pointed out that a government exists to take policy decisions and present those policies to school administrations and not to influence or interfere.
There was a time when a politician made a teacher bow before a student. If a regional- level politician, for example, interferes with everything that takes place in a school, that school loses its independence. Such political interference undermine the value of teaching as a profession as well. At the end, such institutes will not create a just and disciplined society, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith pointed out.
This is the reason why the educational authorities must ensure the independence of all education institutions including schools. We request the government not to allow politicians to interfere in school administration, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith pointed out.
Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith was speaking yesterday at a ceremony held at St. Josephs College, Colombo to celebrate the Catholic Teachers' Day and the 25th anniversary of the Catholic Teachers Association.
He also requested the government to prevent the conducting of tuition classes on Poya days and Sunday mornings.
Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith pointed out that This request comes from all religious leaders in the country.
The children should be given time to participate in Dhamma schools and Sunday schools, or else there will be no enhancement in their spiritual traits, Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said. His Eminence also pointed out that schoolchildren are deprived of a carefree childhood due to the competitive education system and numerous private tuition classes.
I have seen schoolchildren in uniforms waiting to go home even at night. They are not given time to play like we did in our days, Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith said.
Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith also commended the Nearest School is the Best School national programme, pointing out that parents face many hardships in trying to provide for their childrens education.
Add to this challenge, there is a school van mafia as well. Apart from paying money for their childrens education, parents now have to pay for the school transport as well. When we were children, we walked to school, he pointed out.
Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith requested the Education Minster to continue with the excellent processes carried out by the government to improve the education system in Sri Lanka.

Evra red-carded before game for karate kick on own fan
Guimaraes: Marseille defender Patrice Evra was sent off after launching a karate-style kick at one of his team's own supporters before Thursday's Europa League match against Vitoria Guimaraes.
Evra, 36, was engaged in a heated exchange with a group of fans from an area reserved for around 500 Marseille supporters in Portugal before aiming a head-high kick with his left foot at one of them.
Some Marseille fans had managed to get out of their section of the stands and force their way to the touchline barriers where they harangued Evra at close contact as the French international warmed up before kick-off.
Stewards at the ground quickly intervened to break up the trouble, with Evra, who was originally listed as a substitute, ordered to return to the dressing room by the referee.
"Pat has experience, and he must not react, it's obvious," said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia whose side lost the game 1-0 and also had Boubacar Kamara sent off three minutes from time.
"Patrice is a more than just an experienced player. You can't respond, of course, to insults as bad as they are and as incredible as they might be because they come from one of our supporters."
"He must learn to keep his cool. That's all I can say."
Garcia, however, blasted the fan who taunted the 81-times capped Evra at the compact Portuguese stadium.
"He's not a supporter of Marseille, because you can't insult your own players, you have to be behind all of us."
The incident immediately brought back memories of another act of kung-fu kick madness by a French footballer.
In January 1995, Eric Cantona, playing for Manchester United, launched a flying kick at a Crystal Palace supporter at Selhurst Park who had jeered him after he had been sent off.
Cantona's assault led to a nine-month ban handed down by the English Football Association.
According to football statisticians Opta on Thursday: "Patrice Evra is the first player to be sent off before the start of a match in the history of the Europa League".
Europe's second-tier tournament replaced the UEFA Cup for the 2009-2010 season.
Evra, also a former Manchester United star, has received heavy criticism for his performances this season and lost his place in the team to on-loan Aston Villa left-back Jordan Amavi.

Gamini Senarath, two others file FR to prevent imminent arrest
Former Presidents Chief of Staff Gamini Sedara Senarath and two others have filed three Fundamental Rights petitions in the Supreme Court. They are seeking an order preventing the FCID from arresting them over a magisterial inquiries under the Public Property Act.
They have been named as suspects in a case for allegedly misusing Rs.4 billion in government funds by the Colombo Fort Magistrate.
Following a FCID request, the Fort Magistrate had also issued an order preventing them from leaving the country.
In their petitions, Gamini Sedara Senarath, former Managing Director of the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Piyadasa Kudabalage and former Commissioner of Samurdhi Neil Bandara Hapuwinna had cited Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara, the FCID Director, the Attorney General and several others as respondents. The petitioners maintained that the imminent arrest of themselves by the FCID at this juncture for politically motivated and malafide intentions of punishing the petitioner by depriving them of their personnel liberty for no legally justifiable reason and therefore constitutes an imminent infringement of the Fundamental Rights guaranteed to the petitioner by Article 14(1)(h) and 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution.
According to a B report filed before the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court, they have been accused of misusing government funds by illegally investing Rs.4 billion from the Rs.18.5 billion approved by the Cabinet in 2012. The concerned funds had been the allocation for the Kollupitiya Grand Hyatt Regency Hotel to be constructed by a company affiliated to the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, but invested in the Hambantota Hyatt Regency Hotel project.

Heroin arrests up over last year
Citing that police arrests related to heroin trafficking have gone up by over 60 percent over the last year, National Dangerous Drugs Control Board Chairman Ravindra Fernando said police were doing a good job battling the heroin trade.
Increased arrests and prosecutions are the best way to fight heroin getting into the country, he said.
But Fernando said without a detailed study, it was hard to know if the arrests reflect an increase in heroin trafficking and use, or increased effectiveness in law enforcement.The NDDCBs most recent data is from 2015. From January to June of that year, just over 20 percent of those arrested on drug charges were also users.
The bulk of the arrests were made in the Colombo district, NDDCB statistics show.
Fernando said most of the heroin coming into Sri Lanka is smuggled from India or Pakistan.
Alongside law enforcement, the board is also conducting educational campaigns in schools, and in the community, Fernando said. We are doing it almost weekly in schools throughout the island.

Influenza B spreading fast in SL
Influenza B virus is spreading fast in Sri Lanka currently, a Consultant Virologist attached to the National Influenza Centre of the Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute (MRI) Dr. Chrishan Jude Jayamaha, told the Daily News yesterday.
According to Dr. Jayamaha, a seasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of high fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and runny nose.
Cough could be severe and can last up to two or more weeks. Most people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention.
The incubation period is about two days, he said. Seasonal influenza spreads easily and can sweep through schools, nursing homes, businesses or towns.
When an infected person coughs, infected droplets get into the air and another person can breathe them in and be exposed.
The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses, he said. To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing, and wash their hands regularly, he added.

Kandy SC favourites against CH in curtain-raiser today
Gigantic Kandy Sports Club will battle it out with the new look CH and FC in their opening match of the 2017/18 season in the Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby tournament match at Race Course grounds today with the kick-off scheduled for 4.00pm.
Kandy SC will once again start the season as hot favourites to win the league championship but will have stiff opposition coming their way from teams like CR & FC, CH and FC and the three armed forces Navy SC, Army SC and Air Force SC as these teams are very well equipped to spoil Kandys party.
Certainly Kandy SC will not have a cake walk to retain the league that easy this time around.
For todays game Kandy will put out their best team with several key Sri Lanka national players including playmaker Fazil Marija down to play. Hence they will have the upper hand against the CH.
Meanwhile the Maitland Crescent club will start with skipper Rohitha Rajapaksa up front at fly half pairing off with either experienced Piyum Jayasinghe or Wesleys nippy scrum half Avishka Lee.
Also ex-Navy and Sri Lanka national player Lee Keegal will play in the pivotal position of centre, most probably along with Avantha Lee who is the twin brother of Avishka.
St.Anthonys College Kandy star player Samuel Maduwantha will play in the starting line-up as full back, manning the important last line of defence for CH. Going by the two team cards Kandy is having a slight advantage over the young CH side who go into this game as the underdogs. On their day CH and FC will play a different brand of rugby to topple any side by creating a shock victory since the match will take place at Race Course which has now become their home ground. Last season Kandy won both league games.
Havies have edge over Police
The battle between two top rugby sides Havelocks SC and Police SC in their Dialog A division inter-club league rugby first round opening match for the 2017/18 season at Havelock Park today should turn out to be a close game. The match will kick off at 6.30 pm.
Havies should have the edge over the somewhat depleted Police outfit which has lost several of their key players to other clubs this season.
Havelocks have been training really hard under their new captain and Sri Lanka national player Jason Melder and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win. Police SC on the other hand trained really hard this week under the watchful eyes of their new head coach veteran Shamly Nawaz who is also a former CR & FC, Sri Lanka national under 20 coach and the present head coach of Zahira College rugby team.
The cops will have to be at their level best if they are to beat the Havies outfit in their own den at Havelock Park. But looking at the two teams, Havelocks will definitely go out as the favourites to clinch this contest.

Lewis Hamilton  claims his place among the greats
MEXICO CITY: Lewis Hamilton joined one of sport's most exclusive clubs on Sunday when he became Britain's most successful racing driver of all time by claiming his fourth Formula One world title.
His ninth-place finish at the Mexican Grand Prix lifted him into the company of the sport's true greats as he joined his nearest contemporary rival Sebastian Vettel and Alain Prost as a four-time champion.
Only two drivers have achieved more - seven-time champion Michael Schumacher and five-time champion Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio - while Hamilton leaves behind a cluster of five celebrated masters of the track on three apiece.
To have won more than men like Australia's Jack Brabham, fellow-Briton Jackie Stewart, Austrian Niki Lauda and Brazilians Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna is a spectacular statement of achievement.
The son of a black father and a white mother, who survived a broken home in his youth, Hamilton, 32, grew up on a municipal housing estate in Stevenage where his father Anthony at one time held down three jobs to fund his son's embryonic racing career in karts.
His journey was unprivileged and without luxury, but it was clear from an early age that he had an outstanding gift for speed and all the gutsy natural instincts of a born racer.
In 1995, aged 10, and wearing a jacket and shoes borrowed from his predecessor as British Formula Cadet karting champion, he went to a glittering awards ceremony in London where he met McLaren's then-boss Ron Dennis.
He asked for an autograph and told him "one day I want to race for you". Dennis replied: "Phone me in nine years and I'll sort you a deal."
The McLaren chief did not wait that long. After less than three years, he agreed to support Hamilton's passage through the junior formulae en route to his F1 debut with his team in 2007.
'MERCURIAL, TEMPESTUOUS'
Bold, determined and individual, he almost won the title in his first record-breaking season as he reeled off nine successive podiums from his debut in Melbourne, rocking the establishment along the way with his speed and his style.
On and off the track, he was fast, somewhat mercurial and occasionally tempestuous and this combination led to a fierce rivalry with team-mate and two-time champion Fernando Alonso, who left McLaren at the end of the year.
That was a signal of how tough it was to be for all his future team-mates as Hamilton, who narrowly missed out on the 2007 title, returned to triumph in 2008 with a dramatic last-gasp fifth-place finish in Brazil.
He also showed frustration as McLaren failed to deliver the speed to beat Vettel and Red Bull, who reeled off four straight title triumphs from 2010 to 2013, by when Hamilton had departed for Mercedes.
Escaping the management regime of Dennis and his father, Hamilton found freedom at Mercedes alongside team-mate German Nico Rosberg, his teenage karting friend and rival.
This enabled Hamilton to express himself with a headline-grabbing trans-Atlantic lifestyle, mixing with musicians and 'fashionistas'.
He showed little love for any duty to obey conventions and, for many observers, gave his sport a welcome injection of freshness and diversity as champion again in 2014 and 2015.
Rosberg broke Hamilton's sequence of supremacy in 2016 and then retired, leaving the Englishman to return this year and, helped by Ferrari's October failings, deliver another season of record-breaking success.
He arrived in Mexico with a record 72 pole positions to his name and 62 wins, 29 fewer than Schumacher on 91, but established as arguably the fastest of all time over a single lap.
His former McLaren team-mate Jenson Button summed up Hamilton's pure speed when he said: "For me, over one lap, I don't think there is anyone as quick as Lewis and I don't think there ever has been."
'NEVER SATISFIED'
That speed, which has always been a natural talent, has this season been allied to a more mature attitude to his job as team leader in the post-Rosberg era at Mercedes.
Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff summed up: "He is never satisfied. He never settles. He is never happy with where he is as a racing driver and a human being. He wants to optimise, to develop and he is very much part of the leadership of the team."
Having achieved so much as his sport's outstanding man of the moment and best-known ambassador, it is now likely that Hamilton's humanity - and his sensitivity to social issues - will emerge more frequently.
His own career and his quest for self-expression and freedom has shaped his advice for young drivers.
"What I can definitely advise any kid that's out there trying to race is don't listen to people who tell you that you need a mental coach or you need someone to help control your mind," he said.
"You need to let it run wild and free and discover yourself. It is all about discovery. And only you can do it."

Local Polls at last
With the signing by Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils Faizer Mustapha of the Gazette notification pertaining to the new Mixed Electoral System earlier this week, the Local Government (LG) Elections are now slated to be held in January next year.
The LG Polls were delayed for a couple of years until the completion of the delimitation process and the refinement of a new electoral system. While many politicians, including those from the Government itself, blamed Minister Mustapha for intentionally delaying the polls, his explanation was that he had to do a perfect job vis--vis the entirely no-political and non-partisan delimitation process. According to the Minister, all the impediments to holding the LG election have now been resolved.
According to new amendments the number of Local Government bodies has increased up to 341. According to the gazette notification four new Pradeshiya Sabhas have been created in the Nuwara Eliya District. The area which comes under the purview of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha have been sub-divided into three areas namely Ambagamuwa, Norwood, and Maskeliya Pradeshiya Sabhas while the Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabha division have been sub-divided into three areas namely Nuwara Eliya, Agarapathana, and Kotawila Pradeshiya Sabhas. The number of councillors has also increased to 8,356.
Accordingly, the Elections Commission would issue the nomination note in the week starting after November 27, 2017. The parties and independent groups intending to contest will have to tender nomination papers starting from December 11 and ending at 12:00 p.m. on December 17. The nominations will be accepted during a three and a half day period between December 11 and 20. The Commission according to the Local Government Elections Act will select a date between January 25 and 31 other than a Sunday or a Government holiday to hold the polls. Judging by past elections, the election could well be held on a Saturday, which is convenient for all.
There are many positive aspects of the new electoral system which will do away with the Proportional Representation (PR) system in its present form. The PR system favoured candidates awash with finds because only they could campaign throughout an entire district. However, with the proposed new system, a mix of First-Past-the-Post and PR (under which all future elections are likely to be held), candidates will mostly be elected from their own wards or electorates. This will enable middle-class professional candidates with no current political background to emerge on to the political limelight. In fact, the Government deserves plaudits for insisting on a quota for women and youth representation at local bodies despite opposition from certain backward groups. Nomination papers of political parties or independent groups which do not adhere to this stipulation are likely to be rejected by elections officials.
This is a step in the right direction as womens representation in politics is still at a very low level in Sri Lanka cross all political bodies and institutions despite the country producing the worlds first woman Prime Minister way back in 1960. Youth from both sexes will get an opportunity to shine on the political stage and make an active contribution to development through the new Local Bodies. After all, they are more in sync with the grassroots and have a better knowledge of a given areas development needs.
Delimitation was also a necessary exercise, given that demography and development imperatives have changed over the last few decades in many areas. Some of the municipal wards have been drawn up decades ago and have little or no relevance in todays context of population growth and fast-paced development. This concern has been reflected in the break-up of Ambaganuwa and Nuwara Eliya Pradeshiya Sabhas into more manageable units. However, some have expressed reservations about the increase in the number of councillors which is almost double the present number from a cost: benefit perspective. Indeed, no purpose will be served by increasing the number of local councillors per se if they do not deliver the goods. A mechanism must be in place to ensure that the people derive the maximum benefit from the proposed expansion of local bodies.
At a time when there are a lot of misconceptions floating around on devolution, Local Bodies are prime examples for devolution in action. If the Central Government alone and by itself can do everything in all areas, then there would no need for the existence of local bodies and Grama Sevakas. Decentralization to the village level was needed because only the political and community leaders in the villages possess an intimate knowledge about the shortcomings and needs of their areas. It is also a locally tried and tested method that has generally been effective.
The Local Polls and the subsequent Provincial Council polls will also be a golden opportunity for the electorate to make a fresh start, without endorsing corrupt, inept or racist elements. Voters islandwide will get a chance to vote for professionally qualified, untainted men and women who will be committed to uplift their areas. They should not squander this chance to start a new political culture in 2018.

Major breach of security as man drives car onto cricket playing field
NEW DELHI, Friday - A major security breach at the Air Force Sports Complex in Palam allowed a man, who identified himself as Girish Sharma, drive his car onto the field of play and into the pitch during the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh Ranji game at Palam A ground in New Delhi on Friday.
The man claimed he didnt see any security and was merely lost, despite what looked like deliberate swerves to drive over the pitch twice, completely ignoring attempts from players and umpires to stop him. A number of international players like Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina, Ishant Sharma and Rishabh Pant are in action.
The incident took place at 4.40pm, 20 minutes from close of play after the match officials took the half hour extension to make up for the over-rate. The match referee deemed the pitch playable after examining potential damage. The match will begin as scheduled on the final day at 9.15am.
Uttar Pradesh, who pocketed the first innings lead, were 224 for 7, ahead by 246, when play stopped. The lost time could thwart both teams in their quest for an outright result.
Delhi, who have one win in two matches so far, were denied an outright win in their tournament opener in controversial circumstances. Assam were accused of slowing down the game and bowling just seven out of the mandatory 15 overs in the last hour of play, leaving Delhi inches short of an outright win.
With no other venue available, the fixture, which is Delhis home game, was shifted to the Palam ground because the Feroz Shah Kotla was engaged for the first India-New Zealand Twenty20 International on Wednesday. AFP

MERCANTILE TABLE TENNIS ASSOCIATION DIAMOND JUBILEE 2017
The odyssey of the Mercantile Table Tennis Association commenced in 1957 with the inaugural meeting held in the Board room of Richard Peiris & Co. Ltd, chaired by Robin L Rutnam. The meeting attended by the following unfurled an epoch making event in the annals of Table Tennis in the country.
N.M. Udeshi (Siedles Cineradio), M.Balaji (Acme Trading Co.), C. Paramananthan (Turquand Young), R. K. Singham (A.I Macan Markar), T. Falaldeen (Bank of Ceylon), Eric Motha (ICI), LFW Ponniah, Basil Dabare andA. Rasiah (Shell), N. M. Lakdawala (Ford Rhodes Thornton), KC Chandraraj (Turquand Young), R. Buultjens, Paul Thambinayagam (Mercantile Bank), Trevor Dabrera (E. John Thompson White). Basil Dabare and LFW Ponniah were elected Secretary and Treasurer respectively of the MTTA the controlling body in the Mercantile and Banking sectors.
As a founder member I find it a privilege to herald the Diamond Jubilee of the MTTA efficiently steered by dedicated persons who carried on the legacy upholding the mantle of the MTTA over six decades.
The Association has been the recipient of the goodwill and generosity extended by the following Patrons/Vice Patrons: NM Udeshi, AK Nesaratnam, TCA De Soysa, S.Viswanathan, Dr. IA Ismail, Inayet Akberally, Ana Punchihewa, S. Nagendra, LCD (Cubby) Wijetunge, Chandrakant Vasa, Aloy Ratnayake, HDS Amarasuriya, Sarath Gunaratne, Rajiva Wijetunge and M Ruzaik Jabir.
The MTTA has since its inception conducted the following tournaments with noteworthy increase in participating firms:
 Mercantile League & Knock-Out Championships
 Mercantile & Open Championships
 Veterans (over 40)
Invitation tournaments have also been conducted in tribute to the following whose contribution to the game in the Mercantile Sector deserves special mention:
CM Vasa, Chrys Gunaratne and Ashok Melvani.
M. Balaji, who played a pivotal role in the formation of the Table Tennis Association of Ceylon in the 1940succeeded Robin L Rutnam and assisted by Vice Presidents C. Paramananthan and AK Nesaratnam, RK Singham (Secretary) and Trevor Dabrera (Treasurer) and Council members continued to consolidate the groundwork in place.
In 1969, the MTTA during the tenure of former National champion, Norshir Lakdawala as President, created history in organizing the inaugural Dinner Dance aptly titled Bouncing Ball, possibly a first among sports controlling bodies in Ceylon.
The Dance was a trail blazer and afforded an opportunity for players to meet one another in a spirit of camaraderie following the conclusion of the tournaments. NE Thangarajah, a member of the Council and sports journalist at Lake House made this reference in an article penned for the Souvenir:
From small beginnings this infant of Mercantile Sports has grown up to be a big child, big enough to be called one of the proud sons of the Mercantile sector.
During the presidency of Norshir Lakdawala, Wijesiri Daluwatte was elected Secretary with GEP Jayatileke (Treasurer) and Eric Motha (Asst. Secretary).
On Lakdawala leaving for USA to accept an appointment with the World Bank M. Balaji was elected President for a second term and with his successor Charlie Daniel continued the good work of their predecessors.
Chandrakant M. Vasa was unanimously elected as President in 1974 and the years that followed propelled the MTTA to great heights in the domain of Mercantile sports. W. Daluwatte, the energetic Secretary passed away in 1976 and Asst. Secretary Eric Motha succeeded him with GEP Jayetileke filling in the post of Treasurer.
The Vasa-Motha-Jayetileke era was possibly the longest in the annals of the Association. Vasa exuded a charisma all his own and the MTTA made vast strides with a remarkable increase in membership and the popularity of TT was at its zenith.
The highest tribute to the MTTA was witnessed in 1983 when the Minister of Sports appointed Chandrakant Vasa as President of the newly constituted Board of Control for TT and Eric Motha and Lucian Alles as Secretary and Treasurer respectively.
At this point of time the MTTA literally strode the Table Tennis stage like a colossus with the same office bearers at the helm of both the Mercantile and National controlling organizations. Leonard Perera succeeded Alles in 1988.
Bouncing Ball made a welcome return after a brief hiatus and successfully organized under the chairmanship of Vice President Rodney St. John.
In 1990 Vasa deemed it was time to vacate office after a laudable stint of nearly two decades as President. Eric Motha, Senior Vice President was elected as President for a brief period until his emigration in 1991. GEP Jayetileke, another stalwart assumed office and rendered yeoman service (92 to 98) with the MTTA celebrating its Golden Jubilee during his tenure.
The mantle was handed over to M R Jabir who guided the Associations activities over the next 4 years with dedication and exemplary zeal.
He was succeeded by Sarath Gunaratne who led the MTTA from 2003-2006 and also 2009-10.
Ajith Gamage a former Secretary filled in between 2007 & 2008. Dananjaya Darmaratne was elected President in 2011 followed by Rajiva Wijetunge, (2012 to 2014) prior to handing over to Madusanka Gammanpila who is privileged to be at the helm in this Jubilee year.
The MTTA was served by a line of efficient Hony. Secretaries since the inception:
Basil Dabare, RK Singham, W.Daluwatte, Eric Motha, T. Pararajasingham, AK Issadeen, J.Miranda, ABR Soris, B. DOlivera, LAA Fernando, Sunil Meewewa, P.Udayaratne, Darlon Perera, J.Antonaianus, P. Sooriyarachchi, SR Gunawardene, T Ram Kumar, D. Sellaperuma, Sandun Kanchana, Sulkita Rukshan, Madusanka Gammanpila, Ashan Wickramanayake and Kasum Punchihewa the present Secretary.
The list of Treasurers comprised Lionel Ponniah, Trevor Dabrera, FJS Le Grand, GEP Jayetileke, Lucian Alles, Leonard Perera, M Ruzaik Jabir, Reza Latiff, J. Antonaianus, P. Sooriyarachchi, Athula Ratnaweera, Hemantha Karunatileke, Upali Ranjith, Janaka Mendis, Hashan Fonseka & present holder Gamunu Prabath (2011-2017)
It is also pertinent to record the contribution made by the following towards the success of the MTTA, prior to the 90s:
T. Falaldeen, G. Jeevathram, Annesley Gomez, Rasakantha Rasiah, George Van Hoff, ACM Rauff, Robert Joseph, Sunimal Salgadoe, MB De Silva, DSS Jayantha, DM Munasinghe, S. Botejue.
Rajiva Wijetunge, M Ruzaik Jabir, Sarath Gunaratne, Ajith Gamage, Dananjaya Darmaratne and Madusanka Gammanpila, have carved a niche in the annals of the MTTA with their invaluable services towards the progress of the Association since the 1990s.
Rajiva Wijetunges record at Table Tennis to date at Mercantile, National and International levels is phenomenal having commenced in 1979 as a member of the fancied Ceylon Tobacco Company team who won the Mercantile League & Knock-out tournaments in 1987 and leading the Ceylinco team to Championship honours from 2004 to 2006. He won the Veterans Singles in 2006, 07, 12 and 2013.
In recent years(2012 to 2016) Rajiva anchored MAS to victory in the League & Knock-out tournaments. Rajiva embellished his success saga winning the Bronze Medal in Mens Singles (over 45) at the World Masters Games held in Edmonton, Canada in 2015.
In addition to his sporting prowess Rajiva was elected President of the Table Tennis Association of Sri Lanka (2007 to 2009) and 2015/16. Rajiva has blazed a trail both as a formidable player and administrator par excellence.
Chandrakant Vasa, Sarath Gunaratne, Rajiva Wijetunge, Lalith Priyantha were elected Presidents and Eric Motha and Ajith Gamage as Secretaries of the Table Tennis Association.
The Mercantile TT Association has during the past six decades produced a galaxy of National Champions & Ranked players:
NM Udeshi, M. Balaji, Charlie Daniel, Chrys Gunaratne, Norshir Lakdawala. Pesi Pestonjee, K. Arichandran, RK Singham, Paul Thambinayagam, KC Chandraraj, A.Theivendran, Annesley Gomez, Angelo Santiago, Suresh Melvani,Deepak Naraindas, Ashok Melvani, Mungo Melvani, Sarath Gunaratne, Lalith Priyantha, KST Chalitha Rangana,Christopher Arnolda, Umesh De Alwis, Indika Prasad,Rohan Sirisena,Thilina Piyadasa, Buddika Walagampola,Nirmala Jayasinghe,George Van Hoff, Ramesh Dharamdas, Shabbar & Shabbir Hussain, Rasakantha Rasiah, MB De Silva, Sunimal Salgadoe, WA Buddhasiri. I Jayasiri, Nihal Gunaratne, Lucky Fernandez, Cecil Perera, PD Ratnasiri, Lal Hirdaramani, LB Speering, G.S. Rajah, Lalith Perera, A. S. Ageez, Ranjith Perera, Lucian Alles, Ajith Gamage, Shehan Salgadoe, A. Ragunathan, Rajiva Wijetunge, Gamini Moraes, Athula Ratnaweera, Wasantha Perera, T. Ram Kumar, Ajith Kumara, Deeptha Sellaperuma,Chameera Ginige, JAJA Perera, MPSS Perera and WRR Fonseka.
In the Ladies sector we had evergreen Belle Weerakoon, Cuckoo Fonseka, Nandini Daniel, Carol Rudolph, Srini Lucas, Namal Gunasekera, Tamara Hewage, Swarna Peiris, Deepika Rodrigo, Kalpani Herath, Saranga De Silva, Upeka Kotinkaduwa, Sachie Tennekoon and Srimali Wimalaratne. (My apologies for any inadvertent omissions).
I am confident the saga will continue and the dominant position the MTTA holds in the realm of sports in the country will remain firm as we pay tribute to the officials and players who contributed to the tapestry woven through sixty long years.
AD MULTOS ANNOS!

## Title: Opposition weakens in Constitution Debate

Opposition weakens in Constitution Debate
The warnings of bomb attacks on parliament and efforts to raise religious hatred and major divisions in the country through the constitution debate have so far met with no success, as the opponents show little substance in the debate on the Interim Report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
The debate continues with increased days as the search for understanding on the need for a new constitution and the key factors in the constitutional changes envisaged in it remains, with those opposed to any constitutional change unable to make much headway with facts that must be the substance of the debate.
The structure of the State of Sri Lanka - whether unitary or republican, the position of Buddhism, the Executive Presidency and the National Question remain the key issues in the debate, with diversions of political manipulation such as the challenge to the validity of the Constitutional Assembly, the story of a US drafted constitution being with the government, and the fears for national unity as seen from the Catalan issue in Spain, certainly adding to the diversity bunkum and frill in the debate.
The build up by the opposition, especially by the Joint Opposition (JO) supported by racial and religious extremist forces, seeking to show that what was before the Parliament, converted to the Constitutional Assembly, was the final draft of the next constitution, certainly lost much of its impact as the debate moved on, and the Prime Minister made it clear the preparation of a new constitution needed a much broader and longer discussion, reaching the next Sinhala-Tamil New Year, in April 2018.
With the governments declared commitment to have a religious state, as opposed to a secular state, giving Buddhism the foremost place, the Prime Minister has emphasized the government would meet the Mahanayake Theras and other religious leaders, as well as political parties, to continue the search for national consensus on the issue of a new constitution. He was conveying the message that preparation of a constitution is a major task of the people, with the participation of all sections of society in the democratic process, and could not be the task of those embracing extremist positions.
There was an interesting agreement by the government on many of the key issues raised by the JO, with the agreement to preserve the ekeeya bhavaya or unitary status of the Republic, giving Buddhism the foremost place, Provincial Councils not being allowed to create divisions in the country, and the Leader of the Opposition to be elected by Parliament. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was clear the government did obtain a mandate to compile a new constitution, which was also part of the policies of the key parties in the ruling coalition, the UNP and SLFP, and was thus working according to its mandate.
Local Polls
The signing of the Gazette to hold the Local Government polls could lead to a new debate over the control and running of local government bodies in the country. However, with the politics of power being more the stuff of all debate today, the constitution will remain in the campaign for the local government polls. The JO with its new political arm of the Lotus Bud - Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP), will take its overall false anti-constitutional change message, with its other criticisms of the government in the approaching campaign for elections due in the last week of January 2018.
The Local Polls will certainly be a major challenge to the government with a clear threat to its unity, as the SLFP and the UNP will be contesting each other, with the SLPP looking forward to making capital from this confrontation. The efforts to bring some unity within the SLFP have so far showed no success. The JO sections are calling for the SLFP leadership to be given to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to bring about any such unity; which will not be accepted by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The SLPP looking forward to pushing the Sirisena-led SLFP to third place in the Local Government Polls will also face another major political challenge. The divisions in the SLFP  between the SLFP and SLPP  will give strength to the UNP that remains undivided, a political party, a mass following that looks forward to bigger and better days ahead. The divisions within the SLFP, and the emergence of the SLPP with Rajapaksa leadership, will certainly place the UNP on a new position of strength, posing a major political opposition to the SLPP, preventing it from showing what it believes to be the renewed strength of Mahinda Rajapaksa in electoral politics.
Dual citizenship
The Supreme Court has given the final verdict rejecting petition of Geetha Kumarasinghe, against the Appeal Court judgment that ruled her election as a Member of Parliament invalid due to being a Dual Citizen.
This decision comes when the Australian Government is faced with a major crisis with the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce having to resign with the High Court finding his election invalid due to having New Zealand citizenship too. Shortly after the resignation of Mr. Joyce, the President of the Australian Senate, Stephen Parry, also resigned when it was revealed he could be a UK citizen by descent through his father. In a country that is largely an immigrant nation, this position is certainly troubling, as many politicians are unaware of their citizenship links, because of unknown foreign citizenship that had come through their parents  these include New Zealand, Italian, Greek, Canadian and Cypriot citizenships.
The Court order on Geetha Kumarasinghe is drawing the interest of political parties in Sri Lanka to make a deeper study of the Dual Citizenship disqualification for those seeking elections to public office. As they see it, the restriction introduced with the 19th Amendment, has prevented those holding Dual Citizenship from contesting parliamentary elections. There is thinking that this should be extended to other elections, especially to the Provincial Councils and the Executive Presidency. There is the thinking that if a Dual Citizen is unsuitable to be elected to Parliament, such a person should also be unsuitable for elections to Provincial Councils and the Executive Presidency, two positions that can be influenced by ones other citizenship in the conduct of ones duty, which can be anti-national.
They believe the government should consider further amendments to the Constitution and Elections Laws to ensure that this restriction is extended, and suggest a careful study of the Australian Constitution in this regard. The relevant Section 44 states:
Any person who - (i.) Is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or citizen of a foreign power:
(iv.) Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth - shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives.
The Australian Election Commission reproduces the sections in its Candidates Handbook, where it draws particular attention to S 44 (i) and (iv). As to the nomination form, it advises that to give false or misleading information, or to omit any information if omitting that information would be misleading, is a criminal offence and that the maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 12 months.
They propose that the Elections Commission would also look into this aspect of necessary change to the Electoral Laws, and restrictions on nominations.
SAITM positive
The announcement by the Committee of Vice Chancellors of State Universities that it sees the latest government proposal on SAITM can be accepted as positive and constructive could be a major move to resolving this issue that has dragged on for far too long.
They state that since a positive situation has been created for all medical students of state universities to continue their education and clinical training, the students engage in their academic work with immediate effect.
The Vice Chancellors have made their statement having thoroughly considered the harmful impact made on the Health Sector due to the absence of students from their academic work in all State Medical Faculties during the past number of months, as well as the uncertainties created on the future of medical students.
The Vice Chancellors statement comes after the GMOA too made welcome announcement of the new proposal for a non-profit making SAITM institution to proceed with medical education. However, the medical students of the eight medical faculties continue their boycott of lectures and clinical training, calling for the nationalization of SAITM. The Government will soon have to take the necessary steps to drive any possible sense to the minds of these student union leaders, asking them to give ear to what the Vice Chancellors say.

Our aim is to prevent the Micro Finance Mafia - S.B.
Our aim is to relieve poor people from the Micro Finance Mafia by developing the "Samurdhi Banks System" which has been malfunctioning during the past 10 years. Minister of Social Empowerment, Welfare and Kandyan Heritage, S.B. Dissanayake said at the official meeting to award registered certificates to the Samurdhi divisional organizations on November 02 at Suhurupaya, Battaramulla.
He said the micro finance mafia has been devouring rural areas and poor people of this country for nearly a decade. "This is not just a mafia but a cancer which destroys the economic foundation and strength of the poor people in rural areas. The Samurdhi programme had not been developed to address such issues during the past few years. It is our duty to serve the majority poor people of this country via Samurdhi Banks," he said.
The minister further added that after 22 years of establishing the Samurdhi programme, we have now succeeded in registering divisional organizations giving them the authority to work freely within a legal background. "As the founding minister of Samurdhi, Im very happy to notice that the Samurdhi programme has earned around Rs. 2,000 billion as its capital which is not the money from the government Treasury or foreign money, but the money collected from the poor people across the country. Since we have such a large reserve, we have the strength to serve people better, through the Samurdhi Bank network with proper planning. If the people need to buy a vehicle, they now don't need to go to leasing companies with hidden interests. If they need to get fast cash by pawning their gold, we can make arrangements by strengthening the facilities. If the people need to get a loan within a day, we should tailor the system according to the needs since we have enough money."
When there is a funeral, the normal procedure is to grant financial aid only after obtaining the death certificate.
But it must be changed, because the money should be provided at the time of need, he said, adding that if not it is of no use. "Even at confinement, money should be given to the mother when she is admitted to hospital or at least within five days after hospitalization.
This is not difficult. Only the system needs to be changed. We have already taken the necessary steps to strengthen the Samurdhi bank system. On November 15, we will award appointment letters to 1,904 Samurdhi Development Officers.
After the appointments, we will also give them a 'Leadership Training Programme in collaboration with the Army. It will help develop their physical, mental and social status," said Minister Dissanayake.
He said funds will be provided for poor people to build their homes by providing Rs. 200,000 every month. Further the Samurdhi housing fund has already funded many housing projects to assist the people to build houses.
Director General Samurdhi, Dr. Sunil Jayantha Nawarathne, Deputy Director P.R.D.H Anurawansa also participated.

Path to democracy and governance
Coming from Ananda Collage, the epicentre of Sinhala Buddhism, when I entered Engineering Faculty what impressed me most at that stage was the fact the so many Tamils and others, mixed freely with the Sinhalese, both within the lecture rooms and outside. In those days, in spite of some racist elements here and there, all students and staff of the entire university worked together without squinter or suspicion. I do not think that any Sinhala student felt uneasy learning under Mailvaganam, Mahalingam, Sivaprakasapillai and Thurairaja.
Not only non racism and non communalism but also spirit of honesty and fair play was given to all of us by their example. University teachers of all nationalities trained us to accept differences and eccentricities among humans that should be tolerated and at every opportunity these varieties to be made use for better result.
Every member of the intelligentsia should be tolerant and innovative; obstacle should be an opportunity for innovation not failure and jealousy. I believe such standards are kept still, by all universities in Lanka whether these exist in the North, East or South. Presently many university dons of all nationalities contribute to the democratic movement making many sacrifices.
Extreme powers
One learned Sinhala pandit has said that the ethnic and cultural identity of the Tamils living outside the North, and the identities of Sinhala and Muslims living in the North could be ensured not through the provincial council system, but by giving the necessary powers to the local government bodies. Similar view was expressed by the commissioner of LLRC, though he wanted provincial councils with more powers. Some believe that the country would end up in anarchy if the executive presidency was abolished without introducing a stable parliamentary system. Such opinions have come from speakers during the Constitutional Assembly sessions on the proposals to draft a new Constitution.
It is true yahapalana government had acted to curb the extreme powers of the executive presidency by enacting the 19th Amendment; made it more democratic. However it is incorrect to say Every sector in the country including the provincial council system would be thrown into chaos, if the executive presidency was abolished. What is best for our country is to make the post more democratic.
Those who want to retain executive presidency argue that the clauses with regard to the unitary state in the Constitution should remain intact in all three languages, Sinhala, Tamil and English. The unitary character of the State is vital for economic and political stability, and to protect environmental sustainability and ensure social harmony. The problems faced by the Tamil people would not be resolved by devolving more powers to the Northern Provincial Council. It could be done only by the political parties representing Tamil people in the North working in conjunction with the central government to ensure success for their people. These are mere majoritist arguments rejected by rational minds.
There is a disputed statement that claims the two Maha Nayaka of the Malwatta and the Asgiri Chapters issued a special announcement saying Sri Lanka did not need a new constitution or amendments to the present Constitution of the country. It further states that, the Anunayake of the Malwatta Chapter, Ven. Dimbulkumbure Wimaladharma Thera told the media that the proposed Constitution is detrimental as it will devolve such power to provinces so much, not even the parliament will have power to control the Provincial Councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas! Apparently Thera has emphasized that the Maha Nayaka of the other two Buddhist Chapters, Ramanya and Amarapura Nikaya, as well agree to this statement. Hence the entire Maha Sangha, will be enlightened on the reforms and their strong opposition to a new constitution will be expressed. However there were disagreement and contradictions. Most certainly many other Nayaka Theras disagree with these statements.
Buddhists in Lanka talk highly of their rich past of 2500 years and believe they have a great treasure to give to the whole world. This makes Lanka a country of boasts  very proud of a vast and rich culture spanning over 2500 years. Through this rich past, Buddhist Lankans are hell-bent on recreating identity as missionaries of future mankind; taking the message of meththa, karuna, muditha and upekka, sticking to it, practicing and ever moving forward, never aspiring to be more than what Ananda and Oldcot did in the past! But unfortunately they have nothing to do now, except spreading greed, hate and misunderstanding among other nationalities.
They talk about a past that is gone with nothing valuable to do in the present. Strangely, they yearn for a future of sacrifice and sacred commitments. They continuously assert the whole world will be Buddhist and that is the end of civilization. However, all what they do today is speak of the history of this country without truly attempting to add a treasure to this history. Sinhala Buddhist have gone stagnant and rooted, said one intellectual in a discussion recently.
Equality and unity
It is correct to say that considering the state some countries have achieved only in the last 400 to 500 years, Lanka is nowhere near that rate of development. Lanka could have developed with the rest of the world if, instead of wrongly analyzing the past and wasting time dreaming about the past, lived in the present.
There is simply no point taking pride in all historical artefacts and stupas if people do not also make use of them to develop as a nation uniting all communities in the country. One devout Buddhist said, I would like to mention that the Buddha never preached to mix his damma with political policy and governing. He did not attempt to advice the countrys leaders on how to lead. As time went on, Kings and Maha Rajas made way for monks to be a part of governance, and today, we have mistaken this, and allowed religion to govern the lands. We are told to give priority to Buddhism, but how are we to do that when there are multiple chapters in this country alone
The Buddha preached equality and unity. How then, were these Chapters formed What foundations are these Chapters based on It is indeed ironic that many of these Chapters are based on Caste basis, and the Buddha has always rejected the caste system. This issue is not just something we can avoid or ignore. It is a truly heartbreaking fact that we have held on to our 2500-year-old past so much that it has now become cause for that very same pride inducing past to destroy a potential future for the country. It has annihilated the entire system of this country.
We need to create a generation that is willing to think new and to think deep. The path that this current government is taking is appropriate.

PM FOR REVITALISED EDUCATION SYSTEM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said the present education system needs to be revitalised. He pointed out that the present school system has lost its momentum to a certain degree where as a large number of tuition classes and international schools have taken over the education system.
The Prime Minister warranted innovative thinking as a part of the revitalisation process of the education system.
Premier Wickremesinghe also pointed out that a few decades ago, there were very good schools centered in each main city.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was speaking at a ceremony held yesterday at St. Josephs College, Colombo to celebrate Catholic Teachers Day.
The Prime Minister also said that parents are going through many hardships to find a good school for their children and expressed surprise at the amount of money that parents have to pay for international schools.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said discussions are ongoing with regard to providing more support for semi-government schools.
The Prime Minister also said the present government is to promote the concept where such government funded schools will act as mentors for their closest and selected schools.
Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out that such a concept will generate a win-win situation for both parties.
While commending the excellent role played by semi-government schools in providing quality education, Premier Wickremesinghe said the move to nationalise all schools in 1961 had more negative results for the education system than good points.
I studied the debate with regards to this move and both Dudley Senanayake and J.R. Jayewardene had argued against this move. They requested to take over only the necessary schools under the control of the government and that the other schools be guided by the respective organisations, the Prime Miniuster said.
The Premier also pointed out that because of this move, many schools under both the Catholic Church and Buddhist organisations were handed over to the government. When the government nationalised all schools, the Catholic Church could only retain a few schools. All the Buddhist schools except Musaeus College were handed over to the government. More Catholic and Buddhist schools should have been allowed to remain alongside with the national schools, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. The Prime Minister pointed out that former President Ranasinghe Premadasa received his education at St. Josephs College. He said that President Premadasa was proud of the fact that the education he received at St. Josephs College school contributed much to his political career.
Premier Wickremesinghe also pointed out that in order to revive the education system, the need for qualified teachers is a must. National and private schools should have dynamic teachers with knowledge, skills, discipline and spiritual value. There is no holistic education system without dynamic teachers, he added. The Prime Minister deeply appreciated the contribution made by the Catholic teachers in empowering the future of the country with quality education. Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, His Grace Most Reverend Dr. Oswald Gomis (Archbishop Emeritus) and Secretary to the Ministry of Education Sunil Hettiarachchi also participated in the event.

Rumour sparks panic buying for petrol
Long queues were seen at filling stations in Colombo yesterday evening with reports of a fuel shortage spreading.
However,CEYPETCO denied these reports, stating that fuel will be supplied uninterruptedly. Many consumers panicked as rumours spread and lined up vehicles at filling stations.
A petrol shortage was reported in some filling stations as the demand shot up suddenly, but there was no shortage of diesel.
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Union Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna observed it was an artificially created shortage. Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he said the fuel was not distributed yesterday as it was a Poya holiday, but the distribution will continue today.
A shipment of petrol imported by the Indian Oil Company (IOC) was rejected recently as it was not up to the required standards and another shipment ordered for the CPC has been delayed by several days.There are doubts as to why this delay occured. Then there came a rumour that the CPC TUs have commenced a strike, which is not true, Rajakaruna said while also emphasising the need to develop the storage capacity of CPC to have sufficient buffer stocks.
The Petroleum Ministry said a fuel shipment will arrive on Monday.

Sharif in Pakistan for court hearing
PAKISTAN: Pakistan's ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif appeared in court on Friday, a day after returning from overseas to face corruption allegations that saw him ejected from office and targeted with an arrest warrant.
In a brief hearing in Islamabad, Sharif paid two surety bonds of five million rupees ($48,000) each before leaving under tight security, his lawyer Khawaja Haris told AFP.
The court is set to reconvene on November 7.
The former premier, who was forced out by the Supreme Court in July over a scandal kindled by the Panama Papers leak, had been facing an arrest warrant for failing to appear at hearings since early October.
He has spent most of the time since in London, where his wife is receiving treatment for cancer.
The claims against the prime minister stemmed from the Panama Papers leak last year, which sparked a media frenzy over the luxurious lifestyles and high-end London property portfolio owned by his family.
Sharif and his supporters have denied the allegations and hinted at a political conspiracy driven by the powerful military.
"I am going to Pakistan despite (my wife's) chemotherapy to appear in a bogus case," he told media in London before departing.
"Pakistan's system has contradictions... all this must be changed, now is the time to change it."
He said nothing to media outside the court in Islamabad, but his son-in-law Muhammad Safdar also hinted at a conspiracy.
"Till the time the courts are... free from the fear of some other people, I can't expect any fair trial from this court," Safdar said outside the court. Earlier this week Sharif summoned top officials from his eponymous ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to London for a summit on the party's leadership as legal pressure grows.- AFP

SLCS to conduct breast cancer seminar
A three-hour education session to create awareness among the general public, especially amongst females; on the rise of breast cancer in Sri Lanka, will be conducted by the Sri Lanka Cancer Society (SLCS) at a special seminar scheduled to be held at the SLCS auditorium, Buller's Lane, Colombo 7, on November 7 at 9.00am.
Sri Lankas eminent cancer specialists attached to the Sri Lanka National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) will address the seminar, which will be organized by the SLCS Public Education Division under the supervision of SLCS Public Education Committee Chairperson Indrani Nanayakkara.
The seminar will be followed by a session of questions and answers for the benefit of participants to know more about the early detention of breast cancer, breast cancer symptoms, risk factors and treatments.
According to breast cancer specialists, the cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. The tumor is malignant (cancerous) if the cells can grow into (invade) surrounding tissues or spread (metastasize) to distant areas of the body.
Speaking at a media briefing, Chairperson Nanayakkara highlighted the importance of conducting such a seminar and said this nature of seminars will largely benefit the said vulnerable sector. Quoting research, she said, "Out of all cancer patients, around 28 percent of femalesin our country suffer from breast cancer and it is pathetic to say that incidents of breast cancer are gradually on the rise."
Speaking further, Chairperson Nanayakkara said breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women in the world. About 1 percent of men too are prone to it and according to World Health Organization (WHO), one out of every eight women in the world develop breast cancer.
She said breast cancer is common in women over 35 years of age, never breastfeeding a child is also a risk factor and the risk is greater as a woman gets older.
She said the main objective of conducting this seminar is to educate the participants about the signs and symptoms of breast cancer, the risk factors, how to self-examine breasts, which is very important in early detection and treatment that could lead to cure.
She also reminded the public that the Cancer Society conducts a poly-clinic every second Sunday of the month for screening for breast, cervical and mouth cancers, free of charge.
SLCS Public Education Officer D. W. S. Jayaratne said the Society also conducts awareness seminars in schools and in public offices. He advises the general public and those who wish to get screening done free-of-charge, to come to the Sri Lanka Cancer Society; 37/25, Buller's Lane, Colombo 7.

Smith fumes over mates pick claims
Sydney: Australia skipper Steve Smith on Friday rubbished claims he favours his "mates" as selection looms for the highly anticipated Ashes Test series with England.
Smith is not part of Australia's three-man selection panel, but he has been assailed by former players who believe he gets too much say in Australia's lineups.
The captain hit back strongly at a media conference in Sydney, calling suggestions of favouritism "absolute garbage".
"I'm not a selector, but I certainly speak to the selectors a lot and express my views," Smith told reporters.
"All this rubbish about me picking my mates, it's absolute garbage. I certainly don't agree with that." Questions were raised about Smith's involvement in the New South Wales team decision to drop veteran opener Ed Cowan from a recent game against South Australia, with young Test hopeful Daniel Hughes preferred in his place. Blues coach Trent Johnston said it was one of the toughest decisions of his coaching career to leave out the former Test opener, who was the top run-scorer in last season's Sheffield Shield.
Cowan told Fox Sports: "I don't agree with that selection policy, but it's the Australian Test captain, it's his team."
