I had to introduce myself to my children after tours
Ian Botham on my family values:
I grew up in Somerset and I dont do the inside of the house very well. Im a country boy. I was always out conkering or nicking apples from the orchard or playing in the fields with our dog, Rusty. Home for me was somewhere you went to in your dirty clothes to sleep and eat. My mother was a dental nurse. She knew how to enjoy life. She had a great sense of humour and was always full of beans. My father was an engineer from a military background who was constantly tinkering about with cars and fancied himself as an odd-jobs man. I always got on very well with them.
Im not particularly close to my siblings. I have a brother and two sisters. Im the eldest. Theres a 10-year age gap between me and my brother  and, from the age of 11, I wasnt at home very much; I was on the road playing cricket for Somerset. Professional cricketers spend more time with their team-mates than with their families. With the exception of my wife, I was closer to a couple of my team-mates than anyone else in my life. They were closer to me than brothers. My great mate Viv Richards and I used to spend many an hour chewing the cud.
My father used to sit in the same place in the grandstands so he could watch me bowl. Hed sit up there some days on his own. It didnt matter to him that he was the only one there; he wanted to be there, to enjoy it. Both my parents did. They always encouraged me and they were very proud of what I achieved. Whenever it was my moment, it was their moment, too.
I didnt see my father for the last six months of his life. He had dementia, which is the most horrendous disease. He couldnt remember anything by the end. He had to be sedated to be showered. He just shuffled around and had no idea who anybody was. I didnt want to remember him that way, and he didnt know who I was anyway. There was nothing I could do for him. He was just a shuffling shell. I blotted that out, I didnt want to see it. And I stand by what I did. I dont regret a thing. When I gave the eulogy at his funeral, I was able to remember him the way I wanted to, as the great father that he was.
My fathers illness took years off my mothers life. She had a heart attack that Im convinced was partly due to the stress of everything that went on with him. When she walked into a room where her husband of 50-odd years was and he didnt even know her name  that was soul-destroying.
Becoming a grandad has made me feel younger. Kath and I were married at the age of 21, and so now were in our 60s we have six grandchildren aged between 21 months and 23 years old. We see each other all the time. Everyone lives within 15 minutes of our house. We all enjoy sport and well go hunting, fishing, shooting and golfing together. Were a pretty close family. Im closer to my kids now than I was when they were growing up.
I was away a lot when my kids were young. I used to have to introduce myself to them when I came back from five-month tours. Theyd see me on TV, but it wasnt the same. I can be more hands on with my grandchildren than I was as a father: thats one of the great bonuses.
My 19-year-old grandson Jim, who plays rugby for Wales, has the same determination and single-mindedness that I had, and my son Liam was also a professional sportsman. He spent more time in the Somerset dressing room, growing up, than he did at school. But I dont see myself in either of them. Ive seen too many people try to live their lives again through their children, particularly in sport. Im a great believer in letting kids stand up very quickly on their own two feet and get on with it. But if they need advice or want my help, Ill be there for them.

Australia exploring options to rehabilitate Sri Lankan refugees
Australia is exploring options with the Tamil Nadu government and Sri Lanka to rehabilitate Sri Lankan refugees in the state that will in turn reduce the number of refugees trying to enter Australia through illegal means, a top Australian Border Force official said.
Roman Quaedvlieg APM, Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, met Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan on Thursday and discussed options, including Australian assistance in rehabilitating Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu.
In an interview to The Hindu, Quaedvlieg said: It is in our interest that the size of the diaspora here is reduced; this in turn reduces the probability of further illegal maritime ventures to Australia. We are interested in working with TN govt, NGOs like IOM, UNHCR, to ensure that there is a continuous resettlement programme.
Quaedvlieg said the Tamil Nadu government has been extending its cooperation to Australia in helping reduce the number of refugees who are illegally making their way to Australia by sea. There is a large diaspora of Sri Lankan Tamils who have sought refuge in Tamil Nadu; some of them have sought to enter Australia through illegal maritime means.
According to him, there are about 100,000 refugees in India, some of whom want to go back to Sri Lanka, while some have integrated themselves with the Tamil society in the State. There are some who were born here who wouldnt want to go back to Sri Lanka.
Out of that cohort, there have been some who leave these shores and travel to Australia by boats through organised people smuggling ventures, he said.
He added that while Australia was criticised for turning back the boat people  refugees who arrive in boats  he said the country had the third-largest pro-rata number of refugees.
We are escalating our refugee programme to 18,750 refugees per year. Over and above that, we took in 12,000 extra Syrians last year, Quaedvlieg said.
Earlier in the day, the Australian Border Force Cutter Ocean Shield arrived at the Chennai Port. The vessel will be in Chennai till Saturday during which time various events are planned with the Indian Coast Guard for developing inter-operability between the two maritime forces. Ocean Shield was one of the many vessels that took part in the extensive search of the ill-fated MH 370, a press release said. The Hindu

Civil security service providers should be regulated: Fonseka
Regional Development Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka said a proper methodology has to be formulated to turn civil security service providers into professional organisations.
The minister was delivering the keynote address at the Sri Lanka Security Service Providers Association CEOs Forum held yesterday in Colombo.
Sri Lanka has a large number of private civil security service providing companies. Most of them engage in providing security to private and government organisations. These companies have to be regulated to ensure that they provide a quality service to the public, he said.
He said security personnel in private and government firms have to provide a standard service for them to gain more job recognition. They have to be more disciplined, punctual and ready to face any situation at any time, he said.
Their major objective is to protect civilians and organisations. First of all, they have to identify the needs of the people to serve them better. Training is very crucial aspect for the security service providing industry. Most of the security guards do not have practical knowledge to tackle difficult situations, the minister said.
He said they have to be provided with practical knowledge according to the field they work in. Private firms have to be careful when recruiting security guards as some of them have connections with the underworld.
The security guards basic requirements have to be fulfilled to get a better service from them. A conducive environment should be created for them to perform their duties well, the minister said.

## Title: Construction safety

Construction safety
The collapse of the under-construction Excellency Reception Hall in Wellawatte should be an eye-opener to the construction industry, local bodies and lawmakers. One person was found dead by rescue teams and 27 construction workers were injured in the collapse. Several workers are reported missing, believed to be trapped under the rubble. Rescue efforts by the Armed Forces are underway as we write.
According to the Police, four floors of the building located behind the Savoy Cinema, had initially collapsed with the ground floor threatening to follow. Although police are yet to find the reason for the collapse of the building, this is not the first time that such an incident has occurred in Sri Lanka or the region. One of the most tragic building collapses in recent times occurred in Bangladesh exactly four years ago, when the eight story Rana Plaza building in Dhaka caved in, killing 1,130 people. Miraculously, more than 2,500 people were rescued.
Although one cannot compare the Excellency and Rana incidents in terms of scale, most of the lessons could be identical in both instances. The buildings' owners ignored warnings to avoid using the building after cracks had appeared the day before. Garment workers were ordered to return the following day, and the building collapsed during the morning rush-hour. The head of the Bangladesh Fire Service, Ali Ahmed Khan, said that the upper four floors had been built without a permit. Rana Plaza's architect, Massood Reza, said the building was planned for shops and offices  but not factories.
Once the Excellency rescue efforts are over, a comprehensive investigation into the incident should follow. The Police should call in the experts for the structural and architectural side of the investigation  the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) which has expert personnel and the right equipment. No stone should be left unturned in this probe.
There are already unverified initial reports that builders had violated some terms of the planning permission. If this is true, the builders had committed an inexcusable offence. The Police should get to the bottom of this and question the owner, architect and the contractor without delay to ascertain whether any omissions on their part led to the tragedy.
Colombo is experiencing a construction boom with a large number of high-rises coming up throughout the city. Developers try to expedite the construction due to the competitive nature of the various businesses they engage in (a six-month delay in construction can mean 5-6 lost weddings for a new reception hall). But this could have dangerous consequences.
In the light of this incident, the NBRO along with the Construction Industry Development Authority (CIDA) should re-check all building sites to ascertain whether the contractors had complied with all rules and regulations. Local authorities which actually approve the plans must also get involved in this exercise.
It is essential that potential building owners hand over their construction projects only to CIDA-approved contractors. There is very little awareness on this issue among the public and prospective building owners who usually give their work to unknown companies. The authorities should publish a list of approved construction companies and contractors with their ICTAD grades so that the public can choose them with confidence. Although this is available on the website, a newspaper advertisement is a far better option.
In most other countries, houses and buildings cannot be built by rag-tag bands of non-professionals who sometimes do not follow sound professional advice. The police must probe whether an approved contractor was in charge and whether the building owners had made any unauthorized alternations to the original plans. Some have raised the question whether the ongoing inclement weather affected the structural integrity of the building. This factor too should be taken into account in the probe.
The Police must also examine whether the Excellency workers had been provided with helmets, safety harnesses, non-slip footwear and other construction industry safety gear which they are supposed to wear at all times at the site. Even a one-foot fall can be dangerous in a construction site. A helmet can be a saviour  we know that already from motorcycle accidents, but a construction site is no different.
In line with our closing the stable door after the horse has bolted mentality, we realise the importance of safety gear only when an incident takes place. Safety at Work must be a priority for all workers, not just construction workers, but in their case it is much more important.
It is also time for our construction industry to look for safer alternatives to some of the materials used for construction. Asbestos is being phased out and wood is emerging as a serious contender for constructing whole buildings. The Trummens Strand residential project in Vxj, Sweden is the foremost example for a whole wooden building. New fire-resistant wood-based construction materials have the potential to replace the steel and concrete commonly used today. Graphene, the thinnest and strongest new material is also entering the mainstream construction industry. These and other new materials will ensure higher levels of safety both during and after construction, which is every builders aim.

The drain complex in the Kataragama town is clogged with refuse creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes and insects, Abinawarama Viharadipthi Kataragama Chief Adikarana Sanghanayaka Ven. Kapugama Saranatissa Thera said.
The Thera said the unbearable stench emanating from the drain complex keep away devotees from the shrines.
He said thousands visit the Kataragama town daily, and they would contract fatal illnesses due to the unhygienic situation in the town.
The Thera blames the Kataragama Pradesheeya Sabha for the present plight of the drain complex. He said traders complain that they lose sales since their customers now go to the Tissamaharama town for goods.
Kataragama Pradesheeya Sabha Secretary K.L.A.L. Jayatillaka said the refuse water does not flow through the drain complex, He said the system comes under the Road Development Authority and they have to take steps to clean up the complex.
He said the drain complex lacks concrete slabs and garbage falls into the drains obstructing the flow of refuse water. The traders themselves put garbage into the drain complex making matters worse, he said.

Forces, integral part of countrys development - President
Today our tri-forces are not just engaged in national security but they are also an integral part of our development and social activities, President Maithripala Sirisena said addressing the eighth National Ranaviru (War Heroes) commemoration yesterday.
Over 100,000 soldiers as well as civilians lost their lives in the three decade war. The President who stressed that the government would do its utmost duty for the welfare of the soldiers of the war as well as those who are still in service, said the government will ensure that the forces become an even more professional force.
He reassured the families of the dead who had gathered to commemorate their loved ones at Parliament Grounds as well as the current members of the forces that the government would not heed the advice of critics to downsize the forces as they still had a vital role to play.
Many say that the numbers must be reduced but the government will fulfil its responsibility and stand by the forces and strengthen them so they are able to ensure our national security, said the President.
When we had disasters like Aranayake, the Salawa explosion and Meethotamulla, it was the tri-forces along with the police who rendered a great service to the people. They are also involved in tackling the dengue epidemic. Our forces are not only there to fight a war but also involved in delivering their responsibilities towards economic growth and social welfare, he added.
As the dignitaries, parents of the dead war heroes and other invitees stood solemn at the war memorial in Parliament Grounds, the President appreciated the grand sacrifices made by the war heroes who had laid down their life and limb to safeguard the freedom, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country- the second time the country had to fight for freedom since 1948.
As our country moved towards self-sufficiency in the mid 1970s, the terrorists of Eelam started a war, this was lasted 30 years. Our country was not ready for war then but our army, air force, police and navy faced it with much vigour and courage, he said.
We have had temporary setbacks over the years, and at times we had to invite the Indian government to intervene to stop our country from splitting in two. Though many thousands came to our country even they were not successful in defeating terrorism. And it was our soldiers who were trained and equipped locally who took the charge and defeated the terrorists, the President said.
Having acknowledge the sacrifices made by the forces, the President assured that their welfare would always be looked after by the government, We are at present trying to ensure that all war heroes are given a house, he said.
Referring to the disabled soldiers of war, the President reassured them that as they carry the marks of war with them, the government would not forget them, When we see them in our welfare centres and homes, we see their sacrifices and as a nation we offer our immense gratitude. You will be looked after, emphasised the President.

"President Maithripala Sirisena's concept is good governance. His vision is to support the general public to accomplish their needs while protecting democracy of the country," Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faizer Musthapha said.
He was addressing the gathering after inaugurating two projects to construct bridges in the Nagoda and Yakkalamulla areas in the Galle district.
The consensual government we have today was appointed by the general public themselves. We too joined hands with President Maithripala Sirisena for the betterment of all. That is why we were able to initiate such rural development projects for you, he said.
He said that it was essential to uplift the infrastructure in Galle as it is a district supporting the economy of the country. "Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama, who is my friend, knows well about the needs of this area and act accordingly without expecting any political benefits.
I will support him in any means to carry out his development procedure," the minister said.
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister has allocated Rs. 53 million to construct bridges in Udugama, Aluthwatta, Galle, Kalumada, and Yakkalamulla.
The late minister Amarasiri Dodangoda had pointed out the need for these bridges, but it had been inactive so far. Minister Faiszer Musthapha took immediate steps to provide necessary provisions to initiate the projects, he said.

House followed procedure in compliance with Constitution, elections law: Speaker
Court ruling on Geethas Parliamentary seat:
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday stated that Parliament followed the normal procedure in compliance with the Constitution and elections law when conveying the Appeal Court ruling disqualifying MP Geetha Kumarasinghe from holding a seat in Parliament, to the Elections Commission.
The Speakers Media Division issuing a press release said there had been no undue urgency or delay by Parliament in making this communication.
The release was in reply to various statements that the Speakers move to inform the Elections Commission over the court ruling disqualifying MP Geetha Kumarainsghe was faulty and that he has acted on the agenda of the Government.
When a seat in Parliament falls vacant due to some reason, informing that to the Elections Commission immediately is a task assigned to the Secretary General of Parliament, the release stated.It clarified that the ruling regarding Geetha Kumarasinghes Parliamentary seat was conveyed to the Speaker on May 3 and after consulting the Attorney General, it was referred to the Elections Commission by the Secretary General of Parliament on May 8 for further action.
The relevant ruling had not been subjected to any reconsideration or stay by any superior court up to that point, the release explained.
Thus, we point out that any claim by any party that informing the Elections Commission about the ruling was faulty and that the Speaker has acted on the agenda of the government, is a total distortion of facts or one made out of ignorance. The Speaker in the communiqu further reiterated his commitment to protect the rights of all Parliamentarians.

How replays and close-ups reflect society
What we see when we watch football::
In 1972, four half-hour episodes on the BBC attempted to change how we approached visual culture and how we saw the world around us. John Bergers Ways of Seeing was a landmark in the history of arts broadcasting and education. Berger, an art critic, playwright and Booker Prize-winning novelist, who fought against injustice and wrote articles and essays on society and politics, passed away in January this year. This piece is not an obituary or analysis of his works; it is about football, or as Berger would perhaps have put it, what we see when we watch football.
On 13 June 2014, Holland handed defending world champions Spain a humiliating 5-1 defeat. In the days that followed, the image dominating newspapers, social media and TV channels was that of Robin van Persie suspended mid-flight, right after heading the ball that would beat Iker Casillas and open the Dutch scoring spree. It was a magnificent feat of athleticism resulting in one of the most spectacular goals in World Cup history. But what do we make of the image
For a person who had not watched the match (or replays or highlights clips), the whole game would be condensed into that one image. They would never know of the opening goal  Xabi Alonsos penalty  nor would they know anything of the other four Dutch goals. Given the importance given to that one image, they would perhaps assume that Van Persies goal was the winner when in fact it was an equaliser. About the goal itself, they would also not know that Daley Blind had provided the assist  a fantastic one at that.
One would think the true context of the image could only be understood by a person who had watched the match. However, how far is that possible either The image that we see on our TV screens or the monitors of our laptops and tablets is taken by a mounted camera that moves. This movement makes a lot of difference on how we view the game, for the focus of the image and therefore our eye is always on the ball. When Blind has the ball, our complete attention is focused on him  we do not notice the moment when Van Persie begins his run, neither do we notice how Arjen Robben draws away Gerard Piqu from Van Persies path.
If one stretches the idea of context further still, it is easy to conclude that only a person who knew that Spain had beaten Holland in the final of the previous World Cup, or knew that Van Persie, Blind and Holland manager Louis van Gaal were scheduled to be reunited at Manchester United right after the World Cup  in short, a fan of the sport  would understand the importance of the goal and the celebration that followed: Van Persie high-fiving van Gaal  another photo that went viral on social media.
A photograph is the result of a photographers decision that an instant is worth recording. In his essay Understanding a Photograph, Berger explains that the essence of a photograph is the simple message: I have decided that seeing this is worth recording. According to Berger: A photograph, while recording what has been seen, always and by its nature refers to what is not seen. It isolates, preserves and presents a moment taken from a continuum.
So, what is missing from the Flying Dutchman photo of Van Persie is everything that led up to that moment. While the photo invokes all that is missing from it, this invocation is only realised and understood by the viewer who has prior knowledge of the context and larger background.
At the heart of any football match is the concept of space and time. How each player reacts to these two factors determines how good they are as footballers. In Brilliant Orange, David Winner describes a photo taken at the De Meer stadium in 1995, the year Van Gaals Ajax team was the best in Europe: Tearing forward, the Ajax shadow striker Jari Litmanen has the ball at his feet near the centre-circle. Ten metres ahead of him, centre-forward Patrick Kluivert is a ball of coiled energy, surrounded by defenders, but poised to make his move. Left-winger Marc Overmars and right-winger Finidi George are already running into space. Behind Litmanen, the three other members of the midfield diamond that day, Edgar Davids on the left, Arnold Scholten on the right and Winston Bogarde behind, are advancing with cool menace.
The photo was taken by Hans van der Meer to depict what he calls the moment of tension. There are one or two moments when a situation develops and you understand something will happen, explains Van der Meer. This is the moment of tension, of possibility. Everyone in the crowd shares this tension. The pleasure of going to a football game is that you all feel this together. Its like chess. When newspapers report a chess game, they dont show you the final move. They show you the position 10 moves from the end because that is the most dramatic situation. The midfield is often more dramatic than the penalty area. The moment of the goal is not particularly interesting. What happens just before the goal: that is much more interesting.
Van der Meer does not tend to take photos of matches from the sidelines or from behind the goal. He works high in the stands, usually near the halfway line. This enables him to show space that close-ups taken with long telephoto lenses at ground level fail to capture. In Van der Meers photographs of Ajax, we can see Total Football at its peak.
Similarly, to understand just how organised, structured and disciplined Antonio Contes Italy team were at Euro 2016, it is best to look at this short clip, which was shot from above the oppositions goalposts on a more-or-less static camera that did not zoom in on any particular player.
Instant replays after goals generally show just the assist and the final shot. Here too there is a hierarchy of screen-time. The assist is shown once, maybe twice, but the final shot is shown four or five times from varying angles. The pass that set up the assist is often not shown at all. For a goal resulting from patient build-up play of say 20+ passes, the instant replay would perhaps show only the last two or three passes and the final shot.
The same, however, does not hold for a goal that results from a solo run. In these cases each replay shows  from various angles, at various speeds  how the individual managed to dribble past each of the defenders before slotting in the ball at the back of the net. Football coverage today focuses mostly on the individuality of each player. We live in the age of the spectacle and the constant, unwavering focus on the individual has ensured that players are at all times going through a sort of screen test for the television. Through replays and photos, we are invited to share the ecstatic joy, pain, agony, frustration and disappointment felt by individual players. The performance of a team is even described by statistics on individuals  goals, bookings, tackles made, distance run, dribbles completed and so on.
Somewhere we lose the sense of the team, the collective. For teams such as Pep Guardiolas Barcelona, Jupp Heynckes Munich, Contes Italy and Joachim Lws Germany  which are often described as the outworking of one individuals philosophy  it becomes difficult to ignore the almost clockwork working of the team as one single unit, so they are heralded as revolutionary or spectacular even though the fundamentals of their styles have existed for decades.
Focussing on individual feats of athleticism, heroism or bravado dissolves the concept of a team; it downplays the rigorous training by players, the hours spent at the drawing board by managers before each match and the work put in by the coaches and support staff. Hand in hand with this form of live coverage and photography is the fact that most top-flight clubs today do not have open training sessions. They are closed off to the public and, when on occasion they are opened, the public sometimes has to pay an entry fee.
Stadiums do not allow spectators to bring cameras to football matches. On the other hand, clubs playing non-league football or in the lower leagues freely allow the use of cameras. Photos of these matches are usually significantly different. Taken mostly from the stands, many of these photos are full shots of the pitch. There are fewer close-up shots and invariably there will be photos of the winning team celebrating with their fans after the match.
In modern top-flight football, there is a tangible distance between fans and players. These footballers have now been elevated into gods. The stadium has become a sacred space  tellingly, Chelsea want their new stadium to be a cathedral of football  where the supporter can witness the gods do battle, but not make any form of political statement. The sacred arena is not to be polluted with earthly, mortal things such as society and politics.
The art book publisher Taschen produced a book on football photography in the 1970s called Age of Innocence. It was an apt title as the 1970s were footballs last gasp before big-money corporate entities swallowed it up. The decade marked the final time footballers were were still, at some level, our lads. As Ed Vulliamy wrote in his review of the book: There was an innocence, not least in the presumption by thousands of teenagers from Merseyside that one could saunter down to London and watch a Cup final by bunking in.
The first World Cup to be broadcast on television was that of 1954. In the early days of the video camera, football matches were generally covered by two cameras. The intention was to document the event rather than uphold the spectacle. With the 1966 World Cup in England, everything changed. This was partly because the host country had one of the worlds best TV networks at the time. Moreover, the nature of the broadcasting contracts ensured a more direct involvement of TV companies in the tournament.
Whole tournaments could now be condensed into single images invoking the prime spectacle  Bobby Moore on the shoulders of his England team-mates holding the Jules Rimet trophy aloft (1966), Jairzinho lifting Pel up as the latter looks directly at the camera with a clenched fist in the air (1970), Franz Beckenbauer grinning as he lifts the World Cup trophy (1974), Daniel Passarella being carried by a crowd(1978) and so on.
The close-up photo has also given sponsors a chance to show off their logos. As football became a fully fledged business opportunity in the era of the Premier League and Champions League, it was only a matter of time before players were given a compulsory yellow card for taking off their shirts. A removed shirt, of course, means the corporate giant that sponsors the team misses out on screen time when the camera closes in on the player.
Close-up shots are not inherently bad, but the way the action is covered is helping to create a mystical cult of genius around footballers, which in turn influences the economics and politics of the sport. If we want to reclaim football from corporations that alienate fans from the teams they support, it might be worth looking at the game in a different way.

HR protection govts concern: Sajith
Foreign advice deemed redundant:
Counsel from foreign nations on the protection of human rights is unwarranted as the government has considered its protection as its prime duty and responsibility, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
He was addressing a meeting after laying foundation stones for the Ekamuthupura housing scheme to be built for youth representing all communities at Kappalthurai, Trincomalee recently. Minister Premadasa and Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan laid the foundation stones for the housing scheme.
Premadasa said this was the 363rd model village launched by the government.
Three housing schemes were launched in the Trincomalee district. Work on 500 new model housing schemes will be started before the end of this year, he said.
Premadasa said Ekamuthupura could be described as a symbol of the governments efforts to promote communal and religions harmony and reconciliation in the country.
Opposition Leader Sampanthan said he could recall the opening of a new housing scheme named Vipulananda in Kuchchuweli by Minister Sajith Premadasas father President R. Premadasa when he was Housing Minister in 1967.
Sampanthan said the untimely death of President Premadasa was a national loss as he was a leader with great foresight who came to the assistance of homeless and unemployed people through his model housing and garment industries programmes. Eastern Province Chief Minister Nazeer Ahmed, Provincial Minister Ariyawathie Galappathty and Parliamentarian Imran Maharoof were also present.
Minister Premadasa also distributed housing loans among 24 families and masonry equipment and uniforms among 88 masons under the Shilpeeya Saviya programme.

Kandy may be absolutely football mad, but most of its die-hard fans have rarely come closer to bringing the game back to the position where it once enjoyed. Recent weeks have seen several former footballers make the unexpected move of relocating football. Kandy football league has had a rocky history. But today it is allegedly marred by corruption, weak management, poor promotion, which at times leaves supporters wondering. To make matters worse the 2016 tournaments have still not been concluded. The 2017 AGM has not been held. It was nice to see, last Sunday veterans of Kandy and Mawanella in action. The two teams were called as Masters XI. Kandy Masters edged out Mawanella Masters by 2 goals to 1.

Khalid Latif 'given bat grips by bookie' to indicate fix
LAHORE May19: The Pakistan Cricket Board on Friday said it had seized bat grips given to Khalid Latif by a bookmaker which the Islamabad United opener was allegedly supposed to use to indicate he would participate in a spot-fix.
The 31-year-old batsman stands accused of attempting to spot-fix, accepting an offer by a bookmaker which he did not report, and luring other players into the conspiracy. His case is currently being heard by a three-member tribunal convened to adjudicate on the scandal which emerged during the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in the United Arab Emirates in February and March.
Fast bowler Mohammad Irfan and spinner Mohammad Nawaz have already been banned for six months with six suspended, and one month with one suspended, respectively and fined after they confessed to failing to report meetings with bookmakers.
Khalid and three other players -- Sharjeel Khan, Shahzaib Hasan and Nasir Jamshed -- are also provisionally suspended on various charges and face bans ranging from five years to life if found guilty.
One (piece) of ... evidence is that we seized the bat grips that (a) bookie had given and they were seized from Khalid's kit bag, PCB lawyer Taffazul Rizvi told reporters.
Spot-fixing involves attempting to determine the outcome of a specific part of a match rather than the overall result, and is therefore harder to detect than match-fixing. AFP

Lessons from History
Regime Change in Ceylon: 1815:
The West won the world, not by the superiority of its ideas, values or religion but, rather, by its superiority in applying organised violence. Westerners often forget this fact, non-westerners never do
- Samuel R Huntington
History matters. Obeyesekere relates events, two centuries after they had occurred and a century after the Russian Revolution. Yet they are all so contemporary! Confused by memories, living in a very unpredictable past and troubled by Fukuyama's statement that all had ended, Obeyesekere has given a fillip to re-interrogating the relevance of history. Both Hegel and Marx considered History to be teleology, moving to a purpose. The impact of Portugal and Holland on Sri Lanka was akin to the placid non-movement in a cemetery: 1815 regime change, headed by the leading country of the Industrial Revolution, promised traction to a stalled Hegel and Marx.
It is desirable to learn history, but, it is more enchanting to make it. Needed societal change- the making of history- takes place, not by pensively contemplating the navel or delivering profound statements from pulpits or their equivalents, but through actions which necessarily entail violence and pain. History making without violence is like having rice without a spicy curry. Force is the midwife for every old decaying society pregnant with the new. It is a birthing of history.
A regime change was introduced by the British in 1815, in the governance arrangements of the Kandyan Provinces of Ceylon (Sri Lanka, since 1971). Obeyesekere is the recorder of the 1815 birth event. Obeyesekere claims that the 1815 regime change in Sri Lanka is, probably the most momentous event in Sri Lankan history. The British, pushing democratic slogans and expressing concerns for the People, were specialists at inducing violent regime change round the world, all the while preaching morality. In 1952, the elected prime minister of Iran- Mossadeg- was removed by Britain, claiming popular demand. He was replaced by the reviled ex-Shah, booted out earlier to huge acclaim by the People. (Iran is yet paying the price for this British atrocity). Today, Britain is in Afghanistan fighting to introduce democracy, despite being booted out of that country on four occasions.
The 1815 regime change is a 9/11 event. A 9/11 event is not an individual's biography writ large, a great man's involvement in making history; history is not biography. A 9/11 event is a fulcrum point, giving the future a possibility, like the seething promise offered in 1917, which begat the Bolshevik revolution. A successful 9/11 event leads to all encompassing systemic changes, a full blown rehash of all aspects of the prevailing political economy of a society- politics, power relations, economics, social relations and culture. It could be progressive or retrogressive, depending on the value system of the viewer. History is tenacious, more than Fukuyama would care to know. 9/11 is a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. Unfortunately, Obeyesekere's study restricts itself to the input- the mechanics of take-over of territory but not the stabilisation of take-over- for example, the inhuman crushing of the reaction to 1815, or, the output- long term exploitation of the resources taken over. If not for the regime change of 1815, today's Sri Lanka would be a Nepal.
Prior to 1505, Sri Lanka's migrant streams were sourced from within the Indian sub-continent. From 1505, this migrant catchment widened, to cover the European continent. After 1505, the Portuguese and the Dutch ruled the Maritime Provinces of Sri Lanka, for periods of 150 years. In 1796, the British East India Company took over the Maritime Provinces from the Dutch, under a diplomatic deal called the Treaty of Amiens, and incorporated them as part of the Madras Presidency, a commercial company exercising sovereignty! (It is a supreme irony that this company, is, today, fully owned by an Indian citizen). This bastardly governance arrangement could not last: in 1802, this brand was re-imagined and nationalised. The Maritime Provinces were then placed under the British colonial secretary. There were now two polities in Sri Lanka, the Maritime Provinces under the British and an independent Kandyan Kingdom, under her own King. (The map on page 24 presents the cartography).
British authorities
Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, (SVR) (1798-1815), the King of the Kandyan Provinces and Frederick North (1798-1805), the Governor appointed by the British authorities to head of the newly acquired Maritime Provinces, assumed their positions of responsibility in 1798. SVR and North sequentially succeeded by Maitland (1805-1811) and Brownrigg (1812-1820)), were the dramatis personae in this gripping prose drama written by Obeyesekere. From the beginning, the only objective of the British was to make the Kandyan Kingdom a subordinate political entity to the British crown, mostly for international reasons, and prevent the Kandyan King from breaking out of her landlocked geography. This was Britain's dedicated imperial project. The objective of the Kandyan Kingdom was the opposite. It was a zero-sum game. The fall of redoubtable Tipu Sultan of Mysore in 1799, further whetted North's appetite for Kandyan conquest.
The British tried many soft approaches to gain her objective, primarily using the talent of a Cambridge educated intelligence chief, John D'Oyly, working under Maitland and later Brownrigg. Without suffering any moral anguish, he cynically catered to the whimsical self-development objectives of leading Kandyan nobles. He suborned personalities and dissatisfied Kandyan upper strata, which included Pilimatalawe- the first Adigar-, and later Ehelepola, his successor. The British sponsored pretenders to the Kandyan throne- Muttuswami was one of them, pushed one-sided draft treaties, supported anti-Tamil programmes in the Kandyan areas. There were demonising psychological warfare campaigns- psycho-ops- to induce mass sentiment change against the King. Using a copious flow of alternative facts, SVR was painted a foreigner, an unacceptable Tamil. There was an active disinformation drive. When everything failed, the British opted for the hard approach of war.
The first, the 1803-1804 war, was a humiliating defeat for the British, North having to declare martial law in his own Maritime Provinces. The British partially burnt down the Dalada Maligawa, a precursor to the ashing of the Jaffna Library. Obeyesekere records these hard and soft strategies in meticulous detail. Eventually, persistent British efforts bore fruit, SVR falling victim to multiple dark arts of subversion. The ethic of the playing fields of Eton were not too evident in these strategies. The deck was stacked too heavily against the King. The British declared war again in 1815 on trumped up charges. It ended shortly and swiftly.
After SVR's defeat, he departed to Vellore, drummed into exile by the British, supported by a bunch of undercutting and collaborating Kandyan aristocracy, Ekneligoda being the despicable worst. A Shakesperean dramatist could have written an entrancing play of this period, portraying the interplay of intrigue, violence, power, ambition, betrayal, treachery and sheer bloody-mindedness. As Obeyesekere drily remarks, the European world at that time, and in our own times, was a world of violence and bloodshed, and it needed a great deal of self-deception to say that the British of 1815 was the exemplar of tolerance and humanity, as the British like to represent themselves. With SVR's departure, the long and distinguished history of Sri Lanka as an independent country was over, ended with her evisceration by Kandy's brightest and the best.
Kumarihamy's family
From all accounts, SVR was a popular king devoted to infrastructure development, a compulsive builder of dams, ponds, and irrigation works. He rebuilt the Dalada Maligawa, partially burnt by British forces in the 1803-04 war. He built the Octogon and the Kandy Lake. He had a spacious vision for a Cosmic City of Kandy, like the vision the government has for today's Colombo city. He had a reputation for sensuality, indulgence, depravity, brutality and evil which could partly be a labelling effect, produced by propaganda spurning any sense of objectivity. He had his enemies, who were determined to bring him down and replace him with one of their kind, if they could decide who that person was to be. SVR was the Premadasa of his age, the latter surviving a deposition by impeachment. An example offered of SVR's evil, was the Pounding Episode, the cruel punishment imposed on Kumarihamy, the wife of first Adigar, Ehalepola.
Kumarihamy's family tragedy occupies significant space in Obeyesekere's narrative, as it should. It is an example of the building of a myth model. According to Obeyesekere, myth models are those forms of life with an event from a powerful story or a myth which is then employed in a variety of contexts. Myth is sometimes equated with falsehood but in Obeyesekere's specific usage, it deals with profound or symbolic truths that nevertheless operate in everyday life------Thus a myth model occurs when some powerful event from the past is replicated in the present, the latter becoming a myth model based on the former.
The Pounding Episode is an example of the visceral simplicity of myth formation. Kumarihamy, was the wife of the first Adigar (Chief Minister) Ehelapola. Ehelapola succeeded Pilimatalawe, against whom there was a proven case of traitorous relationships with the British. Pilimatalawe was unmasked, tried and executed, after which Ehelepola was appointed to the post. With the British, whose unremitting endeavour was the deposition of SVR, Kandy became the intrigue capital of Sri Lanka. Hot- house Kandy was the equivalent of Vienna of post WWII intrigue- depicted well in Orson Welles's black and white film, The Third Man or Berlin of the cold war- depicted in Le Carre's The Man Who Came In from The Cold. Rumour and counter rumour swirled, many of them centering round the unsated ambitions of Ehelapola. Eventually, these rumours were confirmed. Before the King could take action, Ehelapola fled to Colombo, without obtaining the King's approval to leave Kandy, which he was obliged to do.
Rule of law
In such a situation, the law was that the family could be incarcerated as hostages, pending the return of the fugitive or suffer the same penalties as a traitor. Ehelapola did not return and the rule of law was applied. Obeyesekere quotes Thoen, a Dutch gunner who reported that, four children of Ehelapola Adigar had their heads cut off, the youngest being torn from their mother's breast for the purpose. Their bodies were dragged through the streets of Kandy and the heads put into a mortar, the pestle of which was forced into the mother's hand, and she was obliged to pound the mangled bodies of her own children. (It was said later that she had agreed to do so under duress. If she had not complied, she was threatened with ravishment by a Rodiya, an unheard of indignity). She, with three more women relations of the Adigar, were then led to the brink of a large tank, by some female slaves of the palace, their hands and feet being bound a stone tied round the neck of each. They were thrown into the lake, where their bodies still remain. Obeyesekere, in the best traditions of a critical academic, casts doubt on the pounding episode.
Thoen was not an eye witness to render this vivid account, as he was the prisoner of the King, incarcerated in distant Uva. Father Ehelapola, did not refer to the pounding nor did D'Oyly, though, if the story were true, they would have been the first to give it widespread publicity. Neither Brownrigg nor Thoen made any attempt to spread this story among the people. The children's beheading did take place but the pounding is untethered by fact.
Obeyesekere attributes the behaviour of some of the Kandyan nobles, like Ekneligoda, to being suffused with Ressentiment. Ressentiment is not a fancy French noun to depict resentment. Obeyesekere's glossary clarifies, Ressentiment as an important term invented by Friedrich Nietzsche, to denote extreme and unrepentant malevolence. In page 306-307, Obeyesekere writes, Ekneligoda is an Iago or Richard III type character and exemplifies what Nietzche brilliantly diagnosed as ressentiment, a man who carries a deep grudge or a sense of indubitable wrong done to him, a person with a venomous eye.
This characterisation is partially correct but misleading. Ressentiment is the psychology of a superfluous person, educated into a sense of hope and entitlement (in Sri Lanka free education) but rendered adrift by his limited circumstances and abandonment, and, thereby, open to feelings of weakness, inferiority and envy, which could ferment into malevolence. He is spiritually unmoored. He could be a member of the JVP, never the Kandyan nobility.
Obeyesekere should be congratulated on his presentation of the complex events of this period and with fidelity. His book should be read not only for the minutiae of the details of the regime change of 1815, but also for the alerts it provides. If history's lessons were not heeded, mankind is surely destined to consume by them.

Lest We forget
War Heroes commemoration:
They gave their tomorrow for our today:
Thousands of valiant service personnel who made the supreme sacrifice to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Sri Lanka were remembered by grateful Sri Lankans around the country.
People in many areas organised religious programmes, blood donation campaigns, alms giving and commemorative events in remembrance of the valiant soldiers who sacrificed their life and limb for the country.
The National War Hero Commemoration was held at the War Hero Memorial yesterday evening under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and parliamentarians representing the government and opposition. President Maithripala Siripala placed floral tributes at the War Hero Memorial as a mark of respect to thousands of Security Forces personnel who made the supreme sacrifice for their motherland.
The War Hero commemorations were also organised by many Provincial Councils during the past few days.
The Security Forces defeated the LTTE terrorists who were demanding for a separate state. The Security Forces succeeded in annihilating one of the most ruthless terrorist outfits in the world.
The terrorists held thousand of people in the North as hostages and they were denied of their all rights. The valiant Security Forces ensured the people's right to live in the North and East by liberating the areas held by the terrorists. Their mission did not end with the victory over terrorism. They made many contributions thereafter to help build the lives of the people who were affected by the war.
The Sri Lanka Army was actively involved in resettlement of people who were displaced by the conflict and they built houses for these people. Their assistance and dedication to uplift the living standards of the people affected by the war in the aftermath of 30 years of terrorism is highly commendable and these brave men have left an indelible imprint in the hearts and minds of the people.

Meet boxer Tuan Nuhar Yahiya
Former St. Michael's College, Polwatte, Colpetty, Ceylon Schools, Ceylon Army, Defence Services and Ceylon boxer Tuan Nuhar Yahiya spoke to the Daily News about his boxing career at his residence at 723/82, Lake Terrace, Athurugiriya.
Q. What is your date of birth and something about your family
A - I was born on 9 June 1942. My father is Mohamed Yahiya a Fire Superintendent at the Colombo Port and my mother is Booba Nona Jassin and she is a housewife. I am the eldest in the family and I have four brothers and one sister and we were living at Old Moor Street, Colombo.
Q. What is your first school
A - I was admitted to St. Anthony's Roman Catholic School Colpetty and my principal was Rev. Sr. Kennis and after passing grade 2, I was admitted to Hameedia Boy School. I was there up to standard six and there I played for the under 14 football team. Later I was admitted to St. Michaels College, Polwatte. There too I was a unanimous choice for the under 15 soccer team. My father encouraged me to play soccer and volleyball.
Q. How did you commence your boxing career
A - At St. Michaels there are two streams English and Sinhala and I was in the English stream. One day a senior boy from the Sinhala stream assaulted one of my class mates and immediately I intervened and had a fight with him. Then our Principal late president of the Ceylon Schools Boxing Association S. K. Gunawardene saw this incident from a two storied building and immediately called two of us and got down two pairs of boxing gloves through our college boxing captain Hector Ekanayake and asked the two of us to put on gloves and fight with each other. Both of us got hammered and he stopped the bout and asked me to report for boxing practices the following day.
Q. Did you inform your parents
A - No. I told my mother that I am attending soccer practices. If my father came to know that I am attending boxing practices he would have never allowed me. At college my coach was Anton Jones and he was called Brown Bomber of Ceylon and Ekanayake too helped me. In our school we had Inter School boxing meets and I beat Vijitha Fernando (later Air Force) and I was selected for the school team. One day when I was practicing I got a blow on my mouth and my lip was swollen. When I went home my father noticed it and I had to come out with the truth. With the injury he hammered me mercifully and I had to go under the drawing room table to escape. But my mother encouraged me without the knowledge of my father.
Q. Did you participate in the Inter School meets
A - Yes. During our time there was an annual boxing fixture versus St. Thomas Gurutalawa and I was selected. I told my mother the truth and told my father that I was going for a soccer match. In my first boxing meet which was in 1960 I lost to Jaleel Khan.
Q. Then what happened
A - I was selected for the Inter Schools Junior ABA meet Under 80 lbs and I had to face about 12 bouts. I became the champion. In the Stubbs Shield meet under 85lbs I was also the champion. In the Up Country Low Country Meet I lost to Michael Bulner of St. Sylvesters. Again at the Stubbs Shield meet I beat Nihal Gunaratne of S. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia, Premachandra, Rahaman of Royal College and Watson of St. Sylvesters. When I beat Nihal Gunaratne a photograph appeared in the Daily News and my father had seen it and showed it to my mother.
After that he did not oppose me for participating in boxing. Whilst at school I joined St. Michaels Boxing Club and my other boxing mates were P. G. Neil (captain), Winston Vanculenberg, M. Jaroof, Jeffrey Vanculenberg, and M. Y. Johoran and S. P. Jayasooriya who joined us later from Prince of Wales' College.
Q. Did you box in the Nationals
A - Yes. I beat Zakaria, Rafaideen of Army and W. R. M. Vincent and in the finals Derrick Gunasinghe in the under 112lbs. I participated in the Novices, Intermediate, Clifford Cup and Layton Cup meets in the Light Fly 108 lbs. In 1963 I was selected along with ten other members to the Ceylon Schools boxing team and toured India for the M. D. Gunasena Trophy. I lost to Tharaj Mithra of Calcutta but we won the trophy. In Madras I beat Nandan Lal in the under 105 lbs, in Kanpur I beat Ababul Majumlal and lost to Lakan Kunda at Calcutta. In the Amateur Boxing meet under 100lbs I lost to Tharaj Mithra of Indian Railways. In the Stubbs Shield meet organized by Sri Lanka Schools at New Town Hall I became the Welter weight under 100 lbs champion.
Q. What was your employment
A - I joined the then Ceylon Army and was attached to the Gemunu Watch. When I was in the Army I was selected for the Asian Games along with H. K. Karunaratne, Winston Vanculenberg, Marzook and Jaroof. But I could not take part due to unavoidable circumstances. Whilst I was in the Army I was unbeaten commencing from Inter Unit, Inter Services and Combined Services and I was awarded and re-awarded Army and Combined Services boxing colours.
Q. Did you coach the Army boxers
A - Yes. I was a player cum coach and Brigadier Hugh Rupasinghe assigned me to coach them. I have produced several boxers of fame for the Army some of them are Y. L. R. Joseph, Nuwagamuwa, W. Silva and M. Osman.
The Amateur Boxing Association selected me for a boxing coaching stint in Korea and Brigadier Rupasinghe supported me but the Army turned down the request. Lalin Fernando and former commander Jerry Silva helped me in many ways in my boxing.
Q. Did you continue to box and coaching in the Army
A - Yes. But unfortunately in 1971 the JVP insurrection broke out throughout the Island and all the sports in the Army was stopped and all of us were deployed in various parts of the country.
Q. When did you retire from the Army
A - In 1986 I retired from the Army and joined Seylan Bank as an Executive Officer and I played rugby for them and I left them in 2002.
Q. Any of your children took up to sports
A - No. I have two sons and two daughters and my wife is a housewife. During my Army career my family was at Diyatalawa and there were not much of possibilities to play and take part in games. Due to this they were not interested.
Q. Who was the most Scientific Boxer you came across during your boxing career
A - No doubt it was Michael Bulner of St. Sylvesters College, Kandy. There were two other boxers whom I was highly impressed with - Jaroof of St. Michaels College and later Army and Gordon Pereira of Carey College and later Air Force. They are scientific and very hardy boxers and they go flat out.
Q. Are you involved in coaching or any other activity now
A - I am attached to the Media Unit of Sri Lanka Ex-Servicemen Association, Bristol Street, Colombo 1 as an English correspondent and our media team carries out news weekly in the Daily News and Dinamina of Ex-Servicemen.
Q. Finally what is the advice you can give to the present day boxers
A - Unlike our time the students are not much of interested in boxing today. Most of them are for cricket and the parents too encourage them. If you are participating in boxing you must be always very calm and never lose your temper in and out of the ring. Boxing is a scientific sport. If you play it to the rules and regulations it's a much disciplined game too. Boxing is for your self defence but never involve it in street fighting if so your opponent can get injured.

Misbah and Younis did more than serve Pakistan  they served cricket
Some retirements leave you feeling older all of a sudden, as if time has just moved on in a leap. There were two such on Sunday night. Misbah-ul-Haq and Younis Khan played their final games, a Test against West Indies at Windsor Park in Dominica.
Younis is the last great batsman of his generation to go. Thirty men scored 4,000 runs in Test cricket in the 2000s. Among the other 29, you can still catch Chris Gayle swishing sixes in franchise cricket, see Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene on the county circuit. The rest are retired, have become coaches, commentators, administrators. Younis, who made his debut in 2000, was the only one still playing Tests. We are not on the brink of the new era anymore but so far into it the one just gone is a business only for historians.
Of course they finished together. Younis and Misbah were one of the great partnerships. They started late, because Misbah became a regular member of the team only in 2009 when he was 34 but still scored more runs together than any other pair of Pakistan batsmen. In the long history of Test cricket, only two pairs scored more runs in partnership at a higher average. Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe were one, Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting the other. Then it is Misbah and Younis, 3,213 altogether, at 68.36. After Allah, his wife and his children, Younis was the one Misbah wanted to thank in his farewell speech. It was a very fine journey with him in the middle, he said. My name will come with his and be remembered in history.
Younis was one of the finest players Pakistan have had, the first to score 10,000 Test runs, the first to score more than 30 Test centuries, his batting characterised by his bloody minded determination to be the last man standing as he once put it, the one who comes in and takes everything on his chest when things get hard for the team. Younis was as tough as they come. He scored five centuries in the fourth innings, more than any other player in history. Since he started, Pakistan have won 28 Tests away from home, outside of the UAE. And in the 24 of those matches he played in, Younis scored 2,826 runs at 94.20, with 10 centuries. Steve Waugh is the only player with an away record anything like it.
Then there is Misbah, a player who was pretty much the Pakistan Cricket Boards last choice to be captain, who has led the team to so many firsts, mosts and onlys. Misbah, who won more Tests than any other Pakistan captain. Misbah, who never lost a home series. Misbah, who became the only captain in history whose team whitewashed England and Australia. Misbah yoked himself so tightly to the needs of the team his career seemed to became one long exercise in self-abnegation. He batted so slow they called him Tuk Tuk but who also scored, one carefree day, the fastest 50 in Test cricket and tied Viv Richards record for the fastest ton.
If it had not been for Younis, Misbah would not have become captain. And if it had not been for Misbah, Younis would not have become Pakistans greatest batsman. The captaincy was meant to be Youniss. He was groomed for it by the PCB chairman, Shaharyar Khan. He picked Younis to be Inzamam-ul-Haqs deputy early in 2005. When the time came for him to take over, before the Champions Trophy in 2006, he refused to do it. He said he did not want to be a dummy captain and, though he never said it in public, the problem was the selectors had insisted on picking Faisal Iqbal when Younis wanted Misbah instead. In 2007, when Inzamam stepped down, Younis refused the job again, because he was so upset by the fallout from the World Cup.
I am still hurt and upset at the sort of hostile reception we have got on our return, Younis said. When your family gets threatening calls and our effigies are burnt and our pictures put on donkeys, I cant lead the team in such circumstances. He finally took on the job in 2009 and won the World T20 that same year. He quit again after he was falsely accused of fixing by a Pakistani politician and his own players turned against him. He even began to suspect they were deliberately losing matches out of spite. In 2010 he was banned for life, part of a cack-handed effort by the PCB to clean up its team. It meant he missed their infamous tour of England that summer.
The life ban lasted only 10 months but by the time he returned Misbah was in charge. Mohammad Yousuf, Shahid Afridi and Salman Butt had done the job in the time in between, one was banned, one quit, and the other was caught fixing. The captaincy was cursed but Misbah lifted it. He led Pakistan to the top of the world rankings for the first time and did it even though his team were stuck in perpetual exile, away from their families and their fans, had lost their two best fast bowlers to spot-fixing bans and their leading spinner after he was called for chucking and made to remodel his action.
Younis, freed from leading, was with him all the way, the bulwark of the batting. There will not be any ready way to replace them. Pakistan will be a shadow of the side they once were for a while yet, just as Sri Lanka have been since Sangakkara and Jayawardene quit.
For all their records, their achievements are not of the kind best expressed in numbers or on lists. Between them they carried Pakistan through the hardest, darkest years and in doing so they did not just serve their country but the sport and all of us who love it.

Muslim Ministers, MPs discuss common strategy
Muslim Ministers and MPs who met yesterday morning to discuss a common strategy to approach the President and Prime Minister on the recent attacks faced by the Muslim community, warn that they would choose to sit independently in Parliament if the Leaders do not take action to rein in extremist groups in the country.
According to a post shared on Muslim Affairs and Postal
Services Minister Abdul Haleems Facebook profile, the Muslim legislators met at his ministry. Their focus has been the recent increase in activity by the Buddhist group; Bodu Bala Sena (BBS).
Over the last week, a series of incidents such as the attack on the Kohilawatte mosque in Sedawatte by an unidentified gang have led the MPs to believe that the BBS might be involved though the attackers are yet to be identified and apprehended. A source at the meeting speaking to the Daily News said that they have sent a letter requesting for a meeting with the President and they hoped that they would get an appointment with the President.
We are not asking for anything special.
All we want is that law and order in this country should be respected that the culprits be apprehended. If not, we will have to take action and be independent,the source said.
The Muslim community which had voted against the previous regime for their apathy towards rising extremist sentiment towards the community finds that the present government too should act more on this matter, the source continued. The present government does not support extremism, but, it feels like they are not doing anything to stop it either, the source said.

New Irrigation Act to be presented
A new Irrigation Act will be presented to Parliament to help expedite irrigation projects expedite, Irrigation and Water Resources Management Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Zoysa said.
He made this observation yesterday at a press conference held at the Irrigation and Water Resources Management Ministry auditorium.
The Minister also said that there was no strong laws passed to protect the thousands of irrigation projects in the country and this Act would fill the void. The Minister also said that he has presented five Cabinet Papers to develop five reservoirs in the country. He also said that they have been presented to the economic committee and added that money is being sought to implement these projects and some sections have agreed to provide funds under public private partnership too.
He said that these water projects are the Gin-Nilwala Water Project, Heda Oya project, Kumbukkan Oya project, Pahala Malwathu Oya Water Project and the Kithul Rogala water project in Batticaloa.
Minister Zoysa said that during the previous regime of Mahinda Rajapaksa failed to implement the Kumbukkan Oya project, but the incumbent government has been able to do it. He added that the same project would irrigate 13,000 acres.
After the era of the Sinhalese kings it was the Maithri-Ranil era which brought a revival of the countrys irrigation system, Minister Zoysa said.
He said that the Irrigation Department and Water Resources Board cleaned all the wells in the Kelany Valley after the flood. He added that the same institutions are providing pure drinking water to the Shalawa area after the explosion there.
The Minister also said that the Water Resources Board has been made into a profit earning institution during the last two years.

The perfect dive in cliff diving
Prelude to Cliff diving World Series - Go with the Flow:
In the fascinating sport of cliff diving the athletes prepare their bodies and minds for years to possibly reach the perfect dive once in their whole career. Sometimes they feel it right from the take-off and sometimes they are surprised by the judges scores. What is true in both situations is this incomparable feeling after the dive and the fact that it is not just about the scores.
I remember the competition where I got those seven 10s from the judges. I was doing really, really well in practice and I remember one of the judges when I came to him and asked how was my dive he was like wow, that was really good. If you do it like that you will get 10s tomorrow from the judges. I went for it in the competition and I felt really, really good. I turned around again, looked at the water and under water it was like wow, I think hes going to give me a 10 and I came up and looked at the judges and I couldnt believe it, really. Orlando Duque has experienced a perfect dive at a very early point in his cliff diving career. In the world championships in 2000, his very first one, he got perfect 10s from the judges.
Its a Guinness World Record that still stands today. Everything had come together that day  the perfect feeling and the perfect score. 10 world championship titles later and the 39-year-old still strives for perfection. When you manage the three elements  take-off, flying in the air, and then the water entry with no splash  its the best feeling in the world. Underwater you know it; youre just so happy already.
However, for two of his closest competitors for the overall title in the Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series, Gary Hunt and Artem Silchenko, its not all about the perfect score. For me doing the perfect dive would feel that it just went perfectly and you just dont feel any impact on the entry and everything in the air seems to flow, explains Gary Hunt, the Brit who leads the 2013 World Series before the final showdown in Thailand at the end of this month. And there are also two different sides to a dive for Russias Artem Silchenko: Of course we dive and everything depends on how the judges like your dive and of course everybody wants five 10s, but for me its how I feel and what I can do to control everything.
The ability to control an action-packed dive from the height of an eight-storey building reaching speeds of up to 90kph doesnt come overnight and the chances of reaching perfection grow with every new day of dedicated training on a physical as well as a mental level. Besides all the technical training that has gone in over the years. Most of the elite group of athletes started diving before entering school. Cliff divers need to be in the right mindset when they walk down to the end of the platform. Its about the right balance between being calm and energetic. You need to be very clear in your head and mainly very relaxed. Its very difficult to get relaxed when youre standing that high and youve got a big dive to do. Its an art. Its a lifetimes work to be able to teach yourself the tricks and the traits to get that perfect dive, says Blake Aldridge, the former British Olympic diver. Just like his competitors, the 31-year-old has learned it the hard way; that perfection comes through failure. Hes landed his back armstand with 2  somersaults and four twists  a dive which when executed perfectly scores 189 points  more than once with his arms up, over-twisted or with a big punch on his chest. This is the time when you start struggling with your dives and your confidence. Artem Silchenko struggled a lot last year with his blind-entry
dive after two hard landings on back and chest, he almost considered ending the season and going back to the pool for more training. But he kept trying and training until he did his dive  a back armstand with 2  somersaults and 2  twists  almost to perfection in the seasons second stop in Copenhagen: four 10s from the five judges, 183 points and a second successive win. I think mentally its really quite a unique sport in that you have to prepare not only for that one perfect dive which is going to happen in three seconds, but the preparation mentally is also that if that dive goes wrong how you prepare for your next dive as well. You really have to clear the decks and focus on the next dive and the next dive after that and not get over-excited or over-down if youre not going down like you want, explains Dr. Donald Kuah, an experienced sports physician specialist and one of the founding practitioners at Sydney Sports Medicine Centre and Sydney Sportsmed Specialists. He has had extensive experience of elite national teams and, as the NSW Institute of Sport Medical Director from 2000 to 2012, was responsible for the states top 700 elite athletes.
I dont know if the goal for myself is a perfect dive every time. I want to enjoy the dive, I want to have fun with the dive. In competition its a little bit different. In competition you have to do as close as possible to the perfect dive, because the judges are very strict. But in general diving, It probably helps sometimes to get a bit of the usual competition pressure off, when you go diving just for the fun of it. It clears the mind and recalls the unique feeling of flying through the air. Its a lot about your natural way of doing things. Its a bit like Roger Federer  okay, you can do great shots but it just looks so smooth when he does it. Its the same thing with diving. A lot of people can do these amazing acrobatic skills, but some are a little bit more smooth and graceful than others, says cliff diving expert Joey Zuber.

Rashen, Reshan continue Bandaranayake legacy at Trinity
Two young Trinity College ruggerite brothers, Rashen and Reshan N A H Bandaranayake who are performing quite well for their Alma Mater in
the present school rugby season are the fourth generation ruggerites of a family with a rich sporting history at Trinity college.
Their farther Rajiv Bandaranayake was a Rugby Lion and played for Trinity as a tree quarter in 1987.
He was also a jersey winner in 1986. Rashen and Reshan's great grand father Ananda Hulugalle Bandaranayake was a malty faceted sports personalty who excelled in both rugby and cricket. He captained Trinity cricket team in 1953 and was a Cricket Lion.
He represented school rugby team in 1952 and 1953 where he played as a full back. He also received school colours for rugby and known to be a very popular character in Trinity sports.
The family sporting tradition continued to another generation, extending to over 100 years as the great great grand father of Rashen and Reshan, Jinadasa Hulugalle Bandaranayake went on to excel both in rugby and cricket during his school days. He captained Trinity cricket team in 1919 and entered Trinity Lion-hood as a Cricket Lion.
His school rugby career stretches from 1918 to 1919, but there were no clue about the position he played.
This fascinating sporting legacy of Bandaranayake family is a rare feat and might be the only its kind of family sports record in Sri Lnkan school sports history.
The elder brother Rashen is a third year player and plays as a full back while his younger brother Reshan is a three-quarter, playing in his first year for Trinity first xv.

Royal go as favourites but history is against them
73rd Bradby Shield  1st leg in Kandy:
Will history repeat itself with grisly accuracy when number eight Nathan Yees Trinity College Kandy team lock horns with fly half Ovin Askeys Royal College Colombo team at the Trinity Sports Complex in Pallekelle, Kandy at 4:15pm today.
The question is whether Royal who go out as firm favourites will be able to win and thereby win the Singer A division league rugby championship as well as the Bradby Shield.
If historical statistics means anything then the odds are stacked heavily against this years Royal team as they prepare for the first leg of the 73rd Bradby Shield encounter in Kandy.
1990 was a year of great expectations for Trinity rugby much like 2017 has been. Both teams were coming after disappointing seasons in the previous years. The 1990 Trinity team was expected to reach the same heights that sensational flanker cum captain Tyrel Rajapakses champion team in 1987 and the 2017 team is following in the footsteps of the 2014 team that last brought home the Bradby for Trinity.
Prop forward Ravi Kalpage led the team in 90 and fly half Tharinda Ratwatte in 2014. Both teams boasted of arguably the best back divisions in schools rugby that year, with the 90 side putting up over 200 points and the 2014 side bettering that with approximately over 350 points.
Coming into the Bradby the 1990 side had just one loss against the mighty Thomians.
In todays match if Royal could adjust themselves to the conditions early in the game, they could always head towards a good lead. Much will depend on how Royals heavy and mobile pack, which includes highest try scorer of the ongoing league Hamza Reeza who occupies the all-important hookers berth will fare. If their halves combination of young Nikhil de Silva and captain Ovin Askey link effectively, then they should be able to feed the Royal three quarters more often. At the same time, Trinity captain Nathan Yee playing in todays game as a third row forward and his presence in the pack should make exchanges even in the forwards play. Yee will pair off with Keshawa Palayangoda and Kanesha Alwis in the third row.
Trinity teams, over the years, have always produced penetrative back divisions and there is no exception this time too. Royal have already finalized their team for the big game while Trinity is yet to decide one final slot in the three quarter line up.
Customary, the seasons track record does not matter much in the Bradby series. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to have a look at how the two teams have fared this season.
Royal have won eight matches they have played this season. But two of those eight wins have been close games with the best being their exciting 35-19 win over Wesley last week. They also had a close 18 points to 15 win over Dharmaraja. Their seasons record is enriched with convincing victories over D.S. Senanayake College (49-07) and Zahira College Maradana (65-14). They only lost to Isipathana (17-22).
In contrast, Trinity too has almost an equally good record, except for that shocking (13-15) defeat they had at the hands of sensational St. Peters College. Except for that loss Trinity has shaped well this season, winning seven out of eight matches. They had good wins against Wesley (64-24) and St. Josephs (30-25). But their richest harvest this season came in the game against Prince of Wales Moratuwa which the Lions won 94 points to 9.
The Reid Avenue boys are the current custodians of the coveted Bradby Shield, named after the late Royal principal E.L. Bradby, who donated the shield to the Royal-Trinity rugby series in 1945. The winners of the shield are determined on aggregate of points after two legs played in Kandy and Colombo. The Royal-Trinity rugby series began way back in 1920 but the Bradby Shield was introduced only in 1945 after which it turned out to be a two-leg affair. The first ever inter-school rugby match between the two teams in 1920 was won by Trinity which beat Royal by 26 points to nil. The first leg of the inaugural Bradby Shield encounter was won by Royal 3-0 but their joy was short lived as Trinity won the second leg 6-0 and with it became the first holders of the Bradby.
The highest ever aggregate in the Bradby series was registered in 2002 when Royal led by Zulki Hamid massacred hapless Trinity team 39-nil in Colombo in the first leg and 44-nil in the second leg in Kandy to take the shield with a record aggregate of 83-nil.
Of the 72 encounters played so far Trinity takes the lead with 39 wins to Royals 31. There were two ties in the series which was witnessed in 1992 and last year in 2016.
The 2015 Royal College number eight Supun Warnakulasuriya remains to date as the only player in the history of Bradby shield to score four tries in a single match which he did in the second leg at Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue. Incidentally he is the present team manager of the Royal College rugby team.

Safeguarding democracy
It is clear that we have to face the sad truth. From the time of its victory with a mass uprising at the Presidential election of January 2015, the Yahapalana government leaders have been steadily losing the politically motivated campaign to keep the masses on its side. This is mainly on account of its inability to show the general public that it is a dynamic and can-do government that has a plan and is implementing its plan. They started with many dimensional investigations and several programmes to win over the Tamil speaking minorities.
While progressive masses were jubilant, Mahinda camp screamed and shouted in fear. There was the appearance that a structural change in the state machinery is taking place. But before long both leaders of Yahapalanaya was talking about war heroes in Mahinda camp and the unity of the business community. The main problem is that they are not communicating a coherent message about their vision and plans to the people.
In this stalemate situation, many who supported the democratic revolution has already disillusioned. In a recent meeting of mass leaders who sacrificed to build the democratic upsurge that toppled the Mahinda regime, such as Professor Sarath Wijesooriya, Saman Rathnapriya, Azath Salley, strongly criticized the leaders of Yahapalana government. The main criticism is that the leaders of Yahapalana are compromising with the fascistic leaders.
Marxist leaders
The problem of liberalism has been exposed by Marxist leaders such as Marx, Lenin and particularly by Trotsky. In the struggle for democracy the vacillation of liberal leaders helped to right wing, dictatorial elements to take power. In this situation it is the duty of the left and workers' leaders to intervene positively to carry out the tasks of democratic revolution. Strangely enough, during the Second World War it was Winston Churchill who countered the vacillations of liberalism of conservative leaders.







Winston Churchill
Churchill was not a leftist of any kind and he was thrown into wilderness during the 1930s because of his opposition to increased home rule for India and his resistance to the 1936 abdication of Edward VIII. However Churchill took the lead in warning about Nazi Germany and in campaigning for rearmament. He understood the nature of fascism better than Chamberlin. On September 3, 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany following the outbreak of the Second World War, Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, the same position he had held during the first part of the First World War. As such he was a member of Chamberlain's small War Cabinet.
In this position, he proved to be one of the highest-profile ministers during the so-called Phony War, when the only noticeable action was at sea and the USSR's attack on Finland. Churchill at the outbreak of the Second World War, he was again appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. Following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain on May 10, 1940 became Prime Minister. His speeches and radio broadcasts helped inspire British resistance, especially during the difficult days of 194041 when the British Commonwealth and Empire stood almost alone in its active opposition to Adolf Hitler. He led Britain as Prime Minister until after the German surrender in 1945. If Yahapalana leaders are not prepared to listen to leftists they can at least follow the example of Churchill.
Joint Opposition
Mahinda camp believes that last May Day was a turning point. Apparently they were waiting for the day to show their might. Vulgar attraction created by money, liquor and travelling facilities was bogus affair from top to bottom. May be it is a display attractive only to the miserable and marginalized. However, the fascistic Joint Opposition was partially successful in political and psychological terms when it used media to make people believe that it succeeded in ensuring large scale participation of its supporters at its May Day event; but the evening news explained well how this show was carried out!
Fascistic politics are not based on reality. Hence they are happy, so their programme is implemented. Since then they have increased many fold the sabotage actions. Unfortunately leaders of Yahapalana government are undisturbed about the negative development taking place. Some say they are our confident and dismiss Mahinda group activities as primitive politics rejected by civilized humans. Of course there was some uncertainty whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to Lanka to join the country in its celebration of the International Day of Vesak would be turn embarrassing to the host government. Prior to his visit fascistic politicians such as Weerawansa, Gammanpila and chauvinist sectarian leaders from the Sinhala majority community called for black flag protests. This was to be done as a protest against what they called Indian expansionist actions.
Two controversial matters currently being negotiated between the two countries are the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) and the Trincomalee harbour project that revolves around the lease of oil tanks. While conscious workers understand that if properly handled ETCA could be helpful to expand the job opportunities and open the Indian market for our goods, there has generated a formidable opposition amongst sections of the local business community and professionals. The general belief is that medical doctors of the government medical doctors association is opposing because they fear that they will not be able to withstand Indian competition.
Those who sought to give an ulterior motive to the Indian premiers visit were also able to draw on memories of the Indian interventions recorded in Mahavamsa up to that of Rahul Ghandi. All these are depicted as supportive of Tamil Hindu community in the country, and chauvinist political campaigns are launched to save the land of Sinhala Buddhism.
Presidential election
Mahinda group is expecting to grow from the position they had in the last Presidential election. At the last Presidential election held in 2015, nearly 5.8 million people voted for former president Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is assumed that most of them continue to keep their trust and confidence in the former president. They say the crowds that thronged Galle Face Green would account for a small fraction of that political base. That day, Joint Opposition members claimed that public participation at their event was more than those of all other May Day rallies combined together. What was needed was organisational skill and determination to bring them down to one location, and of course, the financial resources to pay for their travel.
It appears that the Joint Opposition considered more to be at stake for their futures, do or die event, and so outdid the others in money and effort to gain the psychological edge; Having done that they are going for the kill. Bodu Bala Sena is the front line of Mahinda movement!

These portraits was on display on the opening day of Middlesex versus Surrey County Championship game. The pair have had multiple sittings with the painter Antony Williams in the Writing Room at Lords. Sangakkara and Jayawardenes paintings will be placed alongside Sir Viv Richards and Glenn McGrath.
The official website of the Home of Cricket quoted Sangakkara saying, I was humbled when I was asked to sit for the portrait commissioned by MCC. It is a great honour to be on the walls at Lords. I wanted to know how I would be represented through Antonys eyes; not just my expressions or my physical appearance but how he would interpret me as a whole.
He further added, Having seen the final portrait, I was so very pleasantly surprised, unnerved and a bit embarrassed seeing myself in a frame on canvas but thoroughly happy with the work done.
Adam Chadwick, MCCs Curator of Collections said, MCC regularly commissions portraits of players who have captivated a generation of cricket fans in all forms of the game, all around the world, and both Kumar and Mahela fit the bill perfectly. I am delighted with these additions to the MCC Collection and am sure that they will be enjoyed by visitors to Lords for years to come.
Apart from Jayawardene and Sangakaaras portraits the exhibition will also showcase Middlesexs County Championship wins throughout history that includes their unbeaten run in 1878, the summer of 1947 and their triumph in 2016 that came on the final day against Yorkshire.
Exhibition will include Denis Comptons bat from 1947 with which he scored 3,816 First-Class runs and also Toby Roland-Jones hat-trick ball from last seasons championship win.

School heads instructed to assist O/L students to obtain NICs
Principals have been instructed by the Education Ministry to take steps to get National Identify Cards (NICs) for schoolchildren who sit for the G.C.E. (O.L.). Examination-2017 in December from their schools.
Many students who sat for the G.C.E.(A/L) and G.C.E. (O/L) Exam in the last few years had faced severe difficulties as they could not get their NICs on time.
Some school heads have filled application forms incorrectly. Consequently, students and parents had to undergo severe difficulties at the last moment of the exams, sources said.
All students at the age of 15 can apply for a NIC. The Department of Examinations has called for applications for the O/L exam 2017. The closing date for applications is May 31. School candidates have to submit their applications through their school heads, while private candidates have to submit their applications directly to the Commissioner General of Examinations.
The G.C.E.(O.L.) Examination-2017 will be held from December 12 to 21.

NWP Councillor alleges:
Senior students of leading schools in Kuliyapitiya reportedly had visited ayurveda treatment centres in the Kurunegala urban area seeking massages wasting money given to them by their parents for tuition fees.
NWP Councillor Samanpriya Herath raised the issue at the NWP monthly meeting recently. North Western Province (NWP) Chief Minister Dharmasiri Dassanayake said he would take the issue seriously as students could become accustomed to numerous bad habits by visiting massage clinics.

Sharapova to play Wimbledon qualifiers after opting against wildcard
PARIS May19: Maria Sharapova said Friday she will not request a wildcard for Wimbledon, instead opting to play in qualifying for the Grand Slam she won in 2004, as she returns from a doping ban.
The Russian former world number one was this week refused a wildcard for the French Open following her 15-month ban for taking meldonium.
Because of my improved ranking after the first three tournaments of my return, I will also be playing the qualifying of Wimbledon in Roehampton, and will not be requesting a wildcard into the main draw, said Sharapova on her website. The 30-year-old was controversially handed a wildcard for next month's WTA grasscourt event in Birmingham, a key warm-up for Wimbledon with eight of the world's top 10 set to take part, including world number one Angelique Kerber.
A few months ago I received a wildcard offer from Birmingham, one of my most memorable tournaments as a young player. I am so grateful and excited to be playing this event again! she said. AFP

SLC invests in Podiatry in continued injury prevention & performance enhancement measures
Sri Lanka Cricket announced on Friday the latest in a series of injury prevention & management measures of its national performance squads with the introduction of the services of former Olympic [swim] medallist and elite athlete, Australian Pediatrics Dr. Nicholas Sprenger.
Sprenger is one of the Gold Coasts most respected Podiatrist who practices in all aspects of conservative care of the foot and ankle, as well as post-operative care following orthopaedic surgery of the foot and ankle. As an athlete himself, he has a special interest in Sports Podiatry and has been working with the Queensland Academy of Sports Athletes, the Queensland Rugby League Referees and the Brisbane Lions AFL.
Identifying an unusually high incidence of injuries plaguing the national performance squads (NPS) of Sri Lanka, the Executive Committee of SLC contracted the services of Sprenger, who has spent the past week in Colombo in sessions with the NPS, including the 17 players who departed the island for the Champions Trophy last morning.
In sessions spanning over 30 minutes each, individual players were assessed through passive, active & dynamic testing and casting moulds prepared for each player. Customised Orthotics will be manufactured to suit the requirements of each individual player, who will be delivered this advantage by the end of June this year.
Expressing his views on the successful sessions conducted by Dr. Sprenger SLC Training & Rehabilitation Manager (HP) Nirmalan Thanabalasingam said
The use of podiatry, and in particular a podiatrist of Dr. Sprengers skill will help us provide the players with the best possible orthotics. This is an investment in to the future and will help improve performance, minimise fatigue and reduce the risk of injury
(Nirmalan Thanabalasingam)
As a player who benefited from the services of a Podiatrist back in 1999 when we were provided this opportunity by the then SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala, Im really happy to see this obtained for the national players
said former Sri Lankan new-ball seamer and Consultant Fast Bowling Coach Chaminda Vaas I experienced first-hand the value of corrective orthotics and, I am very happy to see SLC investing once again into these important areas that had been neglected for so long as they will reap immense benefit to the players not only in the short term, but in the long run as well he concluded.
(Chaminda Vaas)
Podiatry is the science of the study, diagnosis, and medical and surgical treatment of disorders of the foot, ankle and lower extremity.
Sport podiatry, a sub-specialty of podiatric medicine, involves the expertise in diagnosis of foot and lower limb problems as well as treatments such as joint mobilisation, advanced biomechanical assessments, soft-tissue manipulation and trigger point therapy, advanced functional orthotic therapy, exercise rehabilitation, exercise prescription [strength and conditioning] of the lower extremities and footwear prescription for the professional, elite, amateur and young athletes. Sports podiatry covers foot and lower limb chronic overuse injuries & mechanical performance enhancement to minimise injury and to maximise efficiency.

Petition challenging Registration of Electors:
A Special Determination petition filed by former Member of Maharagama Urban Council challenging the bill titled Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Bill was yesterday fixed for May 23 by the Supreme Court.
The petitioner Nishantha Wimalachandra is seeking a declaration that bill should become law only through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The petitioner stated that a bill titled Registration of Electors (Special Provisions) Bill was presented to Parliament and placed on the Order Paper of Parliament on May 3, 2017.

Special Kane not for sale, vows Pochettino
Leicester:Mauricio Pochettino insists there is no chance Harry Kane will be allowed to leave Tottenham after his "special" striker's four-goal blitz in the 6-1 rout of Leicester.
Kane is odds on to finish as the Premier League's top scorer for the second successive season thanks to his lethal display at the King Power Stadium on Thursday.
The England international now has 26 goals, putting him two ahead of Everton's Romelu Lukaku with one game remaining in the race for the golden boot.
It was the kind of predatory performance that Pochettino believes further enhances Kane's reputation as one of the world's best finishers.
Inevitably, Europe's top clubs will be considering mega-money bids for Kane in the close season, but Pochettino has no intention of selling his prize asset at any cost.
"It is very clear we will keep the players we want to keep," Pochettino said.
"We are so calm about our key players. They are happy here, we have an exciting project."
Kane's fifth Premier League hat-trick in just over two years took him to 32 goals in all competitions this season, four more than he managed last term and one more than the 31 he bagged in the 2014-15 season.
The 23-year-old would surely have scored more than 40 if he hadn't missed two chunks of this season with ankle injuries, and Pochettino spoke glowing about Kane's appetite for success.
"We feel so proud of Harry, to score four goals was fantastic," Pochettino said.
"He was injured twice this season but he is so fresh now and he is trying to score a lot of goals to finish at the top.
"Harry's a special player, he loves Tottenham. He means a lot for the team.
"I tell you always that he's one of the best strikers in the world. His performances show that we are right."
Kane can wrap up the golden boot by getting on the scoresheet again in Tottenham's final game at Hull on Sunday and he is already hungry for more after his first professional four-goal haul.
"There has been a bit of build-up on the race for the golden boot and I wanted at least one or two to put the pressure on but to get four is amazing," Kane said.
"I'm now sitting at the top, but we go in with the same mentality, to make sure we win first and foremost and then score as many as I can."
Second placed Tottenham's total of 83 points is a tally that would have been enough to win the title on eight previous occasions.But unfortunately for the north Londoners, who have won 11 of their last 12 league games, champions Chelsea have been even more consistent.
After collapsing in the final furlong last season, Tottenham have largely handled the pressures of the title race better this time.
And Pochettino hopes the experience will stand them in good stead next term, when they have to play their home games at Wembley while White Hart Lane is rebuilt.
"We were talking about last season when we finished so bad. We spoke a lot about changing that feeling and finishing in the best way," he said.
"We wanted to improve this season and this type of performance showed we have learned a lot.
"It's always important to finish in a better mood, especially when we move to Wembley next season."
Leicester manager Craig Shakespeare faces talks with the club's Thai owners next week to decide if he will remain in charge and this thrashing was hardly the ideal way to sell his credentials.
"We've come up against a quality side but the disappointing thing is I didn't see enough desire to defend as a team," he said.
"I have to take some responsibility for that after changing the formation. if you get beat 6-1, there's no positives."AFP

Threatening SLMC a futile move: Prof. Carlo
SAITM's legality is questionable:
No one will be able to fulfill their objectives by threatening the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The SLMC is not scared of anything or anyone and accepts the religion of justice, SLMC President Prof. Carlo Fonseka said.
Addressing the media at the SLMC Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said nothing can be get done by the SLMC by making its members scared. The recent bomb attack attempt is the seventh such incident on the SLMC since 2002. The SLMC ensures the safety of patients by ensuring the quality of medical education and keeping the discipline of doctors, he said.
According to Prof. Fonseka, the Western medical practice came to Sri Lanka in 1870. The SLMC was established in 1925. Various attacks on the SLMC commenced in the 21st century.
The SLMC is the highest authority which can access and decide technical matters in connection with higher education in medicine. The SLMC sent a team of 10 experts to SAITM in 2015 and compiled a report on it. SAITM's legality is questionable, he said.
Former Vice Chancellor of the University of Sri Jayawardenepura Prof. Narada Warnasuriya said SAITM did not follow rules and regulations to obtain the degree awarding status. The degree awarding status was offered to SAITM through `other' ways. The Kothalawa Defence Academy Medical Collage followed the proper procedure, Prof. Fonseka said.

An unauthorised construction: Patali
Collapsed Wellawatte building:
Nearly 10,000 illgal constructions in Colombo District:
Vows legal action against owner :
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka yesterday said that the Wellawatte building that collapsed on Thursday morning, was an unauthorised construction.
He vowed stern legal action against the perpetrators. He said that the primary survey conducted by the State Engineering Corporation revealed that the building collapsed due to structural failure.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Ministry,he pointed out that building on strips of lands immediately adjacent to canals was illegal.
Minister Ranawaka said that the owner had got approval for a housing plan in 2009 but had not obtained the compliance certificate for the building.
Later, he had turned it into a reception hall and extended the building area encroaching the canal bank.
The portion that collapsed was built adjacent to the originally approved building and that was being constructed in the canal reservation area,Minister Ranawaka said.
Minister Ranawaka said that he informed the Inspector General of Police to take legal action against the owner under the Penal Code.
The Minister said the number of unauthorised buildings are on the rise and added that they face many issues when taking legal action against the owners.
On February 1, the Ministry began a survey in thw Wellawatte and Banlmbalapitiya areas. It was revealed that there are around 1,800 unauthorised settlements and buildings between Bambalapitiya and Wellawatte, the Minister said.
He noted that legal action will be taken against the offenders.
Minister Ranawaka further said that they have not completed the survey and expect to complete it with the support of Department of Census and Statistics.
The rough estimation shows that there are around 10,000 illegal substandard constructions in the Colombo, Dehiwala, Mount Lavinia and Kolannawa areas. There is a huge problem with regard to the quality assurance in constructions, Minister Ranawaka said.
He said buildings constructed on either side of the canals would be subjected to inspection by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry.

Venezuela: Revolution and Counter-revolution
Venezuela is in the news again. International news agencies who control the content, form and volume of news transmissions have been orchestrating a continuous flood of stories about anti-government protests and violent reactions to them by government supporters. Much of these stories or almost hundred percent of them are far from accurate or objective. There is a conspiracy of silence about terrorist actions by the far right activists and often perpetrators of such actions are portrayed as heroes.
This is nothing new as the business elites as well as other well-to-do sections of the Venezuelan society are continually engaged in a struggle to reverse the gains of the masses following the peaceful and constitutional revolution headed by president Huge Chavez. One could recall the failed coup dtat of April 11, 2002 in which President Chavez was arrested, the National Assembly and the Supreme Court was dissolved by Pedro Carmona, President of the Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce (Fedcamares) who was installed as the interim President.
It was evident that the United States supported the coup as it immediately recognized the new Government. It later became evident that leaders of the coup had continuous links with President George Bush who met them even few days prior to the coup.
What is unfolding today in Venezuela is almost a repetition of the same drama. The United States is funding the Opposition and is involved openly in subversive activities in Venezuela. Once again it is the Conservatives, private media and the well-to-do that are leading the street protests.
There have been many acts of terrorism and vandalism by the protestors and they have not been reported in the international media, including in Sri Lanka. From April 4th this year up to now, over 40 persons have been killed during the protests. Except in two or so incidents in which the deaths were attributed to shooting by state armed forces or police the rest were perpetrated by anti-government rioters or they have not been identified yet. Armed Forces personnel were provocatively shot at by protestors in several incidents.
The worst act of terrorism was a night attack on a public Maternity Hospital which led to the evacuation of over 50 babies and mothers, despite eye witness reports confirming it. Ironically, not a word about the incident was carried in the international media.
The Organisation of American States has been conducting a hostile policy towards Venezuela at the instigation of the United States. Its Secretary General Luis Almegro has been openly interfering and threatening to expel Venezuela from the OAS. However, an attempt to do so with the help of rightwing governments in the region failed. Now Venezuela has withdrawn from it, denying the Opposition a chance to claim a victory if the OAS expelled the country from membership. However, it would take two years for the withdrawal process to be complete.
Washington has been calling for a regional response to the Venezuelan crisis and is also manipulating the election process in Venezuela. On the other hand, President Maduro has been calling for a solution to the crisis through dialogue. The Right Wing Opposition Coalition MUD, led by former Presidential candidate and Governor of Miranda Henrique Capriles has rejected dialogue and called for the overthrow of the government.
His Holiness Pope Francis playing a mediation role has also called for a dialogue. He is supported by Martin Torrijos, Leonel Fernandez and Jose Luis Rodriguez former Presidents of Panama, Dominican Republic and Spain respectively. Governments of Argentine, Brazil, Chile, Columbia, Costa Rico, Peru Paraguay and Uruguay are also involved in mediation attempts.
On May Day President Maduro announced that he would call a Constituent Assembly comprising 500 members, half of whom will be elected by direct secret vote in Parliament and the other half would constitute selected representatives of special groups (not political parties) such as the disabled, students, and farmer organisations etc. in accordance with Article 347 of the Venezuelan Constitution.
The Opposition is divided on this issue with far right radicals opposing the move as a coup and the moderates supporting it as a way out of the crisis.
It is clear the crisis is a reflection of the aggravation of the contradiction in Venezuelan society exacerbated by economic difficulties following the drop in oil prices and aided by far from prudent management of the economy by the Government and deliberate sabotage actions of the Opposition.
An important element of this aggravation is the external pressure exerted by the United States and imperialist powers, who believe that destabilization and overthrow of the Venezuelan government would have a domino effect in Latin America which would also end the revolutionary government in Cuba.
Israel downgrades Arab citizens
New legislation before Israeli Parliament seeks to downgrade its Arab citizens to second or third grade, as it empowers the Jewish citizens with special privileges. The bill passed its preliminary reading with 48 MPs voting for and 41 against. It says that Israel is the national home of the Jewish people and downgrades the status of the Arab language from being an official language (alongside Hebrew) to that of being a language with special status. There are 20 percent Arabs in Israel. They total to 1.5 million.
This would not only undermine the principle of equality of citizens that is acclaimed the world over but also lower their already inferior socio-economic status and widen the gulf between the Arab and Jewish populations.
Unless this attempt is thwarted by international pressure the passage of this law through Parliament would create a dangerous precedent that fascist or chauvinist or ultra-nationalist forces could emulate. Likewise it could escalate social and political confrontation in countries with substantial emigrant populations at a time when emigration is increasing on a world scale due to globalization.

What you need to know about this historic rivalry
The Bradby Shield - Trinity vs Royal:
Everyone is aware that Trinity- Royal rugby encounter had its beginning in 1920; it was on the 31st of July 1920 at 5.15pm at Thurstan Road, the present University grounds, where Trinity beat Royal 26-0. This match was scheduled to be played in Kandy, due to some epidemic reasons in Kandy the fixture was to be stopped. However, the Trinitians readily agreed to travel down to Colombo. But they had to keep some of their stalwarts behind as there was the key Stubs Shield Boxing Meet on the same day.
Trinity College took to rugby way back in 1906 under Rev. A.G. Fraser. At that time no other schools played rugby up to 1920. During this period, Trinity had to be satisfied with matches with scratch Ceylonese teams with masters, the Englishmen also helping the school. Royal took to rugby in 1920 with the arrival of Principal H.L. Reed, with only a few months of training, the Royalists challenged the experienced Trinitians. Royal took the field with only a few months practices. Even though it was not the first school match to be played, it was only one match played every year. So, it became an annual event until Royal gave up the game in 1926 and once again resumed in 1928 to continue their annual battles despite losing continuously, but the Royalist continued the game. Then came the end of an era when Royal recorded their first win in 1941 under the captaincy of N.N.Jilla, Royal 11  Trinity 3.  Referee J.C.A. Prins. Then in 1942 Trinity won, in 1943 Royal won both games, that is the year for the first time two games were played to make up for the pull out of Zahira College and St. Peter's College who had to give up during war. At that time only four schools were involved.
Trinity, Royal, Zahira and St. Peter's. With St.Peters and Zahira pulling out, the game was fading away., So to prevent the interest from dropping in the game, the principal of Royal College E.L. Bradby, came forward to present the shield in 1945 for the competition between Trinity and Royal, with two matches be played one in Kandy and the other in Colombo.The team which gets the highest aggregate of points in both matches is awarded the Shield. So, E.L.Bradby put forward the idea of playing an annual two-match series, to which the principal of Trinity College, C. E. Simithraaratchy too readily agreed with it.
Every year, this scrum down produces rugby of a very high quality with standard above expectations, where thousands of rugby lovers come a long way from all over the country, friends, fans, well-wishers and old boys who live in different parts of the world make doubly certain that they visit their loved ones back home during the Bradby while some others travel all the way mainly to be part of the game. Bradby at its infancy drew only a few hundred spectators. The game was not that popular. At one time, the popular event in our country was horse racing, which was the most popular sport until the mid-1950s and at that time not many schools took to rugby, the late Prime Minister a product of S. Thomas College late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike is the man who banned horse racing in 1956 and that helped rugby to attract new enthusiasts. It was only after 1957 that most of the schools took to the game of rugby.
The series has been played annually and uninterrupted ever since. The Shield designed and made by Kandyan silversmiths and was donated by E.L. Bradby on his departure from Ceylon in 1945. It is a wooden disk decorated with intricate traditional Kandyan silver works. On winning the series, the shield is presented to the winning team's captain at an award ceremony held on the playing field immediately following the end of final whistle in the second leg.
The winning team is then privileged to hand the shield over to their respective school, where it is kept on display until next year, where it will again be up for grabs. The first Bradby game was in 1945 when Royal led by C.D.L. Fernando beat Trinity led by Robert Sourjah 3-0 in the first leg in Colombo. However in the game played in Kandy the Trinitians managed to win 6-0 and clinch the shield in the inaugural year on the basis of aggregate, in the second leg Trinity were led by S.B.Pilapitiya. So at the school assembly the Royal principal had asked the captain C.D.L. Fernando, what happened to the match, won the first leg and lost the second, the reply had been "Sir, they played better than us" The two captain of this inaugural Bradby, C.D.L Fernando and R.G. Sourjah, strangely, both went on to become doctors by profession dispelling belief that sport was a hindrance to studies.
The golden years of rugby at Trinity College were the 1950's when the Bradby was won in six consecutive years. During these years, except for one tie in 1955, all the Royal matches were won from 1952 to 1957. The period also coincides with that master builder Principal Norman Walter's tenure of office.
How he enlisted all the masters in College who could take practice is a wonder and no payments were made to any. As for boys, it was compulsory for all of them to be at rugger if not face the consequences the following day.
This happened to some and they received four cuts and thank very much for that warming up, which made the rugby players.
Such are the memories not only for rugby seasons, but lasting bonds of friendship made between the two schools. The friendships last to date and beyond boundaries.
