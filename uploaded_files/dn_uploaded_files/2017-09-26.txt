Masters of magic
One of the biggest mysteries in life is how they create these illusions How do they do it How do they do the incredible things they do Do they manipulate our minds Does magic run in their blood like Harry Potter How different are they from you and I How have they mastered the art of illusion They do amazing stuff and no one has any idea as to how they do it
Knight of Illusions, a professional magic show was held last Saturday at the Bishops College Auditorium. The show featured award winning magicians such as Xavier Mortimer, Michael Finney, the duo Neill Croswell and Ashley Da Silva and Hannibal the magic warrior.
These are some of the greatest magicians in the business and their magic repertoire is absolutely amazing. Ayati Trust is building the National Center for kids with disability and this show will raise awareness for the charity and would aim at donating its profits towards the project.
Magic has always appealed to the minds of human beings unless you are a person who is of the cynical or skeptical nature. J.K. Rowlings Harry Potter has taken the world by storm. The books and the films are highly popular. Adults like children wish they could go to Hogwarts and learn magic! But is magic real
Well transfiguration may not be possible like the way Professor McGonagall changed a wine glass into a rat! But magic is quite real. How else could doves and rabbits suddenly appear from nowhere Magic is a business and maybe one day we could have a magic academy in Sri Lanka Just like Hogwarts! How exciting would that be!
Knight of Illusions was a brand created way back in 2001 to promote Magic and Illusions in Sri Lanka. This time magic was taken to a different and more exciting level.
Knight of Illusions will give a new taste of magic to Sri Lankans with classical and modern acts, which will hope to create a desire to see more and more magic.
The prospect of learning magic is encouraging. Unlike Harry Potter magic need not be in your blood! You can learn magic. For example Yasas Gunaratne is a self-magician!
I always wanted to do things differently and Magic has been a passion for me. My dream was to change the poor perception of magic in Sri Lanka and to take Sri Lankan magic to the International arena, said , said Magician Yasas Gunaratne
Xavier has massive talent and has enjoyed huge success in Las Vegas. He is the next generation magician. He was a natural choice. So he has agreed to perform with us. Michael Finney is more of a guru to me. I grew up watching him. He has a lot of experience. He is extremely versatile. It is a real honor for me to sit next to him.
"Then we have the young and dynamic couple  Neil Croswell and Ashely Da Silva. I am sure Sri Lankans will really enjoy their performance. They are all the way from Toronto Canada. They two are highly skilled and famous. They are young, creative and innovative. Finally I must speak about my colleague Hannibal, who is a serious comedian. He has been very supportive to me, explained Gunaratne.
The show is important to these magicians for many reasons. It will really contribute to the progress of Sri Lankan magic at a local level and at an international level. Doing shows like this helps magic itself. It enables people to enjoy magic and believe in magic. And as mentioned before it is going to charity. This is the power of magic. To transform lives. These shows will make Sri Lanka, a magic destination. All these magicians are performing free. Their hearts are as big as their talent. So they are dedicating their precious time to come down here and entertain us. Some day we can look back at what we have accomplished and we can be proud. If we can achieve the next generation of magic that will be really great for both the industry and for those we touch through our magic, stated Gunaratne.
The imagination is there. The passion is there. The interest is there. The brains are here. Somewhere down the line like I said before magic could become a discipline taught in universities. One thing history has taught us is that man can attain what he imagines or conceives. If can imagine placing a colony on the moon then why cant we have a magic school

Matthews rues wasted energy as Sagan wins
Bergen: Australia's Michael Matthews was left ruing a tactical blunder as he had to settle for bronze at the world road race championships won for the third year in a row by Peter Sagan.
Matthews was unable to challenge Sagan and silver-medallist Alexander Kristoff in the sprint finish to the 267.5km race in Bergen on Sunday and afterwards admitted he'd made a mistake on the final of 12 laps around the street circuit.
There was a climb around 15km from the finish where Frenchman Julian Alaphilippe and Gianni Moscon of Italy escaped but both were caught before the finish.
Matthews had also tried to attack on that climb and he said he later paid for those efforts.
"What I would change (is) I wouldn't attack so many times on the final climb," said the 26-year-old, know as 'Bling' for his flashy lifestyle.
"I didn't know it would come down to such a huge bunch sprint. I think I wasted a lot of energy.
"I was trying to go with moves and attacking myself; if I could take something back I think I would sit back with these guys (Sagan and Kristoff) and crusie up the climb."
When it came to the sprint finale, Kristoff launched his first but Sagan was ideally placed on his wheel and just had enough strength and speed to inch past the Norwegian and snatch victory in a photo finish.
"Unfortunately I was just not fast enough to keep him behind me," said Kristoff.
"It was close, I did my maximum, I must be happy with the result but for sure I'm disappointed.
"When you see who won it's not easy to beat him, he won a lot of big races and races typically like this.
"I don't really know how I could have done anything more -- I did a good sprint, I was not going slower at the end.
"Maybe he was just a little fresher and faster at the end."
Sagan's victory in some way helped make up for the disappointment of being kicked off July's Tour de France after elbowing sprint rival Mark Cavendish during a hectic finish to stage four. AFP

Modern day music has wonderful fusions
Cher loves the modern day mix of pop, rap and country in music.
The 71-year-old rose to fame as one half of pop duo Sonny and Cher, alongside her then-husband Sonny Bono, with the pair releasing hit tracks like I Got You Babe and even starring in their own TV show.
Cher has reinvented her sound numerous times over the years, and has so far brought out 25 studio albums, though she admits she can see major differences in todays music stars compared to when she started out in the 60s.Young stars seem to be a lot more polished than they used to be, she said to British Vogue. But there are a lot more sounds available these days to work with, and wonderful fusions between pop, rap and country.
As well as a music career, Cher has also enjoyed success as an actress, and even won an Oscar for her role in 1988 romantic comedy Moonstruck.
She was also nominated for her role in Silkwood, though looking back, Cher can see how some of her appearances at the Academy Awards were overshadowed by her wardrobe choices.
I knew some people in the Academy didnt think that I was a serious actress. I always felt a bit sad that I presented Don Ameche with his Best Supporting Actor award (for Cocoon) in that outfit. It seemed to make him a little nervous, she said of the infamous beaded Bob Mackie two-piece with dramatic plumed headdress that she wore to the 1986 Oscars. Music News

Moodys downgrades UK credit rating
The UKs credit rating has been cut over concerns about the UKs public finances and fears Brexit could damage the countrys economic growth.
Moodys, one of the major ratings agencies, downgraded the UK to an Aa2 rating from Aa1.
It said leaving the European Union was creating economic uncertainty at a time when the UKs debt reduction plans were already off course.
Downing Street said the firms Brexit assessments were outdated.
The other major agencies, Fitch and S&P, changed their ratings in 2016, with S&P cutting it two notches from AAA to AA, and Fitch lowering it from AA+ to AA.
Moodys said the government had yielded to pressure and raised spending in several areas including health and social care.
It says revenues were unlikely to compensate for the higher spending.The agency said because the government had not secured a majority in the snap election it further obscures the future direction of economic policy.
It also said Brexit would dominate legislative priorities, so there could be limited capacity to address substantial challenges. It added any free trade agreement will likely take years to negotiate, prolonging the current uncertainty for business.
Moodys has also changed the UKs long-term issuer and debt ratings to stable from negative.
Moodys stripped Britain of its top-notch AAA rating in 2013.
The government said the latest downgrade followed a meeting on September 19 and did not consider the prime ministers speech last Friday, in which she outlined her vision for Brexit.
The prime minister has just set out an ambitious vision for the UKs future relationship with the EU, making clear that both sides will benefit from a new and unique partnership, it said.
The foundations on which we build this partnership are strong.
It said it had a robust economic record and had made substantial progress in reducing the deficit.
We are not complacent about the challenges ahead, but we are optimistic about our bright future. (BBC)

"But my favourite song on the album, the last song, 'From the Dining Table,' is the most personal to me and I think my favourite one.

Need to include informal sector to boost  SLs tourism - PM
Sri Lanka needs to take more care of the informal tourism sector including small-time accommodation owners as well those in the non-accommodation sectors, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He was speaking at the Annual General Meeting of the Ceylon Hotel School Graduates Association which was held in Tangalle last week.
Some countries have a separate focus on the informal accommodation sector. We will be talking to small-time stakeholders in the tourist industry in a bid to identify their problems and help them and get them all of them registered, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said that to meet this objective the government would soon introduce a new tourism law where more powers would be given out.
He also said that today tourism trends and travel partners have changed and Sri Lanka too should look at marketing from a new angle. Today huge airlines that existed two decades ago have disappeared and budget airlines have emerged. Similarly travel agents too are a dying breed and online bookings are playing a major role in bringing in travelers.
I have also asked the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau to give the government a new restructuring plan in this regard.
The Prime Minister said that tourism is a huge foreign exchange earner and the revenue generated from it could be used to repay some of the national debt.
We need money to meet debts and for recurrent expenditures. Today, our revenue exceeds debt services. Tourism too can help the government to pay off all existing debts.
He said the government is looking at a 5 million arrival target for 2020 and this is achievable. We expect the bulk of these travelers to be from Asia.
Premier Wickremesinghe said plans are also afoot to make Sri Lanka a year around destination rather than not depending on just one season. He said that major changes are being planned to entertain the influx of tourists to Sri Lanka. We are looking at new destinations for golf and other entertainment in Kandy, Galle and Iranawilla. (SS)

New Zealand flights return to normal after pipeline repairs
Airlines will start receiving the first batch of jet fuel through the main pipeline to Auckland Airport since it was damaged earlier this month.
Two million litres will be transferred on Monday evening local time, ending a 10-day shortage.
Most flights have returned to normal after a week of disruptions due to the burst pipe.
Fuel supplies had been rationed but daily allocations will be lifted from 50% to 80% from midnight.
About 140 flights were cancelled at New Zealand's largest airport and the plans of thousands of travellers disrupted last week after the pipeline was ruptured by a digger on a rural property. Several petrol stations in Auckland were also hit by fuel shortages because of the burst pipe.
The disruptions have eased following repairs to the pipe, and only four flights were cancelled on Monday.
Fuel industry spokesperson Andrew McNaught, who is also the manager of Mobil Oil New Zealand, told the BBC another batch of 4.8m litres of jet fuel is expected to be delivered on Wednesday.
But supplies flowing through to the airport will be reduced for some time. Pipeline operator Refining NZ said the pipe will run at 80% capacity until the end of the year to allow further tests to be carried out. (BBC)

No one should sabotage the Central Express way project: Malwatte Anunayake
Nobody should attempt to sabotage the Central Express way project, said Anunayake of the Malwatte Chapter Dimbulkumbure Sri Saranankara Wimaladhamma Thera.
Wimaladhamma Thera stressed the necessity of constructing a Central express way for the development of the central province.
Several industries are scheduled to be established in the city and the Central Express way would be very helpful for the functioning of these industries, said the Thera.
He said the historical Kandy city is the second largest city of Sri Lanka and it takes around four and half hours to reach Kandy.
This is a massive waste of time. Therefore, it is very essential to have an express way from Colombo to Kandy. Measures should be taken to complete construction of Central Express way as soon as possible.
Significant places of worship such as the Temple of the Tooth Relics, Malwatte Temple, Asgiriya Temple, Peradeniya Botanical Garden and the University of Peradeniya are situated in this historical city.
Hence, nobody should attempt to sabotage this express way project. It is our right, he said.
Wimaladhamma Thera further said the present government must do its best for the betterment of the country within the five year duration of its term of office, if not they would not be able to come in to power again and nobody should oppose the good things they do.

No provisions in bill to ensure 30% female representation: CaFFE
Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) issuing a press release states that the government has deceived womens rights organisations, civil society organisations and all interested parties by indicating that the recently passed Amendments to the Provincial Council Election laws ensure higher female representation at Provincial Councils.
The stated objective of the amendment is to ensure that 30 percent of the list of candidates of a political party consist of women. However, there are no provisions in the bill to make any list of candidates invalid, of it does not consist of 30 percent of women. Thus, the selection officer has no power to reject such a list. It is unfortunate that womens rights organisations and civil society organisations, who are silent on the undemocratic nature in which this bill was passed last week, have not hitherto realised that the bill does not ensure higher female representation in Provincial Councils.
The other slogan used by those who supported the bill is that this bill will ensure that the elections for all nine provinces will be held on one day. Once again there are no provisions on this bill to ensure that. Not only that, a close reading of the bill shows that the elections will have to be held on a staggered basis (at least in two separate occasions).
The bill has also ensured that the parliament will have to debate and come up with provisions to resolve over a dozen technical issues and confusions that have arisen. The government will surely bring in new proposals to rectify issues that arise from issues such as appointing a new delimitation commission outside the existing one. Given what transpired regarding the amendments to the laws governing Local Government elections, it is difficult to estimate how long it will take for parliament to resolve these issues. This can easily lead to a delay in holding elections,

No tenders called for Expressway projects under MR govt.- Kiriella
Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said the previous Government spent Rs.6.9 billion per a kilometer on the Outer Circular Highway (Stage 3) while the construction cost of a kilometre of the Central Expressway is Rs.3.9 billion, under the present government.
He further said that the contracts for the construction of highways were offered to contractors without calling for Tenders by the previous government, namely the Southern Expressway and the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway.
During a meeting with a group of officials from the Road Development Authority, Kiriella said some people were attempting to sabotage the work of the Central Expressway by citing the cost, although the construction cost has been reduced by Rs. 3 billion per a kilometre.
The estimates also had been changed at the end of the highway constructions. For example; the Dodangoda Expressway from Rs.9.6 billion to Rs.21.4 billion, the Dodangoda to Kurudugahahatakma Expressway from Rs.8.3 billion to Rs.26.3 billion and the Kurudugahahatakma to Pinnaduwa Expressway from Rs.8.7 billion to Rs.35 billion, Minister Kiriella said. Kiriella also said that his ministry was ready to answer queries raised by the Auditor General and not other people who have no knowledge on counting construction costs or skills. He also told the RDA officials, the government has decided to award the contract for the third stage of the Central Expressway to the Taisei Corporation and the agreement will be inked next week.
He assured that the Tender procedures were carried out in a very transparent manner while maintaining the highest standards in all matters pertaining to the Central Expressway which will be funded by the Government of Japan.
The Minister said that although the present government called for Tenders to offer the highway projects, the Mahinda Rajapaksa government never called for Tenders for projects such as the Southern Highway Project. Instead they decided on the company and obtained Cabinet approval for that particular company he said. Minister Kiriella said all decisions on the Central Highway project were taken according to the decisions taken by the Cabinet chaired by President Maithripala sirisena and the Economic Council chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

North Korea accuses US of declaring war

North Korea's Foreign Minister has accused US President Donald Trump of declaring war on his country and said Pyongyang had the right to shoot down US bombers. 
Ri Yong-ho said this could apply even if the warplanes were not in North Korea's airspace. The White House dismissed the statement as "absurd". The Pentagon warned Pyongyang to stop provocations. 
A UN spokesman said fiery talk could lead to fatal misunderstandings. Ri's comments were a response to Trump's tweetthat the North Korean leadership would not "be around much longer" if they continued their rhetoric. 
The whole world should clearly remember it was the US who first declared war on our country," Ri told reporters as he was leaving New York, where he had addressed the UN General Assembly on Saturday. 
Since the United States declared war on our country, we will have every right to make counter-measures, including the right to shoot down United States strategic bombers even when they are not inside the airspace border of our country." 
Trump's tweet followed Ri's fiery speech to the UN on Saturday, when he described the US president as a "mentally deranged person full of megalomania" on a "suicide mission". Referring to Trump's post, North Korea's Minister said "the question of who won't be around much longer" would be answered by his country. 
Ri's remarks - not the first time that North Korea has used the phrase "a declaration of war" in relation to the US - are the latest in an increasingly angry war of words between the two countries. His statement came two days after US warplanes flew close to North Korea's coast in a show of force. 
Pentagon spokesman Col Robert Manning reacted by saying: "If North Korea does not stop their provocative actions, you know, we will make sure that we provide options to the president to deal with North Korea." 
"Stphane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, said: "Fiery talk can lead to fatal misunderstandings." 
"The only solution for this is a political solution," he added. 
Despite weeks of tension, experts have played down the risk of direct conflict between the two. North Korea has continued to carry out nuclear and ballistic missile tests in recent weeks, in defiance of successive rounds of UN sanctions. 
The country's leaders say nuclear capabilities are its only deterrent against an outside world seeking to destroy it. After the North's latest and most powerful nuclear test earlier this month, the UN Security Council approved new sanctions on the country. 
The rhetoric on both sides may have got out of hand already but the real question is what practical consequences might ensue from the war of words between Washington and Pyongyang 
It should be remembered that the Korean peninsula is not at peace - the Korean conflict of the 1950s was only brought to a halt by an armistice, not a peace treaty. 
But it is actions that are likely to provoke renewed fighting, not just words. 
The latest North Korean threat to shoot down US warplanes comes in the wake of a recent US patrol that took its B1-B Lancer bombers and their accompanying F-15 fighter escorts over waters to the east of North Korea - the furthest north US warplanes have flown for several months, albeit still outside Pyongyang's airspace. 
The US believes it has every right to do this but if one day Pyongyang judges that these aircraft are on an offensive mission - what then

Oil distribution through trains more profitable: Ranatunga
More attention will be paid to use trains to distribute oil island-wide, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
He said the distribution of oil by trains will be cheaper than distribution through fuel trucks. Steps will be taken to extend provincial fuel storage terminals.
The minister added that plans are afoot to extend Kandy- Peradeniya fuel storage terminal as the first step.
The minister said so during his inspection tour to the Central Province branch of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in Peradeniya.
During his visit, the minister discussed issues faced by workers and he said steps are taken to remove unnecessary expenses of the CPC.
It will be more profitable to transport oil by trains to Kandy. I took over this institution to get profits for the CPC. On the other hand, it is difficult for the CPC to make profits because it is providing more relief to consumers. First, we should try to reduce the loss. We already reduced the expenditure of the CPC in a way it does not affect the privileges of workers, the minister said.
Even when I was functioning as the Port and Shipping Minister, I lived by this principle. We understood that unnecessary expenses were due to superiors behaviour, not the workers, he said. Workers should be responsible and dedicate to this institution, the minister added

Pimp My TukTuk Charity Ride benefits charities
The 2017 Pimp My TukTuk Charity Ride which combines tourism with charity ended in Colombo last Friday with 54 riders in 27 tuktuks travelling the length and breadth of Sri Lanka within eight days.
Organised by the Pimp My TukTuk Team, Singapore, in partnership with the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, funds raised by this endeavour will be donated to selected charitable and developmental projects under the stewardship of the Foundation of Goodness in Sri Lanka, as well as to Food from the Heart, Singapore, Kushil Gunasekera, Founderhief Trustee of Foundation of Goodness told the media during a press briefing in Colombo on Friday.
According to Gunasekera, the official tour commenced from Colombo and travelled across the country from Sigiriya and Mihintale to Trincomalee, before travelling down the east coast to Batticaloa and Arugam Bay, heading inwards across Monaragala before returning to the southern coast and proceeding via Unawatuna to Colombo (with a special stop at the Foundation of Goodness MCC Centre of Excellence in Seenigama, Galle).
Along the way, the riders stopped at five destinations to work with the local communities, conducting humanitarian and community development activities including visiting the three Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Plants (R. O. Plants) built by the group in 2015, 2016 and 2017 as well as stopping by the Methsewa Special Needs Home in Monaragala and the Foundation of Goodness (FoG) Eravur Village Heartbeat Empowerment Centre in Batticaloa and the FoG MCC Centre of Excellence and Sports Academy in Seenigama.
The 2017 ride follows on from the great success of the 2015 charity ride where 20 tuktuks and 40 drivers travelled from the North to the South of Sri Lanka, conducting charity projects and falling in love with the country along the way, resulting in their decision to return in 2017 with an even bigger group.
The Foundation of Goodness (FoG) was established in 1999 to bridge the gap between the rural and urban populations. Operating principally out of Seenigama, the devastation caused by the 2004 Tsunami was a great challenge to overcome, which was seen as a chance to turn a setback in to a blessing by rebuilding the village even better. Establishing the MCC Centre of Excellence and adding a Sports Complex, Diving and Training Centre and 8 outlying Village Heartbeat Projects in the South, East and North, the Foundation grew to deliver humanitarian services to over 35,000 beneficiaries from over 200 villages annually, free of cost, via its 30 productive empowerment sectors.
When the years of conflict came to an end, the Foundation of Goodness extended its development activities to the post-war North and East of Sri Lanka and have been working in the North since January 2011, with uninterrupted monthly visits to introduce, maintain and expand a variety of sports, livelihood and welfare programmes, educational initiatives, and village infrastructure development programmes reaching 35,000 beneficiaries to date, rebuilding their lives speedily.

The Badulla, Hali-ela and Elle integrated water supply project will be vested with the people by President Maithripala Sirisena tomorrow at the invitation of City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem and City Planning State Minister Dr. Sudarshini Fernandopulle.
The water project will cover 42 Grama Niladhari Divisions in the Badulla Hali-ela and Elle Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
The project will provide safe drinking water round the clock for more than 100,000 people in Badulla Hali-ela and Elle.
The project consists of a water purification plant which can purify 15,000 cubic metres of water per day, a concrete dam with a tank of 17 metres high which can store 132,000 cubic metres of water, eight water storage tanks, pumping houses, transmission and distribution centres. The government has spent Rs. 11,800 million for the project with the assistance of the United States.
The water collected will be pumped to the water purification plant near the reservoir, which can purify 15,000 cubic metres of water per day. Purification will be carried out under a mixed Tube Settlers and Absorption Clarifiers method and removal of poisonous material methods.
The project also consists of a waste water recycling network to recycle the water ejected through the water purification process. The packaged water treatment centre constructed on a mountain slope of Badulla has also saved a large extent of land area required for a project of this nature in traditional land areas.
The 56 kilometre transmission pipeline network has been constructed with Poly-Ethylene (HDPE) pipes.

Producers of American Made sue over fatal plane crash
Just a couple weeks before their new Tom Cruise film comes out in domestic theaters, the producers behind American Made have filed a lawsuit in Georgia federal court over a plane crash during production that killed two individuals.
Cross Creek Pictures, Imagine Entertainment, Quadrant Pictures and Vendian Entertainment are suing S&S Aviation for what happened on Sept. 11, 2015, when, during the making of the film about the C.I.A.-recruited drug runner Barry Seal, a Piper/Smith Aerostar 600 plane crashed in Colombia. Alan Purwin, a helicopter stunt operator, was killed, as was Carlos Berl, an airman. Jimmy Lee Garland, a partner at S&S, was also in the plane and was left without feeling across much of his lower body.
The crash has developed into one huge legal situation, with the estates of Purwin and Garland suing each other and producers while an insurance company has filed its own claims in a separate lawsuit. All the parties are pinning blame or disclaiming responsibility for what happened. The fatal episode has raised serious questions about safety in Hollywood filmmaking. The Hollywood Reporter

Proposed new Constitution: Interim Report of Steering Committee Negated JO's Propaganda
The Interim Report of the Steering Committee which was presented to Parliament has defeated many of the false propaganda spread by the Joint Opposition (JO), National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Mano Ganesan said. He said the report had disproved claims that Buddhism would lose its prominence,
that a Federal government would be created and that the North and East would be merged.
The new Constitution is not Federal, the place granted to Buddhism has been secured and the North and East will not be merged.
Such matters have been clearly explained in the Interim Report and the JO will now have to weave new lies in future, said the minister. The Minister was speaking at a function at Pushpadana hall in Kandy on Sunday (24). He said that the JO which engaged in politics through the spread of racism and religious conflict will now have to find a new topic to harp on.
Ganesan further said that though the majority of lawyers in the country were law abiding and act in the best interest of the country, there were among them certain corrupt individuals, like in any other profession.
Thus, he said, it was up to the lawyers to identify the corrupt and those who protect the corrupt and remove them from the legal profession.

Raja Hewabowala  elected new CNCI Chairman
The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) had its 56th Annual General Meeting (AGM) on September 18 at Ramada Hotel, Colombo.
The Chief Guest was Chinthaka S Lokuhetti, Secretary, Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Raja Hewabowala who was holding office of the Deputy Chairman was elected Chairman, CNCI at the AGM.Hewabowala graduated in rubber and polymer chemistry at the University of Moratuwa. After completing his studies, he joined a paint company as an employee from where he acquired the practical experience in paints and coatings industry. Later, he firmly decided to achieve his future aspirations with great confidence, hard work and dedication.
In 1979, he started a company named Silicone Coatings with the brand name of 'Nippolac' with three workers. Today, the 'Nippolac' brand is one of the market leaders in the paint industry and Silicone Coatings (Pvt) Ltd is on a strategic partnership with Nippon Paint, Asias No.1 Paint manufacturer in 2012.
Hewabowala is also the Managing Director of Can-tec Printing & Packing (Pvt) Ltd, Speciality Construction Chemicals (Pvt) Ltd and Resin & Polymer Technologies (Pvt) Ltd.
On election as the Chairman of the Ceylon National Chamber of Industries, the pioneering chamber for industries in the country, Hewabowala said that being a national Chamber, CNCI was responsible for representing the industrial sector and must take all possible measures to protect the local industries, encourage them and assist them in developing their businesses.
In this arena, the CNCI plays a number of significant roles: as a facilitator, as a mediator and as a consultant among many others. In todays business scenario, our industrialists face not only the challenges of the competition, but also various other external threats which are beyond the control of the respective businesses. At the same time, they have important obligations related to society and the environment. He further mentioned that the Sri Lankan industry had to face many negative experiences, due to various reasons in the immediate past. The 30 year war was a major drawback. Now with a peaceful atmosphere, a conducive backdrop has been created for industries. The government is focused on developing the private sector in the country.
"With such a supportive environment and current business trends, I feel that innovation and high technology should be the strategic themes of todays industry. We currently witness friendly foreign policies and the gaining of GSP Plus facilities and the governments encouraging of Foreign Direct Investors (FDIs) have become opportunities for the local industrialists, especially for emerging businesses," he said.
Hewabowala lastly highlighted that as an estimable national Chamber in the country, their real effort is to establish ethical business patterns and practices while facilitating a beneficial environment for all Sri Lankan industries.

Rebuilding India - Sri Lanka relations
The University of Kelaniya recently celebrated Hindi day. Prof Mohammad Gulrez, the visiting short term Chair of the Colombo Centre for Indian Studies (CCIS), recalled the fluency at which many Sri Lankan students eloquently recited poems in Hindi.
The Indian Government has offered 800 scholarships for Sri Lankan students every year; 300 of which are opportunities to study in India. Prof. Gulrez, who was also the former Chairman at the Department of West Asian and North African Studies at Aligarh Muslim University, India, envisioned a future of greater cultural collaboration between the two neighbouring countries.
It is a positive time for Sri Lanka, the wheel is moving, said Prof. Gulrez speaking at his office at CCIS recently. He hoped that this wheel would move closer towards India, a country Sri Lanka shares strong cultural and historical ties with.
India over the last two decades, has seen phenomenal growth and its government led by Prime Minister Narenda Modi has found itself waking up to the realisation that as an emerging power, they are not the only game in town.
India now wants to develop its relationship with Sri Lanka on a one to one basis; with mutual respect and open hands, respecting the sovereignty and dignity of the two countries, explained Prof. Gulrez.
He added that there was a change in the total profile, in the thinking of the Government of India towards Sri Lanka.
India is Sri Lankas second largest trading partner with trade relations increasing up to USD 4.6 billion annually. The two governments are also discussing on expanding this trade further through the Economic and Technology Cooperation Framework Agreement (ETCA). In addition, they have also taken positive steps to iron out one of the major issues of contention; fishing rights through high level talks.
This positive outlook has been helped by a more receptive government in Colombo and closer presence of China in the region.
A new chapter
During the previous Rajapaksa regime, there was a time when Sri Lanka was emphasising and targeting only economic relations with India but economic relations are not built on one stand-alone policy, said Prof. Gulrez.
They need to be supported by other parameters. Only then can you have robust economic relationship, he added.
One such parameter was the Indian involvement in the ethnic conflict, but since its disastrous involvement in the 1980s, the big brother of the Indian Ocean has learnt to take a back seat in internal conflicts.
India has realised in its own calculations that imposing pressure from above will not work. And the civil war was costly for both countries. Simultaneously, Sri Lanka is partly responsible for self-perpetuating the war. There is this realisation, not only in the neighbouring states of South Asia but also within the policy parameters of the government of India, explained Prof. Gulrez.
As a result, as Sri Lanka sat down to prepare its new Constitution over the last two years, there was a remarkable easing of pressure from across the Palk Strait. And whilst Prime Minister Modi in his first visit to Sri Lanka, made it clear in the Sri Lankan Parliament that power devolution was the way to go, the islanders themselves have had to sort out what kind of mechanism would work best for them. Opposition Leader, R. Sampanthan too in a recent meeting with media personnel was to remark that pressure from India in terms of the Constitution making process was considerably less unlike with the 13th Amendment. They now have other concerns, he said.
China, changing Indian Policy
These other concerns revolve around a fast expanding Chinese presence in the Indian Ocean region.
The aid which was coming into Sri Lanka, was coming through Japan, World Bank and IMF. But, when the war broke out, the aid coming from the World Bank and IMF reduced. This aid was being used for infrastructure development and it came with low interest and a long payback period. But when the aid dried up, in came China. Sri Lanka also looked towards, Iran, Russia and Libya- these were high interest and had quicker payment periods. But Sri Lanka needed this. However, after the war this trend could not be continued. Sri Lanka today is indebted up to USD 8 billion to China, said Prof. Gulrez as he voiced concerns over Chinese investments in the country.
One such worrying investment is the Hambantota Port. The government recently signed an agreement with China to convert its debt into equity.
These are the prime positions of an independent country, but because of the constraints, you have to bargain your sovereignty. Hambantota is rightly located in the Indian Ocean. To the East, it connects to the Middle East, Africa and South East Asia. In turn, this is a prime project in the Maritime Silk Road project of China, argued the Indian Professor.
Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe however, has continuously assured that the Port would not be used for any foreign military activity, but Prof Gulrez explained that the Chinese presence at the port was still worrying to India.
In peace time, there are good relations and all agreements are respected and obeyed, but when it comes to war, the respect for obligations is less. So this is not only in the interest of India but also Sri Lanka, he added.
In a bid to appease Indian fears, the government has invited the Indians to invest in the Trincomalee oil tanks once again and though the agreement was stalled due to local protests, Prof. Gulrez said the two deals were hardly comparable.
Land in the Colombo Port City was given to China on a 99 year lease, which is a long time. Whereas in Trincomalee, even if the deal was signed, it is only in respect to the old one signed in 2003 and it is only for 35 years, he said.
The point however is that India thus far has not come in for the big investments desperately needed by Sri Lanka. What India offers however, according to Prof. Gulrez, is less debt, open investments and democratic government.
As compared to China, all aid coming from India, is not debt. Whatever little resource India has it has invested in Northern houses, hospitals and railroads. I believe that because of our ethos and culture- we are a reliable partner, he said.
He added that Indian investments were closely scrutinized by its own Parliament and people, thus making its dealings more open.
When you see China investments in Africa, even the workers are imported from China, no one knows what happens in the projects. We believe in building partnerships on an equal basis, not one party investing and developing a China town, said Prof. Gulrez.
In every project, we want Sri Lanka to be a partner. We dont want to purchase 90 percent of shares, he added.
As an Indian scholar, the Professor was also quick to point out that whilst it was the sovereign right of any country to decide to whom it will have trade relations with and whom it will not, Hambantota was an eye opener in terms of how costly a Chinese investment can be.
String of Pearls
From Indias perspective, it sees Chinas presence in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Djibouti - which was recently occupied with Chinas first military base outside of its shores (2017). For China it is fine, but from the point of Indian security, it is worrying, he said.
Apart from Sri Lanka, China has invested in the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC); an investment of USD 50 billion. This too will have its road from occupied Kashmir, a disputed territory from our perspective, the Professor explained further.
We are keeping our eyes open on our borders, we cannot keep silent watching the string of pearls tighten. We have raised our concerns and I think Sri Lanka does share our concerns, he added.
Neighbourhood First
As Chinese presence grows around its own neighbourhood, India has started to look afresh at mending its own fences in the region.
Efforts in Bangladesh are reaping benefits now and we have settled the land border dispute. We are now working out a mechanism to share water between the two countries and improve trade investments. With Nepal too we share close relations, he explained.
With the neighbourhood first policy of Prime Minister Modi, the government has advocated for the Indian Ocean to be a zone of peace. His sentiments are similarly echoed by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe who wishes to see a more economically integrated Indian Ocean.
In the new political disposition, soon after PM Modi took office, he rightly placed two priorities in his foreign policy: one was faith in SAARC and the other in the Indian Ocean. Now India realises that the cultural strength and mobility within SAARC is so strong that it can work as a safety wall of Indias security, explained Prof. Gulrez.
SAARC however, has not delivered as expected. The 19th SAARC meeting scheduled to be held in Islamabad, Pakistan was cancelled last year due to tensions between Pakistan and India and according to Prof. Gulrez, the only organization which has not delivered. This leaves India no choice but to use its cultural and historical ties in the region to build more personal ties with the Indian Ocean littoral states in order to prevent them from drifting towards a more lucrative China.
Cooperation not only depends on goodwill of the countries in the region but also when agreed to by the big powers. In the post-cold war years, there is a need for countries to realise that basic issues have changed. Since you cannot invade a country with an army, efforts are being made to invade through infrastructure and technological advancement, reiterated Prof. Gulrez.
As a result, areas of soft power such as; the Buddhist circuit between India and Sri Lanka, the historical ties of culture and Tamil language, the presence of 78 embassies to which Sri Lanka is credited having its offices in India, the exchange of scholars between India and Sri Lanka, tourism, an online visa platform for Sri Lankans travelling to India and more direct flights between the two countries to have greater exchange of ideas and people, are being emphasized on.
In the last pay revisions of the Central Government officers in India, our leave travel concessions earlier only allowed visits in India, but now we can also visit Sri Lanka. This is a big leap forward in our relations, he explained further.
However, as Colombos skyline fills up with Chinese infrastructure, the optimistic Indian scholar stressed, We want to re-do what was missing in the last 27 years, we believe our relations are not simply based on economy but on the narrative of history and culture.

## Title: Reforming the police service
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Tuesday, September 26, 2017 - 01:00
Reforming the police service
The country's police force is to undergo a shake-up, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told a public gathering that followed the inauguration of the Police Officials Residential Complex at Wekunugoda, in Galle. He said new reforms will be introduced to make the police service more efficient and productive. He said; the Sri Lanka Police is administered and functions under very archaic laws and regulations which were introduced a long time ago. We plan to modernize our Police Force by introducing laws and regulations for an effective and productive service to the nation.
It is about time that our police force underwent a radical change and get out of the strait jacketed groove in which it operates, at present. The police force, constituted as it is, is lacking in dynamism and there is a feeling that it is merely going through the motions. Perhaps, the old moribund laws governing the service has stood in the way of advancement and the creation of a modern police force. There is also much disgruntlement in the service due to lack of recognition for career advancement and also the poor pay structure of the police, particularly where the bottom ranks are concerned. Steps should be taken to remedy this situation in order to get the best out of our police personnel.
No amount of new laws, or, attempts to modernize the police force, will succeed, unless discipline is given pride of place in the service. Regrettably, the police service has recently not exactly endeared itself to the public due to the actions of a minority in the force. The war years compelled the authorities to dispense with standards, and proper screening, when recruitment was carried out, due to the urgency in augmenting manpower to meet the challenge. As a result, certain bad eggs found their way into the service, whose actions resulted in the good name of the police being blackened. The war also brutalized segments within the police force, which manifested itself from time to time in the form of violent behaviour.
The nexus between the law enforcement and the underworld too has besmirched the service. Death of prisoners, while in police cells, too has forced the public to view the police with a jaundiced eye. A former Sports Minister once described the police, as being the second most corrupt public institution, behind the education sector and followed by the Cricket Board, and there is ample justification for this indictment. These shortcomings have got to be rectified, first, before the introduction of new laws to modernize and upgrade the police service.
The woes of the police personnel too has to be addressed at the same time. Presently, there is a lot of frustration in the service, as once mentioned by State Finance Minister Eran Wickramaratne, during a TV talk show. According to him, policemen are among the lowest paid public servants, who are called upon to perform a thankless job of protecting the citizenry and exposed to danger.
One should also not forget the not inconsiderable role played by the police, during the war. Many police personnel paid the supreme sacrifice, while on active duty in the operational areas. During the nascent stages of the Eelam war, the police, it was, who was in the initial firing line, falling prey to the terrorists when police stations in the north were overrun. In one of the blackest episodes of the Eelam war, some 600 policemen were gunned down, in cold blood, in the east, after surrendering to the LTTE, on the instructions of the government of the day.
We say this, because, there is today, a tendency to discount the role played by the police in the war, with the army, navy and the air-force hogging the limelight. Hence, the part played by the police, during the conflict, should also be duly recognized and the service elevated to comparable levels.
True, it is over eight years since the war ended, but there are still vestiges of the war mentality ingrained in the service, to a certain extent, given the actions and conduct of some members of the khaki brigade. While modernizing the police service is being spoken about, steps should also be taken to rid the service of this hangover and revert it to the purely, civilian law enforcement body that it used to be. Measures should also be taken to enhance police PR, which had suffered over the years. More and more programmes of police-public interaction should be organsied, such as sports events and shramadana campaigns.
The Premier also noted that there was poor response from Tamil youth, to join the police service, and that only 150 had responded to the 7,000 vacancies advertised by the government, which wanted to fill 10 percent of this number from the Tamil Community. In the past, the LTTE forbade Tamil youth from joining the police, but this threat is no longer there. Hence, concrete measures should be taken to encourage Tamil youth to join the police force, by building trust. After all, we have had Tamils as IGPs, in the past, who were well received by the majority community.

Reminiscences of SriLanka's tea industry
Chinese born Shen Nong, whose name means the Divine Farmer and who is considered as the ancient Chinese Father of agriculture, discovers tea. According to the legend, one fall afternoon, Shen Nong decided to take a rest under a Camellia tree and boiled some water to drink. Dried leaves from the tree above floated down into the pot of boiling water and infused with the water, creating a pot of rea, marking the first every infusion of the tea leaf.
Intrigued by the delightful fragrance, Shen Nong took a sip and found it refreshing. Since Shen Nongs discovery, tea has been grown and enjoyed throughout the world. In the beginning, tea was used in ritual offerings. Then tea leaves were eaten as a vegetable, or used in medicine. Until the Han Dynasty more than 2,000 years ago, tea was a new drink.
During the Sui Dynasty (581-618), tea was used for its medicinal qualities. In the fourth and fifth centuries, rice, salt, spices, ginger and orange peel, among other ingredients, were added to tea. In the Tang Dynasty (618-907), tea drinking became an art form and a drink enjoyed by all social classes. Tea became a popular drink in Buddhist monasteries after the caffeine proved to keep the monks awake during long hours of meditation. For this reason, many monasteries cultivated vast tea fields.
According to Sri Lankan archives, in 1824 a tea plant was brought to Ceylon by the British from China and was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens in Peradeniya. In 1841 Maurice (born Moritz) De Worms went on a voyage to China and brought back a few cuttings. They were China Jat and duly planted on Rothschild Estate (now managed by Pussellawa Plantations).
In the same year the then Government obtained two consignments of plants from China and Assam. Those from China were planted on Rothschild Estate and the Assam variety on Penyland Estate, Dolosbage.
In 1863 the Worms brothers retired from Ceylon. By this time they owned 12 properties, the largest of them Hopewell-Hunugalla was over 2,000 acres in Dimbula. Worms-Badulla was 904 acres (later Keenakelle); Condegalla in Ramboda was another. In all there were 7318 acres which were sold off for 157,000, according to the archives. However, James Taylor made his name as the Father of Ceylon Tea by planting tea commercially on Loolcondera Estate in Hewaheta in 1867.
Way forward for tea industry
The industry should focus on value not the volume whilst focusing consumer demand by:
Mainly focusing on the health benefits viz organic and inorganic green tea which are medically proven for immunity and detoxification of the human body. Producing and marketing organic green tea and black tea since the world demand is growing rapidly. Promote hand-made tea preferably organic which could be sold at an exorbitant price.
Give prominence to specialty green and black tea.
Produce more fusion tea which blends with fruits and Ayurveda herbs and has many health benefits.
Produce tea wine.
Promote carbonated tea.
Refuse tea-based energy drink (already experimented with green tea refuse  project in hand).
Bio-energy with tea refuse.
Extraction of polyphenols which could be used for pharmaceuticals, beverages, cosmetics, confectioneries, etc (already experimented with green tea powder  project in hand.)
New types of green tea products
Green tea has various components such as catechins, caffeine, amino acids vitamins, flavonoids, polysaccharides, fluorine, etc that are important for a healthy body.
Recently, in addition to the drinking of tea, wider application for tea and its components is being developed. And teas antoxidative, antibacterial, deodorant and other properties are being put to use in various fields such as the beverage market, dietetics and daily life implementation. New types of goods which are made from tea or its components are becoming increasingly popular.
Among new products are green tea cotton used to produce socks, t-shirts, polo shirts, towels and undergarment while in confectionery, there is candy chewing gum and biscuit.
Food for thought
Adding milk to tea will block normal healthful effects viz Casein from milk binds the molecules of tea (plant-based soya milk is good.
Water pH should be checked before supplying tea to any country).
Tea is a zero-calorie beverage.
Repeatedly boiling (tea) in the same water strips it of some of its oxygen and nitrogen, resulting in a dull beverage.

Road not taken
Road safety has become an issue of national concern, considering its magnitude and gravity and the consequent negative impacts on the economy, public health and the general welfare of the people. Today, road traffic accidents are one of the leading causes of deaths, disabilities and hospitalizations, with severe socio-economic costs, across the country.
Last year 39,000 road accidents resulted in 3117 deaths. Nearly half of these accidents involved motor cycles and three wheelers. The three most vulnerable groups who died due to these accidents were, motor cycle riders and pillion riders (1250), pedestrians (877) and three-wheeler drivers (370). These three groups accounted for 80% of the total number of road accident deaths.
Most of the road accident victims were between 15  40 years old - their most productive earning years. The costs and consequences of these losses are significant. The World Bank estimates that road traffic injuries cost 1 percent to 2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) of developing countries, or twice the total amount of development aid received worldwide by developing countries.
These are devastating statistics which indicate to us that road travel in Sri Lanka is becoming increasingly hazardous.
However, it is nothing to be surprised. We have 3.8 million motor cycles and 1.1 million three wheelers. Totally, we have 7 million registered vehicles in the country out of which minimum 6 million may be plying daily on our roads. The capacity and quality of our road network is definitely inadequate to safely accommodate this high volume of mixed traffic.
Causes of injury
The majority of our road accidents are caused by human error. This may include bad driving habits, distracted driving, drowsy driving, excess speeding, drunk driving, running red lights or stop signs, tailgating, unsafe lane changes, improper turns, road rage and number of others. Other than human errors, there can be many other causes including environmental or climatic issues, defects of vehicles or the uneven or badly maintained roads.
There is no doubt that building expressways, highways and major road links will contribute in a significant way to our countrys economic development. But on the flip side of this development, we will experience more road accidents resulting in injury or fatality, loss of man power, loss of productivity, high medical expenses, costly management and property damage which are estimated to bear a very high cost. It is like crossing the Rubicon. We have to continue with the planned road development while keeping road fatalities to the minimum level.
Profile of problem
Most of the road traffic accidents are predictable and preventable, but good data are important to understand the ways in which road safety interventions and technology can be successfully transferred from developed countries where they have proven effective. Unfortunately, the awareness of the consequences of road traffic accidents is lagging among Sri Lankan policymakers and the general public.
Therefore, what we really need today, as a priority, is the incorporation of a comprehensive road safety programme into a National Plan for Reduction of Road Accidents. The objective of the plan should be to understand the challenges we are facing, and formulate short and long-term measures to be implemented during the plan period. The period of the plan could be around 10 years.
However, within that period, interim targets could be assigned to keep track of the progress. For example, setting x percentage of fatalities and y percentage of severe accidents both per one million population every 3rd year of the National Transport Plan.
This should imply gradually reducing the average of deaths and injuries for the period 20182028. The Plan of Action should also include indicator targets for road user behaviour, the stock of vehicles and the road network. These are variables that indirectly describe the development of traffic safety.
In developed countries, road traffic death rates have decreased since the 1980s because of successful interventions such as National Plans, introduction of safety laws, enforcement of reckless driving, warnings about the dangers of mixing alcohol consumption with driving, and safer design and use of roads and vehicles. For example, in USA, the number of deaths per year decreased by an average 15% and number of fatalities per 100 million reduced from 2.47 in 1985 to 1.73 in 1995 to 1.12 in 2015.
Prevention interventions
Today most developed countries are adhering to the advice given by the World Bank and the World Health Organization, by adapting what is known as, a safe systems approach to road traffic safety.
This method emphasizes involvement at all levels of the road traffic system - from road providers and enforcers (vehicle sellers, road traffic planners, road safety engineers, police, educators, health professionals, and insurers) to road users. The Safe System design model has four main elements plus supporting activities that can be adjusted and applied in agreement with the four main elements to assist in making fatal accidents to be reduced.
The four main design elements are:
Safe roads and roadsides  they are designed to encourage safe driving and help avoid errors.
Safe speeds  travel speeds that suit the function and level of safety of the road. People understand and comply with the speed limits and drive to the conditions.
Safe vehicles  that prevent crashes and protect road users, including occupants, pedestrians and cyclists, in the event of a crash.
Safe road users  road users that are alert and unimpaired, and who comply with road rules. They take steps to improve safety, and demand and expect safety improvements.
The key supporting Safe System elements include: emergency medical management for post-accident care; understanding of accidents on the network, which requires good data to enable risks across sections of the network to be accurately identified; control of admittance (entry and exit) of drivers to/from the road transport system); effective legislation and systems, enforcement and justice system support; educating and informing the public.

Russia warned to accept McLaren results as WADA plans audit
Paris: Russia was warned by WADA on Sunday that it must "publically accept" the McLaren report on state-sponsored doping in the country as officials prepared to visit Moscow to audit anti-doping progress.
The McLaren report, released in 2015, alleged state-sponsored doping in Russia from 2011 to 2015.
The investigation said the cheating peaked at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Black Sea resort of Sochi where Russian secret agents engineered an elaborate system of state-backed doping.
Russia's own anti-doping body RUSADA was declared "non-compliant" while the country's track and field team was banned from the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics. On Sunday, WADA's executive committee said they were emphasising three points:
+ That the responsible authorities for anti-doping in Russia must publically accept the reported outcomes of the McLaren Investigation.
+ That the Russian Government must provide access for appropriate entities to the stored urine samples in the Moscow Laboratory. These samples are sealed off due to a Federal investigation.
+ That WADA audits RUSADA, which will be carried out the week of 25 September 2017.
There are still questions over Russia's participation at the next Winter Olympics in PyeongChang in February, 2018. AFP

A highlight was the donation of Rs.1.6 million by Sri Lanka Cricket towards the setting up of the office complex. The cheque was handed over by SLC president to the ACU treasurer, Roshan Dhammika soon after the opening.
Making the welcome speech at the location P. Sara Oval with the ceremonial opening Pathirana said that it was a dream come true for the black coated fraternity who perform a thankless job in the middle who had unfortunately not had an office of their own for so many years.
Pathirana had a special word of appreciation and gratitude to the SLC president for the magnanimous donation of Rs.1.6 million towards the cause. He observed that he had not wanted to contest for president of the ACU, but had come forward as he was called upon by a unanimous decision by the associations executive membership.
He noted that cricket and politics had a similarity where you win and lose. Of course, I look for the day when the Association of Cricket Umpires could have a permanent land to set up its headquarters before long as the current complex is on a rental, Pathirana said.
President of SLC, Thilanga Sumathipla, while expressing his pleasure at the ACU realizing a long felt dream, said that SLC would donate a further Rs.5 million towards helping the umpires of this parent body of the black and white coated fraternity set up a headquarters office that they could call their own.
For the record, the ACU was the official parent body for umpires in Sri Lanka, and the untiring services of this fraternity that was an integral link to cricket activity in the middle deserved all praise.
Among those associated at the opening were SLC secretary, Mohan de Silva, SLC Chief Executive Officer Ashley de Silva, Nishan Danasinghe, former cricketer and member of the ACU and president, Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association, Oshara Panditharatne.

Tense situation at Kurnegala over Central Expressway project

A tense situation arose in Kurnegala last evening when government officials and Ministers met to discuss issues regarding the Central Expressway at the Nailiya Viharasthanaya.
The officials and Ministers had to be escorted out of the premises under police security as negotiations turned into a protest.
The discussion was with regard to the section being built from Pothuhera to Kurunegala.
Around 200 residents from Amunawatte, Henmulla, Weherabanda, Gattuwana and Boyagana had come for discussions and protested that they would all be losing land to the Expressway.
On behalf of the government, Deputy Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Ashok Abeysinghe, Chairman of the Road Development Authority, Nihal Sooriyarachchi, Kurunegala Divisional Secretary, Mahinda Ekanayake and officers were present.
At the commencement of the meeting Sooriyarachchi tried to explain matters regarding the Central Expressway but the residents of the area kept interrupting him and voicing their protests. Thereafter the discussions heated up.
The residents strongly insisted that the expressway be built on columns to avoid effects of flooding, to pay adequate compensation and to make transparent the system of compensation.
Amidst the protests by residents, Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe tried to address the gathering but due to the crowd shouting at the Minister, a heated exchange of words took place.
The residents having prepared a petition with their demands had handed it over to the Deputy Minister and asked that he in writing assure them that their demands would be met but the Deputy Minister had pointed out that he did not have the authority to meet such demands and thus the discussions turned ugly.
As the situation worsened, the police decreed that the government officials leave the meeting.
As the officials left, the residents in the area booed at them in protest.
Those who participated in the discussions then proceeded to march towards the Boyagane-Malpitiya junction, a kilometer away from the temple and they blocked the Kurunegala-Colombo main road in protest.
This caused heavy traffic congestion in the area for over three hours.
The situation was resolved when the Kurunegala ASP who came to the place promised to get them a meeting with the Minister of Transport and Prime Minister to resolve the issue further.

Uber seeks talks with London mayor to renew licence
Uber could make concessions to ensure its London operating licence is renewed, its chief in the capital says.
Tom Elvidge told a newspaper the ride-hailing app firm would like to know what we can do, but that would require talks with Transport for London (TfL).
It came as Labour and Britain's biggest union heaped criticism on Uber - something Minister for London Greg Hands said was astonishing.
TfL says the company is not fit to hold a private hire operator licence.
Mr Elvidge, the firm's London general manager, told the Sunday Times: While we haven't been asked to make any changes, we'd like to know what we can do. He added: That requires a dialogue we sadly haven't been able to have.
A TfL spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment further.
Uber has been asking to meet Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, since his election in May 2016 but those requests have been rejected, according to sources close to the US company.
More than 680,000 people have signed an online petition in a bid to keep Uber operating in London after its licence expires on 30 September. It has 21 days to appeal TfL's decision and can continue to provide its services in the capital until the appeals process has been exhausted - a point Mr Khan reiterated in a response to the change.org petition.
TfL cited failures to report serious criminal offences, conduct sufficient background checks on drivers and other safety issues as grounds for not renewing Uber's licence.
Concessions by Uber are likely to centre on passenger safety and benefits for drivers, limits on their working hours, and holiday pay.
Despite the more conciliatory language from Mr Elvidge, Uber said in a series of tweets on Sunday that it would challenge the TfL decision in the courts to defend the livelihoods of drivers and the consumer choice of millions of Londoners who use Uber.
Drivers who use Uber in London are licensed by TfL and have been through the same enhanced DBS [Disclosure and Barring Service] background checks as black cab drivers. (BBC)

Vitamin C infused in skincare products protects skin from sun damage and harmful rays. This ingredient also helps to smoothen out dark spots for a clearer skin.

We must strengthen the agro economy: Amunugama
Minister of Special Assignments Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Vice President of the SLFP and SLFP Chief Organiser, Galagedara electorate, addressing a meeting of farmer representatives held at his political office at Galagedara said that it is necessary to strengthen domestic agriculture which is like the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy and that such action will make it possible to raise the standard of living of the people of Sri Lanka.
Speaking further the Minister said, "Agriculture is still the backbone of the economy of the country. Today the contribution of agriculture to the GDP has reduced to about 8 percent. However, in 1990 it was about 26 percent. Due to the services sector of the economy displacing traditional agriculture in the economy, considerable changes have occurred in the country. However, we should not forget that still about 70 percent of the rural and estate populations still depend on agriculture. We as a government are directing the economy according to a plan to raise their standard of living."
He said we must realize that the economy of a country will not be strengthened by shouting on platforms, by going on strike and by conducting protests. Those, he said will only harm the country. The government's attempt is to provide the facilities required by the farmer and the small time businessman in the village and develop the economy of the country.
"We can say that our agriculture consists of the growing of paddy, vegetables and fruits. Export agriculture including spices, ornamental plants, flowers etc. Statistics show that these crops are spread over about one million hectares of land. Of this about 70 percent is accounted for by paddy.
It is necessary to increase this crop acreage and also to increase agricultural exports. Thereby the income of the country will increase. It is also the effort of the government to enhance the income of the people engaged in these fields and thereby take them to a higher standard of living. We must remember that these are the people who earn the countrys income, who feed the country and who are our lifeline. It is the prime effort of our government and our party to uplift these peoples lives and to regenerate the countrys agro economy," he added. Due to the production of field crops such as big onions, red onions, potatoes, chillies, gingerly, ground nuts etc being insufficient, we are compelled to import them. Especially in the case of the main imported crops, potatoes, onions, maize and chillies, the government had to spend US $ 161 million in 2015 alone to import them. If these crops are grown in sufficient quantity in the country we can save billions of dollars annually.
The standard of living of the rural people can be enhanced only by increasing local production. Therefore, the aim of the Government and the President is to increase local production, raise national income and develop the country. To develop the country the economy must be directed according to a plan. The government is dedicated to do that.
No country can go forward through agitations, protests and strikes, said Amunugama adding that for a country to go forward the people must work. Production must be increased.
"It is necessary to say that the service rendered to the country by farmers like you is immeasurable in comparison to those who conduct agitations to destabilize the county. What you are doing is increasing the production and increasing the income of the country. A country will progress only through such action," he noted.

'World's heaviest woman' dies

Eman Abdul Atti, once believed to be the "world's heaviest woman," died on Monday due to complications from heart disease and kidney dysfunction, according to a statement from Burjeel Hospital in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates.
The 37-year old Egyptian woman weighed 1,102 pounds (500 kg), her family reported, prior to undergoing weight reduction surgery at Saifee Hospital in Mumbai in March.
All signs looked positive immediately following the surgery for Eman, who had lost more than 200 pounds prior to the operation.
"She is very happy, she started dancing in her bed," Dr. Muffazal Lakdawala, the surgeon who performed her laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy operation, told CNN in March. "Her smile has come back." Theprocedureinvolves removing part of the stomach so that only a "sleeve," roughly the size and shape of a banana, is left behind, along with the muscle that controls emptying food into the intestine.

On September 9, Eman celebrated her 37th birthday.

Eman's family said Eman had weighed 11 pounds (5 kg) at birth and suffered from thyroid problems since she was a child. Thethyroidgland produces hormones that help regulate metabolism. By fifth grade, she'd stopped going to school because she'd begun to have difficulties moving and walking.

For the past two decades, Eman has barely left her room, her family reported. She suffered a stroke and, unable to move or communicate, her weight increased to more than 1,000 pounds. Her health deteriorated rapidly.
Her sister created a social media campaign last year and Lakdawala responded by offering to help. His proposed three-and-a-half year plan including two operations to help her reduce her weight to less than 220 pounds (100kg).

Eman overcame a number of hurdles to reach what her family had hoped to be a life-saving surgery in Mumbai, including an initial refusal to grant her a visa because of her inability to get to the embassy in person. After surmounting that problem with the help of an Indian minister, she then faced the difficulty of boarding an airplane.

Egypt Air specially adapted a cargo plane to transport her to India.

Following the surgery, Lakdawala said her kidney function had improved.

"She has done well post-surgery," he told CNN in March. At that time, he intended for her to lose another 155 to 175 pounds (70 to 80 kg) within the next couple of months. The plan was to then send her home to Egypt and schedule a second surgery for next year.

Eman was later transferred to Burjeel Hospital in Abu Dhabi. There, her condition was managed by a medical team of more than 20 doctors in different specialties.
However, her heart and kidneys could no longer function.

Her family expressed appreciation for the care provided by Burjeel Hospital and the support of the people of the UAE, according to the hospital statement. "Our prayers and heartfelt condolences go out to her family," Burjeel Hospital staff said in the statement.

Rapid rise in Sri Lankans migrants
Sri Lankans leaving the country for employment, studies, settlement and other purposes shows an increasing trend over the past few years, the Senior Registrar in Community Medicine and the Head of the Health Care Quality Unit of the Department of Health in the Southern Province, Dr. Amila Chandrasiri said.
Around 500,000 people undergo migrant health assessments every year. But in most instances, this is done as a requirement of destination country and not linked with referral and treatment services. Therefore, it doesnt bring any benefit for the person and the country of origin, he said.
The International Consultation on Pre-Departure Health Assessments Migrant health assessments as a global public health good will be held from September 26 to 27 at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo, Sri Lanka, he said. According to Dr. Chandrasiri, the Sri Lankan Health Ministry is finalising the National Guideline on Pre-Departure Migrant Health Assessment Services with the technical support of International Organization for Migrant to strengthen the pre-departure health assessment services in the country and provide optimum care for the state health system.
"But this opportunity will help Sri Lanka to detect previously unknown disease conditions, refer them to proper medical care and ultimately reduce the disease burden in the country and in world as a whole. "Therefore, its high time to incorporate this Pre Departure Health Assessment to the national health service and respective disease control programmes.

Abans success - now a case study at Harvard Business School
Aban Pestonjee, founder chairperson of Abans, was invited to be interviewed by Professor Geoffrey Jones, the faculty chair of Harvard Business School's Business History Initiative on the topic 'Creating Emerging Markets'. This is a singular honour not only for Pestonjee and Abans, but for Sri Lanka.
The Harvard Business School is the graduate business school of Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts, USA and is one of the world's most prestigious business schools from which global corporate leaders receive their MBAs and Doctorates.
The two-hour long video interview was a sit-down discussion between Professor Jones and Pestonjee and was conducted at the Sapphire Room of Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai.
The full transcript of the interview will be kept in the archives of Harvard Business School's Baker Library and will become a part of the library's historical collection and the Creating Emerging Markets website and will be available to students for research and case studies.
The interview which received comments of wide acclaim from those present at the recording covered many topics such as 'The process of innovation in business'; 'The acquisition of international technologies'; 'The role of family'; 'The issue of succession'; 'The recruitment of professional management'; 'Relationships with government, NGOs and international organizations'; 'Responsibility for society and natural environment' and the 'Challenges and opportunities of globalization including globalizing brands'.
The phenomenal success of Abans from a small retail shop selling used home appliances to the market leader in electronics and household appliances with 30 independent companies in diversified fields of business and services and a network of over 400 showrooms, dealers and service centers islandwide is a remarkable achievement.
Abans newest venture is the multi billion rupee Colombo City Centre, a mixed development project on Sir James Peiris Mawatha, Colombo 2, overlooking the picturesque Beira Lake. In keeping with its policy of always looking to introduce new technology to Sri Lanka, Abans has ventured into developing the first-ever lifestyle mall and mixed development project, the likes of which are hitherto found only in highly developed countries like Dubai, USA and Singapore.
The mall will feature attractions for tourists as well as locals who can come and spend an enjoyable day with their families.
Being an impressive piece of innovative architecture and engineering, the 48-storey lifestyle centre will feature a contemporary lifestyle retail mall, an upscale hotel operated by Next Hotels - the flagship brand of Silver Needle Hospitality and opulent apartment residencies.
The high-calibre retail mall will feature a range of global brands that will promise a never-before-seen shopping experience to Sri Lankans.
The centre will also feature a six-screen multiplex with the best movies throughout the day, an international food court and various unique entertainment and leisure activities that will provide a radical take on how Sri Lankan families and tourists could spend the whole day relaxing and enjoying.

Anandian Brendon Kuruppu broke a world record on debut
Greatness was firmly trust upon the Sri Lankan wicket keeper opener Brendon Kuruppu, although it was short lived, only for a day or two. He also became only the third person to score a double century on his Test debut, against New Zealand with Richard Hadlee and Co at the CCC in Colombo. Kuruppu did it the hard way too, his 777-minute innings was the slowest double hundred in first-class cricket history then. This was quite out of character for a man who later made his reputation as a one-day slogger. It was also his first, first-class century and to cap it all his last Test century as well.
This dashing right-hander with a ram rod straight back lift used to strike the ball at will through the arc between mid-off and mid-on. In spite of all his inborn talent both in front and back of the stumps, Kuruppu only played four Tests, two of them in England in 1988 and 1991.
With the end of the first test, in the New Zealand series, the bomb blast at the Pettah bus stand sent the New Zealanders scurrying back home with two more tests to be played.This incident occurred, when a powerful bomb containing 25 kilograms of gelignite had been planted inside a secret compartment of a red Ford Escort car that was parked in front of one of the eight shops on the ground floor of the Central Bus Stand building.
It was an era where there was not only a dearth in Test cricket for Sri Lanka. Peace and calm was also not the order and as a result not many Test matches were played in the country.
Kuruppu in his four Test match career spanning 7 innings gathered 320 runs at an average of 53.33. Due to his aggressive approach, he was an automatic choice for the 1983 and 1987 World Cups held in England and, India and Pakistan.
In his 54 ODIs, Kuruppu scored over 1022 runs with the highest of 72. He made his Test debut at the CCC grounds against New Zealand in April 1987 where he shone like a beacon. He played his last Test against England at Lords in 1991. He became the third player in Test cricket history to reach the double century mark on debut, the others were Pakistans Hanif Mohammed and Englands Len Hutton.
Kuruppu also created another record in that Test, being with his pads on throughout, as he was the wicket-keeper of the side.
In his marathon innings, his opening partner was Roshan Mahanama. Kuruppu carried his bat out for 201 runs spending 777 minutes, facing 548 deliveries and reached the pickets on 24 occasions.
In this encounter, it is interesting to note that neither side considered entertainment an option and on day five; the days play was reduced to a formality. Wisden wrote: Time had ceased to matter. The spectators lost interest, and not even free admission could attract them to watch as Martin Crowe and Richard Hadlee batted throughout the final day.
Play was called off 16 overs before the stipulated time, the moment Hadlee reached his 150. He remained unbeaten on 151 (with 14 fours and 2 sixes), scored from 240 balls over 406 minutes. Almost as a contrast, Jeff Crowes 120 not out took up 398 balls and 609 minutes: he had 13 fours to the fence.
The other 2 Tests at Kandy and SSC were abandoned without a ball bowled due to the security situation in the country.
It is heartening to note that the security situation is quite in order in the country at present, although the other factors that affects Sri Lanka cricket is not in proper order. According to reports Sri Lanka team manager Asanka Gurusinha says former skipper Angelo Mathews is eager to be part of the One Day International squad as an all-rounder.
Mathews has had a long history of injuries and the veteran all-rounder has served more time off the field in the past 12 months than ever before in his career.
The former Sri Lanka skipper has also been ruled out of the opening Test against Pakistan with a grade one tear to his calf muscle, sustained during a training session.
However speaking to media the team manager and national selector Gurusinha said Mathews has expressed his willingness to play the all-rounders role in white-ball cricket.
Gurusinha also noted that Mathews contribution with the bat and his experience alone will merit a place in the national side and therefore the team is eager to safeguard the player.
Mathews has been solely playing as a batter in Test matches for a period of time.
In my humble opinion Mathews is as good as gold but----- why does he not click and perform to his true potential; your guess is as good as mine.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka team left for United Arab Emirates on Sunday to take on Pakistan on a full tour. They have a gigantic task ahead of them, with a pink ball game also thrown in. Let us all wish Dinesh Chandimal and Upul Tharanga all the very best where they have to face a rugged road ahead of them!

N. R. J. Aaron: Man with a golden heart
It was in the early 1980s, when I joined the Daily News as a sub editor, that I met N. R. J. Aaron. During my stint at the Sun, where I was freelancing as an undergraduate at the Sri Jayawardenapura University, I had heard of him, but this was the first time that I was seeing him in person.
I expected to see a burly authoritative person, instead it was a small made man with a wide grin who greeted me. His smile made me most welcome and I was already feeling at home.
Although I was not directly under him, when handling local pages, especially in the nights, we used to have contact him as he used to hand over the local news copies, which in those days were either hand written or typed.
He used to come to office around 10 am and leave around 9.30 pm. When we came to office around 4.00 pm for the night shift he had already gathered the news and would have them over to us. He was a man who believed in deadlines and he expected this from everyone.
Aaron never demanded how the sub editor should go about the layout, but if he wanted something given prominence, he would simply come to you and tell; Riza can you please box that story. He never needed to do so, instead could have ordered us to do so. The word 'please' was widely used by him, which I think was why he gained the respect of all the subs.
Years after he left, I remember him calling me at the Daily News and congratulating me. How he knew I had got a promotion remains a mystery till today, as he never divulged who told him. Just two weeks before I left the Daily News, Aaron called me and inquired about the paper. He also spoke about Malcolm Viduranpillai, who was the head of the VDT Department, and had passed away a couple of weeks ago.
Aaron was very happy that the Daily News was doing well and said he read the paper daily. He spoke about the past and said he was very happy to see most of the juniors doing well. I remember him mentioning P. Balasingham, who retired from the Daily News, Dr. Ranga Kalansooriya, present Director General of the Government Information, Rodney Martinez, Senior Associate Editor of the Daily News, Pramod de Silva, Consultant Editor of the Sunday Observer and Dudley Jansz, senior journalist, who also retired from the Sunday Observer.
Listening to him made me feel that he missed the good old days spent in the Daily News Editorial. He must have missed walking along the corridors, chit chatting while sipping tea brought from the canteen, browsing through the papers in the library.
It is rarely we come across people like Aaron. He never ran you down, always had a good word about everyone and never back stabbed. If he did not like something. he would confront you and the matter was settled.
We have lost a dedicated journalist, but moreover a man with a golden heart.

Battle of Stalingrad : Turning Point of World War II
With a force like the 6th army, I could storm the heavens - Adolf Hitler
As the surprise Soviet counter-offensive of the winter of 1941 petered out in the freezing snows of the Russian wilderness the minds of the German war planners began to turn to the inevitable summer campaign ahead, their successive offensive against a bloodied but defiant enemy.
Six months before on the 22nd of June 1941 the awesome German war machine, seemingly unstoppable, had launched itself at Russia - the largest country in the world, with a sudden and devastating ferocity. For this unparalleled attack the Germans had divided their 4 million strong striking force into three large army groups. Army Group North was to dash up to Leningrad, while bringing the Baltic area under its heel. The task of the exceptionally strong Army Group Centre was to thrust in to the Russia heartland with Moscow as the desired long stop. The Donnets River was the ambitious summer target for the Army Group South, with Ukraine and Crimea as the rich prizes.
Only from an army of the calibre of the German Wehrmacht could a task of such ambitious scale be demanded. No army in history had to conquer a land as vast and an enemy as formidable in just one furious campaign. To even contemplate such an undertaking the attacker had to possess outstanding soldiery combined with a capacity for extraordinary economic efficiency. Germany was obviously blessed with both.
The war opened dazzlingly for the Teutonic warriors. Punching huge gaps in the bewildered enemy defense lines the formidable Panzer divisions of the Germans streaked across the Russian plains leaving the mopping up to the slower infantry divisions. These highly trained men of the infantry, while fighting, regularly marched 30 miles a day determined to keep cohesion with their comrades in the armoured units relentlessly moving eastward.
Human resources
But the country, that Germany had now locked horns with was immense, and the enemy exceedingly tough. It is testimony to the superlative quality of German arms that they, hopelessly over-stretched after six months of continuous fighting, almost achieved victory. In the north they surrounded Leningrad and imposed a crippling siege on the city. In the center, German reconnaissance units stomped through knee high snow to the outskirts of Moscow. In the south most of Ukraine was theirs.
But the Russian bear, though dreadfully mauled, was refusing to lie down. In this huge gamble the Germans had taken, even a near victory amounted to a long term defeat. Although they were now deep in Russia, given the size of the country and its seemingly endless human resources, the enemy was still in a position to continue resisting strongly. The failure of the Wehrmacht to achieve total and essential victory in 1941 now necessitated a renewed offensive, which had to bring the enemy to heel once and for all. But after the dreadful winter battles of 1941, when Russians launched quite an effective counter punch, the Germans were not in a position to renew the attack on all three fronts. After much consideration they picked on the economically vital Southern Front, hoping their superior military could administer such a crippling blow to the Russians that they would be compelled to surrender. The Army Groups North and Centre were to remain on a defensive posture with a few local offensives to keep the Russian defenders pinned down.
For the gigantic attack of 1942 the Army Group South was reorganised with Field Marshall Von Bock in overall charge. Under his command were several armies including the 2nd army, 17th army, the 6th army, the 1st Panzer army and the 4th Panzer army. Each of these armies was capable of delivering a crippling blow to the enemy while the 6th was particularly strong with 11 divisions and an entire Panzer Corps in its establishment. Operation Blue as the plan was named, though somewhat vague on its final objectives, envisaged among other things; reaching the Volga, bringing the large city of Stalingrad under control and gaining the Eastern Caucasus during the campaign. Again it was hoped that by menacing this vital area they could compel the Soviets to commit its precious reserves, presenting the Germans thus with an opportunity to force the issue.
The Germans had no doubts about the superiority of their fighting men. Repeatedly, they had observed the wooden orthodoxy and the clumsy battle tactics of the Russian commanders. In contrast the Germans were trained and encouraged to fight resourcefully. When necessary their commanders did not hesitate to adopt bold initiatives and unconventional methods. Rather than attempting to overwhelm the enemy with superior numbers or often wasteful firepower, the Wehrmacht embraced the idea of effectively paralyzing their foe with numbing speed.
On 28th of June 1942, on an overcast day, Von Bock opened his offensive with predictable ferocity, within days splitting the Russian front in to rapidly disintegrating fragments. Once again the vaunted armoured divisions of the Germans advanced East across the massive steppe seeking an opportunity to mortally wound the enemy.
Not only were they assured of their military supremacy, the Germans were also convinced of their racial superiority over an enemy their internal military magazines routinely described in disparaging terms such as- degenerate looking Orientals, begging whining Asians, a mixture of low and the lowest humanity, truly subhuman.
On the 22nd of August 1942 elements of the German 6th Army, now under command of General Paulus, reached the Volga, in the borders of the Asian continent, a remarkable advance since June of 1941. Stalingrad, the city carrying the name of the Soviet dictator was in sight, tantalizingly within grasp. On the 23rd of August with predictable efficiency the German Air Force began carpet-bombing the ill-fated city. The resulting fires turned Stalingrad in to a burning inferno of collapsed buildings, rubble and thick smoke.
No human force could resist the German firepower in those conditions. Hitler who had baulked at the idea of committing his troops to city fighting in Moscow and Leningrad the previous year, now decided that he must have Stalingrad. Perhaps less sanguinely, but certainly with grim determination, Stalin had also decided that Russia would not retreat any further.
So began the epic struggle between these two implacable enemies for a burnt out patch of the earth, which finally became the turning point of the Second World War.
For the valiant Russian defenders there was little choice. They faced the fury of the German guns well aware that retreat only meant drowning in the freezing waters of the Volga. Besides, Stalin who knew how to impose his will had placed Secret Service Police detachments in the rear with strict orders to summarily execute any Russian soldier disobeying the order to hold their ground to death. Such was their iron determination to give no further ground that the Russians executed nearly 14,000 of their own men for the offence of showing cowardice alone during the battle for Stalingrad.
Armys administration
For the Germans, the battle for Stalingrad turned their world upside down. Their armoured divisions trained to capture something like 50 miles a day, were now advancing at snail pace, attempting to subdue burning city squares against an enemy who rarely showed himself. One single building would change hands several times in a day, each battle only adding to the corpses lying on the floor. In such close quarter fighting German planes and tanks were often unable to join effectively through the fear of hitting their own.
A Lieutenant with the German 24th Panzer division described the battlefield thus Stalingrad is no longer a city. By day it is an enormous cloud of burning, blinding smoke; it is a vast furnace lit by the reflection of the flames. And when the nights arrive, one of those scorching, howling, bleeding nights, the dogs plunge in to the Volga and swim desperately to gain the other bank. The nights of Stalingrad are a terror for them. Animals flee this hell; the hardest stones cannot bear it for any long; only men endure. While the fearsome battle was raging in this man-made hell-hole of a burning city hundreds of powerful German divisions were holding their impossibly long front line from the Baltic Sea to the Caucasus Mountains, many almost on an R & R mode. General Paulus himself could only commit eight of the divisions of the 6th Army to the crucial battle in the city while assigning eleven divisions under his command to guard the large area under the Armys administration and his almost 200 mile long exposed flanks.
As the battle raged on in to the Russian winter many a General warned of the dangers inherent in a prestige battle, where the German army was paying a price totally out of proportion to the citys fast diminishing strategic importance. But the majority of the high command including Hitler, who held the Russians in contempt, could not conceive of a large-scale counteroffensive by them.
The Wehrmacht, which had traditionally prided itself on its cold rationality, was now acting increasingly on hateful prejudices, arrogance and unwarranted optimism. So General Paulus, the harried commander of the 6th Army, considered a competent staff officer, if slow-witted and unimaginative in the field, continued with tactics designed to grind down the enemy inch by inch, an approach which was essentially counter-productive to the numerically weaker but technically superior Germans.

Birthright buried alive
The old gentleman turned to look out the window at the icy weather. The winter is here, and not gone yet. Droplets of a mild snowy rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel heartbreaking. However hard he threw himself to forget all that, he would oftentimes roll back to where and what he used to be a few decades ago.
Her father in law would fondly recall the golden rays of sun rising above the vast swathes of tea estates. He takes a while to reflect those good old times. He was a periya dorai (big master) running a tea estate with a large Tamil workforce under his command. With children sent to the private Catholic colleges, his was the favoured lot in the island entitled to huge salaries, bungalows and many other perks.
That privileged status was not to last long, however, with the British leaving the island to the locals in 1948. This background and the foreground of her father in law furnished Thelma Wheatleys latest work Tamarind Sky. Wheatleys forte has been non-fiction so far, but she weaves Tamarind Sky as a pure work of fiction based on her real-life experiences of a marriage to a Eurasian Sinhalese from British Colonial Ceylon.
Country wife
I have made things up in this novel based on my experience. The story is about Selena, her Eurasian husband and her father in law, Thomas Gilmor.
The British were in Ceylon to make fortunes from tea, rubber and hemp. Their biggest cash crop was tea. With a wife back in England, the British tea planters did not mind reaching out for a mistress in Ceylon. She was considered a country wife. Although a legal bonding was not likely to occur, it was a given marriage in the local context. Consequently, the offspring were not registered as well.
And thats where Wheatleys theme appears.
Most of the white people were mistaken for British. They were actually Eurasians. The British owned the tea estates, and they entrusted the Eurasians with the job of running the estates. The Eurasians were the offspring of the mixed marriages between the British and the locals. They were half British half Ceylonese, Wheatley offers an introduction to this tribe which now seems to be lost forever.
Although Eurasians communicated in the Queens lingo, most of them were conversant in Sinhalese as well. Welsh-born Thelmas husband, a Eurasian, was one of them as he was brought up with the Sinhalese. Yet English was the superior language while Christianity was the superior religion. The lions share of the state coffers was channeled to the private Catholic colleges while a little left was allocated to the Buddhist schools.
Fair Eurasians
The Eurasians claimed enormous authority across the island. But they were not without concerns. Not all the Eurasians were fair-skinned. As a result of getting married to the locals, the Eurasians sometimes turned out to be dark in their complexion. For instance, Thelmas mother in law was dark-skinned. Thelmas son was dark while her daughter was fair. The fair Eurasians secured the best jobs.
The Eurasians had a wonderful life. They had personal horses. They spent evenings in clubs. The bachelors would often go to Colombo, bring down the prostitutes over the long weekends and send them back.
The power they enjoyed without boundaries came from the British colonial masters.
Tables began to turn hot on the heels of the 1948-Independence episode. Sinhalese was made the official language while Buddhism was recognised as the state religion. The monies were taken away from the private Catholic colleges and channeled to the Buddhist schools.
Controversial bill
It became even worse with the government, dominated by the locals, introducing a controversial bill called Ceylon Citizenship Act in 1948 which stipulated that anyone wishing to obtain citizenship had to prove that their father was born in Ceylon (that they were at least third generation born in the country). Most of the Eurasians had no documentation to support their birthright since their grandfathers had not registered the marriages with country wives. They had no option but to emigrate to countries such as Britain, Canada and Australia.
The part I of Tamarind Sky centres around that experience in Canada when multiculturalism seeped in under the government of the then Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the father of Canadas incumbent Prime Minister. In part I of the novel  chronologically four decades ahead of Part II - the reader runs into Selenas father in law, no longer endowed with the luxuries of a huge bungalow and servants at the beck and call.
But then why Tamarind Sky
You have of course heard of tamarind, a commonly seen pod-like fruit in this land. And you are familiar with its taste too: strong, sour and yet sweet to a certain extent. Quit recalling what else you felt savouring the fruit, and be attentive to Wheatley.
Golden sunrays
It is like life. It is sour as well as sweet. But it refers to the life we had back in Ceylon too. My father in law, just like Selenas father in law, becomes nostalgic whenever he remembers those tea estates during the winter. Those golden sunrays blossoming over the tamarind trees would never be forgotten.
Tamarind Sky is more than a mere eponymous title. It signifies a particular era of this land and a race forgotten. Wheatleys fiction is split into two parts signifying a kind of discrimination that particular race had to undergo in two different C-spheres of the planet: Canada and Ceylon. Canada did not provide them with the prestige of the private colleges and other perks that Ceylon offered.
But it is not completely a story of regret, sadness and nostalgia. The story unfolds in Toronto between a Welsh girl married to a Eurasian from Ceylon. Selena feels alone in Canada with her family still in Britain.
The Eurasians are now a lost white tribe  almost, at least. Leafing through Thelma Wheatleys Tamarind Sky, you will run into myriads of mixed and interracial marriages. Her plot looks straight across into bonding between these marriages.
An excerpt From Tamarind Sky
I surreptitiously observe Father-in-law as I eat. His fair English features are clear-cut and chiselled next to Aidans dark, powerful face with deep-set eyes. Aidan obviously follows Mother-in-laws Sinhalese side of the family in Ceylon. I note thoughtfully. Its something I hadnt really taken in in the first throes of romance when we met here in Willowdale six months ago. Now I cant seem to keep myself from scrutinizing these members of my new family, my new in-laws through marriage. Skin hue, colour of eye, hair, build, even facial expressions all come under my hidden, dark scrutiny, though what is it Im trying to clarify Id tried to explain to Mother before the wedding that Aidan was half-British half Sinhalese from Ceylon, the island at the foot of the Indian subcontinent where all the tea came from. He called himself Eurasian, I said.
Grand-daughter of a Welsh coal-miner, Thelma Wheatley emigrated to Canada as an adult and took a Masters Degree in English at York University and other graduate work in Special Education at Toronto University. She married a Sri Lankan who grew up under British colonialism in the tea planter milieu of former Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, on which the novel is based. She has two children, and lives in the Greater Toronto Area with her cat but has made several visits to Sri Lanka. She began writing later in life and her work has been described as of great passion and determination by Quill and Quire in Canada, and vibrant, passionate and deeply moving, by the Canadian Bulletin of Medical History.
When young white British girl, Selena Jones, married Aidan Gilmor, a Eurasian immigrant from Sri Lanka in Toronto, she unwittingly enters a complex web of old British colonialism in Ceylon, later Sri Lanka, and an outmoded elite of tea planters that her irascible alcoholic father in law, Jack Gilmor, Cannot escape. As Selena faces prejudices in Toronto, before the era of Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeaus multiculturalism, she learns to become strong even as events move inexorably to a profound revelation of race and violence at the heart of Sri Lanka. Startlingly honest and humorous, Wheatley explores the subtle influence of colonialism on the psyches of her characters who find themselves caught on the wrong side of history.

Bureaucratic blunders
I refer to the statement by State Minister Range Bandara under title Government Officers shouldnt fear to perform duties.
He cited the imprisonment of Lalith Weeratunga and Anusah Pelpita. The issue however is quite different to what underlies his thinking. It is the interference by the MPs that has brought on the current situation where the public servants are waiting for political guidance before doing their duties. The MPs were elected as legislators never mind if they lacked the academic knowledge or background to do so. They were also expected to hold the Executive to accountability for good governance through the Legislature.
This was to be done through asking questions in Parliament including the criticism of the working of departments. But they were not to intervene directly in decision making of the departments. Their role and functions were a post- event examination and review of the actions of the executive arm of the government which included both the bureaucracy as well as the Ministers. But the Ministers were expected to take the responsibility for any faults or mistakes of the bureaucracy.
In 1956 we had the so-called Peoples Government or Ape AAnduwa where the newly elected SLFP MPs decided to directly intervene in the decision making process of the Administration in the name of the people and transformed the institution of a politically neutral administrative system to a politically driven public administration to favour themselves as the party which had obtained government power and represented the people.
Where previously the officials took no account of the political affiliation of the citizens in dispensing their services to the people and treated all the people equally irrespective of their political party affiliation; they were now called upon to show favour to those of the ruling political party and even discriminate against those who belong to or support the Opposition political parties.
Socialist Parties
This was the pattern in the Communist countries where the Communist Party became the monopoly political party. The Socialist Parties had however criticized the Communist Party monopoly on power and stood for a multi-party democracy. They recognized the importance of a politically neutral bureaucracy which was a feature of a liberal democracy as against the so-called mass democracy of the Communists where the Communist Party alone considered itself as the sole representative of the people and wanted to accord to the Party a special position and receive the favour of the Public Administrative Machinery.
So MPs visited government offices and demanded action on issues which were often controversial from the point of the public interest which alone should prevail. Other political parties were tolerated if they were minor parties but relegated to an insignificant role. Some were even subject to adverse discrimination as supposedly representing only the Capitalists.
But democracy continued to prevail and the Communists failed to gain power despite their volatile rhetoric against the so-called Capitalists except on the back of the Russian military as in Eastern Europe.
If we want to restore governance on a non-political basis which alone is conducive to good governance (the requirements for good governance are different from those for mass democracy under a single political party and this was recognized even by the Communist Party when they got power) then we need to allow for multi-party democracy.
Multi-party democracy
Here the bureaucracy has a key role to play to maintain multi-party democracy by not favouring the ruling political party at the expense of their opponents. The bureaucracy, must be politically neutral to maintain multi-party democracy. But the Communists refused to accept that the bureaucracy can ever be politically neutral. So they believed in a politically committed bureaucracy committed to Communism to satisfy their requirement for power. So they went for a party appointed bureaucracy.
But there are also certain essential requirements for the bureaucracy to deliver good governance and these include non-interference in their decision-making process by politicians. Decisions must be made on rational grounds free from political and other partisan considerations if all the people are to receive equal treatment. This is very necessary in a plural society. The decision makers in the bureaucracy must be free to make honest decisions in the public interest instead of the partisan political party interest. But the bureaucracy then needs to be protected from politicians whom they may antagonize when they seek favours and are refused by honest public officials acting in the general public interest.
So the issue of Lalith Weeratunga and party must be viewed in this light. It may be necessary to say no and incur the displeasure of the rulers and face even hardship. So their penalization reinforces the democratic requirement for government officials to act impartially and not get involved in promoting the governing political party. It is not easy to maintain an independent position since 1956 and particularly when dealing with the SLFP and its affiliates of the Left. I think a law is necessary debarring MPs from directly intervening in the work of the administration and to confine their responsibility to hold the Executive and the bureaucracy to account only through the Parliament.

Business networking session on expanding opportunities in the Russian market for SL spices and coconut products
The Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Russian Federation, in association with the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka, has completed yet another successful story during the month of September by organizing a Business Networking Session for the sectors of Coconut Products and Spices.
This is the third awareness programme in a series conducted by the Embassy since 2015 under the guidance of Dr. Saman Weerasinghe, Ambassador of Sri Lanka to Russia, who has been the driving force behind this whole process.
The first Networking Session was on the sea food sector in September 2015 and the second - on the Gem and Jewellery sector in May 2016.
The networking session was attended by more than 45 Russian importers, supermarket chain representatives and other interested parties. The companies attended the networking session from the Sri Lanka side were NMK Agro Industries, CBL Natural Foods, Abey Marin Pvt Ltd and Colombo Export and Import Agencies Pvt Ltd.
Two short video clips on coconut-based food products and spices were displayed during the session depicting the plantations, manufacturing process, health and other compliances and end products. The companies were given an opportunity to introduce their company products and the specific details of each product.
A Russian importer who was already aware of the uniqueness of the Sri Lankan spices described to the audience his experiences on these products, the clear distinction between cassia and cinnamon and the benefits of cinnamon over cassia.
The participants were given an information dossier, including an article on cinnamon indicating why the preference should be given to cinnamon, not cassia, the company profiles and the other contact details. A gift bag including the samples of spices, virgin coconut oil, confectionary and Ceylon tea was offered to the participants to feel the real quality of the Sri Lankan products.
The Sri Lankan participants found the networking sessions to be very effective, specially conducted by the Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Russian Federation, as Russia is a country that requires recognition and confidence of the companies to penetrate into the market. This was experienced during the period of introduction of seafood products to the Russian Federation which has gained successful results now.
This event was conducted parallel to the International Food and Beverages Exhibition World Food 2017 held in Moscow. This is the fourth time that Sri Lanka participated in the exhibition related to the food product sector other than the tea sector since 2015.
The World Food 2017 Exhibition wass held on September 11-14 at the Expocentre fair ground and more than 16 Sri Lankan companies representing sectors of Ceylon tea, spices, coconut products, confectionary and sea foods demonstrated their products. The foundation that the Embassy put in 2015 in diversifying the export product basket to the Russian market has now been built up into a successful story and the Government of Sri Lanka recognized this participation as a priority regular event for strengthening and maintaining the trade relations between the two countries.

CB Governor offers insights into Govts Vision 2025 at DFCC Bank workshop
DFCC Bank organized a strategizing session on September 9 at the Pegasus Reef Hotel, Wattala, where a cross-section of the Banks senior staff engaged in interactive and participatory discussions as well as focused strategy discussions for the Banks development in 2018-2020.
The highlights were the sessions conducted by two of the countrys financial leaders  Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and former Deputy Governor, Dr. W. A. Wijewardena, which focused on the macroeconomic development plans of the Government, as well as the long-term economic and financial sector growth of the country.
Dr. Coomaraswamy, in his address, detailed the Governments new Vision 2025 for the nation. The Central Bank Governor reiterated the Governments pledge of formulating a comprehensive economic strategy that will help raise per capita income to US$5,000 per year; create one million new jobs; increase foreign direct investment to US$5 billion per year; and double exports to US$20 billion per year. The main strategy to achieve this would be by making Sri Lanka a hub in Indian Ocean, and link it to external markets through exports.
He went on to explain that a new trade policy, along with an original National Export Strategy, will give rise to a more liberal, simple, transparent and predictable trade regime. Furthermore, he said that he hopes these policy changes will attract more export-oriented FDI, improve trade logistics and boost firms abilities to compete in global markets.
Earlier during the day, Dr. W. A. Wijewardena, former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank spoke about the Governments aim to improve Sri Lankas ranking in the Ease of Doing Business Index by undertaking essential economic reforms while ensuring policies are predictable, consistent and transparent. The good news for the private sector is that public private partnerships are to be used as a driver of economic growth.
Simultaneously there will be an emphasis on education and healthcare services across the country. The country as a whole will march towards a new dawn with the development of physical infrastructure facilities through the Megapolis project, economic corridors, improved transportation facilities, build-operate-transfer models and so on.
The key take away for DFCC Bank from both these sessions was that the Government has an ambitious vision to drive Sri Lanka to a high tech and digitalised economy while at the same time keeping focused on grassroots needs with plans to improve agriculture via productivity increases and by linking it to logistics networks.
These insightful sessions proved valuable for the DFCC Bank team during the workshop to focus on future strategy for growth, expansion and consolidation in the short-term as well as in the medium term.
At the end of the highly productive session, an ambitious plan for the growth of the Bank was formulated which the senior management is fully committed to implementing across the Bank. The broad plans were presented to the Board of Directors during a special session at the end of the programme.

CHANCELLOR Angela MERKEL DOES IT AGAIN
GERMANY: Chancellor Angela Merkel clinched a fourth term in Germanys election Sunday, but her victory was clouded by the entry into Parliament of the hard-right AfD in the best showing for a nationalist force since World War II.
Merkel, who after 12 years in power held a double-digit lead for most of the campaign, scored around 33 percent of the vote with her conservative Christian Union (CDU/CSU) bloc, according to preliminary results. It was their worst score since 1949.
Its nearest rivals, the Social Democrats and their candidate Martin Schulz, came in a distant second, with a post-war record low of 21 percent.
But in a bombshell for the German establishment, the anti-Islam, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) captured around 13 percent, catapulting it to become the countrys third biggest political force.
Commentators called the AfDs strong performance a watershed moment in the history of the German republic. The top-selling Bild daily spoke of a political earthquake.
AfD supporters gathered at a Berlin club, cheering as public television reported the outcome, many joining in a chorus of the German national anthem.
Hundreds of protesters rallied outside, shouting Nazis out! while smaller AfD demonstrations were held in other cities across the country.
The four-year-old nationalist party with links to the far-right French National Front and Britains UKIP has been shunned by Germanys mainstream but was able to build on particularly strong support in ex-communist eastern Germany.
It is now headed for the opposition benches of the Bundestag lower house, dramatically boosting its visibility and state financing.
Alarmed by the prospect of what Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded real Nazis entering parliament, the candidates had used their final days of campaigning to implore voters to reject the populists.
Turnout was markedly higher than four years ago, up to around 76 percent from 71.5 percent.
French President Emmanuel Macron was among the first to congratulate Merkel, promising that the two key European partners would keep up their essential cooperation.
Merkel admitted that she had fallen far short of the 40-percent goal her party set.
Theres a big new challenge for us, and that is the entry of the AfD in the Bundestag, said Merkel, adding: We want to win back AfD voters. Germans elected a splintered parliament, reflecting a nation torn between a relatively high degree of satisfaction with Merkel and a desire for change after more than a decade of her leadership.
Another three parties cleared the five-percent hurdle to be represented in parliament: the liberal Free Democrats at around 10 percent and the anti-capitalist Left and ecologist Greens, both at about nine percent.
As Merkel failed to secure a ruling majority on her own and with the dejected SPD ruling out another right-left grand coalition with her, the process of forming a viable government was shaping up to be a thorny, months-long process.
Merkel, 63, often called the most powerful woman on the global stage, ran on her record as a steady pair of hands in a turbulent world, warning voters not to indulge in experiments.
Pundits said Merkels reassuring message of stability and prosperity resonated in greying Germany, where more than half of the 61 million voters are aged 52 or older.
Her popularity had largely recovered from the influx since 2015 of more than one million mostly Muslim migrants and refugees, half of them from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
But the AfD was able to capitalise on anger over the asylum issue during what was criticised as a largely lacklustre campaign bereft of real clashes among the main contenders.
The party has made breaking taboos its trademark.
Top AfD candidate Alexander Gauland has called for Germans to shed their guilt over two world wars and the Holocaust and to take pride in their veterans.
He has also suggested that Germanys integration commissioner Aydan Ozoguz, who has Turkish roots, should be disposed of in Anatolia.
The SPD said its catastrophic result would lead it to seek a stint in opposition to rekindle its fighting spirit.
This is a difficult and bitter day for German social democracy, a grim-faced Schulz, a former European Parliament chief, told reporters, adding that he hoped to remain party leader.
This would leave Merkel in need of new coalition partners. - AFP

Childrens Day celebrations at The Sooriya Village
The Sooriya Village, in line with the spirit of Childrens Day, is hosting a festival in their own aesthetic by bringing drama, stories, and music on October 1 from 4 pm to 7.30 pm.
The Sooriya Village has partnered up with Somalatha Subasinghe Play House with their session of Tellers and Listeners, Sulochana Dissanayake of Power of Play who will be bringing us Labu Gediye Thowilaya, and Larry T Hill who is no less than a magician with his simple set up of a mic and a Loop Pedal.
The first act by the Somalatha Subasinghe Playhouse is on Storytelling which is a method used to pass on visions, values, feelings, and memories of generations to the young ones in words. Storytelling is a powerful method of educating children on an array of subjects. Somalatha Subasinghe Play House, since its inception, has been trying to educate children on basic art forms through the medium of theatre. Hence the storytelling by the actors of Play House use words, movements, music and dramatic scenes to enhance artistic taste, cheerfulness and playful sense of the child through aesthetic experiences. (Performance time: 4 to 5pm)
With a striking solo performance, Larry T Hill crafts cheeky musical tales using just voice and a looping pedal. He records layer upon layer of his voice live on stage, creating elaborate yet fun musical pieces which you might expect to hear from a small band. Performances can be energetic and animated, soulful and outrageous, witty, pretty or sometimes just silly. The sharp beats, deep bass lines, and sweet harmonies will have you hooked, singing the tunes all the way home. (Performance time: 5.15 to 6.15pm)
Labu Gediye Thowilaya by Power of Play is a folktale where a whole Thowiyala was held inside a magical gourd. It is brought to life by low country dancers, live music, and fire dancing.
The act will tickle the children funny and amuse the child in all of us adults. The performance will be in English and Sinhala and will run approximately for 60 minutes. (Performance time: 6.30 to 7.30pm)
International Childrens day first came into existence in 1925 in Geneva, in order to draw attention to issues specific to Children. It was the Soviet Union who called attention to the need for a day specific to Children. Different countries celebrate this day on different days and in Sri Lanka, we choose to celebrate it on October 1 each year.
In 2012, the United Nations led the initiative for the education of Children. To enable attendance of school for all children, to promote peace, respect and environmental concern were some of their goals. On Childrens day, the focus is on bringing awareness to the millions of children in child labor, misplaced due to wars and armed conflict, child abuse and exploitation and discrimination because of religious, minority issues or disabilities.
Children equals hope, and in their growing young minds, the keys to solving the issues that plague us today. Their outlook on life in general, their penchant for curiosity makes them thinkers, makers, leaders.

China Merchant Ports Holdings is looking at tying up with Sinopec or China Petroleum to have a bunkering facility at the Hambantota Port which is now managed by the company on a lease agreement.
In addition, infrastructure investments the tune of US$ 600 million would be pumped into the Southern port by CM Port.
These came to light at a special South Asias Emerging Gateway City  Hambantota Port event organized by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, last Friday in Colombo. Hang Tian, Deputy General Manager, China Merchant Port Holdings Company Ltd, said that they will start projects at the Southern Harbour form November. We will also get local stakeholders involved in these projects as well as we feel Sri Lanka too should benefit.
Mangala Yapa, Managing Director, Agency for Development Strategies, said that two Chinese companies had put forward a joint venture proposal for the proposed oil refinery, which is expected to produce 5 million tonnes per annum with an investment between US$2.5 billion and US$3 billion.
The investment is large and we are discussing with the two companies on that basis, he said, adding that the joint venture plan was chosen from three bids including one from a US company through a local partner.
Hambantota Port, overlooking the Indian Ocean, is expected to play a key role in Chinas One Belt, One Road initiative, otherwise known as the New Silk Road, which will link ports and roads between China and Europe. (SS)

China disrupts WhatsApp ahead of Communist Party meeting

The messaging service WhatsApp has been disrupted in China as the government steps up security ahead of a Communist Party meeting next month.
Users have faced problems with the app for more than a week with services dropping in and out.
At times, it has been completely blocked and only accessible via virtual private networks which circumvent China's internet firewall.
WhatsApp is Facebook's only product allowed to operate in mainland China.
Facebook's main social media service and its Instagram image sharing app are not available on the mainland.
The BBC's China based correspondents said the WhatsApp messaging service started going offline more than a week ago.
A test of its services on Tuesday showed users in China could not send video messages or photographs to people outside China.
The disruption follows restrictions on WhatsAppvideo chats and photographsin July, which were later lifted.
The tightening of online censorship comes as China steps up security ahead of the Communist Party's national congress which is held every five years.
"The run-up period to a gathering is a normally a time of greater restrictions of all kinds to assure that the critical Party Congress is held under ideal social conditions and is not disrupted", Robert Lawrence Kuhn, long-time advisor to China's leaders and multinational corporations told the BBC.
However, he said it is not yet clear whether the restrictions will be relaxed as has happened after previous party congresses, adding that many analysts do not believe they will be.
Cyber security experts said WhatsApp most likely came under the attention of China's censors because it has a strong reputation for security.
The app provides end-to-end encryption which ensures only the sender and recipient can view the content of messages.
It also prevents Facebook from knowing what is said in any text, voice and video conversation being communicated on WhatsApp.
"China has shown little tolerance to encryption especially on platforms that can be used to share materials or potential propaganda," Bill Taylor-Mountford, Asia Pacific vice president for LogRhythm told the BBC.
The latest disruption to WhatsApp appears to be part of a broader crackdown on the internet and online content in China.
On Monday, China's cyber watchdog handed down maximum penalties to some of the country's top technology firms including Tencent, Baidu and Weibo for failing to properly censor online content.
The penalties were imposed for failing to remove fake news and pornography, as well as content that authorities said "incites ethic tension" and "threatens social order".

Chinese brands outstrip rivals in market share
Chinese automakers are gaining an increasingly larger market share of their home market, but industry insiders said they should not be overly optimistic as there is still a long way to go.
More than 6.38 million China-branded passenger cars were sold from January to August, 4.8 percent growth year-on-year. That's more than double the growth rate of the passenger car sector as a whole, according to statistics from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.
Chinese brands seized 43.2 percent of the market share in the period, far higher than the runner-up, as German carmakers products accounted for 20.5 percent of the market.
Yang Xueliang, vice-president of Geely Group, believes the upward trend will go further.
If the momentum continues, Chinese brands are likely to have a 50 percent or even 60 percent market share in the long run, Yang said at a Chinese brands-themed automotive forum in Shandong province last week.
Geely is one of the fastest-growing Chinese automakers in China. In the first eight months this year, it sold 718,000 new cars, surging 88 percent year-on-year.
Geely now owns Swedish brand Volvo and Malaysia's Proton, and has unveiled its own brand Lynk & Co, aiming to compete with international brands such as GM and Volkswagen.
At Changan Automobile, which has partnerships with Ford, Suzuki and Mazda, the international brand cars accounted for roughly 45 percent of the group's total sales last year, according to Li Wei, its vice-president.
Our Changan-branded cars took 55 percent. Our own brand is rising within the group, so we feel that Chinese brands as a whole are full of hope too.
Wang Xia, chairman of the Automotive Industry Committee of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said Chinese brands have seized the opportunity and realized rapid growth, but they should not be complacent about what they have achieved. Instead, they should prepare for a tug of war with international brands over a long period of time, he said.
Wang was echoed by Lu Qun, chairman of Qiantu Motor, an electric carmaker. Lu said he believes that Chinese brands could even raise their market share to 50 percent, but there is a long way to go before really getting established.
How do we make our brands more attractive How do we offer customers good value for money And how do we offer them better experiences We need to find out answers to those questions, Lu said.
Zhang Xiyong, general manager of BAIC Group, said Chinese carmakers still lag behind international big names in the industry in terms of quality and other competitive factors.
He said there were six automotive companies in the list of the 2016 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands but none of them were Chinese.
Zhang suggested that Chinese companies should try to go global if they want to become global brands.
China sold 800,000 cars overseas last year, a meager 3 percent of what it sold in the domestic market.
As the Belt and Road Initiative has become widely accepted, there is huge potential overseas, said Zhang.
However, he suggested that in China, Chinese automakers should shift their focus from large cities to smaller ones, as people there are becoming major consumer groups.
Xiang Xingchu, general manager of JAC Motors, said Chinese companies should each create their own individual features to appeal to their target customers.
It is not possible to sell your cars to everyone. Find your target customers and they will be large enough, said Xiang. Some say their cars are sporty, some say they excel in safety and some others say they offer premium cars. But aren't premium cars safe Yes they are. But as a company you have to map out a different route of development. (Chinadaily)

"I grew up listening to Christina Aguilera. She was one of my idols growing up. She still is. Her voice is incredible, and in 'Stripped', you really got to hear that. I think it was her breakout album that really transformed her into the icon that she is today.
"So that inspired me... She really inspired this album. I was even inspired by the black and white artwork!" Lovato said. PTI

Guinness-worth record
The recent bail granted to two convicts of the same crime within hardly three weeks of the sentence, became a hilarious joke in society with some quipping it to be the latest Guinness Book entry.
It is a common phenomenon for the convicts to apply for bail on medical grounds. Despite whatever the crime they have committed, these Very Important criminals suddenly find themselves in need of medication at the time of the sentence. They expect VIP medical treatment that they had been used to. They need specialists at their beck and call. They would conveniently forget that the overseas medical treatment and check-ups come at state expense. And worse still is when they forget the current day agony that the genuine patients are undergoing. Once released we see these convicts and accused travelling around the country as well as internationally and addressing public meetings with vim, vigour and vitality and other social functions.
In the eyes of the general public once could see the bluff that is exposed by these characters. A good idea would be for Court authorities to call for a 6 months medical report of the accused to be presented to Court when the case is initially called with follow-up instructions to the JMO till the conclusion of the case.

Compassion and the 2nd Class Compartment..!
Rohingya are illegal immigrants! roared the Indian Home Minister from his perch in New Delhi. Most probably an air-conditioned room or hall, and to the applause of those present!
He must have smiled seeing the effect on the crowd, but Im sure he didnt see something else:
He didnt see a distraught woman, one of many, trying to clamber onto a boat with a baby on each arm, slipping in her haste and falling into the water, then again making another attempt even as the boatman held up his open palm for the fare that would wipe out all her savings!
He didnt see men, limp with exhaustion, their hair matted with blood not just from bush and branch they had scurried through but from bullet and bayonet that had fired at their fleeing bodies, which tired and worn, now looked for something that would nourish and get some strength back.
He didnt see children, yes boys and girls three and four years old wandering aimlessly looking for parents, who lay somewhere with lifeless eyes, not able to see those babies anymore; shot, burned or raped by soldiers who cared nothing for them.
I am sure the good home minister saw none of this as he sat in his airconditioned hall, and heard the applause from others also sitting in same comfort.
In Mumbai, there are many beggars who clamber into the suburban trains and beg. None climb into the first-class compartment, they all prefer begging in the lower, second class. Watch what happens; as the beggar goes from seat to seat, poor people, with maybe an income just above that of the poor beggar, pull out worn leather wallets, or fish in their pockets for a few notes and give it to the poor fellow.
This doesnt ever happen in the first class compartment, where potbellied men sit with wallets crammed with high denomination notes, with eyes that would have looked with disdain at the poor fellow had he ventured into their holy, exclusive domain.
Compassion, strangely exists in the second class compartment!
I remember a poorer India, allowing millions of Bangladeshi refugees in the early seventies, as they escaped from an army that was terrorizing them.
It burdened our people. It nosedived our economy, but gritting our teeth we allowed them in.
Today, we sit in the first-class compartment. Weve forgotten what it is to be just one level above the man who begs. Sir! they shout, as they try to enter India, We are hungry. We are persecuted. Give us compassion!
Get out! we shout, Dont soil our seats, dont spoil our peace, this is a first-class compartment!
Compassion, speaks volumes, not just about the class you travel, but the effect the religion we follow has on us..!

Court rejects SLFP Deputy Chairmans request to intervene in Geethas appeal case
The five judge bench headed by Chief Justice Priyasath Dep yesterday rejected the request by SLFP Deputy Chairman Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to intervene in the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe challenging the Court of Appeal judgement.
The Court of Appeal had issued an order in the nature of a writ of Quo Warranto declaring that Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The two-Judge-Bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Vijith Malalgoda and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena observed that in terms of Article 91(1) (d) (xiii), the first respondent, Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds duel citizenship of both Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
The court noted that permission has been given to Ihala Megagama Gamage Piyasena to intervene in the case and another party can not be allowed to intervene when the case is being heard.
Senior lawyer Ali Sabry PC appearing for Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena made a request that his client wanted to intervene in the appeal filed by Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe.
The petition was taken up before five judge bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and justices Buwaneka Aluvihare, Sisira de Abrew, Anil Gooneratne and Nalin Perera.
Senior Lawyer JC Weliamuna appearing for the respondents objected the request. He told court that such a request cannot be allowed as the petition is fixed for hearing.

"I'm already working on the next one. I'm already two songs deep on the next one. I'm over this now. I want to figure out what I want to do next. Hopefully I can take some time - chill with the dogs, hand with the pigs a little bit more, take some time off. But just keep writing," Cyrus told in a radio show.

Eurozone sees burst of activity in September
The eurozone economy ended the third quarter of the year on a strong note, a survey has indicated.
The IHS Markit composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) suggested private businesses grew faster than expected in September.
It said manufacturers had enjoyed their best month since early 2011.
Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: "The eurozone economy ended the summer with a burst of activity." Business activity during September saw one of its strongest gains for the past six years, the survey indicated. The "flash" PMI reading for September - which is based on about 85% of replies to the survey - rose to 56.7 from August's reading of 55.7. A reading above 50 indicates growth.
The manufacturing sector saw the biggest rise in employment in more than two decades, IHS Markit said, adding that the signs were that the next quarter would register strong manufacturing growth as well.
The survey also found that the pick-up in business activity had been accompanied by rising price pressures, with input cost and selling price inflation accelerating for the second month in a row.
It pointed out that the rise in business activity and inflationary pressures would fuel expectations the European Central Bank will, as has long been awaited, start to rein in its asset purchase programme.
The ECB is currently buying 60bn euros (55bn) of bonds a month as part of its quantitative easing programme.
Earlier this month, the ECB raised its eurozone economic growth forecast for this year to 2.2%, the fastest in 10 years and hinted it could start trimming asset purchases next month. (BBC)

Evoking pain and passion
Some say there is a reason for everything. And there is reason why Roshan Jayakody is on this earth. By profession he is an IT engineer working in Europe  France and UK. Jayakody is here to evoke emotion in his audience. He is here to bring us into contact with our innermost desire and our innermost fears. Why would a man of computers be interested in music It can only be this passion he has to give some meaning to the chaotic life that we all live in. Melodies talks to Roshan Jayakody who needs to make other people feel what he is feeling.
I have released two CDs on August 26. One CD is called Supun Sandak Paaya Bodu Bathi Gee which has about 16 tracks, all of which are Buddhist devotional songs and the second one is a semi classic also with around 16 songs called Neela Nayana.
If you take the tracks on Neela Nayana it touches on themes of family and love. There is a track 13 on Neela Nayana, where it talks about the importance of having a good wife who will take care of the children. Track 14 talks about the transient nature of life and the final inevitable outcome which is death. In which one becomes just a memory, explains Jayakody.
Jayakody does not desire fame. He only wants to make other people feel his pain and his passion. He wants to share how he sees life with others. He wants his music to appeal to people because music is the medium he uses to communicate his vision. It is how he communicates his perception of life to his fans.
I am not planning to be famous artist in the future. My idea is to give out high quality creations to society. When I select songs I always consider the lyrics and the meaning it brings out. I also pay a lot of attention to the way they have put the words together. For Bodu Bathi Gee, I have composed all the music  the melodies. Some of the songs are written by me as well. Tharindu Jayathilake composed the music tracks for all of these, said Jayakody.
In Neela Nayana features many famous names who composed the music for Jayakody. Some of the songs were written by Jayakody as well. So it is a mix of professional and novice artistes. Jayakody says that a lot of people have put very high quality lyrics on FB, and dont really know it will become a song one day.
Jayakody makes you think when you listen to his lyrics.
What you do for others might have little significance to you but it means a lot for that person. For example his song about mothers has received very positive feedback. Jayakodys underlying theme is love. When he sings about death he sings about the pain one experiences when having lost a loved one.
When I chose the lyrics they were really surprised and grateful. Most of the songs have gained much acceptance and love by my fans. One track 16, is an appreciation of the country we live in which was actually written by a Muslim girl. She has written a few songs for me. The talent she has is really marvelous and her name is Shamila Hussain. Some songs have evoked emotions of pathos within people. They have called me up saying the songs have reminded them of their mothers, saying the songs are sad but beautiful, pointed out Jayakody.
Jayakodys journey in music started at a very young age. At the age of three he began to show an ability to reach out to others. He started to show a certain way of tapping into the way others felt and started to experience so many emotions.
Music is in me, and I started showing signs of promise at the age of three. Then I learnt to play the Piano on my own. I started to study Hindustani music while at school. I really dedicated myself to studying these Indian forms of classical music and then I went to Europe. I studied Classical Music as well in Europe. So I plan on putting out some more creations in the near future, said Jayakody.
People really know of him through word of mouth. Even though his career is in IT, music is his driving force. He also expressed a desire to do what he can for the music industry in Sri Lanka
Last year, February 10, I recorded/ voiced 63 songs in one day. I consider that quite an achievement. Some of them are in my CDs. I am also working on some more songs which I find exciting. Now my themes are becoming more complicated with deeper meaning. I am very selective now, added Jayakody.
His endeavors have been well received. This is because he genuinely loves his music.
This is not a very commercial venture for me at all. I just want to give something back to society for what I have received from life. For the CD release, I had a big concert and on the same day I released the CD, stated Jayakody.
Performance wise and music wise the concert was a success, but the crowd turnout was quite moderate. Apart from FB and YouTube, he does not have much of a local crowd. But has a considerable following on FB and YouTube.

Facebooks Zuckerberg drops controversial stock plan
Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has abandoned plans to create a new class of company stock.
A group of investors had sued over the proposal, which would have allowed Zuckerberg to retain voting control of Facebook but own a smaller share of the company's shares.
Zuckerberg still plans to sell up to $12bn (9bn) of Facebook shares to fund philanthropic ventures.
He would potentially have appeared in court next week as part of the lawsuit.
Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook that when he proposed the stock split, he viewed it as the "only way" to fund those ventures, while maintaining control of Facebook.
But he said the share price had increased so much that he no longer saw it as necessary.
The proposed structure is popular with founders of firms such as Google's parent company Alphabet, but other shareholders view it as unfair.
"Over the past year and a half, Facebook's business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more," Zuckerberg wrote.
"As a result, I've asked our board to withdraw the proposal to reclassify our stock - and the board has agreed."
Zuckerberg said he plans to sell 35 million to 75 million shares - worth up to $12bn at current prices - over the next 18 months to fund his family's philanthropic work.
Investors, including pension funds, had alleged that Facebook's board breached its duty to represent shareholders when they approved the plan.
Stuart Grant of Grant & Eisenhofer, an attorney for shareholders, called the decision a "total victory". He said the case was now expected to be dismissed.
"We're thrilled that Facebook has dropped the reclassification," Grant said.
Facebook has been grappling with controversy stemming from fake news spread through its network, as well as calls for increased regulator action.

Federer leads Europe to maiden Laver Cup title
Prague: World number two Roger Federer handed Team Europe the maiden Laver Cup title after beating Team World's Nick Kyrgios in a super tie-break thriller in Prague on Sunday.
Federer, this year's Australian Open and Wimbledon champion, won 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), 11/9 to give Team Europe an unbeatable 15-9 lead.
But the 36-year-old Swiss legend struggled against the 20th-ranked, 22-year-old Australian and his flawless serve, losing the first set on a single break.
When he finally broke Kyrgios halfway through set two, he yelled "Come on!" in relief, only to lose his serve again in the next game.
But Federer capitalised on the system of the tournament he had founded -- forcing Kyrgios into longer exchanges, he edged him in the second-set tie-break, then came back from 8-5 down in the decisive super tie-break.
"I kind of felt good going into the breaker," Federer said.
"It was a nail-biter at the end but for me personally it was a dream scenario."
"It was an incredible journey really, it was way better than I ever thought it would be," he added about the tournament.
"It felt like winning some of the biggest matches in my life. It was like a fairy tale."
Kyrgios said the loss "just hurt."
"I gave everything I had and I came short."
The start of the clash saw the controversial Kyrgios briefly kneel on the court in a gesture which sparked speculation that he was joining the ongoing protest against US President Donald Trump.
But Kyrgios explained this was his trademark gesture to "remember the two most important people that have passed away" -- a reference to his late grandmother and grandfather.
A host of NFL players chose to kneel in games across the US on Sunday during the playing of American national anthem in a demonstration against racial inequality.
Team Europe, the odds-on favourites with five of the world's top seven players, entered Sunday with a 9-3 lead which narrowed as Jack Sock and John Isner beat Tomas Berdych and Marin Cilic in the opening doubles rubber.
On Sunday, the winner of each rubber earned three points, against one on Friday and two on Saturday.
Alexander Zverev then took Europe within sight of the trophy by beating Sam Querrey in straight sets, but world number one Rafael Nadal missed his chance as he lost to big-serving John Isner in straight sets.
Sock and Isner beat Berdych and Cilic 7-6 (7/5), 7-6 (8/6) with Sock's vicious forehand leading the charge on the American's 25th birthday.
In the day's second rubber, a break in each set was all German youngster Zverev, the world number four, needed to beat 16th-ranked American Querrey 6-4, 6-4 in their first-ever encounter.
Isner's greatest moment was yet to come as the world number 17 edged Nadal, this year's French and US Open champion.
Nadal lost his serve in game one with a double-fault before Isner's errors helped him draw level in game ten, but Isner broke back at once and finished the set with the help of two second-serve aces in the last game. He then swept Nadal in the second-set tie-break after both held on to their serves. "We were lucky to be 9-3 before today," said Nadal. "We are very happy to win the first Laver Cup for Europe. Let's enjoy this moment."
Skippered by Bjorn Borg, Team Europe also comprised Dominic Thiem, while Frances Tiafoe and Denis Shapovalov played for John McEnroe's Team World earlier in the tournament.The organisers said Sunday Chicago would host the next edition of the Laver Cup on September 21-23, 2018. AFP

Fitch affirms Abans at BBB+(lka);  Outlook stable
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based retailer Abans PLCs (Abans) National Long-Term Rating at BBB+(lka) with a Stable outlook.
Fitch has also withdrawn the expected rating assigned to Abans proposed senior unsecured debentures as the debt issuance is no longer expected to convert to final ratings in the near future. A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary.
The affirmation of Abans ratings reflects our view that the recent weakening in its leverage is temporary, and that the company will be able to deleverage in the next 12-18 months, underpinned by a recovery in sales across a number of its product segments this year.
Abans ratings also reflect its strong market position in consumer durable retailing in Sri Lanka, its extensive brand portfolio and wide distribution network compared with most peers. We expect Abans net leverage (defined as lease adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR) to improve to 6.0x by the end of the financial year to March 2019 (FY19) from 7.7x in FYE17.

The government will bring in a permanent price index to control the price of coconuts after several black marketeers have been caught selling coconuts at exorbitant rates, a local media report said on Monday.
The Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairman Kapila Yakandawala said the price index would be announced shortly owing to the prevailing high prices for coconuts in the retail market.
He added that a coconut should be priced between 70 Sri Lankan rupees (0.45 U.S. dollars) and 75 rupees but black market vendors were selling at high prices.
Coconut is one of the major plantation crops in Sri Lanka which accounts for approximately 12 percent of all agricultural produce in Sri Lanka.

Hanks to produce and star in A Man Called Ove
After The Da Vinci Code, Angels & Demons and Inferno, Tom Hanks is all set to tackle an adaptation of another international best-selling novel A Man Called Ove.
According to a report, Hanks is attached to star in the project and will produce with his Playtone banner partner Gary Goetzman.
Rita Wilson, Hanks wife and frequent producing partner, is also producing along with Fredrik Wikstrom Nicastro.
The 2012 book by Fredrik Backman told the tale of a cantankerous widower who seems to revel in his bitterness and loneliness even as his frequent suicide attempts seem to be thwarted by bad timing and bad luck.
His life, however, takes a turn toward the unexpected when a mixed-race couple, with two young daughters, move into the neighborhood, leading to a heartwarming and life-affirming friendship.
The book became the best-seller and remained on the top of the list for a consecutive 77 weeks. It has been translated into 43 languages. ANI

Hoops, rings and body piercing things!
Every day, across the world men and women, boys and girls, get themselves tattooed and pierced. And its not just their ears or noses. They are participating in the modern fad of Body Art, which has its origins in antiquity, but which in recent decades has developed into some extreme forms that are often quite disturbing.
Many seem to be making a sad cry for attention that they would not receive otherwise and I confess that I draw inferences about their neediness, their judgment, and their impulsiveness. Just imagine, some of these bizarre body mutilating fiascos that include horns, forked tongues, elf ears and feline whiskers. No, these arent features from the latest fantasy film.
Today, thousands of people are getting their bodies customized in all sorts of wacky and unusual ways. Tattoos are just the tip of the iceberg for people interested in body modification, referred to as body mutilation by detractors.
The only time I wore an earring was when I acted in a school play as Sinbad the Sailor when I was seven or thereabouts. It was a large sort of gypsy hoop which interfered with my swashbuckling performance. Fortunately it was a clip-on thing so I was spared the horror of having my ear punctured.
But there is a kind of moral ring to the story and a piercing one at that. A jealous class-mate, nicknamed The Ouch Grouch, who was given an insignificant role in the cast as a running brigand began imitating my performance much to the amusement of our mates. He kept prancing around like an idiot on a pogo-stick with a foot-ruler for a sword and revelled in the mirth he caused. But one day he went too far.
To provide a more authentic flavour to his lampooning act he attempted to devise an earring with a key-ring. He stretched it as much as he could and just as he was about to clip it on his ear lobe a pointed end went clean through it. It bled like a scarlet spigot and the hapless nurse in the school medical room could not remove it.
He was rushed, screaming in agony all the way, to hospital where it was reportedly snapped with the aid of a wire-cutter. Naturally he was conferred with the nickname Key-Ring Kanaya which he still carries. Yes Siree, retribution in this case certainly had a piercing ring of poetic justice to it!
The reasons for piercing are wide-ranging. Some pierce for religious or spiritual reasons. For instance, closer home in the holy town of Kataragama Hindu devotees puncture various parts of the face and body with miniature spears representing the weapon of the war god Murugan. While others perforate for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for ahem, erotic pleasure, to conform to their culture or to rebel against it.
Extreme body modification procedures are almost never performed by actual physicians. These treatments are more often associated with tattoo parlours than medical offices. In fact, Ive never heard of a single plastic surgeon who admitted to performing extreme body modification. And because actual doctors arent involved, the patients dont benefit from modern anaesthetics.
Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to unmentionable parts of their anatomy. Seems to me the amount of metal stuck in them is in inverse proportion to their intelligence. Body piercings are all the rage these days, but people are forever inventing new places to put the little pieces of art. I can just imagine what the parent of some of the kids had to say when they got home with their new piercing; You pierced your what
Look at the range of them, eyebrow hoops, tongue barbells, nose and lip studs and navel rings are among the ones considered more conservative. But who would in their right mind would want to have holes punched in them to accommodate these anatomical accessories.
Pains me to admit it but I am darned scared of any form of piercings. You see, I dont want anything dangling off any part of me that is held in place by a tiny piece of flesh. Snag it on something and its goodbye to whatever part of your frame it is affixed to.
For many, it is a personal articulation of unanimity with a social cause, a trend that attracts predominately young people, driving them to ever wilder and more shocking appearances of personal disfigurement. These include total-body tattoos, pierced eyelids, lips, noses, tongues, foreheads, and even disfigurement of their, well, lets say doodahs of reproduction, in a never-ending quest for the most outrageous form of self-expression through this type of agonizing body ornamentation.
As for piercings some of them are distressingly located in totally unspeakable parts of the subjects anatomies. Ouch! And as any mortified Sri Lankan matriarch would exclaim: Cheekay, Cheekay! Which in Anglicised parlance would translate to yukky and double yukky.
Experience will soon teach them to steer clear of some inviting clear freshwater pools inhabited with the omnivorous kaviyya fish which fancy taking painful nips at your fingers, toes or any other tempting visible appendages they mistake for a meal. One suspects soon enough that these denizens of the invigorating pools are closely related to the Piranhas of the South American rivers.
I do not contend that the schools of shoaling Kavaiyyas pecking at your pinkies or any other vital part of your anatomy could cause as serious damage as their South American counterparts. Yet their nips are excruciatingly unpleasant to say the least.
Nonetheless no one would want to wade in to their territory seeking a free manicure or pedicure, unless they fancy an attempted type of initiatory rite of circumcision in the process. Worse, one has also to watch out for mud crabs which could sink their murderous sharp claws into anything they perceive as a temptingly dangling morsel to latch onto.
They are the nightmare of all skinny-dippers because when they clamp their claws into your fingers or toes or that unmentionable adjunct of ones manhood they refuse obdurately to release their hold even if you snap the claw from their body.
Besides, many of these body piercing accessories with their rings and hoops resemble genuine fishing lures. So it would not be prudent particularly for those with a penchant for navel or loin hoops and rings to indulge in diversions such as skinny dipping. They say its good clean holesome fun. It might be the type of deterrent to make them lose their holier-than-thou attitude for good. And of course they will be fishing for trouble. Because there will always be the painful prospect of making them feel less cock-a-hoop, with the denizens of the deep running hoops and rings around their lower extremities. [emailprotected]

Hundred hero Ali presses the button in England six-fest
BRISTOL Sept 25: Moeen Ali said his six-laden one-day international century against West Indies at Bristol was simply a matter of deciding to press the button and play a few shots.
Ali struck England's second-fastest ODI hundred off just 53 balls, with his second fifty coming in a world record 12 deliveries.
His 102 was the cornerstone of a total of 369 for nine -- England's highest in ODIs against West Indies.
Despite an impressive 94 from the returning Chris Gayle, it proved too much for the visitors to chase with England winning by the commanding margin of 124 runs on Sunday to go 2-0 up with two to play in this five-match series.
Once Gayle was run out by Adil Rashid, West Indies' innings fell away with England fast bowler Liam Plunkett taking five for 52 -- his maiden ODI five-for -- as the tourists were dismissed for 245 with a whopping 65 balls, or more than 10 overs, to spare.
Ali hit eight sixes and Gayle six in a match featuring 28 in total, with both left-handed batsmen taking advantage of the short straight boundaries at southwest county Gloucestershire's headquarters.
I just had a slog really, and everything just seemed to come off, all-rounder Ali, known for being an elegant stroke-player, told reporters.
I thought we'd got ourselves in, and it was time to press the button and play a few shots -- it's not a massive hit for six (here). West Indies, who've now lost 14 of their last 15 completed ODIs against England, actually started impressively with the ball to restrict the home side to just 18 runs off the first five overs.
We just didn't finish off well, said a rueful West Indies captain Jason Holder, who won the toss and fielded.
They (England) bat deep. He (Ali) has played a special innings. I think we didn't execute our plans towards him.
It's a small ground and he backed himself to clear it. One consolation for West Indies was the innings of Gayle, long one of the world's leading limited-overs batsmen.
He had marked his 38th birthday on Thursday by injuring his hamstring just before the toss while warming up and so missing a rainswept no-result in the second ODI at Trent Bridge.
- 'Surprising' Gayle -
But the Jamaica opener was near his blistering best in Bristol.
It was very special, said Holder of the veteran's 78-ball innings, which also featured nine fours.
Not only did he get the start we wanted, he carried on and batted into the innings.
That was important, the longer he stays out there, the more England fear (losing). Meanwhile Holder insisted there was a far more thoughtful side to Gayle than might be apparent from a player who revels in a 'cool' image with the self-created nickname of the 'Universe Boss'.
Chris is always a relaxed guy but, if you go to him, you'd be surprised by the amount of information you get from him, said Holder.
I've been privy to having a few chats with him in the last couple of days and it's been wonderful. This series has seen Gayle return to ODIs after a two-year dispute with Caribbean cricket chiefs and Barbados all-rounder Holder added: He's shared a lot of information and helped me out a lot on the field.
It's really good to have a guy like him playing for you. Hopefully his body will allow to him carry on a lot longer. Holder was adamant that West Indies, the World Twenty20 champions, were not too far off becoming a competitive side in the 50-over game. We just need to knuckle down a little more, especially when we bat, he explained ahead of Wednesday's fourth ODI at The Oval in London.
'Death' bowling has obviously been a cause for concern in the recent past and we really need to tighten up there as well. AFP

ICRA Lanka assigns issuer rating of [SL]BBB- with stable outlook to Alliance Finance
ICRA Lanka Limited, subsidiary of ICRA Limited, group company of Moodys Investors Service, has assigned the issuer rating of [SL]BBB- (pronounced SL triple B minus) with a stable outlook to Alliance Finance Company PLC (AFCP or the Company). ICRA Lanka has also assigned the issue rating of [SL]BBB- (pronounced SL triple B minus) with a stable outlook to the Rs 1,000 Mn Senior Unsecured Redeemable debentures programme of the Company, currently listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
ICRA Lanka has also assigned issue ratings of [SL]BB+ (pronounced SL double B plus) with stable outlook to the Rs 480.17 Mn Subordinated Unsecured Redeemable Debentures programme and the Rs 613.14 Mn Subordinated Unsecured Redeemable Debentures programme of the company currently listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange.
The ratings factor in the established track record of the company in the financing business, a fairly diversified lending portfolio, comfortable asset quality and a fairly diversified funding profile.
The ratings are however constrained by its high gearing and moderate profitability indicators.
The ratings take note of the strict Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for vehicle financing, which is expected to increase competitive pressure and impact business growth and margin expansion for the players including AFCP. ICRA Lanka takes note of the companys initiative to diversify its portfolio, which could reduce the share of vehicle financing going forward from current levels; however, ability to grow at an optimal pace in the new target segments, namely, mortgage loans and business loans, etc., without impacting its asset quality and generating good risk adjusted returns would be critical.
AFCP is one of the older finance companies in Sri Lanka with a track record of more than 60 years. The company has presence in 89 locations (39 branches, 21 microfinance service locations, 12 gold loan centers and 17 collection centers) covering all 25 districts of the country.
The companys key products are leasing, which accounts for 67% of the total portfolio as on June 30, 2017, followed by loans (23%), micro finance (7%,) gold loans/pawning (2%) and hire purchase (1%). In terms of asset classes, three-wheeler financing (21%), car financing (18%), lorry financing (12%), mortgage loans (9%) and van financing (8%) were the key constituents of AFCPs portfolio.
The other key asset classes include micro finance (group lending), equipment financing, two-wheeler financing, which account for 13% of the portfolio. ICRA Lanka notes that the portfolio growth is expected to remain at about 20-25% over the near to medium term with focus on four-wheeler financing.
The companys gross NPA ratio increased to 17.4% on March 31, 2014, from 2.2% on March 31, 2013 because of the stress on its pawning exposures. The same however improved over FY2015 and FY2016, largely on account of the large write-offs and recoveries made during the period.
As on March 31, 2017, the company reported a gross NPA of 2.1% and a net NPA of 0.8%when compared to gross NPA of 2.5% and net NPA of 0.7% in March 2016. The gross and net NPA stood at 2.6% and 1.3% as on June 30, 2017.
ICRA Lanka notes that while the asset quality indicators are comfortable presently, ability to control incremental slippages, especially in the target business segments for growth, would be a key monitorable. The ratings nevertheless take note of the strengthening in the companys management team and internal control process and systems, which provide some comfort.
AFCP has a fairly diversified funding profile comprising retail fixed deposits, debentures and term loans from banks.
As on June 30, 2017, around 42% of the companys funding was from deposits, while the balance was through debentures and bank loans. Going forward, the company is expecting to maintain a 45:55 share between deposits and other borrowings.
ICRA Lanka notes that Top 10 depositors accounting for 15% of the companys total deposits as on June 30, 2017, indicates concentration in its deposits profile.
However, funding lines from 12 banks and good deposit renewal rate of 80% provides comfort from a liquidity perspective.

The 22-year-old American 10th seed fell 6-2, 7-6 in her first WTA event since losing to Sloane Stephens in the final at Flushing Meadows.

Jab Harry Met Sejal : Misses the zing!
Imtiaz Ali is known for enthralling hits with out of the box themes like Jab We Met, Love Aaj Kal, Cocktail, and Highway. Therefore when film buffs got the news that the filmmaker is going to direct Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan and the talented Anushka Sharma, the project was much looked forward to indeed.
Masses flocked to the theaters when it released only to return disappointed by the film which stretched on too long and was full of annoying clichs. The title itself is bland. The film was bound to be miserably mushy. It is so oblivious and predictable that you almost feel like fast forwarding to the end and just being done with the act.
The film canters around a tour guide named Harry who is forced to accompany a rich and spoilt and thoroughly annoying stereotype called Sejal back on the tour that they just completed to try and find her engagement ring which she seems to have lost on the way. She has apparently told her parents that she will get back to the country only when she finds the ring.
Shah Rukh does nothing in the film that he hasnt already done earlier. What is new for Anushka Sharma is only the Gujarati accent. Imtiaz Ali manages something he has not tried earlier. He collects fragments out of films of the recent years gone by and stitches up a patchwork that makes up Jab Harry Met Sejal.
Another downside in the movie is the unlikable female lead who does not go through much of a transformation to make her more likeable at curtain call. Sejal is a pure caricature and her Gujarati accent is hard on our ears. Though she tries hard to make her character cute and be sexy as she so desperately wants to be for Harry, the audience cannot help wishing her to be out of and out of ear shot too. In addition to this we feel a sense of mockery towards Harry for actually falling for the dame.
The only plus point in Jab Harry Met Sejal is the journey. The scenic beauty of Budapest, Prague, Berlin, Lisbon, Vienna, from the Amalfi coast to the Atlantic is captured bon camera and brought before the audience. However SRK and Anushkas annoying acts spoil the background beauty.
The story is peppered with so many songs that you lose count of them after a while. You actually stop caring for what will happen next or the plight of the characters.
Jab Harry Met Sejal is a lost cause from the word go. The ring is, of course, just a metaphor. Both are, of course, searching for the other. This is like the stuff that a very badly written Mills and Boon novel is made up of.
Watch this film if you are strictly a Shah Rukh Khan or Anushka Sharma fan. However this might take the cake and put you off them for a while too.

Japan pledges support to boost Lankan fisheries industry
The Japanese government has pledged to extend its fullest support for the development of Sri Lanka's fisheries industry and to strengthen Japanese market opportunities for Sri Lankan seafood exports, Fisheries Ministry sources said.
This was confirmed by Japanese State Minister for Foreign Affairs Masahisa Sato, during a discussion held with Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera who is currently on an official tour to Japan.
During the discussion, attention was drawn to the development of the fish processing industry in Sri Lanka.
It was discussed as to how the Japanese government could extend further assistance to boost the production of traditional Japanese raw fish products such as Sushi and Sashimi. Sri Lanka is currently manufacturing Japanese traditional meals such as Sushi and Sashimi which is made out of Tuna and they pay around Rs. 30,000 per kilo for the processed Tuna products.
During the discussion, Minister Amaraweera said that Japan is purchasing around 12 percent of Sri Lankan fisheries exports. They also purchase around 700 metric tons of Tuna annually, the ministry sources said.

JASTECA Institute of Management will hold a newly designed seminar on a concept titled 'Integration of Japanese Management Standards with ISO9001:2015 QMS International Standards' on Tuesday, October 3, at PIM.
Most managers assume that Japanese management teachings such as Toyota Production System, Kaizen, 5s and Lean Thinking are not aligned with ISO 9001:2015 international standard.
As a result, they try to run different programs with different responsibilities for Japanese and ISO 9001 systems separately. Good news is that both programs are heading towards the same final goal. However both Japanese and ISO QMS systems play different roles in the organizational journey towards performance excellence.
This seminar will be led by JASTECA Institute of Management and conducted by one of JASTECA's resource persons, who is also the President of Kaisha Kaisen Consultancies Kanishka Perera. He holds a Masters degree in Business Management from the University of Colombo.
He is a Trainer, Senior QMS Consultant/Lead Management Systems Auditor and Implementer (QMS, FSMS, ISMS, BCMS, EMS, TPS, Lean, Kaizen and Japanese 5s) and an external lecturer at the University of Moratuwa.
Perera has worked for over five years for Japanese manufacturers and service providers in managerial position and has more than 23 years of hands on industry experience.
Content of the program includes Introduction to TPS/Lean performance excellence journey with ISO9001:2015 QMS and TQM; Introduction to Quality (QC, QA and QM) and 7 Quality Management Principles; Explained new 10 clause high level structure of ISO9001 QMS 2015 version and links to Japanese Management standards implementation; ISO 9001 process approach with Japanese Hoshin Kanri; ISO 9001 Risk based thinking; Corrective actions with Kaizen and Innovations (5Ws and 1H); Management review with 3W project progress monitoring.
This program will guide a companys management to bring both, performance excellence programs and ISO9001:2015 QMS new standard implementation in one cockpit control dashboard with regular monitoring and follow-up. A company can begin their performance excellence Lean journey with correct knowledge and zero system overlaps and repetitions.

Dissanayake added that this election was postponed repeatedly due to electoral reforms which were introduced by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
Three more bills need to be brought before Parliament before the Local Government election is held and the Government has agreed to table them in the House on September 26, he said
He said that the Government has also agreed to summon special session on October 9 to get these Bills passed in Parliament.
Dissanayake added that his party voted in favour of Provincial Council Elections Amendment Bill without thinking of Provincial Council election as it wanted the Local Government election to be held first.
It is better to have Local Government election countrywide than holding the Provincial Council election only in three provinces, he said.

It has been revealed that the former Senior DIG had insisted to the OIC of the Kahawatte Police Station that Premalal Jayasekaras name not be included in the B Report filed by him.
A statement made by the OIC in this regard resulted in the SIU issuing a charge sheet against Jayasinghe on February 10, 2016.
Yesterday morning, Jayasinghe who was summoned to Police Headquarters for questioning by the SIU was arrested thereafter and produced before the Pelmadulla Magistrates Court.
The Senior DIG who is currently out on bail for harbouring, concealing and assisting the main suspect Mahalingam Sivakumar alias Swiss Kumar in the Vidya rape and murder case to flee and evade arrest was also suspended from the Police Department on July 20 by the Police Commission due to his involvement in Vidyas case. As the cases against Jayasinghe pile up, the High Court of Jaffna is scheduled to deliver its verdict on the Vidya murder case on Wednesday (28).

Sri Lanka and Maldives must jointly promote tourism targeting both destinations, said Minister of Finance Maldives, Ahmed Munawar.
Speaking to Daily News Business he said that this will not be a completion but a compliment for both nations. He said that both countries have two different products to offer and joint promotions would help to increase arrivals to both countries. One of the biggest advantage is the high air connectivity between the two countries.
Minister Munawar said that Maldives tourism and economy had being growing steadily and up to July they have received 700, 000 arrivals and this year they will come close upon the 1.5 million mark. We have seen bed nights increasing by 7% while there is also a sharp 14% increase in capacity. There has being a double digit growth from the European market and this may be the reason why 10 new resorts were opened last year alone. We see the growth in tourism continuing and the government is now investing heavily in to tourism infrastructure mainly targeting the international airport. The government has invested US $ 800 million for airport expansion and when completed it would be able to accommodate up to 7 to 10 million passengers. The present capacity is around 1.5 million.
In addition even the worlds biggest aircraft A380 too would be able to land in Males new airport which would be ready by end 2018. In addition the government would further invest US$ 40 million for the development of regional airports.
He also said for the first time the Country has received an international rating and they have also floated a bond to raise US$ 200 million and due to high demand closed it at US$ 400 million.
The Minister said that in a bid to attract a conference and meeting (MICE) market they would also build a large conference hall in Hulhumale Island which is now linked to the main airport by a road.
We are promoting Hulhumale as a destination for people to live in comfort and with huge apartment complexes, luxury bus transport service (a first for Maldives) lot space for recreation and leisure. We have also requested people living in heavily congested Male and far away lasiandras to come and live here. But this is purely voluntarily.
He said that they hope soon they would be able convert some of these less inhabited islands to build resorts.
He also said that the government is also investing over US$ 400 million in building a bridge over the sea linking both Hulhumale, International airport with the capital, Male. We expect this to be ready by end of 2018.
